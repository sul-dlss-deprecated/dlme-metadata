TT.g, MERCHANT BHIP P3mSOiT?7EL - LANBIhG AT BAHRAIN Sir, I have the honour to refer to the Senior Naval officer a copy of which has been lent to me by the Naval Officer-in- Charge Bahrain. 2 * Commander W.N.Benkart 1 s letter which forms an enclosure to the Senior naval officer 1 ® iecxer under reference deals with three specific questions. The first of these is shore leave for American merchant seamen and American Naval personnel serving in ships calling at Bahrain, the second is xhe desira bility of appointing an alditional American Naval Officor to the Bahrain area as Liaison Officer to deal with liaison work both here and © t Has Tanurah, and the third is the question of pilfering from cargo being unloaded by iiessrs* Gray Mackenzie &amp; Co., Ltd., from United St&amp;tew vessels. The Senior Naval Officer has raised only the first of these questions in his letter under r eference and therefore I do not feel called upon to put forward my views on the other two questions in this communication. Before however dealing with t he subject raised by the senior Naval officer I have certain general observations to record on the statements made in Commander Bankart*s communication. 3. Commander Bankart* s brief account of his interview with me does not give a very adequate picture of what actually took place. When the Commander called to see me on the 2oth May I raised the question of shore leave for merchant seamen with him and I explained carefully and fully the BahrainS|ov.-.rr*»«&gt;t had no fissire whatsoevar to incoavun.i anoc Aaiarican mcrnUant seamen. Ihers would bo no objection to tiheir landing at 3itrail Island, and to tbelr saving a cantoen and otiier faei- litiae tiiai-e, but -or a variety of reasons it was not considered desirable tnat they should enter tne tovms of -ianaaiah and fcahsrra^. I farther stated that all that was required before permission to land 'sas given was an assurance by some responsiole inoividaai or body that adequate arrangeiflents would be made to that Aricrlcan Merchant seaineii did not leave 3itrah Island but tnat so far no such assurance had been forthcoming from the Royal havy, or the C.S.Pnv,v, or the hafirain Petroleum Company, fhat sucii en «pswe®ce was desirable siad been made clear to me both from conversations I had had with various American Officers and civilians and by the conduct oi seme merchant seamen who landed £ Si brats after guarantees had been given by tueir Commanding Officer that they would remain there. 4 , The peanltlrate paragraph of Commander- Henkart* e wetter la slightly misleading possibly because the Commander is unaware of the events which followed ou the searching of the house of a Brltdeh Indian'subject of the name of dhatia who was suspected of being, in pomemi-on ot stolen property. 'Ihe house was search ed on my instructions and certain goods were discovered which ware at the time tho^ight to be the property of the U.S.Authoritic the Royal Navy, arid the Bahrain fetroleu® Cca^any. However during u.e course of the proceedings, so I * Magi stJ ‘fits* tryiry: the case, only two tins of biscuits, a few tins or butter, a negligible quantity of c' othing, and one towel have been identified by service und vil Company representatives. *fce cnea is still ui dor trial end X arr therefore precluded from givixqs any opinion on the result thereof but 7. think it worthy of record that tnc Be!ir«in foMco arc doing their utmost to cope wito pilfering frua morchantahipa and I under stand ere investi- gating various caeae at he: present tirnGe§• As regards the landing of American merchant aaamon the poaition is that there is not the slightest objection to the coming ashore provided they will restrict their ■c movements to certain areas but that owing to doubts with regard to their willingness to observe any restrictive regu lations it is considered necessary for adequate guarantees to be given* Ho such guarantees have so for boen given and tt*M4 Ciianv seamen have beau puTiuiasion W laud oxoapt on ne or two special occasions* It is clear from the senior Hnval Officer* s letter under reference that the Boyol Navy disclaim all rosponsibility for American Bemien on shore* I have been informed by th© U.B* Haval personnel here that not only will they not accept responsibility but that br~i* Haval pt rsonnel have no jurisdiction over merchant seamen on shore and cannot be used to maintain law and order among them in Bahrain. Th© Bahrain Petroleum Company who are particularly interested as the ultimate cause for American ships coming to Bahrain are disinclined to comjit themselves to any under taking for the enforcement of which they have no adequate means* 6- The Bahrain Police Force ie purely Asiatic and its employ .meat to deal with rowdyism among American sailors would not in opinion be desirable. The Bahrain itovernment might be hold to be responsible for the provision of an adequate polick force, and so they are in as far as the normal requirements of the State are concerned, but I do not consider that they can properly be desired to make special arrangements at their own expense for the crews of merchantships especially vhen thea* arrangements are rendered nocet'sary by '•ha tin nviadla r'»nnt.ntion of the persons concerned. liven if the Bahrain Government are hold to be responsible I am at a loss to think of any source from which European policemen could bo obtained7 • This is a question pertaining to the sea ana • and should therefore be dealt with by the Poyal Mavy. Provi ded the Naval auttiorities were prepared to isake available the noressary personnel to aot as a rastrietinq influance at Sitrah Island the difficulty of lack of Jurisdiction over American civilians could be overcome by enrolling them as special constables un ter King's Regulation No*2 of 1936. However the Senior NRval Officer has stated his opinion very clearly and so I suppose some other remedy must be found* The only other possible solutions thst^ean see at the moment are for the 0*3* Naval personnel in each ship to be empowered by their own authorities to deal with their own merchant seamen and for them to act in much the same way as is customary when a Eoyal Naval vessel miters any harbour and the man are given shore leave f that is to say, a naval picket ia landed by the ship concerned of what the Captain considers adequate strength to deal with any disorderly conduct, or for British Military Police personnel or American Military Provost personnel, prefe rably the formiir, to be posted hare for the specific purpose of dealing with merchant seamen both British and American. The Military Police could be empowered by *o to act as special constables in the same way as sugge tad in the eaoe of naval ratings* Of these VWfOiUl ao1utd«w« wM*h T Hava suites ted personally 1 am strongly in favour of the costing of an adequate force of British Military Police. \ I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedniont servant, Political Agent, Bahrain* Ole18 / 8 .

We are disappointed at this change of attitude by the Americans on a matter which we hoped had been satis factorily settled on the linos recorded in the minutes of qj_ the 6 th meeting v/ith Mr .Wallace Murray last April. The present proposal would of course involve the surrender by 3' us, in respect of United States nationals, of the rights of jurisdiction which we at present possess over all foreigners in Bahrein, and such a stop would clearly have the most adverse effects on our prestige and position generally in the Island. Vie feel, therefore, .that there can be no question of accepting the United States Govern ment's proposal (which indeed indicates a perpetuation in the State Department of the misunderstanding of the situation which Mr .Murray admitted to exist).

In conclusion it might be added that H.M.G. very much hope that the United States Government will on reconsideration see their way to accept the proposals tentatively arrived at in the discussions with Mr .Wallace Murray, which will not only in fact ensure to all Americans the fair trial to be expected from a British Judge, but will it is trusted remove &lt;. y possible misgivings on their part that their difficulti s arc not appreciated. • .

Arrange ments will be made by the Department to obtain a suitable person act in this capacity and to make available funds for the payment of his compensation* In conclusion, the Department’s telegram emphasizes again the urgent necessity of making suitable , arrangements immediately for the administration of justice with respect to American citizens in the Bahrein Islands. .0 s' Sincerely yours, (Signed) H.BUCKNELL, Jnr.
