A Commission was sent to investigate the matter, on whose report Abdul Ghannee Pasha was reinstated. ^ . The robber Chief of the Beni-Hajir, Za'eed -bin-Mohammed, is still at large, and was heard of in El-Katr as described below. El-Katr —The year passed on the whole quietly as regards the sea, the only piracies reported being committed by Za^eed-bin-Mohammed as usua{ but they were trifling! In June it was reported that this worthy had seized a vessel belonging to Jasim-bin-Mohammed with Ilupees 200 or 300 worth of pearls, and he subsequently was said to have captured a boat belonging to El-Wakrah, the people of which place pursued him unsuccessfully. Za^eed must be in a comparatively affluent circumstances from the proceeds of his exploits by sea an ^ and there seems no prospect of his being brought to account by the luikish authorities, it is to be hoped he may feel m a position to 1 ' etir ® business of piracy. Any remonstrances with the lurkish authouties are usually met by the simple plan of denying the tacts. The old Shaikh of the Al-bu-Kuwarah, Mohammed-bin-Sa'eed, has died. * • i j i Some raids have occurred in the vicinity of El-B 1( k a, the Manaseer and 'Awamir Bedouins being the aggressors. These affairs are likely to become more serious in the future. The proceedings of Nasir -bin-Mubarik have been described under head of Bahrain. A complaint was made of unjust imprisonment and ill-treatment of two Hindoo traders at EUBida'a by order of the Kadhi, a lurkish official. In this case Jasim -bin-Mohammed-Tham took the part ot the traders. The case was referred to the Turkish Arabian authorities through the Political Agent. .The Kadhi was subsequently removed. El-Bida'a was visited by Her Majesty's Ships Beacon and Woodlark. The latter grounded on a sand-bank at the entrance of the harbour, and the inhabitants exerted themselves satisfactorily, and were remunerated for their labour and boats. The Turkish gun-boat Zokiff and despatch vessel ArJcadi have been stationed on the Hasa Coast, the latter having lain about a month at Bahrain. 5. Southern Persia and Persian Beloochistan. Arahistan. —No changes of importance have occurred in this pro vince which continues under the rule of His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan. Haji Jabir Khan, Nusrut-ul-Mulk, Governor of Moham- merah, has somewhat rallied in health. jf ars , The government of Ears remained in the hands of His Roval Highness Prince Earhad Mirza, Mo'ternid-ed-Dowlah, until the expiration of the Persian official year, which ends at the vernal equinox, or Nowroz. Sometime after that date it became known that His Royal Highness the Zil-cs-Sultan had been nominated Governor otadministration report of the persian gulf political Pars in addition to his already extensive charge, which comprises Ispaliau, Yezd, Barojird, Lunstan and Arabistan. It was announced that the Zil-es-Sultan s youthful son, Jelal-ed-Dowlah, would be sent to reside at Shiyaz as nominal Deputy Governor, under the tutelag-e of an oflicial titled the 'Sahib-i-Diwan/'' lately employed under the Heir- apparent at labriz, a brother of the well-known Shiraz notables the Kowwam-ul-Mulk and Nusseer-ul-Mulk. This further extension of the Zil-es-Sultans power has naturally excited a good deal of comment as to its significance; but the Prince has earned of late years a name for administrative ability and impartiality combined with strictness and energy, which leads people to hope his rule over Fars will be successful In the interim, between the deposal of the Mo'temid-ed-Dowlah and arrival of the young Prince, the government of the province is admin istered by the Kowwam-ul-Mulk, who, in spite of the anticipations of disorder, has succeeded in suppressing any attempts in that direction. Ihe Mo temid-ed-Dowlah^s son and able assistant. Prince ^Owais Mirza, Ihtisham-ed-Dowlah, Governor of Behbehan, has also been Relieved, and his successor is not yet known. , The Mo temid-ed-Dowlah has been ^Governor-General of Fars since August 1876, and so has enjoyed an unusually long tenure of office. 11 is administration has been in many respects eminently successful, it is said particularly so as regards himself. His first act was to depose and disgtace the Mushir-ul-Mulk, formerly the all-powerful Wazeer for Fars, and this was speedily followed by stern and ruthless suppression of lobbery and all unlicensed (the qualification is nece ssary) crime throuo-h- out the province. The roads soon became perfectly safe, and have remained so ever since. As regards other results of this Prince's admin istration opinions are divided. All admit that the revenues were col lected to the last farthing, no matter how bad the season, and that perhaps one-third in excess of the assessments was levied throughout the province. But, on the other hand, the Prince allowed no interference of others, and himself watched the revenue branch of the administration closely, so that it is thought by some that, as compared with the admin istration of more lenient but more careless governors, the balance has been to the benefit of the population by the extortions of rapacious middlemen being kept in check. However this may be, it is a fact that the province is much depleted, and in many districts visibly on the down- waid track. In fertile valleys one passes villages once numbering their hundreds, now reduced to five or six squalid huts. Inquiry as^to the causes of this always elicits the same explanation— &lt;c zulm/^ One act of the Mo'temid-ed-Dowlah's seems to have been almost universally condemned by the public opinion throughout Fars the execution of Shaikh Mazkoor Khan of Kangoon, which was briefly alluded to in last year's report. The commiseration which the fate of this rebel Khan received, arose from the fact that he was notoriously driven into rebellion by sheer desperation. When formerly a prisoner at Shiraz, the Shaikh bought his release by promising to pay a sum far beyond his means of raising, and when pressed, met force by force and fled to a mountain fortress. • Lured out by treachery, he was forced, though sorely wounded, to ride post in fetters to Shiraz, where ominousEESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1880-81. 9 preparations were made to put him to a cruel death immediately on arrival. The presence of some European spectators m the throng- seems to have served so far to mitigate the form of punishment that the Shaikh was simply strangled at the foot of the scaffold and the corpse gibbeted on a gallows over which was inscribed an ironical legend. A few of Shaikh Mazkoor's followers were put to death at the same time. It may be remarked that death by strangling is usually reserved for Khans and persons of some dis- Vide Appendix B, Note. tinction, more vulgar offenders being dismissed by cutting the throat with a knife. His Royal Highness the Mo 'temid-ed-Dowlah, during his tenure of the government o£ Pars, maintained very friendly relations with the British officials. In April 1880 the Resident accompanied by his stall, proceeded to Shiraz to visit the Prince, and was received with much distinction and courtesy. The local politics of Shiraz, the seat of Government are at a times somewhat variable and intricate. How power and influence will be distributed under the new regime cannot be safely predicted. I think it not out of place, however, to attach, as an appendix to this part of the report, selected extracts Appendix B* £ rom an interesting and useful memo randum of observations on the politics and people of Fars, which was written by Captain E. L. Durand, late Assistant Political Resident in 1879, and submitted in another form. The Eel-Khani of the Kashgais is Sultan Mohammed Khan, who resides at Firozabad. Complaints of exactions were made against him by the inhabitants of that district. Dfoib Khan, the Eel-Begi, was at one time in danger of being deposed, being in arrears of the amount of revenue expected from him. A collision occurred between Darib Khan and his followers and the people of the district of Falard, arising from hostility between the Kashdais and the Bakhtiyari Eels. Owing to two consecutive seasons of dearth, prices of food rose throughout South Persia to famine rates, and much distress existed in the summer and autumn. This has been relieved by the plentiful rain fall of last autumn and winter. It was announced that a sum of 100,000 tomans was to be raised from Fars as a contribution to the expenses of the military operations against the rebellious Kurds. A sum of 25,000 tomans was actually collected. BusJiire. —At Bushire the case of claims of British merchants against one Abdul Nubbee, who has attempted to defraud Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co. in a large amount, has continued to occupy attention, i he Governor of Bushire having declined to act further m the case, and improper influence having been brought to bear by Persians of high * The ghastly scene was photographed from -an adjoining palace by a lively young scion of royalty.]0 administration report OF the persian GULF POLITICAL position in support of the defaulter, a special a^ent was sent from leheran ostensMy from the Foreign Office, with orders to enforce settle- meut. -The case is still under discussion.

The population o£ Pars may be resolved into two distinct elements the settled and the nomad. The first known as the ' Dehiiti,' or « Del/ mshin (the dwellers in villages), quiet, cowardly, and inoffensive' Ihc second known as the Eehyat, or Chadar-nishm, the trihes [from the Mongol] or dwellers in tente, who form a most characteristic and most interesting part of the population, which from its character, tor. bulent spirit, recklessness, and intestine quarrel lino-, modifies or dpfov mines to a great extent the policy of the local Government. It is true that Government itself often favors these intestine brawls to serve its down S ' Spint lawIessness is too strong to be easily kept The Dehati, or Deh-nishm, would appear to have been attached from time immemorial to the soil, and forms the class of labourers and agriculturists. I am told that it is an open question whether they are not the descendants of an ancient aboriginal race which was probablv subdued when the Iranian tribe separating from their Aryan brethren m India invaded Persia, and which from that time probably had to adapt themselves to the language of their conquerors. It is very pos sible that physiological facts may lead up to such a conclusion which would be quite analogous to what has been observed in other countries now occupied by other branches of the Aryan race. As a confirmation of this view, it is urged that the shape of the skull of these raceTand ™ e ir wr# ° • the pure Arab aild Turkis h tribes, present a marked difference in size and direction of development and fW+1.! peculiar Aryan shape is most marked in some of these villao-e population To an ordinary observer or traveller, however the frenenl of the race do not differ from the siu-roundir^rpnhfcionrr^lf 08 extent as to call immediate attention to its peculiarity as is the cat in ndia with Bhils, Gonds, and such like, probably aboriginal inhabitants However this may be, it is very certain that on [he shores of the Gulf' foi at any rate some thousand years, there has been a constant influx of Auab blood, and there are villages, such as Qhakutah, Abutavil and others between Buslure and Borasgun, inhabited by Arabs who' still speak with, I believe, small variations, their original mother tongue.

Kurdish remnants at any rate have certainly emigrated into Persia. I came across one man during my wanderings with the history of some such flitting riesn in his memory. Besides these elements of village population, there is also a residue gathered from some of the more ancient Eehyat tribes who have given up their wandering habits and settled down as treated of below when glancing at the supposed composition of the larger villages and towns. Generally speaking, the Eeliyat looks down upon the village popu lation, and in truth they are usually harmless and peaceable; the Tangistanis however, and the men of Ardakun, have a great name for courage. The former were, it is said, responsible for the only resistance that was met with by the force sent to Persia in 1856, and fought well. In the case of these the pluck is probably to be traced to a strong infusion of the Arab; in the case of the men of Ardakun to a strain ot the Lur blood. We may, then, tentatively class the nomad population of Fars under three heads;— (1 ) Mrs —The Lur tribes, whom I am told speak almost pure Persian, but with which I have as yet no acquaintance, comprising the Mamasseni with their divisions, whose country may be said roughly to lie south and west of the mighty Dena range into Behbehan; the Koho-elu with their divisions and minor tribes occupying part ot the same districts; and lastly, the Bakhtiari, who are popularly supposed to come from Balkh, and said to speak pure Persian patois, now certainly the must prominent tribe in Southern Persia under the direct govern- ment of Ispahan, whose summer and winter quarters stretch from the Karun to Ispahan, and march with those of the Kashgae and the Mamasseni. This with regard to Fars, for properly the Governor of Arabistan, now Hishmet-ed-Dowlah t Now dead. „ ^ „ (Hamza Mirzaf), nncle of the Shah, and (Sd.) E. C. oss. brother to t h e p r ince Governor of Fars, is the ruler to whom the Bakhtiari Chief is subordinate ; but as their tribes are scattered in Fars, as well as in Arabistan, i.e., in districts suHordinate to the Ispahan Government, not Fars as a governorship, those which are in Ispahan are subject to the Zd -es -Sultan, and the remainder are subject to the Lrovernor % All now under His Royal Highness 0 £ Arabistan. J The Mamasseni, on the Zil-es- Sultan, 1881. other hand, are under the immediate iurisdiction of the Behbehan Government, and the Kashgae under Fars. The government of Behbehan may, however, I think, be described as a Lieutenant-Governorship dependant on Fars4 -x- * * * * * (2.) The Turkish Eeliyat, comprising the Kashgae, formerly a power in Fars, but now poor and broken, and too near the Shiraz powerADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL to have much chance of regaining their former status and wealth. Those known as the Eel-i-Khamesh, of which I am informed there is also an Arab tribe, and a number of smaller tribes brought down forcibly, or attracted at various times, from the northern parts of Persia and the Caucasian provinces of Russia. ... r ^ ie Arab Eeliyats who emigrated some centuries ago, and still speak an Arab patois. With these I have as yet no personal ac quaintance; they are generally held to be a very troublesome and dan gerous element amongst the populations, being nomadic and turbulent in the extreme. Those lying within the bounds of the Government of Pars would seem to be principally wandering in countries, as yet unex- plored by Europeans, between Yezd and Shiraz, having summer quarters in the hills of Baonat and other places. • ri i he i r - e is Stil1, ho T ever ' anotb er element in the population, viz. the inhabitants of the big towns, who would seem to be a mixture of the Persian original and the scum of the stranger; such Turkish Eeliyats and others who, from the breaking up of their whole tribes, severe pressure of taxation, or other causes, have become disintegrated, and clung in small parties to the nearest rock of shelter, such asylum beino- in most cases a large town as being presumably able to afford them protection, and at any rate a present refuge from the attacks of stronger nomad brethren with whom they would in their broken state be unable to cope, and near whose grazing grounds they could not venture. As an example, I would mention the fate of the once powerful Lak tribes who, it is said, came down during the reign of Nadir Shah and Karim Khan /end from their own country round Kirmanshah. These having lost sight of their tribal duties have no longer a name amongst the Eel? but have been gradually and completely absorbed into the town popu lations. r r v heads or tlie rulers of nomad tribes, usually styled Eel-Khani and Eel-Begi are, I believe, invariably chosen from amongst themselves, and apparently in an arbitrary manner, every year, if necessary, by the ruler for the time being, although, naturally enough, from the leading families in wealth or power; the former attribute, it is almost needless to sav depending very generally on the latter. The present Eel-Begi of the Kashgaes, though a well known man. being the brother of a better known Zohrab Khan, who had his throat cut by the orders of the Prince Motamid-ed-Dowlah, does not belono- to the best families apparently, but is the creature of Ihtisham-ed &amp; - iJowlah, who saved him from death when the hangman's noose had already begun to tighten. He received his khillut to the exclusion of Nasirulla Khan, the late Eel-Begi, on a promise of paying an enhanced revenue of 6,000 tomans. This he will have to wring from the already impoverished brethren of his tribes, and, to do him justice, no qualms ot conscience are likely to stand in his way when making the attempt. A haid man and fanatical. If the stories about him and his own hand some hard countenance are to be believed, he will go for the obiect in view with cynical determination. I asked Haji Nasirulla Khan, the man whom he had supplanted, how it was possible for him to do this. The reply was, he cannot^RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1880-81. 19 liis khillut will cost him his head; he will be unable to raise the sura, and will send excuses to the Shahzadeh, and refuse to come in ; he will then become an outlaw, as well as what he already is, a robber. This, however, being apparently the legitimate trade o£ every man in Fars, from Kajar Prince to Lur shepherd, the sting was somewhat lost. Amongst the Kashgae, at any rate, it is considered somewhat disoraceful to return no richer than on setting out from any expedition, the ladies as usual being somewhat at the bottom of the mischief, as they strongly discourage lazy habits of returning home empty-handed, unless they are much belied in both brothers and husbands. The trade is of course plied according to the personal courage or official opportunities of each man. A wholesome dread of the Shahzadeh alone saves Fars from becoming a pandemonium. The leading families of these tribes are nearly all related by mar- riao-e to each other, but that forms no bond of friendship in Persia, where a man^s foes are those of his own household j their coidial detes tation of the Kajar ruler, even not being strong enough to make them sink individual differences and form combinations; nor is it easy to see how they could begin to learn to trust each other, as all seem equally faithless. Beyond the old-fashioned ' divide and govern' policy, there is nothino- in Persia, for every man tries to extort as much money as he can by'fair or foul means during his tenure of office. This a Governor well knows will be short, as he cannot be allowed to grow tat or till his stomach,' as they expressly term it, any more than he himself is likely to allow any one under him to perform such a gratifying opera tion. There is no such thing as a public purse in the country, and all that a man can squeeze beyond the assessment belongs to ni msel1 ; 1 money that finds its way to Teheran belongs to the Shah, and though oblio-ed to disburse certain sums for army, &amp;c., the hoarded amount, of which he alone has the custody, is supposed to be very considerable. Under such a system of absolute despotism and spoliation a man can never be allowed to remain long enough to ' fill his stomach,' and then, perhaps, take an interest in those under him, lighten the taxation, and improve his farm. The Bakhtiari ruler seems to be an exception to this rule as yet, but signs are not wanting to show that his tenure of power may be rudely shaken ere long. I repeat that if a man show signs of wealth, be he prmce or peasant, he is at once a marked man, and rarely escapes. I will merely allude to the downfall of Ali Kuli Khan, formerly a most powerful Chief, and the Eel-Begi of the Kashgae, as usual betrayed by a relation; to the tragic fate of the brave Hyder Khan of Dashti; to that of the Mus ir- ul-Mulk, of whom more anon; and lastly to the loss of the Eel-Begi- ship last year by Haji Nasirulla Khan * # Shaikh Maztur Khan of Kangun ^ these are good instances, some of the might now be added, 1881. ma y ^ vq not been without fault, but there is only one really and always punishable fault m Persia, and that is a refusal to part with large sums on extortion. Were the Chiefs of the tribes to combine loyally together, it would be impossible ror20 ADMINISTRATION REPOUT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL a Government really weak, as are these Persian ones, to demand more tlian a fair amount of revenue; but the deep distrust of each other so reasonably entertained in a land, where honour and faith are a dead letter, militates against any such cohesive action. ****** With regard to the nomad tribes, then, we see the policy of the rulers plainly, i .e., a change as often as possible, either when the ruler is ripe enough to be sucked and thrown away, or when another man will offer a higher price to farm the tribe. With regard to the settled village and town population, the extrac tion of a large amount of revenue is an easier task than in the ca^e of the nomads. The country is divided into districts or bulooks, whose head is usually at Shiraz within reach of the Priuce Governor, the nobles are usually ordered in once a year, and may not leave without distinct permission; he is responsible for the revenue of the district, and has his own agents on the spot to collect it. These again look to the Khed-Khudas, as the persons immediately responsible for their own village payments, and the district has to raise enough money somehow, both to pay the Government assessment and to fill the maws of all these middle men. This is one reason why taxation is felt as such a tre mendous grievance, but there are many more. The worthy Khed- Khudas and Kalanters exempt their own particular friends from a share in the necessary payments. The Seyyids generally scrape through also, and thus the burden falls unequally. There are also many small indi rect taxes levied, such as those levied by pa-sing troops, by sowars of the Governor, and travelling big men generally. In one word the village community, or the paying part of it, are obliged to find double and sometimes treble the amount fixed upon them by Government. Travellers have remarked constantly on the poverty of Persia, meaning, I take it, the poverty of the inhabitants, and not that of the soil, for that, wherever water touches, is extremely fertile; and this appearance of great poverty, a true expression of the state of the people in most places is enhanced by the fact that no man dares to appear-abroad decently dressed. Such a sign of being well-to-do would immediately subject him to extortionate pressure. The greatest argu ment that could be put forward in support of my view of the intrinsic fertility, and natural capabilities of Fars, would be to point to the number of inhabitants still remaining, the system of perfectly scientific mis- government, and the time during which this has been gradually attaining its present pitch of perfection without actually depopulating the country, and then to draw attention to the still large revenue extracted from the province, which is always allowed to be over a crore per annum, and which must be considerably more, the octroi being comparatively insignificant. All this is wrung from the wretched peasantry and Eeliyats of Fars. The remedy for this state of horrible barbarism is not easy to see. Optimists insist upon it that, even under present circumstances were the tribes settled, government could be carried on more safety, and the burden of taxation would consequently be lessened. This neither follows, nor do I agree. In the first place, the wealth of tiie Eel tribes lies in their flocks and herds, and in this country a change of pastureI RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL ' AGENCY FOR 1880-81. 21 lands is absolutely necessary in accordance with the changing- of seasons. Could this even be obviabed and the tribes settled and forced to dwell m villages, Government might fatten for a year or two, for this indeed is the only object of every Persian Government; but the country would be so completely at its mercy that population would inevitably decrease from actual want. The only remedy I see for unhappy Persia lies in ^ome contact with the outside world, and thence in the chance of some dawn ot civil ization. But rulers and moollahs know too well that such dawn would herald the downfall of their privileges and power, and both will otter every obiection, and strain every nerve to keep outside knowledge ami influence where it now is. The system of taxation, as sketched above, gives rise to a custom that prevails to some extent of a certain )ei Sf families of a tribe, or even of a village population, bolting, and then denyino- their obligations both towards the Government they have escapecf from, and the Government in whose territory they have taken refuge. This also becomes another minor cause of the inequality in the incidence of taxation. In the towns themselves the taxation is said to be imposed through the heads of the different guilds who are told off to realise the amount inflicted. Besides this, the towns are divided into muhallehs, or quarters, to simplify the extractive process, each quarter having an officer in charge of the collections. The outlying, and consequently less get-at-able districts are often more than lax in sending in their share, and this necessitates a tour on the part of some trusted Government official for the collection ot the taxes. Prince Ihtisham-ed-Dowlab, Now withdrawn, 1881. the son of Yirhad Mirza, Governor of Ears, is of great assistance to his father in this way, and makes a yearly tour with great advantage to himself, and no doubt to his father s com plete satisfaction. ****** That the population of Fars is made up of many and different races, none will deny, but the hank is in great confusion, and it will require a man of special linguistical and scientific power to separate and elassity the threads. * * -x- * * * 'Politics of Fars. —I must here call attention to a few facts which it is necessary to keep in mind whilst reading what follows. It is impossible to give an idea of the state of politics in Fars; and I doubt not in the whole of Persia also, without saying once for all and distinctly that it hinges absolutely on the one word Mudakhil, so thoroughly understood in Southern Persia. ' Mudakhil is a commis sion that which a man gets for himself out of a trust reposed on him, whether the organized robbery of a prince, or the peculations ot a servant.22 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL All belief in high aims, in desire to promote the welfare of country or People on the part of the rulers, must be at once eliminated, and the tact boldly grasped that there is one sole aim and object in all Persian policy to keep power for yourself in order to be able to extract money, i Ins denmtion applies from the highest in rank to the Deputy Execu- inner or the Ferrash, which latter gentleman indeed often draws a con siderable sum of money whilst laying on the bastinadoe. The obvious rider to this policy of personal interest is that you should never allow another man to become too powerful or rich when such power may be fraught with danger to yourself, and when a scheme the spoliatkm'of Mmf 113 ll0Wn£a '' Pr0bably give ^0,, a sllare 111 ■nv , Having said thus much plainly, I will give an account of Prince *irhad Mnza s accession to power as gathered from different relations to myselr. In order to do this, I must present the Mushir-ul-Mulk to notice. He is a grey-bearded keen-eyed old man, tall, and courtly, carrying his seventy odd summers very lightly, and known for his courtesy to Europeans. Some three years ago he was a power of no mean order in Fars, and indeed from his still enormous wealth and stubborn enmity is yet to be feared by the Prince Governor, as he will never leave a stone unturned to obtain revenge. In the time I speak of lahia Khan was Governor of Fars, but he was apparently a weak ruler. Hence it was the policy of the all powerful Mushir to keep the province in a state of ferment for his own advantage. Several powerful Chiefs enjoyed his support and protection, and in return he obtained a laro-e mudakhil out of the proceeds of their robberies. I have seen almost the same system covertly carried on by the smaller, and even by bio- Chiefs in Kajpootana only a few years ago. The end of this state of things was the recall of Yahia Khan as being unable to keep the province Tn order, and it was then offered to the Hishmet-ed-Dowlah, brother to the present ruler. 1 he three brothers, uncles of the Shah, had all bound themselves to refuse, and the Hishmet refused at once. MVtemid-ed- Dowlah was, however, tempted by his greed of gold, unable to refuse, and whilst swearing he would never consent, consented. This breach of convention led to an estrangement between the brothers, and the difficulty was not bridged over until Mo'temid-ed-Dowlah had promised to disgrace the Mushir-ul-Mulk, on which a return of friendship was assured At the very first levee held by the Prince, he taxed the Mushir with some ot his many peccadilloes, no difficult task, and gradually warming- to his work, finally cried out ' to the sticks with him.' He was beaten most savagely, being then an old man of over seventy years, and the pithy telegram to his brother from the Mo^temid would appear to have ™ SatlS ^ d n ° W . ? ' Incautious letters written by the Mushir-ul-Mulk to a robber Chief, who had been taken, were found upon the latter, and supplied the immediate excuse wanted, and evidence that could not be controverted From that day the Mushir has been a ruined man, but his wealth is still enormous. Our sympathies however fail to tollow him not on account of his implication with robber Chiefs, for that may almost be looked at in the light of a custom of the country but from calling to remembrance the share he had in helping the late Eel-RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1880-81. 23 Kliani in his scheme for the treacherous apprehension and ruin of their joint friend, Ali Kuli Khan, late Eel-Begi of the Kashgaes, in spite of oaths and protestations of friendship. The old man still lives to tell the tale, and his sons to take a not improbable revenge at some future date; though the power of the family is indeed gone, and the power of the clan broken, this latter having been further weakened by losses during the famine of 1870. This punishment of the Mushir-ul-Mulk, the biggest man in Ears, was thus the inaugural address of Prince Firhad Mirza to his nobles on taking up the reins, a better example of what he was, and how he intended to rule, could scarcely have been given. But even such an example as this has not proved enough in many cases. I may sum up the characteristics of Prince Firhad Mirza's rule by saying that it is one of blood and gold; both he must have somehow or other, though the latter will, 1 believe, in rare cases, buy back the former. * * * * I have spoken above of Prince Ihtisham-ed-Dowlah, son of the Mo'temid. He holds the position of Governor of Behbehan, and in addition to this is employed by his father to make a regular yearly tour for the purpose of extracting money from the districts that lie at some little distance from the central power. As an instance of the ups and downs of Persian life, I cannot do better than quote a passage from this Prince's history :— He was Governor of Behbehan, a sub-government under Shiraz or Fars, before his father's accession to the province. The country had been unquiet, and he had been unable to collect enough money to pay up his assessed revenue. AVith considerable exertion, however, he managed to collect a large herd of animals of all sorts, and forwarded them to Shiraz to be sold, the proceeds being destined to the treasury of the Central Government. The Mushir then in the zenith of his power, heard of the coming cattle, and quietly arranged for the robbery of them. This took place near Shiraz, and the Ihtisham -ed-Dowlah, now pressed and helpless, had to pack up his tents, and with a few followers, beat an immediate retreat to the mountain. Whilst thus in the actual flight a telegram reached him announcing his father's accession to Fars. The hasty retreat was immediately turned into a triumphal march back to wards the capital, and it is hard to believe the received theory that he did not know what was in store for the Mushir in open Durbar a few hours after his arrival, for he is thoroughly trusted by his father. What is certain, however, is that he remained in apparently friendly intercourse with him to the last—to within an hour of his deep disgrace. * * * * The Kawdm. —The Kawam-ul-Mulk comes next to notice. He is the great enemy of the Mushir, and I had almost said the confidential adviser of the Governor; but the term 'trusted subordinate' will con vey his position better with regard to the Prince. He is pleasant and straightforward without the usual defect of attempting a false excess of courtesy in his manner to strangers; he is lame owing to a fall from his horse, when his gun went off and the ball through his foot.24 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL mmtiJoi StF CMetS 1 l ' aVe already SOme accomit 111 Nasirullah Kkan.—Oi Nasirullah Khan, last year's Chief of the Kashgaes 1 gave some account before. He is decidedly one of the best Persians I have come across. Though he has never had the chance of leaving Persia, and has therefore had only the ordinary Persian educa tion, he has evidently thought deeply on many subjects, and holds views on religion and politics which would make the moollahs and governors ot lersia open their eyes. He also is related to Ali Kuli Khan bv marriage. ^ Mrdb Khan —mrnh Khan, the present Chief, is a handsome man ot rather an Afghan cast of countenance; was formerly, it is said, one of the boldest robbers m Persia, a ' bon vivant,' and troubled with no religious scruples The murder of his brother, and his own narrow escape fiorn a brutal death, sobered whilst it hardened him.

He is known to be greatly in favor of throwing open the Karun river to trade, having a keener eye to his own interests than is apparently pos sessed by any one at Teheran. I met his son the other day at Bussorah a pleasant manly boy enough, and received an invitation to visit the tribe. He was then on his way to Mecca, where he arrived safely some time since.

Death is usually inflicted by the cord- when the otender is a person of good social standing, by' the knife, m the primitive fashion of the shambles, in the case of common malefactors.

This death is less revolting than others which are inflicted. The most common form of punishment, in fact quite a national institution of Persia, is 'sticks,' that is a bastinado, the soles of the feet being 1 beaten until a certain number of sticks have been broken over Torture is much resorted to both to extort confessions (or bribes) and as a punishment. The clever versatile Persian mind displays pecu liar ingenuity in the pursuit of evil, and the list of tortures in vogue is as varied as revolting. Within the immediate influence of the capital, no doubt this is now much checked, and the higher officials would not, as a rule, tolerate the barbarities which are known to occur. It is fortu nate for the people of Persia that their nervous sensibility is usually dull, for they are liable to agonizing torments on very small pretence. It is a common expression to hear that such a prisoner has been ' an noyed' by his guards, and on inquiring the precise form of 'annoyance, you are told perhaps that sharp wedges have been driven under the nails of his hands and feet, or he has been kept from sleeping tor several nights running by constant pricking with sharp instruments. thp nrdinarv forms of capital punishment, there are some them.* of the spectators. disposer of his fate. * Note.—L of punishing attached to the establishment.

Political. —The official year 1879-80 ended peacefully, and notliing more than the usual intertribal quarrels had occurred to disturb the tranquillity of the country. In May a body of 200 of the Beni-boo- Ali arrived at Muscat from Soor by sea, with the object apparently o coercing His Highness Seyyid Toorkee, the tribe having been misled by exaggerated rumours regarding the detention of^ Esa -bin-Ras i , Meskeree, who had been prevented landing in 'Oman from suspicion o his having brought supplies of money and arms from Zanzibar to assis Saleh-bin-Ali in a projected rising against His Highness, ibe suspicion proving groundless, Esa-bin-Rashid was allowed to proceed to his lome, and on the way met another party of the Beni-boo-Ah en route to Muscat, whom he turned back. In August disquieting rumours reached His Highness that Hamoo - bin-Said, El Jahafee, intended marching on Muscat and raiding the Batinah, but it soon appeared that his object was to attack the wamir tribe, which he did near Kuriateyn with a loss of six killed on each side. In the same month Seyyid Peysal-bin-Toorkee was appointed a i o Semail, and Seyyid Fahd, his younger brother. Wall of Burlca. nis Highness Seyyid Toorkee also proceeded to Burka for a change, and thence visited Semail, returning to Muscat on the 10th Septembei.^ Shaikh Hamood shortly after again attacked the Awamir; this time with a slight loss to himself and none to his enemy. His tollowing then dispersed. In September a feud arose between the Hishim and the Beni-boo-Hassan tribes in Jaalan, owing to the latter having shelter to a murderer and refused his surrender. In this quarre! the surrounding tribes soon became more or less involved, and i rea cue to assume wider proportions. The Beni-boo-Hassan haying^ receive a check from the Jenebeh, called on their allies,the Harth and Hejiieyeen, or assistance, but this proceeding was met by a warning from the Irhattirees that any coalition of the Hinawis would lead to general hostilities and the Beni-boo-Hassan therefore refrained. The mediation ot Shai Salehbin-Ali was suggested, but does not appear to have had any result.

Note on the Tribes of 'Oman by Lietjtenant-Colonel S. B. Miles. The aceompanyiiig table includes all the more important Arab tribes in the kingdom, and gives their estimated numbers, distribution, &amp;c., but has no pretensions to be exhaustive. Short notes have been added on some of the larger tribes, and their sub-divisions have been given where known. Each o£ these clans is derivable from one or other of the two great stocks known to Arab genealogists as Kahtani and 'Adndni. The former being also known as Yemeni, and the latter as MVaddic and Nizar. The Yemen tribes are believed to have immigrated into 'Oman first. They are still the most numerous and have, modernly, furnished the rulers of the country. In the true Semitic spirit these rival races have been in open and continuous antagonism from the time of their first settlement, and, like the famous Yemen and Modhar wars in Syria in old days, the Yemen and Nizar factions in 'Oman have ever kept the country in perpetual turmoil and disruption with their feuds. Since the early part of the 18th century, the names of Yemen and Nizar have been metamorphosed into Hinawi and Ghaffiree, respectively, and every tribe, large and small, is now comprised in one or other of these poli- tical 'factions. Let it be noted, however, that these party names do not necessarily denote the descent of a tribe. It has suited the interests of some of them to change sides. The origin of the assumption of the names Hinawi and Ghatfiree was first explained by Colonel Ross in his memorandum of tribes published in 1872, which the present list is intended to supplement. Theoretically the sub-division of Arab tribes is very elaborate, extending to ten or more grades, but in practice it is ' usually very simple. In 'Oman the tribes are divided first into Fakhooth*, and then each Fakhth is sub-di.vided into beits or * Primary meaning 'thighs.' The houses. In the notes the word sept has form of plural is post-classical Omani ^ een U s e (J to represent Fakhth. dialect. E. C. R. ^ ver y f ew of the 'Oman tribes is there a head Shaikh commanding the obedience of all, but there is con siderable diversity in this respect. Generally each Fakhth has its own Shaikh, who considers himself independent of the others—a system which effectually preserves the disunion of the tribes, and causes endless iealousies and quarrels. There are, however, about half a dozen Shaikhs or ' Temeemehs' in 'Oman, who possess real power over their subjects and wield it despotically. The Shaikhship is usually hereditary, and is assumed by the eldest male .in the family unless he be incapable. The larger tribes are mostly grouped together in leagues in each district according to politics for the purpose of supporting each other when attacked; while the weaker tribes are compelled to place themselves in cliency to those more powerful. These ' clients,' however, generally remnants of some ancient tribe, are accustomed to maintain themselvesresidency and muscat political agency for 1880-81, 3'3 Table showing the Tribes op 'Oman with their numbers and distribution— concluded.

The ' Temeemeh ' of the tribe is Shaikh Hilal-bin-Ghassan-bm-oiuan- bin-Suliman, who has almost unlimited power over his people. Hilal has an elder brother. Amir, who is not recognized as 'Temeeemeh on account of his mother being a foreigner. His grandfather bman was murdered by the Wahabee Sa'ad-bin-Mutlak at El-Bereymee. The Beni-boo-'Ali Occupies the eastern part of the district of Ja'alan in El-Sharkiyeh, their towns being Soor, Belad -Beni-boo-Ali and EI-A s I,kharel, Ihe tribe comprise both Bedouin and Had In, * i .e., settled in villages. f ormer being owners of consider able herds of camels and flocks of goats. The inhabitants of Soor and Ashkhareh of this tribe are chiefly mariners and traders while those in Ja'alan are cultivators of date groves and grain. Ihe Bern-boo-Ah are a branch of the great Ma'addic tribe, Beni Temam, and are a war- like independent race with a high reputation for courage and dash. Thouo-h still perhaps the most influential Ghaffiree tribe in Ll-Shaikiyeh, they do not now occupy the prominent position that was theirs before their reduction in 1821. By religion they are Wahabees, having been converted during the Nejdian invasion, and they have since been fol lowed by the Beni Kasid and other tribes. The Bern-boo- Ah are the only34 administration repoiit of the persian gulf political tribe iu 'Oman who have ever eome into contact with British troops on land. In the year 1820, in consequence of the murder of an inter preter attached to one of the Indian Navy vessels, and as a punishment for certain outrages committed by the tribe on wrecked ships, a force consisting of six guns and three hundred and eighty bayonets of Native infantry marched against them from Soor, in conjunction with a lar^e force of Arabs commanded by His Highness Seyyid Saeed in person. The battle which ensued resulted in the complete defeat of the British force on the 9th November 1820, all the guns being lost, and the major part of the force being cut to pieces. The survivors, one officer and about one hundred and fifty men, escaped to Muscat on camels after an eio-ht days' journey through El-Sharkryeh and the Semail Valley. The defeat was avenged in the next year by a large force under Sir Lionel Smith, who attacked the Beni-boo-'Ali on the 21st March, and inflicted terrible loss on them. A large portion of the tribe was cut up, their town and foit were destroyed, and a number of prisoners, including the Shaikh Mohammed-bin- Ali, were taken to Bombay. There they remained two years, when they were sent back with presents to their homes, a grant of money being subsequently made to enable them to rebuild Iheir houses and wells. r Ihis treatment has had the best effect, and the Beni- boo-'Ali Tribe is now one of the most friendly and well-disposed to the English of any in 'Oman. The tribe is divided into four Fakhooth or Septs as follows :— 1.—Beni Razeek. Beits. Al-Hamoodeh. Awlad Rua. Awlad 'Abdul Jebel. Awlad Rahab. Awlad H assan. Beits. El-Ghanabees. Beni Ibrahfm.

The 'Awdmir are Bedouins, and are dispersed along the border region of 'Oman and Dhahireh, where they roam the desert as far as Dhotar, 500 miles from Muscat. A numerous portion of the tribe, however, is settled and occupies a clump of twelve villages in 'Oman ^ar Nezwa. The names of these villages are Kunatein, .El-Hameydah, LI-Aki , El-Saleebeh, El-Haleed, Hamadheyeen, Shafaa, Ll-Seeah, Ll-Habl Ll- Hadeed, El-Kila'a, Sook El-Kadeeri and El-Kharmeh. The 'Awamir are of the Ma'addic stock, and claim to derive from 'Amir-bin-Sa'asa'a ,Vt they are now ranged in the Hindwi faction, in character they are reputed to be brave and warlike, but crafty, treachei- ous and predaceous. The more western portion is said to be very wild and their dialect so different that they would be hardly understood ot an 'Amiri settled in 'Oman. Their sub -divisions are numerous, and are not all known t 0 me - The following are the septs in 'Oman Proper. The 'Temeemeh of the tribe is Mohammed-bin-Seif, who lives at Kuriatein : Fakhooth.

A lar^e Hinawi tribe inhabiting the Kuryat district and Hailghaf, their chief villages are Mezara-Kuryat and Hail. _ The Battash bear a o-ood character and are peaceably disposed. Their occupations are date cultivation and trade, and they used in former times to breed horses tor the Indian market, for which the rich pasture grounds near Hail oliei considerable facilities. The Beni Battash are divided into nine Fakhooth as follow: Fakhooth. Wilad Faris. 'Wilad Ward. Wilad Salt. Wilad Malik. Wilad Hazam. Beni 'Amir. Wilad Jumah. Beni Dhakar. El-Naab. Shaikhs.

They are an unwarlike tribe chiefly engaged in cultivation, but many of them are wealthy traders and own bughlas. Numbers of this tribe have migrated to Zanzibar, where they have become men of substance and position. The Harth are said to be 'Adnani by descent, but are now ranged in the Hinawi faction. Their ' Temeemeh' is Shaikh Saleh- bin-Ali-bin-Nasir, El-Simree, who is one of the most remarkable men in 'Oman at the present day. He assisted the late Imam Seyyid 'Azzan in the government of Muscat, and being a fanatical Metowwa^ is an invet erate opponent of His Highness Seyyid Toorkee. He has spent most of his property in organizing coalitions of the tribes against Muscat, and still continues on the watch for an opportunity to oppose the present regime. There are five petty clans in clientship to the Harth, viz., El- Shebool, El-Dooka, El-Mowalik, Al-boo-Rashid and El-Nowafil. The Harth are divided into seventeen septs as follow:— Fakhooth. Awlad Harfeb. Masbabibeb. Hal Sinaf. El-Asireh. Metawabeb. El-Magbareb. Resbasbideh. El-Sakoor. El-Makadebeb. El-Sumrab. El-Kbanagereb. Awlad El-Hadree. Gbeyooth. El-Burwaneb. Ma'amir.

They bear a good na me in the country 'or bravery, but are not a very warlike tribe. From the prominence of then former leader. Khalf-el-Kuseyr, in the civil wars at the comraeiieenient o the 18th century, the Beni Hinah have since given their name to the Yemenite faction A descendant of Khalf is now the Temeemeh of the tribe His name is Hilal-bin-Zaheir, and he is noted as one of the most resolute and daring Shaikhs in 'Oman. He distinguished himself in the time of Seyyid Thoweynee, and though he has not come very promment- Tfo-ard o y f late years, he has still great influence. The sub-divisions are not known to me. E l- H ishm Is a tribe of Ja'alan, mustering about 700 fighting men and m league with the Beni-boo-'Ali and Bern Rasid They are all^settled and agricultural, and occupy six villages, viz., Kami , Seif, Hameydheh, IWweh, Boweyrid and Sabt. They command the road between El- Bediyeh and Rafsah, and are strong enough to close it at pleasure, ihe Wady Beni Khalid is also under their control, and they take taxes fiom the various petty tribes inhabiting it. These tribes are collectively stronger than the Hishm, but as they are disunited, the Hishm are able to retain their supremacy. The Hishm have always been supjpoiters of Seyyid Toorkee, and were at the capture of Muttrah from Seyyid Azaan in 1870. They are divided into twelve septs Beni 'Omar. El-Towayee. Awlad Naseer.

Their chief town is Soor and they extend westward along the shores of the Bahr-el- H a dree, nearly as far as the Kooria Mooria Islands ; pasturing immense herds of camels and flocks of goats. These islands, known in ancient times as the ' Insulakzenobii/' are supposed by some European authors to have derived their name from this tribe. The sea-faring portion of the Jenebeh possesses, besides many fishing boats, about 1U0 sea-o-oino- b ugh las, trading to Bombay, Zanzibar, and the Red and 8000^11^5' , e y are Professional slave runners, and as ' Soories/' tlie name by which they are generally known in the Arabian Sea, they bear as evil a reputation as any other people I am acquainted with. They are not averse also to a little piracy when occasion offers, and are constantly giving trouble in this respect. The Temeemeh of the tribe is Nasir who holds despotic power over them, and draws a considerable income from his taxations. He resides with a portion of the tribe in 'Oman near Nezwa. Ihere are four septs of the tribe, each sub-divided into many beits or houses, ihese septs are El-Jowair, El-Gheyalim, El-Arameh El- IVlarhjinPh ) E l- N a'eem. r.t 3 lai ? e .

There are several smaller tribes m cliency to the Na^eem. B eni TU sib. This clan inhabits Ja'alan, where it possesses one village, El-Wafee, which lies in a fertile valley, producing dates and other fruits, corn, &amp;c., in abundance. Being Ghaffirees they are in league with the Bern-boo A i and the Hishm, and intermarry with these tribes, but more rarely with the latter than the former. Their founder was 'Abdullah-bin-^ ahab, M- Rasibee, who was a companion of 'Ali-bin-'Ali Talib, and they were the first tribe in 'Oman to accept the doctrines of the Ibadhiyeh sect, which is now the prevailing religion in the country. They have since become bigoted Wahabees, and the conversion has been bitterly resented by the other 'Omanis, who now detest the Beni Rasib with an intensity exceeding their former respect and affection for them.

They occupy the fertile valleys of Jebel Akhdar in the centre of and their chief towns are Shereyzi, Seek, Nezwa, and Zikki. e elevation of Jebel Akhdar does not admit of the production ot the date tree but most of the European fruits thrive there luxuriantly, and it is in the cultivation of these fruits that the Beni Riyam are principally eno-ag-ed. The Beni Riyam appear to keep aloof from the other Arabs, and do not bear a pleasant reputation. Their eponymus is Nahkam-bin-Tobba-bin-Zaid, King of Hamdan, the builder of the idol temple on Jebel Atwa in Yemen—a famous resort of pilgrims before the Islam. Their Temeemeh is Nasir-bin-Suliman-bm-Nasir, who has unlimited control over his people. B eni R owaheh.

They occupy a tract about twenty-fiv? miles m length on the Batineh Coast, in which are the 'towns of Maladda. Tuieef, Tharraad, &amp;c. They are an unwarlike tribe and are little res pected by the Arabs, as they bear a character for iuhospitality and mean-spintedness. 1 J f , Tlie tribe is sported to be wealthy, possessing many hundred of thousands of date trees, and a good deal of land under grain cultiva tion. Ihey also own many trading and fishing boats. ^ In 1874 when Seyyid Ibrahim-bin-Kais rose in rebellion and maiched against Mesna ah, the Yal Sa'ad formed his chief supporters, and it was they who m the capture of that fort plundered and maltreated the Hindoo traders there. For this proceeding Seyyid Ibrahim was expelled from Mesna ah, which was razed to the ground, and the Yal fea ad were condemned to pay an indemnity of $15,000, but it was not untd a naval demonstration had taken place that the fine was recovered. The Shaikhs of Maladda are Mohammed, Mes'ood, and Hameyd-bin- Tharmad Mohammed, Salim, Jabir, and Seif-bin-Salim: o Ll-Ivhudhra, Rashid bin Hajir; of Tureef, Saloomeh-bin-Sabah.

Here he distin guished himself in ridding 'Oman of the Persian invaders, and on the death of the Imams Seif-bin-Sultan and Murid, Ahmed's great services caused him to be elected Imdm, and the government still continues in the hand of his successors. Two branches of the Imam Ahmed's descend ants have furnished rulers, and a table of them is annexed. Tables are also given of two other leading families. The principal Bedouin tribe of El-Sharkiyeh, occupying the shores of the Bahr El-Hadriyeh, extending almost as far as Dhofar. They are purely pastoral, and subsist on their herds of camels and flocks of sheep and goats. Their breed of camels is generally admitted to begone of the finest in Arabia. They are a warlike people with the usual Bedouin virtues and defects, always ready for a fight when there is a chance of plunder in view. They form a large component part in all coalitions of the eastern tribes, and supply camels to their camelless comrades of the ' Hadhr' tribes. One of their septs, the Gahafee, to which that troublesome scamp Hamood-bin-Sa'eed belongs, was originally the Bedouin portion of the Al-boo-Sa'eed tribe. It amalgamated with the Al-Waheebeh a long time back, being induced thereto probably by a similarity in taste for vagabondage. The last great Temeemeh of ^the Al-Waheebeh was Nasir-bin-'Ali, who died at a great age in 1866. The present Shaikhs are Mansoor-bin-Nasir, _ Sa'ad-bm-Sa'eed-bin-Nasir, Sultan-bin-Sa'eed-bin-Nasir, and Hameyd-bin-KhaUfeen-bm-'Ali, all of the Hal-boo Ghafeyleh.

N ote on the sect of I badhiyaii of ■' O man. T he sect is named after 'Abdallah-bin-Ibaclh, who flourished accord ing to some authorities about A.D. 685-705, and according to others A.D. 744-749. It may be included among-st the numerous Kharijite or schismatic sects of Islam, but in J Oman it may be said to have attained the importance of a national religion. It was in the year 657 A.D. that a large number of the Khalifah 'Ali's followers revolted against his authority, and these were described as ' Khawarij ' or heretics who had wandered from the fold of the true faith. A year later ^Ali attacked the Kharijites, who numbered 4,000, and nearly exterminated them, as nine only are said to have escaped. The story goes that two of these reached ''Oman, where they preached and spread the Kharijite doctriness Later, ^Abdallah-bin-Ibadh established a distinct sect, whose doctrines are based on the Kharijite schism. The most important distinguishing feature in the doctrine of the sect is with regard to the succession of the Khalifahs or Imams of Islam. Whilst the Sunnites or traditionists recognize the four successors of Mohammed, Abu Bekr, 'Omar, 'Othman, and Ali, as rightful Khalifahs or successors of the Prophet, and Imams of the Muslims; and the Shee'ah or 'dis tinctive' sect rejects all but Ali and his family; the Ibadhis, whilst accepting Abu Bekr and 'Omar, reject 'Othman and Ali, and regard them as heretics and usurpers. For the view of the Ibadhi is that !the Imamate is an office dependent on the will and election of the faithful, and not rightly held from hereditary succession.I It follows that this does not admit the absolute necessity for anTmam at all, and, as at present in 'Oman, the office may be allowed to remain vacant. As they assert their right to elect their Imams, so do they maintain their right to depose Imams who are guilty of transgressions. In 'Oman the Imams have been usually selected from amongst the a Yemen' tribes; and in the eyes of the religions, the election of an Imam would, as a matter of course, carry with it the tem poral sway. The adoption of the Wahhabee* and Sutmi doctrines by many in 'Oman is obviously calculated to render more difficult the combination of the spiritual and temporal power in any one hand, and for many years no attempt at the election of an Imam of the Ibadhi has been made. In the older days it appears that Imams were elected as ' Shari't Imam or ' Dafi'i.' The Shari Imam was one who on assuming office vowed to die rather than yield to the foes of the religion, or fly from them in battle. Those not so vowed were termed Dali'i. In the * {e.g.) Colonel Miles in the preceding paper mentions that the Beni-Rasib were the first tribe of 'Oman to accept the Ibadhi religion, and have since become bigoted Wah- » habees. f Shari, in primitive sense a seller, was. also applied to denote a Kharijite generally, pi. form ' Elshurat schismatics,' so applied because they said that they sold themselves for the sake of their belief, or for paradise. The term implies approval, and was some times employed by Ibadhi writers when referring to 'Omani troops.46 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL ' Keshf-ul-Ghummeh' it is stated that the Imam Mohammad-bin-Yezul- El-Kiudi, 'was elected* as a Dafi'i • C. 930-A.D. Imam, being incapacitated from elec- .tion as Shari on account of being in debt/^ which showed a proper con sideration for the creditors. The official residence of the Imams used to be either at Nezwa, Rostak, or Sohar^ at which towns only could they lead the Friday devotions. The commentary of the Koran used by the Ibadhis is that of Zemakshiri, who was of the Motezelite sect of Khawarij. There were from early times four sub-divisions of the Ibadhi sect, which were united in the time of Seyyid Sa'ecd-bin-Ahmed, El-Imam, by the influence of a priest, named Ja'ad-bin-Khamees, El-Kharusi.

He it was who withdrew from all the vari ous erring sects, such as* the Mo^tezeliyeh, the Kaderiyeh, the Sefatiyeb, the Jahmiyeh,t the Khawarij, Rowafidh,J and the ShPah. He was the first to expose their false doctrines and to nullify the banefulness of their heresies by convincing arguments and the clearest demonstration. He grew to manhood in the time of Ma^wiyah-bin-Abi Safyan, and lived to the time of 'Abd-el-Malek-bin-Marwan.§ to whom he wrote his celebrated epistles and exhortations on moral conduct. The origin of the sect is traced up to 'Abdallah-bin-el-'Abbass, and Abu-Sha/ Tha, Jabir-bin-Zeyd. It derives from the people of Nah- rawan,ll and Nakhileh, and from the survivors from the fields of Safm^f * The first three are properly included in the general term of Khawarij. t From Jahm-bin-Safwan.

Also from the accepted and well-approved Khalifehs Abu Bekr and ; Omar, the companions of the flight, and the Ansars, or co-adjutors, may God be pleased with them all. 'Abdallah-bin-Ibadhi confuted the several fallacies in the doctrines of the various heretical sects, which have been shown in a previous part of this work. He taught that faith (Iman) consists both in word and deed,t and in following the precepts of traditional law. Articles of belief. —In this religion there is no sanction excusing any shortcoming in respect of it; nor is it permitted falsely to avow it; nor to give way to the passions. For this religion requires that the paths of righteousness be followed, and also belief in the following, — In God and his Angels; in His Scriptures and Prophets; in Para dise and Hell; in His Promises and Warnings; in the Resurrection and the Judgment and the Last Day; in the messages brought by the Pro phets from their Lord. It is also necessary to believe that the Koran is the word of God sent down to His Apostle Mohammed ; that His rewards are unrivalled, as His punishments are unequalled, and that the mercies He vouchsafes are great, even as the trials He imposes are great. Also that God is the Creator of all things; there is none other than He; His promises are not broken, nor His threats unfulfilled, for His word is true. That all that has been revealed through Mohammed-bin- Abdallah is manifest truth. The Most High God: eyes perceive Him not, but He compre- hendeth the vision He is all-knowing, all-wise; the limits of the heavens contain Him not; He is God. There is none other God than He, the One, the Mighty; He is the Creator who maketh all things and giveth form thereto; who raiseth up and finally disposeth of all; life is His gift and He causeth to die; He is the living who dieth not, all-powerful; one and everlasting unbegotten and unbegetting; all- powerful to do that He willeth; imagination comprehendeth Him not, nor do created forms resemble Him; neither movement nor repose can be attributed to Him; all in earth and heaven is His, and that which is between; He knoweth all things before they exist; time changeth Him not; possessor of miglit, majesty and power; undying, without com peer, companion, or offspring; His word goeth forth and what He willeth is; praise be to Him in whose hand is power over all things to whom all things revert. * Where Ali encountered Ais'heb, f i .e., that what is confessed in words as right mast also be acted on.

This* consists in testifying- that there is but one God, without co-partner, that Mohammed was His servant and messenger sent to guide to the true religion, making it manifest to the people of all creeds regardless of the scoffs of the infidel. Since the religion was brought from God, it is manifest truth. No doubt nor uncertainty attaches to it. As to the coming hour, there is no doubt of that, nor that God will raise the dead from their graves. But Islam in its completeness requires the practice of the following observances :— R eligious O bservances. Firstly, —Prayer with its accompanying rites,f conditions^ and obligations, such as the necessary purifications and washings; observ ance of appointed times, selecting a pure place, and turning towards the Kibleh. Prayer must be offered with earnest intention, and any word or deed calculated to affect the perfection of the act must be avoided. It is needful to understand the essential principles of prayer, to discriminate between those forms prescibed for persons at home and those for journey ing. To know the observances for Friday according to the ordinances of the Almighty as laid down by his Apostle and the just ' Imams' who followed him. The believer should be acquainted with the forms of prayer for festivals, for the dead, and those to be repeated in times of trouble. Also the distinctions of voluntary and supererogatory prayers and the rest as enjoined by the Prophet. A lms. Secondly. —Alms§, the payment of zekat or legal alms from such property as the law ordains. The obligations regarding this must be understood, and the zekat paid to the proper parties where the Nisab,[| estate, reaches the full value, the proper proportion being paid from the flocks. The Zekat-el-Pitr also must be paid, that is a Sa'a^f measure from the consumption of each person.** The dole to be given to the proper persons among the poor. * The orthodox describe faith to consist in belief, (1st,) in God; (2nd,) His Angels; (3rd,) Scriptures; (4th,) Prophets; (5th,) resurrection; and (6th,) decrees. t viz., (1,) prayer; (2,) almsgiving; (3,) fasting; (4,) pilgrimage. X Conditions of prayer— 1. Members of the body must be free from impurity. 2. Garments must be clean. 3. A clean place is necessary. 4. Fixed times must be observed. 5. The face must be turned towards the Kibleh. _ § Alms are of two kinds, zekat or legal alms, and Sadakat or voluntary.

Thirdly. —Fasting-, which consists in keeping the fast of Ramadhan, with sobriety and abnegation, and in all things attending to what is laid down, and abstaining from all that is forbidden by God and His Prophet, with knowledge of the proper rites. P ilgrimage. Fourthly. —Pilgrimage to the holy house of God for those who are in a position to perform it* with the enjoined conditions, namely, abstaining from sin, tarrying on 'Arafat, visiting the temple, and making the circuit, and throwing the stones.f These rites must be accompanied by understanding of the obliga tions J and laws of the pilgrimage, such as making atonement for slaying of game§ or the cutting down of trees. R eligious P recepts and L aws. Generally it is necessary to observe the precepts of the Koran as to gifts to relations and parental piety, and acting righteously and avoiding evil. Also as to the Jehad or warring against infidels and rendering their dues to kinsfolk, way-farers, &amp;c. Instituted observances and civil laws must be attended to, including abstinence from the flesh of swine, from drinking of wine, or other intoxicating liquor; also abstain ing from food or apparel forbidden by the Koran. * * * * It is forbidden to wail, beat the face, rend the garments, or tear the hair, in grief. It is forbidden to make pilgrimage to the tomb of any save the Prophet. Women are forbidden to adorn themselves for any but their husbands, saving the wearing of a finger-ring and anointing the eyes witii collyrium. It is incumbent lo salute the faithful and return their salute. Silken clothes and gold are forbidden to men. In fine, the believer must avoid all that God has forbidden, whether mentioned or omitted. D octrine. It is essential to be free from the error of those who hold that good and evil are o'f God, and that all sins are capable of expiation.

These Az^rekeh also reject stoning for adultery, and the beating- of the drinker of intoxicating liquor, but allow attack on those who are inimical to their doctrines. These heresies must be avoided. The Ibadhis renounce the false teaching of those who hold that Muslims who commit mortal sins* are to be accounted neither as believers nor yet infidels, but in a middle state, and that God will punish this class of sinners otherwise than infidels are punished. The Ibadi sect oppose their false teaching, who say that God is not the author of their actions, but that they themselves originate them, and that God does not guide the believers, nor distinguish them by His guiding mercy; but that guidance to truth and wandering to error are alike optional, to choose which they will, and that God willeth not the actions of his servants, but that they are free to act in opposition to His will. These are the heresies of the Kadinyeh and Mo^tezeleh, and the like. It is heresy to assert that God compels His servants to acts of obedience or sin. It is also heresy to assert that God knoweth not all things before they happen, such are the tenets of the Jahrmyeh and the like, which must be avoided. It is needful to renounce and be clear of all who reject the Muslims and scoff at their religion. Also to renounce all who do not take the part of the Muslims f and who do not acknowledge the true ' Imam, w J or who fails to aid those who do the right whether laid down or not. The foregoing are the laws and ordinances handed down to us by the just, one from another. We do not impose our religion on children of perdition. We do not submit to the guidance of the worldly. We have not derived our belief from the foolish and ignorant. We have heard the Lord of mankind say in his perspicuous book ' All ye who believe fear God and be with the just. Take no part in the licentious, who work iniquity on earth and prosper not.' We follow the just, whose truth is known and whose justice is renowned ; who are of excellent conduct and knowledge ; the righteous, pious, and immaculate; excelling in wisdom and nobleness, in probity and integrity, in meekness and humility; who earnestly attend to religious duties and observances; who are in the odour of religious learning; who have made religion manifest to mankind, and cleansed it of the impure and handed it down from generation to generation. We have followed the right with truthfulness, and found it the most excel lent path. We announce salvation to those who follow the truth, and woe and ruin to those who swerve from it. To the latter we promise perdition and rejection on the day of judgment; and we seek direction of Al mighty God, and I ask forgiveness of Him, and repent of all my sins.

As regards Southern Persia, the year 1880 was an unfavorable one in a commercial point of view. Althoug-h the crops of 1879 had to a great extent failed, and con sumption of imported articles consequently decreased, large imports were maderesultmg in a glut of the markets. This, under any circumstances, would have affected the succeeding year's trade unfavorably, but the evil was greatly enhanced by the occurrence of a second year of drought, which still further restricted importation, as it was obvious that the mass of the population would, owing to the scanty harvest, have barely means to keep body and soul together, little or nothing to spend on clothing and household requirements other than food. Several circumstances, too, combined to raise the rates of carriage in 1880 the scarcity and dearness of fodder, purchase of a large number of mules tor the (government of India, employment of numbers by the Persian xovernment m Kurdistan, great mortality amongst the animals, especiallv donkeys, and so forth. This further impeded trade. Nevertheless, the actual operations were on the whole greater than might have been expected, and the customs receipts are said to have exceeded the expecta tions of the collectors. This fact will probablv turn out to be due to two causes: overdoing the trade generally,' and the spurious opera- t'ons of reckless adventurers, who take advantage of the peculiar facilities offered them, by the character of the people, and ' laches/'' or more, ot the administration, to run a course of losing trading, over- Miying and under-selling, to the detriment of legitimate trade. Some wea thy merchants are said to have, by such means, been driven to re inquish their business. Such unscrupulous dealing has its limit for int ividuals, but if the system is not checked, commerce will become critical. It was very fortunate For Southern Persia that India had surplus grain, as it was the large imports from that country which averted famine, and provided sufficient seed for the present year's sowings. As it was, a gieat deal of distress existed in many districts, and numbers emigrated to 13 us rah, &amp;c., or moved up-country from the coast districts. Unusually good rainfall in the autumn and winter relieved the apprehensions of a disastrous famine.

Jones, Price &amp; Co. to make Marseilles a port of call. It is also projected to start a line of French steamers from Mar seilles to the Persian Gulf and Busrah, which will at the outset be in connection with the Bombay and Persian Navigation Company. Large quantities of mother-o'-pearl shells continue to be sent to the London and French markets from Lingah, but the competition renders the traffic less remunerative than at first. There has been an introduction of tea from Java into Persia, which is said to find much favor. In former times Persia received tea through India from China, and supplied Russia. Later, owing to prohibitions, Russia commenced to supply Persia with tea brought overland from China into Russia. The Indian teas seems little known in Persia hitherto. Exports of cotton and other ordinary produce from Persia have decreased owing to drought. An exception is opium, the increased production of which in Persia has attracted attention. This production is highly profitable, as a rule, to the growers, and therefore popular amongst them. During the panic caused by the recent continued drought, a cry was raised by the populace in some towns against the cultivation of poppy, and in a few instances poppy fields were ploughed up and wheat sown instead. The gradual increase in this trade during the past ten years is shown in the following table of exportation from Bushire and Bunder Abbas:— Year. Cases.

These hooras or catamarans are often completely under water, but are said to be very safe (quite life-boats in fact), and can put to sea in extremely rough weather when most of the other boats could not live. Modes of fishing. —Fishing is carried on in the Gulf by nets (Arabic ( Leekh/ Persian, f Dam^), the c HidiV or ' Hadhrah^ (fishing stakes), ' Gargoor' (fishing basket), hook (Arabic ' Meedar/ Persian ' Kulah'), and lineand spears or harpoons (Arabic and Persian, Kavvar,).

The net is left stationary, and the fish cauo-ht collected either by day or night when the tide is out. This net is fished all the year round except when the cold is excessive. 'Goofa/a small shrimp net, shaped somewhat like a landing -net catches ' Rubiyan/ (Persian ' Maygoo') (shrimps). Shrimps are caught usually in March, April and May. The nets are weighted at the bottoms with stones, except the 'Saliyah' and ' Goofa/and floated with the 'TapooP or thick ends of the date palm branches.

It is made of date tree brancheSj split bamboos or twigs. A couple of large stones are put in the bottom of each f Gargoor/ and they are then sunk in deep water, generally five or six at a little distance from each other and connected together by a stout rope; the last one sunk has a rope and buoy attached. They are left for two or three days and then pulled up and the fish taken out. It is not necessary to put any bait inside the f Gargoor'; the fish either imagine there is something inside, or out of curiosity push their way in, and when one or two are in the rest follow like a herd of sheep. I am told sometimes these ' Gargoors' are taken up as full of fish as they can possibly hold. The fish usually caught are : ' Hamoor/ ' Khuboor/ ' Sang-i-Sar/ f Sha'am/ ' Humarrah/ f Nimmar/ f Sikilat' c Jesh/ &amp;c. ' Gargoors' are fished all the year round, but are most successful from June to December. ' Gar goors ' are made of different sizes from 2 feet to 7 or 8 feet in diameter. Hook and line. The hook and line is extensively used throughout the Gulf, and in spring and autumn is most successful. A boat with four men will sometimes catch ten or twelve Hasham maunds (1 Hasham maund is equal to 124 pounds) of fish in a day. The hooks used are obtained from India. The baits used are f Khathak' or ' Naghar' (a kind of cuttle-fish); ' Meyd' (Sardines); flesh of the c Goaf/ a favorite bait for c Umedhreys' or 'Shureedah'; sharks' liver for ' S obey tee'; ' Belaleedth' or ' Aweyd' (Persian ' Pershak') (king crab), and for small fish ( Dood/ a sea-worm dug out of the sand on the shore.

When sailing at a good pace trolling with the hook and line is also adopted. Two hooks are tied back to back, and little bits of red and white cloth are tied above the hooks. This mode of fishing is called ( Ba Zanah/ ' Kan'ad ' and ' Anfaloos' are thus caught. c Kawar/ spear or rather large (harpoon), about nine feet long with a ring in the centre, to which a stout string is attached.

It is much used by the fishermen of the islands and Arab Coast for catching f Hamas' and f Sheeroo ' (turtle), ' Dookhs' (porpoise), f Shimahi/ ' Khathak' (cuttle fish) and sharks and rays of various kinds. Curing fish. —The curing of fish is performed by the Gulf fisher men in a very rough and perfunctory manner, which might be much improved upon to their own advantage, as more carefully cured fish would bring a much better price in foreign markets. Three methods are adopted :— First. —The fish are simply dried in the sun. This mode is adopted with sharks and ' Metoot.' With the former the flesh is cut into strips and dried. f Metoot/ a kind of white-bait, is simply spread in the sun and left to dry. Second. —The fish are slit open down the back, roughly cleaned, the head being thi'own away, a small quantity of salt rubbed on them, and then thrown into a vessel containing brine, where they are left for a time, and then packed. '58 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL _ Third.—-The fish are treated as in the second process, but instead of being placed in brine they are packed dry and left for soie hours wt they are again taken up, washed in the sea, and spreiui to dry. Vben dry, they are packed for storing-or exportation. I he fish generally cured up the Gulf by the second or third processes are: Khabat, Halwa Sufeyd' (Pomfret), f Halwa Sivah ' ' wf' ' Kan'ad' (Seer fish), ' Khuhoor,' ' Umedhreys,' ' Hamarrah.' The price of these cured fish vanes at different places and also at the same place at different times.

The fishermen throughout the Gulf are mostly all Arabs, originally Arabs, or Arab speaking, so the names of the fish are almost all Arabic. A few fish have Persian names as well as Arabic, which I give as far as possible, as well as a few Persian named fishes, for which I have not been able to find the Arabic equivalent, pei'haps they have none. For assistance in compiling the following list and the information contained in it, I am very largely indebted to Lieutenant-Colonel Miles, Political Agent, Muscat, and also to Assistant Surgeon A. R. Hakeem, Bassidore. To the former I am indebted for most of the scientific names given or hazarded. I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to avoid mentioning the same fish more than once under a different name, but cannot vouch for complete success. The list must not be considered as complete, as there must be very many more species of fish in these waters which I have been unable to bring to book. Arabic scholars must not be surprised to find in names given as' Arabic the letters G and Ch, for in the Persian Gulf dialect of Arabic these letters are constantly used, Ch being employed instead of K, and G in place of the guttural K, for instance, though the proper name of a common fish is no doubt Kan'ad, yet even on the Arab side of the Gulf it is always called Chan^ad.

The numbers of boats are in some cases exact. I have estimated the men from four to six per boat according as small or large boats predominate in the several places. The numbers from Ras Mus- sendnn to Ras-d-Kadd have been given as a rough guess by Lieutenant- Lolonel Miles: — Piratp Coast from Ras Mussendim to Abuthabi — Boats 810 at 5 men per boat . .. 4,050 Abuthabi to Bahrain 99 400 at 4 99 99 • .. 1,600 Bahrain 99 250 at 5 99 99 • .. 1,250 Hadhrah fishers 400 Kateef to Koweit (incl.)

At Lingah, for instance, the large boats have to pay dollars 10 for the year, and each fisherman is charged two dollars in addition. On the Arab side there are no taxes on boats, but the fishermen supply their several Shaiks with fish when required. Fishing in the Gulf is a very hard, though tolerably remunerative, occupation, and the men engaged in it do not, as a rule, live long. It is said that it would be difficult to find a fisherman up the Gulf over fifty years of age. Ihe glare of the sun and exposure to the winds (which are often laden with sand) are very injurious to the eyes, and blindness is very common among fishermen after a certain age. I have been told, indeed, that in certain fishing hamlets more than one out of three men could not be tound with sound sight. r , ^ a fisherman can earn Rupees 20 per month, but up the n :i d0 r t . think 1 th ey earn more than ab out half that sum. Very often the boats and nets are not the property of the fishermen who use them, in which case a certain proportion of the fish caught goes to the owners of the boats and nets. This proportion is usually one-fifth to the owners of the boats and one-fifth to the owners of the nets, leaving three-fifths for division among the fishermen. 1I 111 ... USi RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGKNCY FOR 1880-81. 77 Quantity of fish caught in Gulf and on Muscat Coast. —The fisher men can give no idea of the amount of fish they actually catchy but assuming that fishermen all round earn on an average krans 20 each per month^ and that the fish sell, bad and good, at an average price of four maunds of 8 lbs. per kran, which I believe is a fair estimate, we would get for the weight of fish caught per annum by the 16,380 fisher men in the Gulf and on the Mekran Coast the seemingly large amount of tons 56,160. On the Batinah and Muscat Coast from Mussendim to Ras-el-Hadd according to this calculation the amount would bo almost double this quantity. Thus the total weight of fish caught in the fishing grounds herein noted would be about tons 160,000 per annum. This of course can only be accepted as a very rough estimate, but considering that a portion of the fish go to owners of boats and nets, not themselves fishermen, and thus do not reckon towards making up the earnings assumed to be made by the fishermen, it would appear not to be an overestimate. ii i wop tie o. % i who osc s to tie78 administration report of the persian gulf political APPENDIX B TO PART III.

The accompanying returns show the statistics of trade at Muscat during- the past year as far as they can be gathered, but their correctness is not to be relied on. They compare somewhat unfavorably with those of the preceding year, as, owing to the continued drought, the date harvest, the principal production of the country, was not so abundant In the export the chief falling off was in fruits, fish, and shark fins. In the imports rice, the principal article, shows considerable decrease, while grain, on the other hand, was more imported than the year before. In cotton cloth, too, the importations improved, but a large proportion of • these cottons now come from America. The superior quality of ' Merikanis ' is fully appreciated here, and they are driving the adulter ated Manchesters out of the market. Dates are exported from Muscat to America, India, Yemen, and Zanzibar, &amp;c., and the amount seems to be yearly increasing. ' The ports of Soor, Kuryat, and the Batinah also ship large quantities, and the quantity shown in these returns is probably less than half the actual quantity exported. During the winter of 1880-81, 'Oman was visited with severe storms of rain and hail, which have been exceedingly beneficial to the country, though the hail did a good deal of damage in some districts. For two years previously 'Oman had suffered greatly from want of rain, hardly an inch having been recorded in that period. The annual lease of the Muscat Custom-house has been sold to Sett Khatao Bhimjee for $ 95,000. M uscat, 'i (Sd.) S. B. M iles, Lieui.-CoL, 2he th May 1881. ) 11. B. M.'s Poltl.

The report is preceded by a copy of a letter sent by Ross to Sir Alfred Comyn Lyall, Secretary to the Government of India, dated 14 July 1881, which enclosed the submission of the original reports to the Government of India (folio 69).The report is divided up into a number of parts, as follows:1.
                           General Report, prepared by Ross (folios 70-82), which is divided a number of small reports, organised by region and subject, as follows: 1. ’Omán [Oman] or Muskat State; 2. Pirate Coast; 3. Islands of Bahrain; 4. Nejd, El-Hasá [Al-Hasa] and El-Katr [Qatar]; 5. Southern Persia, with subheadings for Arabistan, Fars, Bushire, Lingah [Bandar-e Lengeh] and Persian Beloochistan [Baluchistan]; and 6. Bassidore; naval; slave traffic; the observatory at Bushire; and the purchase of mules in Persia. Under the observatory report (folio 74) there is a handwritten pencil note (author unknown) which questions the underlined term ‘Samoom’ in the text, described as ‘a scorching northerly wind’. Three appendices follow the report: Appendix A comprises tabulated meteorological data from the Bushire observatory; Appendix B contains extracts from a report written by Captain Edward Durand, former Assistant Resident, on the men and internal politics of Fars; Appendix C is a genealogical table showing part of the Kájár [Qājār] royal family of Persia, indicating their present official appointments.2.
                           Administration Report of the Political Agency, Muscat, for the year 1879-80, prepared by Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel Barrett Miles, Her Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent and Consul in Muscat (folios 83-98), chiefly reporting on internal political affairs, with additional short reports on changes in British offical personnel and the slave trade. Two appendices follow the report: A. A note on the tribes of Oman, written by Miles, with tabulated data on the population, district and political affiliation of tribes, and separate sections dedicated to each main tribe, detailing their geographic location, character, and internal organisation. Appendix A also includes two genealogical tables, entitled ‘Seif bin Mohammed bin Saeed bin Mohammed bin Abdulla Âb Boo Saidi’ (folio 92) and ‘Khalfân bin Mohammad bin Abdulla el Wakeel Âb Boo Saidi’ (folio 93). Folio 94 is a note, inserted into the volume at a later, unspecified date, stating that a map, plan or sketch has been temporarily removed from the volume. Appendix B is a note, prepared by Ross, on the Ibadhiyah sect of Oman, with the translation of chapter 29 of “Keshf-ul-Ghummeh-El-Jama’l ’Akhbár-el-Ummeh” of the Shaikh Sirhán-bin-Sa’íd-el-’Alwai of Oman.3.
                           Report of trade in 1880, prepared by Ross (folios 98-175), comprising a summary of trade and the harvest in southern Persia, and imports and exports. Two appendices follow the report: Appendix A is a note on sea-fishing in the Persian Gulf, written by Lieutenant I. MacIvor, Assistant Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, giving details of the main fishing areas; times of year for sea-fishing; boats used in fishing; fishing methods; curing and preparation of fish; importance of turtles; and varieties of fish found in the Persian Gulf and at Muscat, with a tabulated list of fish, alongside their (transliterated) Arabic and Persian names; numbers of boats and men involved in fishing; and quantities of fish caught in the Gulf and at Muscat. Appendix B comprises tabulated trade statistics, indicating the quantity and values of imports and exports in the region, lists of goods traded, nationality and tonnage of trading vessels.4.
                           Trade at Muscat, prepared by Miles, dated 27 May 1881 (folios 176-85), incorporating a general overview of trade, followed by a number of appendices comprising tabulated statistics for the average tonnage of vessels entering and leaving Muscat, imports and exports, value and description of goods.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Qajar Dynasty (Family)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Fars</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Agriculture</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Meteorological data</topic></subject><subject><topic>fishing - Persian Gulf</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000358.0x000229#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
