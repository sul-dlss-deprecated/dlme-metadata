For convenience of reference abstracts of (1) the proposals of the War Cabinet Committee ; (2) the comments of Sir Percy Cox; and (3) those of the Government of India are printed below in parallel columns. (1) War Cabinet Committee. (2) Sir Percy Cox. (3) Governmeiit of India. 1. Occupied territorie.s to be 1. No comment, administered not by Government of India, but by I lis Majesty's Government. 2. Basra to remain perma nently under British administra tion : western and northern limits to be Nasiriyeh, Shatt-el-Hai, Kut, Bedrai. 3. Bagdad to bo an Arab state with local ruler or Government under British Protectorate in everything but name. No rela tions with Foreign Powers ; Con suls to be accredited to His Majesty's Government. •4. Behind Arab facade Bagdad to be administered as an Arab Province by indigenous agency and in accordance with existing laws and institutions as far as possible. In particular ;— (a) Irak Code not to be used but local judicial system maintained as regards both law and personnel, only sub stituting Arab for Turk ; S 356 40 6/17 2. Agrees. 1. Readily accept decision ; but India's share in the conquest of these territories, in which her interests, commercial, political, and religious, are already large, must be recognised. Any restric tion of free Indian immigration into Irak would cause bitter and legitimate resentment. Provision of a definite field for expansion elsewhere, preferably in East Africa, would tend to satisfy India and check undue flow into Irak ; but in any case, in view of Indian pilgrimage and trade interests, desirable to post nu officer of Go vernment of India to Basra and perhaps Bagdad to advise local administration on such questions. 2. No remarks. 3. Ruler not feasible as no outstanding personality to fill part. Proposes an Administrative Council presided over by High Commissioner, either one for each vilayat or a combined one for both vilayats. Combined Council would bring into true perspective diver gent interests of each vilayat, and would have unquestionable right to regulate, in accordance with needs of whole country, such questions as Indian immigration and cognate matters. 4. (a) Agrees that territory should be administered in accordance with existing laws and institutions, and con vinced of great advantage of having uniform codes for Basra and Bagdad and other Arab provinces under foreign rule or protection. No essen tial reason why systems established in both vilayats should not be assimilated. Turkish judicial system in cluded final reference to Constantinople, for which substitute muBt be found by creation of High Court of Mesopotamia with final appeal (a) No remarks. 3. Entirely agree with Sir P. Cox that precise constitution of Arab State at Bagdad under British Protectorate cannot be decided at once. Experience of puppet rulers in India and Afgh anistan not encouraging. Endorse Sir P. Cox's suggestion (under head 13) as to appointment of a Commission to examine whole problem on the spot. 4.(!) War Cabinet Committee. (2) Sir Percy Cox. (3) Government of India. (b) No remarks. (6) Similarly with executive and administrative machinery, tribal system of Government; provincial and local councils, &amp;c., to be resuscitated and maintained ; . (c) Present land revenue system not to be disturbed ; {d) Employment of Indians in any branch of administration to be strictly discountenanced as inconsistent with above principles, and no Asiatics from outside to be employed unless of Persian or Arab descent or doijiicile. The same to apply as far as pos sible to Basra vilayat.j 5. If Basra is not annexed, head of whole Mesopotamian ad ministration to be liiph Commis sioner residing at Bagdad. Basra being placed under a Governor subordinate to him. If Basra is annexed, head of administration to be styled Governor of Basra and High Commissioner for Meso potamia with titular headquarters at Basra, but residing generally at Bagdad. Deputy Governor and Deputy High Commissioner at Basra and Bagdad respectively to act for him in his absence. to Privy Council. Civil and criminal codes and land laws require considerable amend ment and adjustment of wording to make them inter- pretable. As regards personnel, sufficient indigenous material not available at present, but can gradually be created, (ft) Tribal system of govern ment already adopted where suitable ; no objection to pro vincial and local councils. (r) Agrees in principle. (d) Agrees; but for duration of war must have some latitude, especially in regard to clerical establishments. Urgent re quirements of Expeditionary Force and military admini stration must be met by most 1 expeditious means possible. 5. Recognises that both vilayats cannot be annexed, and that importance of annexing Basra makes it necessary to put up with certain disadvantages at Bagdad. Is convinced, however, that two administrations should be so similar as to be indistintruishable in the working. Difference would be one of technical ['olitical status and nomenclature not felt on the spot. Two vilayats from every point of view inseparable, and could not be run on conflicting lines and inconsistent principles without great prejudice to all interests concerned. 6. British Civil Service to be amalgamated with that of Soudan and possibly also of Levant, re cruitment being by same method and personnel interchangeable. British officers of Indian services, if required at first, to be lent temporarily under foreign service rules; those now serving there to be permitted to volunteer for per manent transfer. 6. No comment or objection. (c) No remarks. (c?) In practice impossible pro bably for some time to dis pense entirely with Indian Moslems in the administration. No wish to encourage introduc tion of Indian subordinates, but think it would be a grave mistake to debar them abso lutely. Such a course would excite legitimate ill-feeling in India. 5. No remarks. 6. No rt^Plferks. 7. Sliiah holy places to form a 7.

Quite prepared to meet indents if given full warning. If large irrigation works started at once in Mesopotamia, almost in evitable that labour should come from India. Control of large colonies of Indian labourers will present difficulties. Further, when large schemes have been earned out, good cultivators will be re- quired; do not see how they can be found without indenting upon India. For these reasons large schemes to be deprecated until the country settles down and local labour is available. H.

Is, however, strongly of opinion (in which Army Commander concurs) that formal introduction of above prin ciples in existing circumstances (i.e., with martial law in force and the military position still insecure) takes too much for granted, and makes demands upon local authorities which may be incompatible with military inter ests and freedom- of action of Array Commander. Nevertheless, accepts policy in principle, and 12. General remarks. —Subject to above remarks, readily accept general policy proposed; but fully endorse views of Sir P. Cox under heads 12 and 13. Pre sume (and strongly urge) that present practice of keeping Com mander-in-Chief in India informed of all developments in the military situation in Mesopotamia will be maintained. If kept in ignorance of policy, and merely treated as supplier of materials and per sonnel, no assurance that India's resources will be utilised and developed to best advantage. Same applies to Aden and other(1) War Cabiuet Conmiittee.

As regards conditions after the war, India will apparently be responsible for some time to come for supplying troops for defence i and garrisoning of Mesopotamia ; or at any rate for providing re serves for all military operations. Strongly urge, in view of these con siderations, that India be kept fully informed of all political develop ments which may necessitate a call for troops. Otherwise, con templated policy would, in fact, be giving prospective Government of Mesopotamia a blank cheque on India's military resources.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000295_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B257</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000295</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B257</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Mesopotamia Administration Committee'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1917/1917</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-09T09:14:53</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>2 folios</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation for this description commences at folio 130 and terminates at folio 131, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
