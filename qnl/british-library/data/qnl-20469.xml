[September 20.] CONFIDENTIAL. S ection 1. [39499] No. 1. Sir Edward Grey to Sir F. Bertie. gj r ^ Foreign Office, September 20, 1912. THE French Ambassador reminded Sir A. Nicolson on the 17th instant that some time ao-o he had enquired privately of his Excellency whether the French Government still desired to participate in the Bagdad-Bussorah section of the Bagdad Railway, as the Turkish Government were, he bad said, likely to be averse from agreeing to the mode of participation which His Majesty's Government had originally proposed, and perhaps His Majesty's Government might be inclined to abstain from insisting on participating themselves. . , ... The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, said M. Cambon, had been considering the question and had come to the conclusion that it would be desirable that France participate in the section above named, in order that Anglo-French co-operation should be maintained, and the section not be handed over to the Germans. Sir A. Nicolson told his Excellency that this intimation had arrived too late.^ His Maiesty's Government had waited for some time to ascertain the views of the French and Russian Governments, while the Turkish Government were continually pressing for a reply to their proposals. So long as the terminus of the section was at Bussorah ^ ^ the question as to who should construct the line was not of such importance^ to Great Britain as was the settlement of the Persian Gulf and other questions. In view ot the difficulty of ever inducing the Turkish Government to consent to a participation in the sense desired by His Majesty's Government, and also in face of the possibility of indisposing them, were His Majesty's Government ^ to continue to insist, towards a satisfactory settlement of other very important questions, it had been decided to abstain from demanding a participation, if certain conditions, which would safeguara British commercial interests, were conceded. _ # _ T , r j ^ i M Cambon asked what were those conditions, and Sir A. ISicolson replied that he was not at liberty to mention them, but if they were granted they would, so His Maiesty's Government thought, adequately and completely safeguard Great Britain troin any unfair differential treatment. This, of course, was on the assumption that the line ended at Bussorah ; were it to be prolonged further His Majesty's Government would have to consider other conditions. n ^ m i r M. Cambon asked whether Great Britain would admit the Turks handing over the concession to the Germans, and Sir A. Nicolson said that if the conditions for His Maiesty's Government had stipulated were accorded, and. if a settlement could be reached on all the questions, they should probably raise no difficulties on the point he had mentioned. The British proposals had been before the Turks for some weeks, but they had probably been too fully occupied with other matters to examine them thoroughly. aDi) &amp;c _ E. GREY.

On the receipt of your despatch No. 271 of the 24th June, I requested the Commercial Attache to this Embassy to endeavour to obtain a copy of the exact trace of the new section of the Bagdad Railway between Eregli and the Euphrates River. Mr. Weakley now states that, though his efforts in this direction have not yet been succesful, he has reason to believe that he will be able to obtain the document in course of time. Meanwhile, he informs me confidentially that he has had an opportunity of consulting the Engineer-in- Chief of the Bagdad Railway, who surveyed the line between Eregli and Aleppo, and is at present in charge of the work of construction of the railway through the Taurus, as to the accuracy of the trace shown in the new sections of the Kiepert map of Asia Minor, viz.:— Section C 4, Kaiserije. „ D 4, Adana. D 5, Haleb. The engineer, who is particularly anxious that it should not be known that he gives this Embassy any information, examined these maps very care fully and informed Mr. 'Weakley confidentially that the trace was quite accurately shown on them, and that it was evident that the maps had been compiled from surveys and data supplied to Kiepert by the Deutsche Bank. Mr. Weakley adds that the three tunnels now being pierced in the gorge of the Tchakit river are the— (1) Belamadik Tunnel of 1,800 metres in length. (2) Tashdeunmez Tunnel of 3,400 metres in length.

WITH reference to recent correspondence regarding a proposed combine of British, and foreign interests for the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to suggest, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the time has now come when the Turkish Government should be pressed for a reply to the British memorandum of the 18th July last regarding the Bagdad Railway and kindred matters. The Marquess of Crewe is not insensible of the objections to taking this step when the Turkish Government are already deeply involved in other embarrassments. But he observes that while they on their side have already asked the gratuitous assent of His Majesty's Government to the 4 per cent, increase in the customs duties, the activity of the Deutsche and National Banks in connection with the navigation of the rivers and the exploitation of oil-fields in Mesopotamia seems likely to alter the situation seriously to the detriment of British interests in those regions. E^algp apprehends that, if a settlement of the Bagdad Railway and other questions dealt with in the British memorandum is postponed until the war is over, the Turkish Government will Toe found more impracticable than ever in respect of its Asiatic possessions.

As regards No. 4, His Majesty's Government take occasion to remind the Sublime Porte that British rights in the Persian Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements concluded, and transmitted herewith to the Ottoman Government, but on the custom, consent, and long-established relations between the local chiefs and the Government of India. His Majesty's Government hope that in the communication of these agreements, together with the supplementary declarations which are hereby brought to the notice of the Ottoman Government, the Sublime Porte will see proof of His Majesty's Government's good-will and desire to facilitate the conclusion of the negotiations set forth in their above-mentioned memorandum.

There shall be a cessation of plunder and piracy by lands and sea on the part of the Arabs, who are parties to this contract, for ever. Article 2. If any individual of the people of the Arabs contracting shall attack any that pass by land or sea of any nation whatsoever, in the way of plunder and piracy and not of acknowledged war, he shall be accounted an enemy of all mankind and shall be held to have forfeited both life and goods. And acknowledged war is that which is proclaimed, avowed, and ordered by Government against Government; and the killing of men and taking of goods without proclamation, avowal, and the order of a Government is plunder and piracy. Article 3. The friendly (literally the pacificated) Arabs shall carry by land and sea a red flag, with or without letters in it, at their option, and this shall be in a border of white, the breadth of the white in the border being equal to the breadth of the red, as represented in the margin* (the whole forming the flag known in the British navy by the title of white-pierced red), this shall be the flag of the friendly Arabs, and they shall use it and no other. Article 4. The pacificated tribes shall all of them continue in their former relations, with the exception that they shall be at peace with the British Government, and shall not fight with each other, and the flag shall be a symbol of this only and of nothing further. Article 5. The vessels of the friendly Arabs shall all of them have in their possession a paper (register) signed with the signature of their chief, in which shall be the name of the vessel, its length, its breadth, and how many karahs it holds. _ And they shall also have in their possession another writing (port clearance) signed with the signature of their chief, in which shall be the name of the owner, the name of the nakhoda, the number of men, the number of arms, from whence sailed, at what time, and to what port bound. * Not reproduced.12 And if a British or other vessel meet them, they shall produce the register and the clearance. Article C. The friendly Arabs, if they choose, shall send an envoy to the British residency in the Persian Gulf with the necessary accompaniments, and he shall remain there for the transaction of their business with the residency; and the British Government, if it chooses, shall send an envoy also to them in like manner ; and the envoy shall add his signature to the signature of the chief in the paper (register) of their vessels, which contains the length of the vessel, its breadth, and tonnage; the signature of the envoy to be renewed every year. Also all such envoy shall be at the expense of their own party. Article 7. If any tribe or others shall not desist from plunder and piracy, the friendly Arabs shall act against them according to their ability and circumstances, and an arrangement for this purpose shall take place between the friendly Arabs and the British at the time when such plunder and piracy shall occur. Article 8. The putting men to death after they have given up their arms is an act of piracy and not of acknowledged war ; and if any tribe shall put to death any persons, either Mahommedans or others, after they have given up their arms, such tribe shall be held to have broken the peace ; and the friendly Arabs shall act against them in conjunction with the British, and, God willing, the war against them shall not cease until the surrender of those who performed the act and of those who ordered it. Article 9. The carrying off of slaves, men, women, or children from the coasts of Africa or elsewhere, and the transporting them in vessels, is plunder and piracy, and the friendly Arabs shall do nothing of this nature. Article 10. The vessels of the friendly Arabs, bearing their flag above described, shall enter into all the British ports and into the ports of the allies of the British so far as they shall be able to effect it; and they shall buy and sell therein, and if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of it.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Foreign Depart ment endorsement No. 2356-E. A.^ofthe 21st December 1911, and to recall the fact that Shaikh Mubarak was consulted by me on behalf of the Government of India regarding the proposal to communicate to the Porte the details of his engage- menta with us. 2, In these circumstances, I would ask Government to consider whether it is not now advisable for us to apprise the Shaikh of the action we have taken. If the Government of India generally agree that it is expedient to make some intimation to him, and to do so now, then I would ask them to consider the precise form of the communication which I am to make. There would seem to be three courses open to us:— (1) to inform the Shaikh that the terms of— (a) the agreement of 23rd January 1899 ; (&amp;) the arms agreement of 24th May 1900 ; (c) the postal agreement of the 24th February 1904, as per translations attached, have been communicated to the Porte who have been informed that His Majesty's Government hold, moreover, a lease of land from him,' 5 thus refraining from special mention of the omission to communicate a copy of Colonel Meade's supple mentary letter of 23rd January 1899, or the substitution for it of the observations contained in the second paragraph of Sir Edward Grey's communication to Tewfik Pasha, dated 24th October; (2) to include a quotation of these latter observations in our written communication; (3) to quote them verbally, simultaneously with the communication suggested in (1). 3, If the general negotiations with the Porte were likely soon to be brought to a conclusion, it might not be considered necessary to make any communication to Shaikh Mubarak at present, pending that development; but the danger is that he may conceivably learn details in the meanwhile from Turkish sources or be pressed for further information by the Basrah authorities, in which case he might presume that we had communicated to the Porte more than we had, and be led by want of precise details into making inconvenient disclosures. 4. I shall be taking an early opportunity to proceed to Kuwait to carry out the instructions of Government with regard to the presentation of the Shaikh's recent decoration, and it would be convenient to me to know the views and wishes of Government in ,the connection under reference before leaving.

They seem to think that they can meet us as regards the second section of the British Me morandum of July 29th 1911 except as to Qatar, where with- y drawal of Military post would be looked on by the Turkish Assembly as an unjustifiable surrender of Ottoman territory.

Board of Trade, (Commercial Department) Gwydyr house, Whitehall, London, S.W., 10th January 1912. C. 95. (1591) Immediate and Confidential. Sir, ibuliviUj I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter (No. 57043), with, its enclosures, relative to a proposal to replace the present ad valorem system of Customs duties in Turkey by a specific tariff, and also to a proposal that the Baghdad Hail way Company should be allowed to construct Customs buildings and exploit bonded warehouses at Baghdad and Basrah. In reply I am to say as regards the first proposal that the Board think that His Majesty's Government need not object in principle to the substitution of a specific for an ad, valorem tariff if all the other Powers concerned should be in agreement on the subject. Such a substitution might, conceivably, in some cases prove of advantage to British exporters who are sometimes subjected to unfair competition by exporters from other countries in the shape of fraudulent declarations of value. Any detailed proposals in this direction would of course have to be submitted to very careful scrutiny—not only as regards the valua tions but also as regards the classifications adopted—from the point of view of their probable effect on British interests. Particular attention would naturally have to be paid to the schedule of duties on cotton goods. The necessity of adopting a simple and intelligible classification of duties, which will reduce to a minimum the opportunities for Customs disputes, is also a matter of vital importance to trade. The fact that the proposed specific tariff is being elaborated by Sir R. Crawford affords some presumption that these matters will not be overlooked. I am to add that as soon as a copy of the draft tariff on which Sir R. Crawford has been engaged can be confidentially obtained, the Board will be prepared to examine it carefully from the above points of view. With reference, however, to that part of Sir R. Crawford's letter enclosed in your letter under reply, which suggests that such a tariff may be used in the forthcoming negotiations between Turkey and Austria Hungary, the Board presume that His Majesty's Government would only consent to take part in any negotiations for the imposition of a specific tariff as part of a general scheme for the conclusion of new commercial treaties by Turkey to which the new tariff would be scheduled. In the event of these treaties being denounced, the existing ad valorem tariff would of course automatically revive. In any new Anglo-Turkish treaty it might perhaps be desirable to stipulate for the periodical revision of the tariff as a consequence of changes in prices. As regards the other proposal, viz., for the construction of a Customs house and of bonded warehouses at Baghdad by the Baghdad Railway Company it appears premature to make any arrangements for this purpose until the Company which will work the line south of Baghdad has been formed Inasmuch as the lines south and north of Baghdad respectively will be forked by different companies, the Board would prefer that the construction of Customs buildings should be the joint undertaking of the two companies rather than that of the existing Baghdad Railway Company alone. As regards the proposed buildings24 at Easrah, on the other hand, it would seem more appropriate that the construction should be conceded to the proposed International Company. I have, etc., GEO. J. STANLEY. The Under-Secretary of State, Poreign Office. {Received on the oth February 1912 with Political Secretary's letter No. 3, dated the 19th January 1912.) (Telegram P.) S ir E. G rey to S ir G.

As the best course, the Turkish Government should be urged to send a reply to our memorandum of last July and you should express the hope that the Ottoman Ambassador will soon be authorised to send in a reply. Mean while, His Majesty s Consul at Basrah should be instructed by vou not to press the matter.

Any settlement with the Porte which does not provide for its retirement from Qatar will, to my mind, leave much to be de sired. Seeing that there is no material basis for their claim, surely the argument of the turks that their Parliament will regard a withdrawal as a cession of territory is begging the question: we have always challenged their claim and the small military detachment at A1 Bida has practically been imprisoned inside its own barrack, and no attempt has been made to exercise any jurisdiction. The position would not merely be left where it is if we were specifically to recognize the suzerainty of the Porte: the xurks would thereby be enabled £0 consolidate their posi tion both along the coast and in the hinterland the whole dis tance from the Southern boundary of Koweit to the Northern limits of Abu Dhabi,(see Lorimer's Gazetteer). There is no thing to prevent them, in pursuit of this object, from cons tructing a light stratagic line of railway from Busreh to Ras xanura, with a terminus there; such action would place them in a very strong position both as regards the Arab Ooast and as regards Central Arabia O can see nothing but prejudice to our interests from such a development.Abnormal significance has lately attached to the Qatar promontory generally and to A1 Bida in particu lar in connection with the Arms traffic, the fact being that the traffic has shifted into the Upper Gulf with Qatar as its erf # emporium owing to our operations on the Coast 'iint tf T na-tfi' Having regard to the lucrative nature of the trade and the venality of local officials no ttneaguraa whicii the Porte might promise4^ or to oaop. . lth . vle . to aoilllig iith the could be in the least relied on.

His Highness had seen an allusion to the Baghdad Railway having been touched upon in conversa tions at Berlin. His gov eminent sincerely hoped that His Majesty* s Government were not going to discuss this question with Germany. The Turkish Government had succeeded in obtaining the renunciation by Germany of the agreement of 1903 in so far as it affected the line between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf, only one condition having been imposed, viz., that no third power should participate to a greater degree in the capital required than Germany. i.s the Turkish Government were now engaged in discussions with us as to the ^ad-Gulf sections, they did not desire German intervention in these discussions, and they trusted we should not open the question with Germany as the latter power would only be too glad to re enter into the enterprise, or demand from Turkey some Jresh concessions in return for her aisESKfc abstention.

On receipt of that reply tney will give tne matter of how British interests can be most adequately represented their most careful conaide- r ation; but they can give no pledge whatever to the Ottoman Bank as to the financial arrangements which may be made.

He said that the railway could not reach Mosul in less than two years. Under the present conditions of transport it could not possibly be completed to Baghdad in four years. But negotiations are now go ing on with Lynch and the Nahriy6 and the Baghdad Railway Company for a fu sion ; each is to have a third share in the navigation of the Tigris; new boats will be put on; these will doubtless be built in England, as the contract for them is to be given to Lynch; the amalgamated companies wish to profit by Lynch's experience in this connection. Thus, the transport facilities will be increased and the progress of the Baghdad Railway correspondingly accelerated. Lynch, he said, was quite favourable to the scheme; he was doubtless afraid that if he did not become a party to it, some other arrangement would be arrived at for the transport of materials up the Tigris in which he would have no share at all.

Private. Please see your private telegram, dated the 20th instant. In my opinion Pnv settlement which tends to consolidate Turkey's position in the Gulf will leave much to be desiCi Hitherto our refusal to recognise in Katr the hcus standi of Turkey has prevented anv 'iuria diction being exercised and the small military post has practically been prisoners at El Bidaa' The Turks will be able to consolidate their position both in the hinterland from the limits of Kuwait down to Odeid, and on the coast by our specific recognition of their suzerainty in Katr. It will open up questions of joint intervention with us in Gulf affairs and will give Turks a foothold in the Gulf for the fifs't time with many potential possibilities. Whether it be in the protection of pearl fisheries, suppression of arms traffic, or the combined exercise of maritime supervision, I do not see how this can be reconciled with our interests. Serious preiudice to our interests in the Gulf is all that seems likely to result from such a development The irreducible minimum to our pledge is represented by the memorandum of 29th July, and I am not able to find anything which we can with safety surrender. If the present obstacle in discussion is formed owing merely to a dislike to the withdrawal of the garrison of El Bidaa, it might perhaps be possible to safeguard Turkish amour provre by permitting the present nominal garrison to remain on there, on condition that we are allowed to suppress the arms traffic there and that Turkish jurisdiction is not exercised in K i.tr outude El Bidaa.3 Confidential. , Ny.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the despatch No. 20 of the 18th January, in which you were so good as to forward to me copy of a letter from 13 C83FDthe Board of Trade, containing observations on some of the points raised m my despatch No. 922 of the 13th December last on the question of the results to our interests of a change of the trace of the Baghdad Kailway between Mosul and Bagh dad, bringing Khanikin on to the trunk line. The application of the German company for this alteration having been rejected by the Turkish Government these questions become of rather academic interest, but I desire nevertheless to ofier a few observations on the Board's letter. The Board were of opinion that the suggested change would not be detrimental to British interests because, among other reasons, if the Baghdad-Khanikm sec ion were built before the remainder of the line, British trade from the south would naturally be benefited. This is, of course, perfectly true, but it does not state the whole case. British trade would not be benefited any more than that of any other country—than that of Germany, for instance, and German trade would have the additional advantage of being carried by a German-managed railway, one ot whose cardinal principles is to further German interests m every possible manner. I am quite aware that German transit trade to Persia is at present msignihcant as compared with our own ; but we have to look to the future, and to the probabi i y that Germany, with its subsidised line of steamers to the Persian Gulf and its railway in Turkey and interest in the future railways system In Northern Persia, will, at no distant date, make a great effort to capture the markets of those regions^. The Germans, to use a homely phrase, play a very close game, and we cannot afford to give away' any points. I regret that the Board of Trade should have been led to think that I am under a misapprehension as to its views with regard to the possibility of discrimina tion against British goods on the German fines. My appreciation of their views has been chiefly formed from their letter to your department of the 7th April last, from which I gathered that they believed that such discrimination, at all events in the matter of tariffs, could be fairly effectively guarded against by a written agreement, and I merely meant in my despatch No. 922 above mentioned to convey that my knowledge of German railway management in this country did not allow me to place an equal amount of faith in the efficacy of such safeguards. The Board of Trade go on to say that they fail to see how the risk of discrimination would be increased, so far as the Baghdad-Khanikin route is concerned, if that route were served by a main line instead of a branch line. This point is, I may observe, answered by anticipation by the concluding sentences of the first paragraph of my despatch No. 922, where I drew attention to the possibility of a direct line from Baghdad to Khanikin being built by the contemplated international company Which is to undertake the Gulf-Baghdad section, an arrangement which would give us complete security for the transport of our merchandise from the Gulf to the Persian frontier. It is obvious that if the Germans had succeeded in obtaining the alteration of the trace this possibility would have disappeared. I have, etc., GEKAED LOWTHER.

Crawford is now being printed, and copies will be obtained as soon as they are available. Baghdad Customs and Bonded Warehouses. —By a long-established custoni sanctioned by the authorities, the breaking up of bales and cases of merchandise which arrive at Baghdad in transit for Persia takes place within the precincts of the Customs premises. The operations of breaking such bales and cases and converting them into packages of dimensions and weights suitable for animal transport takes place under Customs supervision, and merchants are further allowed to store such merchandise ■in certain rooms—for which a rent is charged—inside the Customs buildings until transport is available and the goods can be cleared for transit. It has long been recognised that the accommodation at the Bagt dad Customs for the warehousing of goods, whether for the local trade or for transit, is very limited, and demands have frequently been made by local merchants for an increase of covered space. The unsatisfactory state of the custom-houses at several ports—Baghdad included ■—was so far admitted by the Turkish Government that engagements were taken by the Porte in 1907, on the conclusion of the agreement, for the increase of the import duty from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, for the rebuilding or enlarging of the custom house premises at those ports. These engagements are being steadily carried out by the Customs Department; improvements in some of the ports have already been effected, whilst the work to be undertaken in others is being duly considered. A considerable amount of correspondence has been exchanged between the civil and customs authorities at Baghdad and the Central Administration in Constanti nople on the subject of the new premises to be put up at Baghdad, and, although a good deal of trouble has been taken, the administration has been unable to come to a decision in the matter, owing to the fact that the area occupied by the present buildings cannot be extended, and that no suitable site within the limits of the city, and having direct access to the river, has so far been found. In conversation recently with Sir R. Crawford on the subject I learnt that the customs authorities are much concerned about the present state of confusion which reigns at the Baghdad Customs, and which has been caused principally by the ac cumulation of goods destined for Persia. The disturbed state of the country over the Persian border has practically brought about a complete suspension of traffic bet ween Baghdad and Kermanshah. Goods for transit to Persia are lying in the stores of the Baghdad Customs, and the continual arrival of merchandise by river for Persia has so encumbered the custom-house space that Bash Mudir (chief customs officer) has been obliged to devise some temporary means for dealing with the situation. Al though, contrary to the regulations, this officer has, with the approval of the central office, authorised the temporary storage of goods arriving in transit in depots situat ed outside the customs boundary and in various parts of the town. These depots are hired by merchants, and are necessarily under Customs control, but this excep tional measure has thrown an extra amount of work on the customs officials, and they also incur responsibilities which the administration has every interest to see them relieved of.16 Recent advices received from Baghdad show that the available storage room in the town is small, and all has been secured ; much more is wanted, and, although the local agency of the Imperial Ottoman Bank is quite willing to erect temporary stores, no suitable site can be found within the town for putting up such buildings. The administration has been brought by a series of circumstances to face ohe difficult problem of reorganisation and construction at Baghdad, and this is now rendered more difficult of solution by the fact that the Baghdad Kailway Company are taking in hand the work of construction of the line from Baghdad northwards, and besides have in viaw the construction of the port. The new Customs buildings should be constructed close to the port and also be within easy reach of the railway terminus, and it is quite obvious that the Customs administration can take no steps until the railway company have fixed the site of the terminus and decided the position of the future port on the river. Even when these two points are settled, the question of the storage of goods has also to be solv ed, as the railway company not only have the right to construct the port of Baghdad, but by Articles 23 and 24 of the Convention of the 5th March, 1903, also have the right to build warehouses for the storage of goods. In view of these considerations and of the urgent necessity for coming to a prompt decision in order to place the customs service at Baghdad on a proper foot ing, the administration, rather than undertake the carrying out of an expensive scheme of construction, which will very probably involve an expenditure of some £ T. 130,000, would seem more inclined to arrive at some arrangement with the railway company. Negotiations have not, I understand, actually taken place; the administration has limited its action to making enquiries of the railway company as to the intentions of the company with regard to the port, railway terminus, and the stores, and the sites which those works are to occupy. Enquiries have also been made as to whether the railway company would be prepared to entertain pro posals for the building of the new custom-house, and I understand the company are favourably disposed to discuss matters with the administration and to make suit able arrangements. Matters appear to have reached this stage, and it is feared that, should further congestion take place in the Baghdad Customs, the administra tion will have no alternative but to come to terms with the railway company. In the concluding paragraph of their letter of the 10th ultimo the Board of Trade express the view that it appears premature to make any arrangements for the construction of the custom-house and bonded stores by the railway company until the company which will work the lines from Baghdad to Bussorah has been formed, and, further, that, as the lines north and south of Baghdad will be under different companies, it would be preferable that the construction of the cutoms buildings should be the joint undertaking of the two companies rather than that of the Baghdad Railway Company alone. The actual position of affairs at Baghdad is, however, such that it cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely ; some line of action must be adopted, and the hands of the administration may be forced at any time to come to some arrangement with the Baghdad Company. Although the Baghdad Railway Company have given up their concession for the construction and working of the Baghdad-Bussorah section, they still retain the exclusive right to build the port of Baghdad and to put up warehouses for the storage of goods, and it is conceivable that some arrangement for the erection and working of these and similar stores conjointly with the new company that is to construct the Baghdad-Bussorah section might be come to, were this company already formed. The subject of participation in the building of the port and ware houses might possibly be considered in the forthcoming discussions relative to the Bussorah section. February 24, 1912.

Sir, I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th February, transmitting copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople with regard to the effect upon British commercial interests of a suggested modification of the trace of the Baghdad Railway, and to offer the following observations thereon for Sir E. Grey's consideration :— 1. As by far the greater part of the transit trade from Baghdad into Persia by the Khanikin route is British or British-Indian, and is in classes of goods with which German trade in Persia does not seriously compete, the Board cannot doubt that the construction of a railway, replacing the present inadequate means of transport, would be of substantial benefit to British trade. That it would be 17 G83FDof advantage to such trade as can be done by other countries, and especially to German trade, is of course true, but unless the Baghdad Company, in working such a railway, adopted discrimination of a very pronounced character, the Board are disposed to think that the advantages resulting from the construction of the line would accrue chiefly to British trade, in view of its greater extent and wider local connections. Discrimination of a serious character would most probably be avoided by the company, as being likely to provoke diplomatic interven tion. an 2. As regards the possibility of guarding against discrimination by means of agreement between the railway companies operating to the north and south of Baghdad respectively, Sir Gerard Lowther refers in his despatch to an opine expressed by the Board of Trade in their letter of the 7th April 1911, to tk effect that equality of treatment *' could probably be attained without seriou? difficulty by an agreement.' I am to point out that their opinion related to the event of Great Britain having control to the extent of at least 50 per cent, of the southern railway, and that it was indicated in that letter that the case in which Great Britain would have only a smaller share of representation on the Southern Railway Company was totally different, and presented much greater difficulty. 3. Sir G. Lowther expresses the opinion that, so far as the Khanikin line is concerned, the contingency contemplated in the preceding paragraph might be avoided by the transference of the concession for that line to the proposed inter national company for the construction and operation,of the line between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf. On this I am to observe that the Board have no information which leads them to suppose that the Baghdad Kail way Company would consent to such a transference, since the Khanikin branch seems likely to be commer cially one of the most valuable parts of their undertaking ; and as, so far as they are aware. His Majesty's Government have never hitherto put forward any claim to the construction of such a line, or, indeed, with respect to any railway construc tion northward of Baghdad, the Board, on the information before them, doubt the practicability of their doing so at the present stage with any useful result. If, however. Sir Gerard Lowther is in possession of any information which leads him to think that it is reasonably possible to secure the transference suggest ed, the Board admit that a new situation is created, which appears to them to require that the whole question of British participation in the new international company should be examined afresh in the light of this new fact. 4. Subject to the last observation, the Board of Trade, as at present advised, see no reason to modify the views expressed in their previous letter, and they are relieved that the course of events has obviated any possibility of His Majesty's Government taking up a position with regard to the suggested modification which they consider would not have been to the best interests of British trade.

Sazonof's remark that the only argument m favour of the exclusion of Persia from participation in the Bagdad-Gulf section of the line, which has been proposed by the Turkish Government is that in that case Germany might be excluded from participation in the Trans-Persian Railway. I have to point out the admission of Russia to a share in that section, would not constitute a concession on the part of Germany, since that Power has renounced its rights over the section in return for ample compensation ; neither could Germany, for the same reason, claim to receive a share in the Trans-Persian Railway on account of Russian participation m the Gulf section of the Bagdad line. . .

(Private.) My dear Djevad Bey, Foreign Office, April 18, 1912. YOU asked me to let yon know privately, as soon as possible after we had received yonr reply, whether I thought the proposals of your Government were likely to prove acceptable. As you only communicated the reply on the 15th April, there has not been time to submit it to Sir E. Grey ; but I may tell you now, though purely as my own personal view, that I am greatly disappointed and, after what passed at our informal discussions, not a little surprised at the terms of your official reply. When contrasted with the terms of the British memorandum of last July, the Ottoman reply seems to show, on almost all the principal points, marked divergency, and I cannot conceal from you that I apprehend grave and insuperable objection to some of your proposals. I think that a very bad impression will be produced by the attempt which is made to whittle away the formal assurances which were given by the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs to our Ambassador in 1870 ; those assurances, though verbal, were repeatedly given, and were referred to in subsequent correspondence. I can show you the original signed despatches from our Ambassador at Constantinople. Then as to Koweit: I had been led to expect that, while the Ottoman Government might feel some reluctance to withdraw the military post from Bubiyan Island, the remaining proposals included in our memorandum of last July respecting Koweit furnished the basis of an agreement between the two countries. I must confess that a great stretch of the imagination appears necessary to reconcile the basis of agreement proposed in your reply with the determination of His Majesty's Government not to consent ' to any interference with the succession or with the internal administration, or any infringement of the complete autonomy of the Sheikh.' It may be that there are omissions from your reply. 1 am almost led to think so from your language about Koweit to me. You know how desirous I am that the negotiations should succeed ; yet I fail to discover the elements of conciliation, whether in regard to accepting our last proposals as to participation in the railway, or in regard to several other points. I am, &amp;c. ALWYN PARKER. [2435 s—1][This Docmnent is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's GoYemnient.1 [A-] ASIATIC TURKEY AxTO ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [April 24.] Section 1. [16000] No. 1. &gt; A Joint Minute hy Sir A. Ilirtzel and Mr. Parker on the Turhish Government's Memorandum communicated on April 15, 1912. 1. Bagdad Railway. (a.) Division of Share-capital in the Bagdad Bussorah Section. UTS Majesty's Government originally proposed, in July 1910, that British interests should be represented by 55 per cent, of the total share-capital. Turkey replied that she would prefer a distribution of 40 per cent, for herself, of 20 per cent, to Germany, 20 per cent, to France, and 20 per cent, to England. To this, in July 1911, His Majesty's Government made a counter-proposal that the distribution should be 20 per cent, each to Turkey, France, Germany, England, and Russia; the idea being to secure 60 per cent., or a majority, to the 3 Entente Powers : England, France, and Russia. Turkey now professes to fall in with the British view, by distributing the capital equally between herself, France, Germany, and England, in the proportion of 25 per cent, each, the Chairmanship and casting vote being reserved to Turkey! No mention is made of Russia; but, in our informal discussions, the Turks intimated that they would not willingly admit Russia, and that, if His Majesty's Government persisted, they would have to introduce another country, say Switzerland, to counterbalance her. The effect of giving 25 per cent, to each of four Powers, and allotting to Turkey a casting vote, would be to place control in the hands of the Turco-German group, in so far as control does actually depend on the percentage of capital held. Control probably does depend upon the voting rights of the various sections of shareholders in so far as the appointment of a manager' :1: ' and other high officials and similar matters are concerned. But though the control to be exercised by the Board of Directors will not be absolute (since it is proposed to fix by Convention the maximum and minimum scales of tariff rates and many details regarding transport facilities), and it is therefore possible to attach too great importance to the distribution of the share-capital as a means of control, we cannot recommend acceptance of the Turkish proposal, which we believe would be generally regarded as politically a defeat of His Majesty's Government, while financially the small amount of British capital that would find employment would cause great disappointment. Sir H. Babington-Smith has expressed his belief that Turkey, on the analogy of her holding in the Bagdad Railway, which is only 10 per cent., would be satisfied with a share of 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, in the Bagdad-Bussorah section, and he appears to have discussed the subject with the Turkish Ambassador in London. But we are led to think that his impression is erroneous; since the Turkish delegates represented to us that Turkey, as the territorial Power, was already making a great concession in limiting her share to the same amount as that of the other Powers participating and Djevad Bey has since forcibly expressed the same view in writing. Unless some via media can be found between the proposal of His Majesty's Government for five Powers, and the Turkish proposal for four Powers, a deadlock may be reached. _ ^ &lt; • • • tt- tvt • &gt; If, for political reasons, it is desired to retain Russian participation, nis Majesty s Government might perhaps reply that they cannot agree to the distribution suggested by Turkey (four Powers at 25 per cent, each) and that they therefore revert to the proposal made last July of 20 per cent, to each Power (Turkey, France, Germany, England, and Russia), but that they would be willing to agree to the President of the Company being a Turk. By this arrangement of a Turkish President, Turkey We might stipulate that the Manager should be British. [2435 oa—1] Bwould be in a position nominally superior to the foreign countries, and this would make the agreement more acceptable to the Ottoman Parliament. But we anticipate great reluctance on the part of Turkey to any arrangement admitting Russian participation. We have already expressed the view that the control to be exercised by the Board will be unusually circumscribed; bnt, such as it is, it will, in so far as it is to serve British interests, be dependent upon the continued solidarity of the Entente Powers. The proposal made by His Majesty's Government last July is based upon the assumption that, during the whole period of the concession—that is, for 99 years at least—the general policy of His Majesty's Government and the Governments of France and Bussia will be such as to insure concerted action on the railway Board, and it presupposes that the Governments concerned will be able to control the policy of their financiers, which in the case of France at least is more than doubtful. We venture to suggest that it may in future prove inconvenient that our interests should depend upon the co-operation of France and Russia , on the Board, since the necessity of insuring concerted action by the three Powers in Mesopotamia may handicap British policy in other quarters. Moreover, it must be remembered that Russian commercial interests are here contrary to our own, since the value of this section to us—at all events for many years to come—lies in the fact that it will enable us more easily to pour our goods into Western and Northern Persia where at present Russia is our only rival. We are accordingly far from being persuaded that it is in the interests of this country to insist upon Russian participation in the Bagdad-Bussorah section; and we venture to think that it would be better to provide for the Russian Government by participation in the Khanikin branch, to which, on terms, the German Government might assent, though the last-mentioned consideration applies to this course also. It must not be overlooked that Turkey is not altogether a free agent in regard to the distribution of capital, since the Bagdad Railway Company has reserved the right to a share equal to that obtained by any foreign country in the Bagdad- Bussorah sections. (b.) Proposed international convention providing for the exclusion of differential rates on any railways in Asiatic Turkey; for the alignment of the railway south of Bagdad, and the conditions under which it is to he constructed ; and for guaranteeing that the interest in the enterprise of the several parties concerned shall he of lasting duration and not subject to termination on the expiry of the Bagdad Railway Company's concession. No specific mention is made in the Turkish reply of the 'international convention' which His Majesty's Government desire, but we understood from the Turkish delegates that no objection would he raised to it. With regard to the exclusion of differential treatment, the Turkish Government declare themselves ready to assure to British commerce all facilities compatible with the agreements already concluded by Turkey with the Bagdad Railway Company. This limitation no doubt principally refers to the ' Cahier des Charges' or specification attached to the Bagrdad Railway Convention of 1903, and there is some force in the contention of the Turkish Government that their hands are tied so far as concerns rates on the Bagdad Railway. The specification is composed of technical details, and it would be well to ask the Board of Trade and Government of India to cause an expert examination of the schedule of rates to be made, so as to ascertain whether they are of a nature to serve or to militate against British-Indian trade. At first sight the Turkish reply on this point, the exclusion of differential rates seems satisfactory. Sir H. Babington-Smith has suggested that it is of great importance to provide that the facilities and rates on the Khanikin branch shall be the same for goods arriving from the Gulf as for those arriving from the Mediterranean. In this view we entirely agree. J The^ Turkish Government are ready to meet His Majesty's Government in regard to the alignment and the financial arrangements, subject to the arrangement of details. On the other hand, they say that they are not prepared to agree to the arrangement to be arrived at for the Bagdad-Bussorah sections being of lasting duration, instead of subject to termination on the expiry of the Bagdad Railway concession. This is a point of some importance; and we,do not think His Majesty's3 Government would be well advised to modify the attitude they have taken up on this question. In any case, if the principle of re-purchase by the Turkish Government £ 1 ® admitted, the exercise of such a right should be made subject to an undertaking that the present agreement in regard to the exclusion of differential treatment should not be departed from.* (c.) Pecuniary^ indemnity to be paid to the Bagdad Railway Company in respect of its renunciation of the right to construct the section of the railway between Bagdad and the Persian Gulf. The Turkish Government say that this charge must be borne by the proposed new company for the railway south of Bagdad. It was always supposed that this would be so ; and we cannot well object. Indeed, Sir H. Babington-Smith has pointed out that this is really Turkey's affair: Germany claims 2,000L for each kilometre abandoned by her; and Sir H. Babington-Smith has suggested that Turkey would do well to offer bonds of the face value of 2,0001 in place of cash, especially since the value of these bonds has fallen about 10 per cent, during the present war. (d.) Biver Dues. It seems equitable that Turkey should impose such dues for services rendered in dredging and such like operations in the Shatt-el-Arab; but we propose to discuss this point further in relation to the proposed riverain commission. (e.) Prolongation of the Railway from Bussorah to the Persian Gulf. His Majesty's Government proposed, and Turkey agrees, that the best terminus for the moment would be Bussorah. But His Majesty's Government further proposed that, in the event of the railway ever being prolonged to the Persian Gulf, it must be brought to Koweit under conditions to be settled by agreement between Great Britain and Turkey alone, and that a clause to this effect must be inserted now in &amp; convention dealing with these matters. Turkey replies that there is no present cause for contemplating a continuation of the railway beyond Bussorah, but that, nevertheless, the Turkish Government are prepared to give to Kis Majesty's Government all assurances necessary to disperse any anxieties which may be felt concerning the continuation in question. His Majesty's Government have every reason to insist upon a settlement of this question now, when they are negotiating for a general settlement, and possess the powerful lever of the customs increase. The Turkish delegates have represented that Turkey could not agree to the terminus of this Turkish line being under the control of either an Arab Sheikh or a foreign Power. The Turkish point of view is intelligible ; and it was partly owing to the difficulty of finding a satisfactory solution otherwise that His Majesty's Government suggested that the railway should stop at Bussorah. We think therefore that His Majesty's Government should maintain the view, in which the Turkish Government acquiesce, that the principal terminus should be at Bussorah, and that the prolongation to the Gulf should merely be regarded as a branch. But there is some danger that the Turkish Government might, if they could not secure arrangements satisfactory to them at Koweit, bring the Gulf branch to Um Kasr or elsewhere, and that the Sheikh of Koweit might deplore such a development. The Sheikh seemed gratified in 1907 when His Majesty's Government concluded the lease of the foreshore, as he interpreted the transaction as a clear indication that the terminus of the Bagdad Railway would be at Koweit, and consequently that the commercial wealth of the port would be increased. But we would not attach too great weight to this consideration provided that the Sheikh's position is secured. We accordingly think it important that the Turkish Government should be induced to bind themselves to bring the branch from Bussorah to the Gulf, if and when constructed, to Koweit under conditions to be settled at the time between Turkey and Great Britain; but that the position of Bussorah, as the real terminus. • * I understood them to say that if the Bagdad Railway Concession were extended, the other should be extended also. Could we not compromise on that ?—A. H. I agree. —A. P. [2435 a a —1] B 2should be emphasised, and that the continuation to Koweit should be characterised as a branch line in the further negotiations with Turkey. (f.) Proposed construction and control of the port at Bussorah hy the new railway company in the interests of the unrestricted commerce of all nations. Turkey ignores, in her reply, the question of the construction and control of the terminal port at Bussorah. The Turkish delegates did, however, intimate to us verbally that Turkey would agree to the construction of the port at Bussorah by the new company. They did not mention control; and probably such measures as police control would have to remain, as at present, in Turkish hands. But it is desirable that control of the port should be entrusted to the proposed riverain commission. 2.—Political and Territorial Questions. (See map annexed.) (a.) El Katr. Here there is complete divergency between the Turkish and the British point of view. The Turkish Government have maintained a post at El Bidaa for 40 years; and the Turkish Delegates have emphasised the difficulty there would be in reconciling parliamentary opinion to the abandonment of territory which Turkey has never formally renounced; and they represented that such a surrender would be particularly difficult to justify at a time when public opinion is smarting under the loss of Tripoli. They there fore urged that British interests might be reconciled with a consolidation of Turkish dominion in El Katr; but from this view the British Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India emphatically dissent. It appears to us that there is nothing in the Turkish agreement that would justify His Majesty's Government in abandoning one iota of the claims advanced in the memo randum of July 1911, seeing that an important object, in embarking on a settlement of Gulf questions was to eliminate the Turks from the peninsula. We consider that His Majesty's Government should protest energetically against the Turkish attempt to whittle away the assurances (see Annexe I) given by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, and repeatedly given, to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, and the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf; though Turkey did (in the person of Midhat Pasha) argue that there were no independent tribes in Nedjd. (b.) Bahrein. The Turkish reply on this point is, we think, fairly satisfactory. We understood from the Turkish delegates that Turkey is prepared to agree to Bahreinis having British Consular protection in Turkey, but not rights under the Capitulations, and this appears a reasonable attitude. (c). Zakhnuniyeh Island. According to the Turkish delegates this isle is connected at low tide with the mainland. It is^ however opposite a portion of the mainland which is south of Ojeir, the most southerly limit to which His Majesty's Government have ever recognised Turkish influence, and this attempt to establish themselves on the island seems to date only from 1909. (d.) Koweit. The Turkish reply evades a direct answer to much that was written in the British memorandum of July 1911. We consider that no useful purpose would be served by entering into a controversy as to past history, and that it would be expedient to reply to the Turkish Government that, while His Majesty's Government cannot accept or admit the justice of the Turkish contentions, they would be glad to learn whether the Turkish Government areprepared to accept the settlement suggested by His Majesty's Government last July, in the following paragraph :— British trade relations with the Sheikhs of Koweit have existed for upwards of two centuries and, inasmuch as the place has attracted merchants from all quarters by the equity of its rule and the freedom of its trade, His Majesty's Government could not consent to any interference with the succession or with the internal administration, or any infringement of the complete autonomy of the Sheikh. On the other hand, they are prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit, and to recjognise the Sheikh as a Turkish Kaimakam, provided in other respects the status quo is guaranteed, and the validity of certain agreements which the Sheikh has concluded with the British Government is recognised; provided the islands of Warba and Bubian are admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, and Turkish military posts are withdrawn ; and provided finally the Sheikh is admitted to the full and undisturbed enjoyment of any properties he may own or hereafter purchase on Turkish territory. Koweit would thus form a sort of enclave within, and forming part of, the Ottoman Empire, but enjoying complete self-governmemt under Turkish suzerainty. 1 As'regards the limits of Koweit it may be mentioned that in 1908 and again in 1910 the British agents toured over the whole of the country claimed by His Majesty's Government without finding traces of any influence there except that of the Sheikh. -But for the moment it is perhaps unnecessary to make any further reference to this subject, though unless the limits are eventually defined misunder standing is certain to arise. Meanwhile we consider that the Turkish Government should be informed that His Majesty's Government could not agree to conclude an arrangement with Turkey if the military post is maintained at Bubiyan Island; and we consider that it would be impracticable to transfer our agreements with the Sheikh in the manner suggested in the Turkish reply. (e.) Riverain Commission for the Shatt-el-Arab. Instead of the joint Commission proposed by His Majesty's Government, the Turkish Government suggest an Ottoman Commission, with a British engineer on it in the service of the Turkish Government, in order to avoid the appearance of internationalisation which it is their interest (and ours) to avoid. We understood from the delegates that the Commission would consist of two members only, and that the British representative would be in every respect equal to his Turkish colleague, and further that he would be free to correspond with the British Government as he pleased. Provided that his rights are secured by the Convention, and that it is also arranged that the two Governments shall agree as to the individual to be appointed, we think this may be accepted. But His Majesty's Government's further proposal that the executive engineer should be British should be insisted on. As soon as this Commission does any real work, the question of dues must come up, though so long as the expenditure is small, it may be possible to avoid it. But if the ownership of the Shatt is on other grounds adjudged to Turkey, the Turkish right to levy dues is undeniable, and if the dues are fixed by a Commission, constituted as proposed, its exercise seems harmless. The Turkish Government would undertake that there shall be no differential treatment of British shipping, and this should be embodied in the Convention. The Board of Trade might be asked to advise as to any other conditions that may be necessary. The Turkish delegates were anxious that it should be understood that all pilotage in the Shatt-el-Arab would be controlled by the Commission, and this may be agreed to. (f.) Pilotage, &amp;c., in the Gulf. This is not mentioned in the Turkish reply, and His Majesty's _ Government should repeat their claim to control it themselves. At the same time, it seems desirable to define the limits of territorial waters, on the basis of the Government of India's telegram of the 18th April, and a chart, on which they are clearly shown might form an annex to the Convention. It would be agreed that any of the existing British buoys, &amp;c., or of those about to be laid down by us, which might be found to be in Turkish waters, would pass with the control of the Riverain Commission. (g.) Policing of the Gulf. Turkey desires to carry this out jointly with Great Britain. It is evid^t from this proposal, and from the proposal that they should consolidate themselves on El Katr,a s well as from the general attitude of the Turkish delegates, that what the Turks are aiming at is, under the proposed settlement, not only to secure what they already , possess on sufferance, but also to obtain a footing which they have never had before. Now whatever may be said from the point of view of law, history, or policy, for the former aim, there is clearly no justification for the latter, and His Majesty's Govern ment, whose whole object is to get the Turks, as far as possible, out of the Gulf, can clearly, in no circumstances, acquiesce in it We submit that this should be made quite plain, and it might be well to remind the % Turks of Lord Lansdowne's statement in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that we should regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf, by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal.'

On the one hand Meissner Pasha seems anxious to phtain the cherpest and most efficient transport available, while M, Endruchs, the local representative of the Deutsche Bank, is endeavouring to attain the end in view solely 'by increasing the number of the Turkish steamers, in the ultimate hope of bringing the Turkish admi nistration under German influence or control. Lynch 1 s agent at Baghdad was in hopes of forming a special separate flotilla, for the carriage of material, to be owned partly by the Turks, partly by Messrs Lynch, and, perhaps, also partly b^ the railway company, the present fleets of the former remaining independent as before; but there seems great doubt as to whether such a combination could eve''' be estab j .led. The Deutsche Bank a,re evidently anxious to come to some arrangement with the-Turkish administration, while the Turkish Government are, ag far as I have been able to ascertain, altogether opposed to any arrangement being with Messrs Lynch for the carriage of the railway material. I have, etc. Sd/- Gerard Lowther.

Grey to state that he is desirous of calling together a corarnittee, composed of delegates from the India Office, Board of Trade and Foreign Office, to discuss various questions arising out of the Turkish reply, comunicated on April 15th, respecting the Bagdad Railway and cognate questions. The attitude which His Majesty 's frovemment can most expediently adopt with regard to the distribution of capital in the Bagdad- Bussorah line is a matter which principally calls for the early consideration of the three departments concerned. Another point, which concerns the India Office and the foreign Office, is the attitude of His Kajosty' Government in respect of the Peninsula of El Katr, In a Joint minute, dated April 84th. by ;3ir A. Hirtael and \ p? Under Secretary of State, India Office.(16000/X2) and Mr. Parker, the lollowlng paBaaije occurs:- 'It appears to us that there Is nothing In the Turkish argument that would Justify His Majesty's (rovernment in ahandoning one lota the claims ad- vaneod in the meraorandisn of July 1911, seeing that an iniportant object in embarking on a settlement of Gulf question^ was to eliminate the Turks from the peninsula*. Sir E. Grey recognises the cogency of thia conclu sion, which appears likely to coincide &lt;ith the v I oj/b of the British Rebident in the Persian Oijlf and the Government of India. But he is none the leas not fully convinced that the desires of the Turkish Government in regard to K1 Katr should, on account of the British interestB in volved, be negatived; he is not persuaded that a con solidation of Turkish influence in El Katr, if strict ly defined, is inconsistent with the maintenance of British interests direct or indirect; and he is diii- posed to think that there are irrportant and detiirable compensations in other quarters which might be procur able for concessions to Turkey here, and that such com pensations cannot otherwise be secured. As the Secretary of State for India is aware, the TurkishTurkish and Persian Oovemaants Bignod a protocol in neosraber 1911 agreainfr, in certain contingencios, to, refer tha Turco-Puraian frontiar dispute to the Magna Tritouruu. This agreement a-ius concluded tmdor the auspice8 of the British and Ruaaian Oovemmente. It appears to be generally held that if the dis pute is referred to this Tribunal, the frontier adjudi cated to Turkey in the Moharsmerah region is likely to be more favourable to her than the frontier as locally observed, and consequently less favourable to the stieikh of mohantaerah. It would, in view of the attitude of His Majesty's Tovernment during the Turco-Porsiun negotiations of 1911, be difficult for His Majesty's Government to decline to abide by an arbitral award; and, if that award were prejudicial to the Sheikh of Mohantierah, as indeed it might be even to the extant of the cliiiraa advanced by Dervish Pasha on behalf of Turkey in 1850, the resulting situation would be one of groat perplexity and difficulty. f ?uch being the uncertainty of the case, ir E.Orey is(16000/13) is (Uspoaad to think that every offort sTioulu he !a«ie to roach an agraamant on tho r -'ohfttirarah hountiary ivioe- tion hy iilract necotlation with Turkay; but he is not hopeful of the iasua of auch a negotiation unless Hie f.'wjauty's Oovemratmt can offer to Turkey a sub- Bteaitial quid aro .juo ilwwhMg, and, in his opinion, it might poaaibly be found in El Katr. British interoots in the peninsula appear to con sist principally in: (a) The raaintenane# of the grazing riojite of the Sheikh of R^hroin. (b) The supprasbion of the annti traffic. (c) The protection of tho poarl industry. (d) Hie exclusion of Turkish influence from Trueitil territory. Sir K.

Inclusion of the United States of America which has large trade interests at Busreh and Baghdad cannot logi cally be objected to by the xurks; and her point of view would be largely identical with ours as she Is specially interested in the traffic between those places.

(5), Prolongation to the Gulf of th3 Railway from Busreh. Kowiit was originally contemplated by us as the terminus simply because it had been definitely stated by the German GovernmentGovarmnsnt that this v/ao the terminus Jhioh they vantvd, (but as it haa now been deoided by the Porte that Duereh is to^^[ be the principal terminus and as it is no./ held that as com pared with Busreh i^oweit will never find favour v/ith the comineroial public, provided always that the Bar be dredged, we have no further active reason for regarding as essen tial the extension to the Gulf, .All that it is necessary for us to ensure is that if it is ever decided to be ne cessary to extend the line to the Gulf, the Gulf terminus must be at or in i^o'vait limits and no here else and that we must be predominant there. This at any rate is my idea of the present position md it folio vs that we should absolutely set our faces against extAision of the line to xUior Abdullah unless a site admitted to be in the territory of the Sheikh of K.c voit ba selected and Bubyan be definitely relinquished by the xurks.

I do not think that the feelings of the oheikh of Emr&amp;lt need be a matter of serious concern. He ./ould ex-, pect us if the line came to his territory to safeguard his interests. He would not greatly regret it if it did not. On the other hand a Turkish terminus in the khor Abdullah combined with the retention of Bubyan by the Turks would llsOwi, greatly be resented by typa*. ( d ). Qatar• In my opinion line advocated in the joint minute should ba adhered, to to the utmost. The Government of India &lt;S^ rare informed by me in April of the conditions on which I con sidered that the consolidation of Turkish jurisdiction in Qatar cOuld possibly be contemplated; but the questions of the frontier and the status quo in regard to Mohammorah had not «it that moment come into our discussions with the Turks. In regard to these questions it is my humble opi nionopinion that the Persian c ise 1 b better -on its merit a than tne Foreign Office at present appear to think and that vide my letter of May Slat wo....-85 - it i^ht be left to stand on those merits.

Firstly: N It does not appear to me that the concession proposed would be one ' in appearance only ', Bubyan and V /arba having been claimed specifically in our memorandum to be part of the sphere covered by guarantee their Elimination from its scope in the settlement arrived at vill be tantamount to resigning tnem to xurkey unless there is placed on record a much stronger safeguard than the mere 'title to our good offices in the event of unprovoked attack'. .Vith no better deterrent than that^the localities in question would be a constant fielfl for intrigue ou the part of local xurkish Authorities and source of anxiety both to ourselves and the Sheikh v /ho would certainly think that he had been treated witn bad faith. Wo adequate safeguard can be suggested by me less than categorical recorded stipulation that while the Town, harbour and immediate surroundings should be completol; autonomous the remainder of ivoweit territory to the extent attributed to it in Lorime^s Gazetteer (vide letter dated 9th May 1911 from Foreign Office to India Office) should be specifically recognised as being under the administrative influence of the Ghgikh of ^oweit and that Porte should agree neither to place military posts nor take any other action within it v/ithout the previous joint consent both of j the Sheikh and of ourselves. Secondly: a — it should, in my opinion, be possible t«% draft a Con vention by which Turkey confirms our agreements with ^oweit in terms which would not be objectionable and would do no n moremora than imply ultimate suzerainty; but more than thics is required by the Turita. They desire an instrument whjlch will 'replace' our agreements with ^oweit in terms whioh are com patible with tne 'sovereign rights of Surrey'. This is obviously out of the question. Thirdly: The presence of a uhinese Agent in the case of Thibet 'kkjCS-uZ. I was I understand a factor in the status quo ante^ In Kowait there has never been a Turkish Agent. &gt;e have expressed on the other hand our readiness to recognise the Gheikh of Ko~ wait as nominally 'a xurkish ivaimmakam' . He is therefore the xurkisn Agent and 1 hope the admission of any other can be resisted by us. (Cox).T^lG^ram To , Ho. 711 (P). I have roc-ivod from the Political Agent at Koweit cl ^ ^ 3-^ the following report — // / v --y A Baghdad Christian by name Alexander Forage in the service of Messrs Wonckhaus 4 Co., recently approached the Sheikli. After making reference to former request for appointment of a European A^ent reference was made by Forage to the Baghdad Railway and he enquired of the oheikh his views as to the ownership of Um Qasr which would, he said, probably become the terminus. In reply ownership of ^m Qasr was claimed by the Sheikh on grounds previously ad vanced and he added thatr if there ware any idea of its be ing used for this important purpose without his consent, he should at once assert hia rights in a forcible manner. ^ Sheikh claimed that his boundary included Jabal Sanarrv Safwan, Um Qasr, and thence to the sea. ^orage rejoined tlaat if Sheikh would lease or sell to the German Railway Company any part of his territory he could easily be assured of the possession of Gafwan, Ur: Qasr and Bubyan, as the Ger man iimperor was much interested and would soon arrange for the evacuation jof them by the Turks. He continued that a nai 1 &gt;/ ay site on the sea board was wanted by the/Ookpany who would give Sheikh his own price.for sale or for lease. It is claimed by the Sheikh that he closed the conversation by saying that borage's business appeared rather to be that of a diplomatic envoy than a plain merchan^t desiring to open a Trading agency. Political Agent in conclusion expresses the opinion that although the story may have been somewhat embellished by the Sheikh in order to enhance his own im portance there is no doubt that he has been approached more or less openly in German interests. 0 heikh has repeatedly said P.

India Office to Foreign Office.—{Received June 19.) Sir, India Office, June 18, 1912. IN continuation of my letter of the lOth instant, regarding the Bagdad Railway and connected questions, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram that has been received from the Government of India as to the possibility of making concessions to the Turkish Government in the Persian Gulf with a view to arriving at a settlement of outstanding questions. The Marquess of Crewe desires me to remark that in the proposals that have been put before the Turkish Government Great Britain is claiming nothing new, but is asking merely for the recognition of the position which she has built up for herself there. It is rather Turkey who desires to alter the status quo by the assertion of claims which she has never been, and is not now, in a position to enforce. This fact seems to put His Majesty's Government on strong ground morally for insisting upon full satisfaction, if so valuable a consideration as the increased customs duties is to be given in return. If it be urged that an equally satisfactory result could be secured by a convention strictly defining the spheres of the two countries in the Gulf, Lord Crewe has as little confidence as have the Government of India that the semi-independent local Turkish authorities would adhere to its provisions, or that the Porte would be able or willing to compel them to do so except under such constant diplomatic pressure as could not fail to disturb the relations of the two countries. The intrigues of the Turks with tribes on the British side of the demarcated frontier near Aden and the difficulty which His Majesty's Government have experienced in securing the elementary rights of British subjects at Bagdad are examples, and his Lordship fears that such a convention would merely perpetuate the state of things which it is desired to end. On the other hand, it must be recognised that the only alternative to a friendly settlement of these questions is the adoption of a much more resolute attitude in the Persian Gulf than His Majesty's Government have hitherto thought desirable. The nature of the measures which in certain eventualities it might be necessary to take are indicated in the Government of India's secret letter dated the 15th February last, copy of which was enclosed in my letter of the 7th March. With this alternative in mind. Lord Crewe concurs in the views expressed by the Government of India. NEGOTIATIONS regarding Bagdad Railway. See your telegram dated the 10th instant. ; We consider that our conditions as to El Katr contain no margin for surrender, representing as they do the irreducible minimum. As we have no confidence that any conditions imposed, however rigidly defined, will be adhered to by the^ Porte, we feel strongly the necessity of the complete removal from the peninsula of Turkish troops. No concession can be suggested by us that can be made with safety to interests of India and Great Britain, and rather than that any concession should be made to Turkey in the Gulf we would prefer to see negotiations broken off. Strenuous^ opposition should be offered in our interests to any step tending to consolidate Turkish position on Persian Gulf littoral. I am, &amp;c. R. RITCHIE. Enclosure in No. 1.

[Foreign Office despatch No. 226 of the 28th May, 1912, transmitting letter from the Board of Trade of the 24th May, 1912.] FROM enquiries made at the customs, it would appear that, beyond an exchange of views between the department and M. Hugenin,the director-general of the Anatolian and Bagdad Railways, no attempt has yet been made to enter into serious negotiations relative to the construction of the new customs premises and warehouses at Bagdad. The railway company have arranged to prepare plans of the proposed buildings, and, until these have been submitted to and examined by the administration, no further steps are likely to be taken for the present. ^ ^ . , It is not possible therefore, at the present moment, to define the basis on wnicn negotiations will take place ; I understand, however, that the customs are disposed to agree to hand over all the warehousing of goods—goods lor local consumption as 'well as those in transit—to the railway company, in accordance with the stipulations ot articles 23 and 24 of the Bagdad Railway Convention of the 5th March, 1903, but on the condition— 1. That goods intended for Bagdad are trausponed across the river to the town side by the railway company free of charge. „ -r 2. That goods shall enjoy free warehousing lor the fivst eight days after landing and storing. 3. That storage dues shall only be levied after that period. a 4. That the ' ardieh,' or progressive warehousing charge levied in customs depots, shall be abolished as far as Bagdad is concerned. The railway company apparently claim their right under article 24 of the convention, to erect and maintain bonded warehouses on any section of the railway ; the question seems to be a debatable one, and turns on the interpretation of the Turkish text of the article.

Whitehall, S. W., 25th April 1912. Sir, I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 17th April (No. 13396), forwarding copy of a letter from the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, Limited, relative to the formation of a Syndicate for the transport by river of material for the Baghdad Railway Company, and to offer the following observations thereon for Sir E. Grey's consideration. The Board gather that the operations of the new Syndicate are to be confined to the transport of railway material, or that if permission to carry general cargo be obtained it will be confined to downward cargo at rates not lower t^an those charged by the steamship companies operating on the Mesopotamian rivers. They also understand thafc there is no intention of incorporating in the new service that of the Euphrates and Tigris Company, which will continue as a separate undertaking; and that the new fleet will be removed from Turkish internal waters so soon as the construction of the railway is completed, unless some arrangement for its employment is then made with the Turkish Government. These points, however, are not all equally clear and the Board suggest that the Company should be asked to state definitely whether the foregoing actually represents the facts. In all the circumstances, and especially in view of the fact tha-t under Article 9 of their concession, the Baghdad ilailway Company are entitled to carry building and other materials, necessary for railway construction in V&gt; KAl *- J. KJ a. ^ ^ J %/ » __ _ • their own boats should they deem that course desirable, the Board are dis posed to think that if the foregoing summary is correct, His Majesty's Gov ernment need raise no objection to the general nature of the scheme, which would appear to secure for the United Kingdom a substantial share in this particular carrying trade, and in the construction of the necessary vessels. It does, however, appear to them desirable that an effort should be made to obtain from the Euphrates and Tigris Company an undertaking that they will not transfer the whole or any part of their interest in the new Company, or in the proposed Anglo-German-Turkish Company, without giving adequate (say six months') notice to His Majesty's Government, and that an intimation should be conveyed to the Company that His Majesty's Government reserve their right to take such action as they may consider necessary should any scheme be put forward for the utilisation of the new fleet in Mesopotamian internal waters after the railway from the North has reached Baghdad. The Euphrates and Tigris Company do not state under what flag the new vessels are to run, and I am to suggest'that, should Sir E. Grey see no objec tion, an enquiry might be addressed to them on this point. I have, &amp;c., H. Llewellyn-Smith,Telegram P., dated the !Oth (received 21st) May 1912.

It is feared by the Eoreign Office that a reference to the Hague Tribunal of the Turco-Persian frontier question might, since the Turks are reviving Dervish Pasha's extravagant claims, result in the loss of a considerable slice of the Shaikh's territory. It is therefore proposed by che Poreign Office to avoid the Hague hy including Mohammenh in the Gulf negotiations and by offering the Turks, in return for locally recognised frontier of Mohammerah, consolida tion in El Katr. The fears of the Hague award are, I am inclined to think, rather exaggerated, and that loss to Shaikh, if limited to territory west of mediating commissioner's line, is lesssr evil than consolidation of Turks in El Katr. I should be glad to have as soon as possible your remarks on the above considerations; your views on the latter subject are known to me. Telegram P., dated the 24th May 1912.

The inclu- sion of Mohammerah in Gulf negotiations we strongly deprecate and consider that possible loss under circumstances so obviously outside our control of small slice of territory by Shaikh would be infinitely preferable to concession to lurkey in J^i Katr. We also see no reason in order to evade the obligation of a weak casft going before the Hague Tribunal for sacrificing our own interests in the Persian Gulf.

He46 replied in the negative to my enquiry whether he had seen a telegram from Constantinople that had been published in the papers stating that proposals were being put forward by the Sublime Porte to give England, Prance, Germany and Turkey 25 % each in the Gulf section, and to eliminate Russia. He also asked whether I had any official confirmation of the matter. In reply I said that I was only curious to know His Excellency's opinion of the idea mentioned, and that I had no knowledge in regard to the Turkish counter-proposals. M. Sazonof was inclined to think that the acceptance of such a proposal would be a mistake, as the Triple Entente would be deprived of the predominant control of the Gulf section. The matter would, he said, require very careful consideration. In his opinion, therefore, the participation of Russia would be preferable. The only argument in favour of the Turkish idea was that Germany might be excluded from the Trans-Persian Railway if Russia were excluded from the Gulf section. Unless I question M. Sazonof officially I fear that I cannot extract a clearer exposition of his views. Please refer to my despatch No. 110. It will not be forgotten that in April 1911 this Government strongly advocated their participating in the Gulf section of the railway.

Sir, I have the honour to report that I received recently from His Majesty's Consul-General at Baghdad a telegram stating that he had received private47 information from a member of the Baghdad Railway staff that it was proposed to construct a railway for the carriage of railway material between Baghdad and Samarra, on the east side of the Tigris, and that there was talk of sending presently two engineer brigades to survey between Khanikin and Baghdad. From the enquiries which I have caused to be made I have been unable to obtain any confirmation of these reports. It seems hardly likely, moreover, that a railway should be built solely for the carriage of material. I have, &amp;c., Gerard Lowther.

Lowther to Sir Edward Grey — (Received 23rd April). Constantinople, Sir, 18th April 1912. In your despatch No. 114 of the 25th ultimo, you were good enough to ask my views as to whether, should an opportunity occur of obtaining from the Baghdad Railway Company the transfer to a British Company of the branch of the line from Sadije to Khanikin in return for some concession to Germany elsewhere, presumably outside the Turkish Empire, the Turkish Government would be likely to raise objections to such a transaction. I assume that the transfer here referred to would be not merely that of the Sadije-Khanikin branch as an isolated line, which would in itself hardly be a desirable acquisition to any British Company, but would be part of a larger scheme involving perhaps the eventual reversion to His Majesty's Government of whatever rights and privileges may have been secured under the Potsdam agreement to Germany for railway construction in Persia from Khanikin, in the event of the Russian Government failing to complete and link up their Persian lines with the Khanikin branch within five years after the completion- of the latter. Viewed in this light, though it is somewhat difficult at present perhaps to gauge what the Porte's attitude would be towards such a transaction which would be influenced by the political considerations of the moment, it is prob able that the Turkish Government might seize the opportunity to endeavour to obtain from us some political or financial advantage in return for an arrangement which, while in no way implying a loss to them, would be regard ed in the light of granting a favour to us. In any case any negotiations towards arrangement would have to be con cluded a trois. The Turkish Government would strongly resent any negotia tions being carried on between ourselves and the Germans without their knowledge. I have, &amp;c., Gerard Lowther.

We feel strondy the necessity for the removal altogether from the Peninsula of the Turkish troops, as we have no confidence that any conditions imposed, however rigidly defined, will be adhered to by the Turkish Government. No concession can be suggested by us that can be mads with safety to the interests of India and Great Britain and rather than make any concession in the Persian Gulf to the Turkish Government we would prefer to see the negotiations broken off.

While the anniversary of tlie Sultan's accession was being celebrated here by a military review, and by the opening of a new bridge across the Golden Horn, the occasion was marked at Adana by the inauguration by Djavid Bey, Minister of Public Works, in person, of the new section of the Baghdad railway line. The length of the section now opened between kilometre 328 and kilometre 468 is of 140 kilom. from Dorak to Mamouret. Of this distance 25 kilom. from Yenidje to Adana are covered by the Adana-Tarsus-Mersina line. The newly- opened section covers some of the richest territory in the Empire, starting from the southern slopes of the Taurus, and running right through the Adana plain to the foot of the Amanus range. Between the Konia-Boulgourlou-Oulu-Kishla section of some 240 kilom. in length, and this newly-opened stretch from Dorak to Mamouret, there lies the most difficult problem to be faced on the whole line, the 90 kilom. length of line required to traverse the Taurus ; of this 36 kilom. will consist entirely of tunnels, and at one point a tunnel will have to be bored extending for 2 kilom. in length. Work is, however, progressing rapidly, and it is expected that in a few months time 54 kilom. of this difficult portion of the line will be open for traffic. The crossing of the Amanus range also offers great engineering difficulties, but work is well advanced at this end, and by the end of the year some 150 kilom. more should be open, while the Osmanieh-Alexandretta branch line is to be complet ed in the course of next year.

His Majesty's Government are giving their careful attention to the import ant proposals contained in the memorandum communicated by his Highness the * April 24, 1912, Section 1.(Ts) Turldsli Ambassador on tlie 15tli April, and they trust to Le in a position to con tinue tlie negotiations with the Turkish Government when detailed investigations have been completed by the departments concerned. In the meantime, however, they are somewhat doubtful, from the terms of the Turkish memorandum, whether, leaving on one side for the moment the ter ritorial questions involved, the Turkish Government are prepared to accept the basis of settlement proposed by His Majesty's Government in the following para graph :— ' British trade relations with the Shaikhs df Kuwait have existed for upwards of two centuries and, inasmuch as the place has attracted merchants from all quarters by the equity of its rule and the freedom of its trade, (1) His Majesty's Government could not consent to any interference with the succession or with the internal administration, or any infringement of the complete autonomy of the Shaikh; (2) on the other hand, they are prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Kuwait, and to recognise the Shaikh as a Turkish Kaimakam; (3) provided in other respects'the status quo is guaranteed ; (4) and the validity of certain agree ments, which the Shaikh has concluded with the British Government, is recog nised ; * * * * (5) and provided finally the Shaikh is admitted to the full and undisturbed enjoyment of any properties he may own or hereafter purchase on Turkish territory; (6) Kuwait would thus form a sort of enclave within, and forming part of, the Ottoman Empire, but enjoying complete self-government under Turkish suzerainty. ' His Majesty's Government Would be glad to have an explicit reply with regard to each of the propositions enumerated above. There is another question which has recently caused some concern to His Majesty's Government, viz., that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah. When His Majesty's Government addressed their memo randum of last July to the Turkish Government that question had been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty's Government had no desire to raise it. But from the attitude of the Turkish frontier commissioners at Constantinople they are led to apprehend that the Turkish Government may contemplate advancing claims, which would inevitably re-act unfavourably upon the adjustment of the respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf, in view of the close relations existing between His Majesty's Government and the Shaikh of Mohammerah.

' Germany has, in her agreement renouncing her right to build the line between Baghdad and the Gulf, stipulated that the Bagdad Railway Company shall have 55a share in the surrendered portion of the line (Bagdad to the Gulf ) equal to that of any other foreign country. As matters stand, therefore, there are only two ways of keeping Germany out of the Basrah-Kuwait line, if it is built. The first way is that Turkey should build the line entirely herself, which would be unacceptable to us ; the second is that Turkey should buy Germany out of the Kuwait branch. The second alternative is preferable, and when we reply to Turkey it will probably be necessary to say that we cannot agree to any arrangement which does not provide for this. Germany may, as a keen bargainer, suggest that we should buy her out in return for some concession elsewhere. Our answer might be that this is a matter for Turkey to arrange with Germany, as the concession would be to her and not to us. A. P. Foreign Office, May 11,1912.

Constantinople, May 13, 1912, Sir, With reference to your despatch No. 99 of the 1 2th March last, on the subject of the proposed construction of new buildings at the Bagdad custom-house, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a letter which I have just received from Sir R. Crawford informing me that all possible measures have been taken for the temporary relief of the existing situation in Bagdad, but that they have been un availing to meet the congestion, and that there is now no alternative but to proceed, without further delay, with the construction of new depots. Negotiations are now in progress for the erection of the new customs buildings on a site situated in con venient proximity to that selected for the railway station and port to be built by the Bagdad Railway Company. It appears that there has been some friction between the Vali of Bagdad and the company relative to the choice of a site for the future terminus of the railway. The Vali insisted upon the station and port being built on the left bank, i.e., the town side of the river; whilst the railway engineers were of opinion that the right bank offered the best advantages for the full development of what will become an important railway centre. The views of the railway company and their engineers have now been adopted both by the Public Works Department and the Ministry of War ; all the plans have been made and approved of by the department, and the customs administration are now in a position to consider the measures which must be taken to put an end to the disorder which reigns at the Bagdad customs, and to relieve the congestion caused by the accumulation of goods intended for transit. In the negotiations for the erection of the customs' premises near the railway terminus on the right bank of the river, which are now proceeding between the customs and the railway company, I understand the customs are anxious to ensure the removal of the customs premises to the other side of the river, and therefore away from thetown and its business quarter, will not alter the present conditions of clearance of goods from the customs into the town, or expose merchants to expenses not entailed so far ; endeavours are consequently being made in the negotiations to secure the easy transport by the railway company of goods from the right bank to the town on the opposite side free of all charges. Should this point be satis factorily settled, an agreement may be expected very shortly. I have, etc., GERAED LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Sir it. Crawford to Sir G. Lowther. E xcellency, Constantinople, May 7, 1912. I am directed by the Administration generale des Contributions indirectes to advert to your Excellency's note of the 28th ultimo, and to state that the question of the congestion of the Bagdad customs to which reference is made in the extract from the despatch of the British consul-general, has received the serious considera tion of this administration. Steps have already been taken to increase the number of the employes in the custom-house, but the reports in the hands of the administration indicate that no real improvement can be effected until additional warehousing accommodation can be provided. Efforts have been made to acquire temporary premises pending the construction of the new customs buildings, and the Bach Mudir has, with the autho risation of the administration, already established a number of temporary depots in various parts of the town. It appears, however, that it is impracticable to make further extensions in this direction as no suitable premises are now to be found, and in a recent report the Bach Mudir states that the only course available effectively to meet the congestion (which has been aggravated by the interruption of the transit traffic with Persia) is to proceed without further delay with the construc tion of new depots. The building of these new depots has been delayed, as Mr. Lorimer points out, until a decision had been taken as to the location of the railway station and the port to be built by the Bagdad Railway Company. But the site for these premises has now been definitely fixed on the right bank of the river, and negotiations are in progress for the erection of the new customs buildings in proximity to this site, provided that suitable arrangements can be made for the easy transport of the goods without breaking bulk from the right bank to the left bank on which the town of Bagdad is situated.

[20863] No - 1 - Joint letter addressed to Sir E. Grey. g TE Foreign Office, May 15,1912. W e have the honour to submit the draft of an Anglo-Turkish Convention for the future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. C248FDIn view of the history and wording of article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), we consider that the Turkish claim to the ownership of the whole water way is so strong that it cannot successfully be disputed, especially before The Hague Tribunal; we are further of opinion that no practical advantage would be se cured by Persian representation. The draft is accordingly based on the assumption that the proposed riverain commission will be nominally Turkish and not international. But while invest ing the commission with a Turkish faqade, we have sought to further the general interests of navigation by placing the police control and supervision of the techni cal work in the hands of a commission, which is independent of the local authorities and only responsible to the Central Government, and thereby to ensure that the administration of the river shall be impartial and effective. We have also, by the wording of article 16 of the convention, sought to protect the property of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on the left bank of the river. As the quarantine arrangements at Basrah are at present under the control of the Board of Health at Constantinople, it has not appeared advisable, or in deed possible, to give the riverain commission any control of quarantine in the Shatt-el-Arab. As regards the levy of dues, it is not impossible that it may be objected to by other Powers as an infringement of their rights under the Capitulations, and neither the commission nor the Turkish'Government has the power to enforce payment. But in so far as such dues will be in respect of pilotage and wharf accommodation, they will be levied in return for services which can be withheld if they are not paid, and any difficulty might be avoided, or at least mitigated, by a consolidated due which could be pitched sufficiently high to cover all costs but in which the various items were not differentiated. Under article 23 of the convention of March 1903, the Bagdad Railway Company held certain rights in regard to the port of Basrah, which have devolved under the agreement of 1911 upon the proposed new Turkish Company. These are provided for in clause 6 (c) of the draft convention, and the relations of the riverain commission to this company will be a matter for negotiation when the company is formed. By handing over to the commission, as proposed in article 6 (g), the lights and buoys m the approaches to the river, His Majesty's Government will be saved the cost of their maintenance, which will be a substantial sum. We have added, at the conclusion of the draft convention, an article specifv- mg twenty years as the period of its duration. We have thought that this would be better than attempting to render the convention permanent or indefinite in its duration. It will be impossible for the commission to carry out any substantial works for the improvement of the river unless it is certain to last for a reasonablv long period, and, on the other hand, if a definite period of years is specified as the duratKm of the convention, it will be easier to withstand attempts on the part of the Sublime Porte to re-open thh whole matter and negotiate a new convention. We think it may be found desirable that the period for which the increased customs are to be levied should be limited to the same number of years. We have, etc., EDMOND J. W. SLADE. A, HIETZEL. C. J.

The Imperial Ottoman Government will establish a Commission in which shall be vested the control of the Shatt-el-Arab from Kurna to the sea. 3. The Commission shall consist of two members only, to be appointed by the Imperial Ottoman Government. One of these two members shall be of Bri tish nationality, and shall be selected from candidates suggested by the Govern ment of His Britannic Majesty. 4. Each of the Commissioners shall receive annually a salary of £T. 2,000 free of all deductions. These salaries shall be paid out of the receipts* of the Commission. 5. The Commission shall appoint such officers and employees as may be necessary, but the Chief Engineer shall be of British nationality. The salaries of such officers and employees shall be fixed and paid by the Commission. 6. The Commission shall be charged with the following duties (a.) The execution of such works as may be necessary, and as the funds at its disposal will allow, for the improvement of the channel of the river and of the approaches thereto on the seaward side. (b.) The provision of such wharfs, quays, docks, jetties, and other facilities as may be required for the traffic of the river. (c.) The control, so far as may be necessary, for carrying out the purposes of this convention, and 'subject to the treaty rights of foreign Powers, of the wharfs, quays, docks, and jetties, in or on the banks of the river belonging to private persons. {d.) The maintenance of the channel of the river free from obstructions of all sorts, so as to keep it in the best possible state for navigation. (e.) The preparation, issue, and enforcement of regulations for the naviga tion of the river and for the policing of the river and the land and buildings held by the Commission. (/.) The control of pilotage. {g.) The buoying and lighting of the channel, and the maintenance and control of such lights and buoys in the approaches to the river as may be placed: under the charge of the Commission. 7. The Imperial Ottoman Government undertakes to facilitate the acquisi tion by the Commission of such land, as the Commission shall consider necessary, to enable it to carry out effectually the duties assigned to it. The cost of such land shall be paid by the Commission. In cases where land to which fishing rights are attached is acquired by the Commission, no unnecessary interference with such fishing rights shall take place. 8. In order to cover the expenses of the works undertaken and the services maintained by it, the Commission shall, subject to the principles laid down in article 9, levy upon all ships such dues as may be prescribed by it from time to time. 9. No dues or taxes shall be levied, either by the Porte or by the Commission, on ships or goods on the Shatt-el-Arab based on the mere fact of navigation. The dues levied by the Commission shall not exceed the amounts reasonably required for the works undertaken and the services maintained by it. These dues shall be levied impartially, and no differentiation shall be made between the ships or goods of different nations or persons.10. Any sums which it may become necessary for the -Commission to borrow for the purpose of carrying out the duties imposed upon it shall be ad vanced by the high contracting parties at a rate of interest not exceeding 5 per cent, per annum, in such proportions and upon such terms as to repayment as they may arrange. 11. The control of all funds raised and expended by the Commission shall be vested exclusively in the Commission. 12. The Commission shall publish annually complete and accurate accounts^ showing the amounts received and expended by it. 13. If the receipts of the Commission are insufficient to cover its expenditure the deficit shall be made good by the Imperial Ottoman Government. 14. In the event of the members of the Commission being unable to agree as to whether any particular works are or are not necessary for the improve ment of the Shatt-el-Arab, or as to the way in which particular works should be carried out, the question shall be referred by them to an engineer of reputej to be agreed upon by the commissioners, or, failing agreement, to be nominated by the president of the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, and the decision of such engineer shall be adopted by the Commission. 15. The Commission shall correspond upon all matters connected with the duties entrusted to it with the Ministry of Public Works at Constantinople direct, and not through the local authorities. 16. The local authorities shall not interfere in any way with the houses, buildings, land, oi other property of the Commission, or with its funds, or with the discharge of jfcheir duties by the officers of by the police, pilotage, or other services maintained by the Commission, or with wharfs, jetties, docks, or quays in or on the banks of the river belonging to private persons. 17. The transfer to the Commission of any buoys or lights in the approach es to the Shatt-el-Arab shall not be deemed to affect/ the territorial juris diction in the waters where such buoys or lights are placed, or be made a ground on the part of the^ Imperial Ottoman Government for claiming that such waters are within its territorial jurisdiction. 18. The Imperial Ottoman Government will offer no objection to the contin uance of the custom whereby the war-ships of His Britannic Majesty freely ascend the Shatt-el-Arab as far as Kurna. 19 This agreement is made for a period of twenty years ; after the expira tion of that period it shall be open to either of the high contracting parties to determine the agreement by a year's notice. . ^ 1 (( nforma % to the Army Department for transmission to the Divi sion of the Chief of the Staff.) {Received on 17th June 1912, with Political Secretary's letter No 22 dated the 31st May 1912.)

[21766] No - !• . r India Office to Foreig 22.) i India Office, May 21, 1912. Sir, I am directed hy the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant on the subject of the Baghdad Railway and con nected questions. In reply I am to say that if, after the very full discussions that have already taken place, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considers that a further 62inter-departmental conference is necessary, the Marquess of Crewe will depute a representative of this Office to attend it. But, personally, he considers it suffi ciently established, that, regard being had to the magnitude of British interests involved, this country cannot with dignity, or, indeed, ^with safety, agree to par ticipate on a basis of less than 50 per cent., and he has always regarded the distri bution of 60 per cent.^between Great Britain, France, and Russia (or between the first two alone) as a wholly unacceptable, and even dangerous, alternative. Further, he holds very strongly the view of his predecessor (see paragraph 9 of Sir R Ritchie's letter of the 29th March, 1911) that a friendly agreement with Ger many is an essential preliminary to a satisfactory settlement, and I am to suggest that the Baghdad Railway Company and the German Government should at once be approached with a view to such a modification of the declaration of the.7th March, 1911, as would enable this country to participate in the Baghdad Basrah branch to an extent more nearly proportionate to our commercial interests in that region). As regards El Katr, I am to say that, in Lord Crewe's opinion, an entirely new situation would be created in the Persian Gulf, and one in every way detrimental to British interests, if the Turks were allowed to consolidate themselves there. Such consolidation is, indeed, contradictory of the main object of His Majesty's Gov ernment in attempting a settlement of questions in the Gulf, which was to elimi nate Turkish influence as far as possible, and in any case to limit it tothe head of the Gulf. That influence in El Hasa has existed only since Midhat Pasha's expedition in 1871, and may be said to exist at present on sufierance, for so long as the quasi- independence of Kuwait is maintained, El Hasa must remain more or less isolated. But the construction of the Baghdad Railway to Basrah or Kuwait will undoubtedly enable the Turkish Government to make their authority much more effective ; and the further result of allowing, under the sanction of a convention, the consolidation of Turkish power in the Peninsula of El Katr will, his Lordship thinks, be not only to enable the Turkish Government to extend and establish it in the interior, but also to give them a secure and recognised point d'appui within the British'sphere of interest. The position of Bahrein—as a kind of British enclave in Turkish territory— will be anomalous and precarious, while the Trucial Coast will become the scene of constant intrigues requiring increased vigilance— and therefore increased expenditure—on the part of His Majesty s Government to check it. Moreover, the Turkish desire to intervene jointly with us in the affairs of the Gulf will be strengthened, and will amount to something like a claim if Turkish authority is once recognised and effective. In Lord Crewe's opinion, no convention, however strictly drawn, can remove ■these disadvantages. He apprehends that the Turks will always intrigue ; that when taxed with it they will deny it or produce sufficiently plausible excuses ; while His Majesty's Government, with their many commitments elsewhere, will always have sufficient reason for not taking at any given moment an extreme step which would not be the less inconvenient or expensive merely because it happened to be justified by the terms of the convention. The Turkish garrison at El Bidaa—unrecognised for forty years, but, nevertheless, in possession — may, indeed, be regarded as a symbol of British policy in the Persian Gulf. Turning now to Mohammerah, Lord Crewe understands that the Turks are advancing extravagant claims, in the hope, by subsequent concessions there, of obtaining corresponding advantages elsewhere; and in your letter under reply the fear is expressed that if this hope is not realised, and the case goes to The Hague Tribunal, the result might be even to give to Turkey the line claimed by Dervish Pasha in 1850. Lord Crewe, as at present advised, sees no grounds for such an apprehension. That line was not accepted by the mediating commissioners, and his Lordship imagines that the evidence upon which they rejected it would weigh equally with The Hague Tribunal. Moreover, it is clear that the Turks do not greatly trust their own evidence, since otherwise they would not contemplate giving the line away in negotiation. It would seem to his Lordship to be more probable that the Hague Tribunal would fix a _ line approximating to that of the mediating commissioners ; andjf the alternatives are to allow the consolidationof Turkish authority in El Katr or to deprive the Sheikh of Mohammerah of the' district between the mediating commissioners' line and the frontier as locally observed, he would choose the latter as the lesser evil. In conclusion, I am to enquire whether Sir E. Grey is satisfied that it is im possible to reserve the rights of Mohammerah as regards any reference to The Hague Tribunal. It does not appear that there has been any material alteration m the status quo between Howeizah and the Shatt-el-Arab since the Treaty of Ji-rzeroum. In other words, there is no case in that region for arbitration, and the situation therefore differs entirely from that on the northern section, where it ia precisely the vital nature of the alterations made in recent years that is the cause o. the whole difficulty. This essential difference might perhaps be held to justify Persia m informing the Turkish Government (and His Majesty's Government in supporting her, should necessity arise) that, while there would be no objection to minor rectifications by The Hague Tribunal of the frontier locally recognised as compared with the mediating commissioners' line, no award substantially modi fying it will be accepted, J Copy of a telegram addressed to the Government of India is enclosed ; their reply, with any further observations that may be necessary, will be communicated to you m due course, i ' I am, &lt;&amp;c,, LIONEXi ABEAHAMS.

Grey, and it was intimated at the same time that the India Office would furnish an expression of opi nion ; a letter dated the 18th July, 1911, was hereupon written by Sir A, Hirtzel, in which he stated I understand that Lord Crewe has spoken to Sir E. Grey about this, and my instructions are to send you the enclosed copy of the Foreign Office memorandum with his Lordship's suggested alterations shown in manuscript,' all the suggested alterations were incorporated in this document, which was the,, draft of the proposed reply to the Turkish Ambassador, in so far as it related to the Baghdad railway, and it was not until that reply had been submitted to Lord Crewe and initialled by his Lordship that it was dispatched. Such being the sequence of events. Sir E. Grey learnt with regret, nine months after the reply has been despatched and its substance communicated to the French, Bussian, and Oerman Governments—an interval during which no intimation of his Lordship's change of attitude has reached Sir E. Grey.—that Lord Crewe has so far modified his attitude as to regard the distribution of capital proposed as ' wholly unaccept able and even dangerous/ , Sir E. Grey is unaware of the reasons which have led Lord Crewe to modify his views to so serious an extent as is implied by his letter under reply : but he must point out the very grave objections which exist to withdrawing the offer formally made to the Ottoman Government, after such long and serious consideration, after the lapse of so many months, and at a moment when the Turkish Ambassador has been instructed to discuss the proposals in the most friendly and accommodating spirit. His Majesty's Government are, in Sir E. Grey's cpinion, in honour com mitted to those proposals, and they must at any rate await their definite rejection before recommencing negotiations on a totally different basis, -—negotiations which, it must be remembered, failed on a previous occasion. The reply of the Turkish Ambassador is by no means of a character to warrant so subversive a departure from the rules of diplomatic procedure as a refusal to continue the negotiations would imply, for to demand a participation of 50 per cent, or 60 per cent, at this late stage of the proceedings would be tantamount to open rupture, and would cause great disappointment and apprehension at Constantinople. Moreover, pre liminary negotiations with France, Russia, and Germany would be necessary, unless indeed Germany consented at once to forego any share at all in • the Bagdhad-Basrah sections, which, in Sir E, Grey's opinion, it woujd be as unreasonable to ask as it would be difficult to obtain. Assuming that France and Russia were asked to renounce their shares and were excluded, a long and difficult negotiation with Germany would ensue, and a heavy price would have to be paid for her renunciation of a share equal to that of any other foreign Power ; and assuming further that a successful issue were reached, Sir E. Grey apprehends that it is not probable that the resumption of negotiations with the Ottoman Government would be facilitated, as they would deeply resent the discontinuance of the present discussion, and the initiation of negotiations betwen two Powers, England and Germany, one of whom has largely renounced her claims in return for a substantial quid fro quo, the other Of whom does not possess jany legal claim at all in those regions. The Ottoman Government, through the Turkish Ambassador in London, have requested that no negotiations or discussion in connection with the Baghdad railway should be conducted with the German Government, and His Highness was assured that no such procedure was contemplated. It was in consequence of the inability of His Majesty's Government to obtain a 50 per cent, participation for British interests that the proposals now before the Ottoman Government were made ; and Sir E. Grey thinks that one of the reasons then advanced for being satisfied with'a smaller participation has been overlooked in your letter under reply. If it be granted that His Majesty's Government can only protect British and Indian trade against adverse treatment by securing a partici* pation of 50 per cent., how are they then to avoid such adverse treatment on otherparts of the railway, e.g., on the branch to Khanikin, and if adverse treatment exists on that and other portions of the railway, the utility of securing equality of treat ment on the Baghdad-Basrah sections is not so apparent ? In Sir E. Grey's view, which, until the receipt of your letter under reply, he believed to be shared by your department, the most efficacious means of excluding differential treatment (not only on the Baghdad-Basrah sections but on all rail ways in Asiatic Turkey) is by a binding international agreement on the subject, and by making the continued levy of the increased customs duty dependent on the precise observance of that instrument. For these reasons Sir E. Grey hopes that the Marquess of Crewe will reconsider his views and allow the negotiations with the Turkish Ambassador to proceed on the basis of the proposals formally made to the Ottoman Government in July 1911. Sir E. Grey would remind Lord Crewe that His Excellency is anxious to discuss those proposals at an early date, and he thinks that a preliminary discussion between the departments concerned should take place as soon as possible. As regards the Peninsula of El Katr, Sir E. Grey naturally attaches the greatest weight to the views of the Marquess of Crewe, and although he is disposed to think that his Lordship s conclusions as to the result of conceding something to Turkey in this region are exaggerated, he does not think it necessary to continue at this stage the discussion on this point, as he would be averse from abating any of the demands advanced in the memorandum of the 29th July, 1911, for the present; he would, however, be glad if Lord Crewe would consider at his leisure in what direction it might be possible to make a concession to the Ottoman Government supposing a successful issue of the negotiations depended upon some modification of our extreme demands. If it were worth while to initiate these negotiations, it is worth while to continue them in a reasonable spirit. As to Mohammerah, Sir E. Grey does not consider it practicable to propose to the Persian Government that they should make a communication as proposed to the Turkish Government, or that His Majesty's Government should support Persia against Turkey in the manner suggested : Sir ' E. Grey does not consider that it would be possible to reserve this question from The Hague Tribunal if the Turkish Government persisted in such a reference ; but, if it is possible to prevent it, Sir E. Grey has no intention of allowing it, and proposes to treat a settlement of this fron- tier as part of the present negotiations and as a necessary condition of their conclu sion. A separate letter will be addressed to you shortly respecting the course which it is proposed to pursue in regard to the Mohammerah frontier negotiations. I am, &amp;c., LOUIS MALLET. .

Sir Edward Grey to Sir E. Goschen. Foreign Office, June 25, 1912. (No. 154.) Sir, IN the course of conversation with the German Ambassador to-day, I said that I was sure he knew more about the Bagdad Railway than I did ; but I should like to tell him how m itters stood, so that I might be certain that my version of some points was correct. The Turkish Government claimed that, as the concession beyond Bagdad had been given back to them by Germany in return for the Alexandretta concession, they were entitled to negotiate about it; and they desired that, while we negotiated with them, we should not negotiate with any one else. On this footing we were negotiating; but I understood that Germany, though relinquishing to Turkey the concession beyond Bagdad, had reserved the right to an equal participation with any other individual foreign capital. The Ambassador said that the correct way of expressing the situation was that the Bagdad Railway Company had agreed to transfer the concession beyond Bagdad to another company, but German participation must be as great as that of any other capital except Turkish, and some indemnity was to be allowed to the Bagdad Railway Company for more difficult portions of the line ; but he did not disagree that, in substance, the Turkish Government were entitled to negotiate as they were doing. He added that he understood the Turks now proposed that the railway should stop at Bussorah. I said that, as far as that point was concerned, we would acquiesce. The Ambassador then dwelt upon the Turkish objections to Russian capital, and said that they were natural, as Turkey suspected a political motive in everything which Russia did. I replied that we were aware of these objections, and the question of participation was not arranged. I proposed to continue negotiating with the Turks alone, as they desired ; but, if participation was arranged for the railway, the matter would then of course have to be discussed with Germany, and in any case I would tell him if the negotiations broke down and came to nothing, or what the final result was. The Ambassador expressed satisfaction at this. For the rest, I said that what we desired was to be sure of a status quo in the Gulf that would not be disturbed. He observed that we already had an agreement with Turkey as to the preservation of the status quo in Koweit, but no doubt there was always discussion as to what the status quo was. He dwelt upon the impos&gt;ibility of there being any differential duties without requiring certificates of origin. I said that it was feared that rates might be high on goods in which we were specially interested and low on goods in which Germany was interested. The Ambassador replied that this would be impossible under any ' cahier des charges.' Finally, I said that the ' crux ' of the whole matter was the 4 per cent, increase of Turkish customs dues. We could not agree to this without being able to satisfy Parliament that the status quo in the Persian Gulf was secure ; that it was settled where the Bagdad Railway was to end, and on what conditions ; and that there would be no differential rates. The Ambassador took no exception to any of the points raised. In the course of the conversation he observed that he had always said that the Bagdad Railway could not be carried to the Gulf without agreement with us, and that this view had been more readily accepted at Constantinople than in Berlin.

Extract from a telegram to Foreign from Keeldent, No.690 dated 6th July 191^# Firstly . It does not appear to me that the conceseion proposed would 'be one ' in appearance only* 1 . Bubyen and Warba having been claimed specifically in our Memorandum to the part of the sphere covered by guarantee their eliminination from its scope in the settlement arrived at will be tantamount to resigning them to Turkey unless there is placed on record a much stronger safeguard than the mere 'title to our good offices in the event of unprovoked attack*. With no better deterrent then that, the localities in question would be a Constant field for intrigue on the part of local Turkish authorities and a source of an xiety both to ourselves and the Sheikh who would certainly think that he had been treated with bad faith* No adequate safeguard can be suggested by me less than categorical recorded stipulation that while the town, harbour and immediate sur roundings should be completely autonomous the remainder of Ko- weit territory to the extent attributed t' it in Tiorimer , s Gazetteer (vide letter dated 9th May 1911 from Foreign Office to India Office) should be specifically recognised as being under the Administrative influence of the Sheikh of Koweit and that Porte should agree neither to place military posts nor take any other action within it without the previous joint consent both of the Sheikh and of ourselves. x X X XTelegram P ( , dated the 11th July 1912. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Kuwait. I have received from Sir P. Cox the following telegram No. 711, dated the 10th July 1912:—'A report * * * * newspapers Telegram P., dated the 13th July 1912. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Please refer to your telegram of 1st instant regarding the Baghdad Eailway negotiations. I find it difficult to reconcile the statement that the arrangement proposed is a concession in appearance only with the loss of large piece of territory by the Shaikh which is implied in the sentence immediately following. The Shaikh will naturally resent it if any real loss of territory is involved by these proposals, and the arrangement must consequently be deprecated. The necessity of carefully avoiding any concessions which Turkey may be able to transfer to Germany to our detriment or that may estrange the Shaikh and drive him into the hands of the Germans is emphasised by the news we have just received of an attempt on the part of the Germans to intrigue with Shaikh {vide my telegram of 11th instant). If, however, the present status quo is clearly defined in such a way as to place on record the existing administrative influence of the Shaikh throughout the wider limits attributed to Kuwait in Lorimer's Gazetteer; if Turkey admits Warba and Bubian are within Kuwait limits and withdraws their garrison, and if Turkey agrees within those wider limits not to take any action, military or otherwise, without our consent, the arrangement becomes practicable and will not involve loss of territory. Eull opportunity should, however, be given to us of explaining to Shaikh an arrangement contemplated concerning Kuwait and obtaining his previous concurrence. To the proposed Turkish Agent at Kuwait I see no objection, provided that Shaikh's position is recognised as autonomous and if we are given opportunity of explaining to Shaikh that the presence of an Agent is the natural result and price of autonomy and direct recognition of it as illustrated by the Khedive4 having a Turkish Agent at Cairo. It is understood Shaikh will, in regard to his properties in Turkish territory, be guaranteed enjoyment {vide memorandum to Porte). To a convention with Turkey confirming our agreements with Shaikh, there would be no objection, if terms are worded so as to imply nothing more than suzerainty, but will this satisfy Turkey who desires the terms to be compatible with her sovereign rights, which are out of the question ? Throughout these negotiations I need hardly emphasise the importance of avoiding anything which in eyes of Shaikh and consequently of Mohamtne- rah, Bahrain and Trucial Chiefs would appear want of good faith or admission of weakness on our part in a region where we are undoubtedly strong at the present moment.

S ir, I n continuation of my letter P.-2065 of the 10th instant, regarding the Baghdad Railway and connected questions, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of Dated 13th June 1912. a telegram that has been received from the Government of India as to the possibility of making concessions to the Turkish Government in the Persian Gulf with a view to arriving at a settlement of outstanding questions. The Marquess of Crewe desires me to remark that, in the porposals tnat have been put before the Turkish Government, Great Britian is claiming nothing new, but is asking merely for the recognition of the position which she has built up for herself there. It is rather Turkey who desires to alter the status quo by the assertion of claims, which she has never been, and is not now, in a position to enforce. This fact seems to put His Majesty's Government on strong ground morally for insisting upon full satisfaction, if so valuable a consideration as the increased cus toms duties is to be given ii^ return. If it be urged that an equally satisfactory result could be secured by a conven tion strictly defining the spheres of the ;two countries in the Gulf, Lord Crewe has as little confidence as have the Government of India that the semi-independent local Turkish authorities would adhere to its provisions, or that the Porte would be able or willing to compel them to do so except under such constant diplomatic pressure as could not fail to disturb the relations of the two countries. The intrigues of the Turks with tribes on the British side of the demarcated frontier near Aden, and the difficulty which His Majesty's Government has experienced in securing the ele mentary rights of British subjects at Baghdad are examples; and His Lordship fears that such a convention would merely perpetuate the state of things which it is desired to end. On the other hand, it must be recogniesd that the only alternative to a friendly settlement of these questions is the adoption of a much more resolute attitude in the Persian Gulf thanjHis Majesty's Government have hitherto thought desirable. The nature of the measures, which in certain eventualities it might be necessary to take, are indicated in the Government of India's secret letter No. 24, dated the 15th February last, copy of which was enclosed in my letter of the 7th March. With this alternative in mind^Lord Crewe concurs in the views expressed by the Government of India. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient Servant. ' - R. RITCHIE.

Mr. Lynch to Mr. Maxwell.—{Received June 22.) Dear Mr. Maxwell, 33, Pont Street, London, June 21, 1912. REVERTING to our conversation of yesterday, I enclose a paper which I read last year before the Central Asian Society,and would beg to refer you to pp. 9 and 10, which have reference to the branch line between Bagdad (Sadijeh) and Khanakin. The Bagdad-Khanakin trade route into Persia has been developed exclusively by Englishmen, practically by members of my own family, and the value of British goods conveyed by this route amounts to over 1,000,0001. a-year—a figure which compares with under 100,000/. for the trade of all other European countries, including Germany. I think you will admit that I have a hereditary claim to put in a word for the future of this British trade. I do hope that our Government will do their very utmost to safeguard this trade and also the trade between Trebizond and Tatreez. It is true that the Bagdad Railway Company, having secured the surplus of the Ottoman Public Debt, are probably in a position to complete the railway to Bagdad and the Persian frontier. But I understand that the greater part of the railway bonds are still in the safes of the Deutsche Bank, and naturally the German promoters are most anxious to get these bonds taken up in France and England, I am certain, therefore, that they would stretch a good many points in order to secure the goodwill of England and France. Now, for us it is vital to obtain an effective voice in the management of the line between Bagdad and the Persian frontier. Bagdad is already the terminus of our river-borne trade; it will soon be connected with the Mediterranean by the Bagdad- Mosul line, and later probably by a line along the Euphrates. Bagdad is therefore destined to be the reservoir into which several main streams of commerce will pour. The bulk of the goods will be goods in transit for Persia, and it is of the utmost importance that perfectly equal treatment should be secured for British goods as compared with goods from Germany or other countries. This can only be secured by financial participation in the branch from Bagdad to the Persian frontier. Nor can I see why the Germans should refuse such participation. It would greatly help them to have Great Britain on their side in the efforts which they will have to make sooner or later to keep the door open in Persia by this route. I do, therefore, trust that this proposal may ba pressed in any negotiations with Germany over the Bagdad Railway question. As regards the proposed railway from Bagdad down the Tigris, I am still at a loss to discover what objects this railway is to serve, unless it be purely strategical objects in relation to the British position on the Persian Gulf. It is surely obvious that all the military requirements of Turkey in policing the Arab tribes between Bagdad and Bussorah and in those regions would be met by steamer transport. The fact that I am engaged in promoting a railway up the valley of the Karun goes to show, I hope, that the opinion I have formed of a railway between Bussorah and Bagdad is not influenced by private considerations. River transport can look after itself alongside of a railway. But if our Government is to be asked to support a railway it ought surely to be made clear that there will be some commercial gain. If the railway is to be built as the result of a further 3 per cent, increase of the customs duties, the result, so far as Manchester goods are concerned, will be that they will have to submit to an additional tax of 60s. a-ton in order to have the luxury of an alternative route up to Bagdad. Under these circumstances, it would surely be better to go slow as regards this railway and to await the developments of irrigation. Any other course would result in the squandering of vast sums of money raised at the expense of the Turkish tax-payer without conferring any benefits upon British trade—rather the contrary. Yours sincerely, H. F. B. LYNCH. [2511 2/-4] * Not printed.J o y w 7.

(No. 482.) • Constantinople, June 5,1912, Sis, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Maiesty's vice- consul at Adana enclosing a report on the Baghdad Railway in that vilayet. I have, etc., GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Vice-Consul Mason to Sir G. Lowther. (No, 2.) Adana, May 24,1912. SIE, I have the honour to forward a report on the Baghdad Railway in this vilayet, being information gathered from a tour to Baghtche last February in the company of Mr. Childs of the firm of Weston and Childs, architects, Constantinople, to whom I am indebted for much technical matter, and from various sources since then. I have, etc., . A. MONCK MASON, Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Report hy Vice-Consul Mason respecting the Baghdad Railway. The stretches of the Baghdad Railway now open to general traffic in this vilayet are those between Mersina and Adana, Dorak and Yenidje, and Adana and Ma'moure (also called Bulgurlu). The line Dorak-Yenidje- 7Adana-Ma 5 moure is that recently officially inaugurated in the presence of the Minister of Public Works. The Division Yenidje-Adana forms part of the Mersina-Tarsus-Adana Railway; it is a strip of little importance from a traffic point of view, as it merely joins Yenidje to the foot of the Taurus Mountains. On the other hand, the Adana-Ma 5 moure line runs through some 75 miles of rich cotton and cereal country, where the roads are execrable. Here the new railway cannot fail to prove a great factor in the opening up to commerce of the Adana plain, whch is now traversed from end to end by the Baghdad Railroad. The station of Ma'moure (the village itself lies at some miles' distance in the hills) is situated at the furthest north-east limit of the plain; from this point it will climb to Baghtche, rising 1,500 feet in about 28 miles, where a two small and one long (5 kilom.) tunnel are to pierce the Arslanli Bel. As regards the general construction of the newly opened lines, it is obvious that no expense has been spared, though the engineers have not, in every case, found themselves able to cope with the natural difficulties of the country they have to deal with. Thus, although the bridges over the Sihun at Adana and over the Pyramus at Missis are justly admired as masterpieces of bridge construction, and although the rail is laid with steel sleepers throughout and is exceptionally heavy, the engineers would not seem to have taken sufficiently into account the force of the floods which are a regular feature of the winter months in this vilayet. Between Adana and Missis I noticed in February last that in no less than four cases —there were doubtless more—culverts and waterways had been completely washed out by recent rains; either the culverts had been made too narrow or too wide and inadequately supported. In this connection I may point out that parts of the Mersiana-Adana Railway are at much too low a level, as is evi denced by the fact that the line frequently became impassable to traffic during the rainy season. The two larger tunnels also appear to be giving the engineers pause, especial ly that through the Taurus at Bozanti. Reliable information is scarce, but I have it from a good source that the site of this tunnel has not yet been definitely decided upon ; it is variously estimated that from three to five years will see the work completed ; the latter figure is the more likely to be correct. As to the Arslanli Bel tunnel, the G erman delegate at Baghtche, Herr Anders (now acting vice-consul at Adana), told me that excavation was going on at the rate of 2 metres a day on each working face, but, as during my short day's stay at Baghtche he avoided showing Mr. Childs or myself the work in progress I venture to doubt his statement. The boring of the two smaller tunnels between Baghchet and the Amauns is also progressing, though not very speedily. Buildings at the new station, which lies nearly a mile to the north of the old and quite outside of the town, are about one-third completed. At Yenidje, Zeitounli, and Chakir-Pacha, on the Mersina-Adana line, they may be said to be ready. In the stations east of Adana work is not far advanced, though even at Baghtche, more than 20 miles beyond the present railhead, some few buildings are going up. Between Ma'moure and Baghtche the greater part of the embank ment is finished, though in the valley of the Baghtche there is one large gap of about 2 miles, and at one point there will be necessary a difficult piece of bridging some 100 yards long over the bed of the stream. At present it must be said that the work is going forward very slowly. In the Taurus this state of things cannot be helped, as progress can only be made during the summer and autumn. Moreover, prices are rising, and with them the labour bill, which even in the beginning was very considerably underesti mated. There are rumours that the finances of the railway are at a low ebb, but I see no particular reason to believe it. Be that as it may, the company has recently raised both the passenger and the freight charges on the Adana-Mersina Railway by about 30 per cent.

Crawford's letter, and I am to suggest, for Sir E # Grey's consideration, that an immediate enquiry might be addressed to Sir G. Lowther on this point. The Board, as they have already indicated in their letter of the 10th January last, would have much preferred that the construction and exploitation of the bonded ware houses at Baghdad should have been left to the Joint action of the Baghdad companies and of the companies which may here after operate the line to be constructed between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf.

My whole party, men and animals, benefited by the hard work and we all felt that our general condition and health on return was far better than at starting and due to the bracing tonic air of the open desert. Extracts from Diary of the Political Agent's tour from Kuwait to As-Safa, Hafar, Al Batin, Safwan and back to Kuwait; February igio. 2Qth January, —Busy over final preparations, but Shaikh Mubarak came in afternoon to bid me God-speed. He insisted on my &gt; taking some of his men but at last agreed that one man with a couple of his hawks and a thalul would suffice in addition to my own Bedouins. Zaid is the man's name and he is of the Tiblan Umtair; seems a capable fellow. The names of the Shaikh s two hawks are ' Barkat' a very fine Hurr, and ' Shalwah ' a Shihan not as good as my own Shihan ' jumlah As the trip is to be one with long distances between water-places, have decided to leave the Mullah behind and use his two camels for water and food. The party to start to-morrow will therefore be Self, a Mad- rassi cook, a negro bottle-washer and utility-man, a river Arab as personal servant, ^ Nejada camel-men. Khalaf with three other of my Bedouins, a Bedouin chaprassi and Zaid the Shaikh's man. The live-stock consists of 13 hamla(bapgage camels), 8 ' thaluls ' (riding camels), 3 hawks a greyhound and 11 sheep for meat. Am leaving two Bedouins-— Mathoor and Mahomed bin Aamir behind for the first two posts with orders for the former to meet me at Hafar on the 12th February and the latter at Rigai on the 16th February, 30th January, —Cloudy morning looking like rain, but we started, the loading up showing more method than on my first trip last November. Left the Agency at 9'3o A. M. and cleared the town in half-an-hour going due south. The road is a well-defined track with first half of march absolutely bare, but later we came on some grass, weeds and ' arafij grazing. Camped at 2-45 in a patch of good arafij ' just short of Malha with Burgan, Wara and Maadaniyat Hills all visible. Marching of the ' hamla ' not parti cularly good as hardly settled down to work on the first day. Rain came on in the evening and this probably means a late start to-morrow. 21 st January.—Zzxdi joined us with the two hawks. ^ Rain most of the night and as tents sopping wet decided to halt, but sun coming out dried^ up things rapidly so we managed to march at noon. Passed Malha wells in a little over an hour. The remains of what apparently was once a hut just above the wells are known as Kasr-i-Malha. Got to the top of Wara Hill about 4 P.M , whence fine view. Hill seems to be a curious out-crop of some kind of lime stone rock jutting up 80 to 100 feet in an otherwise flat or very slightly undu lating plain. After another hour's march camped at 5 P.M., about north-west from Burgan Hill and not far from one of my previous camps. ' Hamla' marching fairly. 1st February. —Sent on two men and water-camels ahead to Subaihiya wells to fill up every available water-skin as probably no more water until As- Safa 6 or 7 days hence. Owing to heavy dew last night could not get off until 9-30 A M., and loaded up skins, leaving at noon south-west for As-Safa which is said to be 41 hours hence Zaid very keen we should go due west to strike the 'jada' (main road) direct to As-Safa which he says starts from At-Towil a little west of Wara' Hill, I don't agree, as I want to fix Thamila-ut-Turki, which, from my previous tour, round here, seems to be wrongly-placed on Knox's map, and Khalaf says it is almost in our track if we make a bee-line from Subaihiya for As-Safa. Found Thamila-ut-Turki after nearly three hours' march to be a little off our road to left; it must be quite 10 miles south-east of the position Knox gives it, but I got bearings to Burgan and Wara and an approximate bearing to Grain Hill (invisible) which with careful dead reckoning should fix it tolerably accurately. From this Thamilat at which the wells had fallen in and there was no water we bore a little more to our right and eventually reached, at 4-10 P.M., the top of the ridge dividing Ash-Shag from the eastern drainage and camped after another | hour's march. Camels marching neither good nor bad. Zaid managed to lose the Shaikh's Hurr hawk ' Barkat ' the first time he put her up, but succeeded in getting one hubara with the Shihan which we used for completing ' Jumlah's' training. 2nd February. —Marched at 9-20 A .M., and soon sighted Fowaris Hill about south-south-east. Continued descending steadily into the Shigaig, after crossing which and rising a little over the ridge between this valley and Ash-Shag passed a little south of another of my previous camps. At this point the Shag is very difficult to define beyond that it lies between the ridge just mentioned and stops as soon as one reaches the bare gravel where the A1 Garaa waste begins. This we did at 1-20 P M. Soon we had lost all marks and there was absolutely no track nor a vestige of anything by which to know direction except the sun. We were steering about south-west and my compass showed Khalaf held his course very steadily. The camels began to march better after leaving the u arafij ' grazing of Ash-Shag, the Bedouin reason being that they are anxious to get on to the next grazing. We camped at 4 -ao P.M., on the bare plain with not a scrap of life, animal or vegetable, visible to the horizon which was a dead level line all round giving exactly the effect of being at sea. Fortu nately we had carried some firewood with us and that eked out with camel- dung made the cooking-fire. yd February. —Marched at 8-45 keeping about the same direction with a shade less south in it. Halted a few minutes for the ''asr' prayer andthen on again, the camels marching well. Camped at 4-30 p.m., in the same desolate waste. The ground appears to have a very gentle rise the w*hole way from Ash-Shag and water should drain ofi it in a south-east direction. 4th Marched at 9 a.m., as according to Khalaf the distance between the ' arafij ' of Ash-Shag and the ' hamth' grazing is 20 hours across Al-Garaa at this point and we have done nearly 13 hours' good marching. Saw first sign of life in distant troops of gazelle, making it certain we were not far off possible grazing. Both yesterday and to-day saw several mirages of the story-book type, one being a particularly beautiful one of a lake with trees and palms overhanging it and their reflections showing in the water. At 1 1 -45 a.m., came on a shallow green dell into which every camel's nose went down at once,' whilst the men with many ejaculatory ' Thanks be to God ', ' God is bountiful etc., slid off their mounts and rushed to collect materials for a fire as soon as permission was given for coffee to celebrate the occasion. After a rest of three- quarters of an hour we started again for the edge of the ' hamth ' grazing now visible. ^ Reached it by 1 -10 p.m., and camped so as to give the camels a chance of getting some thing into their bellies. The ' hamth ^ here is the most uninviting-looking dired-up bush, but there was a certain amount of green herbage at the roots of the bushes which the camels made for greedily. Saw some sand- grouse flighting in the evening but much too high for a shot. Zaid successfully stalked a hare which his hungry Bedcuin eyes located lying up under a bush near our track. The camels have marched exceptionally well over the last two days' waste. 5M Fehruary. —Marched at 9 a. m. and after an hour struck into the ' Jada' mentioned before. It is said to run quite straight from As-Safa to Khabra-ud Dawis and then to bend eastwards to make At-Towil whilst a branch from Khabra-ud-Dawish goes more or less straighten to Kuwait leaving the Managish Hills on its north. The ' Jada ' runs more southerly than our course hitherto and we followed it for the rest of the day all through ' hamth ' bushes until we camped at 4-20. Camels marching badly to-day because they are hungry and insist on grazing by the way. Ground still appears to be rising very slightly. 6th February —Marched at 8-45 a, m. and soon found ground began to change, several dry water-courses crossing the road flowing from west to east. Was able to get bearings again as a few hills began to show up to south of the track. At 12*30 p.m. began to descend into the basin in which the As-Safa wells lie and at 1 -45 p, m. got to Thaleh-uth-Thuleh, the highest hillock in the basin and overlooking the wells about a couple of miles further south-west. Pitched camp under another hillock about f mile nearer the wells, and sent off for more water as what was left of the Subaihiya supply furnished a long anticipated bath. Marching of camels the last two days not at all good. Spent the afternoon taking bearings all round. One of the baggage camels added a ridiculous white baby to our numbers The event was welcome as supplying fresh milk for the rest of the tour, though the infant will have to be carried for two or three days. yth February intended to halt here a day but the grazing is scanty and the men fearful of possible raiders, for, though our ' rafiqs ' safe-guard us from any Ajman or Umtair bands, other very distant tribes from Central Arabia visit these well's. The wells are said to number about 20 and to average 25 fathoms in depth. They are nearly all stone-lined and are said to have been the work of the ancients. They lie in a basin which has steep gravelly clay cliffs of about 100 feet high on its northern edge, down which come rain-torrents from the table-lsnd further to the north The ground is not so steep on the opposite (southern) side and the depression seems to drain away north-north east by a broad valley called Shaib-al-Faisal. We found the water in the wells quite yellow and rather fouled by recent rains having washed in camel and sheep droppings from the numerous adjacent camping places. It was fairly sweet and is said to be the best water between Kuwait and Zilfi, a not impossible fact considering there are only one or two other water-holes between As-Safa and that place.After filling up all water-skins marched at 11. A. M. climbing out of the depression by a rather bad track on to the northern plateau, which after a short time turned out to carry any amount of the most succulent green fodder, ground herbage of various kinds, most of them in flower. One especially liked by the camels is called' shigara ' and has a purple flower which when seen in large masses at some distance gives the appearance of heather. As camels were marching slow we decided to make a short day of it and halted at 1-30 p. m. between two knolls with the ' jada ' (main road) from As-Safa to Hafar some distance away to our left. Zaid got a couple of hubara to-day. M February. —Marched at 8-50 a.m. keeping through excellent^ grazing when at 10-15 a.m. a dust-cloud on the horizon showed up and was diagnosed as a party of horsemen obviously making for a raid on us. Camels were made to kneel as hurriedly as possible, each man got his rifle and ammunition and hurried off to adjacent hillocks taking cover in the most approved light infantry style, the cook remaining on guard over the camels with a gun and a supply of No. 5 shot cartridges! The attack had developed by this time and my glasses showed about 20 to 30 horsemen galloping at their best pace for us in a wide enveloping semi-circle. The men were told not to fire until the raiders were close as they might prove to be friends, but a few wild shots from the attackers started my camel men off and their shooting was execrable. It did not last very long for as the raiders got up to us and galloped through making for our camels, we heard their war-cry ' Haif, Haif, Al-Umtair, Al-Umtair'. Immediately my Bedouins heard this they waved their rifles and head-kerchiefs yelling u Al-Umtair, Al-Umtair, don't shoot The firing stopped then, but the raiders had made good their dash for the camels. It turned out that they were a party of the Al-Fugam Umtair under their Shaikh Haif and his brother Jafran who apologised profusely for their mistake and as no one had been hurt we foregath ered round a fire and coffee was soon going round. Haif who had visited me in Kuwait explained he was on his way to raid the Ajman and had taken us for a party of them. He had with hinij besides the 30 or so horsemen who got into us first, about 60 to 80 thalul-riders. We parted the best of friends with no harm done to either side, whilst I had gained the experience of a real Bedouin attack It was dashingly delivered and the way the attacking party gallops in at widely extended intervals accounts for the few casualties always reported in these raids. The thalul-riders support the horsemen and generally get up a few minutes after the horsemen have run into the camels to be raided. I am told they generally pay no more attention than they are forced to the dismounted defenders, their main object being to drive off the camels as soon as possible. These raiding parties travel very light, each man's food consisting of a few handfuls of dates and a few pieces of bread which is all he carries besides his arms and ammunition on his person or his mount. A few skins of water are carried for general use by some of the thalul-riders and there are no other baggage or spare animals. They can do, thus equipped, marches of 50 or more miles a day, raid their intended prey during the night and put another 50 miles between themselves and the scene of action before the following sunset. Any mount going lame or a man sick has to leave the party at once and make the best of his own way out of danger and back to his tribe's tents as best as can. The Bedouin say they can, in the winter season, go without water them selves three days and without food two days, but their mares cannot dispense with water for more than 30 hours. We resumed our march at 11-45 a. m. with the camels not marching well, and camped at 4 p. m. These Arabs were the first we had seen since leaving my first camp. gth February. —Marched at 8-45 a. m., veering a little to the left until we struck the ' Jada' between As-Safa and Hafar at 10-15. Followed this through splendid grazing until at^-so p. m. we came to a small mound on the road called Masjid-ibn-Rashid, It is said to have been a rough pile made by Muhammad ar-Rashid in the days when he over-ran most of northern Arabia to mark the half way point between Hafar and As-Safa, which places are each 12 hours distant (loaded camels' pace). Continuing, we camped on the road at 4-30 p. m., the5 camels going about fair. Passed large numbers of the various sections of the Umtair with their tents, herds and camels moving slowly eastward over the excellent grazing on the whole of this plateau. Heard report that some of the Malaiba Umtair were raided last night by Dhafir Bedouin. loth February. —Sent off Ghanaim with a post to Kuwait and hope he arrives all right. Marched at 9 a. m. keeping along the well-defined track until at 1 p. m we began to descend into the Falaij-al-Janubia which comes in from the south and drains into the basin, of the Hafar wells It is abroad valley and about 50 feet below the surrounding plateau As Khalaf said we had got well on our way, we halted at 4 p.m., the camels having marched fairly well. Zaid lost the Shaikh's remaining hawk Shalwa Considerable excitement at numerous horse-tracks, fairly fresh, and obviously those of the raiding party we heard about yesterday. nth February, —Marched at 9 a. m. and kept veering gradually more and more to the north following the Falaij bottom. Khalaf rather nervous about approaching the Hafar wells too close, so we camped an hour short of them in a convenient fold of the ground at 1 p m., and sent on Khalaf and another man to reconnoitre as we wanted water badly. They came back after an hour very much scared and with a report that they had seen a large body of raiders in possession of the wells, watering their animals. They said they had counted about 10 or a dozen horsemen and estimated the a thaluls' at a hundred; the party were moving off east and were probably either Dhafir, Muntafik or Shammar. There was nothing to be done except lie low and hope we should not be seen. I had a look round later and decided it would be safer to march at sundown, take up our water in the'dark and continue our road up A1 Batin by night, thus cutting in behind the raiders and getting away before they should return to water their horses. Accordingly the water-camels went on ahead while we struck camp, had a meal, and followed at 8 p m. It was pitch-dark with no moon to help, but after the camels had settled down and the men stopped chattering we got along all risjht; the camels' pad-feet in the soft sand made so little sound that 20 yards off it would have been almost impossible to hear our caravan. We reached the well agreed upon in an h jut to find no signs of the men sent on ahead or their beasts. This made things exceedingly awkward, for the wells are notoriously unsafe at night, that being the only time outlaws and those with unpaid blood-money due from them take their water. We had only two or three empty water-skins, the nearest water was two good marches away, and the 30 fathoms rope required for these wells with the rest of the skins was with the missing men. We couched the camels and three of us visted every well in the place with the bare result that water had been freshly spilled at one. The only solution seemed to be that the men must have got frightened at our delay and gone on ahead by our intended route up A1 Batin. Accordingly, we marched at 10 p.m., our, course being with the ' North Star in your left eye' as the Bedouin, put it. It was too dark to read the compass very well and the Bedouins were nervous about striking a light giving us away. After about 20 minutes I was relieved to hear a whisper which proved to be Zaid looking for us What we had surmised had happened and he had the water-camels hidden a little way off. We continued our way up A1 Batin, the camels marching particularly well—because they could not see to graze was the Bedouins' reason. It was bittery cold and by 2 a.m. (of the 12th February) I decided we were far enough from the wells to be fairly safe, so we bivouacked in the open without tents or a fire, with the camels parked to windward to keep off as much of the wind as possible, though we got the benefit of their powerful scent instead. 12th February. soon after dawn, rather damp with the dew, but after some coffee got off at 8 a.m. and marched for if hours, the camels going badly, and then camped for a rest. U is unfortunate I had to travel this part of AI Batin at night, as curiously enough Knox also did it at night, though in the reverse direction. 1 wanted to send back to try and pick up Mathoor, my post-sowar, who should hava reached Hafar yesterday or to-day, but the Bedouin considered the idea rank foolishness and eventually I agreed that Mathoor would probably be able to look after himself well enough and if he came down to the wells might pick up our tracks and follow ; however, if he did not catch us up before Rigainor we meet him coming down thence, two of the Bedouins would return as he must be waiting at Hafar according to my orders given in Kuwait. iFebruary. —Marched at 10-15 along the eastern slope of A1 Batin which must be some 4 to 5 miles wide from bank to bank and perhaps 100 to 150 feet below the surrounding plateau. We passed Kasr-Bella , a mound only re maining of what must have been only a small building with signs of a well and tank alongside, the latter apparently well-built with 11 juss mortar, the channels, etc., being still plainly visible. 1 he story of the place is that Belial was a slave of the old-time rulers of Basra who was placed in command of a post here to safe-guard the caravan route from Basra to Nejd. He dug the well and used to have a small garden which was irrigated from the tank by the well. 1 he story is not improbable, judging by the remains visible. Later, we passed the mounds of Ath-Tharaband, the knoll of A1 Ashar, and camped in the first of the nullah-like torrent-beds called Athariyat, which run down from the eastern plateau into the Batin, at 4 -15 p.m. the camels having marched fairly well. • i4tJi February —Marched at 8-45 a.m. and camels going fairly passed the Kharja mounds and soon after climbed out of A1 Batin across a ravine or two reaching the Rigai wells at 2-15. The wells lie in the bed of another ravine and are curious in having underground galleries connecting some of them. The water is excellent, but only obtainable in small quantities at a time and then only after good rains. We were met by Muhammad bin Aamir waiting for us with his post. We went on a bit east-north»east to ttie level of the plateau near Ummal Hamir, a shallow green depression, and camped at 3 p.m. Here we got the news of Shaikh Mubarak's collecting a force for a big raid and Zaid, his man, begged to be allowed to go to join him, saying that raiding with the Shaikh was ' food from God ' for poor Bedouins. As he was not much use without his hawks, 1 let him go, using him to send a post into Kuwait. Two men also were told off to leave to-morrow morning for Hafar to bring up Mathoor whom we heard had been given refuge by Faisal*ud-Dawish, the head of the Umtair Shaikhs. r§th February. —Remained halted whilst two men went back for Mathoor. Took some more bearings and got through some letters. In afternoon Mandil, the young Shaikh of the Malaiba Umtair, called in on us with a small raiding party returning from an unsuccessful effort against the Shammar. Passed the news with him until he left to rejoin his tents south of Mosannah. Some stray Bedouins met at the wells say that the large parly we saw at Hafar were of the Anazah, with Saud bin Lami as their guide, and had been looting Awazim and Kuwait Araibdar. ' We were well out of the place, it appears. 16th February —Still halted, but after dinner Mathoor and the other two men returned, Mathoor having had an exciting time. He got to Hafar on the 32th morning, and must have passed us in our night-march quite close, as he says he travelled that night for safety just to the east and clear of A1 Batin. On arrival near the wells he was fired at by two men, but evaded them and met some of Faisal-ud-Dawish's followers who wanted to loot him on the spot as he was a Dhafiri without a ' rafiq'; but he appealed to Faisal, with his post-bag and some soda-water bottles as his credentials and Faisal very magnanimously gave him shelter. On Faisal's departure Mathoor went down again to the wells and having no rope or water-skin managed to exist two whole days without a drop of water to drink and only then broached a bottle of my soda. He had had to hide from the Anazah party which returned to the wells as we had expect ed. He had hung about near the wells until my other two men found him and brought in his post safely, having incidentally proved himself a man of rather above average Bedouin courage. 77^Decided to go on as soon as the water-skins could be filled^ and so marched at 11-45 about north-north-east to get down into A1 Batin again. M e had some bad ground to cross called Shigaya and got into the bottom of the valley at 2 45 p.m. whence we kept more north-east and camped at 4 15 p.m. under a knoll called Thaleh-al-Obaid. Any number of sand -grouse in the valley and managed to bag a few for the pot.iSth February. —Marched at 8-50 and in two hours came on traces of ancient reservoirs called Gulban. These appear to have been well -and solidly built though filled up and barely visible now ; found some greenish-glazed pottery chips round them quite unlike anything obtainable now in Kuwait or amongst Bedouins and which appear to be old. Passed large camps of Soluba with numbers of mangy camels but splendid flocks of sheep. Good steady marching until 4 p. M. when we halted among a number of Breh Umtair tents. The Shaikh is away raiding and rejoices in the name of The father of the Long Mustachois'! igth February. —Bought some sheep for the larder and then sent off AH bin Aatnir with a post to Kuwait and orders to meet me on the Gaishaniya road with the return post. Marched at 9 a. m. about north-east follwing the Al Batin which seems to be broadening out and getting gradually shallower. Passed some more traces of reservoirs about an hour before camping at 3-30 p. m., just beyond the opening in the eastern bank where the Shigat-al-Wasiya debouches into Al Batin. Fairly good going. Clouds of sand-grouse all the way. One of the reservoirs we passed is said to have been excavated by the Dhafir tribes men some years ago to a depth of 20 fathoms in the hope of re-utilizing it. Water was not reached but the building was good solid stone set in mortar. 20th February. —Marched at 8-45 a. m. keeping a little more north than before, and sighted Jarishan Hill at 1 -15 p.m. Kept on through magnificent grazing and camped at 3-30 p. m. close to Jarishan hill and one of Knox's pre vious camps. Camels travelling well. 21st February. —Marched at 8-40 following the bottom of Al Batin which is beginning almost to disappear. At 11-30 reached Halaiba with traces of old wells and a clump of stunted wild-plum trees, looking very dried»up and dead, but still the first thing in the shape of a tree seen in the whole of this trip. Quarter of an hour after came on a camp of Mubarak's nephews (the sons of the murder-. ed Muhammad bin Subah) whose home is in Zubair, but who were out here hawking. 1 hey complained that there was little sport this year owing to the excellent rains. Sent on the ' hamla ' and stopped to an al fresco lunch with them, eaten sitting round in the common circle a 1' Arabe. Caught up the '* hamla ' at 2-30 p m. who were heading too much towards Safwan. Altered course for Ar Ratk and got there by 4-15 p. m. and camped. Got good bear ings, but it is unfortunate having left the u hamla ' as 1 shall not be able to be so certain about to'day's dead-reckoning. Al Batin ends here. 22nd February —Marched east-south-east at 8-35 so as to leave Sanam hill on our left and make a bee-line for the Gishaniya wells. Passed several water-courses, but the ground is bare compared to the splendid grazing in Al Batin. Camped at 2-50 p.m. after some very good going. In sight of Sanam and with Safwan-fort due north. 22rd February. —Marched at 8-50 and reached the Gishaniya wells in 2 hours, turned south then for some good grazing ground and camped after about half an hour. Ghanaim arrived in evening with post from Kuwait. 24th February. —Halted and enjoying a rest, though a number of evil-look ing Thukara, apparently the off-scourings of the river towns and allied to the Muntafik have their tents near us. A shot was fired at our tents yesterday in the afternoon, but we could not lay hands on the culprit. 2$th February.—Mzxchedi at 8-25 and struck a bit south-west to make the high road between Jahara and Safwan which runs almost perfectly straight between the two places and not as shown on the map. Were sniped at for some time by Thukara who refused to be convinced by the waving of cloaks that we were peaca- ble travellers. Finally, had to go and threaten them with Mubarak's wrath before they would desist. As no one was hurt the fire was not worth returning. Looked like rain so camped at 4-5 p.m. on the main road close to the mounds called Hissu-ud-Thabi. Rain began soon after and kept up most of the night. 26th February. —Could not march, tents being soaked through but hea^d that Lyle of Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. in Basra, was camped a mile further on, returning from a visit to the Shaikh at Kuwait, Sent him a message to8 come and join me and halt a day. He did, and fortunately so ; we had rain most of the day. 27th February. —Lyle went off towards Basra and I packed up shortly after for Jahara. Camels marched well and we got over the Mutlaa pass all right before dark, camping to the north of Jahara town. 28th Fehruary. —Made an early start for Kuwait going on ahead with the Bedouin. Heard Bin Saud had arrived in Kuwait and in the distance saw Shaikh Mubarak's army making for the rendezvous near Jahara. Got into Kuwait early in the afternoon and went to see the Shaikh in the evening where made the acquaintance of Abdul Aziz bin Saud, who expressed considerable surprise at the length and distance of my tour, and still more that I had enjoyed it. K uwait; ^ W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, Ca/teVz, 10th March igio, ) Political Agent ) Kuwait* . No. C.-15, dated Kuwait, the 4th April 1910. From— C aptain W. H. I. S hakespear, Political Agent, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Busbire. In continuation of my letter No. 133, dated the 23rd March 1910, I have the honour to forward herewith a tracing showing my recent tour to As-Safa, Hafar and A1 Batin together with a note of the geographical information gained during the tour. 2. The information may he of use to the Intelligence Branch at Army Head quarters, and perhaps also the Survey Department. Note on Captain Shakespear's tour via As-Safa, AUHafar^ Al-Batin and hack to Kuwait. The accompanying observations and bearings were recorded during the tour with a trustworthy Prismatic Compass and read from it on a sieady tripod stand. The information collected on the route is, I think, fairly accurate as it was furnished by more than usually reliable Bedouins who knew the country well, and I checked it as often as possible. The accompanying map was plotted after return to headquarters, and may be inaccurate in the Longitude and Latitude lines which I had to take to the best of my ability from other maps of different scales. The rate of marching on which I depended for my dead-reckoning, a most important item in so featureless a country, was that given by my baggage-camels checked by daily notes of their rate of travel. It will be well to explain here that baggage-camels in Arabia march loose in a bunch and are not tethered nose and tail. Consequently they make better progress than the Indian beast. Their rate of travel is very steady and I have found in the course of two tours that three miles an hour as an average is very farly accurate. Bad ground may diminish this, and if the camels are in poor' condition they will not do so much, especially if travelling in good succulent grazing country, for they graze on the march. On the other hand if they are in good condition, their stomachs fall, or the desert bare of grazing, they will often do considerably more, even up to perhaps 3J miles an hour. Trying to keep a dead-reckoning by ' thalul's ' (riding-camel's) pace when on the march I have found well-nigh impossible. Mv camels marched a deal better during the latter half of the tour owing to improvement in condition and being able to fill their bellies easily with a few hours' grazing as a result of an excellent ' rabia'; moreover their loads became lighter daily. 3. It would have made my efforts at sketching this hitherto unsurveyed country of more value if I could have had with me a measuring perambulator of some type and a good pocket aneroid to show slight differences in heights. Onethat would read to 50 feet with a maximum of, say, 4 ,000 feet, would be most suitable,if such an article is available. I had a private one which reads up to 15, 000 feet, but found it useless. 4. The accompanying map is traced from the original plotting and there may be inaccuracies due to tracing, but I trust not many. The red contour lines on it do not represent heights, but are an attempt to show the main rise and fall and drainage of the ground; this applies also to the blue streams which only appear as such for a few hours after heavy rain. In my tour the points Burgan Hill and Wara Hill were known, in the sense that they have apparently been surveyed by ajqualified surveyor with theodolite or plane-table and their positions, taken from the Secret ' Map of Country round Kuwait, scale i' to 4 miles', Register No. 914-S. of 1906 are assumed to be correct. I left these known points , on the 1st February and only again came on another fixed point (on the same ma P)&gt; .J e ^ e l Sanam, on the 21st February after some 350 miles. My dead- reckoning would appear to have been fairly accurate as I closed on this hill to within a few miles. In my map I have not attempted to distribute the error, but left it in the march from Jarishan Hill to Ar Ratk. 5. The bearings given as ' invisible approximate ' were taken from the direc tion carefully pointed out by my Bedouin guides and are of interest merely to show how very good a reliable Bedouin's sense of direction really is, for they had no marks or tracks to go by other than the sun and stars. 6. The asterisked notes below deal in detail with certain points and refer to the corresponding red asterisks in the accompanying observations. ^1. Thamilat-ut-Turkz. —I think this place is shown incorrectly on Major Knox's map of his tour to Hafar in 1906. During a previous tour, in November 1909, I was led to suspect this, but was then unable to locate it accurately. On the present occasion I visited the spot and got bearings which put it at least 10 miles south-east of Knox's position. During his tour, Knox had hired Bedouins who do not appear to have known their country particularly well as some, 1 believe, lost their way on that occasion, and it would seem that Knox must really have been at a place called Thamilat-al-Erbid which he marked as Thamilat-ut-Turki. *2. Al-Hafar wells.'—My bearings and dead-reckoning place these wells 16 miles east and a little north of Knox's position, but in view of the manner in which my route closes on a known point ! am inclined to think my position is the &gt; more accurate. It would also make Knox's marches to and from Hafar more propable as at present they seem (from my experience) extraordinarily long, especially as his camels were hirelings and not particularly good beasts. *3. Bearing of Bat in hollow, —It will be seen that I differ a good deal as to the direction of Al Batin near Hafar from Knox. Unfortunately I had to travel this portion at night, as was the case with Knox also, but our course was steadily kept. It was with ' the North Star in your left eye,' as the Bedouin phrased it and two or three references to the compass showed this to give about 38' to 42' as our direction. *4. Rigai Wells.~~N[y position for these wells is about 10 miles east and a little north of Knox's, For the reasons already given above under, 2,* Hafar wells, I am inclined to prefer mine again. *5, Shiggat-a/- Wasiya. —When fixing the debouchure of this valley I was informed in response to enquiry that it was the only valley debouching into Al Batin from the east, south of Jarishan hill, and found the information to be correct. In previous sketches I believe three such valleys are shown, as well as another position shewn in the secret map of the Intelligence Branch (D. sheet No. 30) scale 2 miles to inch, a blue print, and both would seem to be incorrect. ^ *6. Jarishan Hill. —In the secret map (blue print) last quoted, Jarishan Hill is given as some 9 miles north-east of the position I show on my map, but I am inclined to think that half way between the two would be more correct, especially as I find that the cross distances from Ar Ratk and from Jebel Sanam to Jarishan on Knox's original sketch are within 4 and 5 miles of those shown on mine, and that from Halaiba is almost identical.*7* Ar Ratk ridge. —It was unfortunate that I had to leave my baggage- camels to go on by themselves from Halaiba for some time, for they went off the direct course to the east and I was unable also to gauge how they travelled as accurately as I would have wished. Consequently, I could only estimate 8 miles for the three hours that I was not with them. From the point, where I caught them up and got a bearing to Jebel Sanam, to my camp on Ar Ratk, occupied us i hour 40 minutes which should represent 5 miles, whereas it becomes 7 if south-east. Ar Ratk is accepted as fixed on the secret map 4 miles td the inch (Register No. 914-S. of 1906). On the same assumption my day's march of 7I hours also works out to 24 miles but is probably not more than 21 or 22, I have left the error in my map in the last portion of this day's march (February 21st). •8 and 9. Jahara-Safwan road. —This road is shown as I found it, on the secret Intelligence Branch Map (blue print), but not on the earlier, 4 miles to inch, map of 1906. K uwait ; 3rd April igio. I W. H. I.

I have the honour to refer to the Secretary of State's telegram of the 26th July, calling for evidence demonstrating the control over tribes exercised by Shaikh Mubarak within the limits referred to in Mr. J. G. Lorimer's Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf. 2. A reference to the Political Agent at Kuwait on the subject has been necessary, and on receipt of his reply Government will be addressed by telegraph. Meanwhile I have the honour to state that a careful study of records since 1897 bearing on the question of the limits of the Shaikh's effective influence, inclines me to the view, as I shall proceed to explain, that, if it is still possible to arrange for the adoption of a slight modification of Mr. Lorimer's line, it would be expe dient to do so. I would explain in this connection that both when telegraphing to the Government of India on 26th March igi j and on 6th July 19^2 (No. 690), I was absent from my headquarters and archives and had to reply without reference to them, 3. I may commence by inviting reference to the line which Captain Shakespear indicated, in a report on his tour in the Kuwait hinterland, as being in his opinion the boundary of the principality. It is somewhat less extensive. No. 153 of 23rd March 1910, forwarded to Gov- but to the southwards, 3. good deal more emment of India under Resident's letter No. 977- definite, than that indicated by Mr. Lorimer, dated 14th April 1910. _ t L • e . • 1 upon such scanty information upon the subject as was available to him. It, however, includes Anta'a (Nta'), a group of , , Tr . „ villages of considerable importance, which Vide map of the Kuwait hinterland, Survey of , r o * j India, June 1910.8 miles «=»=i inch. Captain Knox s reports of 1908 give good grounds for regarding as within the domains of Shaikh Mubarak; and the statement of the Porte that it is part of the vilayat of Basrah is presumably on all fours with their claim that Kuwait is also Rifaat Pasha's Memorandum of May 6th, iqo 8, ^ that province. Its headman in I908, at received under Foreign Department endorsement any rate. Was 3l nominee of the Shaikh of No. aigi-E.B., dated 19th June 1908. Kuwait 4. It will be seen that Captain Shakespear also Includes within the limits of Kuwait district, Jazirat 'al Amayir, an island inside Musallamiyah Bay. This No. 138, dated 2sth March 1908, forwarded to is identical with the Bay of Balbul, which Government of India under Resident's letter No, was Hpscribed bv Mr T C GaQldn in hU 1098, dated sth April 1908, and No. 257, dated aescriDeoDy mr. j. u. uasKin, m ms 23rd May 1908,forwarded to Government of India report to the Resident on 6th September under Resident's No. 1814, dated Sth June 1908. 1897, as the Southern Boundary of Kuwait. This report, it would appear, was not forwarded to Government, though an account of the results of Mr. Gaskin's visit, in connection with which the report was made, will be found in Residency letter No, 90 of 20th September 1897 to the Government of India, This testimony, given at a date considerably anterior to our assurances, is of considerable value. It is true that the Political Resident expressed doubts as to the validity of the Shaikh's claim to the island when forwarding it to the Govern-r Resident to Foreign, No. 95, dated 26th April ment of India jn IQQ2, but he gave no I 9 o2 - reasons for doing so, and the fact that the attempt of the Turks made aBout that time to place troops on the island failed, would seem to give us ground to include the island within the principality. There are no Turkish troops on the island at the present time. In making these observations, however, I do not overlook the fact that the view has been expressed by His Majesty's Foreign Office and concurred in by thef India Office that the Shaikh's claims cannot be sustained so far south as lamiyah Bay. I do not know precisely on Foreign office to India Office, dated 16th March , evidence or absence of evidence that 1911, received under Foreign Department endorse- ... . 1 r ^ t rpali^P that it maV nient No. 11S9 -E.A. dated 21st June 1911 (encio- decision is based, but I realise tnat it may ■nre 10), no t be possible at this stage to consider the inclusion of that feature. C The next point after Anta'a mentioned by Captain Shakespear is AI Safah. In a country where water is a precious commodity, to be found only at certain spots, often many miles distant from each other, the inclusion of such wells within the boundaries of a principality is of the greatest importance, and as these wells appear, from Captain Shakespear s report, to be used exclusively by the tribes under Shaikh Mubarak's control and to have at no time been touched by Turkish influence, there seems every ground to include Safah within the prin- cipality. 6. We next come to Hafar. The strategic importance to the Shaikh of Kuwait of this point will be apparent from a glance at the map. It is a half-way house to Buraidah, Riyadh and Hail, and has a constant supply of water. It is a well known outpost, and its possession by Shaikh Mubarak aid the tribes under his control never seems to have been seriously questioned. During the troubles that took place in 1901, he used the place as a rallying pointforhisforce 3 , and claimed it as in his territory, and was greatly incensed with Bin Rashid, who had Indent to Foreign, No. .4, 4.M Jonuar, ^^^^gJaTkh . The latter laid a formal complaint before the Resident of the action of Bin Rashid ii Telegram, Resident to Foreign, dated 2nd Nov- a letter dated 22nd October i^l,^ ember 1901: - extract from which is quoted in the margin. 'Bin Rasbid is at Hafar, wbich is distant 3 The statement regarding Hafar was repeated incidentally in a communication grazing; we have consequently suffered great loss. from the Shaikh tO the KeSlCient CiateCt We, as directed by you, are quite in our own , iVrwPmhpr inOT country and are under the shadow of your protec- 1 7^0 iNOVemDer 19 0 I* tion. It is therefore necessary that Bin Rashid should be made to quit these places, which are in our boundaries. y. From Hafar the boundary line assigned to the Kuwait district alike by Mr. Lorimer and Captain Shakespear is the Batin, a broad low depression in the See Mr. Lorimei '9 Gazetteer, Volume u, page desert, in which water can generally be 281. found at no great depth, and which contains excellent grazing. Beyond it stretches desert, almost uninhabited and quite unfertile. The Batin is a well known and well marked boundary and a tract of great value to Bedouins. There seems no reason to think that it has been inhabited, except spasmodically, by tribes other than those under the influence of the Shaikh of Kuwait. 8. It may be parenthetically remarked here that whereas Mr. Lorimer had to rely upon the word'of the Shaikh for his description of the boundary to the westward, it has now been personally examined by Major Knox and Captain Shakespear, with the results mentioned above, which generally speaking tend to confirm the Shaikh's claims, 9. The position of the northern boundary alone has been subjected in the past to close examination. Captain Shakespear makes the well-marked Ar Ratq Ridge the north-western corner of the principality ; the point seems a suitable one for the purpose and will, I trust, be adopted. Thence it has been held to run through Jabal Sanam, another prominent point, to the sea immediately south of Umm Kasr, 10. The Shaikh's claims to Safwan are, I think a good deal stronger than has generally been thought, and might have been supported with good reason, but it seems probable that as regards this point we are committed vts d vis the Porte to recognise it as beyond the limits of Kuwait; the Shaikh's influence, however, is without doubt unquestioned up to the walls of the fort at Safwan and this fact should receive recognition when the boundary is fixed. Mr. J. C. Gaskin in his repoit of tth September 1897 gives Safwan as the northern boundary of the principality and it has altvays been a camping ground of his tribes. HisMajesty's Consul, Basrah, reported in 1902* that in his opinion the Turkish Government never thought of exercising authority over either Safwan or „ ^„ Umm Kasr until recent events. The w Telegram from Consul, Basrah, to Anibassa- 4.^ C f • i i • dor, No. 2i f daied 25th February 1902. ohcUkn S Cl3.ini to o3tW3.n IS rCCOruSQ in a letter to the Resident dated 7th Feb ruary 1902! and he further said to the Senior Naval Officer who interrogated t Regarding Safwan, the crops of him on the subject, that there were 8 or train produced there are under my authority and lO families of Sedentary Bin Hanedi and Bin Tarki there, who had lived there Before now the Turks or others had not laid their permanently for 40 years. 1 hey paid him hand on Safwan. ^ n0 re g U | ar tribute, he said, but supplied him from time to time with grass and onions as a recognition of their subordina tion to him. 11. When discussing with me, a month ago, various newspaper reports suggesting that the Baghdad Railway was likely to find its terminus at Umm Kasr, under the segis of Turkey, Shaikh Mubarak made it evident that he felt strongly on the subject of that point and emphatically claimed it as his own possession. Probably in reality his claim has as much validity as those of the Turks who, previous to 1901, had never shown any interest in the place. But His Majesty's Government have decided 10 years ago that they would not support his claim to this outpost and I presume that they will not alter that decision now in any case; fortunately the place loses much of its strategical value if Warba and Bubyan are retained by the Shaikh. In regard to these islands we have, 1 think, every reason to insist on the Shaikh's rights, both on their instrinsic merits and as a matter of political expediency. Major Knox's reports on the rights of the Shaikh and his tribesmen in regard to them were submitted to Government in 1908—2;^ enclosure to Gov ernment of India Despatch No. 168 Secret—External, dated 10th September 1908. 12. As regards other islands, I presume His Majesty's Government will be able to provide for the recognition of the Shaikh's ownership, or at all events his predominance, in those mentioned by Mr. Lorimer. 13. There remain one or two other points not directly referred to in the Secretary of State's telegram under reply, to which I would invite reference. Firstly, 1 presume that the phrase ' town, harbour and immediate surroundings' used in India Office telegram dated 1st July, includes the whole of Kuwait Bay from Sabiyah to Ras-al-Ardh, together with Jahrah, the possession of which is a vital necessity to the Shaikh. In this connection I would invite reference to the Military Report on Kuwait, 1903, by Captain h. marginally noted Military Report, which h. Lowding, i.b .india, pages 22.23. describes very well the attitude of the Shaikh to the possession of Jahrah and the importance of its retention in connec tion with our Kadhamah concession. 14. The conclusion to which the considerations set forth in the foregoing paragraphs bring me, subject to confirmation or modification, on receiving the report which 1 await from Captain Shakespear, is-that if it is still possible as between ourselves and the Turks, to work in a slightly different line to that des cribed by Mr. Lorimer, it will be both in the interest of the Shaikh and at the same time more palatable to the Turks, if we can arrange for recognition of the line (subject to the slight modifications mentioned below) indicated by Captain Shakespear; which, while conceding a broad strip of territory to Turkey, effec tively safeguards the Shaikh's rights and influence over his tribes at strategic points and at the same time has the substantial advantage of affording a well defined frontier, a consideration which the Shaikh will, I have no doubt, appreciate. 15. The modification which I recommend is that the boundary on the coast should be arbitrarily held to be at Jabal Manifah and from thence to proceed south-west to include Anta'a and thence along Captain Shakespear's boundary via A1 Safah, Hafar and Al Batin as indicated on the accompanying copy of the most recent map. In order to save time I have sent a copy of this communication to His Majesty's India Office. G. C. B. P., Simla.-No. C 50 F. D.-14-8-/2.—44—C. G.

With reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign Department No. 10i. dated 6th March 1912, and enclosuree. ? 0 ' ^ 1911, 1 venture with the highest respect to lay before Government a further report from the Political Agent at Kuwait on the subject of the needs of that port in the direction of postal facility. 2. In their communication above cifei the Government of India accepted the view of the Post Office authorities that the postal work performed at Kuwait was very light and that even the modest facilities now afforded entailed considerable loss on the postal department. I cannot but think that a perusal of the present report will enable the Government of India and the Director General of the Post Office to modify their conclusions in regard to both these bearings of the question. 3. As to the extent of extra labour devolving on the 2nd Clerk of the Agency, the Foreign Department will now have before them incidentally the conclusions arrived at independently by Mr. J. B. 'Wood, C.I.E., who has lately paid a visit of inspection to the Kuwait Agency; while as to the business aspect of the project, the figures, presented by Captain Shakespear seem difficult to reconcile with conditions involving considerable loss. At least it would appear that the postal business which would fall to a fully fledged Post Office in Kuwait would be sufficient to enable the institution to pay its way. 4. It remains to consider the present aspect of the proposal to substitute a formal British Post Office for the unofficial arrangement of the past, from the political point of view. In this regard I am not unmindful of the misgivings entertained by His Majesty's Embassy as late as the date of Mr. Marling's despatch of 21st December 1910 to His Majesty's Foreign Office, but since then the atmosphere has apparently cleared; the text of our Postal Agreement with Shaikh Mubarak has in fact been communicated to the Porte with the Foreign Office Note of 24!th October 1911 to the Ottoman Ambassador. I trust, therefore, that as soon as the state of the negotiations now in pro gress with the Turkish Government admits of the change politically, the Govern ment of India will see their way to proceed with it.

It is with some diffidence that I venture to revert to the subject in view of the decision of Government previously expressed, but the matter has now assumed such importance that in the interests of the community and of our own political and commercial position in Kuwait I am constrained to plead for a reconsideration of the project. 3. I have attached hereto a tabular statement and an explanatory memo randum in an endeavour to show by figures the enormous increase in the postal4 business of the port. The figures of actuals cover 26 consecutive months and have been carefully cheeked This check led to the discovery of some errors in the statement forwarded with my letter No. 180 of the 15th April 19 m i i» however do not affect the conclusions then reached. I venture to submit that the figures showing the increases per centum for each period over that P re o e ^- ing are Sufficiently striking in themselves to warrant fully my assert,on that there has been an enormous increase in the postal work done by my office establishment. 4. From letter No. 2036.Est, A., dated the 10th July 1911. from the Gov ernment of India in thePoreign Department, to your address I gather that the postal authorities consider the work at Kuwait extremely light and that its execution already entails a loss to the Post Office. So far as I am aware th s 1, a,,. Pnst Office onlv Es. 240 per annum (the salary of the postal ptJUJUL) auu ouuiv Wi ^e'^aSairittc^sR;. ^5^ ™ I confess that, without further figures not available to me, the loss seems inexplicable in present cir- work costs the Post Office only Ks. 240 per annum (thesalaryoiu.e postal peon) and some of the time of the Postmaster at Bushire the rest of it being performed by mv head clerk without remuneration. When the sale of post- age labels at further figui cumstances. 5. There remains the consideration of the political reasons for which I understand the project of a regular post office in Kuwait was m the maia negatived. My office is treated by the local public exactly as a post office, there is a special room for the work, and the usual red letter-box hxed m a wall so that to all outward appearance there is already a post office, ana that this impression prevails in Basrah and elsewhere there seems to be no doubt. The formal opening of a regular post office would not attract particular notice, whether notification to the International Bureau would be remarked upon and noticed by the Ottoman Government in any seriously preiudicial manner cannot be foretold with any certainty, but nothing beyond a formal protest, and perhaps some of the usual allegations of the anti-British press m Con stantinople, appears likely. On the other hand British protests m defence of Shaikh Mubarak's rights do not appear hitherto to have met with such atten tion as to make us sensitive to Turkish susceptibilities. Moreover we have carried on the postal work in Kuwait now for over seven years, and presumably would not regard with equanimity its transfer to any other hands. Further the settlement of the American Mission, the increase in trade, the continual growth of the town and its commercial prosperity make the matter of urgent importance as affecting our predominent share in its trade. 6. On the merits of the proposal itself with the data available and sub mitted herewith I would plead for a re-consideration of the subject with the recommendation that the Post Office, should the Government of India see their way to establishing one, may be an Indian inland office similar to that at Bahrain. 7. In this letter I have not adverted to a former proposal with regard to the retention of my second clerk for the work if a regular post office should still be found infeasible, for the reason that (though my office work together with the postal work will be beyond the capabilities of one head clerk) it is now of far more importance than formerly in the commercial interests of the town that a regular post office should be established without delay.Sub-Enclosure 2. Memorandum on postal work done at Political Agency&gt; Kuwait, Attention is invited to the attached tabular statement as showing at a glance the very great increase in postal business in Kuwait. The first part of the statement gives the actual figures for three periods of 4 months, 11 months and 11 months respectively, but a better comparison is furnished by the latter half in which these actual figures have been expanded into the form of annual averages. 2. Column («) of the statement gives the outward money-order business and it is worth noting that the figures represent only those money-orders booked on behalf of the Agency Staff, as no money-orders are accepted from the general public, though the office is continually being asked to book them. A regular post office would do an immense amount of business in this branch as I believe is the case at all other Persian Gulf post offices especially at those on the Arab Coast. 3. The same remarks apply to outward parcels business. 4. The increase in inward money-orders, parcels and registered articles is enormous (4)35, 173 and 130 percent in eleven months respectively). It is this work particularly which takes so much of the time of my office establish ment from its legitimate work ; payments have to be made, receipts obtained and accounts furnished weekly to the Bushire Post Office. 5. It has not been possible to take account of tbe inward letters, but the increase judging roughly by quantity has been on the same scale. A count of a few outward mails gave an average of 227 letters a week, that is some 12,000 per annum. A large number, however, are posted on board steamers to obtain a lower rate of postage and are not included in these figures. Although not all the stamps affixed to outward letters are actually bought in Kuwait there has been a heavy increase of 119 per cent in the last eleven months in the stamps sold to the public. Another column, that for overdue and bearing postage recovered, for which unfortunately I have no previous figures, serves to give an idea of how heavy the inward mail must be, when no less than Us. 94 is recovered in eleven months on this account alone. 6. So much for the figures available which it would be interesting to com pare with other Gulf ports. Lingah would furnish the best comparison as having, like Kuwait, an insignificant through post to other places in the interior. On the score of population however, Kuwait, with at least 40,000 inhabitants as against some 12,000 in Lingah, would seem likely to furnish a better return on the necessary expenditure of a post office. Moreover, the town is growing, trade is increasing and as the amenities of civilization become better appreciated, the need of ordinarily free postal facility becomes more and more urgent. The recent establishment of a branch of Ihe American Mission, with three Europeans resident in Kuwait makes that need more than ever apparent. During the last four months (November to February) the increase in the inward mail has been remarkable, over 1,000 parcels, over Rs. 1,700 in money- orders and over 1,200 ^ registered articles having been received; these figures show no signs of remaining stationary, much less of diminution, and urgently proclaim the insistent want of a regular post office. 7. If the figures given above and in the attached statement are those obtainable from and in spite of the work being carried on in an office which by its nature cannot undertake any of the revenue-paying business of the post office, how much more is the establishment of a regular post office likely to expand postal business and revenue, especially if the present Union rates are lowered to the inland Indian rates prevailing at Maskat and Bahrain.

I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with my letter No. C -47, dated the 10th June 1912, reporting the efforts of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company to obtain a permanent footing in Kuwait. 2. I am informed by the Shaikh that after his return to Kuwait he was one day approached by Alexander Forage, a Baghdadj Christian in the employ of Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company, who recently returned to Kuwait , with a request for a confidential interview. After some ordinary conversation, similar to that already reported requesting permission for the firm to establish a European agent in Kuwait, the talk drifted to politics with special reference to the Baghdad Railway. According to the Shaikh, Forage first enquired as to the ownership of Um Kasr, saying that the terminus of the railway would probably be located at that point. 1 he reply was that Um Kasr had belonged to the As-Subah for many years, that the present fort there was actually built by Shaikh Jabir (the grandfather of Mubarak) for the protection of the wells and such Kuwaitis as their business took to that region. Forage questioned the Shaikh being able to maintain this claim in view of the fact that a Turkish detachment actually occupied the fort. The Shaikh's reply was that his boundaries to the north were and had been for generations from the Batin depression near the Ar-Ratk ridge eastwards to Jabal Sanam, Safwan and thence to Um Kasr and the sea. The Turks had p aced these small detachments in Safwan, Um Kasr and Bubiyan only some eight or nine years ago after they discovered that an aggression contemplated by them on Kuwait itself would not be permitted by the English; but the occupation of a place by half-a-dozen soldiers for eight years couM scarcely be held to abrogate the As-Subah's rights which had existed for generations. Further that even now should any raid be made within the boundaries named, redress was always demanded from and obtained through Mubarak as the recognised ruler of the territory in which the raid had taken place. Of course if the Turks intended to seize the place by force that was another matter; and if their intention should be to make the place of importance without consulting him, he would certainly assert his rights in a manner suffi ciently forcible to leave no doubt as to his claims. He would have done so before but for the fact thatf the place was of small value at the time of the Turkish oc cupation and certainly not worth risking the possible consequences of a forci ble opposition at that time to the weight of the whole Ottoman Government. 4. In parenthesis I would here observe that the Shaikh's claim to the line which he describes as his northern boundary is, to my own personal knowledge, justified by the terrain, in so much that, if a recognizable natural boundary can be said to exist in a desert, one certainly is traceable along the line indicated. Also, that Arabs whether Bedouin or townsmen invariably do apply to Mubarak for redress if looted or molested within (that is—to the south of) this line. Further, that to this day the garrisons in Safwan and Um Kasr have continued to exist only on sufferance.2 4. Forage then suggested to the Shaikh that if he was willing to lease or sell any part of his territory to the German Railway Company he could easily be assured undisputed possession of Safwan, Um Kasr and Bubiyan, for the German Emperor was much interested in the Railway and his word carried great weight at Constantinople. Forage had no doubt that if the Shaikh com plained of the Turkish occupation of these points, the German Emperor would soon cause them to be evacuated. The Railway Company wanted to obtain a site on the seaboard for their terminus and vtere prepared to give the Shaikh what he liked to ask for the lease or sale of a suitable place. He went on to expatiate on the advantages and profits which would accrue to the Shaikh from the advent of a great railway, the increase of trade and consequent improvement of customs revenues, etc. After more of the same nature the Shaikh observed that the conversation seemed to have drifted a long way from Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co 's desire to open a branch agency of their business in Kuwait town and savoured more of what might be expected from a diplomatic envoy rather than a plain merchant. To this Forage replied that he was merely concerned to show the Shaikh how he could profit himself, avoid losses and assure his position and that the talk had been with quite disinterested motives where it went beyond the firm's own request. 5. I have reported the story in some detail as it was given to me by the Shaikh himself, and though he may have added embellishments in order to inflate his own importance in our eyes, the fact remains that he has been approached more or less openly in German interests at a time when negotiations are ostensibly in progress only between the British and Turkish Governments, and that an effort is being made to obtain a definite claim to some suitable or possible site for a railway terminus. I would add that any news regarding the Baghdad Railway, allocation of its capital, discussion of possible sites for a terminus, etc. is sought and discussed diligently and keenly by all the better educated in the town and by none with more ^cumen than the Shaikh. p.

TELEGRAM, dated the 10th instant, to folio wing effect received from resident, Persian Gulf:— ' Following is reported by political agent, Koweit:— ' ' A certain Alexander Forage, a Bagdad Christian in Messrs. Wonckhaus's employ ment, recently approached the Sheikh of Koweit, and, after reverting to request previously made that European agent should be appointed, referred to the Bagdad Railway, and asked to whom sheikh considered that Um Kasr (which he said would probably become terminus) belonged. t '' Sheikh in reply claimed, on grounds previously advanced, that Um Kasr belonged to himself; he also said that he should at once take forcible steps to assert his right, if there was any idea of the place being used without his consent for the important purpose mentioned. Sheikh claimed that Jabal Sanam, Safwan, Um Kasr, and thence to the sea were included in his boundary. To this Forage replied that possession of Um Kasr, Bubiyan, and Safwan could easily be assured to shiekh, if he^would lease or sell any part of his territory to German railway company, as evacuation of those places by Turks would soon be arranged by German Emperor, who was much interested in the matter. Forage went on to say that sheikh would be given his own price for sale or lease of site on seaboard, which was what railway company wanted. The sheikh claims that he brought the conversation to an end by remarking that business of Forage seemed to be not so'much that of a plain merchant desiring to open a trade agency as that of a diplomatic envoy. , , , , j u ji ' ' Political agent in conclusion expresses the view that sheikh has undoubtedly been approached more or less openly in interests of Germany, though story may have been somewhat embellished by him with a view to enhancing his own importance. ' ' In view of the above incident, and of references that have recently appeared m Arabic newspapers, sheikh is now anxious to be furnished with news, if there is any, as to developments of railway question. He has repeatedly said that j^e relies on us to keep him informed on this subject.' [254'&gt; m—3]* ' 1 /w Memorandum.

CONFIDENTIAL. [July 18.] S ection 1. l28322T No - Sir Edward Grey to Tewfik Pasha. (Confidential.) Your Highness, Foreign Office, July 18, 1012. I HAVE the honour to transmit to your Highness herewith a meraorandum embodying the reply of His Majesty's Government to the memorandum communicated . by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the l_5th April last, relating to questioned 1 , connected with the Bagdad Hail way and the Persian Gulf. In communicating this document to your Highness I desire to call your attention to two additional points which are not dealt with in the memorandum or its annexes. In the first place His Majesty's Government consider it highly desirable, in order to secure the smooth working of the arrangements proposed m regard r,o the Bagdad Railway, that at least one British director, approved by His Majesty's Government, should be admitted to the board of the Bagdad Railway Company. Such an arrangement would of course require the consent of the German Government. i Secondly, as the Turkish Government are aware, certain rights are secured to Persia under the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), and the geographical position of Mohammerah is such that the sheikh cannot fail to be brought into contact with the Riverain Commission; and unless provision is made for these facts there is a risk of the friction arising wMch it is the object of the two Governments to avoid. There would have been much to be said for an International Riverain Commission on which Persia, equally with Great Britain and Turkey, should be represented. But as His Majesty's Government, appreciating the objections entertained by the Porte, have not pressed tor this, it is necessary to provide in some other way for the representation of Persia m such matters as may touch her rights whether under the Treaty of Erzeroum or under this new agreement. His Majesty's Government therefore propose that the commissioner who is a British subject should be charged with the duty of making to the comimssion such representations as may at any time be necessary upon any question atiectmg those rights, and they will be willing to use their good offices with the Persian Government *and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to agree to this arrangement. These two points come, perhaps, outside the scope of the matters dealt with m the memorandum which are confined to subjects of negotiation between Great Britain and Turkey alone, but His Majesty's Government attach great importance to them and trust that they will receive the favourable consideration of the Imperial Ottoman Government. j havei &amp;c . E. GREY. Enclosure in No. 1. Draft of Memorandum to he communicated to Turkish Ambassador. 1 HIS Majesty's Government have not failed to examine with much care and attention the important proposals which are embodied in the memorandum communicated . . i -r • 1 r\-r\ 4-V*o 1 A TYPl I I jfo atbtMiblUli uiit, wi A •11 J bv the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last. . . , , 2 Throughout their deliberations, His Majesty's Government have been animated by the conviction that a complete agreement on outstanding questions is eminently to be desired in the larger interests of both countries. They are persuaded that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, hut also in its cumulative [2546 s—1] B T ■fj-X and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty s Govern ment therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals and considerations :— Draft Con- (a.) An arrangement, as set forth in the accompanying draft convention, for the vention exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey. (Annex 2). ^.) The admission of two British representatives, approved by His Majesty's Government, to the board of whatever company may undertake the construction or working of the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah. (c.) The terminus of the railway to be at Bussorah. (cL) No railway to be continued beyond Bussorah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty's Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. Draft Con- (e.) A convention to be signed, on the basis of the accompanying _ draftfor the vention future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. This convention must be read in conjunction (Annex 3). w ^h the accompanying memorandum (Annex No. 5) on the subject of the frontier of Mohammerah. (/.) Permission to be given for three British steamers to navigate between Bagdad and Bussorah in addition to the number already allowed. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. 7. His Majesty's Government note with satisfaction that the Turkish Government renounce their claims to Bahrein on conditions which there should be no difficulty in accepting, but they have learnt with disappointment the attitude of the Imperial Ottoman Government in regard to El Katr and Koweit; nevertheless they do not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the important sacrifice made by TFor convenience of reference the several proposals nnder consideration may be dealt with under three distinct headings :— $ s: »,«..... ^ .f .h. Persian Gulf. _ . (hi.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. 4. The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse a region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total exports ,md imports is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty s Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner m which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-halt centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah; they have recalled that no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Bussorah was British ; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement ot t ^ e Bagdad Railway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties. i 1 . •, j • 11 5. The magnitude of Great Britain's^ manifold interests clearly renders it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section o the Bagdad Railway should, if possible^be reached. His Majesty s Government imd, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is hkely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circum stances His Majesty's Government, anxious to prove to the Ottoman Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive understanding without delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation m the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah, If a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the other points enumerated in this memorandum. 6. It would be impossiBle to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty's Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. His Majesty's Government consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the following conditions as essential to that end :—His Majesty's Government in the matter of British participation in the Bagdad Railway, and that they will meet that sacrifice by a corresponding modification of the views set forth in the Turkish memorandum of the 15th April. 8. His Majesty's Government must in the first instance protest against the con tention that there is a misunderstanding with regard to the assurance given, and 0 repeatedly given, to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. 9. The original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office, and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy. 10. His Majesty's Government maintain that prior to Midhat Pasha's expedition there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish jurisdiction or occupation, effective or ineffective. And while they are now prepared to recognise Annex 4. Turkish sovereignty between the southernmost limits of Koweit (as hereinafter defined) and Ojeir, they are unable to admit that any of the arguments adduced in the Turkish memorandum in any way invalidates the statement that south of Ojeir, in the district ■of El Katif, there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; and they are lully persuaded that El Katr has never been locally regarded as forming part of. or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire. For themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the Turkish assurances mentioned above, they have never so regarded it, and they have repeatedly informed the Sublime Porte accordingly. 11. His Majesty's Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by ihe Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula ot El Katr, including El Bidaa. They have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itself so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition. 12. The Turkish memorandum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty's •Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation •of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Koweit. His Majesty's . Government are concerned to ensure the continuance of the local government of the o , ■Sheikh of Koweit, as defined in their memorandum of the 29th July, 1911. Further, P J His Majesty's Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty 1 \ over Koweit and indeed to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they w attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being 1 admitted by j^; emo Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, to the withdrawal of the Turkish military randum post from Bubiyan, and to a recognition of the limits of Koweit in accordance with (Annex 4). the indications contained in the accompanying memorandum. 13. His Majesty's Government regret that they would consider the introduction of divided responsibility for maritime police measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their policy in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the system in these circumstances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed His Majesty's Government would go further. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf; they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative ; and it was this attitude which led to the declaration made by the Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that 'His Majesty's Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal.' His Majesty's Government must therefore ask the Turkish Government to recognise in the Persian Gulf the right of Great Britain—(a.) To control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; [h.) To police its waters; and (c.) To conduct all quarantine arrangements. 15. In submitting these final proposals for the acceptance of the Turkish Govern ment, His Majesty's Government are not seeking territorial aggrandisement, nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simply to secure the recognition and to ensure the continuance of an order of things which, in fact, grew up under their auspices and before the appearance of Turkish authority in the Persian Gulf, and which has been proved by experience to favour the developmentV of trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual pir y u e X6. They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government will not oppose the continuance of the political stains quo of a hundred years, ^ d ^ e y confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the improved ^ relations which cannot fail to ensue. . „ w u- v paused 17. As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a q l ' estl ' n ^ some concern to His Majesty's Government ^recent months, that ® between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah. When His Majesty s Government addressed their memorandum of July 1911 to the ^ that question had been dormant for sixty years, and His aje 7 , bevond no desire to raise it. Now however that it has been raised, by S their control, they feel that no settlement m the Persian Gulf J? which did not provide for this question, and th .% re g arda to it as an essential part of the present negotiations. Piey Ottoman Sum submit a se P al ' ate memorandum on the subject for the consideration of the Ottoman (Annex 5). Government. (iii.) Aii increase in the Turkish customs duties. 18. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to conclude an agreement in the sense of this memorandum, and to concur in the removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt, then, subject to the assent of the other Powers, Mis Maiesty's Government will consent to the maintenance for a period of seven years, counting from six months after the date of such agreement, of the increase m the general rate of customs duty leviable on British goods on importation into the Ottoman Empire from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, ad valorem which was agreed to m 1907, and also to the further increase of this general rate of customs duty from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem for the same period. Foreign Office, July 18, 1912. ANNEX 1. HIS Majesty's Government wish to mention a question to which they attach great importance, but to which they have not referred m this memorandum. His Majesty's Government desire to secure that the duties leviable upon certain classes of cotton yarns and manufactures shall in no case exceed certain rates to be agreed upon. • i ^ i His Majesty's Government will furnish the Ottoman Government, with the least possible delay, with a schedule specifying these classes of goods and the duties to be applied to them.

ANNEX 3. Draft Convention for the Establishment of a Shatt-el-Arab Navigation Commission. THE Government of His Britannic Majesty and the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan of Turkey, being desirous on account of the magnitude of their interests in the trade on the Shatt-el-Arab to improve the navigation of that river, and to diminish the risks to which commerce thereon is exposed, have agreed as follows:— : 1. The navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain open to the ships of all nations. j q 2.

The Commission shall be charged with the followins: duties (a.) The execution of such works as may be necessary for the improvement of the channel of the river and of the approaches thereto on the seaward side. (b.) The maintenance of the channel of the river free from obstructions of all sorts, so as to keep it in the best possible state for navigation. . (c.) The preparation, issue, and enforcement of regulations for the navigation of the river and for the policing of the river and the land and buildings held by the Commission. (d.)

The Imperial Ottoman Government undertakes to facilitate the acquisition by the Commission of such land as the Commission shall consider necessary to enable^ it to carry out effectually the duties assigned to it. The cost of such land shall be paid by the Commission. In cases where land to which fishing rights are attached is required by the Commission, no unnecessary interference with such fishing rights shall take place. 8. No dues, taxes, or charges shall be levied either by the Porte or by the Commission on ships or. goods on the Shatt-el-Arab based on the mere fact of navigation. 9. The Commission shall have the sole right to levy any dues or charges that may be found necessary to cover the expenses of works undertaken and services maintained by it. In the event of such dues being found necessary they shall not exceed the amount reasonably required for the above purposes, including the administration of the Commission, and their produce shall be exclusively applied thereto, any surplus being devoted to the reduction of dues. In no case shall the rate of dues excaed 1 fr. per net registered ton of shipping, 10. Any dues or charges levied by the Commission shall be levied impartially and equitably in respect of all vessels, whatever be the places from or to which they arrive or depart, or the nations or persons to which the vessels or their cargoes belong.

Koweit. HIS Majesty's Government consider the frontier on the north to be a line running from Khor-as-Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and bafwam to Jabal Sanan and thence to the Batin. On the south his boundary is considered to run eastwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to the Na'airiyah hill at the north-western corner of Eadaif On the west the Shaikhdom is bounded between Jabal Sanam and Hafar by the Batin, and south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Summan from Dahanah as far south as the point where that line is intersected by the route from Wabrah to Eiyadh. Districts and Islands. The Shaikbdom, considered from the physical point of' view, falls naturally into two parts, one to the north and the other to the south .?f,.a line joining Koweit town and Riqai. In the northern block lie the districts or tracts of Batin, Shiqqaq, Eatih, Umm-al-Khilan, Yah, Qira-al-Marru, Zaqlah, and Zor. The southern block comprises the three great divisions of Summan, Dibdibah, and Ummj Janaib ; and the last, which lies along the coast to the south of Koweit Bay, is further subdivided into districts named Shaqq, l^ra'ab Adan, Salu, Hazaim, and Sudah. The maritime possessions of Koweit consist of the islands of Bubiyan, Warba, and Failakah, which, with its northern and southern outliers of Mashjan and 'Auhah, is situated at the mouth of Koweit Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar, Qaru and Umm-al- Maradim. A map is enclosed showing the limits of Koweit. ANNEX 5. Mohammerah Frontier. HIS Majesty's Government have already informed the Imperial Ottoman Govern- | ment of the great importance which they attach to the maintenance of the frontier | status quo, as locally observed, in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. His Majesty's Government now have the honour to explain their views in greater detail, and they would preface their statement by observing that they have not only re-examined all the evidence, both oral and documentary, which was laid before the [2546 s—1] j)conference of Erzeroum, but they have also had recourse to the great store of information collected by the well-known savant Major (afterwards Sir Henry) Rawlinson, who was well acquainted with the country, and made a profound study of the territorial position in the Mohammerah region, based upon historical facts and the deeds of title relating to each particular plot of land. Moreover, much information, which was not at the disposal of the Commissioners at Erzeroum, has been traced m the voluminous records of the East India Company, who carried oa direct trade with Bussorah from the year 1635. These records are especially illuminating m regard to the conditions which actually prevailed on the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab during the 17th and 18th centuries. . , in The accompanying maps indicate the line of the frontier as it has been local y observed for a century or more. For facility of reference, the line may be tollowed, firstlv, from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where it strikes the Chatt el-Arab, and, secondly, along the course of that river until it reaches the sea. By reference to the accompanying map No. 1, the village of bnuaib wili be observed at a point 15f miles on a bearing of 8 degrees north of west from Hawizeh . it is a settled village of the Beni Salih, containing some 500 inhabitants living m permanent dwellings. The whole country, comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu'aib, and Kuskh-i-Basri, is regularly occupied and cultivated by-the tribes of Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, who are not nomadic, m the ordinary sense of the term, but are settled inhabitants. These tribes, who exclusively inhabit, and where possible cultivate, the triangular tract above referred to, have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh, which has been a recognised district of the Persian province of Khuzistan or Arabistan for, at any rate, four centuries. They pay revenue to their tribal sheikhs, who formerly passed it on in tribute to the ' Maula ' ruler of Hawizeh, who in turn paid it to the Persian Government, but, since 1902, this tribute has been collected through the agency of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. To the eastward of the marsh on which the village of Shu'aib is situated, and southwards, as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction, nor of Turkish status. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf has recently visited the Hawizeh district, and his investigations have served to confirm the information which His Majesty's Government already possessed. Apart from the sheikhs and tribesmen of the Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, Sir Percy Cox came in contact with many old inhabitants who could speak with long experience in regard to the territorial status quo. The view universally expressed as to the frontier was as follows :—- &lt;^1. That whatever is the western boundary of the Hawizeh is, ipso facto, the frontier of Persia: in other words, that the Hawizeh district is included within the -confines of Persia. 2. That the 'Hawizeh district' comprises those lands which are regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes belonging to it, and paying revenue to Persia. 3. That, on the above premises, the boundary locally recognised is that shown by a green line on map No. 1. It will be noticed that the line (which is formed by the edge of the marsh, and is thus a natural frontier), after crossing the Ghor-el-Azem, eventually cuts the main channel of the marsh just west of Shu'aib, continues in a southerly direction until it reaches a point due west of Kuskh-i-Basri, whence it breaks back to that place, and then proceeds direct to the Shatt-el-Arab at Di'aiji. The reason why Kuskh-i-Basri is recognised as an angle of the boundary is referable to the existence of a winter lake of rain water at Yafair.; the limit of cultivation and occupation by tribesmen under Hawizeh in this direction is regulated by the distance from their water supply (Yafair), at which they can safely dwell and keep their flocks, and this limit is considered to be reached at Kuskh-i-Basri, where the ruins of an extensive building of great age form a convenient landmark. His Majesty's Government, being in possession of precise and trustworthy information regarding the frontier of Hawizeh, have no occasion to appeal to more uncertain authorities, but they think it is not without interest to recaU to the Imperial Ottoman Government that Dervish Pasha, whose estimates of Turkish claims were not usually marked by excessive moderation, admits in Chapter XHI of his book (printed in Constantinople in 1868), ' that it would be hardly right ' for the Ottoman Government to lay claim to the country of Hawizeh, though, in the subsequent chapter, his Excellency expresses the view that it ' might be useful ' for Turkey to claim it as9 a pretext for proposing something else, viz., that the Kerkha should be adopted as the boundary above Sheria. Coming now to the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab, the frontier as locally observed enters the Khaiyin Canal (which is the name of the channel running from the Turkish Customs Post at Di'aiji, between the islands of Kbarnubiyah, Bowarin, and Aqawat, to the junction of the Nahr Nazaileh with the main stream) at a point between the Nahr Di'aiji and the Nahr Abul Arabid; it follows the middle of the Nahr Khaiyin until it reaches the point where the Nahr Khaiyin and the Nahr Nazaileh meet the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab. (See map No. 2.) It then proceeds, as shown by the broken black line (see accompanying maps Nos. 3 and 4), along the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, in mid-stream, until that river reaches the Persian Gulf. The claim made by Persia rests on continued and undisturbed possession for over a century, and on the recognition of Persian sovereignty by local representatives of the Turkish Government in many ways and on many different occasions. Thus there is unanimity of evidence amongst the local tribesmen that the boundary as locally observed has not been questioned by the Turkish authorities, who, on the contrary, many years ago had actually buried some coal in a pit as a permanent boundary mark; and it further appears that the periodical cleaning of the Nahr Khaiyin has always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whilst the cleaning of the Di'aiji Canal' has been carried out exclusively under the orders of the Turkish mudirs. The local inhabitants moreover draw a very clear line of distinction between the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in, for instance, the islands of Akawat, Barin or Bowarin, Shamshamiyah, and Umm-ut-Tuwaileh, of the greater part of which he is merely proprietor, and his position on the Persian side of the locally recognised boundary. From the point where the locally observed frontier leaves the Khaiyin Canal and, opposite the Nahr Nazaileh, enters the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, it follows the medium filum aquce of the Shatt-el-Arab down to the Persian Gulf. (See maps Nos. 3 and 4.) This line of demarcation is in accordance with the general presumption that, where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous States, the middle of the channel or ' thalweg ' is the actual line of separation between those two States. Such a presumption may, however, be swept away, either by proof of prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession on the part of one of the two States, or by express treaty stipulation. The records of the past 300 years, as contained in the official archives of the East India Company and of His Majesty's Government, are far from supporting any claim on the part of Turkey to ' prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession ' of the Shatt-el-Arab ; while no express stipulation is contained in the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) as to the ownership of the river. If, therefore, His Majesty's Government had strict regard either to purely local considerations or to the letter of the treaties, they would not hesitate to press for the frontier as locally recognised along its whole length from Hawizeh to the Persian Gulf. But they prefer to look at the negotiations in which they are now engaged as a whole, and are sincerely anxious to arrive at an arrangement which both parties can accept ex ammo, and which, by removing all points of grievance and friction not only between themselves, but also between the Sublime Porte and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, will place the relations of all concerned on a thoroughly satisfactory footing. Provided, therefore, the Turkish Government will accept the frontier status quo as already indicated from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where the Khaiyin Canal and the Nahr Nazaileh enter the Shatt-el-Arab, then His Majesty's Government are prepared to use their influence with the Persian Govern ment and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to recognise Turkish sovereignty over the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, subject to the following conditions :— (i.) The following islands to be recognised as within the territorial limits of Persia:— (a.) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh, the four islands situated between Shatait and Ma'awiyeh, and the two islands off Manquhi. These islands are in fact parts of the island of Abadan, and must be so regarded. (b.) Any islands now in existence, or which may hereafter be formed, and which may be connected at low water either with Abadan Island or with the Persian bank below the Nahr Nazaileh.10 (ii.) The arrangements proposed by His Majesty's Government for maintaining full freedom of navigation on the river, and for its conservancy, to be accepted by the Ottoman Government. . . (iii.) The modem port and anchorage of Mohammerah, which is m the mam stream of the Shatt-el-Arab above and below its junction with the Karun, to be lecognised as within Persian jurisdiction. (See Map No. 2.) ^ (iv.) No interference to take place with existing fishing rights and usages on or from the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, that phrase being understood to comprise all land on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab or on the Persian islands therein which is uncovered at normal low tide. (v.) Turkish jurisdiction not to extend to land on the Persian bank, defined as above, which is only temporarily covered with water in time of flood ^ or from any accidental cause, and Persian jurisdiction not to extend to land which is temporarily or accidentally uncovered below normal low-water mark. (vi.) The Sheikh of Mohammerah to continue in full enjoyment of his existing 'proprietary rights in lands situated in Turkish territory.on this subject the under-mentioned letter and number may he quoted, and the reply addressed to— The Under Secretary of State for India, India Office, Whitehall, London, S.

We are, however, advised by Emin Bey that he has recently learned from an influential source in Constantinople that, after twice interviewing the authorities, Mr. Carter has been unsuccessful in his application. On the other hand, he assures us that there is no local opposition in the way of our application, and that it receives great favour from influential members of the Young Turkish party, who much prefer the introduction of British capital to that of any other foreign country.

India Office to Foreign Office.—[Received June 29.) ^ r ' . India Office, June 28, 1912. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the letter of this Office, dated the 21st June, 1912, communicating copy of the telegram of the (govern ment of India, dated the 20th idem, regarding British participation in the Persian Gulf section of the Bagdad Railway and other matters, and in reply to offer the following observations :— Attention is invited to the fact that views have now formally been expressed by the Government of India in favour of British participation in the Persian Gulf section to the extent of 50 per cent. This matter has been already dealt with in my letters of the 21st May and the 10th June, 1912. Similarly, as regards the territorial questions referred to in the telegram, I am to call attention to what was said in mv letter of the 18th June, 1912. The question of the specification attached to the Bagdad Railway convention is not, it will be seen, touched upon in the telegram of the Government of India : it may be assumed that a further communication will be received from them when their examination of the matter is complete. There remains the question of the draft convention for setting up a Riverain 'T'' rt* Commission in the Shatt-el-Arab. The telegrams received from Sir P. Cox on this subject, dated the 29th May and the 4th June, were enclosed in the letters of this Office, dated the 4th and 7th June respectively, and it was explained in the penulti mate paragraph of the former letter that the views of the Government of India would in due course be communicated. These views, it will be seen, are in general accord with those expressed by Sir P. Oox, but reason has been shown in the letter last referred to why for the present at any rate they are inadmissable, and the Marquess of Crewe has little to add to what he has said already upon this subject. As regards the policing of the river, I am to say that one of the objects of the proposed convention is to remove as far as possible all opportunity and excuse for intervention and obstruction on the part of the local authorities, who often are—or are conveniently represented to be—imperfectly controlled by the Central Government. From this point of view it is most desirable that the maintenance of order should be in the hands of such a semi-independent body as the commission, acting in direct subor dination to the Porte itself. In reply to the argument that, ' since the policing of the river must include the suppression of piracy,' those duties must continue in the hands of the local authorities. Lord Crewe is disposed to think that with the increasing development of commerce and navigation in the Shatt-el-Arab, the suppression of piracy will assume a subordinate aspect, and may safely be left to the commission ; but it might possibly be arranged that some police functions should be performed by the Sheikh of Mohammerah under the authority and supervision of the commission. As regards the approaches of the Shatt-el-Arab, it was thought preferable by the interdepartmental committee which drafted the convention that the limits of the commission's control should not be defined in the manner suggested by the Govern- C ment of India, and clause 17 of the final draft (which the Government of India do not seem to have had before them when they telegraphed) was thought to provide sufficient safeguard. But there are obvious advantages in defining once for all the limits of territorial waters if the Turkish Government can be brought to abandon the extravagant claims which they are understood to entertain. In this connection it is very desirable that it should be formally laid down that the channel over the whole of which the Turkish jurisdiction is now to be admitted should be the channel at low water—that is to say, that all land between high and low water marks on the Persian bank will belong to Persia. From this it will follow that islands connected with the Persian bank at low water will be Persian, and one of the difficulties foreseen by Sir P. Cox will thus be removed. This stipulation will perhaps [2511 f—1] 1 I)2 be more conveniently made in the negotiations regarding the frontier than in the convention setting up the Riverain Commission. If it is thought that the Turkish Government can effectively prevent the British representative from corresponding direct with his Government, it is desirable to secure this right for him in the convention. But as he will be a servant of the Porte it will presumably not be possible for him to speak in the name of the British Government. In paragraph 6 of my letter of the 4th instant it was suggested that the British member should be expressly empowered to represent the interests of Mohammerah when necessary. This is important also for the purpose of allotting the proceeds of the con solidated dues to be levied by the commission, since, as pointed out by Sir P. Cox in the telegram of the 4th April, the major part of the shipping affected will be that plying to the ports of Mohammerah and Abadan. But, incidentally, this raises the difficulty mentioned by Sir P. Cox in his telegram of the 6th May, of the constitutional position of the sheikh, and appears to necessitate, at some stage of the negotiations, a commu nication to the Persian Government. Sir E. Gery will, no doubt consider when and in what form this can best be made, but Lord Crewe would suggest that it is desirable that it should not be made until the negotiations with Turkey have reached a point at which no action or inaction on the part of Persia can disturb them, and that, in the first instance, the sheikh should be regarded as the party primarily concerned.

ACCORDING to a report just received from His Majesty's consul-general at Bagdad, the chief engineer of the Bagdad Railway intends to proceed shortly to Khanikin, accompanied by the Turkish head of the Customs, in order to select a site for the custom-house, transit warehouses, and railway station there. Mr. Lorimer understands that no details of survey have yet been made for the line to Khanikin, and no materials have yet reached Bagdad for this line ; but he gathers that the present intention is that it should run on the west side of the Diyala from Sadiya to the immediate neighbourhood of Khanikin, thus saving the construction of an extra bridge. Sir R. Crawford informs me that no report has yet been received here from the chief of the Bagdad Customs on the results of his journey to Khanikin. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.

With regard to participation, of course the German stipulation would have to be considered. I said that we were now drawing up our reply to the Turkish Government, and we hoped to send it to them early next week. I could not say how the question of participation might be arranged. We recognised that if we were to participate the question would have to be discussed with Germany, but acquiescence in the ending of the railway at Bussorah would be included in our reply to Turkey.

I AM directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th July, forwarding the draft of a memoranclu:n respecting negotiations now pending with the Turkish Government, which Sir E. Grey proposes to communicate to the Turkish Ambassador, and to return the draft herewith with certain amendments, indicated in red ink, # which they desire to suggest for Sir E. Grey's consideration. With regard to the several amendments, I am to point out that the words ' from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem ' have been deleted from (hi) of the third paragraph of the draft and from the heading to section (iii), since the effect of the proposal for the special treatment of British cotton manufactures, set out in the amended form of section (iii), will be to limit the rate of customs duty to something less than 15 per cent, in the case of an important item in the Turkish import trade. The addition of certain words at the end of the fifth paragraph of the draft has been suggested with a view to emphasising the close relation between the withdrawal of the British claim to participate in the railway between Bagdad and ''j y ^ Bussorah and the other proposals dealt with in the memorandum. / In view of the amended form of section (iii) now suggested, the words deleted from (a) of the sixth paragraph appear unnecessary. The Board think it advisable to indicate in [b] of the same paragraph the necessity of the British representatives upon the board of the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah being approved by His Majesty's Government, and they are also disposed to suggest that, should Sir E. Grey see no objection, this opportunity should be taken to direct {\ the attention of the Turkish Government to the desirability of British representation upon the board of the Bagdad Railway proper. Finally, section (iii) of the draft has been amended so as to indicate more precisely the attitude of His Majesty's Government towards the proposed increase of the Turkish customs tariff. I am at the same time to forward to you herewith the draft of a railway convention for submission, with Sir E. Grey's concurrence, to the Ottoman Government, and to state that the proposed schedule of cotton duties will be forwarded to you at the earliest possible date. I am. &amp;c. H. LLEWELLYN SMITH. Enclosure in No. 1. Draft of Memorandum to he coinmunlcated to Turkish Ambassador. J 1. HIS Majesty's Government have not failed to examine with much care and attention the important proposals which are embodied in the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last. 2. Throughout their deliberations, His Majesty's Government have been animated by the conviction that a complete agreement on outstanding questions is eminently to be desired in the larger interests of both countries. They are persuaded that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative * Printed in erased type and italics. [2546 «—7]2 and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty's Govern- ^ ment therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals and considerations :— 3. For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may be dealt with under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. . (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region ot the Persian Gulf. (iii.) An increase item ii eeat. te pe? in' the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. 4. The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse a region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total exports and imports is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty's Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner in which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah; they have recalled that no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Bussorah was British ; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Bailway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties. 5. The magnitude of Great Britain's manifold interests clearly renders it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section of the Bagdad Railway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty's Government find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circum stances His Majesty's Government, anxious to prove to the Ottoman Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive understanding without delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation in the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah, if a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the other 'points enumerated in this memorandum. 6. It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty's Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. His Majesty's Government consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the following conditions as essential to that end :— (a.) An arrangement, as set forth in the accompanying draft convention, for the Draft Con- exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey, as well as ae rnxkee- fAnn 011 2) tekiag^e*plai»e4 » a separate pape? as fc© tke ^©afeEaetrt ©f eesteia fei&amp;sfe imports. nnex (5.) The admission of two British representatives, approved by His Majesty's Government, to the board of whatever company may undertake the a4i&amp;i»ist¥atieH: construction or loorking of t^he railway from Bagdad to Bussorah. In addition, His r Majesty's Government considen it highly desirable in the interests of the smooth working of the arrangements that at least one British director, approved by them, should be admitted to the board of the Bagdad Railway Company. (c.) The terminus of the railway to be at Bussorah. (d.) No railway to be continued beyond Bussorah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior - - reement with His Majesty's Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. Dr^ft Con- ( e .) A convention to be signed, on the basis of the accompanying draft, for the (Annex 3 ) f ' u . ture conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. This convention must be read in conjunction L with a memorandum—which, as stated below, will shortly be communicated to the Porte—on the subject of the frontier of Mohammerah. (/.) An undertaking that permission should be given for three British steamers to te between Bagdad and Bussorah in addition to the number already allowed. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. 7. His Majesty's Government note with satisfaction .that the Turkish Government• • • • (\T renounce their claims to Bahrein on conditions which there should be no difficulty in V ^ accepting, but they have learnt with disappointment the attitude of the Imperial Ottoman Government in regard to El Katr and Koweit; nevertheless they do not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the important sacritice made by His Majesty's Government in the matter of British participation in the Bagdad Railway, ^ and that they will meet that sacrifice by a corresponding modification of the views set forth in the Turkish memorandum of the 15th April. 8. His Majesty's Government must in the first instance protest against the con tention that there is a misunderstanding with regard to the assurance given, and repeatedly given, to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, to the efiect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. 9. The original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office, and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy. 10. His Majesty's Government maintain that prior to Midhat Pashas expedition there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish jurisdiction or occupation, effective or ineffective. And while they are now prepared to recognise Annex 4. Turkish sovereignty between the southernmost limits of Koweit (as hereinafter defined) and Ojeir, they are unable to admit that any of the arguments adduced in the Turkish memorandum in any way invalidates the statement that south of Ojeir, in the district of El Katif, there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; and they are fully persuaded that El Katr has never been locally regarded as forming part of, or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire. For themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the Turkish assurances mentioned above, they have never so regarded it, and they have repeatedly informed the Sublime Porte accordingly. 11. His Majesty's Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula ot El Katr, including El Bidaa. They have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itself so recently as 1870, and they are bound-to continue that opposition. _ . . , 12. The Turkish memorandum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty s Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Koweit. His Majesty's Government are concerned to ensure the continuance of the local government of the Sheikh of Koweit, as defined in their memorandum of the 29th July, 1911, which incontestably forms part of the status quo. Further, His Majesty's Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit and indeed to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, Memo- to the withdrawal of the Turkish military post from Bubiyan, and to a recognition ^dum ^ of the limits of Koweit injaccordance with the indications contained in the accompanying ^ memorandum. . j , 13. His Majesty's Government regret that they would consider the introduction ot divided responsibility for maritime police measures altdgether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their pc'.icy in the Persian Gulf. This policy' consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the system in these circumstances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed His Majesty's Government would go further. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf; they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative ; and it was this attitude which led to the declaration made by the Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that ' His Majesty's Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to ^British interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal.' His Majesty's Government must therefore ask the Turkish Government to recognise in the Persian Gulf the right of Great Britain—(a.) To control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (b.) To police its waters; and (c.) To conduct all quarantine arrangemer fi na j p r0 posals for the acceptance of the Turkish Govern- 04 ment, His Majesty's Government are not seeking territorial aggrandisement, nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simply to secure the recognition and to ensure the continuance of an order ^ of things which, in fact, grew up under their auspices and before the appearance of iurkish authority in the Persian Gulf, and which has been proved by experience to favour the development,^- of trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which, but for long-sustained British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and. bloodshed. 16. They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government will not oppose the continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years, and they look^ forward confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the improved relations which cannot fail to ensue. 17. As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a question which has caused some concern to His Majesty's Government in recent months, that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah, ^ hen His Majesty s Government addressed their memorandum of July 1911 to the Ottoman Government that question had been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty's Government had no desire to raise it. Now however that it has been raised, by circumstances beyond their control, they feel that no settlement in the Persian Gulf could be complete which did not provide for this question, and they regard a satisfactory adjustment of Memo- it as an essential part of the present negotiations. They have the honour to randum submit a separate memorandum on the subject for the consideration of the Ottoman (A nnex o). , 7 Government. (hi.)

Sir, Board of Trade, July 8, 1912. I AM directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th July, forwarding the draft of a memorandum respecting negotiations now pending with the Turkish Government, which Sir E. Grey proposes to communicate to the Turkish Ambassador, and to return the draft herewith with certain amendments, indicated in red ink,* which they desire to suggest for Sir E. Grey's consideration. With regard to the several amendments, I am to point out that the words ' from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem' have been deleted from (iii) of the third paragraph of the draft and from the heading to section (iii), since the effect of the proposal for the special treatment of British cotton manufactures, set out in the amended form of section (iii), will be to limit the rate of customs duty to something less than Y*? tS' ^ P er ceil t- in the case of an important item in the Turkish import trade. ' The addition of certain words at the end of the fifth paragraph of the draft has been suggested with a view to emphasising the close relation between the withdrawal of the British claim to participate in the railway between Bagdad and Bussorah and the other proposals dealt with in the memorandum. In view of the amended form of section (iii) now suggested, the words deleted from (a) of the sixth paragraph appear unnecessary. The Board think it advisable to indicate in (h) of the same paragraph the necessity of the British representatives upon the board of the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah being approved by His Majesty's Government, and they are also disposed to suggest that, should Sir E. Grey see no objection, this opportunity should be taken to direct the attention of the Turkish Government to the desirability of British representation upon the board of the Bagdad Railway proper. Finally, section (iii) of the draft has been amended so as to indicate more precisely the attitude of His Majesty's Government towards the proposed increase of the Turkish customs tariff. I am at the same time to forward to you herewith the draft of a railway convention for submission, with Sir E. Grey's concurrence, to the Ottoman Government, and to state that the proposed schedule of cotton duties will be forwarded to you at the | ^ earliest possible date. I am. &amp;c. H. LLEWELLYN SMITH. Enclosure I in No. 1. Draft of Memorandum to be communicated to Turkish Ambassador. 1. HIS Majesty's Government have not failed to examine with much care and Detention the important proposals which are embodied in the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last. 2. Throughout their deliberations. His Majesty's Government have been animated by the conviction that a complete agreement on outstanding questions is 'eminently to be desired in the- larger interests of both countries. They are persuaded that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative * Printed in erased tvpe and italics. [2546 i—7] ' B2 and future efiects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty s Govern ment therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals and considerations :— 3. For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may be dealt with under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. _ ^ V (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (hi.) An increase fe pe? eetrt. a4 in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. 4. The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse a region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total exports and imports is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty's Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner in which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah; they have recalled that no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Bussorah was British; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Railway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties. 5. The magnitude of Great Britain's manifold interests clearly renders it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section of the Bagdad Railway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty's Government find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circum stances His Majesty's Government, anxious to prove to the Ottoman Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive understanding without delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation in the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah, if a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the other points enumerated in this memorandum. 6. It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty's Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. His Majesty's Government consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the following conditions as essential to that end:— {a.) An arrangement, as set forth in the accompanying draft convention, for the Draft Con- exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey, as weii a« (Jnnex 2). e.^pJaiae^ i» a sepafate pape^ as te the ^eatetefrt el emawi fei&amp;sfe impe-rts. (h.) The admission of two British representatives, approved by His Majesty s Government, to the board of whatever company may undertake the atkaifiistmiea construction or icorking of the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah. In addition, His Majesty*s Government consider it highly desirable in the interests of the smooth working of the arrangements that at least one British director, approved by them, should be admitted to the board of the Bagdad Bailway Company. (c.) The terminus of the railway to be at Bussorah. (d.) No railway to be continued beyond Bussorah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty's Governnient, and on conditions acceptable to them. Draft Con- (e.) A convention to be signed, on the basis of the accompanying draft for the 7CZ ^ fu ^ Te conservanc 7 of the Shatt-el-Arab. This convention must be read in conjunction v with a memorandum—which, as stated below, will shortly be communicated to the/ Porte—on the subject of the frontier of Mohammerah. . (/•) An undertaking that permission should be given for three British steamers to navigate between Bagdad and Bussorah in addition to the number already allowed. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. 7. His Majesty's Government note with satisfaction that the Turkish Governmentrenounce their claims to Bahrein on conditions which there should be no difficulty in accepting, but they have learnt with disappointment the attitude of the Imperial Ottoman Government in regard to El Katr and Koweit; nevertheless thej do not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the important sacrifice made by His Majesty's Government in the matter of British participation in the Bagdad Railway, and that they will meet that sacrifice by a corresponding modification of the views set fj^th in the Turkish memorandum of the 15th April. 8. His Majesty's Government must in the first instance protest against the con tention that there is a misunderstanding with regard to the assurance given, and repeatedly given, to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the, supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. 9. The original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office, and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy. 10. His Majesty's Government maintain that prior to Midhat Pasha's expedition there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish jurisdiction or occupation, effective or ineffective. And while they are now prepared to recognise Annex 4. Turkish sovereignty between the southernmost limits of Koweit (as hereinafter defined) and Ojeir, they are unable to admit that any of the arguments adduced in the Turkish memorandum in any way invalidates the statement that south of Ojeir, in the district of El Katif, there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; and they are fully persuaded that El Katr has never been locally regarded as forming part of. or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire. For themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the Turkish assurances mentioned above, they hava never so regarded it, and they have repeatedly informed the Sublime Porte accordingly. 11. His Majesty's Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula ot El Katr, including El Bidaa. They have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itself so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition. 12. The Turkish memorandum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty's Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Koweit. His Majesty's Government are concerned to ensure the continuance of the local government of the Sheikh of Koweit, as defined in their memorandum of the 29th July, 1911, which incontestably forms part of the status quo. Further, His Majesty's Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit and indeed to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, ^j- em0 to the withdrawal of the Turkish military post from Bubiyan, and to a recognition r an( i um of the limits of Koweit in accordance with the indications contained in the accompanying (Annex 4). memorandum. 13. His Majesty's Government regret that they would consider the introduction of divided responsibility for maritime police measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their policy in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the system in these circumstances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed His Majesty's Government would go further. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf; they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative ; and it was this attitude which led to the declaration made by the 'irquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that 'His Majesty's Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal.' His Majesty's Government must therefore ask the Turkish Government to recognise in the Persian Gulf the right of Great Britain—(a.) To control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (h.) To police its waters; and (c.) To conduct all quarantine arrangements. 15. In submitting these final proposals for the acceptance of the Turkish Govern- [2546 7j B 24 ment, His Majesty's Government are not seeking territorial aggrandisement, nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simply to secure the recognition and to ensure the continuance of an order^ of things which, in fact, grew up under their auspices and before the appearance of iurkish authority in the Persian Gulf, and which has been proved by experience to favour the developme-'-,, of trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which, but for long-sustained Bntisn intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and bloodshed. 16. They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government will not oppose the continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years, and they look forward confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the improved relations which cannot fail to ensue. 17. As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a question which has caused some concern to His Majesty's Government in recent months, that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah. When His Majesty's Government addressed their memorandum of July 1911 to the Ottoman Government f that question had been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty's Government had no desire to raise it. Now however that it has been raised, by circumstances beyond their control, they feel that no settlement in the Persian Gulf could be complete which did not provide for this question, and they regard a satisfactory adjustment of Mem0_ it as an essential part of the present negotiations. They have the honour to (Annex 5) submit a separate memorandum on the subject for the consideration of the Ottoman Government. (hi.)

Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Draft Articles for a Convention between the British and Ottoman Governments in respect of Railways in Asiatic Turkey. Article 1. NO discrimination of any kind shall be exercised on any portion of the railways connecting Bagdad with other places in Asiatic Turkey, or on any of the branches thereof, in respect of traffic passing over the said railways, whatever may be its origin or destination. The word ' traffic ' in this and the following articles shall apply to passengers and their luggage, goods, animals, and things conveyed on the railways, and carriages waggons, and other vehicles adapted for running on the railways. Article 2. Equal expedition shall in all cases be afforded on the said railways to consignments of traffic of the same description and quantity. Article 3. All reasonable facilities shall be provided by the said railways for the interchangeof traffic; and each railway shall afford all due and reasonable facilities and accommoda tion for exchanging, receiving, forwarding, and delivering such traffic without any unreasonable delay. Article 4. No special rates or facilities shall be accorded by any of the said railways in respect of any goods carried from or to any of the ports of Asiatic Turkey which shall not be accorded equally to all goods of a like character and carried in similar quantities on the same route, irrespective of the nationality or ownership of the vessels by which thev are conveyed, or to be conveyed, to or from such ports; and no special arrangement in respect of rates or facilities lor traffic shall be made by any of the said railways with any shipping undertaking trading to or from any port of Asiatic Turkey which shall not equally, and under like conditions, extend to all other shipping undertakings so trading. Article 5. Any complaints which may be brought to the notice of the Imperial Ottoman Oovernment by His Britannic Majesty's Government, in respect of the treatment of traffic of any kind under the provisions of the foregoing articles, shall immediately be .communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government to the railway administration or administrations concerned, and, unless settled to the satisfaction of the two Governments within three months, be forthwith referred to the International Court of Arbitration at The Hague, which, shall have power to determine the matter finally and to award damages. Any determination or award of the International Court of Arbitration shall be immediately enforced by the Imperial Ottoman Government, and any damages awarded shall be paid by the Imperial Ottoman Government to His Britannic Majesty's Oovernment to be dealt with at their discretion. Article 6. Any difference as to the interpretation or carrying out of this convention shall, unless settled to the satisfaction of the two Governments within three months, be referred for determination to the International Court of Arbitration at The Hague.[This Docmaeiit is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [j u l y 13.] r CONFIDENTIAL . Seoiion 1. [29769] No. 1. India Office to Foreign Office.—{Received July 13.) Sir- India Office, July 12, 1912. IN reply to your letter of the 6th instant on the subject of the Bagdad Railway negotiations, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a telegram from the Government of India regarding the 'cahier des charges' attached to the Bagdad Railway Convention. The Marquess of Crewe is advised that, inasmuch as it is no longer proposed by His Majesty's Government to participate in the Bagdad-Bussorah section, if con structed, it is not necessary to insist on the amendments suggested by the Government of India. While, therefore, he is inclined to agree with the Government of India that the amendments are desirable in themselves, he will not press them if Sir E. Grey prefers not to take them up at this late stage. I am to add that he concurs in the draft articles for a convention in respect of railways in Asiatic Turkey prepared by the Board of Trade. With reference to the draft annex on the subject of cotton goods, I am to call attention to paragraph 5 of my letter of the 8th instant, and to say that Lord Crewe regards the proposed addition with grave misgiving, not only as tending to overcharge negotiations which he understands Sir E. Grey to think sufficiently charged already, but also as likely to bring other Powers into the field with claims for tariff concessions in favour of their own special interests. In this way the scope of the negotiations may, he fears, be dangerously enlarged, with serious risks to the prospects of securing the objects for which alone they were initiated. While, therefore, he is unable to object to the inclusion of a proposal regarding cotton in the indeterminate form now suggested, he desires to state at once in unequivocal terms his view that it will be impossible to place it on the same level as the political conditions, or to sacrifice any of them to it. Those conditions have been advanced, and can, in his opinion, be fully justified on grounds of Imperial no less than of Indian interests. The broad answer to the criticism that the tangible commercial advantage secured is disproportionate to the cash price paid (so far as that criticism is well-founded) is to be found in the very considera tion which it is proposed to urge upon the Turkish Government, viz., that the agree ment ' to be justly appreciated should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general.' The general result of the agreement (above and beyond particular commercial advantages) will be the secure establishment in the Persian Gulf of the political position of Great Britain under the shadow of which alone British commerce can flourish; while the loss of that position cannot fail to react seriously upon the prestige and, pro tanto, the commercial interests of this country not only in those regions, but throughout the East.

GREENWAY, Managing Director. Enclosure in No. 1. Mr. Soane to Mr. Greenway. Dear Mr. Greenway, Bagdad, June 14, 1912. I THOUGHT it might interest you to hear the result of a confidential talk I have been enabled to have with his Excellency Meissner Pasha, director-in-chief of the Bagdad Railway. In return for certain information I was able to afford him regarding the country of Irak and prospects, he was good enough to tell me that as the main section of the line is being delayed, partly over some question concerning the kilometric guarantee and partly over that of the Bagdad-Bussorah section, lie was anxious to construct such branches as, not being included under the kilometric guarantee, are not liable to the \\ causes of delay suffered on the parts thereto subject. He looks first to the Khanikin line as being easy, offering a quick return, and one which will keep his highly paid staff employed in the interval. He informed me that the line would probably pass north of Bakuba, Shahraban, and Kizil Rubat, crossing the Diala river between the last place and Khanikin, and that if lie finally decides to go ahead he would not take more than eight months to get trains running, as the route is very simple. He will be visiting Khanikin with the chief of customs in a few days (to decide upon a site for the station and customs house) and asked me to meet him there, and also for permission to come to Chia Surkh. I gave him an invitation to do so, as there is nothing there with which he is not familiar, and he is a man whose great influence in the affairs of the Bagdad and Mosul vilayets renders his friendship very desirable. He knows very well that the oil found on the Turkish side (at Mandali, Gil, Khurmati, Dwazda Imam, and Kirkuk), quite apart from the fact that it is so impregnated with sulphur as to be refined only under great expense and difficulties, is not exploited, and has very little chance of being exploited for a long time to come. (All these places are far beyond the zone of 20 idiom, beside the line which they may exploit themselves.) In that case, if we have sufficient oil, we might be able to sell fuel oil to the Khanikin branch, the better prospect of such being afforded by the fact that Meissner Pasha, being notably engineer first and politician after, looks only to the satisfactory consummation of his technical aims, and utilises what suits him in its attainment, regardless of the questions of nationality, which present obstacles where other foreigners are concerned. The characteristic is witnessed by his attitude towards and assistance to another British concern here, solely because they can further the progress of his work. Yours sincerely, E. B. SOANE.

Delaunay presented himself at the Mmistry of Public Works in response to Javid Bey s invitation, he was informed conducted with great secrecy, but I believe that the foregoing represents the present state of affairs. I am told that o-fthe arguments used by M. Revoil in urging immediate signature was that he wished that M.

Aleppo, July B, 1912. i ilAv ji, the honour to submit the following short report on the progress made m the construction of the Bagdad Railway line in this district. The station at Aleppo is now nearing completion. Strong iron sleepers, imported from Germany, are being used throughout the permanent way. The rails have been laid from Aleppo to Muslemieh, the junction, and thence north-eastwards as far as the Sajur. A temporary wooden bridge is being built over the Sajur. Work has begun upon a temporary wooden bridge to span the Euphrates near Jerablus, which should be completed by the end of October next. Fears are expressed as to the stability of this temporary bridge in flood time. It is said that the line from the Sajur to the Euphrates will be finished by the end of September. I understand that the various pieces required to construct the Euphrates permanent steel bridge have not yet been purchased owing to the high prices now ruling in Germany. Difficulties are, moreover, foreseen as to the construction of an embankment near Jerablus village. The station at Muslemieh is nearly completed. The stations between there and Jerablus will be Akterin, Chorban Bey, Sajur, and Helman. From Muslemieh westwards the line has been laid up to some little way beyond Catma, a distance of over 40 kilom. in all. The expulsion of over 500 Italian engineeis and workmen seems to have seriously afiected the construction of the line. Some Greek engineers and mechanics were afterwards brought over to carry on the work, which has been rapidly pushed forward. Most of the manual labour, however, since the expulsion of the Italians, appears to have been performed by native gangs of labourers, and the rails in various places between Muslemieh and the Sajur have been unevenly laid, viz., one rail higher or lower than the other. This may prove a serious drawback to heavy trains travelling at any speed. I understand that no money has been paid for the expropriation of the lands in the Sajur-Jerablus region, saving, perhaps, certain of those which are actually under cultivation. Much dissatisfaction has been caused at Aleppo by the low prices paid by the company, backed bv the Government, for the expropriation of private property, and at Alexandretta it is said that much real injustice has been done to landowners in this way. The company began, and have carried on the work regardless, apparently, of expense, and huge sums have been expended in connection with the work. An enormous quantity of costly material has been imported, a large staff of highly paid German engineers, craftsmen, officials, and native clerks are employed, and the wages paid to the labourers on the line have been quite abnormal. The company, nevertheless, have acquired an unenviable reputation through all this district. Various contractors for the construction of sections of the line have abandoned their contracts with great pecuniary loss. A French contractor, who had invested his whole capital in the work, died recently at Aleppo, leaving a widow nearly penniless with a claim of over 2,000L against the company. Another French subject, an engineer, who threw up work in the Far East to obtain employment on the Bag.iad Railway, spent his entire capital [2546 y—2]2 of 1,000L in attempting to fulfil a contract with the company, but owing to a rise in labourers' wages, and to other causes he did not succeed, and is now prosecuting the company-in the Ottoman law court for the recovery of the 1,000L The company have hitherto refused to modify any contract entered into, whatever might be the circum stances tending to render its fulfilment difficult or impossible. Contractors have, on more than one occasion, tried to make their losses good by paying their native labourers less than the daily wage agreed upon, thus provoking tumult and outcry. Some time jp ago three Kurdish labourers were wounded at Aleppo by Circassiap guards in the company's employ, and two others were injured at Jerablus by guards in a scuffle arising from the Kurds attempting to mob the paymaster, who paid them less than their stipulated wage. The native workmen in the company's employ at Jerablus show themselves eager to find employment with the Englishmen now carrying on excavations on the Jerablus mound, who employ several hundred men, and are greatly respected by the natives for their fair dealing and tact. The Germans, unfortunately, have incurred the distrust and dislike of the natives, whom they treat with no very rigid justice and with scant consideration. Many of the Italian workmen and mechanics, on the eve of their departure from Aleppo, openly expressed their relief at being compelled to sever connection with the Bagdad Kailway Company. The inauguration of the construction of the port at Alexandretta took place on the 10th ultimo, the local authorities, civil and military, being present at the ceremony. I have, &amp;c. K A.

India Office, June 7, 1912. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum hy Sir A. Hirtzel respecting the Baghdad-Basrah Railway. 1. The mesent Position. —At the interdepartmental conference of the 30th March 1911 Sir E. Grey proposed that we should ask for a 50 per cent, participa tion and a memorandum for the Turkish Government was prepared on this basis. On the 7th April, 1911, the Board of Trade wrote that there were ' only two prac ticable policies ' : (1) ' To participate in the working of the southern section on termsof equality with Germany, but to the exclusion of all third parties as, regards control,' and (2) to refuse participation altogether. No further communications passed'between the departments on this subject, but on the 12th July, a draft memorandum to the Turkish Government was privately communicated to the India Office. This memorandum contained the proposal, which was actually made to the Turkish Ambassador on the 29th July, 1911, that Great Britain, Eussia, France, Germany, and Turkey should participate at the rate of 20 per cent, each, and that a convention ekonld be drawn up precluding differential rates on all the railwavs of Asia Minor. The Turkish Government replied on the 15th April, 1912, not expressly rejecting this proposal, but substituting 25 per cent, participation for Great Britain, France, Germany, and Turkey, to the exclusion of Kussia. But in the private discussions that 'preceded the dispatch of this reply, the Turkish representatives more than once stated in the strongest terms their objection, on political grounds, to the inclusion of Eussia, and said that if His Majesty's Gov ernment pressed it they would be obliged to insist on the admission of Switzerland. This His Majesty's Government would, of course, not be able to accept, for it would strengthen the Baghdad Railway Company's interest at our expense. Kussia, It will be borne in mind, has said that, while she only wants to help us, she wants to be admitted if France is admitted. The Turkish counter-proposal of the 15th April, 1912, is, therefore, not a mere modification of our own, but, in effect, a complete rejection of it. A new situation is thus created, and it is submitted that in the circumstances His Majesty's Government are bound to consider it on its merits, and that it is pos sible for us, without doing any violence to diplomatic conventions or giving any just cause of offence to Turkey, to treat our proposal of the 29th July, 1911, as completely out of court, and to substitute for it a better one, if such can be found. It mav be conceded that as we have actually proposed the admission of France and Russia, our position is no longer as strong as it was for proposing their omission. But here the Turks have fortunately helped us. For if Russia insists on participating in tjie event of French participation, while Turkey will admit France but not Russia, the result is a deadlock, of which the only solution is the omission of both. The following considerations are intended to show that the proposal of the 29th July, 1911, should not be pressed, and that the terms which Sir E. Grey origi nally wished to put forward are, as the Board of Trade held, the only ones on which we should now consent to participate.11. The Objections to the last Proposals made hy His Majesty's Government.— The view underlying those proposals is that, provided we can secure a conven tion absolutely precluding differential rates on the whole of the Baghdad Railway system, the degree of our participation in the Gulf section is immaterial, and that it is, in fact, worth our while to purchase the convention by abating our claims to participation. The objections are ;— {a) That no convention can absolutely preclude differentiation or the application of those advantages which protectionist countries accord their trade. This is in effect the Board of Trade view also. (6) That the Baghdad Railway Convention already does so, as far as any convention can. See Article 24 of the c ' Cahier des charges '' : ' Tousles tarifs, qu'ils soient generaux,speciaux, ouproportionnels ou differentiels, sont applicables a tous les voyageurs et expediteurs sans distinction.' This applies to the Baghdad-Khanikin branch (article 1 of the convention), and to the Alexandretta concession, which is given on the same terms as the convention of 1903, except where otherwise specified. (c) Differential rates are not the only risk involved in absence of effective control. The Baghdad Railway Committee, in its report of the 26th March, 1907, quoted Sir James Mackay's opinion that the company, if under ' 4 a management of which this country exercised no influ ence or control,' 4 ' would lose no time in establishirg a line of steamers from the terminus to Bombay, and in course of time they would virtually monopolise the entire trade between India and the Persian Gulf, because it would be impracticable for the British lines to compete against the ships supported by the railway company, which would give through bookings and through rates for passengers and cargo. ^ This danger would exist the moment that the Bagh dad Railway Company's interest preponderated over the British interest, i.e., the moment the latter was less than 50 per cent. Again, there is the risk (referred to in the same report) that the 4 f railway company will make it their business to cut the freights between Basrah and Baghdad, so as to be able to compete with the river- borne traffic, 5 ' that is to say, the Baghdad Railway Company, if pre ponderant on the Gulf section, will drive the steamers off the river, and then raise the rates on the railway. They will not, of course, be able to do so beyond the point at which it will pay to put the steamers back on the river. But in order that we may be ready to take advantage of that moment when it comes it will be necessary that the steamers shall be there, which probably means paying Messrs. Lynch or someone else a subsidy to keep them efficient, though idle—another charge on the revenue of the Gulf sectioil before it can pay a dividend. {d) The Gulf section being the shortest, necessarily determines the rates on the northern section to Baghdad. It is therefore our interest to have as free a hand as possible on that section. Therefore, a convention applicable to the whole Baghdad Railway system is a positive disadvantage to us. (e) It is our interest to have as free a hand as possible, because it is essential to prevent the Baghdad Railway Company's interest from getting the preponderance. This is not sufficiently secured by the 20 per cent, participation, since we cannot depend on the permanence in all circumstances of the entente, commercially and financially (French finance, for example, is notoriously beyond the control of its Gov ernment) ; while politically it may be a serious source of weakness elsewhere (as pointed out by the Viceroy in his telegram of the 29th May: see appendix) that we should have important commercial interests bound up with the permanence of the entente in Mesopo tamia. U(/) As a financial proposition, it is to be feared that 20 per cent, in an inter national railway 350 miles long, costing less than 3,000,000 I. to construct, will not be considered worth looking at. On the other hand, the facts that (1) the German company has first of all to be compensated ; (2) rolling stock has to be provided and ports to be built; (3) the expense of international management will be unneces sarily heavy ; (4) the railway will have no prospect of paying for many years (until, in fact, Mesopotamia is irrigated and developed) ; (5) in the meantime there will be no guarantee (for it may be taken as certain that the Government of India, at all events, will give no guarantee), will be further disastrous to its flotation. The British share will simply not be taken up, and where is the Russian share to come from, when the Russian Government cannot find money for its favoured project, the Trans-Persian Railway, and Russian unofficial finance is concentrated on that enterprise ? {g) If, therefore, participation on these terms is of no value as a financial proposition, and if we have not sufficient control to prevent the Bagh dad Railway interest from preponderating, there is no apparent com mercial advantage in participation over non-participation. (h) The Gulf section would be a most valuable political asset if it were all British. It would still be valuable if it were British controlled, but it loses in value by leaps and bounds as British participation dimi nishes, until a point is reached where prestige will suffer less and dig nity be better consulted if the country which owns 70 per cent, of the trade and 85 per cent, of the shipping stands aloof altogether, rather than participates on an equality with three other Powers who have practically no material stake in the country at all. {i) No attempt has been made to show how the joint arrangement is to work in practice, e.g., is the actual working agency to be international, and is it seriously thought that that would be workable ? Again, in order that the commercial interests of the line may be effectively safeguarded, it must be worked independently of, and to some extent in opposition to, the Baghdad Railway, but it is extremely doubtful whether any arrangement with this object would be found workable in practice. III. The view, therefore, supported is that of the Board of Trade in their letter of the 7th April, 1911, that the only alternatives are to participate on a 50 per cent, basis (to which it should be added that, in that case, the chairman must be British), or not to participate at all. {a) The view that British control on the Gulf section is useless without a convention to prevent differential rates on the rest of the system has already been dealt with. It has also been pointed out that by control ling the shortest section we should, in fact, control the rates over the German section. It may further be urged that the sole effect to the Baghdad Railway Company of imposing differential rates against British goods between Alexandretta and Baghdad would be to send British trade round to the Basrah-Baghdad line. With 50 percent., the casting vote on the board, and a free hand as regards rates, our position would, therefore, be impregnable. (h) What would it be if we did not participate at -all ? It must be premised that from the British and Indian point of view it is better that the railway should not be built. It must be remembered that there is no analogy between the position now and the position in 1903. Then we might have had substantial participation in the whole length of the railway, which would, besides have admitted us to the exploitation of a new country. Now we are offered 20 per cent, in a branch 350 miles long, which will admit other Powers on' equal terms with us to the exploitation of a country of whose 'trade we already have 70 per cent. Politically. —The construction of the railway means the military, and adminis trative consolidation of Turkey in Mesopotamia, with an increased tendency to seek 15A influence in the Persian Gulf, and to extend control in Arabia, and an increased pow er of offensive against British interests, including Kuwait and Mohammerah. It further means the firmer establishment of Grerman, French, and Russian interests, with a corresponding tendency to intervene, in a region where the outside interests have hitherto been preponderatingly British, (It is not, of course, suggested that we can, or ought to try to, keep everyone else out; but to invite them in, and on such terms, is quite another matter.) Commercially. —Our interests are twofold. There is the existing trade with Western Persia via Baghdad and Khanikin, and the trade which is expected to grow up when Mesopotamia is irrigated and developed. The Persian trade is worth about 2,000,000/. It is difficult to forecast its future, but if the Trans-Persian Railway is built, and Mohammerah connected with it and with Burujird, the Persian trade will presumably desert Baghdad altogether. If Persian railways remain in abey ance, it is not clear that we shall be worse of! than we are at present, so long as the river between Baghdad and the Gulf is cypen, and Article 24 of the 'Cahier des charges'* operates to prevent differential rates on the Baghdad Railway. Again, the future local trade of Mesopotamia, being mainly in agricultural products, will probably in any case flow westwards to Alexandretta. This view seems to be borne out by the latest figures available for the trade of Baghdad, 1910, which areas follows:— I mports to B aghdad. From— £ United Kingdom.. ., .. .. .. .. 1,317,762 France .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 203,284 Austria-Htingary ». ,. .. .. .. 180,011 Belgium .. ,. .. .. 211,835 Germany .. .. ,. .. .. 53,705 United States of Arr .erics, .. ,. ... .. .. 806 India, China, and Japan .. .. .. .. .. 664,147 E xports prom B aghdad. To- United Kingdom.. France .. Austria-Hungary .. .» .. * Belgium .. .. _ Germany United States of America .. India, China, and Japan The Bulk of the British and Indian imports seems to be in cotton goods* twist, and woollens, and that of the exports carpets, wool, opium, and hides. It is, however, possible that cotton will be grown and pressed in Mesopotamia, and will find its way into eastern markets, and the mineral resources of the country (especially oil) may also add to the trade eastwards. But, speaking generally, it does not seem certain that the volume of trade resulting from the development of Mesopotamia will necessitate the construction of the Gulf section if India is not to lose its share, and it is probable that India will retain her share whether it is built or not. But, of course, it is not possible to assume that the railway will never be built. From the difficulty which it is understood that the Germans have had in disposing of the bonds of the other sections^f the Baghdad Railway, and from their willingness to part with their rights in the Gulf section, it may, indeed be inferred that they will be in no hurry to undertake the latter, while the Turks themselves have neither the money nor the means of obtaining it. The construction will therefore be post poned, but—as the line is of military and political importance to Turkey—it will eventually be built. In the interval much may have happened in Mesopotamia, as the Viceroy has reminded us, and it is not easy to foresee the conditions that will 16 132,131 14,591 3,077 30,441 155,049 87 CS03FD17 then exist. But supposing that the railway is worked on commercial lines, and that the clanse precluding difEerential tarifis is still operative, it does not appear from the point of view of our trade, that the fact of our having no share in it will be a disadvantage. Bnt, of course, it may not be run on commercial hues Pro tected by their kilometric guarantees the Germans may prefer to let itrus^-t would always be available for Turkish military purposes- and attract all the traffic to the northern section. In that case, too, it does not appear that, tU river were heft free, we should be any worse off commercially than if the line d d not exist at all. Politically, no doubt, we should be because the Turkish consoli dation would be effected, and if the railway were built under German auspices, German influence would be brought very near to the Gulf. But provided that we can ensure that the line will not be carried beyond Basrah, or if so, only on terms aareeable to Great Britain, and provided that we have in the meantime consoli dated our own position in the Gulf, that risk might fairly be taken. The one serious drawback would be that referred to under head (c) on page li the danger of the extinction of the British carrying trade between India and Baghdad Although this disadvantage might to some extent be compensated by the advantages that might accrue to other branches of trade, it is a very real one and would have to be faced. (It could only be met, apparently, by a correspond- ing interworking between steam-ships and railway companies on the Indian side— a matter which would obviously require very careful consideration.) Moreover, as has already been pointed out, it is equally attendant upon any arrangement which does not secure to this country effective control of the Gulf section. IV The Importance of the tfwer.—The necessity of keeping the river open has been emphasised throughout these remarks. By that is meant not only ensuring that it is kept properly dredged and navigable, and that no prohibitive dues are placed upon shipping (both of which will be secured, as far as the Shatt-el-Arab is concerned, by the separate convention setting up a Kiverain Commission), but also by maintaining the right of navigation as far as Baghdad. This is equally necessary, for the reasons already given, whether we renounce the railway alto gether or participate in it on terms short of effective control. It is therefore essential that the questions should at once be closely examined with a view to ascertaining exactly what rights of navigation British shipping possesses on the Tigris and Euphrates, and what steps should be taken to put them on a secure basis. V. Conclusions.—W&amp;z conclusions seem to be — (1) that, if the river is open, it is better for us that the railway should never be built; (2) that it is therefore not our interest to facilitate it except on terms which will make it commercially and politically advantageous to our selves ; (3) that the only terms on which it will be thus advantageous are that we secure effective control, i.e., 50 per cent, participation, the cast ing vote on the board of management, and a free hand as regards rates ; (4) that failing that, we should stand out altogether and concentrate on getting what we want in the Gulf, and especially the joint control with Turkey of the Shatt-el-Arab and the right of navigation to Baghdad, which are really the key to the situation. Mr. Brereton (Government director of Indian railway companies) has read and entirely concurs in these remarks so far as they touch on the commercial aspects of the scheme. VI. The 'practicability of obtaining 50 per cent. —At the interdepartmental conference of the 30th March, Sir E. Grey had apparently no doubt of this, and he at once proceeded to prepare the ground with France and Russia. France —Sir E. Grey to Sir F. Bertie, No. 123 of the 6th April, 1911.—M. Cam- had told Count Benckendorff that the question as to whether France c18 should participate in the Baghdad-Gulf section was one which concerned us alone. She would participate if we wished her to do so, but she did not regard it as her affair.' Russia. —Sir E. Grey to Sir G. Buchanan, No. 105, of the 10th April 1911.— Count BenckendorfE said that ' the Russian desire was to help us, and therefore their proposal \i.e., to participate ] would not hold if the question was one between us and Germany alone. He thought, however, that if it was ulti mately decided to have French co-operation, Russia should come in too.'' The India Office has no later information than this. Germany. —The India Office has not heard of any overtures to Germany on the subject. We know only that in 1909 M. Gwinner informed Sir E. Cassel that the Germans had no objection to Great Britain obtaining more than 50 per cent., and that it was from Hussein Hilmi that the opposition then came. Further, in 1911, Sir G. Lowther wrote (No. 183 of the 22nd March):—=• ' Prominent Germans here have recently been hinting that the Turks will have to accept any arrange ment come to between Berlin and London and that we perhaps could secure a more satisfactory arrangement by unofficial pourparlers with Germany.' He understood that the German Ambassador (Baron Marschall), who was just going to Berlin, would speak in this sense. To these facts, which are all that are available, must be added the considera tion already mentioned, that it is in Germany's interest that the Gulf section should be built, and she is therefore not likely to place unnecessary difficulties in the way of anyone who will find the money. It is, indeed, probable that she will ask a quid 'pro quo. Whether her demand will be excessive cannot be known until it is made. But it will doubtless be a matter for bargaining, and in any case it is a question whether it is not better to pay Germany for something that is worth having than Turkey for something that is not. | i Turkey.. —The Turkish attitude may possibly be hostile. For positive in formation we have only M. Gwinner's statement, quoted above. But it is known that Turkey is very suspicious of British designs in Mesopotamia, and she will doubtless prefer an international control because of the scope which it affords for the time-honoured policy of playing off the various Powers against one another. On the other, hand (1) it is strongly to her interest that the line should be built; (2) Sir G. Lowther, in his despatch No. 328 of the 12th May, 1911, has given reasons why she need not herself claim a large share; (3) she will not necessarily be worse off if we obtain 50 per cent., than under her own proposal. She is content now , to ask for 25 per cent., arid our proposal will leave her to divide 50 per cent, with Germany on the best terms she can get. Nevertheless, let it be assumed that she will object. The considerations ad vanced above are intended to show that no harm will result if, as a consequence, the Baghdad-Basrah Railway question is withdrawn from the present negotiations. It is submitted that His Majesty's Government would have a very good case for withdrawing it. Their own attempts to find a solution will three times have failed, and it is not reasonable to expect them to go on making overtures to Turkey in definitely. The Turkish representatives, at the private conferences which preced ed the official reply, made a great point of the fact that it was to oblige Great Britain that Turkey had induced the Germans to renounce their rights. It will now be for His Majesty's Government, while expressing thanks for this sign of good will, to regret that they do not see their way to accept the concession on the terms on which it is offered. We should say that we have shown our own good-will by making three attempts to meet the Turkish wishes ; we will give a still further proof of it now by withdrawing all objections to the construction of the railway as far as Basrah, by anyone to whom they choose to entrust it, on the s ole condi tion that they conclude with us a thoroughly satisfactory settlement on the Shatt- el-Arab and in the Gulf (including Mohammerah), in return for which we will J further give them the increase of customs duties. It is submitted that we may then fairly expect a full satisfaction of the demands made in the memoran dum of the 29th July, 1911, without the necessity of contemplating any further concessions.But it is at least open to argument that the Turks will not carry their objection to the 50 per cent, arrangement to the point of letting the negotiations break down :— (1) As has been urged above, it is important to them that the railway should be made; (2) They know that, whatever may be the value to us of Turkish friendship, the value to themselves of our friendship is much greater, and, if brought gently but firmly up to the point, it is likely that they will think twice before sacrificing it. VII. The Procedure to he adopted now. —If the above views, which are only a development of those expressed in India Office letters of the 3rd and the 29th March, 1911, are accepted, the doubt arises whether it is worth while to press for the 50 per cent, at all; whether it is not better to abandon the railway altogether and devote ourselves entirely to the river and the Gulf on the lines suggested above. But if it be decided that an attempt should be made to secure 50 per cent., the next question is how. This is really a question for the Foreign Office. The India Office have suggested that we should go direct to the German Government, and the Board of Trade, in their letter of the 7th April 1911, recommended that a confiden tial conference should be held with the authorities of the Baghdad Railway as a preliminary to further negotiations with Turkey. If it is held to be impossible to go to Germany independently of Turkey, the only course is apparently to inform the Turks that their own proposals being quite inacceptable, we find ourselves unable to negotiate on the basis of the German declaration of the 7th March 1911, but that if they choose to approach Germany with a view to modifying this, declaration so as to give us 50 per cent., and the cast ing vote, we will use our good offices with Germany and be willing to discuss with her the terms of a settlement on those lines, on the understanding that Turkey concludes an entirely satisfactory arrangement with us in the river and Gulf. VIII. The Alternative. —It is necessary to consider the possibility that if we take either of the lines suggested, the Turks will break off the negotiations alto gether, as regards both the railway and the Gulf. It is not thought likely, for the reasons, suggested under head VI, that this will happen, though they may hint at it by way of bluff. But if they did, it would seem that we should be morally in a very strong position if we could come before the public and say : ' We have made every effort to meet the Turks over the question of this railway, but without suc cess. But we do not wish to block it if we can get a settlement of vexatious ques tions in the Gulf. We have accordingly offered them a free hand for the railway as far as Basrah (beyond which, if it is ever made, it will never pay) and the increas ed customs duties in return for a recognition de jure of the position in the Gulf, which we have held de facto for a century, and they have refused..' Our policy would then be the maintenance, by force if necessary, of that posi tion. We should have to reckon with Turkish hostility both to ourselves and to the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah. The kind of measures which we should take are indicated in the Government of India's letter No. 24 of the 15th Feb ruary, 1912*, and, if driven to it, we should declare a protectorate over Kuwait. The strength or weakness of our position would then depend largely on the state of our relations with Germany. But it would seem that Germany would have no ground for taking exception to our action if we could tell her that we had been (and still were) anxious to make an arrangement with her, but had found the Turks so irreconcilable that they would not even accept the free hand for the railway which we had offered them. This contingency is mentioned merely for the sake of completeness. It is almost incredible that it should occur at a time when more than for many years past Turkish interests calmour for the good-will of Great Britain. Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade has read and agrees with all the above remarks.

[Foreign Office despatch No. 226 of the 28th May, 1912, transmitting letter from the Board of Trade of the 24th May, 1912.' F rom enquiries made at the customs, it would appear that, beyond an ex change of views between the department and M. Hugenin, the director-general of the Anatolian and Baghdad Railways, no attempt has yet been made to enter into serious negotiations relative to the construction of the new customs premises and warehouses at Baghdad. The railway company have arranged to prepare plans of the proposed buildings, and, until these have been submitted to and examined by the administration, no further steps are likely to be taken for the present. It is not possible, therefore, at the present moment, to define the basis on which .negotiatians will take place ; I understand, however, that the customs are disposed to agree to hand over all the warehousing of goods—goods for local consumption as well as those in transit—to the railway company, in accordance with the stipula tions of articles 23 and 24 of the Baghdad Railway Convention of the 5th March, 1903, but on the condition— 1. That goods intended for Baghdad are transported across the river to the town side by the railway company free of charge. 2. That goods shall enjoy free warehousing for the first eight days after landing and storing. 3. That storage dues shall only be levied after that period. 4. That the ' ardieh, ' or progressive warehousing charge levied in customs depots, shall be abolished as far as Baghdad is concerned.The railway company apparently claim their right, under article 24 of the convention, to erect and maintain bonded warehouses on any section of the rail way ; the question seems to be a debatable one, and turns on the interpretation of the Turkish text of the article. This matter will be gone into, as well as the ques tion of the building of the new customs offices, the expense of which will presum ably be borne by the administration.

Telegram (P.) No. 843, dated the 16th August 1912. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The India Office, London. My telegram 779 of 1st August and letter 1727 which will reach London 24th. This latter and also report now received from Political Agent, Kuwait, which will reach London 8th September, were written before receipt of copy of memo randum transmitted by His Majesty's Government to Turkish Ambassador on July 18th. The boundary that Shakespear would have advocated as the result of his past enquiries and as representing the claims of the Shaikh, would have been as follows:— Starting from junction of Khor Sabiya and Khor Zobair boundary would pass along waterway of latter so as to include Soof Island opposite Umra Kasr in latter Khor. The line would then pass north of Umm Kasr wells and north of Safwan wells and Jabal Sanam to the Ratk ridge ; thence south-west along the Batin as far as and including Hafar wells. From Hafar it turns south-east towards Safah and includes the wells ; passing thence south-south-east, for about 25 miles, it includes A1 Gara'a wells ; and from thence proceeds due east passing south of Wabrah and Anta's wells and so on until it cuts coast at southern shore of Mussalamiyah Bay which with its islands is claimed by Shaikh. As regards Umm Kasr, Safwan and Mussalamiyah, Shakepear remarks that whereas Shaikh has always specifically claimed these points when mention of them has arisen, we have never informed him that we questioned his claims and he will consequently be greately disappointed when he learns that they have been arbitrarily excluded from his territory, Cj3asis of boundary arrived at by Shakespear is the actual control of wells by J tribesmen owning allegiance to Shaikh Mubarakh and this of course is the main test of territorial possession in desert countries inhabited by nomads; document-l ary evidence in such cases is never procurable. Following evidence or considerations are advanced in support of particular points. As regards Umm Kasr, until present occupation of Turks, wells were habi tually frequented by Kuwait Arabs and all disputes arising there were referred toKuwait and not to Zobair, although former is three times as distant. Same remarks apply to Safwan. The line connecting Safwan with Ratk marks the northern boundary of the grazing grounds used by Kuwait Arabs. Batin is universally recognised as dividing line between adherents of Shaikh Mubarakh and those of Ibn Rashid. If latter's tribesmen cross it they are regard ed as raiders. As regards Hafar and its position in regard to Ibn Rashid—see paragraph 6 of my letter 1727 abovementioned. The wells of As Safah and A1 Gara a occupy similar position vis d vis Bin-Saud. Wabrah wells are within the recognised sphere of the Umtair tribe who have always been subordinate to Shaikh Mubarak^ Properly speaking their sphere also includes the Summan district to the southward. As regards Anta'a, see Residency telegram 437, dated 6th June 1908, to India and enclosure to letter i3 14 of 8th June 1908. The line Hafar, Safah, A1 Gara'a, Wabrah and Anta'a forms the limit within which the Shaikh is responsible for safety of caravans. As regards Mussalamiyah. The bay is the headquarters and main pro visioning base of the Kuwait pearling fleet. Any disputes arising there are referred to Kuwait and the locality is not used by other pearling boats. The islets of Qaru, Umm al Maradim and Kubar are all uninhabited and waterless but are frequented by Kuwait boats for purposes of catching fish and turtle and gathering fuel, and are generally recognised as appertaining to Kuwait. Failakah is inhabited and governed by Shaikh Mubarak^'s brother. Shaikh leaves ' zikat' or ti)bes on the following tribes roaming over tract in question, vis :— Awazim, Umtair, Ajman and Bani Khalid with the exception of a few unim portant and distant sections. Telegram (P.) No. 44, dated the i6thi August 1912. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The India Office, London, Please refer to my telegram No. 843 and insert the following as conclud ing paragraph:— Begins : The above evidence holds equally good, so far as it applies, to the line adopted by His Majesty's Government. Both the pine advocated in my letter No. 1727, dated 4th August, to the Government of India, and that now proposed by the Political Agent at Kuwait, comprise an area smaller than that enclosed by the line adopted by His Majesty's Government. For this reason it is hoped that it may perpaps still prove practicable to substitute, in the interests of the Shaikh, during the course of negotiation, .the southern boundary advo cated by Captain Shakespear, or, failing that, the line advocated by me in my above letter. Ends, No. C. 62, dated Kuwait, the 12th August 1912. From— C aptain W. H. I. S hakespear, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. In reply to your letter No. 1642, dated the 31st July 1912,1 have the honour to submit herewith in the form of a note, a report upon the boundaries of the Kuwait principality, with such evidence as is available, and which I have been able to criticize from personal observation. It must be remembered, however, that regarding jurisdiction over wild nomad tribes documentary evidence does not exist.3 2. I would at once observe that having been over most of the ground myself, having questioned Bedouin and other Arabs of almost every tribe, which wanders within 300 to 400 miles of Kuwait, it is not possible for me to agree with Mr. Lorimer in the limits he lays down in Volume II of his Gazetteer, In the attached Note 1 have tried to give, wherever possible, evidence recorded in our own papers and reports or gleaned first-hand from Arabs other than Shaikh MubarakJf; Mr. Lorimer's information, on the other hand, was derived almost exclusively from the Shaikh himself, at a time when our knowledge of the hinterland was far inferior to that available now, 3. It will be noticed that in the attached Note I have not mentioned Jabal Manifah nor Nairiyah Hill—the reason for the omission being that the line I indicate includes both these points as well within the Shaikh's territory With regard to the Summan—this tract by common consent among the Bedoum is regarded as within the •'dira ' (or district) of the Umtair tribe and so should come within Mubarakh's territory, that tribe being subordinate to him. My suggested boundary line, however passes along its northern limits. My reason for so placing the line is that the really important points are the wells, and none exist in the Summan tract; a tribe occupying Anta'a, Wabrah, Al Haba and A1 Gara'a wells is practically unassailable from the south except during the spring and after rain, when pools may be found. 4. The line indicated in my note is as definite and definable as any which one can expect to find in a desert, but it must be borne in mind that where wells are mentioned, those wells are included as mthin the line, for ownership of the wells is the paramount consideration. It is for this reason that Mr. Lorimer's supposition {vide Gazetteer, Volume II, page 1060)—a 'line running...so as to pass immediately south of Umm Kasr and Safwan to Jabal Sanam ... is untenable ; such a line throws these wells outside Kuwait territory and conse quently has the effect of virtually placing the boundary at the next nearest water, which is as far south as Jahra. 5. From the precis attached to your letter under reply it would appear that the Government of India and His Majesty's Government have arrived at certain conclusions with regard to the Turkish posts on the Kuwait boundaries. _ Nothing in my office archives shows that any final conclusion has been reached with regard to any particular point, and I mention this fact for I am convinced that nothing has ever been communicated to the Shaikh to lead him to suppose that we regard any of his claims as doubtful or that we contemplated acquiescing in any way in the continuance of any one of the Turkish posts. The news will therefore come to him as a considerable surprise and I venture to invite serious consideration to the probable effect on the Shaikh s mind of discovering for the first time that we are prepared to condone in the smallest degree Turkish aggressions on his borders. The result, in my opinion, would be most deleterious to the particularly cordial relations which now subsist between the Shaikh and overselves and perhaps lead to an infinity of petty trouble in the future. I would venture to recall the fact that for an oriental chief Mubarakh has been exceptionlly straightforward in his dealings with us and that the risk of estranging him does not appear to be warranted unless we have some very substantial quid pro quo to offer him, which is at present beyond my ken. In his reliance upon the British Government he has repeatedly rejected the most seductive of Turkish overtures and we are now in the position, it seems, of discussing his boundaries, his power, his position with the Turkish Government without giving him, one of the parties most concerned, much voice in the matter or indeed information as to the course of the discussion. 6. It is for this reason that I have submitted a somewhat exhaustive note from such records as were accessible to me and venture to urge with all defer ence that in the main the Shaikh's statement of the position is far more worthy of credence than that asserted by the Turkish Government. Since the above was drafted I have been able to obtain the state ments of some Safwan cultivators, which I attach as speaking for themselves.Note on the Boundaries of the Kuwait Principality. % In surveying the disputed boundaries of the Kuwait shaikhdom it will be convenient to commence from a definite point, proceed by west and south to east and return northwards to the first point, thus completing the circumscribing line. For starting point we will take Umm Kasr as being the most definite point and one on which some reliable evidence is available. Umm Kasr lies near the head of the Khor Zobair {vide Lorimer's Gazetteer, Volume II, page 1503). The earliest reference to the place is to be found in Colonel Lewis Pelley's report of his journey to Riadh (Bushire Residency letter No. 57, dated the 15th May 1866), where in paragraph 18 he records that ' Originally the Shaikhs of Kuwait occupied a fort called Mongassar on the Zobair creek a little to the northward ' I may note here that I have at various times and from at least a dozen of the Kuwait greybeards personally verified this statement to be an accepted fact. The place only came into prominence in the early part of 1902 owing to the arbitrary location by the Turkish Government of a detachment in the mud-walled enclosure called the Fort: this act seems to have been retaliatory to the British support accorded to Mubarakh a few months before. On the 15th February 1902 the spot was visited by H. M. S. 'Sphinx', shortly after the arrival of the Turkish detachment, and it will be seen from Commander Kemp's report dated the 20th February 1902, to the Senior Naval Officer, that at that time the place was certainly regarded as within Kuwait terri tory, and it was only the presence of the British Naval Officer and his personal intervention which prevented an attack by Kuwait Arabs on the Turkish post. Since that date the post has been maintained but with diminished numbers (the present figure being 8 or 10 men). Though Mr. Consul Wratislaw in 1902 considered the Kuwait Shaikh's claims to Umm Kasr 'very shadowy ', it is not apparent that he relied upon any stronger evidence that the actual existence at the time of a Turkish post and upon the fact that the Shaikh of Kuwait made np immediate effort to eject the soldiers. Mr. Wratislaw, however, also comments that 'the Turks seem to have little claim beyond that of actual occupation '— an occupation which we know to have been initiated only a few months earlier. The probable and natural explanation (and the one always given by the Shaikh himself) for his supine attitude in this matter, is that his valuable date-gardens on the Shatt-al-Arab were hostages to fortune and he was not prepared to risk reprisals on his main source of income in order to uphold his title to a barren and comparatively worthless spot. Had the Shaikh not been influenced by a fear that any direct action against the post might deprive him of British sympathy, he would and certainly could have wiped out every Turkish post in his borders with the greatest of ease at any time within the last ten years. The next recorded opinion I find as to the ownership of Umm Kasr is in my predecessor's letter No. 136, dated .the 4th January 1905, written after a tour past the Fort with Mr. Lorimer's Gazetteer party, and in this he includes Umm Kasr within the Shaikh's domain. The Shaikh's own view of his claim is given sufficiently fully in my letter No. G.-53, dated the 3rd July 1912, and expresses what he has always maintained verbally; in this connection a reference to Bushire Residency letter No. T-10, dated the 11th June 1905, is also invited. My own opinion formed on numerous independent enquiries during the last three years from many different persons. Bedouins and others, certainly supports the Shaikh's claim. There is no question of his reviving a claim to the Fort; the Shaikh's objection is to the existence of a Turkish post, for the continued presence of foreign soldiers at a group of desert wells naturally connotes the jurisdiction of their Government over them. In point of fact, I believe, the present fort was built by the Turkish troops when the original mud-walled enclosure crumbled away. The strongest evidence in the Shaikh's favour lies in the following facts {a) That until the occupation of the posts at Umm Kasr and Safwan, it occurred to no one that Turkish jurisdiction went so far. {h) That to the present day disputes between the Bedouin at these wells are referred to Kuwait as a matter of course.(t) That persons looted by Arabs at these wells always resort to Kuwait for redress. (i) All Arabs using these wells consider the Shaikh of Kuwait as the responsible ruler of the immediately surrounding tract. When the relatively short distances of these wells from Zobair and Basra is compared with those from Kuwait, it will be conceded, I think, that without some very good ground or reason resort would not be had to the Kuwait Shaikh for redress. In the face of long existing traditions and facts of the above descrip tion, which moreover are supported by the reports of our own officials since 1866, it appears impossible to me to ignore the justice of the Shaikh's claim and he will certainly be bitterly disappointed if his plaint is dismissed as not proved on the objection that a Turkish post has existed (and that on sufferance) at the spot for the past ten years. Safisoan. —The above remarks apply with almost equal force to the case of Safwan, but here, though the name does not appear so frequently in our own officials ' reports, we have some cultivation and it may be possible to produce the evidence of the actual cultivators. Mr. Lorimer (Gazetteer Volume II, page 1642) appears to take for granted that the village and cultivation have always been within Turkish boundaries, a view which I have not found to be shared by either desert or town Arabs. I was in the vicinity in March 1910 and again in January 1911, when I passed the wells. Cultivation appeared to have ceased and I am told by the Shaikh that this has come about through the exactions and oppression of the soldiers quartered in the Turkish fort. The Shaikh agreed readily to send to me for cross-examination any of the original cultivators if they should happen to be in Kuwait and I hope to be able to forward their depositions later. Most of the cultivators used (to go?) to Nejada, who had been settled at Safwan from many years before As in the case of Umm Kasr his jurisdiction over the wells is rendered void before the world by the presence of the Turkish detachment, and it is to this presence, continued for ten years, that the Shaikh takes objection. Jahal Sanam lies a little to the south and west from Safwan {vide Lori- mer's Gazetteer, Volume II, page 1642) and is claimed by the Shaikh as within his northern boundary, running on westwards to the Ar-Ratk ridge where the latter impinges on the northern end of the Batin depression- The line from Umm Kasr to the Batin as described above is a natural one favoured by the terrain ; wells on or near a boundary are always apples of discord with Arab tribes, for whilst used freely by two contiguous tribes when at peace they would certainly be claimed by both if any question of ownership arose, and the very fact of such contention will often establish where a particular tribe s boundary may be said actually to lie. In the present case the Dhafir and Munta- fick tribes both occasionally claim Safwan wells and describe them as their south ern boundary conterminous with Mubarak's. Bat as it is the As-Subah writ which runs in their immediate vicinity, the balance of evidence favours-their in clusion within Mubarakh's territory. Al Batin is a very plainly marked natural feature running north-east and south-west from the As-Ratk ridge to Al Hafar {vide Lorimer's Gazetteer, Volume II, page 281) and has always been pointed out to my predecessor and myself as the As-Subah boundary. It is habitually used for grazing by the camels of Kuwait merchants during the spring and at other times, and depreda tions committed therein and eastwards always become Mubarakh's concern in obtaining redress or allocating punishment; west of the Batin is regarded as Shammar and Dhafir territorry. One of the main caravan routes into the interior from Kuwait strikes into the Batin at Rigai wells and the road thence lies in the bottom of the depression. Al Hafnr.~~hs far as these wells caravans from the east and north are always considered to be under the Kuwait Shaikh s protection. As a further instance of evidence of the kind mentioned above, it is interesting to note that when Mubarakh is on good terms with the Shammar tribe this tribe uses the Hafarwells in the summer, and if asked as to their boundaries I have no doubt would claim them for Bin Rashid : previous to 1897 when Mahomed-bin Rashid s power was paramount such claim would have been correct but since that power waned the wells have been recognised as marking the western point of Kuwait jurisdic tion. As-Safah. —Leaving Al Hafar by the Falaij Janubiah in a south-easterly direction the Kuwait boundary would follow a track to the As-Safah wells, where another of the main caravan routes from Kuwait comes in, and up to this point again caravans using that route consider themselves under Kuwait protection. In a former report (my letter No. »33, dat^d the 23rd March 119.0) Ides^ cribed the southern boundry as being a line joining As-Safah with Anta a village. At a later date (March 191 1) I was able to traverse the country east and south of As-Safah and found that this boundary, as claimed by the Shaikh, might be more accurately described as running from As-Safah, for some 25 miles S. S. E. to Al Gara'a wells and thence due east to VVabrah wells and thence east by south to Anta'a. This line passes across the heads of the numerous valleys running north and south through the Sam man tract and is a more or less natural line. Al Starting from As-Safah in a south-south-east direction the Al Gara'a wells will be reached after some 25 miles and lie on an alternative route from Kuwait for the interior. Leaving Al Gara's and heading almost due east the boundary would follow a fairly nutural line across the head of the Summan valleys to Wabrah wells. A reference is invited to Lorimer's Gazetteer, Vol. 11, page 1919 in this connection. An alternative line which I am inclined to regard as more correct since it accords better with the He of ground is from As-Safah wells south-east by east direct to Wabrah wells and thence to Anta'a. Anta'a village. —From Wabrah travelling east by south would take the boundary line through some rough country still on the north side and edge of the Summan tract to Anta'a village. This village looks to Kuwait for its employment and the imported necessaries of life, the people regard themselves as Kuwait subjects and their Shaikhs frequently visit Kuwait to pay their respects to Shaikh Mubarakh, on whom their authority and position depend in considerable measure. A very full account of this village, its customs etc., is given in my predecessor's report forwarded with Kuwait letter No. 138, dated the 25th March 1908. Turkish suspicions were aroused by Major Knox's tour and he replied to an enquiry on the subject in Kuwait letter No. 257, dated the 23rd May 1908 ; both these letters have a bearing on the boundary and jurisdic tion question. I also visited this village in March 19 s 1 and found that the people still considered themselves as the subjects of the Shaikh of Kuwait. As a proof of the extent of Shaikh Mubarakh's influence I would add that I camped one day's march south of Anta'a with his nephews who were then spending the spring in the Abu Dhahir hills and valleys with the Kuwait standing army. Jazirat-al-Amayir.— Vide Lorimer's Gazetteer, Volume II, pages 940 and 1283. This name is that commonly used by Arabs to describe the Islands of Jinna and Musalamiya shown on the charts. The islands lie nearly due east of Anta'a and in a sheltered bay which is resorted to by all the Kuwait pearling boats. In fact this bay may be considered the head-quarters of the Kuwait pearling fleet during the diving season. It is not resorted to by Bahrain and other divers, and though Bahrain and Darin are the actual markets for pearl dealers the Kuwait boats use Jinna and Musalamiya as their main provisioning base. There are wells with huts on both islands and the spot is in frequent touch with Anta'a, which is some two days' march distant. The inhabitants are fishermen in winter and collect firewood from the mainland for sale to the pearl- boats during the diving season; during this season they also become pearl-divers. The pearling community have always regarded these islands as within Mubarakh's jurisdiction until the arrival of the Turkish posts in 1902, of which I would observe in passing only one now remains, consisting of three men on Jinna island.7 As an influential Arab remarked to me, ' The islands (are ?) to Mubarakh but the Turks have taken one and put soldiers therein 1 '. The small islands of Qaru, Umm-al-Maradim, Kubbar, are all claimed by the Shaikh as lying off his territory. All however are barren and consist only of a rock knoll covered with sand; they are all uninhabited, contain no water and are not visited by boats. Falaikha Island— inhabited {vide Lorimer's Gazetteer, Volume II, pages 512-515) and unquestionably belongs to Kuwait, the present governor being Shaikh Mubarakh's own brother. Jabir-bin-Subah. Similarly the two outliers, Mas- chan and Uha islets, which are merely sandy knolls and uninhabited, belong to Falaikha and consequently to Kuwait. Bubi'yan and Warba Islands.—{Vide Lorimer's Gazetteer, Volume II, pages 324 and 1927). Both these islands are claimed by the Shaikh as part of his Kuwait territory from ancient times and that they are so regarded by local people is obvious from the report forwarded by my predecessor under Kuwait No. 295, dated the 9th June 1908. The evidence therein is as strong as it is possible to obtain from a wild, illiterate people such as the Arabs occupying the fishing grounds on these islands. The point remaining then for decision was whether Warba Island formed part of the mainland or of Bubiyan Island. There is no doubt that Mubarakh himself is convinced that Warba really does form part of Kuwait territory, and as we have recognized it as such by including a pre-emption clause relating to it in our Bundar Shwaikh Agreement, we should be in a very difficult position vis-A-vis Mubarakh were we now to throw doubt on his title. From Warba Island the Kuwait boundary may be taken to run along the Khor to Umm Kasr, but it must be remembered that the Shaikh also claims Jazirat-as-Suf Residency letter No. T-io, dated the 11th June 1905), which is ground lying opposite to Umm Kasr across the Khor on the mainland. 1 understand Jazirat-as-Suf to lie between two small creeks and to become an island only at high tides. General. —Having traversed the disputed boundaries, it will be convenient to treat the area enclosed as a whole. I may mention here that 1 have personally seen the whole of the land boundary described with the exception of some five miles in the vicinity of Umm Kasr and the actual line between Wabrah wells and Jazirat-al-Amayir, though I have visited Anta'a itself and toured through the surrounding country. All Arab Shaikhs base the territorial extent of their power upon their ability to maintain or enforce some order over the adjacent tribes, their power to enforce the payment of ' zikat' by Bedouin and their capacity to prevent and to avenge outrages and raids within the territorial limits claimed. Judged by these stand ards there can be no question that Mubarakh is the paramount chief within the limits described. He levies ' zikat ' from the Awazim, who are practically a Kuwait tribe, the whole of the Umtair excepting two or three distant sections is Nejd, most of the Ajman, the Bani Khalid and until lately also from the Dhafir. It may be contended that though paramount as an Arab Chief his position may still be within Turkish suzerainty. If any such right ever existed (which is denied in toto), I would urge that there is no evidence of its ever having been exercised or recognised within the limits described or acknowledged by the tribes noted above. The comparatively recent occupation of a few points by petty Turkish detachments is regarded universally among the Arabs as an encroachment, the posts have only existed on sufferance and the men garrison ing them cannot, after 10 years of occupation, venture beyond sight of their walls. If it be held that so ineffective an occupation, continually protested against by the Shaikh it may be added, can give the Turkish Government any rights over-riding those exercised by local independent chiefs for many genera tions, and i£ we should acquiesce in the Turkish assertion of their so-called sovereign rights over Kuwait so far as to reduce materially the Kuwait boun daries indicated above, I confess I regard with profound misgiving the effect likely to be produced upon our own relations with Shaikh Mubarakh when the matter has to be explained to him. As he has often said, he regards the British8 lIJcdL UCLWCCIJ I li ^ov_/ ^ w — — ^ i i 'l 1* f plv daily to Kathama, from the vicinity of which most of the building stone tor Kuwait is brought; that the Shaikh and other Kuwait people keep their horses and maintain gardens at Jahra, whilst market produce is daily brought into Kuwait from the place ; that the Shaikh's drinking-water as well as that tor this Political Agency is brought daily from Sirra and the townspeople make the place and its vicinity a picnic resort. Again it is contended that the Shaikh s influence does not extend beyond ' 20 kilometres, i.e., to the limits of the territory occupied by the great Ajman tribe'. In the first place the Ajman tribe cannot approach for grazing purposes within 100 miles of Kuwait without the Shaikh's express permission ; secondly, the Shaikh levies ' zikat ' from this tribe ; thirdly, he has more than once imprisoned their Shaikhs for misbehaviour and at the present moment he has some 25 representatives of various sections of this tribe in prison in Kuwait, including the Shaikh of the Safran section; fourthly, on the death of Mahomed al Hithlain in the spring of 1910, the selection of a suc cessor to the chief shaikhship of the Ajman was made by Mubarakh, {yide Kuwait News for week ending 13th April 1910)- this occasion the Shaikh of every section of the Ajman tribe came to Kuwait and I personally happened to be present when it was decided by Mubarakh in a conference that Fahad and Thaidan al Hilhlain should succeed Mahomed. If the rest of the Turkish reply anent Kuwait shows the same extraordinary ignorance (to use no stronger term) of existing facts, I venture to think that Shaikh Mubarakh's side of the case as presented by this Political Agency at least merits acceptance until the Turkish Government can lead evidence which can be truly so described in place of the wild unsupported assertions which so far seem to have formed the basis of their claims. In point of fact the Turks have no first-hand knowledge of the interior nor of the tribes over whom they claim authority. Statement of Othman bin Mahomed al Ateybi, aged about 55 years, at present residing in Kuwait. Over two years ago I left Safwan where my family had been settled from my forefathers' time. We left the place because when the soldiers came they began to oppress us and worry us with demands for the few things we grew. We came originally from Nejd and I am really from the Ateyba tribe. I do not know when my forefathers came to Safwan, but it was very long ago; I was actually born in Kuwait but worked at the gardens in Safwan from when I was quite a small boy. There were about 15 huts in the place all belonging to our Nejd people. We cultivated grain, wheat and barley and vegetables. We had no regular payments to make to any one but it was upon us to look after Shaikh Mubarakh's cattle, sheep, camels etc., when they were in our vicinity and we had to draw the water and maintain the wells in order for him. Two years ago there W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, Captain, Political Agent, Kuwait, States:o o was a man of ours killed by a shot from the Turkish fort and we then left the place. We always regarded the place as part of Mubarakh's ' dira ' and our selves as his servants. Read over and acknowledged as correct. W. H.

States: We left Safwan some 2 or 3 years ago, as the result of a man of our's being killed by a shot from the Turkish Fort. The soldiers said one of us had fired at them but it was not true. When that happened we asked leave of Mubarakh to free us of our duties to him at Safwan and let us return to Kuwait. Most of us had homes in Kuwait too and only lived in Safwan for tillage purposes at the right seasons. The date palms belong to the Nakib of Busreh, but we used to look after them. I believe after waiting for a year for us to come back he has put other men of his own into the place to look after the palms. Our occupation was to raise wheat, barley, and vegetables, and look after the Shaikh's people when they were in the vicinity as they often used to be in those days before the Turks came. We did all the watering of the animals and such like work. Until the soldiers came, nobody worried us and all matters were referred to Kuwait for settlement. When we left the place no one went there for a long time, and as far as I know, there is nothing done in the agricultural way there now. K uwait ; Dated the 12th August igi2 .] Read over and acknowledged as correct. W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, Captain, Political Agent. Statement of Nasir bin Musa, Ateybi, an old man of quite 60 years. States : I have been in Safwan since I was a boy, but have been now for the last two years or more living in Kuwait. We left Safwan because the soldiers contin ually oppressed us and finally killed one of our men. The incident came about thus: A Turkish soldier came from the fort and wanted to enter one of our huts— my uncle's son's hut—and he of course told him to go away and tried to prevent the soldier entering; there were words and then the soldier shot him. His name was Mahomed, and he was a boy of only 15 years. We complained to Shaikh Mubarakh as he was our Shaikh and he said we had better leave the place altogether, and this we then did ; all of us came and settled for good in Kuwait where most of us also had homes before. We were in a way servants to Shaikh Mubarakh at Safwan ; passed on strangers and messengers, and provided lodging, food and water for his men and looked after his cattle. Our occupation ordinarily was the raising of wheat, barley, vegetables and such like for our needs, whilst we also looked after the date trees of the Nakib of Busreh. When we left the place there was no one left there except the soldiers. Read over and acknowledged as correct. W. H. I. SHAKESPEAR, Captain, Political Agent.

If it is the former which you desire, I would venture to suggest that a copy of Kiepert's sectional map D-4 Adana would give the names of all the places men tioned in my despatch No. 379 of the 3rd ultimo with the exception of Mamouret, which is not indicated. I would also suggest that the War Office be applied to for more detailed maps of the country, of which I believe they are in possession. If, however, you desire a trace of the line itself, I will endeavour to obtain one locally, either here or at Adana, though I am not altogether sanguine of success. I have, etc., GERAED LOWTHER.

[26563.] Mr. Lynch to Mr. Maxwell.—[Received June 22). 33 Pont Street, London, June 21, 1912. D ear M r . M axwell, Reverting to our conversation of yesterday, I enclose a paper which I read last year before the Central Asian Society* and would beg to refer you to pp. 9 and 10, which have reference to the branch line * Not printed. between Baghdad (Sadijeh) and Khanakin. The Baghdad-Khanakin trade route into Persia has been developed exclusively by Englishmen, practically by members of my own family, and the value of British goods conveyed by this route amounts to over 1,000,000Z. a year—a figure which compares with under 100,000L for the trade of all other European countries, includ ing Germany. I think you will admit that I have a hereditary claim to put in a word for the future of this British trade. I do hope that our Government will do their very ut most to safeguard this trade and also the trade between Trebizond and Tabreez. It is true that the Baghdad Railway Company, having secured the surplus of the Ottoman Public Debt, are probably in a position to complete the railway to Bagh dad and the Persian frontier. But I understand that the greater part of the rail way bonds are still in the safes of the Deutsche Bank, and naturally the German promoters are most anxious to get tjiese bonds taken up in France and England. I am certain, therefore, that they would stretch a good many points in order to se cure the goodwill of England and France. Now, for us it is vital to obtain an effective voice in the management of the line between Baghdad and the Persian frontier. Baghdad is already the terminus of our river-borne trade; it will soon be connected with the Mediterranean by the Baghdad-Mosul line, and later probably by a line along the Euphrates. Baghdad is, therefore, destined to be the reservoir into which several main streams of com merce will pour. The bulk of the goods will be goods in transit for Persia, and it is of the utmost importance that perfectly equal treatment should be secured for British goods as compared with goods from Germany or other countries. This can only be secured by financial participation in the branch from Baghdad to the Per sian frontier. Nor can I see why the Germans should refuse such participation. It would greatly help them to have Great Britain on their side in the efforts which they will have to make sooner or later to keep the door open in Persia by this route. I do, therefore, trust that this proposal may be pressed in any negotiations with Germany over the Baghdad Railway question.As regards the proposed railway from Baghdad down the Tigris, I am still at a loss to discover what objects this railway is to serve, unless it be purely strategical objects in relation to the British position on the Persian Gulf. It is surely obvious that all the military requirements of Turkey in policing the Arab tribes between Baghdad and Basrah and in those regions would be met by steamier transport. The fact that I am engaged in promoting a railway up the valley of the Karun goes to show, I hope, that the opinion I have formed of a railway between Basrah and Baghdad is not influenced by private considerations. Eiver transport can look after itself alongside of a railway. But if our Government is to be asked to support a railway it ought surely to be made clear that there will be some commercial gain. If the railway is to be built as the result of a further 3 per cent, increase of the cus toms duties, the result, so far as Manchester goods are concerned, will be that they will have to submit to an additional tax of 60s. a-ton in order to have the luxury of an alternative route up to Baghdad. Under these circumstances, it would surely be better to go slow as regards this railway and to await the developments of irri gation. Any other course would result in the squandering of vast sums of money raised at the expense of the Turkish tax-payer without conferring any benefits upon British trade—rather the contrary. Yours sincerely, H. F. B. LYNCH. (Copy sent informally to the Army Department for transmission to the Divi sion of the Chief of the Staff.)

S ir, In the course ofsconversation with the German Ambassador to-day, I said that I was sure he knew m^re about the Baghdad Railway than I did ; but I should like to tell him how mattery stood, so that I might'be certain that my version of some points was correct. The Turkish Government claimed that, as the concession beyond Baghdad had been given back to them by^Germany in return for the Alexandretta concession, they were entitled to negotiate Xbout it; and they desired that, while we negotiated with them, we should not negotiate with any one else. On this footing we were negotiating; but I understood that Germany, though relinquishing to Turkey the concession beyond Baghdad, had reserved the right to an equal participation with any other individual foreign capital. The Ambassador said that the correct, way of expressing the situation was that the Baghdad Railway Company had agreed to transfer the concession beyond Baghdad to another company, but German participation must be as great as that of any other capital, except Turkish, and some^indemnity was to be allowed to the Baghdad Railway Company for more difficult portions of the line ; but he did not disagree that, in substance, the Turkish Government were entitled to negotiate as they were doing. He added that he understood the Turks now proposed that the railway should stop at Basrah. I said that, as far as' that point was concerned, we \^ould acquiesce. The Ambassador then dwelt upon the Turkish objections to Russian capital, and said that they were natural, as Turkey suspected a political motive in every thing which Russia did. \ I replied that we were awareof these objections, and the quesWm of participa tion was not arranged. I proposed to continue negotiating with tfte Turks alone, as they desired ; but, if participation was arranged for the railway, theVatter would then of course have to be discussed with Germany, and in any case I would tell him if the negotiations broke down and came to nothing, or what the final resulVwas. 26 X /(iiecoived under Foreign Departwont endo.* • ^ment No.lSl^-E.-l. dated 12tli August 1913). ^ ^ ^ P.iiSOO. \ India uffice, Whitehall, -i-'ondon 1st July 1912.

His ..ajesty's Government have not failed to examine with much care and attention tne important propojals which are embodied in the memorandum communicated lyj the imperial Ottoman uovernment on tne 15th April last. 2. xhroughout their deliberations, iAis M';. jesty 1 s Govern-nant have been animated by tn . ;onviction that a complete a^reemexit on outatanciing questions i3 eniinently to be deaired in the larger interejta of both countries. Thoy are persuaded that ouch an agreement, to be justly ap preciated, should be vivj./ed not only In the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty 's Go vernment therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Go vernment the following proposals and considerat ions;- 3. For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may be dealt with under three distinct headingsJ - (i) The Baghdad Railway question. x x x x{ii) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in tlie region of the Persian Gulf. {Hi) An increase from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem in the Turkish customs duties. f (i) The Baghdad Railway question. 4. The interest, which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse a region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total ex ports and imports, is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty's Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner in which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and-a-half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Basrah ; they have recalled that, up to a recent date, no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Basrah was British; and they have con sistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Baghdad Railway ques tion was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties, 5. The magnitude of these commercial interests also clearly rendered it desir able that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section of the Baghdad Railway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty's Government find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circumstances His Majesty's Government, anxious to prove to the Otto man Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive under standing without undue delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation in the railway from Baghdad to Basrah. 6. It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty's Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. His Majesty's Govern ment consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to. lay down the following conditions as essential to that end ia) An arrangement, as set forth in the accompanying draft convention, w o for the exclusion of dilteren- Draft Convention (]). ^ trea t m ent on all railways in Asiatic Turkey, as well as an undertaking explained in a separate paper as to the treatment of certain British imports. (h) The admission of two British representatives to the board of whatever company may undertake the administration of the railway from Baghdad to Basrah. (c) The terminus of the railway to be at Basrah. {d) No railway to be continued beyond Basrah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty's Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. (e) A convention to be signed, on the basis of the accompanying draft, for the future conservancy of Draft Convention (2). U the Shatt-el-Arab. (/) An undertaking that the number of British vessels navigating between Baghdad and Basrah shall be increased to six. (ii) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. 7. His Majesty's Government have learnt with some disappointment of the attitude of the Imperial Ottoman Government in regard to El Katr and Kuwait; nevertheless they do not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the 31 C326ED32 important sacrifice made by His Majesty's Government m the matter of British participation in the Baghdad Eailway, and that they will meet that sacrifice by a corresponding modification of the views set forth m the Turkish memorandum of the ISth April. 8. His Maiesty's Government must, in the first instance, protest against the contention that there is a misunderstanding with regard to the assurance given, and repeatedly given, to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, to the ettect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrain, Maskat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the 1 ersian uult. 9. The original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign O ce, and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy. 10. His Majesty's Government are unable to admit that any of the arguments adduced in the Turkish memorandum in any way invalidates the statement that south of Ojeir, in the district of El Katif, there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; and they are fully persuaded that El Katr has never been locally regarded as forming a part of, or indeed as being subject to the innuence of, the Ottoman Empire. Attention is invited to the accompanying paper respecting El Katr. 11. His Majesty's Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula of El Katr, including El Bidaa. They have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itself so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition, in the interests of the Shaikh of Bahrain, of the pearl fishery, and of the successful suppression of the arms traffic. 12. The Turkish memorandum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty s Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Kuwait. His Majesty s Government are concerned to ensure the continuation of the local government of the Shaikh of Kuwait, which incontestably forms part of the status quo, and, while they are not prepared to agree to their conventions with the Shaikh being super seded, they none the less would be willing to agree to their being confirmed by, and thus to meet the wishes of, the Ottoman Government. Further His Majesty's Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Kuwait and indeed to recognise the Shaikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Kuwait, to the withdrawal of the Turkish military post from Bubiyan, and to a recognition of the limits of Kuwait in accordance with the indications contained in the accompany- Memorandum. ing memorandum. 13. His Majesty's Government regret that they would consider the introduc tion of divided responsibility for maritime police measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their policy in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the martime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the system in these circumstances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed His Majesty's Government would go further. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf ; and they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative; and it was this attitude which led to the declara tion made by the Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that ' His Majesty's-Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal.'33 15. His Majesty's Government have no wish to formulate excessive demands. Their desire is simply to ensure the continuance of an order of things which has been proved by experience to favour the development of trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which, but for long-sustained British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and bloodshed. 16. They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government will not oppose the continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years, and they look forward confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the improved relations which cannot fail to ensue. 17. As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a question which has caused some concern to His Majesty's Government in recent months, that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah. When His Majesty's Government addressed their memorandum of July 1911 to the Ottoman Government that question had been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty's Government had no desire to raise it. They feel, however, that no settlement could be complete which did not provide for this question, and they will have the honour to submit forthwith a separate Memorandum. memorandum on the subject for the con sideration of the Ottoman Government. (iii) An increase from 11 'per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem in the Turkish customs duties. 18. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to conclude an agreement in the sense of this memorandum, and to concur in the removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt, then, subject to the assent of the other Powers, His Majesty's Government will consent to the further increase of the Turkish customs for a period of seven years from April 1914, and they will also agree to the continued levy of the existing 3 per cent, customs increase for a similar period. ANNEX. E l K atr. • His Majesty's Government maintain that prior to Midhat Pasha's expedi tion there were on the Arabian Coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish officials, no Turkish jurisdiction or occupation, effective or ineffective. To show the actual state of things as regards Katr at that date they may quote the follow ing selection of evidence from a report, dated the 21st August, 1829, from an Indian naval (not political) officer, and from other contemporary records, and it will be observed that, there being no question then between the British and Turkish Gov ernments, these reports, which were made by officers in the pursuit of their ordinary duties, are necessarily impartial:— Captain G. B. Brucks, writing on the 21st August, 1829, furnished the follow ing report:— ' Al Bidder {El Bidaa) : The people are mostly fishermen. They are sub ject to Bahrain. c&lt; Al Owhale {Hawaileh) is subject to Bahrain. ' Ruwais : The inhabitants are subject to Bahrain. ' Y oss fee*. A small village belonging to Bahrain. ' Khar Hassan : Belongs to Bahrain. ' Feyraha : Belongs to Bahrain. ' Zobara : The inhabitants are subject to Bahrain. ' Wardens Island : Belongs to Bahrain. ' Isle of Zucnonee (Zakhnuniyeh): The inhabitants acknowledge the authority of the Shaikh of Bahrain.'34 The following extracts are also from contemporary records In 1827 : ' A piracy was committed by Obed, an inhabitant of Bidaa, a Bahrain dependency.' In 1828 : ' The Chief of Bidaa, making a murderous attack on a native, was placed in confinement by his feudal superior the Chief of Bahrain).' Again, writing on the 1st January, 1854, Captain (afterwards General Sir Arnold) Kemball, whose name is well-known at Constantinople, wrote ' The Chief of Bahrain is independent. The territory of Bahrain consists of the two islands known by that name, and the line of coast extend ing from the bottom of the bight in which they are situated to Khor- al-Adeed, on the other side of the promontory of Has Tanoorah. As to the population of the dependencies of Bahrain on the Guttur Coast no correct estimate can be formed.' In a letter, dated the 29th December, 1843, the ex-Chiei of Bahrain wrote : ' When, therefore, my subjects who inhabit the Guttur {El Katr) Coast perceived,' etc. ! According to the official records of the British Government the following is- the position with regard to Bahrain and El Katr :— In the latter half of the eighteenth century the Uttobees (an independent tribe), having settled at Zobara and ejected the Persians from Bahrain, became paramount there. In 1851 the Wahabee Ameer established a governor at Et Bidaa, and threatened to occupy the Bahrain Islands. But peace was concluded in the same year, and the town of El Bidaa was restored to the Bahrain chief. Disagreements between the latter and his dependents on El Katr peninsula were settled by British intervention in 1868. In that year Her Majesty's Government also concluded an agreement with Muhammad-bin-Thani, Shaikh of El Katr. As soon as Midhat Pasha's expedition, was heard of, the British Ambassador protested to the Grand Vizier in person on the 3rd April, 1871, and these protests were repeated by M. Pisani on the 25th April and 15th May. In return, explicit assurances were given by the Grand Vizier, which satisfied Her Majesty's Government, and they were repeated by Server Pasha on the 18th January, 1872. They were referred to by the British political officer in a communication to Midhat Pasha, who did not himself, nor did the Turkish Government, dispute them. In 1871 a deputation was sent by the commander of the Turkish troops to induce Jasim, Muhammad-bin-Thani's son, to accept the Turkish flag. Muham mad, at that time old and infirm, did not approve of this step, and continued to, fly the Arab flag over his own house. It was in 1876 that Shaikh Jasim was first appointed kaimakam by the Turkish Government, his father having died in 1878., In 1881 Shaikh Jasim, however, renewed, orally, the agreement of 1868 with the British Government, the Shaikh undertaking, inter alia, to refer his disagreements, with neighbouring Shaikhs to the British Eesident at Bushire. In 1882, Jasim having harassed certain Indian traders, the Government of India compelled him to pay an indemnity and to apologise, on pain of instant hostilities. The Sublime Porte protesting, Lord Granville informed Musurus Pasha on the 7th May, 1883, that the claims of the Porte to rights of sove reignty over the Katr coast had never been admitted by Her Majesty's Govern ment,' and this attitude has been maintained consistently ever since. The events which took place in 1893 in the vicinity of El Katr and the affair of Misaimir are well, known.to the Turkish Government. The incident was closed by Shaikh Ahmed (who had been appointed by Shaikh Jasim plenipotentiary) having an interview with the British Resident, and asking to be allowed to renew in writing the 1868 agreement. Again in 1898 and 1899 Shaikh Ahmed asked to be allowed to enter into closer relations with the British Government.As regards the local recognition of Turkish authority in Katr, two facts may be cited:— 1. Herr H. Burchardt, one of the only two Europeans who has travelled through El Hasa, wrote in 1906 :— ' Die Tiirkei beansprucht noch das Gebiet von Odeid mit Wakare und die Insel Delna; in Wirklichkeit reicht ihr Einfluss nicht weiter, als Gewehre und Kanonen tragen. Steuern erhebt die Pforte hier nicht.' 2. In 1908, when the Bu Ainan tribe wished to settle at Zobara, they applied for permission not to the Turkish authorities, but to the Shaikh of Bahrain. (Received on 29th July 1912, with Political Secretary's letter No. 28, dated 12th July 1912.) Immediate and Confidential. ; I ndia O ffice, P. 2613. ? ' 8th July 1912. S ir, r : I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 28322, dated the 4th instant, forwarding the draft of a memo randum respecting the negotiations now in progress with the Turkish Government which the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs proposes to communicate to the Turkish Ambassador. As Sir E. Grey is aware, the Marquess of Crewe holds the view that British participation in the Baghdad-Basrah railway is desirable in the political, strategical, and commercial interests of this country, provided that thereby British control, in whatever guise, of the construction and administration of the line can be effec tively secured; but on that condition only. Understanding, therefore, that for reasons which Sir E. Grey is satisfied are sufficient, it is no longer possible to obtain participation on that condition. His Lordship is disposed to think that it is prefer able to withdraw opposition to the construction of the railway without British parti cipation, and by making (under suitable safeguards) this valuable concession to the Turkish Government to establish a claim to the acceptance by them of our proposals regarding the Persian Gulf in their entirety. He, therefore, concurs generally in the terms of the draft, and is. of opinion that the conditions therein laid down are such that Great Britain can safely stand aloof from the railway scheme. A memorandum is enclosed containing a few suggestions on points of detail; also a marked map showing the approx- Copy with Political 2613/1912. imate of Kuwait) and a d S cr ip. tive note. Lord Crewe is inclined to doubt the advisability of appending to the memo randum a note on El Katr. It will not convince the Turks, and it may only pro voke a reply. If, however. Sir E. Grey thinks that some rejoinder to the Turkish case is absolutely necessary, his Lordship concurs in the annex proposed, which (he understands) has already been communicated privately to the Turkish repre sentatives. He is not aware of the nature of the ' separate paper as to the treatment of certain British imports ' referred to in paragraph 6 {a), but he assumes that it re lates entirely to the matter in hand. He would be strongly averse from extending the scope of the present negotiations to questions connected with tariffs in general or the treatment of British cotton goods in particular. In conclusion. Lord Crewe wo aid suggest that when this memorandum is com municated to the Turkish Government it should be made unmistakeably plain that it represents in principle the last word of His Majesty's Government. He is aware that Sir E. Grey is of opinion that it may be necessary to accept modifica tions in detail. But while it would, of course, be inadvisable to indicate even so 3536 mU ch in advance, it is—in his view—-Gssential that the Tnrkisli Oovernmont should clearly understand from the first that the general framework of the proposals must be accepted or rejected as a whole. I have the hdnour to be. S ir, Your most obedient Servant, R. RITCHIE. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. ENCLOSURES. E nclosure N o. 1.

Paragraph 4. —It seems undesirable to hint, as the words 'up (? down) to a recent date ' do, that British steam tonnage is declining. Would it not be better to give the actual figure for last year ? The Board of Trade would furnish it exact ly—it is apparently about 81 per cent. Paragraph 5. —It is noted that only commercial interests are mentioned. In order to present the full magnitude of the sacrifice His Majesty's Government are making, it would be necessary to mention our political and even strategical inter ests. Possibly this is thought inexpedient. In that case the first two lines might run : ' The magnitude of Great Britain's manifold interests clearly render it de^ sirable (The meaning of ' also ' in the text is obscure and it might be omit ted.) Four lines from end of paragraph, omit 'undue'. Paragraph 6 (e). —It might be well to add at the end:—' This convention must oe read in conjunction with a memorandum—which, as stated below, will shortly be communicated to the Porte—on the subject of the frontier of Muhammerah.'

And while they are now prepared to recognise Turkish sovereignty between the southernmost limits of Kuwait (as hereinafter defined) and Ojeir, they are unable to admit that any of the arguments,' etc. And the following sentence' might be added at the end of the paragraph:— ' For themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the Turkish assurances mentioned above, they have never so regarded it, and they have repeatedly inform ed the Porte accordingly.' Paragraph 11, last three lines. —It seems unnecessary to say why we are bound to continue to oppose, and a statement of reasons may provoke a rejoinder or counter proposals. Paragraph 12, line 8. —After ' Kuwait ' insert ' (as defined in their memo randum of 29th July 1911).'The views of the Government of India on the suggestion that our agreements with the Shaikh should be confirmed by the Porte have not yet been received. It would be better if this'could be held in reserve. Paragraph 14. —After this insert:—' His Majesty's Government must there fore ask the Turkish Government to recognise the right of Great Britain in the Persian Gulf {a) to control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (6) to police its waters ; and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements. Paragraph 15 might begin: —' In submitting these final proposals for the accept ance of the Turkish Government His Majesty's Government are not seeking terri torial aggrandizement nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simply to secure the recognition and to ensure the continu ance of an order of things which has in fact grown up under their auspices and has been proved by experience,' etc. Paragraph 17. —For the last sentence substitute :—' Now, however, that it has been raised, by circumstances beyond their control, they feel that no settlement in the Persian Gulf could be complete which did not provide for this question, and they regard a satisfactory adjustment of it as an essential part of the present ne gotiations. They will, accordingly, have the honour to submit forthwith a separate memorandum on the subject for the consideration of the Ottoman Government.' E nclosure N o . 2. L imits of K uwait. Descriptive note to accompany map. His Majesty's Government consider the frontier on the north to be a line run ning from Khor-as-Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwan to Jabal Sanam and thence to the Batin. On the south his boundary is considered to run westwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to the Na'airiyah hill at the north-western corner of Eadaif. On the west the Shaikhdom is bounded between Jabal Sanam and Hafar by the Batin, and south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Summan from Dahanah as far south as the point where that line is intersected by the route from Wabrah to Riyadh. Districts and Islands—The Shaikhdom, considered from the physical point of view, falls naturally into two parts, one to the north and the other to the south of a line joining Kuwait town and Kiqa'i. In the northern block lie the districts or tracts of Batin, Shiqqaq, Batih, Umm-al-Khilan, Yah, Qira-d-Marru,, Zaqlah, and Zor. The southern block comprises the three great divisions of Summan, Dibdibah, and Umm-Janaib ; and the last, which lies along the coast to the south of Kuwait Bay, is further sub-divided into districts named Shaqq, Qra'ab Adan, Slau, Hazaim, and Sudah. i The maritime possessions of Kuwait consist of the islands of Bubiyan, War- ba and Failakah which, with its northern and southern outliers of Mashjan and Auhah, is situated at the mouth of Kuwait Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar, Qaru, and Umm-al-Maradim.n Q r ■ ' r t f ' ' X C^ : - 1 ^v^'- Urgent. ^ iT^ No. £#f/ •E.A.

From information recently received it would appear that the Baghdad Railway Company are meeting with some difficulty in connection with the purchase of land at Basrah for accommodation of railway material and other similar purposes. In the month of May His Majesty's consul at Basrah reported to me that Meiss- ner Pasha had bought a piece of land near Magil, of about 16 acres in extent, for storing Baghdad Railway material, and was endeavouring to have it registered, in his own name. But the German consul at Basrah now informs Mr. Crow that the Vali of Basrah is contesting the German proprietary rights to the land, that diffi culties have therefore been raised to its registration and that w ork on it has been stopped pending the receipt of instructions from Constantinople. There has apparently been some idea of further land purchase by the German company along the river and of their hiring certain intervening river frontage ground. This has led the Turks to consider that they might possibly wish to build docks there eventually, and the vali has therefore made the acquisition of the land by the Germans conditional upon any subsequent naval arrangements of the Turk ish Government.

The Baghdad Railway Company agrees to appoint Messrs, Lynch Brothers to run and manage the steamers and lighters leased to the Baghdad Railway Company by the Societe de transports fluviaux en Orient for the transport of rail way material on the rivers Tigris, Euphrates, Shatt-el-Arab and their tributaries in Turkish Arabia, until the conclusion of the transport of the Baghdad Railway Company material from Basrah, but only as long as the ships are leased by the Societe. J 2. Messrs. Lynch Brothers are to supply at their own expense all the crews necessary material and fuel for the running of the steamers and ligthters and are to pay for their upkeep, supervision and management during the above-mentioned period, xhe Baghdad Railway Company are to appear as purchasers of all such material and fuel.3.

Lynch Brothers undertake to run the steamers and barges in such a manner as to transport from Basrah to Baghdad the railway material required by the Baghdad Railway Company at the rate as near as may be of 2,500—3 500 tons per month and, m the event of a minimum quantity of 2,000 tons not being delivered m any one month, excepting for causes hereinafter mentioned, the Bagh dad Railway Company have the right to deduct 3 Rs. per ton from the rate agreed on the amount of material short delivered. • + tl M r S ff- L r cl1 ^ rothers a g ree t0 receiv e as much material as is possible into the lighters from the sea steamers or from shore at Basrah, but they do not undertake to receive a larger quantity than 4,000 tons in one month and stipulate that not less than 3,000 tons per month should always be at Basrah every month. The Baghdad Railway Company undertake to arrange with the agents or owners of sea steamers bringing the material to Basrah that the lighters should be loaded under the orders and directions of the officers of Messrs Lynch Brothers m order to prevent barges being improperly loaded for towing Should delay arise out of the agents or officers of the sea steamers not complying with this arrangement Messrs. Lynch Brothers would be absolved from responsibility and the Baghdad Railway Company undertake to pay for any extra expenses arising out of such cause. In case the Baghdad Railway Company should desire Messrs Lynch Brothers to undertake the transhipment, Messrs. Lynch Brothers shall* perform this work at the rate of 2-3 per ton. In case any storage should be re quired, such storage is to be charged at actual cost. 5. Messrs.

With regard to the specification, I am to say that Sir E.

Should there, however, be more than a few days' delay, he considers that the reply to the Turkish Govern ment should be dispatched without awaiting any longer the views of the Government of India on this point. He understands that the Board of Trade will shortly furnish the proposed draft convention for the exclusion of differential treatment, and he would suggest, for the consideration of the Marquess of Crewe, that time might be gained if the expert department of your Office were to enter into direct communi cation with the Board of Trade respecting the dralt convention. As to the draft convention for the Shatt-el-Arab, Sir E.

I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th July, forwarding the draft of a memorandum respecting negotiations now pending with the Turkish Government, which Sir E. Grey proposes to com municate to the Turkish Ambassador, and to return the draft herewith^ with certain amendments, indicated in red ink*, which they desire to suggest for Sn E. Grey's consideration. With regard to the several amendments, I am to point out that the words 'from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem' have been deleted from (iii) of the third paragraph of the draft and from the heading to section (iii), since the effect of the proposal for the special treatment of British cotton manufactures, set out m the amended form of section (iii), will be to limit the rate of customs duty to something less than 15 per cent, in the case of an important item in the Turkish import trade. The addition of certain words at the end of the fifth paragraph of the draft has been suggested with a view to emphasising the close relation between the with drawal of the British claim Ito participate in the railway between Baghdad and Basrah and the other proposals dealt with in the memorandum. In view of the amended form of section (iii) now suggested, the words deleted from (a) of the sixth paragraph appear unnecessary. The Board think it advisable to indicate in (6) of the same paragraph the necessity of the British representatives upon the board of the railway from Baghdad to Basrah being approved by His Majesty's Government, and they are also disposed to suggest that, should Sir E. Grey see no objection, this opportunity should be taken to direct the attention of the Turkish Government to the desirability of British representation upon the board of the Baghdad Railway proper. Finally, section (iii) of the draft has been amended so as to indicate more pre cisely the attitude of His Majesty's Government towards the proposed increase of the Turkish customs tariff. I am, at the same time, to forward to you herewith the draft of a railway con vention for submission, with Sir E. Grey's concurrence, to the Ottoman Government, and to state that the proposed schedule of cotton duties will be forwarded to you at the earliest possible date. I am, etc., H. LLEWELLYN SMITH. ♦Printed in erased type and italics,E nclosure in N o. 1. Draft of Memorandum to he communicated to Turkish Ambassador. 1. His Majesty's Government have not failed to examine with much care and attention the important proposals which are embodied in the memorandum com municated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last. 2. Throughout their deliberations, His Majesty's Government have been ani mated by the conviction that a complete argeement on outstanding questions is eminently to be desired in the larger interests of both countries. They are persuad ed that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty's Government therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Govern ment the following proposals and considerations :— ,• 3. For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may be dealt with under three distinct headings:— {%) The Baghdad Railway question. {ii) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. {Hi) An increase feom U per eent. to par eent. od valorem in the Turkish customs duties. (&amp;) The Baghdad Railway Question. 4. The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse a region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total ex ports and imports is indeed so obvious as to call for^ little comment. His Majesty's Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner in which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Basrah; they have recalled that no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Basrah was British; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Baghdad Railway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase iu the Turkish customs duties. 5. The magnitude of Great Britain's manifold interests clearly renders it desir able that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section of the Baghdad Railway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty's Gov ernment find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circumstances His Majesty's Government, anxious to prove to the Otto man Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive understand ing without delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for Brit ish participation in the railway from Baghdad to Basrah, if a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the other ^points enumerated in this memorandum. 6. It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty's Government were at the same time able to show that British inter ests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. His Majesty's Government consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the following conditions as essential to that end:— (a) An arrangement, as set forth in the accompanying draft convention, for the Draft exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey frs well as vention, n a qvtiIq iripr] irj j: gf&gt; T&gt; yt 'o ixaxitir Q c to ■f. }) o of prM'f') in T? ri-f- i-iV .

In addition, His Majesty's Government consider it highly desirable in the interests of the smooth working of the arrangements that at least one British director, approved by them, should be admitted to the Board of the Baghdad Railway Company. 59 C357FD(c) The terminus of the railway to be at Basrah. (d) No railway to be continued beyond Basrah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement vath His Majesty's Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. Draft Con- (e) A convention to be signed, on the basis of the accompanying draft, for the V (AmQx 3.) future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. This convention must be read in conjunc tion with a memorandum—which, as stated below, will shortly be communicated to the Porte—on the subject of the frontier of Muhammerah. (/) An undertaking that permission should be given for three British steamers to navigate between Baghdad and Basrah in addition to the number already allowed. (n) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the .j I* Persian Gulf. 7. His Maj esty's Government note with satisfaction that the Turkish Government renounce their claims to Bahrain on conditions which there should be no difficulty in accepting, but they have learnt with disappointment the attitude of the Imperial Ottoman Government in regard to El Katr and Kuwait; nevertheless they do not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the important sacrifice made by His Majesty's Government in the matter of British participation in the Baghdad Railway, and that they will meet that sacrifice by a corresponding modification of the views set forth in the Turkish memorandum of the 15th April. 8. His Majesty's Government must, in the first instance, protest against the contention that there is a misunderstanding with regard to the assurance given, and repeatedly given, to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrain, Maskat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. 9. The original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office, and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy. . l ®- Hls Majesty's Government maintain that prior toMidhat Pasha's expedi- tion there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish jurisdiction or occupation, effective or ineffective, And while they are now pre- Annex 4. to . re cogmse Turkish sovereignty between the southernmost limits of Kuwait, (as hereinafter defined) and Ojeir, they are unable to admit that any of the areu- ments adduced in the Turkish memorandum in any way invalidates the statement that south of Ojeir, m the district of El Katif, there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; and they are fully persuaded that El Katr has never been locally regarded as forming part of, or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire. * For themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the Turkish assur ances mentioned above, they have never so regarded it, and they have repeatedly iniormed the Sublime Porte accordingly. 11 ■ H ( . is v , M , a]eSty l? G r rn T ! nent cal1 onl y reiter ate their opinion that any lasting the 0^«n e w Wef!? ftr Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula of El Katr, including El Bidaa. They have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first opposition a 80 reCent,y m0 ' and they are bound t0 contiaue that 12. The Turkish memorandum of the I5th April does not afford His Maiesty's Government all the information which they consider essential to a due apmeia- tion of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Kuwait. His Majesty's fhTh orKi^r'Tfi t0 /' S T ? he con «— of the local government of the bhaikh of Kuwait, as defined m their memorandum of the 29th July 1911 which mcontestab y forms part of the status Further, His Majesty's Government rTcoinke ShXhl ^T ^^l 6 ^ 0Ver Kuwait -deS to reco D nise the Shaikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance 6061 11 to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being admitted by Turkey to be within the con- Memo- fines of Kuwait, to the withdrawal of the Turkish military post from Bubiyan, and randum * to a recognition of the limits of Kuwait in accordance with the indications contain- (Armex 4,) ed in the accompanying memorandum. 13. His Majesty's Government regret that they would consider the introduction of divided responsibility for maritime police measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their policy in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the system in these circumstances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed His Majesty's Government would go further. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf; they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative; and it was this attitude which led to the declaration made by the Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the 5th May 1903, that 'His Majesty's Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal.' His Majesty's Government must therefore ask the Turkish Government to recognise in the Persian Gulf the right of Great Britain— {a) to control surveying, lighting, buoying and pilotage; ip) to police its waters; and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements. 15. In submitting these final proposals for the acceptance of the Turkish Gov ernment, His Majesty's Government are not seeking territorial aggrandise ment, nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simply to secure the recognition and to ensure the continuance of an order of things which, in fact, grew up under their auspices and before the appearance of Turkish authority in the Persian Gulf, and which has been proved by experience to favour the development of trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which, but for long-sustained British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and bloodshed. 16. They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government will not oppose the continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years, and they look forward confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the im proved relations which cannot fail to ensue. 17. As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a question which has caused some concern to His Majesty's Government in recent months, that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the region of Muhammerah. When His Majesty's Government addressed their memorandum of July 1911 to the Ottoman Government that question had been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty's Government had no desire to raise it. Now. however, that it has been raised, by circumstances beyond their control, they feel that no settlement in the Persian Gulf could be complete which did not provide for this question, and they regard a satis factory adjustment of it as an essential part of the present negotiations. They Memo- have the honour to submit a separate memorandum on the subject for the con- randum. sideration of the Ottoman Government. (Annex 5.)

(Received on the 5th August 1912, with P the 19th July [A] ASIATIC T URKEY AND AEABIA. , [Ji'y 9 -] CONFIDENTIAL. T S ection 2. [Amended Copy.] [29225] No. 1. Joint letter addressed to Sir E Foreign Office, July 9, 1912. We have the honour to submit the accompanying amended draft of an Anglo- Turkish convention for the future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. We have, besides various other points, taken into careful consideration- the several comments made by the British Resident in the Persian Gulf and by the Government of India upon the original draft; but, in revising the convention, we have introduced amendments only in so far as they are consistent with the recognition of Turkish rights over the whole waterway. We understand that it is a primary object of His Majesty's Government and of the Turkish Government to exclude other Powers from representation on the commission, and that the objection of His Majesty's Government to such repre sentation is partly based upon the belief that it might be pleaded by the Powers who enjoyed it as a ground for intervention on their part in the control of police, and other matters of administration, in the Persian Gulf. The principal difficulty which presents itself undoubtedly lies in the possibi lity that foreign Powers, if not represented, may decline to allow dues, which will be necessary to meet the expenses of the commission, to be levied on their shipping. This difficulty is inevitable in the case of a country which is subject to the capitulations, and so long as Turkey desires to preserve the commission as a purely Turkish institution there must be some risk that foreign ships may escape payment of the dues. k J Nevertheless, we think an effort should be made to levy dues, and to provide by this means a revenue for the commission, and to do this in such manner as shaU give least ground for foreign objection. The difficulty arises from the absence of any method by which payment of the dues by ships can be enforced by judicial procedure. We do not think that Turkey's right to improve the navigation of her internal waterways or to charge reasonable dues on shipping in return can be doubted, but so long as the pay ment of such dues could only be enforced by proceedings in the consular court of the Power whose flag the ship flies there is no certainty that such proceedings would be effective. : i ,&lt; te'-l The risk can, in our opinion, be considerably reduced by the plan of levying one consolidated due to cover all heads of service rendered—lighting, buoying, dredging, pilotage, wharves, etc., because ships would in almost all cases require the services of a pilot, and it would be possible to insist on payment of the consoli-in dated due before the pilotage service was rendered. We cannot report that in our opinion this would enable dues to be levied in eren/case, because it is conceiv able that a ship might refuse to employ a pilot in the service of the commission or give any other opportunity for obtaining the payment of the due in advance. If the ships were left alone, it is not likely that they would take this course because it would not be worth their while. It is possible, however, that some foreign Power might encourage a hostile attitude on the part of its shipping for the purpose of forcing the Turkish Government to admit it to representation on the commission to the same extent as Great Britain. We do not think that this risk is very serious, and we recommend that it should be faced. We think it is improbable that any Power would consider that sumcient political advantage was to be obtained from adopting this course It would certainly irritate the Porte, and it could not be carried out without iniuring the commerce of its subjects and its shipping. The long period during which Great Britain has provided and maintained buoys, etc., at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab and the many services which she has rendered to the cause of navigation in that district provide the Porte with a perfectly good answer to any claim to equal participation which other Powers may put forward, because Turkey can say, and say with truth, that owing to the multifarious services rendered by Great Britain, she (Turkey) had ceased to be master on her own river, and that the only way in which to secure the cessation of the exsitmg state of things and the transfer of these services to the commission was by appointing a British subject as a member of the commission. The only other policy would be for no dues to be levied at all, and for the entire expenses of the commission to be borne either bv the Porte alone or by the Porte and Great Britain jointly. Either proposal would, in our opinion, be opea to objection, nor would either be likely to meet with favour from the Ottoman Gov ernment. Although we are reluctant to recommend a departure from established British policy in respect of financial aid to works in foreign territory, we yet ven ture to think that, if it should appear that the imposition of dues is impracti cable, the importance of maintaining the Shatt-el-Arab and its approaches m good navigable condition is so great that, if the Porte could be induced to accept an arrangement under which the expenses of the commission would be borne by the two Powers jointly, the policy of an annual grant for this purpose from the British and Indian Exchequers merits the careful consideration of the Cabinet. On one point we think it is desirable that matters should be left open for an understanding with Germany. Under the original Baghdad Railway concession the railway company have the right to construct wharves, etc., at Basrah. It may eventually turn out to be better for the commission not to attempt to construct wharves at that port, so as to leave the field clear for the new railway company to be formed for the Baghdad-Gulf section. It would be an advantage to the [com mission financially, as it will have plenty of work elsewhere for all the funds at its disposal, and it might form the basis of an understanding under, which Germany would not oppose the work of the commission. ^ Dealing now with the changes made in the original draft, in the order of the several articles, we have the honour to submit the following observations Article i—The word 'remain' has been substituted for 'be' to em phasise the claim that the river is open already. Article 5.—The words ' and the surveyor ' have been added to meet the wish expressed by the Admiralty that a British naval officer should be associated with the commission. Article 6 (a). —The words ' and as the funds at its disposal will allow ' have been struck out, as it is feared that they might be made a pretext for the com mission to evade carrying out necessary works. Article 6 (^.—Difficulties may occur as to the control of pilotage by the commission, but in practice we do not think they should be insurmountable. C357FD 63Article 6 (e).—We consider it advisable to lay down precisely the lights and buoys which are handed over to the commission, and that a schedule shou e Article 6 (/).—We considered whether the insertion of the word Turkish before 4 ' banks '' would be expedient; but the convention can only apply to places under Turkish jurisdiction, and the limitation therefore seems unnecessary. We have used banks ^ in the plural because on the higher reaches of the river both banks are Turkish. _ • • i • i o Articles 8, 9, 10 are a re-arrangement and expansion of the original articles 8 and 9, the changes having been made especially with a view to strengthening the provisions against discrimination. Article 11. —We consider it inadvisable that the commission should have the option of borrowing from any Power other than Great Britain or Turkey, since foreign Powers might make the advance of capital a pretext for claiming represen tation on the commission. Article 15.—We do not consider it imperative to insist upon the umpire being nominated by the British Institute of Civil Engineers, and we suggest that we might, if advisable, concede this point in the course of negotiation. Article 15.—Understanding that the frontier between Turkey and Moham- merah is to be laid down in some other document, we have inserted a saving clause which will preclude the commission from exercising,any jurisdiction on the Persian bank, or in Persian waters, without the consent of Persia or the Shaikh of Mohammerah. f Article 19.— This is taken, with a few slight modifications, from the model commercial treaty. We have suggested twenty-one years as the period of the agreement, on the ground that it may be advantageous that the question ot its renewal should coincide with that of a possible renewal of the customs increase, which we understand His Majesty's Government intend to agree to only m the first instance for a period of seven years. We have omitted the original article 18, which was as follows : — &lt;f The Imperial Ottoman Government will offer no objection to the continu ance of the custom whereby the war-ships of His Britannic Majesty freely ascend the Shatt-el-Arab as far as Kurna,' on the ground that it may be awkward to raise discussion respecting a custom which has been acquiesced in, if not explicitly recognised, for a great many years, and which His Majesty's Government could in no case abandon. We feel that there is some risk that Turkey will claim that the present an chorage of Mohammerah, which is on the Shatt-el-Arab, is within the limits of Turkish sovereignty, though outside the Turkish frontier as locally observed. It would be desirable, therefore, that the agreement in which the Mohammerah frontier is laid down should specifically recognise that the Mohammerah anchorage is within the Persian sphere. We have not inserted a clause to the effect that the British member of the commission should represent the Shaikh of Mohammerah's interests, since it appears more suitable to provide for this in some covering document at the time when the draft Convention is transmitted to the Turkish representatives. We have, &amp;c. EDMOND J. W. SLADE. A. HIRTZEL. GEO. J STANLEY. A. G. DALLAS. C. J. B. HURST. PERCY ASHLEY. ALWYN PARKER.11 65 Enclosure in No. 1. Revised Draft Convention for the Establishment of a Shatt-el-Arab Navi gation Commission. T he Government of His Britannic Majesty and the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan of Turkey, being desirous on account of the magni tude of their interests in the trade on the Shatt-el-Arab to improve the naviga tion of that river, and to diminish tha risks to which, commerce thereon is exposed, have agreed as follows 1. The navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain open to the ships of all nations. 2. The Imperial Ottoman Government will establish a Commission in which shall be vested the control of the Shatt-el-Arab from Kurna to the sea. 3. The Commission shall consist of two members only, to be appointed by the Imperial Ottoman Government. One of these two members shall be of British nationality, and shall be selected from candidates suggested by the Government of His Britannic Majesty. 4. Each of the Commissioners shall receive annually a salary of £T, 2,000 free of all deductions. These salaries shall be paid by the Commission. 5. The Commission shall appoint such-officers and employes as may be neces sary, but the Chief Engineer and the Surveyor shall be of British nationality. The salaries of such officers and employes shall be fixed and paid by the Commission. 6. The Commission shall be charged with the following duties ia) The execution of such works as may be necessary for the improvement of the channel of the river and of the approaches thereto on the seaward side. (h) The maintenance of the channel of the river free from obstructions of all sorts, so as to keep it in the best possible state for navigation. (c) The preparation, issue, and enforcement of regulations for the navigation of the river and for the policing of the river and the land and buildings held by the Commission. {d) The control of pilotage. (e) The buoying and lighting of the channel, and the maintenance and control ot the lights and buoys in the approaches to the river specified in the Schedule to this Convention. (/) The supervision, so far as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of this convention, and subject to the treaty rights of foreign Powers, of the wharves, quays, docks, and jetties belonging to private persons in or on the banks of the river, 'and the provision of such additional accommodation and facilities as the Commission may deem necessary. 7. The Imperial Ottoman Government undertakes to facilitate the acquisition by the Commission of such land as the Commission shall consider necessary to enable it to carry out effectually the duties assigned to it. The cost of such land shall be paid by the Commission. In cases where land to which fishing rights are attached is required by the Commission, no unnecessary interference with such fishing rights shall take place. 8. No dues, taxes, or charges shall be levied either by the Porte or by the Commission on ships or goods on the Shatt-el-Arab based on the mere fact of navigation. 9 The Commission shall have the sole right to levy any dues or charges that mav be found necessary to cover the expenses of works undertaken and services maintained by it. In the event of such dues being found necessary they shall not exceed the amount reasonably required for the above purposes, including the administration of the Commission, and their produce shall be exclusively applied thereto, any surplus being devoted to the reduction of dues. In no case shall the rate of dues exceed 1 fr. per net registered ton of shipping.10. Any dues or charges levied by the Commission shall be levied impartially and equitably in respect of all vessels, whatever be the places from or to which they arrive or depart, or the nations or persons to which the vessels or their cargoes belong. Similarly there shall be no differentiation in the matter of facilities bet ween vessels or goods of different nations or persons, or between vessels arriving from or departing to different places. 11. Any sums which it may become necessary for the Commission to borrow for the purpose of carrying out the duties imposed upon it shall be advanced by the high contracting parties at a rate of interest not exceeding 5 per cent, per annum, in such proportions and upon such terms as to repayment as they may arrange. 12. The control of all funds raised and expended by the Commission shall be vested exclusively in the Commission. 13. The Commission shall publish annually complete and accurate accounts, showing the amounts received and expended by it. 14. If the receipts of the Commission are insufficient to cover its ordinary expenditure the deficit shall be made good by the Imperial Ottoman Government. 15. In the event of the members of the Commission being unable to agree as to whether any particular works are or are not necessary for the improvement of the Shatt-el-Arab, or as to the way in which particular works should be carried out, the question shall be referred by them to an engineer of repute, to be agreed upon by the commissioners, or, failing agreement, to be nominated by the presi dent of the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, and the decision of such engineer shall be adopted by the Commission. 16. The Commission shall correspond upon all matters connected with the duties entrusted to it with the Sublime Porte direct, and not through the local authorities. 17. The local authorities shall not interfere in any way with the houses, build ings, land, or other property of the Commission, or with its funds, or with the dis charge of their duties by the officers of the police, pilotage, or other services main tained by the Commission, or with wharves, jetties, docks, or quays in or on the banks of the river belonging to private persons. 18. The transfer to the Commission of any buoys or lights in the approaches to the Shatt-el-Arab shall not be deemed to affect the territorial jurisdiction in the waters where such buoys or lights are placed, or be made a ground on the part of the Imperial Ottoman Government for claiming that such waters are within its territorial jurisdiction, nor shall anything in this Convention be deemed to ffive the Commission power to exercise jurisdiction or to carry out duties or to hold land outside the limits of the Ottoman Empire without the consent of the territorial Power, or to affect the operation or the interpretation of the provisions of anv treaty or arrangement prescribing or defining the limits of the said Empire. 19. This agreement shall be binding during twenty-one years from the dav of its signature. In case neither of the contracting parties shall have given notice to the other, twelve months before the expiration of the said period of twentv- one years, of the intention to terminate the agreement, it shall remain in force until the expiration of one year from the day on which either of the contracting parties shall have denounced it. . ° ^ (Received on the 5th August 1912, with Political Secretary's letter No. 29 dated the 19th July 1912.) I ndia O ffice, W hitehall, P 2676 L ondon , S. W. , 12th July 1912. In reply to your letter No. 27623 of the 6th instant on the subject ofthe Bash- dad Railway negotiations I am directed by the Secretary of State for India toforward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copv of a telegram from the Government of India regarding the cahier des charges attached to the Baghdad Railway Convention. The Marquess of Crewe is advised that, inasmuch as it is no longer proposed by His Majesty's Government to participate in the Baghdad-Basrah section, if constructed, it is not necessary to insist on the amendments suggested by the Gov ernment of India. While, therefore, he is inclined to agree with the Government of India that the amendments are desirable in themselves, he will not press them if Sir E. Grey prefers not to take them up at this late stage. I am to add that he concurs in the draft articles for a convention in respect of railways in Asiatic Turkey prepared by the Board of Trade. With reference to the draft annex on the subject of cotton goods, I am to call attention to paragraph 5 of my letter P.-2613 of the 8th instant, and to say that Lord Crewe regards the proposed addition with grave misgiving, not only as tending to overcharge negotiations which he understands Sir E. Grey to think sufficiently charged already, but also as likely to bring other Powers into the field with claims for tariff concessions in favour of their own special interests. In this way the scope of the negotiations may, he fears, be dangerously enlarged, with serious risks to the prospects of securing the objects for which alone they were initiated. While therefore, he is unable to object to the inclusion of a proposal regarding cotton in the indeterminate form now suggested, he desires to state at once in unequivocal terms his view that it will be impossible to place it on the same level as the political conditions, or to sacrifice any of them to it. Those conditions have been advanced, and can, in his opinion, be fully justified on grounds of Imperial no less than of Indian interests. The broad answer to the criticism that the tangible commercial advantage secured is disproportionate to the cash price paid (so far as that criticism well-founded) is to be found in the very consideration which it is proposed to urge upon the Turkish Government, viz. that the agreement ' to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. ' The general result of the agreement (above and beyond particular commercial advantages) will be the secure estabhshment in the Persian Gulf of the political position of Gieat Britain under the shadow of which alone British commerce can flourish ; while the loss of that position cannot fail to react seriously upon the prestige and, pro tanto, the commercial interests, of this country not only in those regions but throughout the East. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Board of Trade. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, R. RITCHIE. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. {Received on the 5th August 1912, with Political Secretary's letter No. 29, dated ike 19th July 1912.) [A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [July 18.] ; CONFIDENTIAL. ~ S ection 1. [28322] - ~ Ko&gt; j Sir Edward Grey to Tew file Pasha. (Confidential.) Foreign Office. July 18, 1912. Y our H ighness, I H ve the honour to transmit to your Highness herewith a memorandum embodying the reply of His Maiesty's^Government^to the memorandum cota- 67 C357FD68 municated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last., relating to questions connected with the Baghdad Eailway and the Persian Gulf. In communicating this document to your Highness, I desire to call your atten tion to two additional points which are not dealt with in the memorandum or i s annexes. In the first place His Majesty's Government consider it highly desirable in order to secure the smooth working of the arrangements proposed m regard to the Baghdad Eailway, that at least one British director, approved by His Majes ty's Government, should be admitted to the board of the Baghdad Railway Company. Such an arrangement would of course require the consent of the German Government. Secondly, as the Turkish Government are aware, certain rights are secured to Persia under the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), and the geographical position of Mohammerah is such that the Shaikh cannot fail to be brought into contact with the Riverain Commission ; and, unless provision is made for these facts there is a risk of the friction arising which it is the object of the two Governments to avoid. There would have been much to be said for an International Riveram Commission on which Persia, equally with Great Britain and Turkey should be represented. But as His Majesty's Government, appreciating the objections entertained by the Porte, have not pressed for this, it is necessary to provide m some other way for the representation of Persia in such matters as may touch her rights, whether under the Treaty of Erzeroum or under this new agreement. His Majesty s Government therefore propose that the commissioner, who is a British subject, should be charged with the duty of making to the commission such representations as may at any time be necessary upon any question affecting those nghts, and they will be willing to use their good offices with the Persian Government and the bhaikh of Mohammerah to induce them to agree to this arrangement. These two points come, perhaps, outside the scope of the matters dealt with in the memorandum, which are confined to subjects of negotiation beween Great Britain and Turkey alone, but His Majesty's Government attach great importance to them and trust that they will receive the favourable consideration of the Imperial Ottoman Government. I have, etc., E. GREY. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum communicated to Turkish Ambassador. 1. His Majesty's Government have not failed to examine with much care and attention the important proposals which are emboided in the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last. 2. Throughout their deliberations, His Majesty's Government have been animated by the conviction that a complete agreement on outstanding questions is eminently to be desired in the larger interests of both countries. They are persuaded that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty's Government therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals and considerations. 3. For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may be dealt with under three distinct headings (i) The Baghdad Railway question. (ii) ( The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (m) An increase in the Turkish customs duties.69 j_j {{). The Baghdad Railway Question. 4. The interest which Great Britain must t-ake in a railway, which is to traverse a region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total exports and imports, is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty's Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner in which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-half centuries ago, of tha first English factory at Basrah ; they have recalled that no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Basrah was British; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Baghdad Railway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties. 5. The magnitude of Great Britain's manifold interests clearly renders it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the sou thern section of the Baghdad Railway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty's Government find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. ' In these circumstances His Majesty's Government, anxious to prove to the Otto man Government the sincerity of their desire to reachga comprehensive under standing without delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation in the railway from Baghdad to Basrah, if a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the other points enumerated in this memorandum. 6. It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty's Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. His Majesty's Govern ment consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the following conditions as essential to that end :— (а) An arrangement, as set forth in the accompanying draft convention, Draft Con- for the exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in vention Asiatic Turkey. 1 (Annex 2 ). (б) The admission of two British representatives, approved by His Majesty's Government, to the board of whatever company may undertake the construction or working of the railway from Baghdad to Basrah. (c) The terminus of the railway to be at Basrah. {d) No railway to be continued beyond Basrah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty's Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. (e) A convention to be signed, on the basis of the accompanying draft, Draft Con- for the future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. This convention v ®' tlon must be read in conjunction with the accompanying memorandum nnex (Annex No. 5) on the subject of the frontier of Mohammerah. (/) Permission to be given for three British steamers to navigate between Baghdad and Basrah in addition to the number already allowed. (it). The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. 7. His Majesty's Government note with satisfaction that the Turkish Govern ment renounce their claims to Bahrain on conditions which there should be no difficulty in accepting, but they have learnt with disappointment the attitude of the Imperial Ottoman Government in regard to El Katr and Kuwait; nevertheless they do not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the important sacrifice made by His Majesty's Government in the matter of British participa tion in the Baghdad Railway, and that they will meet that sacrifice by a corres ponding modifiction of the views set forth in the Turkish memorandum of the 15th April. ♦V 70 8. His Majesty's Government must, in the first instance, protest against the con tention that there is a misunderstanding with regard to the assurance given, and repeatedly given, to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrain, Maskat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. 9. The original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office, and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy. 10. His Majesty's Government maintain that prior to Midhat Pasha's expedi tion there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish Annex 4. jurisdiction or occupation, effective or ineffective. And while they are now pre- apared to recognise Turkish sovereignty between the southernmost limits of Ku wait (as hereinafter defined) and Ojeir, they are unable to admit that any of the ar guments adduced in the Turkish memorandum in any way invalidates the statement that south of Ojeir, in the district of El Katif, there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; and they are fully persuaded that El Katr has never been locally regarded as forming part of, or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire. For themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the Turkish assu rances mentioned above, they have never so regarded it, and they have repeatedly informed the Sublime Porte accordingly. 11. His Majesty's Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula of El Katr, including El Bidaa. They have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority,which first attempted to assert itself so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition. t { 12. The Turkish memorandum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty's Government all the information which they consider essential to a due apprecia tion of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Kuwait. His Majesty's Government are concerned to ensure the continuance of the local government of the Shaikh of Kuwait, as defined in their memorandum of the 29th July 1911. Further, His Majesty's Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Kuwait and indeed to recognise the Shaikh as a Turkish kaima- kam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Kuwait, to the withdrawal of the Turkish military post from Bubiyan, and to a recognition of the limits of Kuwait in accordance with the indications contained in the acompanying memo randum, 13. His Majesty's Government regret that they would consider the introduction of divided responsibility for maritime police measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their policy in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century, To modify the system in these circumstances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed His Majesty's Government would go further. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf; they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative; and it was this attitude which led to the declaration made by the Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords, on the 5th May 1903, that 'His Majesty's Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, er of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at thek disposal.' Memo randum (Annex 4).His Majesty's Government must therefore ask tlie Turkish Government to recognise in the Persian Gulf the right of Great Britain—(a) to control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (6) to police its waters; and (c) to conduct all quarantine arrangements. 15. In submitting these final proposals for the acceptance of the Turkish Gov ernment, His Majesty's Government are not seeking territorial aggrandisement, nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simply to secure the recognition and to ensure the continuance of an order of things which, in fact, grew up undei their auspices and before the appearance of Turkish authority in the Persian Gulf, and which has been proved by experience to favour the development of trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which, but for long-sustained British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and bloodshed. 16. They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government will not oppose the continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years, and they look forward confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the improved relations which cannot fail to ensue. 17. As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a question which has caus ed some concern to His Majesty's Government in recent months, that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah. When His Majesty's Government addressed their memorandum of July 1911 to the Ottoman Government that question had been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty's Government had no desire to raise it. Now, however, that it has been raised, by circumstances beyond their control, they feel that no settlement in the Persian Gulf could be com plete which did not provide for this question, and they regard a satisfactory ad- Memo _ justment of it as an essential part of the present negotiations. They have the randum honour to submit a separate memorandum on the subject for the consideration (Annex 5). of the Ottoman Government. (iii). An increase in the Turkish customs duties. 18. Tf the Ottoman Government are prepared to conclude an agreement in the sense of this memorandum, and to concur in the removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt, then, subject to the assent of the other Powers, His Maj esty's Government will consent to the maintenance for a period of seven years, counting from six months after the date of such agreement, of the increase in the general rate of customs duty leviable on British goods on importation into the Ottoman Empire from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, ad valorem which was agreed to in 1907, and also to the further increase of this general rate of customs duty from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem for the same period. Foreign Office, July 18,1912. ANNEX 1. His Majesty's Government wish to mention a question to which they attach great importance but to which they have not referred in this memorandum. His Majesty's Government desira to secure that the duties leviable upon certain classes of cotton yarns and manufactures shall in no case exceed certain rates to be agreed upon. His Majesty's Government will furnish the Ottoman Government, with the least possible delay, with a schedule specifying these classes of goods and the duties to be applied to them. Foreign Office.

ANNEX 4. Kuwait. His Majesty's Government consider the frontier on the north to be a line running from Khor-as-Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwan to Jabal Sanam and thence to the Batin. On the south his boundary is considered to run eastwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to the Na'airiyah hill at the north-western corner of Eadaif. On the west the Shaikhdom isbounded between Jabal Sanam and Hafar by the Batin, and south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Summan from Dahanah as far south as the point where that line is intersected by the route from Wabrah to Riyadh. Districts and Islands.—The Shaikhdom, considered from the physical point of view, falls naturally into two parts, one to the north and the other to the south of a line joining Kuwait town and Riqa'i. In the northern block lie the districts or tracts of Batin, Shiqqaq, Batih, Umm -al-Khilan, Yah, Qirah-al-Marru, Zaqlah, and Zor. The southern block comprises the three great divisions of Summan, Dibdibah, and Umm Janaib, and the last, which lies along the coast to the south of Kuwait Bay, is further subdivided into districts named Shaqq, Qra'ab Adan, Salu, Hazaim, and Sudah. The maritime possessions of Kuwait consist of the islands of Bubiyan, Warba, and Failakhah, which, with its northern and southern outliers of Mashjan and 'Auhah, is situated at the mouth of Kuwait Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar* Qaru and Umm-al-Maradim. A map is enclosed showing the limits of Kuwait, j ANNEX 5. Mohammerah Frontier, His Majesty's Government have already informed the Imperial Ottoman Government of the great importance which they attach to the maintenance of the frontier status quo, as locally observed, in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. His Majesty's Government now have the honour to explain their views in greater detail, and they would preface their statement by observing that they have not only re-examined all the evidence, both oral, and documentary, which was laid before the conference of Erzeroum, but they have also had recourse to the great store of information collected by the well-known savant Major (after wards Sir Henry) Rawlinson, who was well-acquainted with the country, and made a profund study of the territorial position in the Mohammerah region, based upon historical facts and the deeds of titles relating to each particular plot of land. Moreover, much information, which was not at the disposal of the Commissioners at Erzeroum, has been traced in the voluminous records of the East India Company, who carried on direct trade with Basrah from the year 1635. These records are especially illuminating in regard to the conditions which actually p jevailed on the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab during the 17th and 18th centuries. The accompanying maps indicate the line of the frontier as it has been locally observed for a century or more. For facility of reference, the line may be follow ed, firstlv, from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where it strikes the Shatt-el-Arab and, secondly, along the course of that river until it reaches the sea. By ref erence to the accompanying map No. 1, the village of Shu'aib will be observed at a point 15f miles on a bearing of 8 degrees north of west from Hawizeh : it is a settled village of the Beni Salih, containing some 500 inhabitants living in permanent dwellings. The whole country, comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu'aib, and Kuskh-i-Basri, is regularly occu pied and cultivated by the tribes of Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, who are not nomadic, in the ordinary sense of the term, but are settled inhabitants. These tribes, who exclusively inhabit, and where possible cultivate, the triangular tract above referred to, have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh, which has been a recognised district of the Persian province of Khuzis- tan or Arabistan, for, at any rate, four centuries. They pay revenue to their tribal shaikhs, who formerly passed it on in tribute to the Maula ruler of Hawizeh, who in turn paid it to the Persian Government, but, since 1902, this tribute has been collected through the agency of the Shaikh of Mohammerah. c357fd 7576 To tlie eastward of the marsh on which the village of Shu-aib is situated, and southwards, as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction, nor of Turkish status. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf has recently visited the Hawizeh district, and his investigations have served to confirm the information which His Majesty's Glovernment already possessed. Apart from the shaikhs and tribesmen of the Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, Sir Percy Cox came in contact with many old inhabitants who could speak with long experience in regard to the territorial status quo. The view universally expressed as to the frontier was as follows- 1. That whatever is the western boundary of the Hawizeh is, if so facte, the frontier of Persia: in other words, that the Hawizeh district is included within the confines of Persia. 2. That the f f Hawizeh district'' comprises those lands, which are regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes belonging to it, and paying revenue to Persia. 3. That, on the above premises, the boundary locally recognised is that shown by a green line on map No. I. It will be noticed that the line (which is formed by the edge of the marsh, and is thus a natural frontier), after crossing the Ghor-el-Azem, eventually cuts the main channel of the marsh just west of Shu'aib, continues in a southerly direction until it reaches a point due west of Kuskh-i-Basri, whence it breaks back to that place, and then proceeds direct to the Shatt-el-Arab at Di'aiji. The reason why Kuskh-i-Basri is recognised as an angle of the boundary is referable to the existence of a winter lake of rain water at Yafair ; the limit of cultivation and occupation by tribesmen under Hawizeh in this direction is regulated by the distance from their water supply (Yafair), at which they can safely dwell and keep their flocks, and this limit is considered to be reached at Kuskh-i-Basri, where the ruins of an extensive building of great age form a convenient landmark. His Majesty's Government, being in possession of precise and trustworthy information regarding the frontier of Hawizeh, have no occasion to appeal to more uncertain authorities, but they think ft is not without interest to recall to the Imperial Ottoman Government that Dervish Pasha, whose estimates of Turkish claims were not usually marked by excessive moderation, admits in Chapter XIII of his book, (printed in Constantinople in 1868), that it would be harldy rightfor the Ottoman Government to lay claim to the country of Hawizeh, though, in the subsequent chapter. His Excellency expresses the view that it ' c might be useful ' for Turkey to claim it as a pretext for proposing something else, viz., that the Kerkha should be adopted as the boundary above Sheria. Coming now to the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab, the frontier as locally observed enters the Khaiyin Canal (which is the name of the channel running from the Turkish Customs Post at Di'aiji, between the islands of Kharnubiyah, Bowarin, and Aqawat, to the junction of the Nahr Nazaileh with the main stream) at a point between the Nahr Di'aiji and the Nahr Abul Arabid ; it follows the middle of' the Nahr Khaiyin until it reaches the point where the Nahr Khaiyin and the Nahr Nazaileh meet the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab. (See map No. 2.) It then proceeds, as shown by the broken black line (see accompanying maps Nos. 3 and 4), along the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, in mid-stream, until that river reaches the Persian Gulf. The claim made by Persia rests on continuad and undisturbed possession for over a century, and on the recognition of Persian sovereignty by local representa tives of the Turkish Government in many ways and on many different occasions. Thus there is unanimity of evidence amongst the local tribesmen that the boundary as locally observed has not been questioned by the Turkish authorities, who, on the contrary, many years ago had actually buried some coal in a pit as a perma nent boundary mark ; and it further appears that the periodical cleaning of the Nahr Khaiyin has always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, whilst the cleaning of the Di'aiji Canal has been carried out exclusively under the orders of the Turkish mudirs.77 The local inhabitants moreover draw a very clear line of distinction between tlie position of the Shaikh of Mohammerah in, for instance, the islands of Akawat, Barin or Bowarin, Shamshamiyah, and Umm-ut-Tnwaileh, of the greater part of which he is merely proprietor, and his position on the Persian side of the locally recognised boundary. From the point where the locally observed frontier leaves the Khaiyin Canal and, opposite the Nahr Nazaileh, enters the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, it follows thzmedivm filum aqncB of the Shatt-el-Arab down to the Persian Gulf. (See maps Nos. 3 and 4.) This line of demarcation is in accordance with the general presumption that, where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous States, the middle of the channel or ' thalweg ' is the actual line of separation between those two States. Such a presumption may, however, be swept away, either by proof of prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession on the of part of one of the two States, •or by express treaty stipulation. The records of the past 300 years, as contained in the official archives of the East India Company and of His Majesty's Government, are far from supporting any claim on the part of Turkey to ' prior occupancy and long undisturbed posses sion of the Shatt-el-Arab ; while no express stipulation is contained in the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) as to the ownership of the river. If, therefore. His Majesty's Government had strict regards either to purely local considerations or to the letter of the treaties, they would not hesitate to press for the frontier as locally recognised along its whole length from Hawizeh to the Persian Gulf. But they prefer to look at the negotiations in which they are now engaged as a whole, and are sincerely anxious to arrive at an arrangement which both parties can accept ex animo, and which, by removing all points of grievance and friction not only between themselves, but also between the Sublime Poite and the Shaikh of Mohammerah, will place the relations of all concerned on a thoroughly satisfactory footing. Provided, therefore, the Turkish Government will accept the frontier status quo as already indicated from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where the Khaiyin Canal and the Nahr Nazaileh enter the Shatt-el-Arab, then His Majesty's Government are prepared to use their influence with the Persian Gov ernment and the Shaikh of Mohammerah to induce them to recognise Turkish sove reignty over the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, subject to the following con ditions :— (i) The following islands to be recognised as within the territorial limits of Per.sia :— (a) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh, the four islands situated between Shatait and Ma'awiyeh, and the two islands off Manquhi. These islands are in fact parts of the island of Abadan, and must be so regarded. (b) Any islands now in existence, or which may hereafter be formed, and which may be connected at low water either, with Abadan Island or with the Persian bank below the Nahr Nazaileh. (ii) The arrangements proposed by His Majesty's Government for maintain ing full freedom of navigation on the river, and for its conservancy, to be accepted by the Ottoman Government. (iii) The modern port and anchorage of Mohammerah, ^ which is in the main stream of the Shatt-el-Arab above and below its junction with the Karun, to be recognised as within Persian jurisdiction. (See Map No. 2.) (iv) No interference to take place with existing fishing rights and usages on or from the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, that phrase being understood to comprise all land on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab or on the Persian islands therein which is uncovered at normal low tide. (v) Turkish jurisdiction not to extend to land on the Persian bank, defined as above, which is only temporarily covered with water in time of flood or from any accidental cause, and Persian jurisdiction not to extend to land which is temporarily or acidentally uncovered below normal low-water mark.(vi) The Shaikh of Mohammerah to continue in full enjoyment of his existing proprietary rights in lands situated in Turkish territory.D x&gt; Confidential. ^oreisn ©ffice, Sim/a, the ^ ^August f: ■ - 12.SEP.iSl t -y r Please refer to correspondence ending with our endorsement i ;0 .9l4-ji.A..confidential, dated the 3rd May 1912, regarding the Turkish post on Bubiyan Island.

What I have been able to learn confirms the information contained in Mr. Monck-Mason's despatch No. 2 of the 24th ultimo. As your Excellency is aware, trains now run from Haidar Pasha to Ulu Kish- la, via Eskishehr, Konia, and Eregli. After leaving Ulu Kishla, the line follows the course of the Tarbaz Chai. which at Bozanti is known as the Bozanti River. A tunnel has been made at Chifteh Han, and the line from Ulu Kishla has been laid for a little way beyond that point, i.e-, rather more than half the distance be tween Ulu Kishla and Bozanti. At Ak Kieupru there is a constructon camp ; further on at Bozanti levelling operations are in progress, and a large railway station is being built. A German engineer with whom I had a conversation at Bozanti informed me that it would require three years to construct the tunnel which would enable the line to be laid connecting Bozanti with Dorak. I am informed that the goods traffic on the recently opened section, Dorak' Mamou'reh, is very small, transport by road being found cheaper. I have , etc., W. D. W. MATTHEWS.

Baghdad, June 14,1912. D ear M r . G reenway, I thought it might interest you to hear the result of a confidential talk I have been enabled to have with his Excellency Meissner Pasha, director-in-chief of the Baghdad Railway. In return for certain information I was able to afford him regarding the country of Irak and prospects, he was good enough to tell me that as the main section of the line is being delayed, partly over some question concerning the kilometric guarantee and partly over that of the Baghdad-Basrah section, he was anxious to construct such branches as, not being included under the kilometric guarantee, are not liable to the causes of delay suffered on the parts thereto subject. He looks first to the Khanikin line as being easy, offering a quick return, and one which will keep his highly-paid'staff employed in the interval. He informed me that the line would probably pass north of'Bakuba, Shahraban, and Kizil Rubat crossing the Diala river between the last place and Khanikin, and that if he finally decides to go ahead he would not take more than eight months to get trains running as the route is very simple. He will be visiting Khanikin with the chief of customs in a few days (to decide upon a site for the station and customs house) and asked me to meet him there, and also for permission to come to Chia Surkh. I gave him an invitation to do so, as there is nothing there with which he is not familiar, and he is a. man whose great influence in the affairs of the Baghdad and Mosul vilayets renders his friendship verv desirable. He knows very well that the oil found on the Turkish side (at Mandali, Gil, Khurmati, Dwazda Imam, and Kirkuk), quite apart from the fact that it is so impregnated with sulphur as to be refined only under great expense and difficulties, is not exploited, and has very little chance of being exploited for a long time to come. (All these places are far beyond the zone of 20 kilom. besides the line which they may exploit themselves). In that case, if we have sufficient oil, we might be able to sell fuel oil to the Khanikin branch, the better prospect of such being afforded by the fact that Meissner Pasha, being notably engineer first and politician after, looks only to 8586 the satisfactory consummation of his technical aims, and utilises what suits him in its attainment, regardless of the questions of nationality, which present obstacles where other foreigners are concerned. The characteristic is witnessed by his attitude towards and assistance to another British concern here, solely because they can further the progress of this work. Yours sincerely, E. B. SOANE.

S ir, With reference to my despatch No. 573 of the 5th instant, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty's Consul at Aleppo reporting on the progress of the Baghdad Railway. I have, etc., CHARLES M. MARLING. E nclosure. Consul Fontana to Sir Gerard Lowfher. (No. 43.) July S ir, I have the honour to submit the following short report on the progress made in the construction of the Baghdad Railway line in this district. The station at Aleppo is now nearing completion. Strong iron sleepers imported from Germany, are being used throughout the permanent way The rails have been laid from Aleppo to Muslemieh, the junction, and thence north eastwards as far as the Sajur. A temporary wooden bridge is being built over the Sajur. Work has begun upon a temporary wooden bridge to span the Euphrates near Jerablus, which should be completed by the end of October next. Fears are expressed as to the stability of this temporary bridge in flood time. It is said that the line from the Sajur to the Euphrates will be finished by the end of Septem ber. I understand that the various pieces required to construct. the Euphrates permanent Steel bridge have not yet been purchased owing to the high prices now ruling m Germany. Difficulties are, moreover, foreseen as to the construction of an embankment near Jerablus village. The station at Muslemieh is nearly completed. The Rations between there and Jerablus will be Akterin, Chorban Bey, Sajur, and Helman. ' OFrom Muslemieh westwards the line has been laid up to some little way be yond Catma, a distance of over 40 kilm. in all. The expulsion of over 500 Italian engineers and workmen seems to have seriously affected the construction of the line. Some Greek engineers and mechanics were afterwards brought over to carry on the work, which has been rapidly pushed forward. Most of the manual labour, however, since the expulsion of the Italians, appears to have been performed by native gangs of labourers, and the rails in various places between Muslemieh and the Sajur have been unevenly laid, viz., one rail higher or lower than the others This may prove a serious drawback to heavy trains travelling at any speed. I understand that no money has been paid for the expropriation of the lands in the Sajur-Jerablus region, saving, perhaps, certain of those which are actually under cultivation. Much dissatisfaction has been caused at Aleppo by the low prices paid by the company, backed by the Government, for the expropriation of private property, and at Alexandretta it is said that much real injustice has been done to landowners in this way. The company began, and have carried on, the work regardless, apparently, of expense, and huge sums have been expended in connection with the work. An enormous quantity of costly material has been imported, a large staff of highly- paid German engineers, craftsmen, officials, and native clerks are employed, and the wages paid to the labourers on the line have been quite abnormal. The com pany, nevertheless, have acquired an unenviable reputation through all this dis trict. Various contractors for the construction of sections of the line have aban doned their contracts with great pecuniary loss. A French contractor, who had invested his whole capital in the work, died recently at Aleppo, leaving a widow nearly penniless with a claim of over 2,000/. against Ihe company. Another French subject, an engineer, who threw up work in the Far East to obtain employ ment on the Baghdad Railway, spent his entire capital of 1,000/. in attempting to fulfil a contract with the company, but owing to a rise in labourers' wages, and to other causes, he did not succeed, and is now prosecuting the company in the Ottoman law court for the recovery of the 1,000/. The company have hitherto refused to modify any contract entered into, whatever might be the circumstances tending to render its fulfilment difficult or impossible. Contractors have, on more than one occasion, tried to make their losses good by paying their native labourers less than the daily wage agreed upon, thus provoking tumult and outcry. Some time ago three Kurdish labourers were wounded at Aleppo by Circassian guards in the company's employ, and two others were injured at Jerablus by guards in a scuffle arising from the Kurds attempting to mob the paymaster, who paid them less than their stipulated wage. The native workmen in the company's employ at Jerablus show themselves eager to find employment with the English men now carrying on excavations on the Jerablus mound, who employ several hundred men, and are greatly respected by the natives for their fair dealing and tact. The Germans, unfortunately, have incurred the distrust and dislike of the natives, whom they treat with no very rigid justice and with scant considera tion. Many of the Italian workmen and mechanics, on the eve of their departure from Aleppo, openly expressed their relief at being compelled to sever connection with the Baghdad Railway Company. The inauguration of the construction of the port at Alexandretta took place on the 10th ultimo, the local authorities, civil and military, being present at the ceremony. I have, etc., R. A. FONTANA.

S ir, In an interview wluch Sir Arthur Nicolson and I had with the Turkish Ambas sador to-day, we handed to him our reply about the Baghdad Railway and Persian Gulf negotiations and the annexed memoranda,* with certain maps. We specially drew Tewfik Pasha's attentioii to the memorandum asking for specific rates on cotton goods when the Turkish customs dues were increased. We said that we attached great importance to this. We had not put it into the reply about the Baghdad Railway and Persian Gulf because it introduced entirely new matter which was not germane to this subject, but as, in our reply, we proposed to abandon all parti cipation in the Baghdad.Railway from Baghdad to Basrah, we felt it essential to have something which would be a security for British trade, To give what we asked about cottpn goods would not entail any sacrifice upon the Turkish Government, it would not diminish their revenue, and it would be no burden to them, though it would give security to an important branch of British trade that the duties on it would be adjusted so as not to press unfairly on particular articles. The Turkish Ambassador seemed quite satisfied with what we told him, and made no objection. With, regard to participation in the Baghdad railway, he gaid that if we did not participate, as his country was free to give the concession for making the railway to anyone it liked, a British company might be employed. We said that this would be very satisfactory to us, but we had, of course, not thought it fair to stipulate for it as a condition. I am, etc., E. GREY.

In an annex to the memorandum handed to the Turkish Ambassador on the 18th July, it was indicated that a further memorandum would shortly be presented embodying the views of His Majesty's Government with regard to the customs treat ment of certain classes of cottons yarns and manufactures on importation into a matter to which they attach great importance in connection with any arrange ment between the two Governments for the increase of the present rate of the Turkish customs duties. His Majesty's Government understand that the Turkish Government propose a general increase from 11 to 15 per cent, ad valorem, and that this is desired not as a measure of protection for native industry, but solely as a means of increasing the Turkish revenue. His Majesty's Government, therefore, think it right to point out that the great bulk of the present trade between the two countries in cotton yarns and piece-goods is a trade in articles of a cheap description suited to the needs of a large body of consumers of limited means, and that, after careful enquiry, they are advised that an increase of duty from 11 to 15 per cent, on these articles would certainly cause either a diminution in the volume of the trade on account of the increase of price or a deterioration in the quality of the goods in order to retain the market, and that most probably it would have both these effects in varying degrees according to the class of goods. This being to, the Ottoman Government will realise that the proposed increase of duty must fail to yield a corresponding increase of revenue, since it will be levied on a smaller volume of goods of lower average value. In these circumstances. His Majesty's Government suggest that the interests both of the Turkish revenue, of the consuming population in Turkey, and of British manufacturers would be best met by limiting the increase of duty on cotton yarns and piece-goods to 2 per cent., viz., from 11 to 13 per cent, ad valorem. In making this proposal, His Majesty's Government think it desirable to call attention to the fact that British trade with Turkey is considerably greater than that of any other country, with the result that the burden inflicted by the proposed increase of Tur kish duties will fall much more heavily on British manufacturers and traders than on those of any other nationality. His Majesty's Government do not of course suggest that any special treatment should be accorded to British goods, which is not at the same time extended to similar goods of all nationalities, but they urge that the facts to which they have called attention^ justify the most favourable treatment by Turkey of the classes of goods in which British trade is predominant ly interested, especially'since there is ground for believing that the interests of British trade are in this matter in accordance with those of the Turkish Govern ment and people.

His Majesty's Government suggest that the interests both of the Turkish revenue, of the consuming population in Turkey, and of British manufacturers would be best met by limiting the increase of duty on cotton yarns and piece-goods to 2 per cent., viz., from 11 to 13 per cent, ad valorem. In making this proposal His Majesty's Government think it desirable to call attention to the fact that British trade with Turkey is considerably greater than that of any other country, with the result that the burden inflicted by the proposed increase of Turkish duties will fall much more heavily on British manufacturers and traders than on those of any other nationality. His Majesty's Government do not of course suggest that any special treatment should be accorded to British goods, which is not at the same time extended to similar goods of all nationalities, but they urge that the facts to which they have called attention justify-/ the most favorable treatment by Turkey of the classes of goods in which British trade is pre- x dominantly interested, especially since there is ground for believing that the in terests of British trade are in this matter in accordance with those of the Turkish Government and people.

Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Beceived August 26.) (No. 309.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petershurgh, August 26, 1912. MINISTER for Foreign Affairs read to me to-day a telegram which he had received from Russian charge d'affaires in London on the subject of agreement which Lynch has concluded with German bank. He was, he said, disagreeably surprised to hear that His Majesty's Government had raised no objections and had treated it as a matter that was of no political importance. After the Potsdam conversations he had been taken severely to task for having agreed not to obstruct construction of Bagdad Railway. He had done so because it was not in the power of Russian Government to prevent line being built. Agreement now signed went much farther, as it directly facilitated the construction of the railway by placing the Lynch steamers at the disposal of the company for the transport of railway material. Result would be to accelerate construction of the line, and thus would place Russian Government in a very embarrassing situation. According to Russo-German agreement, they were bound to commence Khanikin-Tehran line within two years from the completion of line from Sadijeh or eventually to allow Germans to construct,it. When they signed this agreement they believed that railway would not reach Bagdad for five or six years, but now this period might be considerably shortened. This was a very important side to the question, which, he regretted to say, had escaped the attention of His Majesty's Government. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (No. 760.) (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, August 27, 1912. YOUR telegram No. 309 of 26th August: Bagdad Railway. Under article 9 of their concession the Bagdad Railway Company are entitled to carry building materials for railway in their own vessels should they deem that course desirable ; the fact that Messrs. Lynch, as members of the transport syndicate, are to assist in the purchase and provision of vessels does not mean that the railway will be completed more expeditiously than if Messrs. Lynch had stood aside If Messrs. Lynch had not participated the Bagdad Railway Company would merely have bought vessels of their own, as they had the right to do under their concession. It would have been quite impossible for His Majesty's Government to have prevented a strictly commercial transaction of this kind. Indeed, it was so entirely a private commercial transaction and matter of routine that it was not referred to me personally till Russian charge d'affaires spoke of it the other day. In the absence of any agreement with Germany or Turkey we are as little desirous as anybody to facilitate construction of Bagdad Railway, but this transaction was outside of our control and has no real effect on date at which railway will be completed.

ON the receipt of your despatch No. 271 of the 24th June, I requested the commercial attache to this Embassy to endeavour to obtain a copy of the exact trace of the new section of the Bagdad Railway between Eregli and the Euphrates River. Mr. Weakley now states that, though his efforts in this direction have not yet been successful, he has reason to believe that he will be able to obtain the document in course of time. Meanwhile, he informs me confidentially that, he has had an opportunity of consulting the engineer-in-chief of the Bagdad Railway, who surveyed the line between Eregli and Aleppo, and is at present in charge of the work of construction of the railway through the Taurus, as to the accuracy of the trace shown in the new sections of the Kiepert map of Asia Minor, viz.:— Section C 4, Kaiserije. „ D 4, Adana. „ D 5, Haleb. The engineer, who is particularly anxious that it should not be known that he gives this Embassy any information, examined these maps very carefully and informed Mr. Weakley confidentially that the trace was quite accurately shown on tl.em, and that it was evident that the maps had been compiled from surveys and data supplied to Kiepert by the Deutsche Bank. Mr. Weakley adds that the three tunnels now being pierced in the gorge of the Tchakit River are the ;— 1. Belamadik Tunnel of 1,800 metres in length. 2. Tashdeunmez Tunnel of 100 metres in length. 3. Hadj Kiri Tunnel of 2,100 metres in length. The line will be carried through the Amanus Range by a tunnel 5,500 metres in length at Bagtcheh. r hivp CHARLES M. MARLING.

As regards the river frontage, a small portion of it has been re served by the local authorities to their own use, but the company are to have the use of the remainder. I have received your despatch No. 691 of the 14th instant reporting the completion of the purchase of land, including river frontage, by the Baghdad Rail way Company at Basrah or Maghil.

It must not be assumed that the fact of Messrs.

The Baghdad Railway Company are entitled, under article 9 of their concession, to carry building materials for the railway in their own vessels should such a course appear desirable to them. They have the right under their concession to buy vessels of their own, and they would have done this if Messrs. Lynch had not participated.
