Sir, I am directed to refer to le tter No .F.146-1.a./35 ^ endorsement g dated the 11th December 1935, from the Government of India in the late Foreign and Political Department. ^ 2. It has been represented that the continued exclusion of Indian States from India’s acceptance of Articles n(o), 5, 6 crnd 7 of the Slavery Convention of 1926, of which copies are enclosed, has given rise at Geneva to the suspicion that, apart from tne admitted..to Assam only. admitted survival in certain oarts of britisA o: various systems of debt-bondage, [Tt/jeT aouses emst 1*1 one States and are bein- deliberately concealed. Io is under stood that tne Lee£ue T s Aavisory Committee of Experts on Slavery, because oi tnis suspicion, one no / ^ocubSiiiA oxasIx attention on conditions in Indian States the withdrawal of a similar reservation , ctiiu Gxicot, s ince in respect oi certain unadministered tracts in Britisxi India, it i'a^S become increasingly difficult for the representatives of India at the League to justify the maintenance oi tne existing reservation in respect of tne States, 3. Previous enquiries nave already elicited tne fact that neither slavery nor conditions analogous to slavery existed in any Indian State, and that tne position in regard to compulsory labour did not compare unfavourably with the position in British India, His Excellency the Crown Representative feels therefore tnat he is now justified in presuming tnat conditions no longei exist in the Indian States which would preclude him from accepting on tneir behalf the fuller obligations Ox tne Convention, as has been done for the resc Cx Indict, He accordingly proposes to withdraw the existing- reservation at tiie earliest opportunity, since he feels sure tnat Rulers must strongly resent the suspicions to which tins reservation has given rise and which he is confident are unreasonable in tne light of present conuitions. 4. As the action contemplated affects txie internal rC admini strati on of States, I am to request you (• if tne overnor has no objection,) kindly to ohdress the Man i pur Par bar — , His E xalted Highness the N izam’s Government th e Mysore Gove r nment. - t he States irPEHe Central India xigency JtEe Sfer t aT 'm te./fesl er n Ijid i.a fee States m the Puiiiab States Agenc y the.. .•the Bar ode, Government and the States in the Guj arat S tates nnency the Ka shm ir Go vernm ent 1 ~ t he G walior, hc in./ur a iid B enar es Darba rs t he S tates in tiie Mad ras St a tes .r:en cv ’ ^ tne Kolhapur Dafbar and the States in trie Deccan Sta te s .. .nexic y the States in the Eastern States .^ency and to ascertain wnetner tiiey have any comments to make.

Position of the Indian States In relation to the slavery Convention. Will you please refer to the correspondence ending with miabold’s demi-official letter No.P.Y.1123/ 1935, dated the 5th July 1935? I enclose a copy of a letter (N0.P.146-IA/35, 2 . dated the December 1935) which Is being addressed to all Political Officers concerned. Prom this it will be seen that steps are being taken to Induce all States that have not already taken action In this behalf to enact legislation in regard to slavery and forced labour on the lines of the legislation now prevailing In British India. Political Officers are moreover being enjoined to see as far as lies in their power that the laws so enacted are duly enforced. The gov eminent of India consider that this action is likely to be more satisfactory and effective than .uere declarations by the states of their Intentions. It Is hoped that this combined with the Information that Is already available will be sufficient to show that in respect to the states the Government of ne doingdoing what they can to discharge their responslhl- lities.

Sir, I am directed to refer to the letter from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ments NO 068 I-P., dated the 10th June 1928, (addressed to the Government of 2. The position disclosed by the replies to the above mentioned letter was generally satisfactory and indicated that with one exception, which has since been rectified, neither slavery nor conditions analo gous to slavery existed in any Indian State. Certain instances where recourse was had to compulsory labour- were, however, disclosed, but in the great majority of Bombay. Bihar and Orissa ana ) tho Central Provinces.)■mhmhmmmhhhhhhhhhhhh of States such labour was only employed when the public interest dictated it and was suitably recom pensed, and in instances where such labour was levied by private land owners and employers, steps have oeen taken to check the practice 0 3„ since that date many States have taken the opportunity of rendering their position completely satisfactory, and the Government of India consider that the time has now come when the matter could be placed on a more regular basis 0 The majority ox the larger states, where a high standard of adminis tration exists, have placed the matter on the ourne footing as in British India, by reproducing in tue State law legislation on the lines of Sections 367, 370, 371 and 374 of the Indian Penal Code, and where recourse to compulsory labour was unavoidable ioi administrative reasons, providing for it by a special enactment laying down the terms upon which it might be levied and the wages to be paid. The Government of India feel that this plan should be followed, ana that similar action should be taken as early as possible by all States where this has not already been done. It must, be remembered that the puolic conscience is more sensitive in these matters than was formerly the case, and any State which fail^ to secure the elementary rights of private individuals by adequate legislation lays itself open to the suspicion that practices are tolerated in ins terri tories which are not in accord with modern sentiment, This will undoubtedly give rise to unfavourable criticism from British India and the more advanced States, which the. Government of India would not be in a position to check. 44o I am to request, therefore, that you will he good enough to address all States in which legislation on the lines of Sections 367, 370, 371 and 374 of the Indian Penal Code does not already exist, and urge upon them the necessity of embodying such provisions in their Codes. The Government of India will be glad to learn as soon as possible the results of your references and to receive detailed information as to the position in this respect in all the States in your political charge, including information in regard to any regulations or rules having the force of law which authorise forced labour for any purpose in any of the States concerned. 5. If it should appear at any future date that enactments for the suppression of slavery and forced labour are being evaded, I am to request that the attention of the State may immediately be drawn to this and an explanation obtained. If the explanation is unsatisfactory, the facts should immediately be report ed to the Government of India.
