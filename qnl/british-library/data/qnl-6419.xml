D ES PA TCH from LORD STANLEY to the GOVE R N 0 R- G K N E R A L, dated Zrd of February, 1859, and sent on that day. Importance of advices lately received from Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. Object of our diplomacy and military expeditions in Persia and Afghanistan yet to be attained. “ Russo-Persian influence must not be suffered to be dominant at Herat.” Governor-General’s opinions on questions suggested by present posture of Asiatic politics requested. Her Majesty’s Government conceive it to be desirable to establish a British agent at Herat, in subordination to the minister at Tehran. Governor- General will select an offieer for this post. Major Lumsden,or Major M. Green, proper persons for such an appointment, but Governor-General’s choice not fettered. Two assistants and a medical officer to accompany the agent; one assistant to be at Candahar. With reference to general policy to be observed by agent, Lord Clarendon’s letter to Mr. Murray of 29th of May, 1857, may be consulted. Governor-General will consider how to supply the mission with money. Lavish expenditure of other nations not to be competed with, but funds required for occasional disbursements. Allowances of the mission to be determined bj Governor- General. DESPATCH from LORD STANLEY to GOVERNOR-GENERAL, dated \0th of February, 1859, and sent same day. Time of departure, route, and ostensible object of mission to Herat, adverted to in above despatch of the 3rd of February, must depend on circumstances of the hour, with which Governor-General must be better acquainted than Home Government. Whatever the ostensible object, the best means must be considered, “ of associating the interests of Dost Muhammad with those of the Biitish, and of securing his cordial support and co-operation in prose- “ cutin 8“ our measures.” Her Majesty’s Government imperfectly in formed as to the course adopted in the matter of Dost Muhammad’s No. 8.subsidy. Butin the present state of their information, mid subject - to such explanations as may be offered, they are disposed to doubt the policy oj its discontinuance. DRAFT of Proposed DESPATCH from LORD STANLEY to the GOVERNOR-GENERAL, April, 1859. Since despatches of February 3rd and 10th were sent, Governor- General’s letter of February 2*2nd, enclosing Major Lumsden’s report on Afghanistan, has arrived, with the notes of Colonel Edw r ardes and Sir J. Lawrence. It is the concurrent opinion of these three officers, that “ the “ British Government should cease from its efforts to secure by diplomacy “ the independence of Herat, and, withdrawing from all political interference “ in Afghanistan,should limit its defensive operation to its own frontier.” It is contended that the independence of Herat is an unattainable chimera ; but Her Majesty’s Government are of opinion that “ by ceasing altogether “ from the efforts to maintain Herat independence they would expedite “ its annexation to Persia,” and deem it “ a legitimate! object of diplo- “ macy to retard what they may not be able eventually to prevent.” The fortified posts recommended by Colonel Edwardes would be a work of years and of excessive expense, and it appears to be sound policy, even if this measure should be ultimately adopted, to make every exertion in the interval to foil “ the aggressive spirit ” of Persia. Her Majesty’s Government, therefore, adhere to the proposed plan of dispatching a mission to Herat, not to interfere with the internal politics of the country, “ but to watch the proceedings of other States, and to “ establish such an influence with the de facto Governments of Cabul, “ Candahar, and Herat, as will obstruct the advances of hostile states to “ the Indian frontier.” Importance of Dost Muhammad’s co-operation again referred to. Experience has demonstrated that the Barakzye family alone can hold the Afghans in subjection. Seventeen years have passed since Dost Muhammad was restored from his captivity in India to his throne; and every year has added to the consolidation of his power ; but at his demise the present tranquillity of his dominions may be disturbed, and it is expe dient that British interests should be represented in such a crisis, with due regard to the not identifying them with those of any particular claimant of power. In the present state of Indian finance, Her Majesty’s Government would regret the necessity for entailing expense on the Indian treasury; but “ any moderate expenditure by which the maintenance of our influence “ in Afghanistan may be accomplished,” must be viewed “ as a conservative “ and economical measure, from which it would be narrow policy to shrink.” * Words added by Lord Stanley in his own handwriting. t Sir H. Rawlinson notes opposite this paragraph, that, owing to the treaty of Paris, “ the maintenance of some political relations with the chiefs of Cabul, Candahar, and Herat, “ has to a certain extent become obligatory on the Government of India .’ 1 See especially Conclusion of Article YI.2^ £. r 1 3 NOTE by SIR J. LAWRENCE. In order to give a British agent at Herat a chance of success, he must be able to expend considerable sums annually on the chiefs and influential men, who would take his gifts and those of his opponents, and then act as caprice or interest might dictate. The chiefs of Cabul and Candahar will view the presence of a British agent at Herat with jealousy, and still more jealously the presence of one at their own capitals. Any party hostile to the regnant chief would not hesitate to attack the mission, in hopes of compromising the chief. The Afghans, after what has occurred, distrust our officers, and any mistake on the part of our agents would probably lead to a collision. The Afghans saw that the English mission to Cabul was followed by invasion, and they fully believe that the English still wish for the country. In the civil war sure to ensue on Dost Muhammad’s death, the posi tion of our officers would be still more precarious. If Peshawar and Kohat were restored, this might go far to change the distrust of the Afghans towards us to cordiality. NOTE by SIR G. CLERK. A mission would not be sent into Afghanistan, unless there were good grounds for supposing it would be acceptable. A permanent esta blishment is not to be thought of, unless it were sought for by friendly states. Conciliatory conduct and unobtrusive measures often lead to bene ficial results, without purchasing popularity by great outlays. To intrigue and bribe against Russia would be a mistake, but the presence of an English gentleman, as an accredited Government agent’ might be advantageous to Afghan, as well as to British interests. Our character can suffer only from such agents as Zainu-’l-Abidin; * by presumption, duplicity, and foiled intrigue like his. Without underrating the evils of an antagonism to Russia, adverted to by Sir J. Lawrence, it may be contended that, with agents skilfully This man, British agent in Khurasan, was party to the attempt of Prince Muhammad Riza to dethrone the present ruler of Herat.4 selected, and honest perseverance, such antagonism may be removed, and a new relation, founded on good feeling, be commenced with the states of Central Asia, tending to the advancement of civilization, where now all is stagnation. The impression left on the Afghan mind by our invasion was not that we should be likely to repeat that egregious folly, but surprise at our having ever committed it. This was the sentiment courteously but unreservedly expressed by Dost Muhammad, in his many conversations with Sir G. Clerk, then Mr. Clerk, Envoy at the Court of Lahore. NOTE by SIR H. RAWLINSON. Would not recommend missions to Afghanistan, could the neutrality of that country be obtained by treaty or otherwise. But to shut ourselves up within our own frontiers, would be to throw the Afghans into the arms of our enemies, and thus invite, rather than postpone, attack. A war has broken out in which Russia and France will act in concert, and against England. France is notoriously jealous of our Eastern empire. Russia has to avenge injuries, and to gratify ambition. Her influence in Persia has long been paramount: she is now extending it eastward with alarming rapidity as follows:—She threatens Khiva from the Aral; sends troops against the Turkumans of the Attrack ; is massing her forces in Georgia; has made a treaty with Bukhara; has a formidable mission at Herat, whence officers have visited Afzal Khan* at Balkh and Kunduz, and Shir Ali Khan at Kandahar, and have been traced among the Eimaks and Hazarahs at Khaf and Kain, and even in Sistan. They may be expected on the frontiers of Sindh and the Panjab, and have failed only at Kabul, and there solely on account of Dost Muhammad’s honesty and sagacity. Russia, allied with Persia, and supporting the Afghans, is more than a menace—is a danger on our frontier. But, besides, there is the probability of Sultan Ahmad Khan’s consolidating the three Afghan principalities under his sway at his uncle’s death ; and Russia has con ciliated, we have exasperated him. Sir J. Lawrence’s objections are for the most part self-evident; but our course is but a choice of evils, and the question seems to resolve itself into one of expense. If the cost of the forts recommended by Col. Edwardes be calculated, and of the other military preparations to meet invasion, we shall see that it would be a saving to expend any sum, less than the interest of that money, in keeping the danger at a distance from the frontier. Sums * Son of Dost Muhammad, appointed by him Governor of Kunduz.lb spent with political objects in Persia and Afghanistan, must be looked on as the insurance premium for India. Supposing Sir J. Lawrence’s and Col. Edwardes’ plan to cost twenty millions, one million might be spent a year to postpone such an outlay. As to jealousy and animosity towards the English, Herat is not in the same category as the other capitals of Afghanistan. Blood has never flowed between us. Our intercourse has been a series of benefits from us to them. The Persians they hate, and must be ill-disposed towards the Russians, as the allies of the Persians. The present state of Herat is exceptional. Ahmad Khan would join us if he had the option. At present he is jealous of Dost Muhammad, and angry with us for supporting, as he thinks, his Suddozye rival. It would be requisite to expend some money to show we were in earnest, but not to the extent the Russians have gone ; and there is no reason to think a mission would not be well received. Could we induce Dost Muhammad to engage to respect the independence of Herat on condition of our vestoring to him Peshawar and Kohat, there would be legitimate ground for deputing a mission to Herat. This would also strengthen our position with the Shah, as removing one element of discord in the presumed designs of Dost Muhammad on Herat. Real questions as to Herat are : 1st, its prolonged independence ; 2nd, osten sible object of sending a mission there; 3rd, conduct and expense of the mission. Mission might proceed through Persia. During the present European war Herat must be subsidized to such an extent as to give us there a dominant position. Establishment of missions at Kabul and Kandahar far more questionable. At the latter place a mission unnecessary at present, but at Kabul a British officer must occa sionally be seen. Dost Muhammad has strong claims to the continuance of his subsidy, as, at our request, he declined M. Khanikoff’s visit. An officer might advantageously be sent to notify that the subsidy would be continued, and might negotiate for the independence of Herat, and restoration of Peshawar and Kohat. These provinces would afford a means of putting a pressure on Kabul—which state cannot be neutral. Unless British envoys are constantly passing and repassing we shall see a Russian envoy fixed in the Bala Hissar. The danger of tumults at the Dost’s deatli ought not to deter us from having an envoy on the spot, who might regulate the succession, and prevent the effusion of blood. B0 NOTE by MR. WILLOUGHBY. Since May, 1831, has not had access to correspondence from Persia and Afghanistan, but saw all despatches previous to that. Our course only a choice of difficulties. If we send missions, we must expend large sums, and may very possibly embroil ourselves. If we do not send missions, we abandon the field to Russian diplomacy and gold. The invasion of 1838-9, ought to teach us the Afghans are jealous of foreign rule, that no treaty or sum will bind them to what they think contrary to their interests. Our policy, therefore, must be shaped according to the events of the day. We obtained demonstration also of the difficulty a European army would experience in invading Afghanistan, and that such an invasion would be best met by us at the Bolan and Khybar. Meanwhile our chief reliance for counteracting the intrigues of Russia must be in the ability of our minister at Tehran. In a struggle with Russia, however, or any European power, the battle must be fought in Europe, while an expeditionary force to the Gulf would coerce Persia, if she joined our enemies. The great objection to establishing a mission in Afghanistan is the risk of exciting the suspicions of the people, and of having the mission insulted and ejected as that of Major Tod was in 1839-40. If, however, a mission be resolved upon, it should go from Persia, rather than India, should be of a simple and unpretending character, “in “ fact, not an expensive diplomatic mission, but an agent of tact and “ discretion, whose principal object should be to ascertain what is going “ on, and to counteract any designs inimical to British interests.” NOTE by MR. KAYE. Much force in Sir J. Lawrence’s objections ; but our course a choice of evils, and the mission appears to be attended with the least evils. More desirable now than at any time, since the Tilsit agreement, to secure the friendly offices of the Afghan chiefs. To remain within our frontier, is to leave the field clear to unscrupulous competitors. Activity of Russia in Central Asia quite notorious. M. Khanikoff’s influence established at Herat. Dost Muhammad rejected his overtures,7 but may not always be.in this mood, and no doubt thinks lie has a claim to a substantial acknowledgment from England for his steadfastness to her. It may be sound policy to renew his subsidy. Russia, rebuffed from Kabul, may attempt to extend Sultan Ahmad’s influence .to the East, and we must endeavour to prevent this. The restoration of Peshawar, or the holding out a hope of its restoration, would probably insure Dost Muhammad’s support. The moral effect throughout India of our withdrawal from this advanced post must be considered, and the opinion of the Indian Government invited. If Dost Muhammad should die, and a struggle for his throne take place, we must be neutral; and though some embarrassing results may arise from the presence of a British agent on the scene of conflict, worse would happen were we to leave the field clear for Russia. To obviate any jealousy at Herat as to our proceedings at Kabul, we must show Sultan Jan that our object in strengthening the Kabul chief is not to weaken Herat, but to secure Afghan independence generally. Expense in establishing the Herat mission may be necessary, and, if so, will be in the end the cheapest course. The worst that could happen for us is, that the Afghan principalities should be consolidated under one chief, moved by Russo-Persian influence. This may happen if Sultan Ahmad is allowed free scope, aided by Russian gold. We may fail at Herat, but our failure will be the work of time, and then our success at Kabul, which we have no reason to doubt, would be all the more advantageous to us. Sir J. Lawrence, on the 15th of November, 1858, recommended non intervention, till the policy of Russia was disclosed. That policy is now disclosed by the movement on Khiva, the Bukhara embassy, and the emissaries of Russia who peregrinate Afghanistan. With such intrigues on foot, we also must be active, and colourable pretexts can easily be devised by the Indian Government for sending agents to Afghanistan. Late intelligence, which mentions that Colonel Taylor has been deputed to Herat, would indeed show that we have already taken the first step in a policy which must now be carried out.MAJOR LUMSDEN’S report. Major Lumsdeii’s rnission arose out of the following circumstances : On the 8th of January, 1857, Dost Muhammad* personally entered into a treaty with the English Government, at Peshawar, at a conference with the Chief Commissioner of the Panjab, binding himself, in consideration of a monthly subsidy of Rs. 100,000 during the continuance of the war with Persia, to keep up a certain number of regular troops for the defence of Afghanistan, and agreeing that British officers should be deputed to any part of his dominions to aid the Afghans, if required, and to see that the subsidy was properly applied. A mission, consisting of Major Lumsden, Lieutenant Lumsden, and Dr. Bellew, with Ghulam Sarwar Khan Khagwani, and Nuwab Faujdar Khan Bahadur, left Peshawar on the 13th of March, and reached Kan dahar on the 26th of April, 1857. The news of the peace between England and Persia was w'ell received by the Afghans, and the officers of the mission exerted themselves to conciliate them; but the outbreak of the great Indian rebellion caused much excitement, which was fanned into a flame by the Peshawar chiefs, Sardars, Sultan Muhammad Khan, and Pir Muhammad Khan. At last, the great mass of the Afghan nation urged Dost Muhammad to put himself at their head, and commence a holy war against the infidel English, and the Amir was on the point of yielding to the cry, when his son, Muhammad Azim Khan, succeeded in dissuading him. On the fall of Delhi the danger subsided. The Persians, also, were anxiously watching the tide of events in India, and even after the evacuation of Herat,f and hovered on the frontier for a time in strong masses, ready to advance in case of reverses to the English arms. A demonstration of the fanatical spirit of the Afghans was given at this timej; at Kandahar. A young Hindu, an alleged convert to Islam, was said to have returned to idolatry, and the heir apparent, Sardar Ghulam Haidar Khan, to have connived at this backsliding. The mullas or clergy of Kandahar rose in open revolt, were joined by many of the chiefs and soldiers, and the heir apparent was compelled to imprison the boy’s father, as a guarantee that the boy would be given up when he returned from Shikarpur, to which place he had absconded. Trom this and many other proofs of the bigotry of the Afghans, from the poverty and difficulty of their country, from their hatred to strangers, and the impolicy of advancing beyond that natural base of operations which belongs to us along the Indus and the Sulaiman mountains, Major * Page 193. t On the 27th July, 1857, p. 195. X In February, 1858, p. 19(3.9 Lumsden draws his conclusions as to the inexpediency of entering Afghanistan, or interfering with the internal politics of the country. His views are contained in the paragraphs of his report 82 to 93 inclusive, which are as follows — “ 82. I now feel myself called on to express (although I do so with “ the greatest diffidence) my opinion with regard to the policy to be for the “ future adopted towards Afghanistan and in Central Asia generally. As “ might have been expected, the accounts of the mutiny in the Bengal “ army have spread in an exaggerated form from one end of the great “ continent to the other; and crafty politicians have not failed to make “ use of it for their own purposes. Russian influence weighs down the “ balance against us in Persia, and the scales in Herat are thereby “ affected. Muscovite policy has now reached Kokhan. Mongolia is her «• “ province, and her legions are rapidly closing on China. Afghanistan, “ therefore, stands isolated, as the only country free of the Russain taint, “ and to keep her so should be our great aim ; but how to attain such a “ result naturally becomes the question, and one on which I am fully “ aware that many of our ablest diplomatists have greatly differed. My own “ conviction is, that this object will be best attained by having as little to “ say to Afghans as possible, beyond maintaining friendly and intimate “intercourse with the de facto Government; by never, on any occasion, “ interfering with the internal politics of the country, nor assisting any “ particular faction, but honestly leaving Afghans to manage their own “ affairs in the way which suits them best. We should endeavour to pre- 44 vent the interference of Persia, or any other power, in these matters, 44 and be careful that all our political agents on the frontier are fully in- 44 structed in the views of Government and carrying out a common policy; 44 for the slightest deviation in the opinions expressed by these officers, 44 will be eagerly caught at by designing intriguers in the country, as 44 a proof of sinister designs on our part, and to work out their own 44 ends. 83. Unless under the most pressing danger to Afghanistan, and 44 at the spontaneous and urgent demand of that Government itself no pro- 44 position involving the deputing of British officers into the country should “for a moment he entertained. For (after the example of Burnes) all 44 such missions will ever be looked on with the greatest suspicion, no 44 matter how able the officers to be employed, or what their object. If 44 the rulers really wish for the services of such men, they will be quick 44 enough in asking for them ; for modesty has never been an Afghan 44 weakness. 84. Of all schemes that England has ever undertaken, none have 44 cost her proportionately more, or have been altogether so unsuccessful, as her attempts at establishing an independent state in Herat. Two * Page 234. C“ wars, the first the most disastrous on record, together with an expendi- “ ture of some seventeen millions of money, have been the icsu t “ the project; and the effect produced is, that while a Persian nominee, “ supported by Persian money and Russian counsels, acknowledges in “ words that Herat is independent (although he himself openly once a “ week confesses the sovereignty of Persia, by having the ‘ Khutbah “ read in the name of the Shah, and sees two provinces of Herat occu- “ pied by the Russians), we are content. Surely it requires no demon- “ stration to prove that a continuance of such a policy would be an error. “At the same time I am convinced that had we, when masters of “ the Persian shores, dictated our own terms, and insisted on Herat being “ given over once for all to the Afghans, and their ruler the Amir, the “ result would have been far more satisfactory. “ 85. But, after all, the question is, what is the real value of the “ independence of Herat to us? Of course, had that state possessed the “ vitality necessary to struggle for its own independence, it would ha\e “ been our interest to assist her in a moderate way, and thus to stave off “ the evil day as long as possible; but, when we find Herat alternately “ the prey of Persians and Afghans, surely it is mere self-deception to “ suppose that it can ever present the slightest obstacle to a Russian “ invasion of India, whenever it may suit that power to enter on such an “ undertaking ; and the position of that fortress, upwards of five hundred “ miles in advance of our border, precludes the possibility of our placing “ a British garrison in it, which is now the only sure way of securing the “ place against all comers. “ 86. There are but three routes in this direction by which an army “ could possibly move towards Hindustan, even were Persia and Russia to “ make common cause in such an enterprise. “ 1st. From Karman through Sistan and Kandahar. “ 87. This is the route which was followed by Mir Vaiz, at the head “ of his Ghilzye and Afghan troops, about the commencement of the last “ century, when he attacked Persia. The want of supplies, and the arid “ nature of a portion of the country traversed, would prevent this line “ ever being used by a regular invading army, though Light Irregular “ Horse might go by it, “ 88.—2nd route. If, instead of following the above route, a force “ should move by Nyband and Barjun, more water would be found, “ and at the latter place it joins the road from Yezd, via Tubbas, a sketch “of which is laid down in Kinneir’s map of Persia, and this is a line “ which has frequently been adopted by Persian troops, and is the direct “ approach from Yezd on Sistan and Farah. “ 89.—3rd route. This is the direct road from Herat to Kandahar, “ which includes within the zone of its operations all the different routes51 'Wonl, together witl m Ofey, have bee, , 3 '^- 8 -‘hatwl, ilea p ! here ^»f lssia » eo Un ,elv 1 n ,“ 0 ' ineC ' houvli he h °*%* i» ■rsia , \ “^^'neea s ' t I ha,, '« tlle ‘Khutbah' I P™'” 068 »f Herat „cc„. ” re ) it requires no demon- ,® U f 'f'^Mheanerror. 3 l ' vl we ’ '’hen masters of ™s, and insiste,] on He rat bei and their ruler the Amir, the ctorv.

The “ feasibility of this route is beyond doubt, and the resources upon it have “ been so frequently detailed by men conversant with the subject, that “ I need not here repeat them. By no other line* can India be approached, “ save by an army crossing the Hindu Kush, or passing Kabul, the “ difficulties of which are beyond calculation. “ 90. It will be remarked that all these routes lead vid Kandahar, “ on the Bolan. It, therefore, strikes me that our obvious course now is “ to discard all idea of Herat being an outwork of Hindustan; and “instead of squandering our resources on the doubtful friendship of “ distant native governments, to fix on some really defensible line, over which we can have some control. “ 91. Providence has blessed us with a strong line of frontier, “ covered by rugged and barren hills, through which there are but a limited “number of passes by which any army could approach India; and the “ military art teaches us that the best position for the defence of such “ ground is on our side of the passes, just where an army must debouch on “ the plain ; here, then, is our true position, which we are of course, in “ common prudence, bound to strengthen in every possible way. Of the “ nature and extent of the preparations required it is not for me to speak, “as they would be determined by the general and engineer officers “intrusted with the defence of the frontier; but the most important “and first to be attended to is the opening up of our communications “ with the real base of all military operations in India, the Sea, and con- “ necting these distant points with it by rails and steamers. ir Vaiz, at the head ncement of the last iplies, and the arid 1 prevent this line rh Light Irregular bove route, a force . would lie j(f Tubbas, a sketch fliis is a li ne “ 92. With Peshawar, Kohat, and Sindh in our possession, and the “ communication with our Indian provinces open by rails and steamers on “ the Indus, and a strong force of Europeans located in healthy eanton- “ ments all over the country, supported by a well-organized Native army, “ I consider that we should really have the keys of India in our own “ pockets, and be in a position to lock the doors in the face of all enemies, “ white or black. “ 93. At the same time, I would strongly advocate the carrying out “ a conciliatory policy towards our hill neighbours, but bearing in mind “ the real Pathan character, which the touch of money only renders the “more rapacious; that will swear to anything for filthy lucre, but only “ respect that power which shows ability to punish with the one hand “ and reward with the other. Our Peshawar authorities have, ever since “ the Panjab became ours, pursued a policy towards the Afridi tribes, the ■outes * Hence, if this one line be effectually closed to an enemy, India is beyond fear of invasion. mtm] 12 “ fruits of which are already ripening, and which in a few more years “ must lead to the happiest results. The district of Terrah, at the head “ of the Barrah river, is an independent country, where the proverbially “ lawless clans of the Khybar have their mountain homes, to which they “ retire during the summer months, descending again in winter to the “ lower itmge for forage for their cattle, and to escape the rigour of the “ winter blasts. These tribes are allowed free access to our territory so “ long as they behave themselves ; but the moment an individual is found “ to have abused this liberty, his whole tribe is shut out until the offender “ is given up, or a heavy fine paid. These Afridis now enlist freely into “ our frontier regiments, and when taken young, make obedient, good « soldiers. These tribes now consider our service as the great field for “ all the young aspirants of their clans, and are day by day being drawn closer to us, and must eventually see that they really have a common “ interest with us; when (especially as we have the sons and nephews “ 0 f their chiefs as Native officers in our corps), they may be expected to “join heartily with us in the defence of the Khybar, should any enemy “ ever attempt that line of road.” NOTE by COLONEL EDWARDES. Upon these views of Major Lumsden, Col. Edwardes has recorded a memorandum, in which he expresses his entire concurrence with them. He expresses his regret that England should be still “ bent upon realizing “ the dream of Herat independence, and speaks of the countenance lent to the Shahzadah Muhammad Riza’s attempt to dethrone Sultan Ahmad, as follows:—“ I must say, then, that I regard Mr. Murray’s failure at Herat “ as a melancholy escape for our real interests; and now let us meddle “ there no more, but look around for other measures of precaution which “ may be prosecuted in peace with honour, and in war with success.” Col. Edwardes then turns to the consideration of Major Lumsden’s scheme for fortifying our frontier below the passes, and after showing how the railroads will enable us to bring troops to the point of attack, adds : “ All that remains, therefore, is to crown these lines with a chain of forts “ from Peshawur to Karachee, and unite them to the railway by good “ roads, a bridge tit Attock, and an effective flotilla of river steamers on “ the Indus.” Of the expense of this fortification, Colonel Edwardes gives no esti mate, nor would it, perhaps, be possible to do so until the schemes are definitely laid before the engineers.
