Dated, 22nd January 1948. My dear Pelly, I visited Qatar yesterday, Wednesday the 21st of January 1948, and was informed that all our Sikh personnel have applied for permission to return to India during the coming month of February. The Sikh employees of P.C.l. in Bahrain have also requested in writing their desire to return to India at the same time as the Qatar Sikhs. I was also given to understand by the Field’s Manager in Qatar that it had come to the notice of our rUmployment Officer, Mr. Watkins, and our newly appointed Security Officer, Mr. F.W. Haugh, that a quantity of knives and other weapons were in the possession of our Indian employees in Oatar, both Hindoos and Muslims. For some time past we are given to understand that our Sikh employees, both in Qatar and in Bahrain, have been threatened by members of the other Indian communities. Should any acts of violence occur amongst these Indian employees of all religions it is possible that serious^consequences will result in view of their being in possession of the above-mentioned weapons. I would very gratefully appreciate your advice on whether it would be permissible for the Qatar Management to institute a search in order to discover these weapons, and also what action we should take against the possessors of the weapons in question. I have previously written letters addressed to the Agency on the question of the appointment of Special Constables in Qatar similar to the organisation in Bapco. I give below the names of those who have been recommended as nominees by the Field’s Manager : !• Mr. F.W.Haugh 2. ” J. Perry 3. M W. Skinner 4. ” W, Smith 5. ” J.L.McLeod 6.

Dear Sir Rupert, I enclose a copy of a letter which I have received from Lermitte. I propose to tell him that I think P.C.L. should get rid of their Sikh employees forthwith either by giving them leave or, if necessary, dismissing them. 2. I write to ask you that the regulation for the appointment of special constables for Qatar ('The Special police Officers Regulation, 1947') be declared urgent under Article 85(i) of the Qatar Order-in-Council, 1938, and be made by you forthwith. I will then appoint these special constables suggested by Lermitte as, I think, their appointment will have a good effect on the morale of the camp at Dukhan as well as legalising any powers they are able to exercise. I put it this way because, as in the case of the proposed search, it is rather a matter of what they can do as special constables rather than what they ought to do. Lermitte could not give me the exact numbers when I spoke to him this afternoon, but even if it were shown to be practicable and likely to lead to the desired result there seems to me a possi bility of danger in the proposal whereby a few Europeans /should search.... The Hon’ble Lt-Col. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.- 2 - should search, it might be, up to a thousand Indians - the latter’s hostility might be turned on to those attempting to search them. I have heard verbally of similar fears amongst Sikhs employed by the British Overseas Airways Corpor ation although the Station Superintendent has not reported them to me. I believe, though I have had^no written report, that the Sikhs in BAPCO also all want to go away. At first sight it would seem peculiar that the Sikhs should be fearful while the large Hindu com munity here has expressed no such fears. My own opinion, ) and this is borne out by such inquiries as I have been able to make, is that the Sikhs are frightened because they know so well what damage their brothers in the Punjab have done to the Muslims. Yours sincerely, NSCONFIDENTIAL POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 4th February. 1948 D.O. No. C/162 © Dear Sir Rupert, The number of Sikhs employed by Petroleum Concessions, Limited, in Qatar is only nine, and the number of Indian Mohammedans who are said to be pre paring to attack them, is about 50. I saw'Lerraitte again about this this afternoon, and suggested that P.C.L. dismiss the Muslim ring leaders of the movement against the Sikhs if they can be discovered. Lormitte promised to take this suggestion up with his people in Qatar. This is in continuation of my demi-official Yours sincerely % The Hon’ble Lt-Col. Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bahrain. NSD.0. NO. C/219.

I am also asking Hudson to find you, if possible, a copy of the Criminal procedure Code to which they may want to refer. I am not, however, suggesting that the subtleties of legal procedure should be studied. As you will readily appreciate, the powers should only be used when needed and exercised with tact. Yours sincerely. B.R. Lermitte, Esq., Manager, Messrs, petroleum Concessions, Ltd., Bah ra in .NOTE OH THE DUTIES OF A SPECI AL POLICE OFFICER. 1.

Since long time some Muslim Leaguers have been doing open propaganda against Hindus and Sikhs ..... It reached its intensity after getting intermingled with the Palestine agitation. Only a few weeks ago the Jews were subjected to loot, rape and murder and the repetition can be expected on the Hindus and Sikhs The local Arab, Persian and Baluch inhabitants are infUll sympathy with the newly-born 'Muslim Nation'.' [ We shall be grateful if a full report on the communal situation in the Persian Gulf could be furnished to this Ministry, with your comments. 3. The government of India would be glad if such measures as are possible could be taken to ensure the safety of Indian Nationals in Bahrain. Yours si near My, Sd/- H. Dayal .R.

To save delay and in view of your absence I have replied without waiting to hear from you. I enclose a copy of my reply. 3. If you have anything to add to it please Political Agent, BAHRAIN CoisficIentiaL BAHRAIN RECEIPT,, ' LB'SECRET ^0,tlo,&gt;565 r S PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY BAHRAIN Dated the llth March, 1948 Please refer to your demi-official letter No.F.17(18)- AWT/48 dated the 3.9th February, 1948, about the communal situation in the Persian Gulf. 2* There was some anti-Jewish rioting in Bahrain at the beginning of December, and subsequently some anonymous posters appeared in the Manamah bazaar threatening both Jews and Sikhs. There were also austepeus rumours that the Pakistani Muslim employees of Petroleum Development (Qatar), Limited in the Qatar peninsula intended to attack the Company^ Sikh employees. As a result most of the Sikhs in Bahrain and Qatar have left for India. 3. So far as India and Pakistani subjects were concerned to the best of my knowledge up to date there have been no actual incidents of a communal nature. There Is no sign of tension between Hindus and Pakistani Muslims and I hardly think it necessary at present to ask the Bahrain Government to take any special measures for the protection of Indian nationals, especially as such measures might have a provocative effect. The anti-Jewish disturb ances at the beginning of December arose suddenly and were of short duration. Since then the situation has been normal and there Is no reason to think that the Bahrain Government*s police would not be able to deal quickly and effectively with any communal trouble that may arise. Should however the situation show any signs of deteriorating I will do my best to see that all possible measures are taken to ensure the safety of Indian nationals in Bahrain. In Qatar special police officers have been appointed from amongst the Oil Company's employees and given powers to enable them to deal with communal trouble should any arise. fi* No reports have been received of any communal trouble elsewhere in the Gulf States. -S^/- W.R.
