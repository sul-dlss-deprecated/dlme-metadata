My dear Fowle, It lias been borne in on zec Llore c nc [roj*e on uhe Truelal Coast that it is a great. *ity that tne old leisurely Political Resident’s tours, yearly or tv\ice yearly, are no longer carried out. *he Shaikhs no longeriaiow him as a personal friend and, as you have so often said, of recent years Political Officers have almost always had to appear in the role of the daughters of the horse leech! Ine value of a friendly visit is well illustrated by the effect of my visit to Abu Bhabi ih December, when I took a doctor ana a geologist (the first time v* had done anything for him) and circumstances allowed me to do nothing beyond being friendly. I believe that if you could manage a quiet tour v th a couple of days at each place, it would ma£e an immense difference. £• Possibly a solution of the difficulty of accommod be got over by hiring £.#T Nearchus. I understand that she has a ^royal suite' which is comfortable and sufficiently roomy and also other accommodation, and that it might be possible (if a cautious ap; roach of Ward was made) to hire her for a few days in the course of one of her lighting and buoving cruises. I hope that you will forgive my interloping, ryself In a matter which does not directly concern me, but I hap. ened to hear ^'this possibility and thought toat it might be of use to you to know of It.

G. would only have to put his nose in an Indian State to be supplied with at least 3 cars on loan for the duration of his visit. When I was here before and Shaikh Hamad eked out his existence on a paltry Z 15,000 a year I did not insist upon the State ^provide^the Resident with a car and usually drove him round myself on his visits which seldom exceeded two or three days. 2. Kbw, however, that the Shaikh has more money than he can conceivably spend, I see no reason why he should not be asked to lend me a car, for which I would of course find the petrol and oil. I am sure that when Bin Saud visited Bahrain he placed many cars at his disposal^ and I think it will be a good thing if the idea were conveyed to him that the Political Resident is also worthy of some such attention.lA Telegram G.T.O* From To lolltloal Haaidentf at Bahrain* Secretary of State for Foreign Affair** London* Secretary of State for India* Loi don* Secretary to the Government of India* External Affaire Department# Simla* HI a Hajeftty 9 * x^abaeBador# Bagdad* Hie Majeaty 9 * Miiilater* Jedda* Hie Excellency the I^aval Gommander-in»dhief* The Air Officer Commanding* British Forcee The Senior Raral officer# Jereian Oilf* The Staff Officer iIntelligence) Colombo* The JPolltlcal A*;ent# Muscat* The lolltical Agent* Kuwait* Hia Hajeety 9 a Conaul* daarah* Ihe Officer Commanding SOS l FB)Squadron#Eaera# ihe Officer Command! ng 84(B)Squadron* Shaibah* The hcaldency Agent# Sharjah* The Kiddle &amp;aat Intelligence Centre*care Kfcjrptforoe* Cairo* Copy given to Political A^nt# Bahrain* B6.T/238* Dated the 16th September* 1939* Baat Indies* in Iraq* Habbaniya* Basra* CIKOULAH * Plaaae address all telegrams for me at Bahx'&amp;ln 'daaident Bahrain 11 * *» liSSIDHET* V* L* \COHFIDJSHTIAU The Hon'bXe the Political Resident in the Perei&amp;n Gulf presents his 1# The 2.

I am assuming that you propose to leave Sitra about 7 a.m. on Sunday, the23rd, and will be returning to Sit»a at 6 p.m. approximately on Monday. It is advisable, though not essential, to get back to Sit#a before dark. This means leaving Zekhrit not later than 1 p.m. If you left Doha on Monday morning by 8.30 you should have plenty of time to have an early lunch in Dukhan before leaving.. If you are short of time you can have your lunch put on the boat. In this case, perhaps you will be good enough to inform Dickson on Sunday before leaving for Doha. Dr. Storm is postponing his visit for a few days and will not be at Dhoha during your visit. Yours sincerely, Sd.

(b) I will then go to the Agency and receive the call from the Shaikh. (c) I will return the Shaikh^ call. (d) No salutes will be fired. 2. Please let me have any criticisms or suggestions you may have to make, if necessary by telegram, as I am unable to find much on record here about precedents. I should prefer that the Shaikh should not call on me on the •Nearchus* as my family will be on board and our landing may be considerably delayed. All gun salutes should be avoided as such salutes are not fired now on any occasion in India or, I believe, elsewhere in the Empire. If, however, the Shaikh insists on a gun salute being fired I will give way as I did on the occasion of my recent visit to Muscat. Mfjor T. Hickinbotham, O.B.E., Political Agent, Kuwait. E.B.

The exact dates of the Political Resident 1 s visit to the Trucial Coast cannot be fixed until the 'Nearchus' arrives at Bahrain (probably on April 11th) when the Resident will have an opportunity of speaking to the Captain. It is probable, however, that Colonel Hay and I will arrive on the 'Nearchus 11 at Abu Dhabi on the 16th April. We shall probably stay one night at Abu Dhabi and then go by car to Sharjah. We shall stay one night (or possibly two) at Sharjah and then go on to Ras al Khaimah where the Resident will re-embark on the Tt Nearchus M . 3. Will you please let the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi know of our projected visit. You will, I hope, be able to meet the Resident and myself at Abu Dhabi and arrange for our transport by car to Sharjah. 4. This programme is only provisional and I will send you a telegram as soon as a definite programme is fixed. 5. You will notice in the programme of the 'Nearchus'' tour that she will visit Kalba on the 25th of April. Will you please warn the Regent of Kalba that the Political Resi dent may be visiting Kalba about that date. I myself shall not be able to visit Kalba on this occasion.

On his Trucial Coast tour the Political Resident will be accompanied by Mr .Bertram Thomas (Public Relations \ Officer) as well as myself. Mr. Bertram Thomas is bringing cinema apparatus v/ith/suitable selection of news-reels so that he will be able to give cinema shows at Abu Dhabi and 3. The party will embark on the ^earchus 1 in the afternoon of Wednesday 15th April and will land at Abu Dhabi on the morning of Friday April 17th. You will, I hope, be at Abu Dhabi to meet us and will be ablo to arrange transport for the party from Abu Dhabi to Sharjah. 4. The Resident is bringing a considerable number of Toshakhana presents which it would be inconvenient to trans port by car from Abu Dhabi to Sharjah. He has therefore arranged for the ’Noarchus 1 to call at Sharjah on the after noon of April 17th to land this case of presents. Will you please arrange for your clerk to take delivery of this case. 5. The Resident and party will leave Abu Dhabi on the morning of Saturday April 18th for Sharjah. Exchange of calls with the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Dubai will take place in the afternoon after the Resident’s arrival if this is possible. You will, no doubt, make the necessary a / arrangements Khan Sahib Abdur Razzaq, Residency Agent, Sharjah.- 2 - arrangements in regard to these calls. 6. On Sunday the 19th April the Resident 1 s programme must, for the preiant, remain indefinite. He would like, if possible to pay a visit by air to Kalba but this project depends on whether R.A.F. aircraft are available. Alter natively he would like to see something of Dubai including a visit to the hospital and bazaar. 7. On Monday April 20th the narty will leave Sharjah by car fairly early in the morning and the Resident will visit the Shaikhs of Ajman, Hamriya and Umm al Quaiwain en route to Ras al Khaimah. The Political Resident will embark at Ras al Khaimah on the evening of that day i.e. April 20th. Mr. Bertram Thomas and I will remain at Res al Khaimah for the night and return to Sharjah on 21st April. Prom Sharjah Mr. Bertram Thomas will return to Bahrain by motor launch and I will either accompany him or return by air, whichever is the quickest. 8.

Dated the 24th April, 1942. From •» The Ron’ble Lieut. — Colonel .R.Hey, ^liii# f Political Resident in the Fereian Gulf, To • The Secretary to the uovemment of India, External Affairs Department, 1 ew Delhi. Sir, 1 have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a note on a tour i have recently completed on the Trucial Coast. 2. The Trucial Coast has not as yet felt the pinch of the war. The Shaikhs, thanks to Fetroleum Concessions Limited, the British Overseas Airways Corporation, etc. are drawing what are for them fat incomes, business is flourishing and the people are making an easy living out of their legitimate pursuits combined with a certain amount of smuggling into Persia. They have now however heard that supplies from India are to be curtails ed and this combined with Royal Air Force activities is c&amp;us-* ing them much anxiety, 'fchen will there be peace ?* asked the Shaikh of Has al Khaim&amp;h and this indicates the attitude of the public at large. Unite whole tney are very friendly to us and would like us to win, but whatever happens they want the war to end before it engulfs them. So far as local politics are concerned the atmosphere is extraoreinarily peaceful. There are a few intriguers about but generally speaking the Shaikhs are all firmly established and exercise undisputed authority. Their anxieties are of an economic nature and nearly every one of them had two requests to make, viz. (a) that an adequate fooc supply should he ensured for his Sh&amp;i^hcom and (b) tuat he shoulo he jproviced with spare parts etc. ior his car. 3. A large scale immigration is at present in progress from Persia to the Trucial Coast, and i am told that some times more / thanyt&lt; iii H—i i - 2 - than a thoueand immigrants arrive at Lubai in a day. They come partly because of the vastly superior living conditions onthe Truci&amp;l Coast ehere most of the necessities of life are still readily available and partly to meet the demand for labour on the aerodromes and buildings at Lubsi and Sharjah. * 4. i am sending a of this letter ana its enclosure to the Secretary of State for incia and Colonel Prior. I have the honour to be» 5ir» Yfrur most obeoient servant, sd. R. Hay. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. * sent under Printed Letter No.C/465 of 24th /pril 1942.#ot« on Truoial Coaat Tour - April 17th to 20th 1942. X «ae accompanied throughout the tour by Mr.Wakefield, Political Agent, Bahrain, and Mr.Bertram Thomas, Public Relations Officer, who brought his cinema with him. 2. «e landed at Abu bhabi on the morning of April 17th and spent the night there. The Bhaihh, ahakhbut bin Sultan, belongs to the Beni las and is probably the most influential Shaikh on the Trucial Coast, he ie a youngish man, illiterate but extreme ly intelligent. His affinities are with the iedu rather than with the settled Arab of the Coast, he became Shaikh through the assassination of his predecessor by one of bit uncles arid lives in constant dread pmL revenge at the hands of his predecess or*s partisans who live in Sharjah, with the money received from Petroleum Concessions Limited he has built himself a huge new fort with e smaller fort inside it. Eis income is about Rs.1,15,000 a year which includes one lakh from Petroleum Concessions Limited and about Rs.b,000 as rent from the aero drome. 3. We found the Shaikh extremely affable and he spent much time tailing to us on all sorts of subjects. In the evening Mr.Bertram Thomas showed some propaganda films in the 3]naikh , e fort. Kost of the inhabitants of Abu Lh&amp;bi aad never seen a cinema before and the display was receivec with tremendous enthusiasm. The most popular film was one showing Australia's resources of cattle, sheep and poultry, subjects which appealed to the Imagination of the local Arab far more than tanks and aircraf t. 4. we visited the bazaar at Abu Dhabi which is fairly well stocked but the place which depends largely on pearling is on the whole not in a very prosper cue condition. Some boats had already left lor the early diving and 8ore put out while we were there- 2 - b. un April 18th we tr&amp;rellec Xiozl Abi, to Sharjah by car* could not leave bet ore 10.30 *.it* as there ia a creek 8 miles from Abu Ibabi nhich can only be crossed at lo* tide. Ve reached Sharjah at about 4.30 p.m # and 1 received calls from the Shaikhs of Sharjah and Tubal* Propaganda films were shown to the people of Sharjah in the Agency tnat evening. They had seen similar films before and were not as enthusiastic as the people of Abu Dhabi. 6. un the morning of the 19th April i returned the Shaikh of Sharjah’s call and we visited the bharjah bazaar* The Shaikh, Sultan bin Sa^r, is about 3b or 40. he is literate and has quite a large library. He is vain arid somewhat unstable and not a very capable ruler, he is head of the Jowasimi family to which the SnaiiLhs of r*as al Khaim&amp;h and ilalba also belong. Somewhat appropriately he heads his notepaper 'Ruler of Sharjah and its Independencies”. Has al nhaimah which was at one time subject to bhar^ah is coaipletely independent and is recognised by us as such, hamriyah and iujaira which are nominally dependent on Sharjah are in fact independent and the Shaikh of Shar v ah has no influence in either place, uther members of his family, notably Shaikh ithalid. Regent of Kalba, and Khalid’s nephew, Kumaid, are constantly intriguing against him, but this is nor mal and their intrigues at present are not taking a very serious lorm. xiie income is about Rb.70,000/- a year which includes Rs.40,00$/. from Petroleum Concessions limited and Rs.25,000/- rom * t.e British oversees Airways Corporation. 7. Sharjah was once the most prosperous place on the Trucial ©oust but has decayed owing to the silting up of its creek and the mis-govemment of its rulers. The bazaar is still fairly extensive and well stockea. evening of the 19th April we visited Dubai, first / inspecting 1inspecting the aerodrome and the accommodation that is being erected lor the Royal Air Force, then visiting the bazaar and hospital ana finally dining with the Shaikh* 9. Work on the aerodrome is proceeding apace but the construction of the buildings has onl^ just stalled* he Jh&amp;ikh is affording all facilitiefc. 10* The bazaars are thronged and the creek full oi era! t and the whole place ha® an air of vigour and prosperity which 1 have not seen elsewhere in the uulf. The shop-keepers ere mostly Persians but there are also a number of Hindus, Khojas and haharanas* The only persons i sa» in huropean cress were the vana&amp;er of kessrs* Gray Mackenzie 3c Co*, ai^i the lost/li&amp;sier, who is a huhaamacan from Sind* The warehouses are full of goods and business is obviously flourishing* The Post Office which the Posts and Telegraphs Lepartment of the Government of India thought would not pay was only opened on April 1st aid by the Ibth had already more than covered the whole of its expenses for t:ie month* i;ub&amp; 1' s prosperity is cue partly to the silting up of the Sha.rjah creek anc partly to the exactions of the Persian CustooiS authori ties at Lingah, Bandar Abbas and other places. Persian merchants have transferred their wholesale business to Lubai which is now an entrepot not only for the Trucial Coast and its hinterland but also ior the Persian coast opposite it. 11. Shaikh Csid bin tfaktum like the Shaikh of *bu T. kabi belongs to the beni fas. He is a wise old r. r **n, whose private life has been exemplary, and is much respected. He has a very competent son called Rashid to succe d him. He appears to control the large population of Bubai very efficiently in a patriarchal manner with a few armed retainers. K is income is about 3 lakhs a year of which as.30,000/- cores from letroleum Concessions Limited anc about lk,00c/- from the British Overseas Airways Corporation, ttu bulk of the remainder bein^ derived from / CustomsCustoniB. Hie brother. Shaikh %*ucja f is a prondnent personality. He is a t&gt;reat talker ana somewhat of a buf foon. A fee years a^o he playfully seared the eyes of Home enemies of his brother eith a red hot iron} but this was done so hurriedly and so lightly that ail but one of those concerned have recovered their sight. Shaikh Said’s enemies have noe mostly betn scattered but f the Shaikh of Sharjah is extremely envious of him and loses no opportunity of intriguing against him. 12. The Shaikh gave us an excellent dinner to ehicn he also invitee the local C^adi and other leading inhabitants of Lubai* After dinner *r. Bertram Thomas showed some of his propaganda films which were most enthusiastically received. 13 # un the morning of the 20th April i flew to Kalba where 1 was met by the Regent, Shaikh Khalid. The actual Shaikh, Said bin Ahmad, is a boy of 12 who is living withhis cousin, Humaid (see paragraph 6 above) at Dubai and going to scnool there, a met him there the previous evening, he is an intelligent and good-looking boy with a very dark cooqplexion and round rather Dravidian looking features, shaikh hhalid who has been looked upon ratner as the stormy petrel of the Trucial Coast is now very old, b t his brain did not appear to me to have lost its cunning. He cs ^e out to meet m at the landing ground accompanied by a fairly large retinue and conducted me to his house where he gave me a oreaxfast which woulo have been excellent but for the swarms of flies it attracted. The people of Kalb© appear to depend almost entirely for their livelihood on their fairly extensive date gardens and fish and take little interest in the outside world. The heat there was very great even at 8 a.m. 14# 1 returned from R&amp;iba to Sharjah by car and we then set out by road for Has al Ahaiu*ah* un t e way we visited Ajman, Hamriyah anc umm-al-^awain • lb* Ajiiian is a tiny bhaikhdom and its ruler is Rashid bin Humaid of the Beni tta*im who has no influence outside the town. / His-5- (9 7i&gt; 1UB income i» little more than the Ke.6,000/- per annum which h . r , ceiYeB from Petroleum ConceeeionB Limits.

(b) The Shaikh should of course pay his call on steamer. (c) I see the Regulations prescribe levee dress so I will wear this and not undress as originally stated. A Guard of Honour should be provided which I will inspect on landing. (d) I will return Shaikh's call immediately after inspecting Guard of Honour.

He will also arrange for a speci barge to be brought over to take the Resident’s car day before the Resident himself leaves Bahrain. He will consult Mr. Davies ■tfeto-J^.nager of A.A.O.C. with regard to the provision of guides and escort through the sandy patches in the neighbourhood of Jubail. He informed me that the Aoifram-al-Kabrit drilling has been abandoned after reaching 10,400 feet without 5 A&lt; /lu^ s^htd^j^-oil and that the camp has been closed so that if the Resident is to spend two days on the journey it will probably be better for him to stay at Abu Haderia. 2.

A. d Mr. Davids informed Mr. Rodstrom that he thought t that it would be difficult if not impossible for the Resident to get through the sand between Dhahran and Abu Hadriyah with small tyres. He has stated that there are sand patches 35 kilometres north of Jhahran and again in the neighbourhood of Jubail. Unfortunately the camps at Abu Hadriyah and Juf have been closed down but accommo dation will be available for the Resident. Mr. davits has agreed to send a lighter for the Resident’s motor car and suggests that someone must be deputed to travel with the vehicle to ensure that no damage is done. He is unfortunately unable to provide a guide but there is no doubt that Abdullah al Fadhal will be able to do so. /* |</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002e3_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/500</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002e3</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/500</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 12/10 Tours of the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1935/1945</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-03-27T00:21:14</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (239 folios)</extent><extent>The papers in the file are arranged chronologically.
