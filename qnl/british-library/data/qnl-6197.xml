T HESE Volumes contain all the information I have been able to collect concerning the British Enactments in force in the Native States in India. 1 2. The term “ British Enactments,” as used in these volumes, includes— (I) the Enactments made by the British Legislature in exercise of the general jurisdiction which it possesses over its subjects and servants in all Native States, and (ii) the Enactments made by or under the authority of the British Indian Executive Government in exer cise of the special jurisdiction which it has acquired, usually over all persons, in certain Native States or places therein. 3. 2 The distinction between these two classes of Enactments has been observed in classifying the British Enactments in force in the Native States dealt with in these volumes, the Enactments in force in each local area having been placed under separate heads according as they belong to one or other of these classes. Enactments which purport to be solely made under the authority of the Legislature, or which appear to be limited to the classes of persons with which the Legislature can deal, have been arranged under one head and styled “ British-Indian Enactments whilst Enactments which purport to be made, in whole or in part, under the special authority of the Executive Government above de scribed, or which do not appear to be limited to the classes of 1 i.e., the territories of any Native Prince or Chief under the suzerainty of Her Majesty exercised through the Governor-General of India, or through any Governor or other officer subor dinate to the Governor-General of India —see 52 and 53 Viet., cap. 63, s. 18 (5). 2 There are certain exceptions to the general rules laid down in this paragraph, which are poticed in the body of the Lists. [ Hi ] lpersons with which the Legislature can deal, have been arranged under a different head, haying as its title the name of the parti cular place for which the Enactments have been made with the word “ British ” prefixed. Broadly speaking, the “ British- Indian Enactments ” are personal laws applicable only to British subjects or servants, whilst the other Enactments are territorial laws applicable to all persons in the particular places to which they respectively refer. 4. The minor classification under each of these heads is identical, the Enactments being arranged, as far as possible, in separate lists, as they are of the nature of— (1) Principal Enactments, that is, Enactments made under the immediate authority of the Legislature or the Executive Government, consisting of— A.—Enactments of the Legislature — [а) Statutes, (б) Acts of the Governor-General in Council 1 ; L.—Enactments of the Executive Government — (a) Enactments of the British-Indian Legis latures applied, (&amp;) Special Laws; or (2) Subordinate Enactments, that is, Enactments (Buies and Orders) made under authority conferred in this behalf by Principal Enactments. 5. “ Special Laws ” are new laws made by the Executive Government for places in which it has acquired special jurisdic tion, while “ Enactments of the British-Indian Legislatures 1 Strictly speaking, all the Enactments of the Legislatures established in this country are Subordinate Enactments, inasmuch as the Indian Legislatures derive their authority solely from Parliamentary Enactments; but for the purposes of these Lists, Acts of the Governor-General in Council are classified as on the same footing with Statutes.[ V ] applied” are, as their title indicates, existing British-Indian Enactments which have, by order of the Executive Government, been adopted, usually with certain modifications, as laws in such places. Though there is no material distinction between these two kinds of Enactments, it has been found convenient to arrange them in separate groups in these volumes. 6. A general classification of the British Enactments which may be made for the Native States in India, and a detailed classification of the various British Enactments actually in force in the Native States dealt with in each volume, which have been prepared in accordance with the above remarks, will be found m Statements Nos. I and II, prefixed to these volumes (pages xi and xii). 7. The Enactments which the various Native States may have made for their respective territories are beyond the scope of this work. 8. Eor the convenience of local officers, each volume contains (see Part I) the British Enactments in force generally in all Native States in India, as well as the Enactments in force locally in the particular Native States with which it deals. 9. Numerous references to Aitchison s Treaties have been inserted, which will, it is hoped, add to the usefulness of these Lists. The revised edition of 1876 is the one referred to. 10. A short alphabetical index of names of places has been appended for convenience of reference. 11. In compiling the volumes— («) Buies and Orders of a temporary nature or conferring powers on persons by name have, as a rule, been omitted; and (b) Special Laws and Subordinate Enactments, which are not to be found in the Codes published by the Legislative Department, have, as a rule, been set out in extenso. 12. Mr. G. B. Bidge of the Legislative Department Office has assisted me in the preparation of these Lists, and Mr. E. G.C vi ] “Wigley, the Officiating Under Secretary, has kindly undertaken to supervise the passing of the final proof through the Press and the insertion of such Enactments as may he issued after this date. 13. Lastly, it must he stated that these volumes are not authori tative, and that the Government of India is in no way responsible for their contents. They have been compiled by me from the Offi cial Gazettes, supplemented by local information obtained through the Eoreign Department. Though I have made them as complete and accurate as was possible, having regard to the materials at my disposal and the limited time which I have been at liberty to devote to the work, I am fully conscious of their many defects. At the same time I hope that, notwithstanding their imperfections, the volumes will be found to be of some practical value to Political Officers and others desirous of obtaining information concerning the British Enactments in force in the Native States in India. * J. M. MACPHEESON. Simla ; The 27th October 1890. In his recent valuable work, “ The Protected Native States of India,” Mr. Lee-Warner states (see page 366) that if the reader “ refers to the official Gazettes of the Indian Government he will find many scores of pages devoted annually to the judicial noti fications published by the political offices of the Empire. The law relating to the Native States fills thousands of pages.” The object of the work now being brought to completion has been to save the labour and trouble involved in referring to the official Gazettes for these Notifications by supplying information in a classified form as to their contents. Though the work only professes to contain lists of the Notifications in question, it will be found on examination that, except in the case of the two first volumes, which do not, as a rule, reproduce the subordinate Enactments, the whole of each Notification referred to in these volumes is set out in extenso either in the last column of theLists or in the appendices, so that a reference to the Gazettes, even for the purpose of ascertaining the exact words of a Notifica tion, has been rendered unnecessary. Indeed, if used in conjunc tion with the “ Codes” published by the Legislative Department, which contain the Statutes, Acts, and Regulations mentioned in the Lists, these volumes ought to form a fairly complete handbook to the British Enactments now in force in the Native States of India. The subject of the relations between the British Government and the Native States of India has of late been brought before the public not only in Mr. Lee-Warner’s work above mentioned, but also in Mr. Tupper’s no less valuable work, “Our Indian Protectorate.” In both these volumes these relations have been treated of chiefly from a politico-historical point of view. In his earlier work, entitled “ A Collection of Treaties, Engagements, and Sanads relating to India and neighbouring countries,” of which a revised edition has recently been published, Sir Charles Aitchison dealt very fully and comprehensively with the same subject, mainly from the standpoint of our contractual relations towards these States. In these and the previous volumes of this work an attempt has been made to approach this subject from what may be described as its legal or jurisdictional aspect, the object being to show the extent to which British-made law applies to these Native States, and, though these volumes are practically little more than compilations of information which is available to any one who chooses to study the Gazettes, they will perhaps help to throw light on what has hitherto been a somewhat confusing branch of the subject. Simla ; TAe 1st January 1895. J. M. MACPHERSON.PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. I N preparing for publication the second edition of this work one important alteration has been introduced which, it is hoped, will render it more useful for purposes of reference. In the first edition the Enactments were merely summarized and ~ included in the lists, with the exception of certain special ones, which were reproduced in extenso in Appendices: in the present edition, however, all Enactments which have been issued by the Government of India have been reproduced in extenso, except in so far as they are to be found in the volumes of General Acts of the Governor-General in Council, or in one of the Provincial Codes. In such cases full references are given: and the chrono logical lists which formed the basis of the first edition are only retained in a simplified form to serve the purposes of a table or index. In its present form it is hoped that the work may be regarded as a not inadequate supplement to the General Acts of the Governor-General in Council and the Provincial Codes. 2. A general nominal index has been added at the end of the sixth Volume (the Western Indian Volume) for facility of reference. 3. Mr. Macpherson, the Secretary to the Government of India in the Legislative Department, who compiled the first edition, has kindly permitted me to consult him in matters regarding the general scheme of the work, and I have to express my obligations to him for his advice. I have also had the assistance of Mr. Pidge of the Legislative Department Office, who has been most useful in helping to prepare the volumes for Press. A. WILLIAMS. Simla ; The 15th September 1899. C ix ]d&gt; PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION. FN this, the third, edition of “ British Enactments in force in Native States,” the system of arrangement has been altered from that adopted by Mr. (now Sir John) Macpherson in the first edition. States in relation with the Government of India, with the Administered Areas situated in them, have been grouped (Volumes I-III) apart from those in relation with Local Govern ments (Volume IV), while one Volume (V) is devoted to Railways wherever situated. Again orders under Acts applied and under Local Laws have been separated from the rest of the enactments, and form Volumes II and III in the case of the first group of States, and Part II of Volume IV in the case of the second group, and Part II of Volume V in the case of railways. Lastly, for convenience of reference, orders relating to Courts have been entered under a separate sub-head in each chapter in Volumes I, IV, Part I, and V, Part I. In the Appendices have been collected all orders to which there are constant references in the body of the work, or which it is convenient to group together for pur poses of comparison, such as on ers relating to the appointment of Justices of the Peace, of Marriage Registrars, and of Registrars of Births and Deaths. Each Volume states the law as in force on the 19th April 1913. O V. BOSANQUET. Simla ; The 24th April 1913.VOLUME V. PART I. RAILWAYS IN NATIVE STATES. For purposes of jurisdiction, railways in Native States can be divided into three classes, namely, those on which the Darbars concerned have ceded full sovereignty to the British Government, those on which they have ceded jurisdiction 1 only, and those on which they retain both sovereignty and jurisdiction. The first class consists (with one 2 exception) of main lines planned previously to 1864 when that form of cession was relinquished : the second of main lines built since that, date: and the third of local lines, situated as a rule in one State only. The lands of the first class are British territory to which the laws of British India extend as such: those of the second class, while remaining Native State territory are Administered Areas for which jurisdictional arrangements have been made as detailed in this Part; while those of the third class are integral portions of the States in which they are situated and the only British enactments 3 in force are those which operate in those States as shown in Volume I or Volume IV as the case may be. Geographically, the lines can be grouped in the following divisions :— Eastern Division. LINES ON WHICH DARBARS HAVE CEDED FULL SOVEREIGNTY. Lines on which Darbars have ceded jurisdiction only.

When the Bareilly-Rampur-Moradabad chord of this Railway was undertaken in 1892, the State ceded jurisdiction, the exercise of which is'®ow provided for by notification No. 1947-I.B., dated the 16th September 1912, printed infra p. 11. 2 Proclamations No. 1335-J.

Any medical officer or qualified medical practitioner may, at any railway station in the Central India Agency, compel any person or all the persons in any train stopping at such station to alight from that train and undergo such inspection of body or property as the said medical officer or the said qualified medical practitioner may consider necessary for determining whether the said person or persons travelling by train is or are suffering from or is or are likely to be infected with bubonic fever or plague. 2. If any such traveller is found to be so suffering, or if the aforesaid inspection shows that he is likely to be infected with bubonic fever, it shall be competent for the person making the inspection to direct the removal, 1 1 These rules are applied from time to time to stations by separate notification as occasion requires.

It is obligatory on every traveller referred to in any of the fore going sections to answer all questions put to him by the person making such inspection or in medical charge of the traveller, and such traveller is bound to answer any such question fully and truthfully to the best of his information, knowledge and belief. 5. Any person taking action under any of the foregoing sections without authority from his official superior or from some officer of Government shall not be entitled to protection under section 4 of Act III of 1897,^ but such authority mav be given by the Local Government indicated in Foreign Department notification 1 No. 443-1.A., dated 4th February 1897, subsequently to such action being taken. 6 . Any action such as is contemplated in the first three sections of these regulations which may have been taken before these regulations come into force shall be held to have been taken under these regulations. 7.

Home Department notifica tion No. 834, dated the 6th March 1897. 1 See footnote 2 on page 153, supra.155 and examination of travellers by Railway in Rajputana, is in the hands of the Residency Surgeon and Chief Medical Officer in Rajputana, under the control of, and subject to report to, the Agent to the Governor General in Rajputana and Chief Commissoner, Ajmer-Merwara. 2 . Under the direction of the Commissioner, the Assistant Commis sioners, Ajmer and Merwara, and the Cantonment Magistrates, Nasirabad and Deoli, are generally responsible for the plague arrangements of their respective Districts and Cantonments. An Assistant Commissioner or Cantonment Magistrate may, within the limits of his jurisdiction, issue such orders as may appear necessary; provided that they do not conflict with the general principles of these rules, and that an immediate report is made to the head of the department concerned in any important case in which such order affects any officer not immediately subordinate to him. 3. Subject to the general control of the Commissioner, the Civil Surgeon of Ajmer, as Chief Health Officer of the District, is directly responsible for the conduct of plague arrangements. He is Inspecting Medical Officer in respect of the arrangements relating to travellers by railway within the limits of the district. Within the limits of the Nasirabad and Deoli Cantonments the conduct of plague arrangements rests with the Staff Surgeon, Nasirabad, and the Agency Surgeon, Deoli, respectively. 4. The term u Medical Officer in these rules means and includes (а) the Civil Surgeon, Ajmer, the Staff Surgeon, Nasirabad, the Agency Surgeon, Deoli, the Assistant Surgeon, Beawar; ( б ) a Plague Inspecting Medical Officer at a Railway Inspecting Station, who is a Medical Officer appointed for the examina tion of xailway passengers and connected precautions against the importation of plague; (c) any other person appointed by the Agent to the Governor General in Rajputana, and Chief Commissioner, Ajmer-Merwara, to be a Medical Officer for the purposes of these rules. 5. The term “ Medical Assistant ” includes all other medical practi tioners in Government employ. 6 . All the above officers are invested with powers to enforce the rules made by the Government of India and the Agent to the Governor General Rajputana, and Chief Commissioner, Ajmer-Merwara, under the Epidemic Diseases Act, and to issue such orders in any particular case as may be necessary for the carrying out of these rules.156 7. Every effort must be made to enlist the services of influential non* official representatives of the native community. It is not only in the actual carrying out of plague measures but in the discussion of what measures ought to be taken that their co-operation is required. Such discussion must, if the choice of members has been judicious, tend greatly to lesson the risk of popular misunderstanding. At the same time it affords an opportunity for explanation to the authorities of difficulties in the way of proposed action which might not otherwise be foreseen. When a particular line of action has once been adopted, it is most undesirable that there should be any hesita tion in pursuing it, or any drawing back. The best means of avoiding such contingencies is to be found in the real and practical, not merely nominal,, association of natives of ability and standing with the work of officials. 8 . Any orders issued or action taken of special importance or general application by any person exercising authority under these rules shall be immediately reported to the Residency Surgeon and Chief Medical Officer in Rajputana, and the Agent to the Governor General in Rajputana, and Chief Commissioner, Ajmer-Merwara. 9. Any general orders issued by the Residency Surgeon and Chief Medical Officer in Rajputana to the Civil Surgeon of Ajmer in connection with plague operations shall be forwarded through the Commissioner, and a copy shall at the same time be sent to the Chief Commissioner. 10. All expenses incurred in carrying out these rules shall, in the first instance, be paid in the case of Ajmer-Merwara, if in a Municipality or Cantonment, from the Municipal or Cantonment Fund, otherwise from the District Fund or from any general allotment or special grant made for the purpose by the Government of India. In the case of railway lands in Native States, either by the Darbar concerned or from any special fund or allotment to which the amount may, by order, be made debitable. PART II.

The Pailway Surgeon and Chief Medical Officer in Rajputana will supply to all officers concerned a list of the areas which may from time to time be declared infected^ and also notify all changes which may from time to time be made in such list. 13. Every train coming from the direction of any area which may be notified from-time to time as infected for the purpose of this rule shall be detained at the abovenamed stations so long as may be necessary for the medical examination of the passengers. The railway authorities shall detain fhe train so long as the Medical Officer may consider necessary for the purpose. On the arrival of the train at these stations, no passenger shall alight from the train without the permission of a Railway Police or Medical Official. 14. Every passenger shall, on being requested to do so, by any Rail way Police or Medical Official, alight from the train, and proceed for the purpose of medical inspection to any spot that may be indicated by such official. 15. A passenger shall not depart from the spot so indicated without the permission of the Medical Officer. 16. The examination of females shall be effected under the orders of the Medical Officer by women only. 17.

Passengers who have travelled in the same compartment as the patient shall be detained for observation in a segregation hut or tent (other than the observation shed provided under rule 18, or the hospital established under the first paragraph of this rule) until the Medical Officer considers it safe to allow them to proceed on their journey : provided that when plague is indigenous and well-established in a place it will no longer be necessary to enforce the detention of persons found travelling in the same railway carriage with General and Chief Commissioner, the Medical Officer has authority to detain any passenger who after a summary medical examination is found to be158 i suffering from any suspicious symptoms. The Medical Officer shall remove any person so detained to the observation shed erected in the vicinity of the trail railway station, and shall arrange for the detention, dieting and medical pun treatment of such person in the observation shed for so long as he (the Medical Officer) may consider necessary. ^ 19. If, in any case, a person removed to a temporary hospital is accom- ofik panied by a companion or attendant, the Medical Officer shall require such tk companion or attendant to live in the immediate neighbourhood of the tern- mis porary hospital in a segregation hut or tent provided for the purpose, and to me remain in such place until he receives permission from the Medical Officer to depart. ^ 20. If a person is attacked with plague while so segregated, the Medical Mi Officer shall remove such person to the temporary hospital, and shall keep M under observation in a segregation hut, tent or other suitable structure for Of a period of ten days from the date of such removal, any companion or attendant ski who has been with such person. on 21. Upon the death of the sick person the Medical Officer shall, for the ten days immediately following, detain under observation all persons who have been in attendance on him, in segregation huts, tents, or other suitable structures established for the purpose in the neighbourhood. \ 22. A person dealt with under the foregoing rules shall comply with any d directions that may be given to him by the Medical Officer with regard to ^ his removal to, and his detention and treatment in, an observation shed, 1 temporary hospital, or place of segregation, and with respect to the disinfect- i ing or burning of his personal effects, or with respect to the disposal of any c corpse, or any other similar matters : he shall not depart from any such place s. of detention without the permission of the Medical Officer. p 23. The luggage and clothing of passengers detained under rules 18 and f 20 (travelling from areas in which the plague prevails) shall be disinfected in a a^cc rdance with Annexure I; or, instead of articles being boiled, they may v be steeped in a solution of perchloride of mercury and sun-dried. ‘ 24. Except as provided for above, the persons and personal effects of passengers are on no account to be disinfected, whether they come from an infected area or not. ^ 25. In cases where it is considered necessary that the clothes or bedding, etc., of a traveller should be burnt, the Medical Officer may, if the person is poor or for other sufficient reason, arrange for providing other articles in their place at the expense of Government, or for payment of compensation159 26. Persons other than those mentioned above, who alight from the train, and who come from an infected area, as denoted by their having punch-marked tickets, shall be brought under surveillance. In Ajmer-Merwera their names and addresses will be recorded by the Railway Police and communicated to District Superintendent of Police and officer in charge of Police Station of the circle, who will arrange to have their health enquired into daily for ten days, reporting at once to the Com missioner and District Magistrate, and if in Cantonments, to the Canton ment Magistrate, the development of any suspicious symptoms. Elsewhere, their names and addresses shall be ascertained, and they shall be ordered to report themselves daily for ten days to such officer as the Medical Officer under the instructions of the Residency Surgeon and Chief Medical Officer may direct. The officer will be furnished by the Medical Officer with a daily list of persons ordered to report themselves to him. He shall record in a register the daily attendance of such persons, and shall at once bring any case of failure to attend to the notice of the Resident or Poli tical Agent concerned, who shall thereupon take necessary action to have the case promptly investigated. 27. Railway Police and Station Masters, at places where there is no Inspecting Officer, will watch trains and persons who alight, and in case of discovering cases of plague or dangerous symptoms amongst the passengers will allow them to proceed to the nearest station where there is a Medical Officer, and communicate,with the latter by telegraph, Corpses discovered in the train or near the line should be at once removed and kept apart in a convenient place, until they have been inspected by a Medical Officer, who should be telegraphed for for that purpose, and who will arrange for the proper disposal of the body. In the case of a European or Muhammadan, the body shall be buried at least six feet deep ; the place of burial, if not an authorized cemetery, should be well away from habitations and sources of water-supply. In the case of a Hindu, the body shall be completely and thoroughly burnt in an isolated locality in the presence of a responsible official. 2S. Every case ef suspected plague or of a death occurring in a case where the existence of plague was known or suspected, or of a corpse being found in a train, shall be telegraphed urgent and direct by the Medical Officer, Railway Police, or Station Master, to whose knowledge it comes, to the First Assistant to the Agent to the Governor General, and the Residency Surgeon and Chief Medical Officer, and also, in Ajmer-Merwara, to the Com missioner, and to the Magistrate of the District in which the case occurs, and^ Not reprinted. in the Native States, to the Resident or Political Agent, and the Residency or Agency Surgeon. 29. Cases of persons alighting and re-booking to avoid plague measures will be reported by telegraph by the Station Master or Railway Police to the Medical Officer or Railway Police of the Station to which the last booking is made, who will bring them under surveillance as in rule 26 above. 30. The importation into Ajmer-Merwara or to Railway lands in Rajputana of used apparel and bedding (except personal baggage), rags, and waste papers from infected areas, is forbidden. 31. It is imperative that Railway vehicles in which suspected or declared cases of plague have occurred should be stopped at and not allowed to run further than either the station at which such cases are removed from the carriage or the nearest medical inspection station ; and that such vehicles shall be disinfected in accordance with the instructions contained in Annexure III.* PART III. Rules relating to Municipal Towns and Cantonments. (1) Preventive Action. 32. The employment of volunteer agency for discovering cases of plague is to be resorted to as far as possible, though caution must be used in the accept ance of the result arrived at by it. Owners and occupiers of houses, resident heads of families, employers of factory labour, and medical practitioners should be encouraged to bring to the notice of the authorities cases of suspected plague and the arrival of persons from an infected area. In towns the practice of dividing into circles or wards and of arranging for the working in each of prominent inhabitants of that quarter as volunteers may, as a rule, usefully be adopted. House-holders and medical practitioners will sometimes give to such persons information which they would hesitate to communicate to a Gov ernment official. The case of employers of factory labour is different. It mav often be found more convenient for them to work directly with the auth orities. Compulsory notification is not to be enforced, but voluntary notifica tion must in every possible way be encouraged. Where volunteer agency is available, it must not be allowed to work spasmodically ; on the contrary, it is of the first importance that arrangements should be made for its systematic employment. 33. Por the purpose of ^checking the occurrence of deaths, the Assistant Commissioner or Cantonment Magistrate may post Police Officers or other161 officials at burial and burning grounds. Such officials may enquire of the mourners the place and the cause of death, but shall not delay or interfere with the cremation or burial in any way. Compulsory corpse inspection by Medical Officers should not be resorted to; but during an outbreak of plague all deaths, the cause of which cannot be determined not to be plague, should be treated as deaths from plague. It will be open to any persons to voluntarily submit a dead body to the examination of a Medical Officer if they wish to avoid ihe death being treated as due to plague. 34. The Civil Surgeon, or authorised Medical Officer shall issue to th e owner and occupier of a house such instructions as he may consider necessary with regard to the disinfection and cleaning of the buildings, the disinfection or destruction of personal effects, the disposal of any corpses, the improvement of the sanitary condition of the premises, and with regard to other similar matters. Where such instructions are in writing a copy of them should be sent to the Assistant Commissioner. The Medical Officer shall, if he consi ders it necessary, himself take measures for the disinfection of a house and for the other matters referred to in this rule. 35. When plague appears ia a town or cantonment as a first or fresh infec' tion, and before it is believed to have obtained a footing, the owner and occupier of any house shall permit the Medical Officer to enter his premises and examine any person whom he has reason to suspect to be infected with the disease. If the person be a female, the examination shall be made by a female Hospital Assistant or other female agency. 36. If, under the above circumstances, on examination of any person the Medical Officer suspects that such persons is suffering from, or infected with plague, he may cause such person to be removed to a hospital, and may arrange for his detention, dieting, and medical treatment therein : provided that no person in a moribund condition shall be removed to hospital, save at the express wish of the friends of the patient. He may also cause the other occu pants of the house in which such person resides to be removed to a segregation camp, and to be detained under observation for ten days : provided that any member of the family of the person so removed, who wishes to accompany him to the hospital, shall be allowed to do so. Instead of causing the occupants to be so removed the Medical Officer may direct any or all of them to present himself or themselves daily for in spection for the next ten days at any place or before any officer named by him. Any person to whom such an order is given shall be bound to obey it. 37. When plague has obtained a thorough footing, or is believed to be a recrudescence of a previous outbreak, the measures prescribed in rules 35 and 36 are not to be carried out compulsorily, although every effort should be V ISHHHMMU I tuttm 162 made to induce the persons concerned to submit to them as likely to he attended with partial, if not complete, beneficial effect. (£) Action to be taken when an outbreak of 'plague has occurred or is likely to occur. 38. When there is reason to believe that cases of plague are occurring in a town, or are bkely to occur owing to its proximity to an infected area* the town should be divided into quarters or circles of a size convenient for effective supervision, and each quarter should be placed, as far as possible, under the charge of an European official, to be called the Superintendent, who may be a Civil officer taken from any department, a Military or a Medical Officer according to circumstances. 39. The quarter under each officer should be sub-divided into defined areas, which may consist of a street, a portion of a street or group of houses and each of these sub-divisions should be placed under the charge of a district or local subordinate, who will be called a supervisor. With each supervisor will be associated one or more residents of the sub-division, who will assist the Supervisor in obtaining information regarding sickness and mortality in the areas respectively allotted to him. Under each Supervisor will be a gang of coolies, varying in numbers to suit the requirements of each locality. 40. While the use of search parties, paid spies and informers is prohibited the system of house-to-house visitation, with the object of discovering cases of plague, by Medical Officers or subordinates is not open to objection, provided the measure is carried out with tact and discretion. Such discretion may find expression in one way among others in consultation with ward members and other influential residents. Either they should, wherever possible, be associated in the task, or, as may in some cases be expedient, the duty may be entirely committed to them. House-to-house visitation is one of the matters in regard to which the exercise of tact is eminently necessary. It should be clearly understood that on no account should any house be entered without the consent of the occupiers, except in the particular circumstances referred to in rule 35. 41. As a sound system of surveillance is one of the most useful means of preventing a healthy place from becoming infected, people should be encour aged everywhere to carry out the work themselves, but the exact methods to be adopted will be determined by the authorities on the spot, with reference to local conditions and the resources at their disposal. 42. The Superintendent should be provided with a suitable office in his own circle, where he should remain the whole day, except at intervals for meals, The office will be his head-quarters, to which all communicationsshould be sent and at which the supervisors will make their daily reports. He will exercise a general supervison over all the operations and will issue orders for the necessary action to be taken by each section of the gang of coolies. 43. On a report being received by a Superintendent of the occurrence of a case of plague, he shall at once proceed to the house or other place where it is reported to have occurred. If the case is an undoubted case of plague, and is admitted to be such, he shall endeavour to arrange for the immediate removal of the patient to the Plague Hospital. If the case is of a suspicious nature, he shall at once send for a Medical Officer or Assistant, and shall endea vour to arrange for the removal of the patient either to a Plague Hospital or Plague Observation Ward according to the opinion formed of the case by the Medical Officer or Assistant. The removal of the patient to hospital or to an observation ward shall be compulsory only where it can be carried out so completely as to render it an effectual precaution, and in the case of persons with no one to look after them or no home. 44. The other occupants of the place where the persons suffering from plague or suspected of plague reside must not be compulsorily removed to a Segregation Camp, but if any such camp or any suitable place of segrega tion exists, they may be encouraged to go there. All such persons must be kept under observation as far as possible. Until the period of incuba tion has elapsed they are not to be detained, but arrangements must be made for maintaining a watch over them; and in the event of any such person moving to a place outside the circle of i the Superintendent to whom the case was reported, he must take every precaution to prevent his being lost sight of’ and for promptly communicating information regarding him to the authority into whose jurisdiction ho proceeds. The Superintendent may direct any such person to present himself daily for inspection for the next ten days at any place or before any officer named by him. Any person to whom such an order is given shall be bound to obey it. 45. No houses vacated on account of plague may be re-occupied without the Superintendents sanction, and he may cause a notice to that effect to be affixed to each vacated house. He should place a seal on boxes containing valuable property left in houses which have been evacuated on account of plague. Such property may be removed by the owner, but if he declines to remove it, it will remain at his risk. Property of any value belonging to the poorer classes which it may be considered necessary or advisable to destrov as being infected, should be appraised by two or more respectable natives, and the value paid to the owner by the Superintendent of the Circle. Compensa-f tion should also be given without delay to the very poor for the destruction o V 124164 w clothes, etc., which, although they may be of no market value, yet serve a useful purpose to the owners. 46. Each Supervisor shall keep a list of all residents in each house in his sub-division. He shall inspect all new arrivalsjand shall obtain information from them as to their previous place oi residence. He shall associate in his work as intimately as possible ward members or other respectable inhabitants of his sub-division. He should, in company with one or more of the local residents associated with him, visit all the houses in his sub division, and obtain information regarding the health of the different inmates, and shall, on the conclusion of his rounds, report verbally to his Superinten dent the occurrence of all cases of sickness and death, and any information regarding arrivals from infected localities. Any case of plague and all doubtful ones of sickness should be at once reported to the Superintendent at his office by day and at his house by night. The stock of disinfectants, padlocks and all surplus appliances for divisional use shall be kept in or near the office. 47. The inhabitants of an evacuated house should be allowed to remove sufficient grain for their personal consumption after it has been exposed to the sunlight so as to remove all danger of infection. If in any case it is desired to remove grain for sale from an infected area, it must first be spread out, under the direction of the Superintendent, and exposed to air and sun light for 4S hours. In neither case must bags or sacks be removed until they have been boiled or disinfected and sun-dried. 48. After evacuation of a house under rules 35 and 37, the walls and floors of all rooms with their contents except articles of food which it is not intended to destroy, and of all enclosures, should be disinfected in the manner indicated in Annexure I.* All rags and refuse found in the house or enclosure should be burned in the presence of the Supervisor. It is often prudent to disinfect not only one house in which a case of sickness has occurred or dead rats have been found, but those in the immediate neighbourhood as well. Where the Superintendent thinks such disinfection advisable it should be carried out under his orders. 49. When disinfection by chemical agency cannot be carried out effec tively the roof, if not &amp;pakka one, should be removed, and holes should be made in the walls to admit freely air and light to the smaller rooms and enclosures. 50. The coolies engaged in the work of disinfection, etc., should be pro vided with boots or shoes, to protect their feet from the danger of infection through abraded surfaces. horn flag neig thal pni' the are vat tan tol sho un; tan the sho dire his tem ing on sue! bod deci Mu bur and com an Ma for pla pu * Not re-printed.* Not re-printed. 51. Experience has abundantly proved that the evacuation of an infected house or houses is seldom in itself sufficient to sta mp out the disease. When Plague manifests itself in one house in an indigenous form, those in the neigbourhood have, as a rule, already become infected, and it usually follows that cases subsequently appear in them. It is therefore always a wise and prudent course on the occurrence of an indigenous case, to evacuate not only the one house, but also all those in the immediate neighbourhood. 52. It may be advisable owing to the occurrence of several cases in one area, and while there is still some hope of stamping out the outbreak to vacate a group of houses or a whole sub-division, and to segregate the inhabi tants. The whole or any portion of the population vacating may be removed to the segregation camp, but ordinarily inhabitants of non-infected house 8 should be allowed the option of going where they please. Disinfection and umoofing of the houses should then be carried out in due course. o3. On the evacuation of the houses iu the infected area, all the inhabi tants of the non-infected portion of the town should be encouraged to leave the town, and any obstacles which may tend to delay their departure should, if possible, be removed. 54. A person dealt with under the foregoing rules shall comply with and directions that may be given to him by the Medical Officer with regard to his removal to, and his detention and treatment in, an observation shed, temporary hospital or place of segregation, and with respect to the disinfect ing or burning of his clothing and personal effects, the disposal of any corpse or with respect to any other similar matter. He shall not depart from any such place of detention without the permission of the Medical Officer. 5o. In the event of a death occurring from plague, the disposal of the body shall be arranged for in accordance with t he religious practices of the deceased, and the instructions in Annexure I.* In the case of a Euorpean or Muhammadan, the body shall be buried at least six feet deep; the place of burial, if not an authorised cemetery, should be well away from habitations and sources of water-supply. In the case of a Hindu, the body shall be completely and thoroughly burned in an isolated locality in the presence of a responsible official. 56. The Assistant Commissioner of the District, or the Cantonment Magistrate, in the case of a Cantonment, shall provide suitable conveyances for the free carriage of persons suffering, or suspected to be suffering, from plague, and it shall be lawful to drive or carry such conveyances through any public or private thoroughfare.166 aftei 57. Any conveyance, public or private, used for the carriage of a person app® infected with plague or suspected of being infected, shall be thoroughly pro' disinfected and exposed to air and sunlight for seven days previous to being the' again brought into general use. and port (3) General Sanitary Precautions. ma; 58. In anv Municipality or Cantonment the Assistant Commissioner of any Magistrate authorised by him in this behalf, or the Cantonment Magis trate, may issue general orders that by a certain specified date certain sanitary precautions of a simple nature, such as the free ventilation and lime-washing of houses, cleaning of latrines, the removal of filth and rubbish and of parti tions which obstruct light and ventilation shall be carried out within any specified area, and all persons residing within such area shall be bound to give effect to these orders. 59 . If within such time such persons fail to carry out the operations specified in the notice the Medical Officer may, with the sanction of the Assistant Commissioner or of the Cantonment Magistrate, enter upon the premises at any time between sunrise and sunset, after giving such notice of his intention as shall under the circumstances appear to him to be reasonable, and carry out the measures specified above, provided that when an apartment is occupied by a female who, according to the customs of the country, does not appear in public, the Medical Officer shall give at least one houi s notice of his intention to enter such apartment and shall afford her every reasonable facilitv for withdrawing from such portion of the apartment as he may desire to enter. The expenses incurred may be recovered from the persons who in the opinion of the Assistant Commissioner or Cantonment Magistrate may fairly be held responsible. 60. When any premises or any block of huts are in such an insanitary state as, in the opinion of the Medical Officer, to make the inmates thereof specially liable to an attack of plague, he may require the owner by notice to have the whole or any portion of such premises cleansed within a specified time in such manner as may appear to him necessary, and may in consultation, if necessary, with a competent Engineer, direct the owner to remove all structures, partitions, erections or portions of house-walls which obstruct light and ventilation. If within such time the owner fails to carry out the operations specified in the notice, the Medical Officer may, with the sanction in writing of the Assistant Commissioner or of the Cantonment Magistrate, enter upon the premises at any time between sunrise and sunset,1 Not re-printed. 167 after giving- such notice of his intention as shall, under the circumstances, appear to him to be reasonable, and carry out the measures specitied above : provided that when an apartment is occupied by a female who, according to the customs of the country, does not appear in public, the Medical Officer shall give at least one hoar’s notice of his intention to enter such apartment and shall afford her every reasonable facility for withdrawing from such portion of the apartment as he may desire to enter. The expenses incurred may be recovered in the manner provided in rule 59 above. 61. In a town or place where cases of plague have occurred, all grain godowns or places where grain is stored or sold for consumption, shall be open at all times for inspection by the Medical Officer, or officer deputed by him. 62. When a grain godown is found improperly ventilated or in such an insanitary condition from damp or otherwise as to be unwholesome for storage of grain, the proprietor shall be required to remove the grain to a properly constructed godown. 63. All grain godowns in which dead rats have been found shall be declared unwholesome and unfit for use until thoroughly disinfected. The grain found in such godowns may be turned over and properly aired or destroyed as unfit for food, and any bags in which infected grain is found stored shall also be destroyed. 64. No person, except Municipal or Cantonment servants, shall pick up rags or other refuse in the streets or elsewhere. The Assistant Commissioner or Cantonment Magistrate may disinfect or, at his discretion, destroy any collection of rags in rag pickers’ houses or rag stores. PART IV. Rules relating to Non-Municipal Towns and Villages. 65. In villages and non-municipal towns it is the duty of every Patwarb Bhumia, Lambardar, Patel, Court of Wards Official, Kamdaror Havildar to at once report any suspected death or suspected case of plague to the nearest Police Station, and the Officer in charge of the Police Station on receiving report of a death, shall carefully inquire whether the deceased had symptoms of plague as described in 1 Annexure I. 66 . The Officer in charge of the Police Station shall report immediately to the Tahsildar, the District Superintendent of Police, the Assistant Com. missioner, the nearest Medical Subordinate and the Civil Surgeon, any case168 1 Not re-printed. of plague, actual or suspected, brought to his notice. The Civil Surgeon wil inform the Residency Surgeon and Chief Medical Officer and First Assistant to the Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner by telegram. 67. On receipt of a report of a case of plague from the police under the preceding rule, the Tahsildar, or, in his absence, the Naib Tahsildar, shall at once proceed to the spot, and if he finds that the death was due to plague, and that no other persons in the house in which the death occurred are ill, he shall proceed to dispose of the body (if not already disposed of), and to disinfect the house, clothes, and bedding of the deceased, as directed in 1 Annexure I, at the same time reporting the result of his inquiry to the Assistant Commis sioner. 68 . If he finds that any person in the house is ill with fever, he shall, with the assistance of the Lambardar or Patel of the village, in anticipation of orders from the Civil Surgeon or Assistant Commissioner, see that all the precautions specified in 1 Annexure I are rigorously observed. He will take similar action on learning of the occurrence of a case of plague at any wayside railway station in his Tahsil. 69. Officers of other Departments when_on tour shall, if they have reason to think that any case of plague has occurred, at once inform the Tahsildar, and send a copy of their report to the Assistant Commissioner. 70. The nearest Medical Subordinate to receive information of cases of plague from the Officer in charge of a Police Station will ordinarily be the Hospital Assistant of a Branch Dispensary. The Hospital Assistant on receiv ing a report of a case shall, if possible, at once visit the spot in co-operation with the Tahsildar, and see that the necessary sanitary measures are taken. He shall communicate the result forthwith to the Civil Surgeon. 71. In places in which a Branch Dispensary is situated, Hospital Assist ants shall themselves watch all arrivals and report sickness, with a description of the symptoms, to the Civil Surgeons of the district. The Officer in charge of the station in whose circle the dispensary is situated shall at once commu nicate to such Hospital Assistant all particulars received by him under rule 26. 72. The Civil Surgeon will arrange to proceed, as soon as possible, to places from which cases are reported. On arrival, the Civil Surgeon shall be guided in his action by the instructions in Part III and Part V, so far as they are applicable to the circumstances of the case. 7 3. Should the Civil Surgeon consider it necessary that the inhabitants of a village in which plague has broken out should temporarily camp out in the open or under trees at a distance from the village, he shall make a report169 to that effect to the Assistant Commissioner, and the ia,tter may direct the inhabitants to vacate their houses accordingly. The houses shall in this case be not again occupied till they are thoroughly ventilated and disinfected. 74. For the purpose of segregation, the Assistant Commissioner, or officer specially authorised by him in this behalf, may take possession of and occupy any vacant ground or building, such compensation being afterwards made to the owner or occupier thereof as may be fixed under rule 94 . 75. The Civil Surgeon may require any building to be vacated on suspicion of its being infected by plague, or on the ground of its being in a dangerously insanitary condition, and such building shall not be re-occupied without his permission. 76. In the case of villages badly infected, the whole of the inhabitants should be turned out. Villagers are accustomed to erecting shelters for themselves, but if necessary, materials for hutting should be supplied. The sick and suspected villagers should be carefully separated from the healthy, so far as is possible, without breaking up families, and an officer should be appointed to examine the daily health of the population and prevent migration to other villages. 77. A site for the hospital should be selected as near as possible to the infected population, but a permanent building, suitable in all respects for a hospital, may sometimes be obtained either inside or on the outskirts of the town. It can be easily disinfected when it is no longer required for a hospital, and such a building would be more popular and convenient than huts erected at a distance from the town. 78. If a suitable building is not available, it will be necessary to erect able mat screens should be provided between the beds to secure as much privacy as is possible to each patient. Every patient should be supplied with a cheap substitute for a spittoon, and both it and the vessels used as bed pans, should contain a sufficient quantity of an effective disinfecting solution. The floor of the hospital huts should be freely watered daily with the perchloride of mercury solution, and vessels containing the same solution should always be available for the disinfection of the hands and feet of the native attendants. PART V. Rules relating to Plague Hospitals and Camps. huts for plague patients, for convalescents, and for the observation of doubtful cases, on the nearest site. The hospital huts intended for females should be some distance apart from those intended for males. Move- 1 Not re-printed.79. Relations and friends of patients are to be permitted to attend upon them (so far as is consistent with the maintenance of discipline and order), and a stated time should be set apart for the visits of all other relatives and friends of the patients. 80. On the arrival of the patient at the hospital, all his clothing should be removed, and, if of little value, burnt in the presence of the Medical subor dinate ; otherwise they should be thoroughly disinfected. Hospital clothing should then be supplied. On recovery, the patient may be transferred to the convalescent ward or discharged. In either case, he should be given a warm bath and supplied with new clothes. 81. Huts for the segregation of individuals removed from infected houses and of all suspected persons should, if possible, be erected at a convenient distance from the hospital compound, and should be surrounded by a bamboo, or other fence. Individuals brought for admission into this camp may, if necessary, for the purpose of cleanliness, be bathed in a solution of carbolic ac pp^_ one to a hundred parts of water—and their clothing disinfected. 82 All the inmates should be inspected daily either by the Medical Officer or a Medical subordinate, and any case of plague detected should be removed at once to hospital, and doubtful cases of fever to the observation ward. If no case occurs amongst them after an interval of 15 to 80 days, they may be allowed to return to their houses, if such houses have been cleaned and disinfected, and if the local authority considers that they are fit for re-occupation, or be admitted into the camp for healthy individuals, after a second disinfection of theii clothing. 88 . Both the hospital compound and the segregation camp should be cruarded bv Police for the purpose of maintaining order and preserving o ^ property. 84. The establishment cf separate hospitals and segregation camps for the reception of private families or for members of special castes and religions should be encouraged, and every assistance should be given by the local authority for their erection and supervision. The treatment of the patients admitted into these hospitals may, if desired, be placed in the hands of vaids and hakims, and the internal management of both hospitals and camps may be conducted by members of the caste or religion concerned, subject, however, to the general supervision of a European doctor, in sanitary matters, where possible,°and control of the local authorities, and to the usual arrangements as regards guards. 85. If it is found that the healthy, i.e., people from houses not infected^ wish or are willing to vacate their homes, a separate camp for their accom modation should be arranged for. In this case, the inmates should be allowed1 Not re-printed. 171 to pursue their daily employments on condition that they sleep in camp, as a return to their own houses at night should render the effect of the voluntary evacuation futile. The huts should be numbered, inmates registered and a daily inspection made of all the residents, if no case of plague has occurred in a hut for 15 to 30 days, the inmates may be allowed to return to their houses, if such houses have been ventilated and cleaned, and if the local authority considers that they are fit for re-occupation. 86. Should a case of plague occur in a hut, the patient should be re moved to hospital, and the other inmates to the segregation camp. The hut should be at once burned and the site disinfected with the perchloride of mercury solution. 87. The method of arranging a plague camp is given in Annexure II 1 to these rules. 88. The Commissioner may close a private hospital if it appears to him that the management of such hospital is not satisfactory. 89. Every effort should be made to render plague camps and hospitals as attractive as possible, by studying the comfort and meeting the reasonable wants of the inmates, in order to induce the people to resort to them voluntarily. To this end the establishment of private and caste hospitals is to be encouraged : hospitals shoul 1 be located near infected quarters : the size of hospitals should be limited so that patients may receive sufficient indivi dual attention and accommodation may be readily made available for their families and friends. Care must be taken to provide an adequate number of medical attendants and nurses : ample and comfortable accommodation is to be set apart for patients, and at least two friends should be permitted to be in attendance on each patient, so that no patient who has friends willing to attend him need ever be left alone. PART VI. Miscellaneous. Inoculation. 90. On an outbreak of plague occurring the Residency Surgeon and Chief Medical Officer should at once place himself in communication with the Officer in charge of the Plague Research Laboratory in Bombay, with a view to obtaining a supply of lymph and syringes for inoculation, and instruc tions for their use. Inoculation should then be started under the personal supervision of the Civil Surgeon or a trained medical subordinate, and inocula-tion certificates granted, free charge, to all who voluntarily undergo the process. 91. No person shall be inoculated without his own express consent, but it is highly desirable that all officials, European and Native, leaders of Native Society and employers of labour should do all in their power by precept and example to render the measure popular, and to overcome any prejudice that research and experiment, it is that Haffkine-’s inoculation confers a very sensible, although not absolute, protection against attack, with a diminished case mortality among the few of the inoculated who happen to become infected, while its use is unattended with more than a few day’s discomfort. detention when travelling, except for such time as may be necessary to disinfect such of his baggage or clothing as may be considered suspicious* He shall not be liable to daily observation for ten days after arrival from a Initials of operator. Note.— This certificate exempts the holder from segregation, from detention when travelling and from ten days’ observation under the passport rules. It does not, however, exempt him from liability to evacuate an infected house, except in the case where all the occupants of the house have been inoculated, or to have his clothes disinfected when travelling. The certificate is valid for a period of six months. 92. Persons who have been detained in a camp or otherwise under obser vation in Rajputana, including Ajmer-Merwara, shall on departure be may still exist against it.

Arrest. The exercise by the Railway Police of the power of arrest without war rant given them in section 131 of the Indian Railways Act (IX of 1890) for offences under section 101 of the same Act, is discretionary. It should be exercised only in extreme cases as for instance when— (a) there has been loss of life or serious injury to persons; or (b) a person is caught in the commission of a grave offence ; (c) the accused is likely to abscond or to continue to endanger the safety of the public. When arrest is made without warrant, immediate intimation of such arrest must be given to the head of the railway employees Department. £. Under ordinary circumstances, no immediate arrest is necessary. A warrant should be applied for in the usual manner, the police maintaining a watch over the movements of the accused, where this precaution is deemed necessary. 8. When arrest is effected by warrant, the warrant should in the absence of any direction to the contrary in the warrant under section 77 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, be executed by a Police officer of rank superior to that of a Head Constable, First Grade, or by any Station House Officer within his own limits. The officer entrusted with the execution of the war rant will execute it judiciously, and if the arrest is likely to cause risk or in convenience to the public, make arrangements to prevent the escape of the accused and apply to the head of his department to have him relieved, arrest being deferred till he is so relieved. * 8 1 According to the classification on p. 5 supra. 2 Under the terms of notification No. 507-1., dated the 6 th February 1896 (printed p. 121 supra) orders under Acts in force in the Civil and Military Station of Bangalore are in force in the railway lands in Mysore over which jurisdiction has been ceded, unless declared to the contrary.
