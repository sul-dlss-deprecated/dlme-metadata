Mr Belgrave spoke iojme about the replacement of the Indian police by Soudanese, and i think it would be a good thing. There is a large negro element in Bahrain, and they would merge in the population more than Indians do. Mr Belgrave has had previous experience of them in Egypt and says that they make efficient police. he suggested to me that when he proceeded on leave in 1931 he should recruit them on his way out ard bring them back with him. i think this arrangement would be satisfactory, and might be given effect to irrespective of the arrival or non-arrival of the oil company, and l trust the Government of India will be pleased to approve of it. -**-** ■* 13. * * * As regards the police, Mr jrarke will probably resign in a year or two, ana the question of his successor can be taken up then: it depends to a great extent on whether oil is found in Bahrain or not. Mean while however 1 recommend that steps should be taken to replace the Indian police by Soudanese next year, and request the approval of the Government of maia to this. f. h /?&gt;&lt;*'I' kL0&gt; jj'rom - The deputy secretary to the Government of India in tne foreign and. r'olicical Department* - The non*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your despatch No. 112 of April 5th transmitting a copy of an enquiry from Hie Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs regarding the possibility of recruiting Sudanese for the police force of the State of Bahrein. 2. The Sudan Government would have no objection on political grounds to this proposal, but I think it desirable to make abundantly clear from the outset that in my view there is not the slightest chance that recruits will be forthcoming. 3. The far distance of Bahrein from the Sudan, the dislike of the Sudanese for service outside their own country, the cade with which good wages may be earned in the Sudan and the existence there of immense tracts available for cultivation, render it most improbable that any natives would consider service abroad as a substitute preferable to work in their own natural environment. I may add that it is not always easy to obtain recruits for the police forces of the Sudan itself. 4. If the pay offered were very high, it is just possible that a few more adventurous spirits might be disposed to regard the proposal with favour, but I confess that it is unlikely that they would be of the type needed for a police force. I have, however, no information as to the terms of service offered. 5. If it is desired to pursue the matter further, I should be glad to know more regarding the conditions, a.g. the pay offered, housing, leave, rations, cost of living, payment of passages, facilities for repatriation in the case of those who wished to return to the Sudan before completion of their engagement and whether the recruits could take their families with them.

Firstly, I would say that, in my opinion, it is very desirable to retain the services of a European police officer at Bahrain for some time to come. There is no Bahraini who is in any way qualified to fill this post, or who could exercise the necessary control over the police force or retain the confidence of the general public. The heterogeneous nature of the population of Bahrain and the latent feuds among them render it most necessary that the State should have at its disposal an adequate force to maintain the peace. Mr. Parke, does not, I understand, intend to stay on at Bahrain very much longer, but he is unwilling to commit himself to any definite period at present as much depends on certain domestic circumstances. In any case, howevef, he is prepared to remain on for another year. His services hitherto have been satisfactory and I have been impressed with the efficiency of the force that he commands, and he has now acquired a good knowledge of the local populace, and, of course, knows the language. I therefore consider it desirable that he should be kept on for the present at any rate. * * * * * * * * # * * * *From i°i Mo. F.164-N/29. ouSHirE WEMOtNCY. i 1h a** - [/tie.

Finally four measures were proposed, which it was hoped would meet the immediate necessities of the situation and Hr. Belgrave said he would submit them for consideration to the Deputy Ruler. These measures were aa follows: xxx x xx xx x (b) That the Indian police snould be replaced by local men as their contracts expire. XXX XXX X X X X X X X X X 7. The Bahrain police force at present consists of 48 Indians, 57 Arabs and 121 naturs. The latter are local men who ar unarmed and merely do watch and ward duties in the bazaar. The regular police form- what would be termed in India an armed reserve• The Indians are undoubtedly costly since a sepoy draws Rs.35/- pay, plus rations, which formerly cost Rs.l-V- out now » cost about Rs^lO/- plus uniforms and passages to their homes ever; two years. The Arabs draw Rs.25/- plus rations and uniforms while the naturs get Rs.25/- phd no extras. The object ox having Indians in the police force was to preserve the peace among the heterogeneous elements which comprise the population of these Islands in the event of riots. 'The number of Indians, however, has • • •- 2 - has been gradually reduced to 48 and the Arabs increased to 57, and I am informed that the latter are now proving satisfactory and it is believed that they could be relied upon in am emergency. However, the various elements of the Bahrain community have for some years now lived together in peace and amity and the danger of intercommunal rioting has certa.nly diminished though it has probably not entirely disappeared. The risk therefore of having a force composed entirely of Arabs As not a great one anu the financial situation justifies, or rather necessitates, running a slight risk. As the Political Agent points out, the substitution of Arabs for the remainigg Indians would effect a saving of about Rs.6,000/- in addition to the cost of passages and leave pay.

'lA/'b The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, The Hon*hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Sir, _ CT Dated New Delhi, the y March 1932. BAtiRAlh POLIOS. ; ^ With reference to your letter No. C.7 of 1931, dated the 22nd January 1932, I am directed to say that the Government of India have carefully considered the proposal for the replacement of the Indian Police at Bahrain hy local elements in the light of what occurred at Aden in connection with the reorganization of the police there. At Aden it was decided in 1928 that the armed section of the police should consist of 200 locally recruited men, and that for the period required to recruit and train the new force, a section of armea Indians should be engaged for temporary service. A section of 100 armed Indians was organized accordingly. The recruitment of Arabs for the permanent force began in September 1930. As the time for the disbandment of the temporary Indian force was approaching however it was pointed out by the local authorities that the Arab as an armed policeman is an unknown quantity and that difficulties were experienced in securing efficient Arab officers. The Resident accordingly proposed for reasons of security that one third of the total armed force should be recruited in India, and thatthe composition of the force should he re-examinea after a period of 3 years. The Government of India recommended these proposals to his majesty’s Government by whom they have been accepted. 2. In view of the above I am to request that you will consider whether it would not be safer to observe the s same principle regarding the retention of the IndiaJU element in the Bahrain police. Your views may kindly be communicated to the Government of India at an early date. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.

The Political Agent and I have given the matter much receive • • •• 2 - ^ confronted witii a heary deficit* 3* When I wrote my letter Ho.C-7 of the 22nd January 1932 X reported that the monthly deficit wae He»8 9 000 s the receire no less than 575&amp; of the revenues* Further, Bahrain has much the most civilised population of any place in the Gulf, and such a community naturally look to the State not only to maintain law and order but also to provide them with facilities for the education of their children, some courts for the rapid adjudication of their disputes, and some measure of sanitation and the ordinary amenities of existence* And though the administration is, I think, rightly kept on the simplest lines 43 ^ of the present revenue (which is all that is left nowadays after the A1 Khalifa allowances have been paid) will not suffice to meet expenditure and the State is Political Agent reported in March that it had mounted to over Rs* 12,000/- (vide my telegram Ho.173, dated 13th March 1932) and even assuming that that was a specially bad month, it seems improbable that the average deficit will be less than Rs.10*000 per mensem,i*e. Rs*1*20,000 per annum, r 4. To meet this the State has a reserve of 3 lakhs, which it is clear will not go very far and which it is un desirable to drain completely. And the total economies suggested are calculated to produce only Rs.43*000/- in a full year, and even if they are all accepted and introduced will only produce about half that sum during the coming financial year. The temporary abolition of the post of Commandant of Police and the substitution of Arabs for Indians in the police cannot in any case be brought about till next autumn when their contracts expire, while I have not yet received any proposals \ regarding Aakat, which will certainly take some time *o introduce* 5 . y5. The position therefore la that the State is confronted with a Tery large deficit and to meet this economies have been proposed which are really entirely inadequate 9 and for the moment the State is really gambling on the possibility of a trade revival. Unfortunately, however, the chief trade of Bahrain is that in pearls, a luxury trade which even ass iming some improvement in general eommercial conditions should manifest it self in the near future, will probably be one of the last to revive, and I feel myself that before long much more drastic measures will be necessary, while if the measures already proposed are whittled down it will but hasten the end. 6 . Further, in this connection I would venture to invite a reference to Government of India telegram Mo.3458-S of 26th Movember 1929 to His Majesty*s Secretary of State for India. It is clear from this and from the subsequent correspondence that ensued that at that time the Government of India disliked the presence of Indian police at Bahrain and, as will be seen, efforts were made to get Sudanese to replace them but were not successful. Whether Sudanese would have been any more reliable than Arabs I cannot say, having had no experience of them; they would have had the advantage of not being local men, but in view of the very large negro element in Bahrain would probably soon have got merged into the general population. I am not sure whether it is correct to say now that the Arab as an armed policeman is an unknown quantity; the police in * Iraq are all Arabs and have, I believe, showed themselves to be reliable and efficient, and though the Bahrain police can hardly be expected to attain qh&amp;te the same standard my personal opinion ^ they should be able to deal with minor di st-urb^nrsc but that in the case of really serious trouble arising as for instance ...-4- inatanee riots such as occurred in 1923 it vill always, eren if there was a small nucleoua of Indians in the police force, be necessary to inwoke the assistance of His Majesty's ships* 7* In a place with so heterogeneous a population as I Bahrain some risk will be inYolYed as/atated in my letter Bo* C.7 of the 22nd January 1932 if the Indian element in the police force is entirely eliminated, but I do not regard it as rery serious, and, haring regard to the financial situation, I feel that it must be faced* In normal times it would hare been preferable to replace the Indian police more gradually but the times unfortunately are not normal, and the State is compelled at the present time to seek erery possible economy and there is no doubt that these Indians on their high rate of pay together with passages, etc. cost the State a very substantial sum. For these reasons I feel that lean but adhere to my former recommendation that the Indian police should be sent back to India on the expiry of their present contracts.

I have the honour to refer to your letter No.l87-S dated the 30th March, 1932, and to say that the fourth para graph states that T I have not yet received any proposals regarding zakat f 2. The levy of zakat is in no way precluded by treaty obligations, and the State is not under administration, so His Excellency Shaikh Hamad is presumably in a position to levy this tax without reference to outside authority. Since the quotation I have made from your letter appears to antici pate a prior reference to you, I would be glad if you would be good enough to say whether my view is correct or not. 3. Another point arises in tne same letter. The Govern ment of India in their letter F.164-N/29 dated the 9th March, 1932, question the reliability of the Arab police, on the analogy of the precedent at Aden. This appears to me to arise from the misconception that the Aden Arab and the Bahrain Arab are one and the same. I believe the Aden police recruit Somalis, one of the most unreliable elements in the Arabic speaking world, whereas the T Arab T Police at Bahrain are either blacks,who are as trustworthy as Sudanese, and invariably employed by mainland Amirs for the bodyguards, or else Persians whom I have found to be cheerful mercenaries, faithful even when used against their own countrymen.Page 2 4. The Government of Intiia are also probably mentally comparing the local Indian police with what careful super vision produces in India. Incompetent administration ha$&amp; snapped the usefulness of the Bahrain Indian police and they are an indolent and dispirited body.

Extract from note by Sir Jen$s Bray dated 6th November 1927 (follow ng his visit to Bahrain). British interference is especially over-advertised in the' police, a particularly fine body of men, all Jhinjabi Muhammadans, with uniform and drill of an Indian regiment. They suggest at once foreign rule, and make it look as if the present state of Bahrain depends for its security on Indian bayonets alone. ( A striking contrast is afforded by the appearance of the .x.P.O.C. Persian Persian policemen in the British Settlement at Abadan). In this, as in all matters, we should cling to essentials and discard the trimmings.

The use of force by the Police is regulated entirely by the provisions of the law. Those provisions are contained in Chapter Y (especially sections 46 and 50) and Chapter IX (especially sections 127 and 128) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The main principle to be observed is that the degree of force employed shall be regulated according to the circum stances of each case. The object of the use of force is to quell a disturbance of the peace, or to disperse an assembly which threatens such disturbance and has either refused to disperse or shows a determination not to disperse; no ulterior objects, such as punitive or repressive effect, shall be taken into consideration. Any officer in charge of a police station or police officer of higher rank has power, independently of the authority of a Liagistrate, to call upon an unlawful assembly to disperse and to use force to disperse it. (See section 127, Criminal Procedure Code.) Mien a liagistrate (other than an Honorary magistrate) is present or can be communicated witn without such delay as would prejudice the situation an assembly shall not be called upon to disperse nor shall force be used to disperse it without orders of such Magistrate, provided that, if a gazetted police officer is present, and no Magistrate having first class or higher powers is present, such police officer shall act independently in ordering an assembly to disperse. In other circumstances the senior police officer present, having the powers of an officer in charge of a police station, shall act on his own responsibility, but shall communicate with and report his action to the Senior Magistrate who may be accessible, as soon as possible. Miether acting under the orders of a Magistrate or not, once the order to disperse a crowd has been given the method by which force shall be applied and the degree of force to beused shall be decided by the senior police officer present^ provided that, if the District Magistrate is hi :self present, he, as head of the police force of the district, shall be recognised to be the senior police officer present- For the purposes of this rule a Sub-Divisional Magistrate within his sub-division shall have the status of a District Magistrate, i-e., he shall be recognised by all police officers, of the sub-division, as the senior police officer, and shall have power to decide the method and degree of force to be used. All attempts to disperse a crowd by warnings, exhorta tion, etc-, shall be made before it is declared an unlawful assembly and, as such ordered to disperse. Once an order to disperse has been defied, or when the attitude of a crowd is obviously defiant, force shall be used without hesitation. The degree of force used shall be the minimum which the responsible officer, with the exercise of due care and attention, decides to be necessary for the effective dispersal of the crowd and the making of such arrests as may be desired. The degree and duration of the use of force shall be limited as much as possible, and the least deadly weapon whicn the circumstances permit shall be used. The effectiveness of force depends mainly upon the determination with which it is applied; its direction against the most defiant section of the crowd to be dispersed, and its absolute control. Failure to act on this principle results inevitably in more force being applied and more dangerous weapons being used than would otherwise have been necessary. It is not possible to lay down any more definite rule as to when different methods or different weapons shall be used. The officer responsible is required to decide this in each case on consideration of the strength and attitude of the crowed to be dispersed, and the strength of the force available for its dispersal. 'Wien the responsible police officer, whether acting under the orders of a Magistrate or independently, considersvi r-_ that the use of fire-arms is necessary, he shall, under circumstances make such action impossible, warn the crowed that if they do not ir mediately disperse, fire with live ammunition will be opened upon them. If the District Magistrate or, in a sub-division the sub-divisional officer is present his orders shall invariably be obtained immediate ly the necessity of opening fire becomes imminent. If the senior police officer present is of non-gazetted rank, he shall at such stage obtain the orders of the senior a&amp;gistrate present (other than an Honorary Magistrate). In order that the decision to open fire may be promptly acted upon without loss of control or confusion, the responsible police officer shall, as soon as it appears likely that the use of fire-arms will be necessary, tell off a detachment of armed police to be held in readiness. IVhen fire is to be opened, the responsible police officer shall decide the minimum volume necessary to be effective in the circumstances and shall give precise orders accordingly, as to the particular men or files who are to fire and the number of rounds to be fired; whether buckshot or ball is to be used, and whether volleys or independent aimed shots are to be fired, and shall ensure that his orders are not exceeded and that no firing contrary to or without orders takes place. Whatever volume of fire is ordered, it shall be applied with the maximum of effect, the aim shall be kept low and directed to the most threatening parts of the crowd; firing over the heads of or at the fringes of the crowd shall not be allowed. II. Action of Police when use of Military force becomes necessary. A police officer, of whatever rank, has no authority to require any officer, commissioned or non-commissioned, in command of a military detacnment to use force in dispersing a crowd. Any Magistrate may make such a requisition (section Y-'(section 130, Criminal Procedure Code) and, in emergencies;;/^/ when no iMagistrata can be communicated with, a commissioned officer of the Regular Irmy may himself order military force to be used* When no magistrate is available and troops are present, and their intervention, is in the opinion of the senior police officer present, necessary, that officer shall inform the senior commissioned Regular Army officer present of the situation, requesting his assistance in support of the police, if necessary. The military officer receiving such report will decide whether to act on it. When military force has been set in motion for the dispersal of a crowd, any police force previously employed in contact with such crowd shall be withdrawn to prevent confusion. The senior police officer present and the officer commanding the troops shall confer as to the method and exact time of such withdrawal, and as to the subsequent employment of the police; provided that, if the District Magistrate is present, his instructions shall be obtained and acted upon. While no rule can be laid down absolutely, the normal procedure ®£ snould be for the police to be so withdrawn as to leave a free field of action to tine troops, and to be used thereafter (a) in support of the troops for making arrests and pursuing a broken mob, (b) for guarding the flanks and rear of the troops from attack and preventing the outbreak of disturbances in other areas. It must be noted that, when the order to disperse an unlawful assembly by military force has been given, the senior police officer on the spot and all police at the time within the area where military force is being employed come under the orders of the senior military officer present, who is in charge of t e operation of dispersal, and remain under his orders to this extent and for tne period necessary, but the laLter rnusu consult the senior police officer present in any action he thinks it necessary to take. When control of the situation is definitely handed over by the senior civil officer to the military authorities, thepolice force come fully under military control (Note- Part II of this appendix is in conformity with the secret instructions on the subject issued by the G-ovt. of India, -urmy Department).Extract from the Report of the Officers held at New Delhi in 1929* Chapter II. Report on the questions referred to the Conference. Item No. 1.- Principles to be observed if firearms have to be used for the dispersal of Unlawful Assemblies. USE QE-„EIREARM3 FOR DI.PE.^AL OF IJNLA ^UL_ASSEr£L IEU. - Discussion of this subject showed that the instructions at present in force in the different provinces vary in certain important details. The variations have been fully examined and the whole question of the duties of the police with regard to the dispersal of unlawful assemblies has been carefully considered with reference to every important point which might conceivably be held to be suitable for inclusion in a set of general principles likely to be accepted throughout India. The Conference considers it un necessary to set out a list of these points or to state the important differences between the regulations in force in die various provinces. The difficulties inherent in the problem of dealing with unlawful assemblies depend in each case on the character and violence of the assembly and the particular circumstances of the time and place. In order, therefore, not to hamper the discretion of police officers, it is imperative that any principles put forward for general guidance should be as elastic as possible; the suggestion which has been made that a manual of detailed directions and advice should be compiled is in the opinion of the conference impracticable, for to bind police officers to a rigid code would inevitably place them in situations of very great difficulty and perhaps of danger. While the Conference has been guided by this opinion, the members have, however, been able, subject to a reservation on one point by the representative of Madras Presidency, to Conference of Police. . . a frsune unanimous decisions on all the more important questio: connected with the use of firearms on occasions of riots. These decisions should be sufficient to give the Govt, of India and Provincial Governments a basis for the framing of rules and a foundation on which each Local Govt, will be able to draw up suitable instructions for the police and especially for the training and guidance of young police officers and of the subordinate ranks. The Conference recommends thara as stated below for general acceptance. u£_M ^i 5 trate:- and.PoIice Offi cers.- With regard to the question of the relative responsibility of magistrates and police officers on occasions when firearms are used, though the law permits any police officer o^br above the rank of station-house officer to use firearms when necessary for the dispersal of an unlawful assembly, the general practice is that a magistrate is deputed to accompany the police employed on such occasions and it is he who orders the opening of fire should the circumstances demand it. The Conference considers this practice advantageous in many ways, but realises that difficulties have arisen and are likely to arise with regard to the sharing of respon sibility by the magistrate and the police officer when recourse to the extreme measure of firing becomes necessary. After discussion of these difficulties the Conference is agreed that it is advisable to differentiate between the occasions when a gazetted police officer is present and those when the senior police officer present is below gazetted rank. QEjar..f.flE-uafi, Q f-firgams-,wh m ^.,gaze tted , poli^ officer is present .In cases of serious emergency when the police are under the command of a gazetted police officer the District magistrate or a magistrate specially selected by him should be present. Such a magistrate after exercising his power by directing the gazetted police officer to use firearms for the dispersal of the unlawful assembly, as a general rule, should not fetter his discretion regardingu the disposition of his force, the methods to be employed or the volume of fire to be used. ilhen no gazetted police officer is present, the magistrace should, as usua,l,be responsible for determining when fire is to be opened and should also decide the volume of fire to be used but not its direction. The Madras delegate urges that when a gazetted police officer is present it should not be necessary for him to seek and obtain the permission of the magistrate before ordering the use of firearms. Actual order to fire . - In all cases the actual order to 'fire' or to 'cease fire' should invariably be given by the police officer in comnand. Warning to,unlawful assembly . - Before directing the police officer in command to order the use of firearms, the magistrate, as a part of the full and sufficient warning of the consequences of failure to disperse which he is required to give to the members of the unlawful assembly, should warn them that the firing will be effective. The direction to use firearms should be given only in the last resort when it is considered impossible to disperse the unlawful assembly by any other means. Right of private__defence. - The conference considers that nothing in these suggestions should be construe^hs depriving the police of the rights conferred on them by Chapter IV of the Indian Penal Code. QE d &amp;r- t, fl_cease fi re_when to_he ^ive n. - When no magistrate is present the police officer in co,imand, as is contemplated in the Criminal Procedure Code, shall be responsible for the opening of fire. Invariably whether the order to use firearms has been given by a magistrate or by a police officer, the order to cease fire shall be given by as soon as the unlawful assembly shows a disposi tion to retire or to disperse. Volume Q£_fii;;£ . - On the question of the extent to which firearms should be used, the Conference having examined the rules in force in various provinces is in favour of the general adoption of the Punjab rule, that&amp; ' 1 &lt;~N • , 1 the degree of force to be used shall be the minimum which the responsible officer, with the exercise of due care and attention, decides to be necessary for the effective dispersal of the crowd. 2a£^-J2f-WDUndea _and. preparation of rep ort• - On occasions when firearms have been used against unlawful assemblies it should be the duty of the magistrate, if one is present, to make adquate arrangements for the care of the wounded persons and for their removal to hospital and also for the disposal of the dead, if any. He should also, then and there, draw up a full report in consultation with the senior police officer present, stating all the circumstances and noting the number of rounds of ammunition issued and expended. If no magistrate is present, this report should be prepared by the senior police officer. Am&amp;l .force nut-l a-be brought too near a dangerou s CUflld* - While the disposition of the police must be left to the police officer in command, every precaution should be taken that a force armed with fire-arms is not brought so close to a dangerous crowd, as to risk its either being overwhelmed by numbers or being forced to inflict heavy casualties. If the use of firearms cannot be avoided, firing should be carried out from a distance sufficient to obviate the risk of the force being rushed and to enable strict fire-control to be maintained. PQstiag..flf..police im-QCC^ions _cf. religious festival? . On occasions of religious festivals police carrying fire arms should ordinarily not be employed to escort processions. They should be posted at points where there is danger of a disturbance or should be held in reserve as a moving picket either in front or in the rear of the procession where they are in least danger of being thrown into confusion by the mob and can be kept under the control of the officer in command and of their petty officers. ErpPQrtion^af^Qffleers to be high .- When police are likely to be employed as a firing party against anunlawful assembly'the proportion of officers and petty officers to the men should be as high as possible. Bayonets .- It is expedient that on occasions v?hen firearms are likely to be used, bayonets should fir t oe fixed; this, besides being a precautionary measure of self protection, affords a warning to the members of the unlawful assembly. Amnunitio n. - While the Conference is of opinion that good buckshot is ordinarily the most satisfactory ammunition for use against rioters, it considers it advisable owing to the defects in the police muskets and ammunition now in use that both ball and buckshot ammunition should be served out to armed parties carrying M.H. muskets who are likely to be employed for the dispersal of an unlawful assembly. •Where the force is armed with rifles, ball ammunition only can be used. Firing to be a p plied with_max imiiii:.-^£feai.- Whenever the use of firearms is necessary, the Conference considers that whatever volume of firing is ordered should be applied with the maximum effect. Firing should, as a rule, be directed at the legs of the rioters and must never be directed over their heads or in the air. whenever possible it should be directed against the ring-leaders or the more violent members of the crowd. Pftlir.ft fa-omg different wavs. - The question of the disposition of the police if they have to be posted to face different ways has been considered with reference to letter No. F.-3/1-20-Police, dated the 11th January 1928, from the Govt, of India to all Local Governments. This question is, in the opinion of the Conference, one of tactics and, there fore, in accordance with the view already expressed, should be left for decision by the police officer in command on - I each occasion.

It commends these instructions to the notice of the Government of India and suggest that IMxr the Governments of other provinces should be asked to consider the advisabi lity of incorporating these or similar instructions in their Police Regulations.-I* APPENDIX A. Formula for the guidance of officers dealing w ith rj ftfr The conduct of Army officers during H.E.Ap. Rhys Price, C.B.,C.M.G.,D.B. riots by Major-General I was very much struck on coming to India at the end of 1920 by the feeling amongst officers of not knowing exactly where they stood in the case of riots as evidenced in the talk I had with many. There was a general feeling that the hold of the civilian over his district had weakened very much, with the consequent necessity for calling out the military more frequently to maintain order, and that whatever they did, both civilian and military would be the target for hostile criticism and even have to justify their conduct before a committee or in a court of law. This feeling of uncertainty was rendered somewhat bitter by the fact of many inciters to violence and anti-government measures not being called upon to justify their comuct or to uphold law and order. 2. I, therefore, thought it would be useful, if, without in any my clashing with the official instructions on the subject, some simple formula could be evolved, which, if acted upon, would not only be a correct guide to any officer dealing with a riot, but would also steer him through fhe many legal pitfalls that might await him after the riot. I wrote out a tentative formula which I submitted to two lawyers and a High Court Judge. This was gone through as if I had been the officer concerned in several well-known riots, and the formula amended where it did not satisfy the law, until it became a practical working one. Since then it haa been tested in an actual case of riot in the law courts, and the officer concerned was commended for his action. Jith the resent increase of communal riots, I though^ it might be useful to pass it on, so that it might be available for all officers, an d be helpful to them when performing their duty in riots.^ S' ^ I I &gt; Li 3» The formula is drawn up on the lines of a statement that would he made in a law court and a logical course of action, and if held in mind during a riot will also prove a guide to one’s correct action at the moment. It is as fol-iows:- 'The attitude of the rioters was such that in my opinion (a) there was danger to life and/or property, (b) and that nothing short of firing would prevent it.' 'The rioters were, therefore, warned to desist and disperse or I should be compelled to fire, and such warning was given in an audible manner. (c) The rioters, however, would not desist, or disperse and I, therefore, ordered (d) to fire. Tne moment the rioters showed signs of dispersing (e) I ceased fire and had the wounded tended, (f) and sent by ambulance to hospital.' 4. I attach a few explanations which will make clear some of the points against which I have put letters in the above formula or statement. 5. Note ( a). - 'In my opinion' is important as the officer is the judge on the spot, and full credit will be given to him for his personal opinion. If 'in my opinion' is not stated the question of fact becomes more accentuated. If there is a ii&amp;gistrate present, it is his duty to ask the officer to order firing if he considers it necessary, but it must be remembered that if the magistrate loses his nerve, and asks for firing unnecessarily, the officer becomes liable for unnecessary fire also, so it is necessary to be guided by full consideration of what is in note (b) below. Consideration should also be had to whether lesser measures such as hitting with butts, seizing a ringleader, etc. would do. 6. Note ( b).- If the rioters started looting and damaging property, or knocking down or throwing stones at peaceful citizens or the detachment, so that there was real dangerto life or property, or of pushing back the detachment from^if its position, firing would be justified. Here the great legal principle is £&gt;glf Je l ence • i.e* as an officer of the State, and therefore an upholder of law and order, it is an obliga tion on an officer to see to the defence of property, life and the safety of his detachment* The officer should have facts ready such as 'I saw men breaking down the doors of houses, or two of my men were rendered senseless by stones, etc.' M£Lt£—(ihl* • There should be no doubt but that the rioters heard the warning order. Usually this is given by sounding a bugle or whistle, then stepping forward and warning the crowd in a loud voice that unless they immediately disperse fire will be opened. In cross examination a hostile prosecution is very prone to try to prove that no adequate warning was given. Firing without warning is only justified in an emergency, wdien the rioters are armed with lethal weapons and are actually burning and looting houses and beating or killing people. Note (fl) *- It should be stated here, whether individuals, a section, etc., were ordered to fire. The great legal principle here is The use of Minipmm 9. Hote ls) .- The moment there are signs of dispersal fire should be stopped, as the object of the fire has been obta ned and the principle of minimum force is being complied with. It is also important as in cfotes-examination a hostile prosecution is apt to bring up all the cases of shots in the bacK as proof that fire was continued too long. 10. The point of not attending to the wounded was severely criticised by the Hunter Committee as showing a lack of humanity and impartiality in one whose duty it 1 I is to maintain law and order. In war one tends the enemy’s wounded, and equal care should be shown to misguided people who get wounded during riots. ^ trust the above notes may be of use to my brother officers.)£ APPENDIX B. o (§ 7 ) APPENDIX B. Action of Police when the use of Military Force becomes necessary. (Extract from Punjab Police Rules.) A police officer, of whatever rank, has no authority to require any officer, commissioned or non-commissioned, in conimand of a military detachment to use force in dispersing a crowd. Any magistrate may make such a requisition (section 130 Criminal Procedure Code) and, in emergencies when no magistrate can be communicated with, a commissioned officer of the Regular Army may himself order military force to be used. When no magistrate is available and troops are present, and their intervention is in the opinion of the senior police officer present, necessary, that officer shall inform the senior comnissioned Regular Army officer present of the situation, requesting his assistance in support of the police, if necessary. The military officer receiving such report will decide whether to act on it. PS When military force has been set in motion for the dispersal of a crowd, any police force previously employed in contact with such crowd shall be withdrawn to prevent confusion. The senior police officer present and the officer commanding the troops shall confer as to the method and exact time of such withdrawal, and as to the subsequent employment of the police; provided that, if the District Magistrate is present, his instructions shall be obtained and acted upon. While no rule can be laid down absolutely, the normal procedure should be for the police to be so withdrawn as to leave a free field of action to the troops, and to be used thereafter (a) in support of the troops for making arrests and pursuing a broken mob, (b) for guarding the flanks and rear of the troops from attack and preventing the outbreak of disturbances in other areas. It must be noted that, when the order to disperse an unlaw ful assembly by military force has been given, the senior police officer on the spot and all police at the time within the area where military force is being employed come under thewmmm —— ((&gt;' * orders of tne senior military officer present, who is in of the operation of dispersal, and remain under his orders ana to this extent/for the period necessary, but the latter must consult the senior police officer present in any action he tninks it necessary to take* //hen control of the situation is definitely handed over by the senior civil officer to the military authorities, the police force come fully under military control*Secret No. D.2312.

All Local Governments and Administrations. ri Subject:- Principles to be observed by Magistrates and the Police in opening fire on mobs. Sir, I am directed to refer to Home Department letter No. F.8/I/28-Police, dated the 11th January 1923, on the above subject, and to say that the considerations to which attention was invited in that letter regarding the danger of allowing a body of police armed with firearms to be brought into close contact with a hostile mob, applying equally to the case of a military force acting in aid of the civil power. It is of the utmost importance that troops depending on firearms should not be committed to a hand-to-hand struggle with a dangerous mob, and I am to ask that the attention, of all Magistrates who may in accordance with section 129 and 130 of the Criminal Procedure Code have to require an unlawful assembly to disperse by military force may be prominently drawn to the importance of observing this principle. I am &amp;lso to ask that their attention may be drawn to the importance of acting in consultation with the military commander throughout. I have, etc., 3d. H.W. Emerson, Secretary to the Government of India.MTflM OP ANTITTM OM TTTO P'P’r^TTT QI'T'rrwT amt» -nimr AVTur^tim ATT* » f T T T m » TTy V Three distinct stages may occur in the employment of military assistants in aid of the civil power* These are:- (ii) the use of troops for the actual dispersal of unlawful assemblies under the procedure laid down in Chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure f (iii) the retention of troops for restoring order after disturbances have occurred. 2. The first stage is that referred to in paragraph 75 of annexure 15 of the Internal Security Instructions, India, 1926. It is there laid down that 'the civil authorities have the right when they have reason to think that a disturbance is likely to occur which will be beyond the power of the police to control, to call in the aid of the military to prevent the disturbances from coming to a head'. The intention is that military assis tance will not be called for unless the civil force is inadequate (and of this the civil authority is the judge) but, that when called for, military aid must be accorded. The strength, the composition of the force, the quantity of ammunition to be taken and the manner of carrying out the operation are matters for the decision of the military authorities; but the civil authority may and should, by reason of his fuller knowledge of the circum stances of the disturbance which is likely to occur, or has occurred, and of local conditions, give the military authority the benefit of his opinion as to the number and class of troops, e.g*, cavalry, infantry or armoured cars which may be necessary. The opinion of the civil authority should take the form of suggestion only and should be framed so as to avoid any appearance of attempting to prescribe the composition and strength of the force, for the final decision must rest with the military. Whenever possible, the question should be settled by personal discussion betv/een the two authorities. It should be remembered in this connection that, as laid down in paragraph 76(iv) of annexure 15 of the Internal Security Instructions, the power to (i) the calling in of troops as a precautionary measure,request the military authorities to send regular troops fro outstations, except in cases of extreme emergency is vested in the Local Government* When there are no troops in the area affected, the District Officer should, therefore, telegraph for troops to the Local Government indicating the kind and number of troops which are likely to be required in view of the local circumstances. In cases of extreme urgency, he should address the military authorities direct repeating the telegram to the Local Government and should, in addressing the military authorities, note that he had addressed the Local Government. 3. As regards the second stage, the law on the subject of dispersal of unlawful assemblies (sections 127-132, Criminal Procedure Code)is quite clear and is briefly as follows:- Any magistrate or officer in charge of a police station may order an unlawful assembly ( vide definition in section 141, Indian Penal Code) or an assembly of five or more persons likely to cause a disturbance of the public peace, to disperse. If it cannot be otherwise dispersed, the magistrate of the highest rank present may cause it to be dispersed by military force and for this purpose may require any commissioned or non-commissioned officer in command of soldiers to disperse it and to arrest such part as he nay direct. The officer thus directed must 'obey such requisition in such manner as he thinks fit', but in so doing must 'use as little force and do as little injury to person and property' as may be consistent with the object of dispersing the crowd or of arresting or detaining members of it. It may be remarked that as soon as the unlawful assembly can be held to have been dispersed, the control by the military authority ceases and must be resumed by the civil authority. The question whether the unlawful assembly has or has not been dispersed should be decided by the magistrate in consultationwith the military authority which has undertaken dispersal and who must be satisfied that the safety of his force is not thereby endangered. The magistrate must then assume control of the situation from the time when he decides that the unlawful assembly has been dispersed. A* ^hen no magistrate can be coommicated with, any commissioned officer may, if public security is manifestly endangered by such assembly, himself disperse it by military force and may arrest any person in it. But, if while acting in this manner it becomes practicable to communicate with a magistrate, he shall do so and thenceforward obey the instructions of the latter as to whether he shall or shall not continue such action. 5. The law does not prescribe that before a mob is dispersed by military force a formal warning should be given or any interval allowed between the warning and the fdringi but Government has laid down that warning ought to be given 'wherever possible 1 '. The manner and the form of warning must depend on circumstances, and it is recognized that sometimes it may be exceedingly difficult to convey the warning, ’^/here a magistrate is present he should himself give what warning is possible before he requires the military officer to disperse the assembly, because up to that stage he is responsible. 6. When a magistrate is present and requires a military officef to disperse an unlawful assembly, the law and the King’s Regulations make it clear that absolute discretion lies with the military officer as to the manner in which the necessary action be taken. He is the sole judge of the action necessary, though this must be limited to the pur pose indicated, namely, dispersal of the crowd and the arrest of offenders, and, as already explained, the magistrate may require him to cease action wnen the required object has been attained, li- may be notec. that the magistrate is empowered only to require the military!ii \' Commander to disperse the unlawful assembly or to effect the arrests or both and has no authority to give an order to open fire or to take particular action. The responsibi.ity for opening fire rests with the Military Commander alone and the law authorises him to do this if in his opinion the circumstances so demand, in order to allow him to comply with the requisition of the magistrate. So long as the officer (a) acts in good faith, which means that he exercises due care and attention, Cb) does not use more force than is necessary, and tc) confines himself to the dispersal of the crowd and the arrest of offenders, the law will protect him. 7. Althou^i the law does not require that instructions given by a magistrate to disperse an unlawful assembly should be in writing,jvonetheless he should as soon as N possible after the occurrence confirm his verbal instructions in writing to the military Commander, retaining a copy himself. This procedure will prevent any subsequent question arising as to whether the magistrate did or did not give instructions to the Military Commander for the dispersal of the assembly. 8. When it is not possible to communicate with a magis trate, the officer in charge of troops should himself give such warning as is possible, before dispersing an assembly by force. He should communicate with the magistrate as soon as practicable and thenceforward obey the instructions of the magistrate as to whether he shall or shall not continue his action. It is very desirable that there should be full consultation at this stage between the magistrate and the Military Commander, and that the magistrate should not give an instruction which will endanger the safety of the military force. 9. No prosecution can be undertaken against an officer or non-commissioneu officer for action taken by him either when obeying the requisition of the magistrate, or acting on his own initiative, save with the sanction of Governmentand even if such prosecution takes place, the la# declares that he is not deemed to have committed an offence so long as he acts in good faith (vide section 132 of Criminal Procedure Code). Good faith involves the exercise of due care and attention and the use of as little force and in fliction of as little injury to person and property as is consistent with the object of dispersing the assembly. As regards troops who act under the orders of their officer, there is complete protection for any act done in obedience to any order which they are bound to obey and, so long as they are obeying such order, they are not deemed by law to have committed an offence. 10. In regard to the third stage, namely, the rentention of troops for the general purpose of restoring or maintaining order after a disturbance has occurred, it is not possible to lay down any hard and fast rules. On the one hand, it is undesirable to employ troops longer than is necessary. On the other hand the moral effect produced by the presence of troops may prevent a recrudescence of disorder. The decision must depend on the exig. ncies of the situation which may often extend beyond the immediate seat of trouble. Ordinarily the local civ^l authorities will be in the best position to form an estimate and if after full discussion with the military authorities it is not possible to reach an agreement, the view of the civil authority should prevail pending a reference to the Local Government, who will further discuss the matter with the appropriate ilitary authority. If a difference of opinion still exists the Local Government should refer the matter as soon as possible to the Govt, of India for orders and, pending the receipt of these, the wishes of the Local Government should prevail.Comidential D.O.N0.541-S of 1935* The flesidency, Bus hi re, the 20 th July 935, I enclose copy of a M Formula for the guidance of officers dealing with Riot” drawn u* by Major-General Rhys irice which I have received informally from the Foreign and lolitical Department* with those in India and in the event of riot it would be the State Police force that would take action, the fact remains that in view of our position there criticism of any action taken would be levelled mainly against us* It therefore behoves us to see that any action taken is, as far as possible, on lines generally regarded as correct by the Government of India* Moreover, circumstances may arise in which the necessity for taking action may devolve on the lolitical Agent (as it did partly on Prior in the case of the pearling riots of 1932;, though normally the rolitical Agent should if possible leave things to the Bahrain Govern ment* 3* I am sure that your experience at Peshawar has familiarised you with this question, and I dare say Belgrave also has had experience of dealing with unlawful assemblies* You might, however, give a copy of the Formula to him, and we could then discuss during my visit its bearing on any particular points likely to arise in connection with disturbances at Bahrain* 2* .Vhilat conditions in Bahrain are not on all fours Captain G.A.Cole, I.A*, Officiating rolitical Agent, Bahrain*k|'T Confidential D.O. No. C/432 3? : gySHlRgEEaiDENC-V Dato,.,,,:#lf]“*~ i 5 &lt;f Dated the 24th May 1940 &amp; I enclose v^ith this letter three copies of Hallows 1 Report on the Bahrain Police and his recommendations for the overhaul and re-organisation of the Force. I am writing d&amp;ni-officially as I can discuss the matter more freely in this form. I am afraid the Report has been delayed, but Hallows only had about a month for his investigations while the framing of proposals, their discussion with me, their amendment in several cases and their casting in final form naturally took some time longer. Bven the typing of a Report of this length occupied practically every typewriter in this office for a v/eek, outside office hours/ 2. As I have said the recommendations for re-organisation have been discussed by Hallows and myself and it follows that I shall have no very long comments to make on the details. Nor indeed do I propose to waste time bemoaning the lack of routine efficiency in the Police disclosed by Hallows* Report. We must remember the difficulties there have been in creating a local Force at all, particularly during a period of rapid expansion of all the Bahrain Government* s administrative functions, and be thankful that Chance has given us this opportunity of diagnosing its present internal malady and of prescribing a cure. 3. It might be deduced from Part II of this Report that the Bahrain Police are in such a bad way that they can only be brought to a reasonable state of efficiency by appointing a British Police Officer to take charge of them for at least five years. This however I do not feel is true; and judging by /- The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel C. G. Prior, C.I.3., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.2 - by past experience it would be almost impossible to make the Shaikhs agree willingly to such a proposal. As you are aware they have been congratulated by Kings, Admirals, Ambassadors and lesser men on the appearance of their Police; in spite of the deficiencies of the Police now so clearly disclosed there is remarkably little crime in these Islands; and it can be their duties under the Defence Scheme with real efficiency, the Bahrain Police have at least during the last few years carried out, somehov; or other, the task required of them. Thus the Shaikhs would, I am convinced, resent the suggestion that their Police are so inefficient that they need to be pulled together by a British Police Officer. They cannot really understand cur complaints that police cases sent to the Agency Courts are not properly investigated and are never properly put before the Courts. And it is significant of Hallows to make a critical examination of the whole Police organisation, their immediate reaction was to say that they hoped he would not put forward proposals based too closely on Indian theory and practice, which they thought were un suitable in Bahrain. Then there is another important point. Vftien I came here I found that Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammad taking from my predecessor (whether or not approved by the Political Resident I am unable to say) that he was to return here to take charge of the Police. I know how deeply he felt when the proposal was mooted two and a half years ago to introduce a British Police Officer, and I know that if this It may be argued that this is a matter of little importance argued that with the exception of their failure to perform that when I told them that we proposed to lend the services had been sent for training to Pasik with the definite under proposal were now put into effect he would throw his hand in. since Shaikh Khalifah himself is not a brilliant Police Officer /-Officer with years of service behind him. But I think it would be a great pity, for his appointment to his present post has really done a good deal to improve the prestige of the Police in general, and I think there is little hope of popularising service in the Police for men of better c lass unless they are headed by one of the A1 Khalifah Family. Khalifah himself is very keen, has picked up a very fair amount of knowledge at Nasik, and has co-operated whole-heartedly with Hallows in the belief that he himself will b e enabled to carry out, reforms which he fully recognises are needed in the Police organisation. He has too the right idea about the Agency (to put it no more precisely). Finally we must recognise that the pros pects of obtaining a first-class young officer of the Indian Police at the present juncture are remote in the extreme. 4. It follows therefore that while the plan of re-organi sation does not by any means exclude the possibility of employing a British Police Officer it has been worked out in such a way that it should be possible to put it into effect over a period of two or three years and to expect a fair standard of efficiency without employing such an officer. The strength proposed for the various ranks for both parts of the force has been worked out with strict regard to what we think is the minimum force required for normal peace-time duties in Bahrain and it does not provide for war-time requirements such as the special force to be recruited for protection work at the Oil Field and Refinery. The total strength in fact shows a reduction on the present figure though the total cost of the force is very much the same as it is at the moment, mainly because of the very con siderable increase in the N.C.O. ranks. In brief the object has been to prepare for a better educated and far more highly trained /-Ml ~ ir - 4 - trained force (both for civil and semi-military duties), offering a career which should be attractive to a better type of local resident. It is I think absolutely essential that the force shouldbe composed almost exclusively of local people, however 'awkward' they may be to train, if we are to avoid the difficulties and dangers of the past which followed the recruitment of foreigners. 5. I do not think I need say a great deal more. The re-organisation plan is self-contained even though it will obviously require time to put it into complete effect. I have been in some doubt whether I should show this Report to Belgrave before sending it to you, in order to give him an opportunity of expressing his views, but it seemed desirable to obtain in the first instance your general approval to the scheme that is set out. If you do approve, I think it is essential to call on the Bahrain Government to take immediate action towards implementing it while we still have an ex- Police Officer here as Assistant Political Agent. Presumably Hallows will be in Bahrain for another year in accordance with the promise given when he was first appointed to this Agency and it should be possible for him, once he has passed his Preliminary Arabic - as I think he can now do, tod evote a certain amount of time to watching, advising and guiding the preliminary stages of the re-organisation. He is on the best of terms with Shaikh Khalifah and is well liked by Belgrave, so there is no need to anticipate any friction.INDEX PART I.

The second deals with the results of my inspection and the third contains proposals for reorganisation. In making this report only peace time requirements have been considered. flgag^i Accurate figures of the population of the Bahrain Islands are not available as there has been no census, but the total is estimated at about 150,000. Of this number, Manama, the largest town absorbs some 30,000 and the towns of ft’uharraq and Hedd, in ‘Mharraq Island, some 15,000 and 5,000. Some 6,000 persons live at the oil camp at Awali. Moat of the waalth of the Islands is concentrated in the towns of l anaraa and )«uhai*raq and the majority of influential traders, shop keepers, pearl merchants, property owners and others who inhabit these two towns are foreigners. A municipality was established in Manama in 1919 and 8 years later a municipality was also formed in Muharraq. Of the rest of the popula tion (over two-thirds of the total) which consists mostly of cultivators, fishermen, pearl divers and labourers, the majority live in the numerous small villages which lie in the northern half of the Isfe nd of Bahrain. The villagers are the aboriginal shia inhabitants«• 2 *• hL inliabltanta of the Island (Bahama) who appear to have been little affected by the enormous changes which have taken place In the towns - especially since the discovery of oil. '%ny of these villages are very small consisting of a few families and their Inhabitans are the poorest element of the community with a very low standard of living. In the bigger villages there is usually a person of influence who is regarded as the head of the community and though such persons have no definite responsibilities to the Bahrain Government it is said that generally speaking they co-operate and keep the Government informed of all matters of interest. The Bahamas are not true Arabs and practically speaking the only real Arabs in Bahrain are the members of the Staling family and members of mainland tribes who live almost entirely in T-^uharraq and Held on vuharraq Island and in Budeya and a few small villages in the iouth West of Bahrain Island. iSxcept for patrols by the mounted sections the Police have very little contact with the village population as practically all reported crime takes place in the towns. Wo village records are maintained by the Police. BxAefJjistoix* In 1926 there existed in Bahrain a levy corps of L^uscat Baluchis under the command of a British Offieeri a few municipal n Police f, and a body of Nature for patrolling the streets at night. The Co 4 umanding Officer of t he levy was assisted by an Indian Officer and Nan-Commissioned officers from Punjab,3 &lt;7 Punjab regiments. A series of incidents led to the disbanding of this corps and in (October 1926 a detachment of a Punjab Regiment was stationed at Bahrain for a short time* It was then decided to recruit a force of ex-Indian Army Punjabi r^oslemsy which was to be less milltar y in character and responsible for the proper preservation of law and order* This force of some 200 men was recruited in India and was commanded by a British Officer as Coramandant of Police* The experiment was not a sucess for various reasons and not unnaturally was very unpopular with the people* The Adviser to the Bahrain (tovemment therefore in 1929 began to enlist a force of local men to take the place of the Indians* The transition was completed in 1932 and few of the bei better Indian non-commissioned officers were retained as instructors* The Police Station established in Manama was moved to a better site and Police posts at Muharraq and Hedd were established* Composition of the l-orce. ‘The Police Force at present consists of 8 Havlldarsy 12 Nalks» 28 I/^aiks and 298 men or one policeman for 446 of the population* Its composition is shown in the statement below*6&lt;l The Coromendant of Police is the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the Superintendent of Police Shaikh Khalifah bln Mohammad al Khali fa h who has recently completed ccursee of training at the T a Bombay Politico Training School at Naslk and with the Bombay Sappers and Miners* The Force at present includes 841 Bahrain ArabSy 23 Bahama| 87 Persiano t 7 Baluchis 9 5 Indians y 1 Somali and the rest are Sudanese Swahilis Yemenis mainland Arabs and manumitted sla ves* About 80 are not Bahrain subjects* 5 non-conraissioned officers are literate in Arabic and 9 semi*literate • Of the men 24 can read a nd write simple Arabic but of these not more than 6 are said to be capable of making reports and maintaining records* jillatment.

The Bahrain Order in Council of 1913 gave criminal jurisdiction over all British subjects and Foreigners within the territories of His Highness the Huler of Bahrain to the Agency Courts. The Courts of the Bahrain Government have Jurisdiction only over Bahrain subjects. The powers of Police so far as British subjects and Foreigners are concerned are limited to those granted in this Bahrain Order in Council and the King's Regulations made under it and to those contained in the various Indian criminal enactments extended from time to time to Bahrain. These enactments include x~ 1 . The Indian Penal Code 2. The Whipping Act 3* The India Evidence Act 4. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 5* So much of the Indian Post Offices Act which relates to offences against the Post Office. 6./€• The Code of Criminal Procedure ?• The Fugitive Offenders Act* The powers of the Police so far as Bahrain subjects are concerned have never been defined and are unlimited* The criminal law applicable to Bahrain subjects is contained in a large number of Proclama- tiona issued from tome to time by the Bahrain Government and the compiling of a Simple Code of Criminal Law is a great necessity* ;?fforts are being made to secure the services of a retired Ffeglstrate or Judge who could undertake this work* N&amp;j&amp;rg* Tlxe Police do not patrol at night and the protection of property&gt; the apprehension of suspects arid the initial investigations of crime is carried out by Tatars or night watchmen.

the number which resulted In conviction, acquittal or discharge of the accused, the number of persons convicted, acquitted or discharg ed for each type of offence and in the case of offences against property the value of the property concerned# It is net possible to examine the working of the Police from the figures available# A large number of cases must have gone untraced and some undetected and unreported, but for population of some 160,000 it ia clear that serious crime is now remark ably low# Owing t© the expansion of the field of employment the number of persons without work is probably small and offences against property have decreased# Crime appears to be fairly evenly distri buted between Bahrain subjects and foreigners, the figures for 1938 showing that out of 591 persons sent for trial 302 were foreigners and 289 Bahrain subjects# Political 'i 8 turbanc« 6 » In recent years political agitation has twice assumed fairly serious proportions# Towards the end of 1934 the relations between the Shis and Sunni communities deteriorated# The impact of modern ideas and influence in Bahrain resulted in discontent amongst the Bahamas and caused their le*** j to present sweeping demands to the Bahrain Government# The agitation did not however result in rioting and no importanimportant police action waa called for* The second occurrence took place towards the end of the year 1938 and wee different in character from the first occurrence in that public grievances were virtually absent, though this second movement coincided with a genuine public complaint against the Bahrain Courts* This complaint against the Bahrain Courts gave the opportunity to certain Arab malcontents to turn their attention to the semi- educated youth of Bahrain and to lead them in a violent agitation against the Government and Oil Company* Kxclted by nationalist feelings, the example of what had taken place in Kuwait and Dubai and external press and broadcast propaganda, the youth movement gathered strength and led to a demonstration in t'anama* A number of arrests were made and the demonstration was controlled without having to resort to force*£&amp;32L2* XWmXL Aim Q^FICB8 &gt; AdvisTRte Office • At pr^scmt all matters except those of an unimportant and purely routine nature are dealt with at the offices of the Bahrain Government by men who know nothing of police work* Police files contain papers on a wide variety of subjects and are closed yearly* All correspondence connected with the Police is not kept in these files and thus correspondence with the Agency on matters concerning the Police is kept with the records of correspondence with the Agency* Cn the lolice files there are papers regarding clothing 9 equipment 9 ammunition) there are standing orders, promotion orders, contingent bills, statements of imprest account etc*, etc* To ascertain the existing position in any particular branch of the Police administration is difficult and tedious as correspondence may be amongst a number of files which have nothing to do with Police work* No clear definition has been laid down of the duties, powers and reponsiblllties of the Superintendent of Pellee and this has resulted in some confusion* For instance the Superintendent of Police considered that mattereof pay and accounts were the responsibility of the Adviserste office* The result has been that neither the Superintendent of Police nor the Commandant has checked the pay bill which at any rate for the past six months has been unsigned* There are no records of promotion except the bare orders* There are no records of crime* There are no individual records of men on the lines of a character roll or service sheet* There is no order book in which orders issued by the Commandant are/r\ are entei^d and numbered and dated for reference purposes. There are no schemes for Police action either in the even''of internal disturbances or for Muharram processions or to deal with the remote possibility of an external attack. No record exists of any inspection of the lines or Police station. No records of leave are kept in this office. Police accounts are dealt with by the Accounts Officer who maintains a general cash register for all branches of the Bahrain Government. The Police have a single column in this register in which all payments are entered and the total expendi ture shown at the end of each month. There is no register showing expenditure under the separate heads of the budget estimates. In 1357 estimations were made under the heads State Police) Naturef jails and in 1358 this was expanded to show State Police Nature) Jails t Equipment) Uniforms and General Contingencies. The absence of any ledger containing these heads from which expenditure can be watched from month to month removes a great deal of the value of framing budget estimates in this way* Pay bills of the Police are made out by the Lines Clerk and are brought to the Accounts Officer for checking. A suomary of the pay bill is then prepared for the sanction of the Commandant. Hone of the pay bills for the last six months have been signed either by the Commandant) Superintendent of Po!iee f or Accounts Officer. The correctness of the pay bill io considered the responsibility of the Accounts Officer but so far as I can see he possesses no means whatever of checking the bill.He possesses s no authoritative information regarding promotions) reductions) dismissals) appointments and obtains all this/t this from the Lines Clerk* An example of the Account* Officer*e Inability to check the bill Is the fact- that no one could explain why the number of pays drawn in !)ul Kaj 1358 was € more than the number drawn in Dal (&amp;ad* I was Informed that no appoint ments had been made over this period and certainly no record of any appointments was available. In addition many entries in the bill were in pencil and many had altered, the names of men who had been beerydischarged were still shown, payments to the I-dnee .)h©M and barbers vere not entered although their thumb impressions had been taken, and receipts of deductions made for pearling debts, issues of clothing, fines etc., were in mapy cases missing. Under such a system it is clear the door is wide open for evory sort of malpractice and I should be surprised if the opportunity has not been made use of. Contingent bills are also often unsigned but are not passed for payment by the Accounts Officer unless supported by vouchers. For some reason the bill Is filed with the General Police Files and the vouchers detached and filed separately. Pay is disbursed by the Accounts Officer and I was present at the disbursement for the month of Muharram* A number of men disputed deductions made from their pay on account of clothing issues made on payment. Clothing issue vouchers were examined and these also were unsigned, undated and in pencil. Orders for all store equipment, etc., are of course made from this office but so far as I could see articles received have not been checked before payment has been made. Thus some 260 rifles recently received from the B.3.A. factory in England which have been paid for/for are still in the packing oases in which they were shipped. There is also no eheck that such articles have been entered in the stock register. Office or the J»perlntend«nt of Police . The Superintendent of Police has an office at the Fort which forme* the Lines and Headquarters of the Police Force. He has one clerk to assist him. This clerk also maintains all the Lines records. The records of this office were in same confusion and it was difficult to find any system or any indication as to what records were meant to be kept here | at the Adviserate, or at the Police station. I found two cup-boards stacked with Jumbled papers some of which had been eaten by ants and some of which were almost illegible through mould. They consisted of such things as correspondence concerning driving licences, undated lists of men eligible for good conduct pay* receipts for clothing allowance recoveries, warrants of commitment, orders from the Commandant, old driving licences a Ians and miscella neous petitions and letters. They bore no indication of any action having been taken on them. There is no correspondence register. The Superintendent of Police maintains no crime register and there are no criminal records in this office. I could find no distribution statement showing the sanctioned strength of the force. The order book is very incomplete and many of the orders are unsigned and undated. There are no schedules of training. runishmenta and JlBCipUne. All punishments are dealt with summarily. The Superintendent of Police has opened an orderlyroom 3?egi3ter In ^hich all punishments Inflicted by lilm are entered* Hia powers of ptmishment liave not been defined, but the following have been inflicted by him i- 1 * ^ixtra parade drill 2 * Confinement to lines 3* Loss of good conduct pay for periods up to one year 4. Fines up to Hs*5/- 6 * Reduction b* dismissal 7* Imprisonment up to two weeks 8 . /hipping up to 16 laahes* *4 tfith the exception of dismissal it appears that any of these punishments may be combined with any other* Thus on 3 - 8 - 39 one Balal bin Rashid was sentenced to a fortnights imprisonment, loss of his good conduct pay and 16 lashes* It is not clear whether there is a right of appeal to the Commandant, and ao far as I can see no punishment orders Issued by the Superintendent of Police have been modified or reversed by the Commandant* Since the appointment of Shaikh Khalifah as 3uperint*nd*nt of Police and the institution of a daily orderly room, punishments have been fairly frequent* Since July of last year 138 men have been punished by the Superintendent of Police and of these cases 13 were direct insubordination to won~C&lt;Mn/&lt;i 3 - sioned Officers, 6 concerned criminal acts (mostly stealing) and the majority of the remainder, absence from parade or duty and slackness while on sentry duty. Prior to the appointment of Shaikh Khalifah severe punishments were leas frequent, so far as can be seen from the records that exist* Punishments inflicted by the Superintendent of Police have not been/been entered in punishment sheets kept for each man* I am informed that the Bahrain Courts refuse to take cognisance of complaints either civil or criminal against Police officers* 'rom the record of punishjaents f the standard of parade, my inspection of the Police Station and posts, and from the difficulties experienced when extra duties were imposed on the Police on the out break of war, X should say that the standard of discipline can be described only as fair* Discipline cannot be maintained if men know that supervision is not constant or thorough and that corrupt practices go unchecked. Investigating officers, the Lines Staff and particularly the Lines Clerk seem to have had a fairly free hand in the past, with the knowledge that their work would never be inspected, and this can only have had a very bad effect on discipline* The reputation of the Lines i Clerk is particularly bad, and although, with the records in the present state, it would probably be difficult to establish a case against him, I consider that there can be little doubt that he has been guilty of corruption and embezzlement. I/Sfive. Leave is sanctioned by the Superintendent of Police or Commandant* There is no limit to casual or medical leave which are on full pay* Leave is earned at the rate of 1 $ months psr year and usually granted after to years service.

There is no one in separate charge of the lines* The Senior Havildar f Nadir Khan f is in charge of parades* transfers* range practices and the issue of rations* The issue of anas and anmunition is in the hands of an illiterate N#C*0* and the Lines Clerk appears to deal #ith all other matters* In addition to Havildar Nadir Khan there are 2 drill instructors 'both of whom are Indians* They are responsible for the training of recruits* Bulla in,' 3 . Buildings are on the whole good especially the new barracks* There are however* one or two criticisms • The armoury is inadequate far the number of rifles* There is no proper room fer the Quarter Guard* There is no separate magazine* all ammunition being kept in the Armoury. The lower room of the new tower which la be’ng built in the North-East comer of the Fort is* I understand* to be used as an armoury. This is out of the sight of the Quarter Guard sentry* The Quarter Guard has no lock-up and policemen punished with confinement are sent to the jail cells* Although they are usually placed in a separate cell and do not work with the prisoners* I consider this most undesirable* Most of the married men in lines live in 'barastia” close to the fort* 12 married quarters have recently been built and when funds are available it is hoped that more will be constructed. J&amp;crul&amp;g* There are at present 30 recruits* Recruits are enlisted at different times and are placed on duty at the Jail until there are sufficient to form a aquad for training* Recruits/These Recruits are In t^o squads, one containing 18 men and the other 12. Those in the first squad haire done 3 months 1 training and those in the second 2 months. Their training lasts for 6 months. These squads arc in charge of Indian instructors *ho keep their o m progreumne. There is no examination at the end of the training but each is supposed to pass a musketry test before being drafted into the ranks* Men who have failed, however, have been kept in the Police. During musketry training each man fires 160 rounds. The first part of the course consists of a practice at short range (25 yards). The miniature rifles being all unserviceable this practice is fired with .303 ammunition. The second part and the test take place in the open range. The test consists of grouping at 100 , application at 200 , sharp shooting at 200, and application and rapid firing at 300. In addition to musketry, recruits are trained in th * 1 following subjects:- Squad drill, Rifle excercise, extended order drill, bayonet fight ing and guard duty. UiiQ, Pypmsms* There is no written Time Table in Lines but the following appears to be the programme 6 a.m. reveille, 6*30 - 8*30 parade, 8*30 Orderly room, 9.15 relief for guards are marched off, 9.30 meal, 3.15 to 4.15 games and parade for recruits, 5.30 meal, 6.00 retreat, 7*00 roll call, 9.15 first poet, 10.00 last post, 10.15 lights out. Parade. All men present at the Lines attend morning parade. Sections are in charge of Non-Commissioned Officers/-41-— X/ 1 &amp; Officers *ho are responsltle for the training carried cut. These Uon-Commiasicned Officers for the most were part have not been instructed themselves since they / recruits, and those I saw in parade were not impres sive. Parades are under the general charge of the Senior Kavildar (radir Khan) • The Superintendent of Polios attends parade twice a week. Physical, Twining * itecruits are given physical training only twice a week. The reraaining sections on parade are instructed in physical training every other day. The time alloted is three quarter of an hour from 6.30 to 7.16. Physical training carried out as at present can have little beneficial effect. The main fault lies with the instructors who for the most part can neither instruct nor demonstrate. Apparatus wore was particularly feeble. Ho physical training tables exist. There is no parade state showing the number of men posted at the Fort, the number on parade and the number sick or absent for other reasons. As has been stated there are no schedules of training. There is no training in bethi fighting, or fire control for dispersing nobs. There is no training in Police work. Certain men were recently selected for training in traffic duty and were instructed by the Superintendent Police for 3 days and then sent on point duty. The first man on point duty I spoke to informed me that he had taught himself. ;iach man fires a yearly musketry course which/which consists of the same open range practices aa fir^d by recruits. Results do not aprear to be particularly good for the number of rounds fired. I examined the scores of 66 men who had fired their last years*a course and of these 26 only had passed, rhe score required for a pass is less than 50$ of the possible. School .

I was also Informed that the 1908 ammunition used to be issued to Nature but that it had now been withdrawn.

The only Police record of a case is a brief report of the facta entered in the forma*/and copied into a com plaints register. Knowledge of the law and procedure applicable to foreigners la very scanty as neither of the HavIldars knows sufficient English to be able to read the Itngllsh copy of the Criminal Procedure Code in the Police station. The Superintendent of Police visits the Police Station every day and discusses cases with the Investigating Officers but with no record of what has taken place investigatIona cannot be properly directed. It may be noted that all complaints civil or criminal are in the case of Bahrain subjects recorded in the police station and reported to the court. Civil cases are not investigated. There is no police station daily diary. There is no proper correspondence register but only one in which copies of letters issued from the proper Police station are entered. There is no^/crime register 9 prevlous convictions being dealt with by local knowledge,there is no register of police station property,stolen property and jail property. There are no records of standing orders, charge notes,minutes by offleers or history sheets of notorious bad characters. i uch records as there are are maintained by two policemen. One is responsible for case reports and bail bonds and maintains the complaintsregi 8 ter 8 # and the second keeps a register of summons received,makes entries in the register of letters issued from the police station and maintains the lock up register. The records are in a state of confusion* Papers Jumbled together in cup boards contained such things as letters to Havlldars asking them to frightehservants alleged to have been abusive, receipte for sums recovered in execution proceedings alans,medical reports,certificates of fitness to drive motor vehicles,recovery 11 ste,complaints petitions,bail bonds and 6 warrants of arrest Issued by the District Court in 19SB* Case/ reports are numbered serially and files closed yearly* Until very recently the results of cases were never recorded* sigf. Disposal orders on case property are not always obtained and amongst other items X found a package containing jewelry which no one knew any thing about and which had been in the police stat ion for over 7 years. Case property is not marked with the brief details of the case in which it has been recovered. There being no other agency,the police deal with attachment and sale orders from Bahrain and Agency Courts. It is s recognised practice for xx persona unable to pay the whole amount decreed against them to execute documents in the Police station for payment by instalments* Fines in criminal cases are often collect ed for the Bahrain Courts. A note may be made here of the system of(of accounts In the police at at Ion .Expenditure shown in monthly bills which ere sent to the Fort for payment from the permanent advance .There may however be occasion in which immediate payment is required. The police station has no permanent advance and payment in such cases ia made by borrowing from sums collected as fines or in execution of decrees. Thus on 16th Dul Hej an order was received from a Bahrain court directing the police to sell property to the value of *** 14/- in execution of a decree passed against one Said Qathan bin Said Naeer. The decree holder and judgement dl^etor appeared in the police etation on the 24 Bui Haj and executed a document agreeing to the payment of ^ 3/- per week. 4® 8 /- had been paid and only ^ 6 /- was present in the police station. The remainder I was informed had been 9 spent for urgent requirements by the police. amongst the envelopes containing money collected in this way were several purses containing money and other valuable belonging to prisonere in the Fort Jail. Enquiry produced the explanation that if such things were sent to the Fort the prisoners would never sed them again. L CK UP. This lock up is used both as a police station lock up and judicial lock up requires much improvement. Besides being filthy,it appears that nothing except food is provided for prisoners or suspects. There ere no blankets and those who are not looked after by their friends have to sleep on stone floor. There Is no limit to the number of person who may be confined. Although the cost of rations for the police has risen from ** 6 /- to ^ 9 /*% per head per month eince war was declared the sanctioned payment for prieonera diet ia atill -/2/~ per head per day# In my opinion it ia quite im post ible to feed a man properly on euch a sum when allowance ia made for the profit of the contractor# In many caeca additional supplies of food are brought by frienda and relatione# Two registera are maintained for the lock up t one for the purpoee of calculating the number of prisoner© fed from day to day and the second shows the date of entry and release or removal of prisoners with brief details of their cases .Both these registers have been recently introduced. It^ worth recording that the greatest complaint against the police appears to be the illegal use of this lock up. It is said that persona are often detained for long periods without tra^. 1 . I could find no cases worthy of special mention from the register. It would however not be difficult to omit an entry in the register especially as it appears that inspections are never made. Under trial prisoners may be in the lock up for a month or more but there is no provision for their being allowed out for exercise. Smoking is apparently allowed without restriction as the floor was littered with cigaretta ends. BAIL . I i There is no bail bond fora.

The police at Hcdd carry out the only ni?cht patroling done by the police in the whole of Bahrain, Patrols are carried out between the hours of 10 p.m, and 1 a,m. by a party consisting of 3 men and one natur. Arm* were in a satisfactory condition but ammunition again included 29 rounds of Mark 6 , Beds are the property of the men and brought with them from the Fort, No lathis are kept at this poet and the only two handcuffs were used on the door of the lock up and the box containing ammunition.Before considering any changes required in the present police adminatratlon it is necessary to state clearly the duties which the police may be required to perform. They appear to be as follows s- 1 . The protection of Bshrain against tribal attacks from the mainland 2. The suppression of internal disturbances. 5. The prevention and investigation of crime. 4. The provision of Guards of Honour on ceremonial occasions. Serious crime in Bahrain is very small and internal disturbances sevrol and it is clear that the main duties of the police are of a more military than civil nature. For this reason such training as is given is on military lines and the force has been organised on a military basis. Men of the type en* listed practically all of them illiterate 9 cannot be expected to assimilate a knowledge of both military subjects and police work*and it is therefore,not surprising that the standard of police work is very low. ^ hat little knowledge those at present employed in case workk&amp;ve of law,procedure and methods of detection,they have taught themselves. IKAiam,. The division of the force into sections in command of Non Commissioned Officers is an obvious necessity for the performance of the military side of police duties,but such an arrangement causes end less difficulties in posting and control as far ae men required for purely police purposes are concer ned • The obvious solution to remove these/0? r j dlffioulties is to divide the force into a / detachment of Armed ‘ Hit ary Police and o body of v ivil police* The armed rfilitery Police would be trained in military lines. They would perform the let and 4th of the duties already enumerated and in addition would form a first armed reserve ready to come to the asaietance of the police in ahy aituetion which had become beyond their control* Men of the civil police would he taught only that amount of acmad drill # rifle excerciee musketry etc. which a polic«Han ia required to know and greater concentration would be made in police subjects auoh »e lathi fighting,method* of diepersing mobe # duties and powers of a police officer^elementory law and procedure,traffic control,detect ion of crime,procedure in caaee of accident etc.etc. Conditions o service,syatems of promot ion,pay and allowances should be the same in both forces but a distinctive uniform should be evolved for die mil it cry police* The command of both forces would rest with Superintendent of Police,under the general direction of the Commandant* ESTIMATED CTEKWPT K RECUIHED P 1 R CIVIL AND MILITA RY CXVIju * 1 estimate the strength of the force required to police Bahrain to be one Inspector three eub-Inspectore, 11 Hevildare, 16 Naiks, 20 V ifaiks, and 141 men* The constitution of the force is shown in the distribution statement below and may be # compared with the present strength shown st pageCIVIL tnepcctor Cub-Inapector H«ad Conatablee m vl » 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 20 12 b 4 6 5 2 1#Police Statione (a) Manama ) (b) Muharrak ) 1 4*.

A different nomenclature for the ranks of the civil police is desirable and I suggest they be called inspectors,cub Inspectors 9 Head Constables, 1st,2nd and 3rd class and Constables. Before examining these estimates it is necessary to decide at this stage whether the preeen* system of maintaining watchmen or Nature should be continued or whether the Civil Police should assume their duties.!he system of Neturs being responsibletor watch and ward at night has baen In operation tor a large number of years and has on the whole worked very satisfactorily and with some readjust ments of the relations between police and Nature a further improvement should be possible.Politically the system has advantages and ay own view is that at any rate for the present the arrangement should continue. I recommend the establishment of a separate Police Station at ttoharrak whose jurisdic tion should cover the Island of Moharrak and the Saghirs islets of Uma-Shajar al Kabira and Al */ This police station should be incharge of a sub-inspector who would also control the operations of police of Hedd and the Nature.The police station at ^anamah for which a larger staff has been provided should have jurisdiction over the whole of the remainder of Bahrain and would control the police poets at Awall and the refinery and Nature. 'ihe Superintendent of Police will have a great deal of work in attending to the internal adminstration of the Armed — Military Police and the civil police and in my opinion he will require an officer to aasiat him. I have there fore euggested the creation of a poat of Inspector whose main duties would be (i) to act as second in command to the Superintendent of Police (&amp;) the examination of cases which investigation officers have left aa untraced and (s) the checking of the files of oases ready for prosecution.Ha could also be assigned such duties as the investigation of important cases in which kuropeens wort involved, the control of the traffic police and of any cases which concern ships at sea. Hs should prepare aa weekly report which would include(l) of crime showing cases reported,under investigation and sent for trial*(&amp;) a statement of cases disposed of by the courts showing the result of each case and reasons for failure to secure convictions* Hie repor* could if necessary be extended to include observa tions on public opinion f youth movements etc* The suggested strength of the police stations has been worked out on the following basis* MANAMA* kttb Inspectors Head Conetablea Conatablea. let Cl.

I have therefore recommended the establishment of a Line Officer of the rank of Cub-Inspector. He should be made responsible to the Superintendent of Police for the discipline,good conduct and training of all men of the civil police atattoned in Lines or on standing guards. He should supervise and control the work of the Lines establishment and be respons ible for the correctness of the accounts. He shouldx! be incharge of all clothing,equipment,arms and ammunition,tents and stores kept at Head quarters and every half year should take stock of all Govern ment property in possession of the Civil and Armed Police Forces. He should visit the police dispensary and ensure that men are receiving proper attention and also exercise a general supervision over the running of the messes. He should be responsible for the train ing of the recruits of the Civil Police for musketry instructions and range practices,for constant inspections of all buildings for cleanli ness, for seeing that men are not absent from duty without permiebion,for the removal of strangers from the limits of his police lines and for the proper functioning of the Lines School. The keys of the armoury,cash chest and jail should remain in his personal custody. He should also be reeponelble for the proper manage ment of the jail. The remainder of the Lines staff should I consider consist of the following :-T &amp; Drill Ineructor Ijin©8 Clerk Clothing and equipment cleric For the maintenance, issue and check of arms and ammunition Total 4 1 Items No* 4,5,6 and 7 in the distribution statement ♦ require no comment* It is essential that the Superintendent of Police should have a separate office in which all records of matters dealt with personally by him can be kept and for this purpose I have provi ded for one clerk of the rank of Head Constable 1st olass and one assistant clerk of the rank of Head constable 2nd class)* These men will be required to deal with records of punishment ,promotions, character rolls* The superintendent of Police should maintain all secret records personally* Provision has also been made for a clerk of the clerical establishment of the Bahrain Government to deal with accounts* In my estimate 1 have provided for a section of camel police and recommended the abolition of the^ Mounted (Horse) Police. The main reason for their establishment was that their speed enabled them to reach quickly the remoter villages in case of necessity* Previously they were also used for petroling • Patrolling was given up as owing to the rough nature of the ground horses were continually going lame and at present the^ section remains constantly at Headquarter* Arab ponies are for too hot to be trained for use again st crowds and I am convinced that the retention of the Mounted Police is not worth the expense* The7^ JW &gt; The northern part of the Island is well roaded and most places c&amp;n be reached by motor car or motorcycle. Villages in the central part of Bahrain can generally be reached by ear and those on the coast by launch. In most cases it would be quicker to send men in a pick-up or lorry to the nearest accessible point to a villageand for the rest of the journey to be oerformed on foot,than for Mounted policemen to be sent from Headquarter. I can see no justification for the posting of police at Hawar. The population of this Island is never more than 160 and during the summer it la almost completely deserted. I have therefore not Included a police post at Hawar in ay proposals. A leave reserve of 26 % for non-commieslor ed officers and 33^ % may seem high but I consider this essential if proper provision is to be made for all non-effectives i.e. recruits,leave,men under training,men sick etc. Leave is at present granted for 3 months every two years end if this is continued, and I see no reason to make any alteration,some 18 Head Constables and men could be on leave at any one time. This would leave acme 26 men to provide for recruits and other non- effectives.ARMED MILITARY ^ICK. oE) J am a dare Kavlldarp Kalka Company 1 No. 1 Platoon No. 2 Platoon Pand - Havildar N a jar Quater Master HarIldar Ordarllea General keserre (85 % of strength) (leave,recruits, aen sick etc.) 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 X Total strength 15 5 ryNalka 4 24 4 24 1 7 • 2 2 14 11 71 I recommend the formation of two platoons of Armed police of the strength shown in the state ment. i^ach platoon should consist of two rifleff an^ two light machine gun sections. The force should be commanded by an officer of the rank of Jamadar-equivalent to that of Sub-Inspector-who would be responsible to the Superintendent of Police and the Commandant for the training conduct end discipline of the men under him* He should be assisted by a Havildar Taj or who would act as second in command and be responsible for training recruits and a Havildar who would deal with all matters concerning equip ment the issue of arms and ammunition and the organisation of supplies when the force is away from Headquarters. The platoon should be organised on ordinary Military Lines with men of the machine gun sections trained in the use of rifle for occasions when automatic weapons are not required. Machine gun sections should be commanded by Nalks with a i/Neik as second in command* Lach platoon should be in charge of a Havildar* It may be noted here that platoons should normally be controlled* - 1*0 S -0 by menbf officer renk but thle has not been recommended as the expense would be beyond the resources of the Bahrain OoTernment.

Pay bills and contingent bills must be prepaired in his office \*here all the records exist for checking i.e. records of promotion, reductions, dismissals, appointments etc. Pay bills and copies of contingent bills etc. must be filed hy the office of the person responsible for the preparation and correctness. To enable the account ant of the Bahrain Government to check such bills would require a duplication of work and in any case he appe rs to have neither the time nor the staff for the work. Bills should be prepared in the office of the Superintendent of Police signed by him in token of their correctness and passed to the Treas ury Accountant, who would onl' be responsible for the correctness of the totals, the presence of the Superintendent Of Police’s sigrat re, his initials on any alterations and erasures and who would see that all increases or reductions in and deductions from pay are accompanied by the number and date of the order in the Order Bock. Pay roll should then be signed by the accountant and a su mary of it sent to the Treasury Officer for payment. After payment has been made from the Treasury the receipted summary should be returned to the Accounts Officer for entry in his cash book. All bills prepared by the Superintendent of Polic should show the Budget Head under which *hoy are to be d awn and a general cash register for monetary receipts and expenditure must be kept by him. A second register showing the monthly expend! ure under the v riJJoyB heads should be maintained and receipt and voucher forms should be kept at the office. I * IIt must, be emphasised that the transfer to tl Superinten ient of Police of only routine expendijfcure is suggested and the control of major works such as buildings, clothing and equipment orders etc must remain in the hands of the Commandant. I suggest however that the Superintendent of Police be supp lied with full details of the sanctioned budget est imates and expenditure controlled by the Connandant. The object of this general proposal is to give the Superintendent of Police real responsibility which in ay view is only possible if finance is to some extent dealt with by him. The details of procedure should be worked out by the Accounts Officer of the Bahrain Government. The disbursement of pay for both the civil and Armed Military Police should be carried out by the Lines Officer. Permanent advances of not more than is.100/- for Lines and ns.60/- t or Police stations should be sancti* oned f expenditure from which should be controlled by the Superintendent of Police. The Accountant in the of ice of Superintendent of Police should be a member of the clerical estab lishment of the Bahrain Government experienced in Accounts work. Petty repairs should be dealt with by the Sup erintendent of Police and a definite allotment made for the purpose, ajor projects should be dealt with by the Comman lant. The records of all Police officers above the rank of Havaldar should be kept by the Coranandant. These should include character rolls showing date of appointment , age, origin i.e. Persian, Bah aini etc. Educational qualifications, details of promotions, punishments and leave and mention of any specially good work done or rewards received.si In addition each officer should have a personal file in which all correspondence affecting him per sonally should be filed* 3uch correspondence should include leave applications and orders, the record of any departmental proceedings against an officer, medical reports and such like matters* The power to punish , pro ote, reduce or dismiss, to grant leave, sanction increments and to transfer of icers will rest with the co- mandant* I recommended the framing of plans for action to be adopted for Moharram, serious disturbances in the jail, the disposal of unlawful assemblies and the general mobilisation of Naturs and men available from the civil police in the event of serious internal disturbances* Copies of such plans should be kept both in the office of the comnandant and the Superin tendent of Police* Standing orders should be issued by the Comm andant only and should be numbered serially, copies being kept in both the offices* The Commandant must be kept informed of the occurrence, progress of investigation and ^‘in 1 re sult of all important cases and information by tele- p one is not su fic ent* When a case of the category shorn in the ixxmm list below is reported, the Superintendent of Police and the Commandant must be informed by t lephone (at present there is no telephone in the houOe of the Superintendent of Police and its installation should be carried out without ffiKKX delay)• A copy of the first information report should be sent to the Superintendent of Police who should make out a report in Pnglish for submission to the Commandant* Continuation reports should be submitted until the case has been finally disposed of .The eases which should be specially repo arei- 1* Offences committed by Europeans and Americans* 2* Cases of unnatural or sudden deaths of persons of importance and Europeans and Americans* 3* Counterfeiting coins* 4* Theft of flre*»arms* 5* All serious charges against the police. 6* Robbery with murder or grevious hurt* 7* Murder or attempted murder* 8* Cases of clashes between utiropeans and Americans and the local inhabitants* 9* Rioting. 10* Escapes from Police custody. robbery of Government treasuries* 12% Other cases which through special circumstances may be of importance* Files containing special reports should be kept in both offices* Crime reports by the Inspector should be for warded to the Commandant for information and after any action, thought necessary has been taken on them they should be returned to the Superintendent of Police for filing*Office of the Superintendent of Police. 1.

The postings of men up to and including Head Constables 1st Class must be dealt with personally by the Superintendent of Police and not left to the discretion of subordinates. Separate register should be maintained for each rank and in case of men a table of rotation of duties should be laid down with the period assigned for each post away from Head Quarter/. Postin/ for the civil police may present some difficulty owing to the absence of married quart ers at Police Stations or posts. Under the present system it is possible to allow men to remain at Headquarters for a large portion of the year as out of 26 sections not more than seven are posted away from Head (Quarters and the remainder are available for general duties. Sections sent for duty at the Police Station only remain there for 24 hours and spend the next day at the Fort where thay are free for duty after attending morning parade. Men complain bitterly if kept away from their families and until married quarters have been provided at Police Stations and posts periods of duty will have to be short. Rotation should be on the following liness- 1. Recruits course. 2. Police Station. 3. Head Quarters (Jail Guards and Standing Guard) 4. Police Post. (Jedda f Awali t Refinery, Hedd.) 5. Head quarters. 3. Schedules of training for recruits and men of both branches of the forces, for traffic police and for N.C.Os, Heal Constables and selected for promo tion should be made out by the Superintendent of Police and submitted for the approval of the Comman dant. For this purpose I recoct end the purchase oof copies of the Punjab Police Manualf training Vol* 1 and Infantry Training. 4. (a) The selection of recruits is a matter of gXit great importance with which I consider the Comm andant should deal personally in consultation with the Superintendent of Police. I suggest that recruit ment should take place four times a year at the Office of the Superintendent of Police. Dates should be fixed and public notified. All men applying for enlistment during the year should be first measured by the Sup erintendent of Police and if up to the standard their particulars should be taken and entered in a register and they should be told the date on which to appear before the Commandant. This register should have a column for the orders of the Commandant and the result of medical examinations. The following form is sugg ested. Hocrults Register. Serial Name Hesld- Nation- Age. Height. Chest Orders Medl- If enroll- No. and ence. allty. measu- of cal ed date M father*s rement. Comman- re- of enroll- name • dant. port. ment. The minimum ef height should be fixed at 5 feet six inchesjtmd chest measurements 32 inches with an ex pansion of two inches. The age limit should normally be 25 but this should be relaxed at the discretion of the Commandant. In order to obtain if possible men of good family and education amongst N.C.Os of the Civil Police, I recommend that a certain proportion be re cruited directly to the rank of Head Constable 1st class.This proportion should not exceed 2/5th of the total strength of this rank. It is a matter of foremost importance that eff orts be made to attract a better class of men to the police forci who would command respect and who would also be fit for promotion to the rank of Sub-Inspector The two chief obstacles in the way of this are I think public opinion and conditions of service. Arab publicvery raueh against the Police and views with particular disfavour the fact that practically all the important posts in the force are held by Indians and Persians* The elimination of all Indian influences is in my view particularly important and an effort should be directed towards improving the relations between the public and the police by lectures on behavlour 9 in creased efficiency in dealing with criminal complaints and above all the stricter control over all ranks to prevent the abuse of prlviliges* Men of the class of manumitted slaves can obviously netoer command respect from the people and they should be totally eliminated from the civil police* As regards conditions of service 9 pay and allowan ces have been dealt with separately but in addition to this living conditions require improvement* Senior N*C*Os and officers must be provided with proper quar ters in which to live and work f men must be given proper beds to sleep in and boxes in which to keep their kit and other belongings* I feel sure that the right men for all ranks could be found if a recruiting drive in both towns and vill ages were instituted with the assistance of members of the Ruling Family f the educational Department and the local newspaper* If the changes recommended are brought into effect it should be possible to popularise the Police Force as (1) pay would compare favourably with that offered for other forms of employment f (2) it provides pennanant employment with free food 9 clothing and accomodation and t most important of all 9 in view of the high promotion of N*C*Os to men 9 it offers Immense chances for promotion* The appointment of XXX a member of the Ruling Family as Superintendent of Police has done a great deal to increase the prestige of the Police and as soon as the right X&amp;QI type of'-V 4ii&gt;) type of men has been secured for the officer and Havildar ranks a further improvement will follow. The selection and appointment of directly re cruited Havildars let clans should rest with the Commandant who would o^our^e consult the Superinten dent of Police* A register of candidates on the lines of the recruiting register should be maintained in the office of the Superintendent of Police. I see no objection in enlisting men for any de finite period. Resignations should be allowed at the discretion of the Commandant and Superintendent of Police after two months * notice or in the case of failure to give notice t the deposit of two months’ pay. Age limits might be laid down for each rank which could be relaxed only on the approval of the Commandant. A scale of punishments should be laid down showing the powers of officers to inflict them and the right of appeal if any. A suggested scale is belowt- Inspector. Sub- Inspector Jamadar.

Ail poiic* men promoted in rank should b* on probation for one year and ii ble to rtversion for un sat i factory conduct, without departmental proceedings.

It is essen tial particularly in the case of the civil police that men be given in incentive to serve a greeter period than four years if the time spent in their training is not to be wasted. It is true that the high proportion ox js.C.Os to men .n the proposed forces should provide considerable incentive but it is uniix iy to be less thru four yecra before a man is promoted and in the c^jg of an ilriterate man in the civil -once it mi^ht be muen longer.

Hit yyii.it rates for men ere slightly less then before in the c se of men staying for short perioas only but become better th&lt; n the present rate for men remaining in service for over stven ye rs.

(i) No one in Lines knew who was in charge of the Jail and it is eioenti&amp;l that there should be an off cer to discharge this important function. It may be possible to eventually procure suflicent funas to build a separate Jail for all short term prisoners with ^ud cial lock-up and ru by e separate Jail st&amp;ff. For the resent, however, control of the Jail must rest with the Police and the Lines Officer should be appointed es officer- in-charge, fils re&amp;^onsiblities should include the maintenance of records, constant inspection and in articular the check of prisoners before they er« locked up for the night. The keys should .4- reme n with him throughout the night and not &amp;s at present with a junior N.C.O. (L) Detailed instructions should be drawn up for the running of the Jail to cover Uie following points, (a) sensibilities of the Oilicer-in-Ciiar fc e unu the HaviL^ar in charge of escorts,records, ments remission of s ntenees, jail punkah-*/ and the method of deal ng with com A laints, restiiction of visitors, iaa ection the State Medical Officer, custody of prisoners*property etc. (c) The Police Station concerned should be notified of t e rele se of six prisoners sentenced for criminal offences.1 .. —W' V '■W Jonfldential* D*0,No.356-S* The Hteidenoy, Buahire, the let June, 1940* //c p Thank you for your demi-official letter lfo«C!/432 of 24th Uhy 1940 and Hallows* very intcreatinj and able report* 1 agree generally with the proposals, but as suggested In paragraph 3 of your letter I doubt If the deficiencies of the Police axe really so very serious* The deficiencies disclosed would probably be found in 80 per cent of Indian States but unlike most Indian States the Bahrain Police usually 'get their man 4 * The fact is of course that the place is so sra*ll, and the charge so insigni ficant* that they would carry on probably quite as wall without any organisation whatever, in fact Kuwait, ifcich is In some ways better run than Bahrain* has no police organize* tlon that 1 know of beyond supplying a few men with uniform I 2.

V/ith reference to your d.o. C/325-8/26-A dated 13th ^pril 1941, I wrote to you on this subject in my No. 550-9 dated 10th April 1941. Alooka was not released on the date on which he should have been released owing uo an error. I saw him myself in jail a few days before the date on which his sentence should have expired. Fe asked for remission and I told him that it would not be granted. Ihe remission would have c?mounted to about 72 days. On the following morning T informed the clerk that Alooka was not to be given the remission which he he had earned. He was kept in custody, wrongly, for an additional 19 days. He has nov; been arrested again. It appears that he stole a coat from one of the people attending the Friday mosque while the owner was washing at the mosque well. Alooka is a habitual thief and a troublesome prisoner, he is a foreign subject, a Persian , and I think he would be a suitable case for repatriation provided that he was warned that he would be severely dealt with if hereturned to Bahrain. I have sent in a list of his previous convictions v/ith my No. 550-9 dat ................. 10th AprilConfidential D.C.No .C/337-4/4.

The fact is that the above individual who ia under the Jurisdiction of this Agency has been impri soned for 19 days by the State, without any order by a ?£agistrste, and without committing any offence. In India such offences by Prison Subordinates are very severely lealt with and it appears that the individual responsible is the Jail Clerk. If such an error can occur once it can obviously have occuraad before and there must be something wrong with the Jail staff if euch things can occur. 3. This clerk is the 'Lines Clerk 11 referred to in Hallows* report on the Police, vide pages 13,16, 27, 28. It appears that he has been drawing pa/ for men who were no longer in service and that his reputation is particularly bod; the report states that 'there can be little doubt that he has been guilty of corruption and embezzlement’* • 4.

Bahr-ain, 31st May 1944. i &gt; Zuy/fr/uL sfi' The tremendous demand for skilled and unskilled labour caused by the Refinery construction programme, the R.A.F's (V' building both for the U.S.A.T.C. and themselves, the British Overseas Airways Corporation^ expansion operations, Messrs. Gray Mackenzie &amp; Company f s much increased demands for cooly “\ labour, and the Royal Navy’s building programme, has placed the Bahrain Government in a very embarrassing position. Bahrain Government employees from every department including the Civil Police are leaving their work in order to obtain higher wages and possibly better conditions with any one of the operations enumerated above with the result that the Bahrain Government are finding it increasingly difficult to keep their various departments running. 2. I have endeavoured by means of meetings with employers of labour to ensure that competition among employers is reduced to a minimum but I am afraid my endeavours have not been as satisfactory as could be desired principally owing to the fact that while the heacis of the local Service Com mands and business houses are willing to cooperate their subordinates have got to get their work done and I regret to say they are prepaired to go to almost any lengths to accom plish their purpose. I have just formed a Labour Committee which will hold its first meeting on the 1st of June and I hope that I shall be able to enlist the effective cooperation of labour employers with a view to ensuring that when appli cations are made for work very careful examination of the The Hon’ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., /applicant’s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.2. (&amp;£) applicants credentials will be carried out with a view to making quite sure that he is not already employed on essential work. Even assuming that the fullest cooperation is obtained I am afraid that as regards the Bahrain Civil Police we shall not be able to attain our object which is to ensure that the Police Force is maintained at effective strength for many of the policemen now completing the period of service for which they were engaged are desirous of obtaining employment as semi skilled artisans in the town itself and not with any of the / large employers of labour. 3. I have suggested to BMgrave that he should examine the desirability of the Bahrain Government issuing an ^lan making police service compulsory until the end of the war for all persons at present enrolled in the Civil Police Force. Belgrave is much in favour of compulsory service and has I understand represented very strongly to His Highness the desirability for some such order but the Shaikh is not favourably inclined. The , A1 Khalifah family have always disliked compulsion and much prefer persuasion. It has been their policy to pla cate delinquents, especially should they be members of the family, by increasing their allowances or making them gifts, a policy which has so far never succeeded, I understand that His Highness is no exception to this rule and would much prefer to increase the wages of the Police to such a level that they would continue willingly to serve. The Police are in my opinion at the present time in receipt of a reasonable wage especially when it is considered that they receive full rations and uniform and I feel that ^o grant them an increase in wages because of the fear of their leaving their employment would only be storing up trouble for the future. I append as an appendix to this letter a sche dule showing the present pay, allowances, and rations of a police constable and a police sergeant. It is worthy of /note3 no-o that, the police alone receive a rice ration and that their total cereal ration is twice as /nuch as a civilian adult ration* 4* Belgrave with whom I had a further discussion on the 30th of May is continuing his efforts to persuade His Highness to change his attitude towards compulsory police service but I am not hopeful of his success. It may therefore be neces sary for me to take the matter up with His Highness in the near future and before doing so I shall welcome an expression of your opinion on the subject. If you are not in accord with my views then there is no more to be said and I shall naturally take no action while if you are in favour of com pulsory police service with a possible immediate further increase in emoluments to sweeten the pill then I shall be fortified and strengthened when I approach His Highness.BSSHfewm VA CONFIDENTIAL D.O.

I regret to have to inform you that the police force is slack and slovenly and little or no attempt is made to correct matters, they are at least as susceptible to bribes as other police forces in the Middle East, and the incidence of undetected crime continues to rise in spite of my energetic representations to Belgrave. The reasons for this are two fold, firstly in Belgrave’s eyes the police can do no v/rong and he is sentimentally averse to punishing constables and N.C.Os, even when the proof of their neglect of duty is so clear that even he must accept it, secondly the Civil Police are inadequately staffed. 3. I consider that the time has come when Belgrave should sever his direct connection with the Police and leave the dis cipline and administration of the Force to Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammed interfering as little as possible in police affairs and being careful not to undermine Shaikh Khalifah’s position by encouraging appeals against his orders. Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohammed may not be an ideal choice for the post of Com mandant of Police but he is much more efficient and better trained than any other Arab of good family on this side of the Persian Gulf and he should be allowed to see what he can do unhampered by Belgrave^ over-riding authority and physical appearance on parade. Let the Adviser fulfil his function and give good advice, if the advice is not taken and it manifestly should be then pressure can be brought to bear to ensure that it is. - 'J The Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushire.

Dot CS'i mu ; COktlTiUci* l ml- lwtXX)i»US. • *2 Unrortunately I loam from recent conversations with Belgrave that he is most disinclined to sever his connection with the police even to the extent which I have suggested. In view of his very stubborn attitude I do not feel that I should be justified in saying more to him than I have already but shall be grateful if you will raise the subject with him on your next visit to Bahrain. Shaikh Khalifah is honest though handicapped by powerful and dishonest relatives and I feel that he is be coming disgruntled from continually playing second fiddle. It is a pity. 4. It is not the time to think of re-organising the Police Force but two or three trained policemen of head constable or sub-inspector rank are essential and urgently required owing to police commitments having increased during the war years due in the main to military activities and essential war construction works resulting in an increase in the floating population. The Force is particularly short of detectives and it has occurred to me that the Palestine Police might be able to come to our assistance and lend us two or three men on deputation, men who would benefit from a change to a less disturbed part of the world. If this were not possible could enquiries be made to dis cover if there are any retired men from the Palestine Police who would suit our purpose and who would be willing to come to Bahrain on contract for say two years and if so what financial remunera tion they would expect ?vn 17 ^ No. 2230-S/:2 T'aq Political I r ^- O r&gt; I ,J/i&gt; l-fjtl44J&gt;x \jGnt, Bahrain, presents his conplinents to:~ m ho 'lon , hlG the Political and has the honoufc to send hiri docunont for necessary action, prepared to boar tlio expenses in Nasik. a copy of the ondermentioned fhe Bahrain dovemnent are incidental to the training The igency, ■Bahrain, Persic.n Nulf bated 6 th \uyust 1944. deference to previous correspondence: This Y ;ency letter No-. 626-6/2, la ted the 16th Ipril 1939.

I suggest that I be permitted to correspond directly with the Commissioner of Police in Sindh with a view to discover ing whether or not he would be prepared to undertake the instruction of Bahrain Policemen and if so what the cost, etc., would be.

There is an evident danger that with this example before their eyes the minds of the smaller Arab rulers may be turned increasingly in the direction of Ibn Sand as the greatest Arabian figure, and that their fear of Wahabi absorption may be le® than their fear of losing their local and Arab individuality in exchange for an uncongenial western regime, however efficient and profitable that regime may be. 3.

C. L. de Grenier in his present appointment of Director of Customs, Bahrain. 2. Mr. de Grenier has a contract for an indefinite period terminable at three months notice from either party. M502FD2 3. When I went to Bahrain as Political Agent in September 1926, Mr. de Grenier was under a cloud and I gave particular attention to observing his work. I found it to be of excellent quality. Mr. de Grenier, while enforcing the State regu lations, went out of his way to be tactful and obliging to the merchants with whom he had dealings, and is now deservedly popular with them. At the same time, owing to his honesty and sense of duty, he commands the respect of Shaikh Hamad. 4. While declining to admit that the Government of India would be responsible for any decrease in the customs revenues of Bahrain consequent on the removal of Mr. de Grenier from his appointment, I strongly recommend that His Excellency Shaikh Hamad’s wish to retain Mr. de Grenier’s services be respected and request that I may be authorised to inform the Shaikh that His Majesty’s Government have no objection to the retention of Mr. de Grenier’s services. Enclosure. Copy of letter No. C.-74, dated the 22nd May 1929, from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to letter No. 5-S., dated the 19th January 1929 from the Hon'ble the Political Resident to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India [Serial No. (159) in File No. 145-N./28], and to say that I have received a letter from His Excellency Shaikh Hamad stating that he wishes to retain Mr. C. C. L. de Grenier in his present appointment. 2. His Excellency says that when Sir Denys Bray was in Bahrain he did not mention the matter to him (cf. notes pages 7 and 8 ibid), and it was onlv after ho had left that the order of Government to dispense with the services of either Mr de Grenier or Captain Parke was given him (cf. notes pages 9 and 10). He feels that the Government of India have not considered the harm which will result from this order, and he says that the only reason that he gave Mr. de Grenier notice was that he was unmarried and on leave in England, while Captain Parke was married and in Bahrain. 3. He further states that Mr. de Grenier has been in his employ for five years and during that time he has seen every year an increase of revenue, and a great in crease from the days when it was farmed out to Hindus. If Mr. de Grenier does not remain in his post, he does not.agree to hand over the work to anyone else as none of his own subjects are qualified, and the appointment of another foreigner such as a Hindu will cause complaints and also a loss in revenue. 4. He concludes by saying that the work of the Customs occupies one man fully, and that the two posts of Adviser and Customs Director cannot be combined : that all the revenues of the State come from the Customs, and that their supervision is of the greatest importance. He feels sure that Government do not wish to involve his state in loss, and that for this reason he informs me that Mr. de Grenier will remain at his post of Director of Customs as he is pleased with him and his hard work for his State. Finally, he says “ If the Government of India want a change in the appoint ment of (labud) course they will make up any deficiency in the revenues, and we request Your Excellency to explain this matter to the Government of India ”. 5. As Sir Frederick Johnston pointed out to the Government of India in the letter quoted above, it would be impossible to combine the posts of Adviser and Director of Customs without deterioration. I fully sympathise with the point of view set forth by the Shaikh in his letter, and I feel that it is impossible for the Government of India to go back at this stage on the reforms which they introduced with so much difficulty six years ago, and which have already shown such beneficial results. 6. I do not think it is realised that Mr. de Grenier is responsible (with the reve nue from pearling licenses which he also collects) for the collection of 97 0/ A of the revenues of the State. His revenue work is therefore of the greatest importance for unlike British India there are no revenues from land, excise or income-tax. In fact, he is not only the Director of Customs but also the chief revenue officer It must also be kept in mind that he has now been called upon to do all passport work3 which till recently was of little importance but now requires very strict supervision owing to the difficulties created by the Persian Government. 7. I show below the collections of the customs for the past four years Its. 1344 1345 1346 1347 8,82,000 9,62,000 10,58,000 • • • • • • • • • 10,70,000 (at least, one month to run). It will be seen from these figures that there has been a very considerable improve • meat which has been made without the imposition of any additional taxation, and at an administrative cost of not more than 5 per cent. The improvement in revenue seems to have found more or less its level now, and His Excellency’s claim that Government should guarantee him against loss is perfectly equitable, and I do not see how else they can oblige, him to discharge an employee with whom he is well pleased. 8. It must be rememl)ered that the gradual increase in revenue has been accom panied by an mciease in expenditure. Should i\Ir. de Grenier s departure result in a diminution of revenue, which seems inevitable, the results would be most serious. The allowances of the A1 Khalifa family (on a generous and ever expanding scale) would have to be drastically reduced, involving much discontent among a very in fluential body. Expenditure on public works, education, medical institutions, land registiation, courts and police 5 in fact all the benefits arising from the reforms, would have to be cut down as they are dependent for their existence on the present high rate of customs collections. 9. I confess I can think of no alternative to Mr. de Grenier. A customs officer on deputation would presumably be equally unacceptable to Government, and there is no one in the State, as the Shaikh observes, to replace him. The Hindus to whom the Customs were formerly farmed out proved a failure, and the method itself is objec tionable. An Egyptian or Syrian would probably be less efficient, and my experience of Syrian customs officials leads me to think that they would be less honest. Mr. dc Gremei is well liked by the merchant s and the Shaikh, and, as Sir Frederick pointed out to the Government, residents in the Gulf are well used to seeing foreign advisers employed. • 10. In short, if there be any objection to the employment of Mr. de Grenier, it certainly does not come from EaJirain where his services are appreciated, and if the Government of India, for reasons of policy, arc determined that the Bahrain State should dispense with them, it is only equitable that they should undertake to 'ndemmfy it c gainst the losses which it feels wall 'inevitably ensue. There is no -ed for me to point out that the post was originally a creation, not of the State, but the Government of India and their agents.

C 0N ^^ E ^ TI ^ L the Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel C. C. J. Barrett l.fe.I., C.I.L., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No 385-S DATED THE 28TH AUGUST 1929. , * have i !v- e M 0 n 0Ur i t0 refer t0 y0ur Ietter No ‘ F - 164 - N -/29 of the 28th May 1929 [Serial (1)], asking me to examine the whole question of British interference in the Bahrain administration, with a view to deciding how far it is possible and expedient now to retrace the steps which have been taken. 1 i i u Th / n 1St °Z ° f p he ^ eveIo P men t of our concern in the internal affairs of the Islands is fully set forth in Lieutenant-Colonel Haworth’s No. 295-S. of 1st Sentem- ber 1927, so it is unnecessary to repeat it. 1 I wish, however, to stress the following points i— (a) In 1869 we had installed Shaikh Isa as Ruler of the islands and it was entirely due to our support that he had been able to keep his position ; (b) From 1877 to 1900 we attempted, with our advice, to improve internal conditions but were most concerned about financial conditions and particularly the Customs administration ; (c) Froin 1904, with the appointment of a British Political Agent to Bahrain after the visit of Lord Curzon, our interests in internal matters in creased, and we continued to press Shaikh Isa with good advice. He. however, seemed more concerned with preserving his independence from us, than with conciliating us, by whom only his independence could be maintained ; (d) In 1904, following on riots in which Persians and a German were concern ed and in which Shaikh Isa was first supine and then obstructive, the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, advocated vigorous measures against him as he was ' only encouraged in his obstinacy by our continued forbear- a £ c f. , ' e I ? 0 '^ important results of our intervention were the abolishment of Shukra so far as foreigners were concerned, the banishment to Bombay of the leader of the anti-Persian riots (who was iJiaikn Isa s own nephew), and the assumption by the Political Agent of jurisdiction over foreigners. The Shaikh was reminded of his assmances to follow the advice of the Political Resident. In this case the impossibility of obtaining justice for Shiahs from the Sunni Qadhis was brought to notice.In connection with these events Major Cox reported :— “ I do not see how we can expect anything but periodical trouble from a continuation of our laudable endeavours to carry on the Gov ernment of the islands through the rule of a chief, who has shown himself to possess few, if any, of the qualifications necessary for the maintenance of order, the security of persons and of trade he was accordingly in favour of stronger measures but His Majesty’s Government decided that the amelioration of the internal govern ment should be sought by indirect and pacific means ; (e) In 1919 Shaikh Abdulla’s interview with Sir Arthur Hirtzel showed how the Ruler chafed against the interference of the Political Agent in the matter of jurisdiction over foreigners and appointments to the Bench of Magistrates. Although the Political Agent possessed these powers, he was powerless to stop misrule ; (f) The gross oppression from which the deposition of Shaikh Isa in 1923 rescued the people—especially the Baharanah, and the opening that thft oppression gave to fpreign nations—especially the Persians and the Wahabis. The oppression is set out in the extracts from Major Daly’s report forwarded to Government under Colonel Trevor’s letter No. 23-S., dated the 8th January 1922 ; {g) Colonel Knox brought to the notice of Government that the whole management of affairs would more and more come into the hands of the Political Agent ; (h) With an uneducated Arab independence means the power to do many things of which we do not approve. It means administering the islands for the sake of the Chief of the tribes, exploiting the people for the rulers, and treating the Shiahs as a people of an unprivileged class; (i) Government, and not the Political Agent, finally had to insist on threats instead of advice ; (j) Shaikh Hamad is a pleasant man but weak, and it is idle to pretend he and his brothers would not backslide. To relax too much means to go through the same grind as we have come. 3. Throughout the History of Bahrain during the twentieth century, the fear of interference displayed by the Government of India is apparent. In 1904 they decided “ to pursue a cautions policy Later, the Political Agent was to “ seek the amelioration of the internal government by indirect and pacific means, and by gaining the confidence and trust of the Shaikh. ” In 1922 they “ did not desire to be drawn into interference between the Shaikh and his people “ Government are not prepared to act until they are satisfied all local resources are exhausted ”. Yet it was this Government, who were so obviously and sincerely anxious to avoid interference, which finally had to order the Political Resident to take the steps which led to the deposition of. the Ruler. They never, however, forgot their original policy, and within a couple of months are again warning the Political Agent to be on his guard against being tempted to interfere too much, or to become the administrative officer rather than the adviser. It is obvious that Government did their very best to avoid the action of 1923 ; but it was forced on them by the gross tyranny of the A1 Khalifa, whom Shaikh Isa made no attempt to restrain, and by the pressure of the London Foreign Office, fearful of the reaction in Persia of the oppression of a Shiah population, and because “ misrule would be the only serious flaw in our case if the status of Bahrain and our position in the Islands was brought before the League of Nations 4. The point to remember now is that Shaikh Isa, the Ruler, was not bad natured at heart. Although obstinate in rejecting all advice from the Political Agents as derogatory to his position as an independent ruler, he was easy-going and had a strong dislike for interfering with the actions of members of his family even when these took the form of gross tyranny. The family—the A1 Khalifa—were uneducated savages with a veneer of town manners. The outlook of Shaikh Isa and his family was as is described in paragraph 2 (k) above. Now Shaikh Hamad M0502FDis extremely amiable, with a constitutional disinclination to take strong measures on any subject. Even as a judge, his inclination is to- acquit an obvious criminal and himself to pay a fine imposed. Such a man—except in the fact that he is younger and has seen changes taking place around him and that he is, in conse quence, less conservative—is not to be differentiated from his father. Just as Ids father permitted oppression but did not actively oppress, so would Hamad act. W ith the exception of Shaikh Kb add, all the old oppressors are still alive and will ing to resume their former ways if not repressed. Shaikh Hamad would certainly not repress them if deprived of active British support and direction. To this day his weakness in any matter connected with the A1 Khalifa is pathetic. In ordinary matters also, in spite of the presence in Bahrain of a British adviser, he truckles t° any show of force. In May of this year he reversed a decision he had made the previous day regarding the amount of advance to divers because a mob of two hun dred unarmed men made a clamour in his Majlis. It is certainly better that Shaikh Hamad should govern and make mistakes than that we should govern and make none, but a man of his type, who will not incur the odium of governing, must have an adviser. If the European adviser were removed, Shaikh Hamad would surely fall under the influence of some intriguing Syrian or Egyptian \fho would, for a consideration, play into the hands of Persia or Najd. It was the defencelessness of the Bahrain Government in the face of gang robberies which led to the insti tution of the Indian armed police. These police had to be foreign as the Bahrain Arab was averse from wearing uniform, had an objection to an occupation un connected with boats and disliked binding himself to fixed periods of duty. The armed police are still necessary, but it may be possible to make them less ob- strusively foreign by substituting Sudanese for Indians, directly the contract of the latter expires at the beginning of 1931. Owing to the large number of blacks, descended from slaves domiciled in the islands, the Sudanese would melt into the landscape in a way the Indians fail to do. Mr. Belgrave, the present Adviser to Shaikh Hamad, has experience of Sudanese, having served with them in Egypt during the war. I would have recommended that the present European Comman dant of Police—whose four-year contract expires about the same time—should depart with the Indian policemen at the end of 1930. In view, however, of the pro bability that Bahrain may shortly have to submit to an influx of American and other foreign drillers and oil workers, I do not think it advisable to dispense with the services of a European Commandant of Police unless and until we are satisfied that the threatened invasion—which would certainly include a number of tou^h characters—will not take place. On the analogy of the Anglo-Persian Oil Com- pairy, the Gulf Syndicate would probably start a Security Service of its own, and the Bahrain State will require a European Commandant of Police to deal with it, and with the bad characters attracted by the chance of employment. 5. I turn now to the Customs Department. This was an old bone of conten tion between Shaikh Isa and the Government of India. It was Colonel Mead who first suggested bringing it under control, under the mistaken assumption that Shaikh Isa was really as poor as he pretended when the presence suited him. In any case the question of the Customs Department came for a time to be looked upon as a trial of strength between Shaikh Isa and the Government of India. The old system was to farm out the customs to a Hindu contractor and, as was only to be expected, the revenue accruing to the State was much less than it should have been. This loss was estimated at one lakh of rupees a year, but judging from the yield of the Customs since it has been put under conscientious European control, it must have been considerably more. Customs is the main source of revenue to the State and brought in during the past year Rs. 11,24,679 out of a total of Rs. 12,15,694. The Director of Customs is not only in charge of the department from which he takes his name, but he is also Port Officer and controls the Passports, Regis tration of Boats, and various minor revenue departments. Owing to the lack of natives with sufficient education and honesty to take charge of the various departments, a foreigner must be appointed to control them. At present the head is a European. Is anything to be gained by substituting an Egyptian, Syrian or Iraqian ?7 Fo the untrained eye of an Englishman, an Egyptian might look more indi genous than an Englishman, but to a resident of the Gulf he would still be a foreigner. The Customs is not a political department and in Persia it can be staffed by foreigners without upsetting the political balance; but in a small nation like ^ Bahrain the personality of the man who collects 90 %of the revenues must count for something. As in the case of the Adviser why Jettison a European, who can be trusted, in order to replace him by some foreign Oriental about whose integrity and whose intrigues one can never be sure ? 6. Captain Prior, the present Political Agent at Bahrain, summed up the situation very well in one of his reports to me when he stated that Mr. de Grenier collects the revenues of the State and Mr. Belgrave conserves them. If the effi- ^ cient collector and conserver are removed, what is to happen to a State, which has become accustomed to a far higher rate of public expenditure than ever before in its history ? Not only have the claims of the idle and ever increasing A1 Khalifa been generously met, but for the first time Bahrain has been administered for the good of its people and not merely for the benefit of its ruling family. With a decline in revenue, discontent is sure to return. If the European Adviser were removed, his place would be taken by an Arab from Bahrain—almost certainly ■one of the A1 Khalifa. With the exception of Shaikh Adbulla there is at the mo ment not a single member of the A1 Khalifa fit either by character or education to fill the post. Bahrain in the present day is not such a principahty as those of the Trucial Coast, slumbering in the conditions of the seventh century. Thanks to its geographical situation as the gateway to Najd and to the pearl trade of which it is the centre, it has always been a trading centre, and has attracted to itself a number of foreigners, who are in contact with the outside world. Thanks to the interest taken by the Government of India in 1923, its administration, once a by-word, is now the admiration of the Gulf. The more enlightened citizens of Dubai, for instance, envy Bahrain though the ruling Shaikhs have no desire to copy it. 7. It has repeatedly been said that Bahrain has been westernised too hurriedly. It is necessary to examine this statement for although there is a substratum of truth ^ ‘n it, I think it conveys a wrong impression that all native institutions have been ruthlessly swept away. The reforms instituted in or shortly before 1923 related to— (a) Municipalities. (b) Reorganisation of the Customs department. (c) Institution of a proper Police force. (d) Appointment of an Adviser to the Shaikh. (e) Reformed Courts. (/) Reforms in connection with the pearl fishery. (g) Survey. (h) Public Works. (i) Education. (j) Reform of the Waqfs. I will take the above seriatim. (a) Before and during the war, Bahrain was notorious for its unhealthy climate, the stench was indescribable and plague visited it every alternate year. In the course of years the people of Manama, the chief trading town, had been becoming more and more enlightened by contact with the outside world. A N demand for greater cleanliness arose and in spite of the opposition of Shaikh Isa, the demand, backed by Major Dickson (the Political Agent), prevailed and a municipality was established in 1920. This municipality still exists and in 1927 was followed by the establishment of another in Muharraq. The two Municipal Councils—the members of which are partly nominated by the Ruler and partly elected—are presided over by Shaikh Hamad’s brothers. The Political Agent and Adviser attend the meetings but take little part in the proceedings unless asked for guidance.8 In 1920, a considerable part of the population looked upon the Marfaimt municipality as an objectionable foreign innovation, but it is now recognised as; a valuable portion of the administration. The Muharraq municipality was established in 1927 in consequence of popular demand without consulting the Political Agent. People recognise that if the municipalities were abolished filth, and plague would return. The benefit derived from the presence at municipal meetings of the Political Agent and the Adviser,, who have no vote r is to lend a certain decorum to the proceedings, which otherwise have a tendency to become pandemonium. They do not interfere unduly, and their complete withdrawal from interest in municipal affairs would be unpopular.' (6), (c) and (d) have already been treated in paragraphs 4 and 5 above. (e) Major Daly s report on the state of affairs in 1921 shows the conditions' from which Bahrain was rescued. These conditions were largely due to the lack of any Court of Law, which could deal efficiently with offenders. The minor members of the Khalifa family terrorised the people just as they wished. The- Qadhis were corrupt or impotent? A good Court of Law was a crying need, but the difficulty was to find a suitable; magistrate. At first the Political Agent (Major Daly) sat as adviser to the local magistrate, but with the arrival of Mr. Belgrave he resigned his position to the latter. At present there are the following courts functioning in Bahrain :— (1) The Joint Court on which the Ruler and the Political Agent sit to hear eases, civil and criminal, involving foreign and Bahrain subjects, in which the latter are defendants. There is also a small Joint Court presided over by the Indian Assistant and a minor AB Khalifa ; (2) The Political Agent s Court for the trial of all cases in which foreigners are concerned ; (3) Ihe Court of Shaikh Sulaiman, eldest son of Shaikh Hamad, assisted and advised by Mr. Belgrave for the trial of Bahrain subjects; (4) The Small Cause Court conducted by a minor member of the Al Khalifa. In the first case all disputes are referred to one or other of these Courts. They usually deal themselves with criminal cases though a considerable number are- referred to the Qadhis for settlement by the taking of oath. Civil cases, almost without exception, are referred to the Qadhis, the Majlis al Urfi or the Salifah Court for opinion. Judgment usually follows the opinion. The indigenous Courts are :— {a) The C ourt of the Qadhis—Sunni or Shiah as the case may be ~ (6) The Majlis al Urfi ; (c) The Salifah or Diving Court. The Qadhis are the usual Islamic Courts having jurisdiction in all personal matters, di\oices, inheritances, etc. They often advise in criminal matters, but i heir peculiar laws of evidence and the sharp differences between Shiah and Sunni make it impossible to hand criminal justice completely over to them. The Majlis al Urfi is the Court dealing with the customary law of trade. It is t ne commercial court and all disputed commercial cases are referred to it. There are twenty members. Its meetings are weekly—ten members sitting on alternate Thursdays, under an Al Khalifa president. It deals with trade disputes, on the whole expeditiously and well. Its members are all appointed by Shaikh Hamad, subject in the case of foreign members, to the Political Agent's veto. The Salifah consists of three Arab experts versed in the customary law relating fo^dfving. Before 1923 this Court consisted of one venal old man whose decisions were a disgrace to the State. Now, except for a bias against foreigners, it func tions satisfactorily.9 From this description it will be seen that except in the Court of the Political Agent—established under the Order in Council—a member of the A1 Khalifa is associated with all the proceedings of justice. Even the Political Agent’s Court refers many matters for native opinion and advice. As already stated, the Al Khalifa are uneducated and ignorant and it would be impossible for them to manage affairs without the support given them by the Political Agent or the Adviser. Both Shaikh Hamad—when he can be aroused to interest himself—and his son, Sulaiman, on all occasions, are excellent in dealing with cases demanding local knowledge ; but as they themselves confess the} would not pass sentences of death or take action against prominent men without the support of their advisers. In the course of time, Shaikh Sulaiman may get sufficient courage to stand on his own feet. A successor will be trained to take his place, when he succeeds his father in the Rulership or gets tired of his magisterial work. (/) Before 1923 the divers were wholly in the hands of their nakhudas and the merchants, who worked through the single venal member of the Salifah. Now a proper system of accounts lias been established and, thanks to the super\ ision of the Courts over the Salifah, the divers have very little cause for complaint. Their lot from being the worst has become the best in the Gulf. (g) Bahrain, in addition to town sites, has an extensive area under gardens. It was found that Shaikh Isa, as Lord of the Soil, in his happy-go-lucky way, had frequently sold or gifted the same area to two or even three different persons. The result was innumerable disputes, which could only be terminated by careful enquiry followed by an accurate survey. A survey of all towns and of certain village areas followed. At first the survey of villages was resented as people could not understand the reason for it, but now they have come to realise its benefits. Those villages which have not hitherto been surveyed, owing to paucity of staff, have begun to demand that a survey should be carried out immediately, (/?) Public Works have not been numerous and there is no regular Public Works Department; but public utility works such as the sea wall and the road alongside it are much appreciated. One of the results of these works is that the inhabitants of Kuwait and other ports are apt to point to the deficiencies of then- home towns and get into frouble with their Shaikhs, but the leaven works. If Bahrain continues on its own initiative to supply public gardens and walks, start electric schemes and carry out works for the public benefit, such as the proposed causeway from Manama to Muharraq, it is sure, by its example, to ameliorate the conditions in its lesser advanced sisters on the Arab coast, and wean them from that surly isolation in which most of them live. I mention “ on its own initiative ” because all public utility schemes—except the Manama sea wall and road, which are the work of Major Daly,—were conceived bv Bahrain subjects themselves, though they have looked to their European advisers for guidance. The British name is benefited by this progress. (i) Education is still backward, but thanks to the push of Shaikh Abdulla, the Ruler’s brother, it has made immense strides during the past two years. The drive in this case has come wholly from Bahrain subjects themselves. Except in the matter of making hitherto fruitless efforts to persuade Shaikh Hamad to educate his own sons, neither the Political Agent nor the Adviser has taken any steps unduly to push education, although their services in obtaining masters from Iraq have been put at the service of the State, when asked. Syrian and Iraqi masters have been imported in most cases without the intervention of the Political Agent or Adviser, at good salaries and there are now five indigenous Arabic boys’ schools and one girls’ school on the island, in addition to two Persian nationalist schools. In addition, eight Bahrain boys, including three close relations of the Ruling Chief, have been sent to the American University at Beirut for education. I trust that these three boys will turn out well, and with Shaikh Mubarak— the most promising of the sons of Shaikh Hamad—will provide material lor the higher appoietments in the State, and ultimately will prove competent to take over the position now held by the European Adviser and Customs Director. MC502FD10 (j) ^ a( lfs are eminently a religious matter in which it behoves foreigners, especially non-Muslims, to walk very warily. Just before his departure, Major Daly, moved by certain bad scandals, attempted to take action to reform the Waqfs, but his successor decided it would be best not to interfere and to trust to the public opinion that was being stirred by the liberal policy of the State. The policy of non-interference appears to be justifying itself. Recently the Shiahs themselves appointed a. com mittee which took over their Waqfs from the Qadhi. If the Sunnis follow suit, large sums now pocketed by the Qadhis may become available for primary education. 8. I have examined the present conduct of affairs in Bahrain and I see nothing that can be profitably altered at the present moment. Innovations which met with opposition in 1923 are now accepted as the ordinary scheme of things ; and the Bahrain merchants look forward to the develop- jnent of air communication under British auspices. The unpopularitv of the British Government, which was worked up in the Arabic and other press, has now disappeared and their good works are appreciated. In time the good works and the tyranny from which the British rescued Bahrain and especially the Shiah Baharanah will be forgotten, and only the privileged position of the British occupying the chief posts will be noticed. To a\oid the odium which would fall on Britain, in course of time, from this cause it is necessary to educate natives of Bahrain to take the place of the British officials. 9. Captain Prior, Political Agent at Bahrain, thinks that a useful under study for Mr. de Grenier offers in Abdulla bin Shaikh Ibrahim A1 Khalifa—at present a third year student at the American University in Beirut. He has industry but unfortunately no great aptitude for arithmetic. Captain Prior f^h^ks, however, that when he has completed his course at Beirut he might be sent to India for training in the Customs Department at Bombay or Karachi, befoi e being appointed to the Bahrain Customs with a view eventually to taking over charge. ^ I consider Captain Prior’s proposal very sound and recommend it for adoption. If Abdulla bin Shaikh Ibrahim’s indifferent arithmetic is a bar to the efficient per formance of his duties, one of his younger cousins—Shaikh Khalifa bin Shaikh Mahomed or Shaikh Hamad bin Shaikh Abdulla, nephews of the present Deputy Ruler, who are first-year students at Beirut, might later be selected for training. 10. There remains the question of a successor to the Adviser. Although Government do not appear to desire the immediate removal of Mr. Belgrave, this question must be considered. Shaikh Hamad, the Deputy Ruler, is an amiable nonentity. Captain Prior in alluding to his weakness and the impossibility of allowing him to stand on his owm feet has stated truly: “ so long as he can enjoy the pleasures of the harem, get shooting and hawking and enough money to support him with a little pomp and pride of place, he does not mind what happens to Bahrain.” Such a man must have an adviser on whom he can lean. His natural adviser is his eldest son, Sulaiman, age about 3o, w ho will probably succeed him. Sulaiman is not without promise ; he is intelligent and is gaining valuable experience on the Magisterial Bench, but he is uneducated and in some ways little removed from a Bedu. The only really capable member of the A1 Khalifa family is Shaikh Hamad’s brother, Abdulla, who is self-educated, but is unfortunately distrusted by the people owing to his previous evil record. Of Shaikh Hamad’s sons the one who shows most promise is Shaikh Mubarak, the the fourth son. In my letter No. 366-S. of 21st August 1929 I have already recom mended that a good tutor should be obtained for him. It is hoped that in due course he may be given a chance to acquire administrative experience so as to be a help fiist to his father and then to his brother, Sulaiman, who has no son, to follow after him, and that he may in due course be able to perform the functions now' falling to the European Adviser.11. \\ itli the spread of education it should be possible to conduct the adminis tration of Bahrain without any British interference in internal affairs in a manner which will not shame us. At present, owing to the weakness of the Deputy Ruler mid the lack of men of suitable character, this is impossible. I have laid particular stress on education in the rulers because the merchant classes in Bahrain, both foreign and native, are advancing rapidly in this respect; and the public are demanding more schools, technical education, increased medical help and trained midwives, and larger public works. A go-ahead population cannot permanently be ruled by uneducated tribesmen any more than Moroccan troops could permanently hold down the Rhine provinces. Bahrain is a large trading centre with a large foreign population. It is. not part of Aajtl and would never be happy under Wahabi rule. The real Bahraini, though an Arab, is a Shiah not a Sunni; and the history of the islands shows that for long periods it was subject to Persia. This, although not leading to any desire for I ersian rule, must modify the tribal outlook. 12. I am in favour of an indigenous Arab government standing on its own feet; but \ou cannot without grave risk of blood-shed—rapidly reverse all that has been done in the past six years. The Baharanah, for the first time since the Khalifa ousted the Persians, have had security and justice and have come to think of their rights. After tasting these sweets they will not lightly forego them. Id. J he evils of unadulterated Arab rule and the tribal system are exempli fied by the recent blood-stained record of Umm al Quwaim and Abu Dhabi or, to take bigger people from history, the Bani Rashid Rulers of Hail or the Saiyids of ( man. 1 o quote from an interesting review by Mr. B. S. Thomas appearing in the flear East and Lidia of July 18th, page 78 :— I he first act of young Said bin Sultan was to decoy his regent uncle and to assassinate him. This will to power’ was applauded by the country. It was no strange means to employ. Incidentally Said’s successor, 1 huwaini, was destined to be murdered by his own son, Salim, who thereupon succeeded to the Sultanate. During the past five years fratri cide, a time-honoured institution for the purpose, has on three several occasions been responsible for a change of Shaikhship in the powerful Omani tribes of Bani Ali and Bani Yas.” Government interfered with the free working of the Arab system first when they placed Shaikh Isa in his father s room in 18G9 and again when they replaced him by Shaikh Hamad in 1923. Under the Arab system Abdulla might have removed Shaikh Isa—he would certainly have removed Shaikh Hamad. Government is disturbed by the blood-stained record of Oman : they could not now permit similar occurrences in Bahrain. 14. Me have to make the best of Shaikh Hamad and he must have an adviser— eithei European or Arab or in the alternative take upon himself the role of a cons titutional king, confine his activities mainly to social affairs and leave business in the hands of a Council. This Council system might well be tried, but only after the death of Shaikh Isa. The old Shaikh has retired from active interest in affairs, but he still counts for something, and his naturally conservative tendency renders him opposed to all change. In addition, on the score of expense to the State, it is not desirable that Bahrain, which is already paying a pension of Rs. 5,000 yearly to Shaikh Isa, should be saddled with an idle Hamad. I anticipate no serious opposition from Shaikh Hamad himself to the idea of a Council provided he is still titular and social head. It will give him a chance of that otium cum dignitate for which he craves. The members of the council might in the first place be Shaikhs Abdulla bin Isa and Sulaiman bin Hamad with the Adviser as third member under the presi-12 dency of Shaikh Abdulla, with Shaikh Mubarak marked to succeed eventually to the Adviser's place. 15. 1 wish to emphasise that even at present there is considerably more Arab control of the Bahrain administration than would appear at first sight. In conse- quence, the present administration is popular in the islands. I agree, how r ever, that the British are too much in the high-lights, and that the signs of British influ ence appear too clearly in the Indian police force trained like an Indian infantry regiment though their uniform has been modified. I recommend that this high light be modified by substituting Sudanese, an Arab speaking force, which blends better with the population. I recommend further that, unless a European is re quired to deal with an influx of Europeans and Americans attracted by the Gulf Oil C ompany, the services of the European Commandant of Police be dispensed with at the termination of his present contract, but that the services of the Adviser and the Director of Customs be retained until suitable Arab substitutes have been trained to take their place. 16. Shaikh Hamad has already extended the term of the Adviser’s contract till March 1934. It will probably be necessary to grant him at least two further quaternary extensions. It is difficult to say when a substitute will be ready to replace Mr. de Grenier ; but the period required for training cannot be less than seven years from now. 17. As the coming of an oil company is still problematical, I have not dis cussed this matter at length. If the company should materialise it will of itself westernise the islands in possibly an unfortunate way, and I presume there would have to be a British element in the administration to counteract its effects. 18. It appears from paragraph 2 of your letter under reply that Government is perturbed at the danger that with the example of Bahrain before their eyes, the minds of the smaller Arab rulers may be turned increasingly in the direction of Bin Saud. It is tiue that the Shaikhs of the Irucial Coast are extremely jealous of anv British encroachment on their independence just as Shaikh Isa was before Lis foiced leh quishment of power. Ihey oppose any concession to the European. I do not, however, ascribe this attitude w holly to the events in Bahrain. It is due far more to the natural exclusiveness of the Arab. A certain section of Arab thought would exclude the foot of the infidel throughout the holy land of Arabia, from Aden as well as from Mecca. No attempt had been made to westernise Bahrain when the “ Hyacinth ” episode of 1911 occurred. It is irom this incident and the comparative immunity from evil consequences enjoyed by the people of Dubai that I date the increasingly independent attitude of the Trucial Shaikhs. Sir Percy Cox stated at the time that the incident furnished a convenient peg on which the Shaikh of Dubai could hang his objections to the admission of Europeans to the coast. His statement was true in 1911 and is true to this day ; but the British policy in Bahrain obviously cannot be blamed for this. ‘ ' ^ If w T e interfere in Bahrain to put down misrule, depose its Shaikh, introduce reforms and then permit the country to sink back into the slough from which we have rescued it, then indeed will we have forfeited Arab respect and cleared the w^ay for Bin Saud. In 1920 Major Dickson reported “ our position in the island is found ed on fear and not respect.’ Now it is founded on respect. The Trucial Chiefs now see that our intervention has benefited Bahrain and even its Chiefs. We cannot expect them immediately to call in British advisers on their own account, but in time their aversion from contact with the European may be overcome through the influence of a civilised Bahrain. It will not be overcome through a reversion of Bahrain to the conditions of 1920. If it suits Bin Saud he will intrigue in Oman as his fathers did before him. The attitude of the Shaikhs of the Coast will be guided by self-interest as it has e\ er been. If w e have consistently and with success espoused their cause against I ersia and &gt;sa]d they will look to us for support. It we have shown no great energy in supporting their case against third parties, they will be discouraged and more easily succumb to Najd intrigue. If Bin Saud emerges victorious from^ his present troubles, it is possible that he will seek to extend his influence on the Coast and cause us trouble as Reza Shah has in Persia ; but I do not see how the situation in Bahrain will affect the issue. All Arabs criticised our action in Bahrain when the supporters of the old regime were crying out under chastisement. The chastisement was salutary and Shaikh Isa’s supporters have accepted the present- regime, which is not unduly westernised. I have shown some ways in which the outward form may be modified while retaining the spirit, but I do not advise the jettisoning of useful European officials nor the taking of any steps other than those I have indicated. 19. I am much indebted to Captain Prior, now Political Agent at Bahrain, for a Ion g report, on which and my own experience of the islands during periods extend ing over two and a half years I have based these observations./'N 14 (9) MEMORANDUM. The paper specified below was transmitted to the Secretary, Political Department, India Office, London, for the information of His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, under cover of the Foreign Secretary’s letter No. 85-M., dated the 12th September 1929.

I shall be glad to have as soon as possible your views regarding British element in Bahrein administration referred to in Barrett’s Despatch August 28th No. 385-S. (Serial No. 9), received under your Foreign Secretary’s letter of September 12th (Serial No 10). In connection with question of our future policy in Bahrein matter is of interest—see my telegram No. 3046 of the 1st ultimo, paragraph No. 4, also your reply of No. 3171-S., October 22nd (File No. 366-N./29). (H) Telegram R., to the Secretary of State for India, London, No. 3458-S., dated the 26th November 1929. Your telegram 3651 (Serial No. 10). In Bahrein there are at present a British Political Agent, British Adviser who inter alia sits in the Court of trial of Bahrein subjects, British Director of Customs, British Commandant of Police with highly trained Indian Police force under him. Thus though the total population is certainly not more than 150,000 and may be consi derably less British element is stronger than in an ord : nary Indian district let alone an Indian State. As a result decent Government has been estab lished, finances have been put on sound footing and there has been much progress generally since 1923 when misrule forced us to induce Sheikh Isa to retire. Population is composed of so many heterogeneous elements that un animity of opinion regarding these developments is hardly to be expected. But Resident is no doubt right in feeling that decent government and especi ally the increased prosperity are appreciated by most and that we ourselves gain fair share of credit for it. At the same time he is equally right in say ing that in time conditions from which British rescued Bahrein will be for gotten and odium will fall on us for occupying a position so privileged and predominant. Outside Bahrein Barrett feels that its administration is now the admiration of the Gulf. This seems open to question for there have been signs of Arab uneasiness not merely on the Trucial coast but in Kuwait over the object lesson afforded by Bahrein of the rapid attenuation of the Arab spirit and forms of government once our powerful influence is admitted. Sheikh Hamad’s encouragement of Bin Saud’s intercessions on behalf of Bahrein tribesmen whom he himself had been forced to expel under pressure from us and whom Arab public opinion demanded that he should receive back in the customary way after the customary formalities had been fulfilled {vide papers forwarded under Foreign Secretary’s letter of 16th June 1927 47.-M.) is an arresting example of Barrett’s maxim that it is better that the Sheikh should govern and make mistakes than that we should govern and make none.15 There can of course be no question of rapidly reversing all that has been done m the past six years. It has indeed been good in itself. Still less can there be any question of our relaxing our essential hold on Bahrein. Only question is whether time has now come to check the momentum towards complete Westernisation and to lay down general lines of policy which while making for continuance of decent government and sober progress will save us rom the odium and at the same time from the dangers inside and outside Bahrein which seem likely to flow from too obvious Westernisation and absorption of these tiny islands. After all it is not only vis-a-vis the Arabs that it is politic for as to work through a genuinely Arab administration Jt actually increases our power vis-a-vis foreign intruders : thus an obviously autonomous Arab State can close its doors in a way in which an obviously British run State cannot. ^ Like Barrett we feel that nothing can be effected immediately even as regards the police until it is known whether the threatened invasion of Americans is going to materialise. If it does not materialise we feel that the Resident should be asked to work out definite schemes for his proposed substitution of Sudanese for Indian police and to tackle problem of who^s to replace the British Commandant. Meanwhile he and the Political A^ent should proceed steadily to advise the Sheikh to persist in the training of aSiftrat^n 18 ^h ? T* ^ adua ^ fillin g various posts i^the administration.

On all other points he is in general agree ment with the views expressed by Colonel Barrett and the Government of India, and subject to any observations which Mr. Henderson and Lord Passfield may wish to offer, he proposes to approve the line of action suggested by the Viceroy (Serial No. 11). 3.

I am directed by Lord Passfield to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. P. 7575/29 of the 3rd January [Serial No. (13)], transmitting a copy of corres pondence on the question of the strength of the British element and the degree of British interference in the internal administration of Bahrein, and to request that you will inform Mr. Secretary Benn that he concurs in the course of action proposed in the 2nd paragraph of your letter. 2. Copies of this letter are being sent to the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry. (15) Letter from the Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel H. V. Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 43-S., dated the 13 th February 1930. I have the honour to invite a reference to Mr. Acheson’s letter No. F. 164-N./29, dated 18th June 1929 [Serial No. (5)], regarding the retention of the services of Mr. C. deGrenier, Director of Customs, Bahrein. It w^as therein stated that the Government of India proposed to await the Resident’s views on the general question of the “ westernisation ” of Bahrein before deciding on the particular question of the retention of Mr. deGrenier’s services. These views have since been com municated to the Government of India by my predecessor, and they in turn have communicated their views to H. M.’s Secretary of State [Serial No. (9)] (vide telegram No. 3458-S., dated 26th November 1929) [Serial No. (11)]. Mr. de Grenier proposes to proceed on leave in April next, and is naturally anxious to know whether he is to return or not. I would therefore request that the Government of India may be pleased to pass orders in the matter. 2. In this connection I would venture to put before the Government of India the impressions that I gained during my recent visits to Bahrein. The present Ruler is Shaikh Hamad : he is entirely devoid of energy and has no desire to govern : he himself is glad to leave everything to the Adviser, and has to be pressed to give a decision on any matter. He retires on every possible occasion to his country seat 10 miles from the town in order to avoid petitioners and State worries, and it is at least doubtful whether, had the succession been allowed to take its course without any intervention on our part, he would not have been ousted by his more forceful brother Abdullah. Had the latter succeeded things would probably have been different but as it is we have to make the best of things as they are. The only question that really interests Shaikh Hamad is the allowances of himself and his family, and the A1 Khalifa family have not abandoned th^ former idea that the taxes paid by the inhabitants are the just spoils of the Ruling Family. 3. The revenues of Bahrein amount to about 10 lakhs, and of this 50 percent, is paid to the Shaikh and his relatives : he has made constant efforts to get this sum of 5 lakhs increased but both Colonel Barrett and I have informed him that we consider it ample, and have refused to agree to any increase. On the other hand Bahrein has practically only one source of income, the customs, which collect 97% of the total revenue. If the measure of control which is at present exercised by Europeans in Bahrein was sensibly relaxed I think there is very little doubt but that the revenues would be appreciably diminished, and allowances of the Ruling Family appreciably increased, and the result would be, if not immediate insolvency, at any rate a complete cessation of those educational, medical and sanitary developments that we have brought about, and which the people of Bahrein now expect, and clamour for. 4. I am in entire sympathy with the idea that we should work as far as possible through an Arab administration : no one who has received his earliest training, as I did, in the Baluchistan school could be otherwise, but we must take account of the actual circumstances. We have a ruler who, practically speaking, refuses to rule, and there are no state subjects at present sufficiently educated to fill the more important posts. MC75FD18 5. It may be asked why we should not allow Bahrein to be run as, for instance Kuwait is, as an Arab city on Arab lines. The answer is that the population of the two cities is wholly dissimilar. The population of Kuwait is largely Bedouin : their outlook is towards and of the desert. The people who come and shop there are the desert Arabs of the interior. Kuwait commanded till recently the pick of the Bedouin tribes, the Ajman and Mutair, and all their wealth and trade came from traffic with the interior and from their flocks and herds. Finally Kuwait has a homogeneous population. The population of Bahrein is hetrogeneous and divided by racial and religious differences—Nejdis, Wahabis, Persians, Sunnis, Shiahs and large colonies of Mohammedan and Hindu Indians. Bahrain is a purely commercial centre, its outlook is towards Bombay and the stock markets of the world on which it depends to sell its pearls. The people who come and shop there are largely the wealthy pearl merchants of Paris and Bombay. It has no tribes worth mentioning, and an enervat ng and relaxing climate which shows itself in the Arabs who have settled there. Its wealth comes from its pearls almost entirely : it may perhaps be increased shortly by the discovery of oil. 7. Now with a population such as this, many of whose members are extremely wealthy, and which is brought in closer contact with the outside world than the population of any other place in the Gulf, it is not unnatural to find a strong desire for decent administration and for the amenities which they obtain elsewhere. As was stated in your telegram referred to above [Serial No. (11)], what we have done is good in itself. We have not foisted upon an unwilling people measures which they did not want or a horde of low paid officials, neither have we introduced vexatious rules or regulations. We have improved the lot of the diver and largely rescued him from virtual slavery : we have established simple courts where cases are ex peditiously settled, not on legal technicalities but on diving or commercial practice understood by all or according to the religious precepts of the parties concerned : we have enabled the State out of its own resources to make one or two good roads, to instal electric lights, and to make at any rate some small beginning with education. Finally, and to this I attach much importance, there are now in Bahrain two municipalities which do good work. Their resolutions are at times ludicrous, as for instance when they wished to decree that ladies must wear certain types of garments, but on the whole their work is satisfactory and at any rate the members are gaining some experience of local self-government, which it is to be hoped will in course of time enable them to be of service in a wider sphere. 8. Bahrain has 3 European officials, an Adviser, or Diwan as he would be called in India, a Superintendent of Police and a Director of Customs, and I must say that I think the State is extremely fortunate in the Europeans whose services it has secured. Mr. Belgrave is keen and tactful; has had previous experience of Arabs in the Colonial Service and speaks the language well and is a charming and cultured man to meet in himself : he struck me as being the best stamp of British official and just the man that is required. Mr. Parke 1 did not meet, as he is at home on leave, but the Political Agent spoke highly of him. Mr. deGrenier, though of a different type to Mr. Belgrave, is full of enthusiasm about the somewhat humdrum functions he is called upon to perform, and Colonel Barrett thought highly of him, as reported to the Government of India in his despatch No. 184-S., dated 1st June 1929 [Serial No. (4)]. 9. There is really no analogy between Bahrain and an Indian State. The latter can obtain as many fully trained Indian officials as they require, yet despite this an increasing number of them nowadays employ Europeans in different capa^ cities : Bahrain cannot obtain Bahrainis or Arabs qualified to hold the higher posts. Syrians and Egyptians are just as much foreigners as an Englishman is. 10. I therefore see no likelihood of the State being able to dispense with Mr' Bclgrave’s services within any period that need at present be taken into account. Again as pointed out by the Government of India, the necessity for a European Superintendent of Police largely depends on whether the threatened influx of European oil-borers materialises or not. If it does then the presence of a European to deal with the hetrogeneous elements that will flock to the oil fields wil certainly be necessary. It is not possible to come.to a decision at present. Mr. Parke is at present on leave and I understand will return for a year or two, but it is improb-. &gt;19 able that be will be willing to stay on after this. The question whether he should be replaced by another European or not will be considered then. 11. Mr. Belgrave spoke to me about the replacement of the Indian police by Soudanese, and I think it would be a good thing. There is a large negro element in Bahrain, and they would merge in the population more than Indians do. Mr. Belgrave has had previous experience of them in Egypt and says that they make efficient police. He suggested to me that when he proceeded on leave in 1931 he should recruit them on his way out and bring them back with him. I think this arrangement would be satisfactory, and might be given effect to irrespec tive of the arrival or non-arrival of the oil company, and I trust the Government of India will be pleased to approve of it. 12. Finally, as pointed out by Colonel Barrett, Mr. deGrenier s functions are purely administrative, and not political: he has no hand in any matter that affects the daily lives of the people, and owing to the fact that the Bahrain revenue consists almost exclusively of the customs receipts, any falling off under this head is a much more serious matter than would be a decrease under one head in a more normal budget. His dealings are almost exclusively with the commercial classes, shipping companies, etc., and not with the mass of the people. As Colonel Barrett asked, why replace a foreigner who has proved his efficiency by a less efficient foreigner, which is what the replacement of Mr. deGrenier by an Egyptian, Syrian or Iraki would mean. I may mention that Mr. de Grenier is on an indefinite contract terminab e by 3 months’ notice on either side, so there will be no difficulty in dispensing with his services shou'd this at any time be considered desirable. 13. To sum up, I do not think it will be possible to dispense with the services of Mr. Belgrave within any time that need be taken into consideration at present. As regards the police, Mr. Parke will probably resign in a year or two, and the question of his successor can be taken up then : it depends to a great extent on whether oil is found in Bahrain or not. Meanwhile however I recommend that steps should be taken to replace the Indian police by Soudanese next year, and request the approval of the Government of India to this. As regards the Customs, J would suggest that I be authorised to inform the Shaikh that there is no objection to the retention of Mr. de Grenier. 14. Since drafting the above I have been informed by H. M.’s Minister at Tehran that the Government of India have agreed m principle to the transfer of the Residencv to the Arab side subject to certain conditions wh ch are at present under consideration in England. It seems not improbable that the Residency will be transferred to Bahrain : if so then it will, I think, be of little ava l to try and ar rest the tendency towards ‘westernisation’. If the Political Resident is to be permanently located at Bahrain, then the authority of the Shaikh must automati- callv tend to decrease, and it will naturally be regarded as a’most tantamount to the declaration of a definite protectorate over these islands, even though no formal announcement to that effect is made.

No decision has as yet been taken on this proposal, which is at present of a purely tentative character, and the substitution would not in any case take effect until 1931, when the contract of the present Indian police expires. I shall be glad, however, to learn whether the Sudan Government would be prepared to agree to the proposal and, if necessary, to facilitate recruitment. 3. The present force consists of about one hundred men and approximately the same number of Sudanese would 'presumably be required, were the suggested change effected. The Superintendent of Police is at the present time an English man. The question whether it is desirable to retain a British official in this post is at present under consideration, but no decision has been taken on the point.

It will facilitate the enquiry now being made of the Sudan Government if they can be furnished with information showing the strength of the force of Sudanese which it is proposed to recruit for the Bahrein Police, the rates of pay of all ranks to be recruited and the nature and period of the contracts which it is proposed to offer. Please submit at least a rough outline of your proposals at your early con venience. In so doing it might be worth while to state whether the service would be pensionable or not; or do you think that short term contracts would be pre ferable ? 3. The Government of India are of opinion that the question of the retention of a British officer as Commandant of the Bahrein Police may be left for considera tion later on when, amongst other factors influencing the situation, it will be known whether Indians are to be replaced by Sudanese, or not. Please forward your re? commendation on this question of Mr. Parke’s successor not less than three months before the date on which his contract is due to expire.

After cos/, letm^ the scrutiny the Inspector should place the file before the Superintendent of Police for his oraers &amp;s to ehetner the case should be put into court or aithhela for further police action. If tne Superintendent of Police decides that the case shoum be placed in court tre investi^eting officer should t lace Uie charge sheet before the Mag strate having jurisdiction togatiier vith aiiy case property ana he should also iroauce the accused and prosecution witnea ea.

It reflects consider able credit on those concerned met me records, which when removed from the Police were apparently in an claost hopeless state of confusion hsve now been sorted out and ere satisfactorily maintained. I hive the following remarks:- i. The Ccamfen iant of Police is the Licensing end Registering Authority of tne Bahi^ain Government, but aii tne records ore a ntained tne State Engineer. If the ci su estea ii. this report are effected the possibility of trenaferin^ this work back to the Police should be conaid rtd.The Inspector could be made respous Me for Uie maintenance of these records but he would re ture eAtra staff. 1. The ft*, for ti.e driving test (Ra.iv-) is paid after y rssing the meiical examination end tlie ap : licant is given a receipt. This receipt is produced at this test and the result marked on it in pencil with the letter p or F usually without signature or uate. Tnis marked receipt is Uas authority on which the license is ued. This is unsatisfactory and the apptieation form should conta ^n a apace fur the result of the medical ex&amp;mihetion ^nci driving teat, etch beia ( filledin, signed nnd dated by the officer concerned, .

No recoru is Kept either bj tne oiice or tiit St^te Engineer end it seeas tn&amp;t a men hts only to lose his -Licence and ap* ly f^r a new one for tne atter to be forgotten* I consleer that licenses for enaorsement should be sent by courts to tne Suete Engineer who will aa&lt;e an entry in such licenses and in tiie Begister cf driving licenses ana also inform tne Police. Licenses suspended should be retained in the Stfete Pngineiir 1 * office. Aid enti ies of this nature should be in red ink. It is noticed that a number of persons receive free driving licenses end registration who in my opinion r.re not entitled to them, persons not employeu as Governuient ar^vers should pay for Uieir driving licences ana aXi persons not i- &gt;ueu witii State C^rs for registration TtAli Idl CIVIL X)LIC. .
