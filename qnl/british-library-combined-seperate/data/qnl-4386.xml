They are followed by file notes (folios 275-298), which include a chronological list of documents in the file that are dated 1935 onwards (folios 53-366), together with their unique document reference number, to help identify them. The list also records the earlier, secondary folio numbers of the documents, as well as the simple reference number from 1 to 29 that has been written on the later documents (folios 243-365) in red or black ink and encircled. The pencilled folio numbers and the red and black document numbers help to locate specific documents in the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: numbered 1-89, 89A, 89B, 90-167, 168A, 168B, 169A, 169B, 170-299.
