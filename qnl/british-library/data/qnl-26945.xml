J I HAVE the honour to inform your Lordship that the following communique was issued by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 30th December, 1938 “ The publication, in the Petit Parisien and Excelsior of the 2nd December, of an account of a cat show, including a pun perpetrated by a comic paper, the Os a Moelle, has caused a violent press campaign at Tehran against France. The French Minister at Tehran has been instructed to make to the Iranian authorities the necessary explanations to dispel the misunderstanding which the publication of these articles seems to have created in Court circles. None the less, the Iranian (xovernment decided on the 28th December to break off diplomatic relations with the French Government.” 2. The Temps (Right) adds that the official notification of the rupture of diplomatic relations was conveyed to M. Bonnet in a note addressed to him on the 30th December, on behalf of the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, by the Iranian Minister at Paris. It recalls that an incident of the same nature led to the refusal of Iran to participate in the Paris Exhibition of 1937. 3. The Petit Parisien (Centre) of the 31st December states that the article in question contained no reference whatever to the Shah, but was merely headed : “Quand Sa Majeste le Chat Regoit.” A copy of a cutting from the Petit Parisien reproducing the heading in question is attached^ 1 2 3 4 ) 4.

In Zahidan, a topic much discussed amongst Iranians is the friendship between Iran and Germany. It is generally stated that the attitude of Germany towards Iran is most satisfactory. Germany, it is said, grants Iranian goods preferential rates of customs duty, and wishes to help Iran in every way. It appears that officials encourage these statements as they openly claim Germany as the best friend of Iran.In iWrf^oiimmnication on tliis a/nbiect, please quote ' No. f and address —not to any person by nfiine, but/jio— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.\Y r . 1. p. z. f , '579 \ IP v.; ^TQ - !■: .

IN my despatch No. 473 of the 18th December last, I had the honour to report briefly on the visit to Tehran of Herr Baldur von Schirach, leader of the Hitler Youth. I have since received copies of the despatches which His Majesty’s Ambassador at Moscow addressed to the Foreign Office ( Nos. 610 of the 18th December, 1937, and No. 14 of the 10th January), reporting on comments in the Soviet press on this visit. 2 . I think that the remarks made in the Soviet papers quoted are largely speculative, and that the deductions which they drew have, for the most part, no foundation. It is, perhaps, of interest to note that the article published by the Journal de Moscou suggesting that the visit was evidence of Iranian subjection to Fascist influence, resulted in the Journal de Teheran printing an article ridiculing such a charge. As regards the story in the Moscow Daily News to the effect that the Iranian Minister of Education hiad been reprimanded by the Shah for his share in entertaining Herr Baldur von Schirach, I should mention that I see no reason to suppose that such a rebuke was, in fact, delivered. It is, in fact, almost inconceivable that the programme arranged should not have received the previous approval of His Imperial Majesty. A further indication is that the Minister of Education himself talked to me about Herr von Schirach’s visit, after we had seen a parade of boy scouts on the occasion of the coup d Etat celebrations. M. Hikmat told me that Herr von Schirach had expressed admiration of the progress made by the scout movement in Iran, but had suggested that it was a pity to have followed the “ Baden-Powell model,' and that the movement should have been formed on purely national lines. M. Hikmat replied that it was precisely the international character of the Baden-Powell type of scout movement which made it so suitable for adoption in Iran, and that to reject a good innovation because it was not “ national ” would be like refusing to accept the discoveries of Pasteur because they were not “national ' in countries other than France. Herr von Schirach, according to M. Hikmat, could find no reply to this somewhat surprising analogy, and developed no further his argument in favour of “ national ” as against “ Baden-Powell ” scouting. 3. Shortly after the publication of the article in the Journal de Teheran, the Soviet Charge d’x\ffaires remarked in conversation that there was a tendency in the Tehran press to publish articles slighting the democratic Powers (among which he included the Soviet Union), while references to the totalitarian Powers were more complimentary. There is some truth in this, but I believe it to be mainly due to the fact that the controlled press of countries such as Germany and Italy avoid stirring up Iranian susceptibilities, and the Governments of these countries thus avoid being drawn into the futile “ press incidents ' which have in recent years disturbed, to a greater or less degree, the relations between Iran and France, the United States and the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union is in rather a different situation, and the press controversy reported in Lord Chilston's despatches appears to have been deliberately invoked by Moscow. 4 . As regards the suggestion of the Journal de Moscou that Iran is being, or may be, drawn into the “ orbit of German and Italian colonial aspirations,’’ I take this to be the newspaper’s way of saying that Italian and German influence is increasing in Iran. I should not say that Italian influence is increasing, but the commercial interests of Germany have, as I have frequently reported, greatly developed owing to the operation of the clearing agreement. Some Iranians seem [264 o—l]i 2 to think that they can safely run more and more heavily into German debt. To others, among whom is the Minister of Commerce, the increasing debt to Germany causes much anxiety. It seems to me that, so long as the present rapid industrial development of Iran continues, and so long as Germany is willing to supply the means for that development on credit, the position of Germany will be further strengthened. 5. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Moscow. I have, &amp;c. H. J. SEYMOUR.SO. 462 (363/12/37) Ibth Teoeraber, 1937 Sir 7th Auf^ast, I have the honour to infom you that the Shah and the Iranian Government have onoe afrain been incensed by the publication in the French press of articles regarded as insulting to Iran. trouble began with an article in the ^Paris - Soir* about the Journey of the Queen to K irope, in which the writer said that the comfort in which the Queen travelled recalled the luxury of the Persian court. 'T’his provoked an article in the 'Ettela*at', a translation of which appeared in the 'Journal de Teheran' headed 'Encore la presse fran^ise', containing an attack on France virulent out of all proportion. The next day another long article appeared in the 'Journal de Teheran' ridiculing the 'renoh for holding a Cat show, of which an account had been given in the Paris 'Journal'. The reader familiar with Iranian susceptibilities was not surpiiaed to find in the lust paragraph of this long article that the offence of the writer in the 'Journal' was to make the ole pun on the words 'Shah' and 'ohat'. 3* The i renoh Charge d* Affaires lias informed me Hi at he went to see the Minister of Foreign Affairs after 2. It appears that on the present occasion the The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., 1T.P / the tHe found the the publication of those two articles. Miniater in a state of some excitement, j'. Ramil tolfi him that the article in the ’•Puris-Soir'' about the Queen's journey was humiliating to modern Iran. Pis Excellency added that the Iranian Government had been on the point of selecting a new Minister for Paris, but that the articles in the French press had changed the situation. 4. M. de la Blanohetai told me that he was unoertain whether the Iranian Government would really refuse to appoint a new Minister on such grounds as these. Re concluded by saying that his visit had at least had the effect of stopping the publication of a further series of attacks on France which he knew to be ready. 5. T am sending a copy of this despatch to Pis i^ajesty^ Ambassador at Paris. I have the honour to be, 'ith the highest res sect. Sir, Tour mos t obedient, humble Servant (*&gt;c.) ' . eytaourCopy. ^3 5092/5092/34) No. 304„ 5966 BRITISH L30ATI0N, Tehran. 7th August 1937 Sir, Despatches from this Legation have from time to time reported on the frigidity of the relations which have for some time existed between Iran and the United States and Prance. In each case the Shah had taken offence at Press articles; The Iranian Legation in Washington has been closed for over a year, while the Legation in Paris has been left without a Minister. 2. Persian resentment towards the United States (though it was not allowed to affect matters of business, such as the Amiranian Oil Concession) went so far that no American newspapers or publications were allowed to be delivered in Iran. An exception was, however, made in favour of certain technical publications, the non-delivery of which was found to cause serious inconvenience. When Mr. Engert arrived here as United States Charge d’Affaires, he found that even such innocuous periodicals as the volumes of the Laws of the United States, journals of International Law and similar publications addressed to his Legation had been suppressed. No notification had, Mr. Engert tells me, been made by the Persian Post Office to the American Post Office or to the Berne Bureau; everything had simply been retained by the Persian authorities and, he believes, mostly destroyed. As a result of strong representations made by Mr. Bngert as to the illegality and futility of the Persian action, American publications are again being delivered and the relations between/ The Right Honourable, Anthony Eden M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., THE FOREIGN OFFICE.'@r' ^ s between the two countries are to this extent improved. 3. In the case of Prance too it seems to have been decided that matters nave gone far enough. Senator Konorat is at present in Iran on what is, I believe, a mission for the promotion of cultural relations. He was first entertained at a G-overnment banquet at which the sneeches by the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Senator were commendably short, merely recording the fact that no shade has ever clouded or ever can cloud the cordial relations which have always existed between the two countries. Subsequently Monsieur Honorat was received by the Shah, delivering to His Imoerial Majesty a letter from the President of the French Republic and presenting the insignia of the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour. This was followed by an audience with the Valiahd. Finally, after a week-end at Isfahan, Monsieur Honorat was made Honorary Doctor of the University of Tehran, and entertained to dinner by the Minister of Public Instruction, to whom he presented in return the Medal of the University of Paris. 4. I should like to think that these develooments indicate a diminished sensitiveness to Press criticism, but it would in my opinion be over-optimistic to take such a view. Any foreign Press comment which appears to reflect on the Shah oersonally will, I fear, continue to oroduce the familiar reactions. 5.

HOARS.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT A GOOD deal of mystery surrounds the melodramatic reappearance in Tehran, two months after his official departure, of Mr. C. C. Hart, the former American Minister here. 2. The present American Charge d’Affaires, who was Mr. Hart’s secretary, professes to be as mystified as anybody by the arrival of his former chief, without evening dress, but with a new motor car, to lodge with the archivist of the Legation. It seems certain that Mr. Hart is engaged on his former profession of journalism, and has, in the course of a rapid passage through England, Germany and the Soviet Union, during which he does not seem to have interviewed any prominent personalities, written up those countries for a group of newspapers which he is representing. His remarks about Hitler are intended to enlighten the American public as to the Fiihrer’s real origin, a case of miscegenation between a rattlesnake and a porcupine. Russia, on the other hand, is, in Mr. Hart’s opinion, a fine country, where everybody has enough to eat, though not too much. As for England, I gather that Mr. Hart’s articles are likely to consist mainly of sobstuff about Westminster Abbey in the style of the late Horatio Bottomley; while the Irish Free State is dismissed by Mr. Hart in the statement: “I’m not a believer in any religion, but, my God, those fanatical Papists just get my goat! ’’ Mr. Hart denies any intention to write about Persia, in order not to embarrass his successor, but Mr. Wadsworth feels none too sure that this virtuous resolution will be maintained, and quite expects that/ the next Imperial outburst will be directed against the United States of America. 1 3. Journalism is not, however, according to Mr. Wadsworth, the main object of Mr. Hart’s return to haunts which he loudly hated. Oil is supposed to be his main interest, and the impending arrival of Mr. Clapp, the American oil geologist, who has frequently been employed by the Persian Government, notably last year at the time of the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company concession, is supposed to portend collaboration. Mr. Clapp has apparently for many years been attracted by a scheme to exploit the small Semnan oil-field in order to supply Tehran with oil (see Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 259 of the 14th June, 1930). Mr. Wadsworth believes that Mr. Hart and Mr. Clapp are backed by a big concern, and will attempt to get this concession. They are also said to be interested in the exploitation of oil in Northern Afghanistan, r The Afghan Ambassador confirms this, so possibly Mr. Hart’s visit to Herat, // reported in Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 271 of the 17th June, 1930, may not have]! been as entirely innocent as he claimed. 4. The chief of police, when asked jokingly by a member of my staff what Mr. Hart was doing here, poured out a long and most improbable tale about a carpet designed by Mr. Hart, which a carpet dealer had duplicated and sold to someone else. General Ayrom admitted, however, that Mr. Hart must be engaged in other activities as well. Of course, it is possible that, among other things, Mr. Hart is doing some business in carpet exportation. He had made a large and expensive collection when Minister here, and obviously intended to sell some of it on his return to the United States. 5.

Sir, ive the honour to report that Mirsa Ghaffar Khan Jelal, the head of the Kngliah Seetion in the Ministry of Foreign Affaire, has been appointed Persian Minister at Washington. 2. Jelal vae for many years attached to the Persian Legation in London, at the time vhen hia uncle, the late Prince Ala-es-Suitaneh, was Minister. He subsequently served in Sweden and Home and also became Minister at Cairo. While at Rome his agr^ment for Washington was asked for and given: however he did not proceed, but went to Cairo instead, 3. Jelal has at all times shown himself most friendly and helpful while occupying his present post at the Ministry and I shall keenly regret his departure, which can hardly fail to make the conduct of current business even more difficult than at present. It is possible that his friendliness might at times have been more effective had his intelligence allowed him to grasp more quickly or more clearly where the point of the difficulty lay, but with all his limitations it was A pleasant to know that there was one signle-mlnded man in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 4. Madame Jelal is a good-looking and pleasant /Englishwoman, 3Knglisnwoman, not overburdened with brains, who is popularly supposed to have been once connected with the musical comedy stage. 6 . Both Jelal and his wife have for years been pining for a post abroad and hie present appointment has been made possible by the removal from the scene of Teymourtache. The latter was not actively hostile, but he can have had little sympathy for a man of Jelal's temperament; moreover scandal mongers alleged that he had made the enjoyment of Madame Jelal's friendship a condition of her husband's employment abroad. 6 . The downfall of Teymourtache has also led to the appointment of Mlrza Haasan All Khan Qhaffari to Brussels, but for the opposite reason that it is desired Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is generally liked as a fairly civilized official and there is reason to believe that in so far as the work of Ohaffari; I hope that he will stay here. His appointment is not yet formally confirmed. 7. The Jelals are trying to let their house a very long absence. 8 .
