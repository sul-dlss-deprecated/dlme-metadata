Follow ing from Mark Sykes i—Begins. Much obliged for Storrs being placed at my disposal. Special importance is attached by me to good Liason with Mesopotamian political service and Anglo-French political mission beyond Egyptian frontier. Storrs should, therefore, proceed at once to Baghdad to confer with Cox and explain to him Anglo-French agreement and inform him fully regarding Hedjaz and Cairo situation. Following matters of special importance should be explained:— (1) That mission beyond Egyptian frontier is a joint one and that I and my French colleagues intend to work in cordial co-operation on the strict lines of the agreement. (2) That it is therefore important that I should be kept posted as to Cox’s relations with Arabs or other elements in area A. I also wish Storrs to arrange with Cox a basis of common policy between joint mission and Mesopotamia in regard to relations with Shaniye who will probably be in touch with both frontier force and Force “ D Storrs should reach Baghdad about the same time that the joint mission gets to work in Syria and should be able to elucidate any point which may arise in initial correspondence between Cox and joint mission, which requires local knowledge of Syrian point of view. Storrs should also make a special study of Baghdad and facilitate co-operation between Mesopotamia and the joint mission. His stay in Baghdad should be limited to the shortest possible period and to not more than 10 days at the most. He should take with him copies hof any documents likely to be of use. While be is on this mission I suggest that he should (if you so desire) perform any additional liason work which may commend itself to you as regards Egypt and Hedjaz. On his return Storrs would replace Assistant Political Officer lent me temporarily by Mesopotamia. 13 Telegram, No. 2867, dated the 10th (received 11th) April 1917.

About 80 Armenian girls found among Muhammadan families here have been rescued or collected by us and we expect to find possibly 200 in all, sq that including these there will probably be from 100 to 500 Armenian refugees in all in Baghdad. I was discussing the question of re-promulgation of India Office Notifica* tion to Arab Chiefs, &amp;c., with Armenian Archbishop and leading Armenian residents yesterday, and we came to the conclusion that for us to draw too much attention to our activity in favour of the few hundred Armenians here, might incite the Turks to perpetrate further atrocities on the many thousands of Armenians still at their mercy. I was on the point of wiring to you to above effect. We have the matter in hand and in mind locally and in my opinion it seems best in interests of Armenians generally that we should not draw too much public attention to our efforts. Your final wishes should please be telegraphed. 16 Telegram R., No. 455-S., dated the 13th April 1917. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla,.

From—The British High Commissioner, Egypt, Cairo, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. (Addressed London Foreign Office.) A letter from Persian Consulate at Jeddah has been received by Consul- General, Persia, here asking that local British authorities at Jeddah may be instructed to safeguard legitimate interests of Persian subjects and to secure good treatment by Sheriffian authorities. Consulate at Jeddah which is presumably under Persian Embassy at Constantinople is commercial one I understand. No specific ill-treatment of Persians at Jeddah is alleged. Subject to your concurrence I propose to instruct Colonel Wilson he has discretion to exercise his good offices with local Sheriffian authorities as between them and Persian subjects when the latter request him to do so. It seems inadvisable to raise the question of Persian Government entering into direct diplomatic relations with King of Hedjaz at present. 18 # Telegram P., No. X.-1741, dated the 13fch (received 16th) April 1917. From—The General Officer Commanding, Force “ D ”, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla (repeated Secretary of State). Friendly letters were sent by my Chief Political Officer on arrival here to chief Mujtahids of Kerbela and Nejef individually. Since then two Political Officers have been visiting both towns, amongst others on that side with escort of Sheikhs. Incidentally they called on chief Mujtahids to enquire after their welfare on my behalf. Their tour is still unfinished. Cox has received meantime cordial letters from several Mujtahids and among them Saiyid Abdul Hussein Tabatahai, one of the three premier Mujtahids of Kerbela, has enclosed a telegram to address of His Majesty the King for onwards despatch if there is no objection. Translation runs as follows:— Begins. I and all the spiritual leaders of Islam here offer Your Majesty our heartfelt congratulations on conquest of Baghdad “ dar es salaam Ends. In any case there is in my opinion no objection to a suitable acknowledg ment being sent and it will perhaps be considered a convenient opening for a gracious message from His Majesty to the Ulema for publicity purposes. 19 No. C.-221, dated Aden Residency, the 28th March 1917 (Secret). From— Major-General J. M. Stewart, C.B., Political Resident, Aden, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, India Office, London. I have the honour to forward herewith the latest correspondence held between this office and the Imam Yahya, and the Idrisi, and also a precis of the dealings of the Aden Besidency and the tribesmen of the Hashid and Bakil, drawn np at my request by the First Assistant Resident, Lieutenant-Colonel H. F. Jacob. 2. A copy of this letter and accompaniments are being sent to the Gov ernment of India, Foreign Department. No. C.-222. Copy with accompaniments forwarded, with compliments, to the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, Simla. Note .—Copies have been sent to His Britannic Majesty’s High Com missioner, Cairo.Precis of the dealings with the tribesmen of Hashid wa Bakil and other matters germane. An original letter has been brought to Aden and written by the Governor- General of the Yemen to Sheikh Hizam Pasha bin Abdallah al Sar. It is dated 6th November 1916 in reply to one from Hizam of date 14th March 1916. The subject-matter goes back to what occurred one year ago, but discloses jealousy and ill-feeling in the ranks of the Bakil tribesmen. This Sheikh Hizam al Sar was created Pasha by the Turks. He is considered even now the principal Sheikh of Amran—one of the Bakil septs. He is aggrieved because his rival Nakib Abdallah bin Mansur al Amaisa (Bakil) has been made Governor of the province of Amran over his head. He enquires of the Governor-General whose appointment this is—whether Turks’ or Imam’s, and the Governor-General replies that these two are indisseverably united and form a solid phalanx in defence of Islam against all enemies. This move on the part of the Governor-General was evidently made to sow dissension in the Bakil ranks. Al Sar was perhaps courting the Idrisi. An allusion is made by Al Sar to the Hashid tribe but what exactly was alluded to is not stated. The Governor-General tells the addressee that the Hashid are honourable men and submissive in all things to Turks and to Imam—“a very proper allegiance due from a Zeidi clan The Governor- General warns Al Sar not to criticise the Hashid, for this amounts to a criti cism of the Sublime Government and he assures him that the Hashid will vote plump for the Turkish Government. Pinally, Governor-General defends collection by the Imam of tithes to which Al Sar had apparently taken exception on the ground that it was “ graft ” made to others’ pockets. The above correspondence fell into the hands of Saiyid Yahya bin Abdul Bahman at Jizan. This is the Saiyid who came from Jeddah with the Sheriffian envoy “ Sheikh al Sada”. This proves that Al Sar or his emissary must have come down there to try his luck with the Idrisi. These tribesmen of Hashid wa Bakil are pure mercenaries who swarm to the standard of the biggest briber. They are fickle to a degree. It is a common practice for sept to leave sept and join the man with the largest purse. It is hardly possible for one man to enlist the Hashid ^a Bakil in their entirety. These tribesmen were originally in the pay of the Imam who being stingy got Izzat Pasha, when Turkey was fighting Italy, to pay not only hia (Imam’s) stipend but that of these refractory tribesmen of his. Some of the Hashid wa Bakil disapproved of Imam’s wooing the Turks, and left to start an intrigue with the anti-Turk Idrisi. Nasir Mabkhut al Ahmar was one of the leading Hashid who wrote to the Idrisi, and quite recently Saiyid Yahya, who was in Jizan, reported that Haj Masud al Bariki (Hashid); and of the Bakil: Saleh Dughaish, principal Sheikh of B. Harith, and Sheikh Ibrahim bin Ali of al Boda were in Jizan and plotting to win Idrisi’s support; To complicate matters still further, this Saiyid Yahya carried certain proposals from the King of the Hedjaz to Hashid wa Bakil and was able to secure letters from various Sheikhs of Hashid wa Bakil in which they offer their services to Sheriff Husein. The avowed object is to oust the Turks but the conditions formulated include money, arms and ammunition and various other important details of requirements now, and after the war. The principal signatories are Ali Husein ai Bariki, Ahmed bin Yahva bin Par a : Ali bin Mukbil Abu Said, Haj Mas ud bin Aid al Bariki all of Hashid; and various Bakil Sheikhs. The Idrisi sends the Besident an original letter to him from the Bakil Sheikh Yahya bin Yahya al Shaif (copy attached letter A). This Sheikh is of importance and lives at Al Zahir. His daughter was given in marriage to the Hashid Sheikh Ahmed Yahya Para. The lei ter proves the writer to^be a prime braggart. The Besident’s reply to Idrisi is attached (letter B).There is, then, utter chaos reigning, since three principal Rulers, Imam, Idrisi and the King of the Hedjaz are trying their hardest to win over these mercenaries who if united form the “ cr^me de la creme ” of the warriors of Ai Yemen; but divided will effect practically nothing—-just energy dis sipated. Copies of letters from the Imam to this Residency and their replies are enclosed (letters C, D, E, F) ; also correspondence with the influential imamic Lieutenant Haj Abdallah al Du main (letters Gr, H and I). It is very important for us to gain the adherence to our cause of Imam Yahya. This the Idrisi would checkmate, for he does not wish his rival to come within the purview of our friendship, lest his own claims south of Lohaiya, which are very nebulous, go by the board. He claims the 'territories held in 18.18 by Sheriff Husein of Abu Arish, and these included tracts as far south as Mokha. It statids to reason with all this wire-pulling that the IdrisFs chances of enlisting Hashid wa Bakil to any appreciable, or useful, extent are very small, and therefore our offer to Hashid wa Bakil through him of £7,000 per tnensem for 5,000 warriors would be so much money thrown into the sea, especially as the latest conditions formulated by Al Shaif (Bakil) to the Idrisi (letter A) are so grasping and far in excess of what this Residency recommended and Government sanctioned. There was in my opinion an initial error committed in tampering with the Hashid wa Bakil for manifestly we can have no control over them once they enter the field, nor could wa guarantee their, steering clear of the Imam Yahya even if the latter held aloof, as he has up to date. Nothing easier for Idrisi then to assert an overt act of hostility by the Imam, and as difficult for us to disprove it at this distance. It is the Imam who after this war will be our strongest potential foe, or friend, and to attempt to wean away his tribesmen will not, I believe, result in getting him off his perch vs. the Turks. If he did come in for us and found the Hashid wa Bakil sequestered, with what troops would he take the field ? Again, if he sees Idrisi trying to win over Hashid wa Bakil, he will at once suspect British Agency and give us straightway the cold shoulder. On the top of all this, as I have above said, we see the edifying spectacle of Saiyid Yahya intriguing on behalf of Sheriff of Mecca! This Yahya did not receive a kindly welcome from Idrisi who rightly scented self-interest in Yahya’s plans and vetoed his proposal to go inland. Yahya accordingly plotted, and got these letters from certain Hashid wa Bakil, over the Idrisi’s head and unbeknown to Idrisi. Tiie Idrisi, so far as this Residency is aware, has not discovered this counterplotting. If he did so, his relations with Aden would be less cordial, as Yahya travelled up to Jizan from Aden and would be considered partly as our spokesman, or acting with our approval. As regards the Rashid tribesmen, it will not be easy for Idrisi to secure them. Nash* Mabkbut has influence, but no Arab Sheikh can command more than a nominal allegiance from his tribesmen. Shahara, the Imam’s chief residence, is situated in the midst of Hashid territory, and here the Imam’s influence is paramount, whatever Nasir may say to the contrary. Nasir is a weather-cock and will desert the Idrisi when he finds it convenient to derive more elsewhere. It is unreasonable to blame the Imam, as Idrisi has done when he stated that despite his treaty with the Turks it was easy for the Imam to break his pledge ana Allah would provide an opening ! Tne Imam is honourable, as Arabs go, and again, his interests tell him that removed far inland it is a very precarious venture for him to oppose the Turks except covertly—whereas the Idrisi who is for some time past anti-Turk, lives near tne sea-board and if attacked can rely on British worships to defend him. Tnese two Rulers are placed in very different situations. My sympa thies go with Imam rather, whose forebears have stoutly disputed with the Turks the mastery of the lemen. The wording of the Resident’s letter to the Idrisi (letter B) while eliminat ing every possible occasion for Idrisi’s charging us with a change of policy,10 will force him to reconsider the recruiting of these Hashid wa Bakil in all ita bearings and will throw on him the onus of securing them on the conditions allowed by Government. In tbe meantime there remains a slight hope of our gaining the Imam’s entrance in the field. Little will be gained by re-approaching him if he declines to accept the present invitation, but if he elects still to hold aloof, his sitting on the fence is not without its advantages, though these are secondary. If then, the Idrisi cannot enlist these mercenaries, we shall not only be saved a useless expenditure of cash, but shall be spared the spectacle of a congeries of tribesmen split up into different camps, allured by varying offers, and offer ing no solid opposition to the Turks. As regards Sheikh Ahmed Musa id Allau of Sabah. He is at heart ,a Zeidi and pro-imam. He carried our last letters to the Imam and brought a reply, and the letters from A1 Dumain. I employed this Sheikh largely from 1904-07 and here in Aden since 1910. He is a “ trimmer ” but at this juncture anxious to oust the Turks. His report brought back from A1 Suda— the Imam’s present residence—shews that the Imam at heart does seek occasion to break away from the Turks. Al Dumain is one of the best of the Imam’s Lieutenants. He visited Aden before the war and carried verbal messages from the Sheriff of Mecca to the Imam. He will be able, if plied with a suitable douceur, to influence the Imam, and we can further play on the avarice of Abdallah bin Ibrahim, the Imam’s confidante and Chief Minister.* Both men will expect some presents, for the Arab lives up to his saw regard ing the omnipotence of cash which is “the tongue of the eloquent and the strong arm of the fighter”. If we can secure Imam Yahya we shall put the Idrisi in his proper place, and secure ourselves from much acrimonious correspondence and serious trouble with the Imam—if the Turks leave the Yemen—and further very greatly damage the prestige in the Yemen of the Turks, who if the Imam seceded would have their retreat cut off. We need not, however, expect to see any two Arabian Chiefs co-operating against the Turks. They will never do more than play each for his own bat. We shall never view the spectacle of “The two Kings smelling at one nosegay ”. Our diplomacy will be successful if we can induce each to move on his own terrain for a common object. Another letter from Idrisi just to hand and marked letter “ K ”. He wants the Hashid wa Bakil to raid the Tihama down to Sheikh Said where he asserts naively that Imam Yahya has no interests. He admits that the demands of Hashid wa Bakil will be high. He does not much care if these tribesmen are enlisted or not so far as his own territories are concerned, but says they would prove very useful on the broader objective. He does not appear to have so far offered any monetary conditions to the Hashid wa Bakil. The Kesident’s reply to Idrisi is marked letter “L ”. One point has not been heretofore adequately considered. I refer to the very easy transfusion of prejudices between Shafi and Z ddi creeds in the Yemen. Many of our Hinterland proteges lean towards the Imam, and more so since the expulsion of Turks from the Yemen is now practicable. 19th March 1917. H. F. Jacob, Lieut.* Colonel, First Assistant Resident, Aden. “A” Dated 2nd Jumad-ul-Awal 1335 (‘24th February 1917). From—S aiyid Mohamed bin Ali bin Idris, The Idrisi, To— Major-General J. M. Stewart, Political Resident, Aden. After compliments .—We have received your esteemed letter of the 27th Rabi-Ul-Thani 1335 (19th February 1917). We have had an interview with your Assistant his honour Captain Beilly and have discussed the matter underreference. It refers to the cementing of friendly relations between the Sheriff of Mecca and ourselves through the medium of our mutual friend Saiyid Mustafa Al-Idrisi. We concurred with him on that point. There was on a previous occasion some conversation with us and Government concerning Hashid and Bakil. They were frequenting our place but we had not then sincere confidence. But now they have expressed the confirmation of their sentiments and that they are prepared to attack the Turks in any direction. They ask for their fixed subsidies from the Turks as well as necessary arma ments as long as they remain under arms. These people might give some considerable service leading to the ousting of the Turks from the whole of the Yemen. We thought it better to expedite sending you this inform ation along with copies of some letters received from them. May you be preserved. P.S. —We have thought it best to send you the originals. They are two documents. We hope that after perusal they may be sent back to us and matters kept secret. Enclosure No. 1 to letter from the Idrisi Saiyid to the Resident of Aden, dated 2nd Jumad Awal 1335 (24th February 1917). From —Yahia bin Yahia Ash-Shaif, the Head Sheikh of Dhu Husein (Bakil), To— Saiyid Mohamed bin Alt bin Idris, The Idrisi. After compliments. —We send you this letter, with our compliments, from Sana after our return from the province of Taiz. The reason for sending this letter to Your Sayada is to inform you that the tribesmen of Hashid wa Bakil are continuing to bolster up and help the family of the House of the apostle of God in the Yemen and the proof of this is stated in both ancient and recent histories. • Turkish. There had been lately a friendly compact between the Government* and the Imam, and in consequence the tribesmen of Hashid and Bakil were put in a quandary and still worse was the neglect of them by the Government and the Imam. They have exercised patience in the matter till they can tolerate no more. This was done out of indulgence for the sake of the Hofise of the apostle of God. The Imam continues up to the present day to collect stores and ammunition and to deprive every Moslem of all share in the same. Mav it not be hidden from your noble self that it has reached our ears that there exists correspondence between you and Hashid and Bakil and that on their visiting you, certain things had taken place. Your servant was expecting to receive some thing from you or to gauge what had resulted. We have now written this letter to you to know if it is your desire that a revolt should be made in the environments of Sana against Government, or rather in the f Taiz ia Headquarttrs of Turks in Lower province of Taiz.f There are in the prO- Yeineu ' vince of Taiz a large number of our tribesmen of Dhu Ghailan ( ). They wield an influence in that quart er against Arabs and non-Arabs. We request you for orders and for what is necessary for, and from, them, i.e., their rights and duties in accordance with the conditions enclosed herewith. We are ready to do our utmost for you in this matter, and this is a fact.

We do not like to come down unneces sarily, because this wdll stain both your character and ours. We want details of what will be given to us and what we shall be necessary to do. We are prepared to place (as a hostage) even one of our sons; but this should have effect at the stage when the matter has reached a working basis, and to receive a benefit we shall come down. You will be responsible and answerable for the same. There should be no change. Hashid and Bakil and ourselves are hand^5* ^3- n in gloves. If you have any desire to get into touch with tl.e Hadratna ut or any ° ^ other place then please note that Dhu* • Bain. Husein are neighbours to the tribesmen of Hashid wa Bakil and Yam and Hadra- t a Hashid clan. maut with the Udhrai,t (if you are agreeable), who are situated in the Lower and Upper Yemen and in the centre of the Hashid and Bakil country. On arrival we shall discuss the matter. If on our return you would approre to l Lieutenants. send any of your MaccadamsJ who are noted for reliabilitv, diplomacy and patience, then he should be in our Com pany and under our care and that of our tribesmen of Dhu Mohamed and Dhu Husein.

After compliments. —I have duly received your esteemed letter, dated 24th February 1917 ( = 2nd Jomad-Awall335), and am very pleased that the inter view you had with Captain Beilly was in every way so satisfactory and that your relations with the Sheriff of Mecca are so good and firmly established. As regards the Hashid wa Bakil, we have no direct or indirect dealings with them, although before the war we had communications from some of the Hashid leaders.At that time we had no reason to come to terms. It is true Sheikh al Sada sent to all and sundry certain proclamations of the Sheriff of Mecca, but we have no further correspondence. The letter Your Excellency has now sent down is from a Bakil Sheikh. What are your dealings with the Hashid wa Eakil as a % whole ? These men as you are aware are merely mercenaries who will go to the one who offers the best reward and therefore their constancy cannot be very remarkable to any one offer. Erom the other paper of conditions Your Excellency has enclosed it seems that the tribe in question is not content with the bare promise of £7,000 per mensem. On the contrary they require further assistance and this if granted will whet their appetite to ask for more. This is but natural, but will only delay action. I presume that you acquainted the tribe with the Government offer. If you can confine them to the original promise and can ensure they will act solely against the Turks and not make the Imam of Sana their objective unless he openly attacks you, well and good, and I await Your Excellency’s final arrangements. This proviso of not stirring up Imam Taliya, without a just cause, has been especially enjoined on me by the Great Government and I cannot swerve from the very decided orders given to me. I have addressed Your Excellency separately rc the matter of the wheels you want for your guns and I trust I may be favoured early with your reply. The accompaniments to your letter are returned as requested. And greetings. No. C.*733, dated Aden Residency, the 18th July 1916. \ From— Major-General J. M. Stewart, C.B., Political Resident, Aden, To—His Excellency the Imam Yahya of Sana. After greetings .—I trust General Waltson’s letter, dated 24th June 1916, has duly reached Your Excellency and that you have read and duly pondered on its contents. You are aware, oh friend, of the present situation in Arabia and of what fortune has attended the venture of our friends the Sheriff of Mecca and the Sayed Idrisi. Mecca and Jeddah and most of Taif are in the hands of the Sheriff and Kunfida has fallen into the Idrisi’s bands. Medina is beleaguered and we trust will soon be in the^ hands of the Sheriff of Mecca. We trust, oh friend, that you will delay no longer in making up your mind to throw off the Turkish yoke and join your brother Arabs in the act of relieving the whole of Arabia from the incubus of Turkish rule. We are aware, oh friend, that for your personal requirements you at present receive a subsidy of £1,000 per mensem from the Turkish Government. I am sure that Your Excellency would not allow a matter of personal incon venience to interfere with your decision in so grave a matter as Arab freedom from the Turkish rule. But our Government would not desire that those who help us should in any way be loosers by such action and I consequently guarantee on their behalf that, in return for your co-operation, a subsidy, similar to that you have enjoyed from the Turks, will be paid to you by them. Should Your Excellency have decided to throw in your lot with the Arab cause, I trust you will intimate me your decision in writing and your accept ance of my Government’s present offer. Lastly, oh friend, may I point out that the present is no time for delay. Delays are dangerous/ Mlinds must be made up quickly and action must at once follow decision. I trust I may be favoured with a speedy and satisfactory reply. May you be preserved.15 “D” (Traise be to God—the Compassionate the Merciful!) Dated 18th A1 Hijja 1334 (16th October 1916). From— Saitid Yahya bin Mohamed Hamid- ad-Din, A1 Mutawakil, the Commander of the faithful, To —Major-General J. M. Stewart, C.B., Political Resident, Aden. After compliments .—We have received your letter and have attentively perused it Up to the time we are writing this, we have received no commu nication other than the copy received through the medium of Sheikh (Sultan) Saleh bin Umar Harhara. We have duly considered all the news detailed by Sultan Abdul Karim. May God decree what he wishes and chooses (to be enforced). The reason which hinders us from taking action is not due to timidity of the fight, impotency or awaiting the result of victory; neither is it due to riches to be derived or silver or gold which we seek. Albeit the fighting that continued for several years in the past is already known and has given fame to the persever ance and bravery which our soldiers and supporters have shewn in the scenes of war. Praise he to God, they are to-day much stronger and more intrepid than ever; their words correspond with their deeds in their obedience to us. The intentions of their hearts do not check them from being submissive to us nor the false rumours make them swerve from executing our honourable commands, either in the north or to the south. We are aware that the Great British Government have extensive resources, and their liberality is the best to be gained. However, you know that the pact, which was concluded between the Ottoman Government and ourselves which they (Turks) have hitherto observed faithfully and adhered to in a satisfactory manner, is the cause which from a religious point of view we could not find a way to violate. God the Almighty has said “ Oh Believers fulfil the pacts you undertake ” and further “ so long as they (the non-Moslims of the Arabs of Kuraish) are faithful to the convention they made with you, you should be faithful to them”. It is for this reason we have kept quiet and aloof, though we lose interests which thousands (of men), i.e. 9 those less worthy than ourselves could never hope to acquire (and this we do) for the sake of the fulfilment of the engagements which we owe to every one that we may escape the wrath of God that would fall on the disobedient. We wish to be treated with consideration as we have consideration for others, and to be regarded with sound mi nd and fair judgment by Eulers. The course which we would adopt should be such, that the general public could appreciate and serve as a ladder to effect the regeneration of the country which was demoralised by the long-standing fights which lasted for nearly half a century. Again that we may cause improve ments in this country and restore its wealth to an appreciable degree. our hope in obtaining these wishes not be disappointed, nor our action fall short of the appreciation of persons who are endowed with nobility and perfection of wisdom ! And to God we pray for the fulfilment of our wishes. “E” No. C.-858, dated Aden Residency, the 7th September 1916. From—L ieutenant-Colonel H. F.

You are aware that, in spite of whac our enemies may say, we are the best friends of Islam. f16 The bearer of this letter is Sheikh Ahmed Musa’id Allan.

A fter compliments .—We have received your letter, dated 9th Al ki da 1334 (7th September 1916) by the hand of Sheikh Ahmed Musa’id Allan and fully considered it. You have known of the regard we have for the Great British Government as well as the regard maintained by our ancestors towards them. You also know of the fights which took ^ place in Yemen in the past between the espousers of our cause and the officials of the Ottoman Govern ment. After all this friendship has been established between the Ottoman Government and ourselves and the sanguinary fights came to an end. Then the general war broke out in different parts of the world during which time we have been true to our faith to them (Turks) and yet the while we have had regard for British Government, and kept quiet. It was expected that the magnanimous British Government would have shewn consideration for the inhabitants of this country wTio have suffered destruction in the former wars, and would rot have shut the doors against their livelihood from the sea although the product of their country might be sufficient to provide them with foods and other requirements. The roads, however, have been closed and the cold shoulder given to such people who have shewn no hostile attitude towards Government at all. The benefit from the imports are derived by the sellers and buyers, and the fight has no connection with goods imported to, or from, the Yemen. Anyhow, we have said “all well” (i.e., acquiesced). We hope, however, that due consideration and justice will be given to our representation, as behoves Government. As to the allusion to the agreement that existed between our ancestors and the British Government in the year 1821 A. D. which you have mentioned, we inform you that a long time has passed and many changes and fearful events have meanwhile occurred, and the capital of our honourable Imamate had likewise been transferred, as you well know. It is difficult for us to find trace of the circumstance mentioned by you at present. If possible for you to send us a copy of the agreement, we shall consider the matter and let you know after due consideration. This will be better. We crave help from God. May He guide us to the right path. * True translation. H. F. Jacob, Lieutenant-Colonel, (First Assistant Resident, Aden. “ G ” No. C.-3 80, dated Aden Residency, the 12th March 1917. From— Major-General J. M. Stewart, C.B., Political Resident, Aden, To— Imam Yahya of Sana. After compliments.—-1 was pleased to get Your Excellency’s letter, dated 18th Al Hijja 1334 (16th October 1916) and one, dated 8th Babi al Awwal1215 (1st December 1916), to address of Colonel Jacob which was brought down by Sheikh Ahmed Musa’id Allan, and have fully understood your mean ing. It may be difficult for you to oppose the Turks, but it seems to me that there is a psychological moment for every event for as God has said in His Book. Every time has its prescribed fulfilment. 2. You will have heard of our victories in A1 Irak,® the capture of . „ . . 5,000 of the enemy, and their heavy e*o P o amm. casualties to the extent of 20,000 killed and wounded and their disorderly retreat on Baghdad ; and of our regaining Kut and the capture by us of guns and large stores and the sinking of many of their river-boats. This is the decree of God. The Germans are also being gradually pushed back in France by ourselves and the French, while the troops of Germany, Austria, Turkey and Bulgaria have received a check against the armies of Russia and Roumania. Italy also is progressing against the Austrians. The great war cannot last much longer and it is time for Your Excellency to review the situation and consult your best interests. Great Britain is the nearest friend of Islam. I think Your Excellency know this fact. We seek no aggrandisement. We would have every Arab Chief independ ent and ruling in his own borders, and all friendly with the British the Bower—who by God’s decree does administer the affairs of a greater number of Moslems than any other Power on Earth. Egypt and India are secure and flourishing under our administration. This is from God and not a matter for boasting, when we say that the Moslem world can make the best progress when allied with England, since we offer them free and unrestricted worship according to their own rites. 3. Your Excellency will note from a perusal of the enclosed paper that your ancestor had very friendly relations with us in 1821 A. D., and in 1848 the reveied Imams of Sana had many times friendly recourse to us in Aden. 4. Your Excellency has asked us to open the Arabian ports to a free supply of food. This is our earnest desire, but unless our Arab friends assist us by opposing the Turks, such a consummation is not possible. If Your Excellency will follow the example set by Sheriff Husein of Mecca and the Idrisi Saiyid, the way will be open for us to accede to your request. Other Arabs are calling on us to assist them to throw off the Turkish yoke and to capture the Turkish garrisons situated in the various ports, but hitherto we have for borne to act. The presence at these places of Turkish garrisons is a standing menace to us and we cannot endure their menace much longer. It is for Your Excellency to act at once and relieve the situation. The wise man looks to the future. 5. We have already assured you of our bounty if you join us. We again repeat the offer of pecuniary and monthly assistance to yourselves and tribes. These are not the empty “ promises of Urkub ”. If Your Excellency is pre pared to meet us, I would advise you losing no time in sending down a reliable go-between to whom we will give full honours in Aden. The Arab poet Zuhair has finely said :— « He who does not defend his cistern with strong arms will see it de molished “ And he who abstains from injuring others will often himself be injured”; and again the same poet has sung :— “ Chiefs, exalted in the high ranks of Maad ! May you be led into the paths of felicity ” 1 “The man who opens for his country a treasure of glory should him self be glorified ” ! This is the time, oh friend, for action, for “the gathering from the tree is not obtained by sitting still”. Your reply is awaited.18 &lt;■ H ” Dated 16th Rabi Awal 1385 (10th January 1917).

Your good wishes towards right and justice is evident and is well known in all parts of the country and we have put all matters dearly to our Lord (the Imam) so much so that he became altogether inclined (towards you). His letter will corroborate our statement. God willing the words will be substantiated by acts. The esteem of men will be known from tne result ot their doings. We are not of those whom you know from their nice words though devoid of action; neither are we of those who seek for wealth and money with any forthcoming advantage in view. Lies are the weakness of men and tend to dishonour, especially in the case of those who devote them selves to religion and are men of wisdom. You have already fathomed our nature from the discussion* which took • Before the war and in Aden. place between you and us on certain subjects and knew our sincere intention and fair inclination. It was our intention to write you an elaborate account dealing with our several matters jn full detail, but this our letter cannot accommodate. These matters are concerning arrangements between the inhabitants of this country and our selves which are strictly confidential; at any rate on the return of our messenger from your side, bringing us such instructions as to what is required to be done by us, we shall explain to you everything in full detail. In brief, the energy of men removes mountains. We have perused the manifesto (the letter) to our eminent Lordt and his reply is herewith sent. Matters are + Imam ' pledged to their suitable times. In case we receive such instructions as can be executed, together with a letter from our master, and such instructions as the necessary explanation and assistance required for the present and future exigencies for the collection of forces and war materials and for the use of sturdy men—then the banners of war will be spread throughout the country by the men who are efficient to handle their weapons and fight—men with whom we possess influence. Your reply will be acted upon and taken as an authority. God has the privilege of giving success. True translation. j3. F.

After our return from your part we have made pacifications in accordance with your wishes. We send you Ahmed Musa’id in order that he may obtain your proposals which—God willing—may be assuring (and workable). We have addressed to some brothers letters in brief without entering into details, but we have explained fully in our special letters. Let us know quickly.

From —Saiyid Muhammad bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Idbis, The Idrisi, To— Major-General J. M. Stewart, C.B., Political Resident, Aden. After compliments. —We are in receipt of your esteemed letter of the 33th Jumad-ul-Awwal (7th March 1917). Our relations with the Sheriff of\\ Mecca are, as a matter of fact, the same as stated by you. Our mutual inclination towards waging war against the iniquitous Turks has joined ns together. _ We understand from Your Excellency’s letter that there was no particular correspondence between you and tbe Hashid and Bakil. At the same time you ask us to let you know of the fact of our relations with them With regard to the geographical position of our country and the measuies for its defence, we inform you that we are independent of the ^ services of .the Hashid and Bakil but in the event of a rapid march being made against Turkish territory such as Lohaiya, Hodeida and Bab-el-Mandeb and especially if it were necessary to proceed against the Turkish Hill positions, it would be incumbent to employ mercenaries for operations in the direction ot Asir. After the withdrawal from Kunfida the Turks brought pressure to bear upon the people and at the same time carried away Sheikhs and notables from there as hostages as a result the country has become so strong that it cannot be taken except with a strong force. Such hirelings in our part of the world TJ .. , T can he secured from among Hashid, - ^ They M^pro^urk!^ ^ 01Q ^ to ^ risl or ^ mam * Yara * and Kahtan. ^ Although / H. F. Jacob. sucd jg the case, we have not asked - A ^ Hashid and Bakil to come to us; hut they are inclined towards us since long time. As Saiyid Yahya el Mutaw-wif who had recently been here from Aden had informed them that (your) Government was enquiring of them and was keen to know of them,* they have written to us as you are already aware. Their requirements are two-fold :— (1) It will be necessary to assign subsidies to some of the important personages amongst them w r ho were accustomed to receive subsi dies from the Turks and who will be responsible to heat up for mercenaries. We imagine that such subsidies would approxi mately amount to $10,000 per month. (2) Special wages for hirelings during the continuance of war. Every foot and mounted soldier should receive from $10 to 15 and 20 to 25 dollars per mensem, respectively. These emoluments exclude their rations. Others than Hashid and Bakil will not he secured, hut by the payment of larger sums. At the present juncture Hashid and Bakil are not disinclined. It fs clear that the aim of Government is to expel the Turks from the country. We have, on several occasions, discussed this point but now we have the opportunity in our hands. As these people are men of self-respect,f they might turn us the cold shoulder if they found themselves so treated. Their enlistment is necessary if the object is the ejectment of the Turks. In re Imam Yahya: His territory has no concern with the matter at issue. His is a country well-defined, distinct, and we do not desire it. Our past fights with him did not, in the main, aim at occupying his territory ; and our present object, rather, is to bring pressure to bear upon him in the event of his rendering help to the Turks. At the present time our goal is the tract of '1 ihama^X and lmam§ Yahya has no concern with it. i f i.e., avnricious people who have already scented Idrisi gold. H. F. Jacob. J i.e, the Yemen low lands. § Imam Yahya thinks quite otherwise. H. F. Jacob. You state that being mercenaries the Hashid and Bakil would go to the highest bidder and that therefore no reliance should be placed on them. Please note that to obviate such a contingency we are going to compel them to give up their sons as hostages as long as it is necessary. True translation. H. F.

After compliments. —Your valued letter, dated Idtli Jumad-al-Awwal 1335 (7th March 1917) to hand. The main point for settlement is that of the recruitment of the Hashid wa Bakil. If you can enlist these men and utilise them to the best advantage, you know I am awaiting the result of your deliberations with them. You understand now I am Sure, that provided these tribesmen actually do honest work for you, and if you can guarantee that no attack will be made by these men against Imam Taliya unless he actively attacks you, then, note that the British Government is prepared to give you £7,000 per mensem for the purpose of expelling the Turks. Your best objective, I think, is against Lohaiya and Asir.^ I do not think it advisable for Your Excellency to go south to ELodeida. This will mean a dissipation of energy : whereas what is required is concentration of energy. Your Excellency is clearly a foe to Turks. TV e have realised this all along. Now Sheriff Husein has followed your example. We want to get the Imam Yahya on our side and your’s—for all the Arab Chiefs should participate each in his own and nearest sphere. Imam Yahya has had an interest in the Tihama of the Yemen before the Turks returned to Yemen in 1873 A.D., and so we do not advise, on this ground also, that you should go so far afield as Hodeida—even though this place and .tract is now in Turkish hands. You will remember, oh friend, that decisions regarding the several pos sessions of territory, as previously pointed out, should await the termination of hostilities. As already intimated to Your Excellency, we shall he glad to assist you against Lohaiya by sea, whenever you are ready for our co-operation. Our mutual friend Sheriff Hamood has explained matters to us and we are glad to have seen him here. He has seen the sand-tyres and learnt how they fitted to the wheels. We have only seven in stock of the kind he requires and we also ourselves use. Considerable time will pass before more can be prepared. The Sheriff Hamood, however, will take these seven tyres hack with him and we shall then await your report on their working. As regards his other requirements, we are doing our best to facilitate their supply, hut in these days of war, the ordinary requirements obtainable in peace-time are not now readily forthcoming.

Quotation stating reply from Faisal that I bn Rashid has left Hail for Medina. It hardly seems probable. Latest news from Bin Sand himself, dated 12th May, is to the effect that Ibn Rashid had invited him to make peace, bat he replied that he could not do so without ascertaining our wishes. Re adds that as far as he is concerned he would prefer to keep him at bay, but that it appears in [Hedjaz ?] interests to bring him over to us. Independent reports from desert assert that peace has already been made. Ibn Hadhdhal, who is here, suggests that Ibn Rashid is merely imposing on Bin Sand in order to gain time and obtain supplies, but Storvs, who is just starting from Koweit, will report actual position, and we can then decide on action to be taken and nature of terms which we may be prepared to give to bring Ibn Rashid over if his intentions are serious.{Addressed to Foreign, repeated to Secretary of State for India and Arbur, Cairo.) (Received at India Office 3.15 p.m.) Reference to Secretary of State’s telegram dated LMtli A larch. We have not yet been able to establish effective touch with tribal Sheikhs of northern Mesopotamia and western Syrian desert. On Euphrates line the Delaim with headquarters at Rumadi are still dominated b\ Turks and actively hostile, while above us on Tigris, the enemy control channels of communication in that direction. As legai ds Amzah Amarat, Tahad Reg has been m friendly comniuni- cation with Sand es Saleh and on 17th March told him to inform “his friend ” (that is Leachman) “ to let Baghdad know lie would agree to what is necessary.” He apparently still hesitates to send letters here in case of accidents, but he is now moving northwards towards Kerbela and we shall no doubt soon be in touch with him. lie is reported on good authority to have summarily rejected a recent proposal from Ajaimi Saadoon to pay him a visit. As regards the Rualleh according to report received from 4»Tnwim4 ibn Saleh Subhan, dated 1st week in April, Nawwaf Shaalan has under pressure from Turkish Government arrived at an understanding with Ibn Rashid. This needs confirmation. Letters from Ismail Beg are being sent to Weiranshehr and llachim Muhaid and the Aqaidat Sheikh on Khabur. News received from Ibn Sand by letter up to the end of March. He was then in Qasim and his brother Abdur Rahman on. the Qasim Hail border. There had recently been a conflict between bin Rashid’s tribes and the Harb and 1 hitman under bin Sand and the latter claimed to have killed 40 men and captured 200 horses. Bin Rashid was said *to have retired to Salma. The season has arrived for large caravans from Hail to visit Najaf and vicinity for supplies. We have not at present sufficient hold over tribes on lower Euphrates between Najaf and Samawa to enal.de us to make sure of preventing this, but we are pressing our friends at Najaf on one hand to refuse access and Sand Ibn Saleh on the other to endeavour to intercept the caravans on the way or from Hail. At present a caravan of 5,000 camels is reported to have reached Ain-al-Saiyid, five hours from Najaf.

After my last letter had been despatched Abdul Aziz Bin Saud consulted me as to what was to be done with these four men, awaiting him in Buraidah* He said that as they certainly carried letters from the Porte he would have to see them sooner or later and until he did see them he could not exactly ascertain their mission. I agreed that no object ?70uld be served by leaving them indefinitely in Buraidah, where they might find opportunity for intrigue; he accordingly had them summoned to his camp* 3. On arrival the deputation proved to consist of three Ulema, Wahabis resident in Baghdad, who had been forced by Djavid Pasha to form the deputation much against their will and were instructed to preach a 'Jihad'; the fourth member proved to be Haji Bakar Bey, a Major in the Turkish Army, a Kurd from Mosul district by birth and an adherent of the Committee party in policies; his duty ostensibly was the instruction of Bin Baud's Arabs m the art of modern war but his real mission was that of spy on trie Ooher members of the deputation. The deputation left Baghdad immediate ly after the British occupation of Basrah and travelled via Damascus and the Kedjaz Railway to Medina and thence to Buraidah. They brought with them copies of the 'Fatwa' issued by tne Shaikh al-Islam in Constantinople enjoining a religious war and were instructed to bring about peace between Bin Saud and Ibn Rashid, inducing them to move their combined forces against the British t r00 DS in Mesopotamia. I enclose a copy of a documenu upon wnich in my presence and before a 'Majlis' of his headmen 'Bin Saud' commented caustically and particularly on the fact that though issued by the supposed head of Islam to other Moslems it did not ' *'])ear gvqd. tlie usual ano. necGSsa, ar-Kahman ar-Raliini n .

The deputation after two days in camp were dismissed and left yesterday on their return to Buraidah ana Medina, with the intimation that Ihn Rashid having Been located with a large hostile force within two days' march peace Between the two AraB chiefs was impossible. 4. It will Be of interest to add that the head of the deputation was Saiyid Mahmud Bhakri Alusi, a well-known Alim of Baghdad. Bin Saud informed me that in a private conversation with the Baiyid the latter expressed Bitter condemnation of the Turks and said that the people of Baghdad would gladly welcome freedom xrom Turkish misrule; he would gladly have met me But the presence of the Turkish officer made any/intercourse impossible and he feared reprisals on his family in Baghdad should the British troops not have already occupied the city before the return ox the deputation. 5.

Shakespear, I.A., political Officer on Special Duty, Camp XXII, Central Arabia, to the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, Basrah. With reference to para four of my letter No. S-13, dated the 4th January 1915 I have the honour to report that 'Bin Baud's' preparations for his campaign against 'Ibn Rashid' are now complete. 2. 'Ibn Rashid' with some 600 or 700 townsmen and a large force of Shammar tribesmen has been located near Ajibba wells on the Kuwait-Buraidah road and distant some 25 miles from this camp. 'Bin Sand' has now some 6000 townsmen and the whole of the Ajman, Umtair and Harb tribes of Bedouin camped here. He has also called up the Sbi'a and Sahool but it is doubtful whether they will arrive in time. 3. It is probable that 'Bin Baud' will march one more day to a camp some 15 miles further on north-west and will attack thence a day or two later. Ihe result irom the information available appears to be almost certain victory for : 'Bin Baud'. I propose to accompany the Amir's camp ana remain with him pending further instructions. P.S.

Bin Saud enquired from mt what he should reply and what reply would he most advantageous to His Majesty ’ s Government*, 3. A ” Jihad” especially if proclaimed at Mecca by one of the Sfcarif’s standing in Islam, is c, contingency of which the consequences are unforeseeable and incalculable such a proclamation would at least raise the whole iirao world and Bin Saud himself would he compelled by the circumstances of his faith, his prestige and position as an Arab Chief to follow with all his tribes, ihis contingency -- a * Jihad 1 ' proclaimed by the acknowledged and accepted descendant of the Prophet at Mecca -- I venture to submit needs the must serious consideration and to be constantly kept in mind at the present critical time in all our deal ings with Arab Chiefs in general and Bin Baud in particular. FortunatelyA rortunately throu^i Bin Sdud’s commanding influence in Arabia, and if His Majesty’s Government are prepared to meet Lis desires generously, we are in a position so to limit the danger as to make it almost negligible. It was with these thoughts in my mind that I proceeded to discuss the Sharif’s letter with Bin Saud, 4* I oola nim that Lis Majesty ’s G-ovemment had been forced into war by Germany and that Germany had than forced war between i'urkey and Great Britain as had alreoxiy been explain ed to him and that the last thing which His Majesty ’ s Govern ment desired was any further extension of that war. He had seen the British attitude towards Islazp and its Holy Places explained in the Viceroy’s Proclamation and must be aware from his own previous knowledge that non-interference with any religion was a cardinal feature of British policy* He had himself been sufficiently convinced of British sincerity in this war to help materially, by temporising with the Turks to prevent further extension of it in Arabia, and by his lead and example to assist our campaign in Mesopotamia. While certain assurances had been vouchsafed to him I had no authority to offer anything of a similar nature to the Sharif. However, Great Britain, on behalf of the vast number of her Indian Moslem subjects, on whom pilgrimage to the Holy Places was an incumbent as on all Islam, could, not remain uninterested in the attitude of the Sharif of Mecca, consequently it was obvious tne.t ijer benevolence or m&lt;iif — ferenee would probably e commensurate with the treatment accorded to Ii dian Moslems at the Holy Places. I believed (and Bin Baud concurred in this) that in decca and Medina the Sharif’s word probably carried far more weight than that of the local Turkish authorities — therefore it behoved the Sharif to use his best influence for peace if he desired the benevolence or countenance of His Majesty’s Government. So far as one could, euess at the future Turkey as a GreatG-rso-t Power w&amp;s (iocm id - whether the Sultan' iu-abia and the iioly Places was also doomed was a matter for the Arabs themselves, but it was clear from the Viceroy's Pr uclfeiaation that the Fritish Government had no designs on u..e ...uly nluc s and has even hound themselves as well a a the French arid Pus si an Governments, to take no military action against them and Jeddah provided that Indian Moslems were net molested. It seemed to me therefore advisable for txxe Siioxii m his own interests to continue to temporize aitn the iurks while Bin Gaud would he further assisting his Majesty’s Government and improving his own chances of a. satisfactory arrangement with them if he advised him the Sharif wi th x V. ~ m . u.' .ie x t&gt; His Maje sty V V a Sa •tisf act c*/Gbv 02 . &lt;. iH^iy 5 .

K e RELATIONS WITH IBN SA’DI). Note prepared by Arab Bureau, Irak Section • Nbdnl Aziz Ibn Sa nd; the present Hakim of Najd, may he said to have, begun his reign in 1901, when he was proclaimed Governor of Riyadh by his father, Abdul Rahman. The Sa'ud family were at that time in exile, having been driven out of their dominions in 1891 by their hereditary ' !? e f ! b a l R f 1 hld - ln Aziz, with the help of Mubarak Ibn pa bah, bhaikh of Kuwait, recovered Riyadh iii a daring raid which he led in person, and by 190b he had so-far re-established the old supremacy of of Hail the Sa’ud as to carry hostilities to the 0 succeeding his return to Riyadh he acted m close alliance with^i^ Shaddi of Kuwait, who had every reason for desiring the curtailing of Rashid influence, lor the Rashid were allies and, in a remote acceptation of the term, vassals of the Ottoman Empire, subsidised and backed by Constanti nople, and they lepiesented m Arabia the 1 urkish polic} 7 of centralisation which the Shaikh was covertly resisting in his own territories. His geographical position on the shores of the Persian Gulf had placed him in relations with the British Government; since 1899 we had had a friendly understanding with him, and had promised to support him against Ottoman aggression. But the existence of this connection made us unwilling to see him drawn into the confused and uncertain feuds of the interior; and acting on the principle laid down in 1891 that we were not disposed to mteifeie inoie than was necessary for the maintenance of gene ml peace m the lersian Gulf, we had discouraged him from embroiling himself in Central Arabian affairs. Ibn Sa’ud, in spite of his growing importance, was outside the limits of our interest, thus appointed, and it was not until 1911 that special attention was drawn to him in our official reports. In that year Captain Shakespear, the Political Agent at Kuwait, while on tour, met him by chance in the desert and was hospitably entertained in his camp. Ibn Sa’ud expressed to him a desire to be received into a recognised relationship with Great Britain ; he referred to Colonel Pelly’s visit to Riyadh in 1865, and to the overtures made to us by his father, ’Abdul Rahman, in 1904, when a British Agent was first appointed to Kuwait, l ie spoke in strong terms of the hatred which the Arabs entertained for the Turks and of his own resentment of their occupation of the Hasa, a province which he was particularly anxious to regain, not only because'it formed part of his ancestral dominions, but also because it would give him access to the sea and control over the tribes from Riyadh to the coast. He regarded with grave apprehension the aggressive policy of the new regime in Turkey, and would welcome, if he recovered the Hasa, a British Agent in one of his ports ; and he added that our trade would benefit fronpthe increased security which he would maintain on the caravan routes. Captain Shakespear could make no other rejoinder than that the British Government confined its interests to the coast, and had never challenged Turkish claims to the ordering of affairs in Central Arabia, with which we had no concern ; that we were, moreover, on amicable terms with Turkey and should be averse from anything in the nature of intrigue against the Ottoman Govern ment ; but in his comments on. the report of this interview, Sir Percy Cox pointed out that as the Porte seemed disposed to be intractable in the adjustment of matters relating to British interests in the Gulf, we could not afford to ignore Ibn Sa’ud’s attitude. . His personal authority had greatly increased and it would be well to entertain cordial if distant relations with him. The Foreign Office, however, decided that it was impossible at that time to swerve from our policy of strict non-interference. 2. Two years later Ibn Sa’ud, without the assistance which he had tried to obtain from us, though he was credited throughout Arabia with having s ;io 2/18 Asecured it, overran the-Hasa, ejected without difficulty the small Turkish garrisons and established himself on the coast at Qatif and O jair. Captain Shakespear, on his return to England in June 1914 from a long projected journey across Arabia, in the course of which he had visited Riyadh, bore witness to the strong personal domination which Ibn Sa’ud’s vigorous and commanding personality had established, and from other reports it was clear that he was regarded beyond iris own frontiers as the coming man. He proved more than a match for the ineffective efforts of the Turks to retake the Hasa: they resorted to diplomacy and opened negotiations with him through Saiyid Talib of Basrah. Early in May Tal’at Beg had formulated in private eonversationr at the British Embassy the expectations of the Ottoman Government in terms which seemed to his hearers little consonant with actual conditions. He proposed to establish a strictly delimited frontier between Ibn Sa’ud and Ibn Rashid, place representatives of the Sultan at Riyadh and at Hail, and rely upon the guile of these officials to control without the aid of force the actions of the two Amirs. As * for the Hasa, Ibn Sa’ud would be appointed Mutasarrif of the province, but the collection of the Customs would remain in Turkish hands and Turkish garrisons would be replaced in the ports. 3. Nothing was more certain than that Ibn Sa’ud’s appearance on the coast must ultimately bring him into direct contact with ourselves, whether we welcomed it or sought to avoid it ; and this anxiety underlay and possibly accelerated the action of the Porte. But at the moment Turkish fears were groundless. We were concerned wholly with the conclusion of prolonged negotiations with Constantinople, touching interests in Mesopotamia and the Gulf which were of vital importance, and were less inclined, if possible, than before for Arabian adventure. We made a friendly offer of mediation which was refused, and when in April 1914 the Amir met the British Agent, Colonel Grey, outside Kuwait, he was given to understand that we had recently concluded a comprehensive agreement with Turkey and could hold out to him no hope of support. Ibn Sa’ud was thrown back on his own resources, but these were considerable, and the secret treaty which was signed in May by himself and the Wali of Basrah fell short of Tal’at Beg’s anticipations. He accepted the title of Wali and Military Commandant of Najd which was offered to himself and bis descendants as long as they should remain loyal, and engaged to fly the Turkish flag, but he was to have charge of the Customs on behalf of the Ottoman Government, raise his own levies and provide the garrisons - for Qatif and Ojair. Deficiencies in the Najd budget were to be met from the Customs, and no revenue from any local income was to be paid to Constantinople until such time as there was a surplus, an eventuality of doubtful occurrence. But while exercising in his own territories an authority which was in all but the name that of an inde pendent ruler, his correspondence with foreign Powers was to’ be conducted solely through the Porte, and in case of war he was to come to the assistance of the Sultan. 4. What would have been the upshot of a treaty which so imperfectly reflected the convictions of the contracting parties can scarcely admit of doubt. The guiding trait of Ibn Sa’ud’s character is what must be called a racial rather than a national patriotism, but this sentiment was not likely to evoke sympathetic consideration from the leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress, who were blindly determined on the Ottomanization of the Arabs. As a strict Wahabi, the new Wali of Najd looked with abhorrence on the loose religious principles -of the Turks and was far from admitting their pretensions to represent and direct Islam. He had, in conversation with Captain Shakespear, spoken with unexpected vehemence on this point, saying that in his eyes the Infidel was preferable to the Turk, since the latter broke the rule he professed to follow while the former acted in accordance with his own law : and to the same listener he declared that he had accepted the terms of the agreement only because he was assured privately that even the small measure of sovereignty accorded to Turkey would never be claimed. The Kuwait treaty was put to the test bv the outbreak of European war and found wanting.5. The disquieting attitude adopted by Turkey on the outbreak of war between Germany and the Entente Powers produced a profound alteration in our policy towards the Porte. It became necessary to reckon up our assets in Arabia, and early in October Captain Shakespear, who was in England, was ordered to return to the Persian Gulf and get into touch with Ibn Sa’ud, so as to prevent, if possible, the-outbreak of unrest in the interior, and in the event of war with Turkey to ensure that no assistance should be rendered from that quarter. Before he could reach his destination war had been declared. A message had been despatched to Ibn Sa’ud informing him of Captain Shakespear s impending visit, recognising his position in Najd and the Hasa_ and guaranteeing him against reprisals by sea or land if he would commit himself to enter the lists against Turkey. The Turks, on their side, lost no time in approaching the Amirs of Central Arabia. Their scheme, which was that Ibn Rashid should aid in the campaign ao-ainst Egypt while Ibn Sa’ud opposed the British advance in Mesopotamia, showed that they were as unaware of the feeling toward them which prevailed among the Arabs as they were ignorant of the conditions of the desert, where the network of tiibal feud permits no man to withdraw his forces on a distant expedition without fear of attack on his unprotected possessions. Ibn Sa’ud, apparently in order to gain time, took advantage of his abiding enmity with Ibn Rashid and launched into open hostilities against him. In vain Enver Pasha urged him to abandon private quarrels, sent him a gift of money for the expenses of co-operation with the Sultan’s armies, and ultimately entrusted Saiyid Talib with the task of bringing about a reconciliation. At this juncture Saiyid Talib was busily engaged in endeavouring, through the intermediation of Shaikh Khaz’al and His Majesty’s Consul at Muhammarah, to drive a bargain with the British Government providing for his adherence to us in the event of war with Turkey, but the terms which lie put forward were so extravagant as to be impossible of acceptance, and he was still hesitating over Shaikh Ivhaz’al’s advice to him to abate them when the declaration of war left him stranded. Then it was that he saw in his proposed deputation to Najd a providential means of escape from Basrah, where his position had now become highly precarious, and he left hurriedly for Ibn Sa’ud’s camp, via Zubair. Mean while the Wahabi Chief, in response to Turkish exhortation, had pleaded that he could spare no troops for the ’Iraq till he had reduced Ibn Rashid to his rightful state of vassalage. To the British message he replied that he was unshaken in his long-standing desire for intimate relations with us. But lie was not unnaturally reluctant to take open part with us until he was satisfied that our change of front towards himself was likely to be permanent, and in spite of his personal confidence in Captain Shakespear it was with some misgiving that he consented to his visit. The meeting took place on 31st December at Khufsah, near Majma’, in Sudair. Ibn Sa’ud spoke with great frankness. Before compromising himself wholly with the Turks he asked that our assurances of support should be embodied in a formal treaty, the terms of which were drafted forthwith. They included a guarantee of complete independence on our part and an undertaking on the part of Ibn Sa’ud that he would have no dealings with other Powers except after reference to the British Government. He informed Captain Shakespear that he had been in communication with the Sharif and with the heads of the northern ’Anazah confederation, and that they were resolved to stand together. He was holding in detention a party of four envoys sent by the Turks to urge him to join Ibn Rashid in a Jihad against us, but after consultation with Captain Shakespear the Turkish mission was dismissed with the reply that Ibn Rashid’s forces were camped within two days of Ibn Sa’ud and that there could now be no question of peace between them. On 17th January a messenger arrived from Mecca bearing a letter from the Sharif’s son ’Abdullah, who wrote that the Sharif had been called upon to proclaim the Jihad and was temporising till he heard what line Ibn Sa’ud proposed to take. Ibn Sa’ud made answer that he saw no advantage to the Arabs in joining the Ottoman Government and had himself dismissed a Turkish deputation empty-handed. G. Upon the reports sent by Captain Shakespear from Ibn Sa’ud’s camp, Sir Percy Cox was authorised to proceed with the negotiations for the treaty.4 Tout on January battle was joined between Ibn Sa’nd and Ibn Rashid, ' and Captain Shakespear, unarmed and present only as a spectator, met his death. Ibn Sand’s version of the disaster was that he was shot dead by a Shammar rifle-bullet, but this statement is in any case based only on second hand information, as it is undisputed that Captain Shakespear had taken up a position in a different part of the field from that where his host was located. Since then various and divergent accounts of what happened have been recited, one of little more value than another, but the balance of evidence goes to show that he was first wounded in the leg and disabled, and soon afterwards killed in the charge of Ibn Rashid’s cavalry, which, overwhelmed the flank on which he was posted. In the saave qui pent which ensued it is feared that he was either abandoned or forgotten, but the precise circumstances of his untimely death will probably never be ascertained. Ibn Sa’ud expressed profound regret for the loss of one whom he regarded as a brother, and always refers to him with respect and affection. 7. The action was indecisive : both parties claimed the victory, and both were tempoiarily crippled and forced to retire. It was an unexpected and ‘ a somewhat disconcerting result, for Ibn Sa’ud's preparations had been made on an exceptional scale and Iris forces were s'aid largely to outnumber those of Ibn Rashid, though he was inferior in cavalry. The accounts given by the Arabs attribute his defeat to the treachery of the ’Ajman. Ibn Sa’ud’s personal courage is beyond question, but he not uncommonly falls short as a tactician, and Mubarak of Kuwait pronounced him to be a poor leader in battle. But if he had not dealt Ibn Rashid a crushing blow he had at least put him out of action and prevented him from joining the Turks, as lie unquestionably would have done. The intervention of Ibn Rashid in the early part of the Mesopotamian campaign might have added considerably to our difficulties., Nevertheless, Captain Shakespear’s death was a heavy price to pay for the advantage of immobilising him. i ‘ ' . . 8. The two Chiefs held apart without further hostilities till the summer, when an agreement dated IOth June was concluded between them. Ibn Rashid recognised Ibn Sa’ud’s claims, except that of overlordship, which he could scarcely be expected to acknowledge, and undertook not to play a treacherous game towards the Turkish Government, but to incline towards whichever Government was in alliance with Ibn Sa’ud. tie confined his own jurisdiction to Hail and its villages and the Shammar tribes, while Ibn Sa’ud was aeknowdedged to hold all Najd from Al Khahaf to Dawasir. A1 Khahaf is no doubt the Kahafah of Hunter’s map, a little north of latitude 27°. In a tribal country the adjustment of frontiers can never be very exact, but it is clear that Ibn Rashid renounced ail pretensions to the Qasim, a province whose rich oases had frequently changed hands. It is of interest to note that the tribes reckoned as subject to Ibn Sa’ud are the Mutair, ’Ataibah, Harb, Bani ’Abdullah, ’Ajman, Murrah, Manasir, Bani Hajar, Subai’, Salmi! Q an tan and Dawasir ; but this catalogue must not be taken as exact, for the Mutair aie mostly in Kuwait territory, and the ’Ataiban and Harb come for the greater part under the Sharif. 9. After Captain Shakespear’s death Ibn Sa’ud sent an immediate request that another officer should be accredited to him, or, failing this, that negotiations should continue through his agent in Basrah, ’Abdul’ Latif Mandil. No suitajjle officer was available, but Ibn Sa’ud was advised to sign a preliminary agreement on the lines of Captain Shakespear’s draft and leave all details to be settled later. He signed and returned the new draft Avhich had been sent to him, but with some important modifications, con- ceining which it seemed better to postpone further discussion till a meeting with the Chief Political Officer could be arranged. For the time, therefore, the conclusion of the treaty was suspended, Ibn Sa’ud being wholly engaged with internal affans. His position at home at this epoch was the reverse of secure. His reputation among the tribes had suffered from the unsuccessful operations against Ibn Rashid, during which he had incurred much loss in material and equipments, and during the greater part of 1915 he was engaged with a dangerous rising in the Hasa on the part of the ’Ajman.?' He himself believed that the revolt was instigated by the Turks and Ibn Rashid, hut it is doubtful whether his view was correct. Mubarak of Kuwait was convinced that there was no evidence to support it, but Mubarak, during the last few years of his reign, was not a lenient critic of Ibn Sa’ud’s difficulties. 10. His opinion is so far borne out that the troubles with the ’Ajman seem to have begun with the occupation of the Hasa by the Amir in 1913. Up to that time the tribe had been on good terms with him and had generally recognised him as suzerain, but the extension of his direct authority to . the Hasa, which is their headquarters, had strained their allegiance. He attempted to impose a poll tax upon them and stopped them from taking dues from caravans passing through the country, a toll which they had been accustomed to exact in the days of the Turks. The discontent of the ’Ajman was fanned by members of Ibn Sa’ud’s family who had long been at enmity with him—the ’Araif, grandsons of his uncle Sa’ud. Two of the ’Araif cousins, Fahad Ibn Sa’ud and Salman Ibn Muhammad, had taken refuge with the Shaikh of Bahrein. The Shaikh made a half-hearted attempt to. patch up a reconciliation in 1914, but the ’Araif refused his mediation and sought the protection of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, from whom they received some countenance when hostilities were renewed with Ibn Sa’ud in 1915. The rebellion now assumed serious proportions. Ibn Sa’ud sent for more troops from Riyadh and asked help from Kuwait, but before the arrival of either reinforcement he attacked the ’Ajman by night near Hofuf and met with a reverse, due partly to the cowardice of the Hofuf town levies. His brother Sa’ud was killed and he himself wounded. For a time his fortunes were at a very low ebb. He was in want of money and arms, and for all practical purposes was besieged in Hofuf. Ibn Rashid, oblivious of the agreement recently signed, seized the opportunity to raid the Qasim, but his advance was easily stopped, and the arrival of a force from Kuwait under the Shaikh’s son, Salim, turned the balance in the Hasa. The ’Ajman were routed in September, harried on their retreat northwards by the Bani Khalid, and forced to take refuge in Kuwait territory, where they remained until Shaikh Mubarak’s death in December. Fahad Ibn Sa’ud was killed in the retreat: Salman made his peace with Ibn Sa’ud at the end of the year. During the struggle we had facilitated the despatch of ammunition to Ibn Sa’ud from Bahrein, and done what we could to restrain Abn Dhabi. In October we presented ibn Sa’ud with' 1,000 rifles, and gave him a loan of 20,000b The Turks had not yet abandoned all hope of winning him over, and in July, previous to Ibn Rashid’s raid, a Turkish emissary, Salih al Sharif al Hasni, communicated with him and proposed a meeting ; but his request was refused, and on 26th December Ibn Sa’ud met Sir Percy Cox at Qatif, and the long-delayed treaty was completed and signed. Subject to certain safeguards, it provided Ibn Sa’ud with a dynastic guarantee in the dominions 'now in his possession, and promised him the support of Great Britain in case of unprovoked aggression from foreign Powers. On his side, Ibn Sa’ud engaged to hold no correspondence with any foreign Power, and to^rant no concessions to foreigners ; to keep open the roads to the Holy Places, and to commit no aggressive act on other Shaikhs under our protection. 11. Ibn Sa’ud was unaware of the exceedingly confidential correspondence which we had been carrying on with the Sharif during the winter of 1915-16, but the results to which it led could not leave him indifferent. Relations between the Hijaz and Najd had been dictated by conflicting sentiments. The Sharif had even more reason than Ibn Sa’ud to fear the Turks, but he was jealous- of Ibn Sa’ud’s position as an Arab Chief, and the feeling was reciprocated in Riyadh. The fluctuating allegiance of the tribes is a rich source of discord in Arabia, and the absence of any defined frontiers enhances the uncertainty of claims and obligations. In 1910 the Sharif ’Abdullah, asserting that he acted on behalf of the Ottoman Government, marched to the borders of the Qasim for the purpose of reasserting an authority which was probably a thing of the past and must at the best have been shadowy. The tangible results of the raid do not seem to have been SI 15 !6 more than a re-insistence on the Sharif’s suzerainty over the distant sections of the ’Ataibah, a tribe which had once been under Ibn Sa’nd, but had largely seceded to the Sharif. A small tribute to Mecca from the Qasim villages was stipulated for by Abdullah before his withdrawal, but it is unlikely that it was ever paid. From 1913 the Sharif showed strong anti-Turkish pro clivities, and before the outbreak of war he and Ibn Sa’ud drew together. They were in correspondence when Captain Shakespear paid his first visit to Riyadh in the spring of 1914-. In January 1915 they were acting in concert, and Ibn Sa’ud told Captain Shakespear that in his view the Ivhalifate would revert to the family of the Prophet, of which the Sharif was the representa tive, if it dropped from the hand of the Sultan of Turkey. In November 1915 ’Abdullah reappeared in Najd, with what object is not very clear. His own explanation was that he was sent on a mission to Ibn Sa’ud, with the further purpose of collecting dues in the Qasim and Sudair. Except for a doubtful suzerainty over wandering sections of the ’Ataibah, the Sharif does not seem in Beduin estimation to have rights in either province, his limits eastwards being somewhere between Long. 44° and Long. 45°, at Sha’arah, Duwadmi, Jabal Hlrarai and Jabal alNir. ’Abdullah is not reported to have advanced much beyond Sha’arah; he collected dues from the ’Ataibah, subdued the small allied section of the Buraih (by origin Mutair) and returned to the Hijaz ; but Ibn Sa’ud, barely emerged from a perilous contest in the Hasa, not unreasonably regarded the expedition as inopportune and even suspicious. (These sentiments were reflected in his conversations with Sir Percy Cox in December. He reminded the Chief Political Officer that the Wahabis recognised no Khalif after the first four, and was careful to add that if the Sharif should assume the title it would make no difference to his status among other ruling Chiefs.) In June of the following year the Sharif rose in open rebellion against the Turks and declared the independence of the Arabs. Ibn Sa’ud, writing in July to the Chief Political Officer, acknowledged the receipt from him of official news with regard to the Hijaz, expressed his satisfaction at the discomfiture of the Turks, but put forward his own apprehensions that the Sharif might proceed to claim authority over parts of'Najd, and in support of this fear observed that in declaring the independence of “the Arabs.” the Sharif appeared to treat them as a compendious whole, an attitude which he regarded with anxiety. 12. In August he wrote again, saying that he had now received a letter from the Sharif in which the latter announced the occupation of Mecca and asked him for his help. Ibn Sa’ud gave a summary of his reply, and a, copy of the original letter has since been received. He assured the Sharif that he would render all assistance which was in his power, but asked for a written under taking that the Sharif would abstain from trespassing in his territory or interfering with his subjects. Ibn Sa’ud went on to ask Sir Percy Cox whether his relations with the Sharif might be regarded as a matter which affected the two chiefs alone, or whether they touched on our interests, in which case he would be guided by our wishes. According to Arab reports received at Kuwait the Sharif wrote three times to Ibn Sa’ud asking for aid, and on two occasions sent him 2,0.00k Not improbably there is some truth in the rumoured remittance of small sums. 13. The Sharif’s answer, dated 5th September, to Ibn Sa’ud’s letter was, to say the least of it, unconciliatory, and aroused Lis lively indignation. His letter and the draft undertaking which had been sent with it for the Sharif’s acceptance were sent back with the observation that Ibn Sa’ud’s request could emanate only from a man bereft of reason. About the same time Ibn Sa ud received a letter from Ali Haidar acquainting him with his appointment as Sharif in place of Husain by the Ottoman Government, and calling on him to join the Jihad ; but in his reply Ibn Sa’ud expressed the resentment felt by the Arabs towards him and towards the Turks. 14. The Chief Political Officer dealt at length with the Hijaz question in a letter to Ibn Sa’ud dated 19th October. He ^pointed out how important it was to the Arab cause, which it was the policy of the British Government to support, that all the great Arab Chiefs should work together and in O'&amp; co-operation witli us in the common task of expelling the Turks from Arabia. As to Ibn Sa’ud’s own position, he need have no misgivings, for he had been acknowledged by us to be an independent ruler, and the Sharif must recognise the full import of the treaty. The British'Government had no reason to believe that he entertained any hostile intentions against the tribes and territories of Najd. 15. In the negotiation over the treaty in December 1915, Sir Percy Cox had discussed with Ibn Sa’ud the possibility of his giving us assistance against Ibn Rashid. The Hakim of Najd.then thought that Ibn Rashid would either come in or maintain a strict neutrality ; if, however, he showed himself actively hostile, Ibn Sa’ud would attack him and incite the northern ’Anazah against him. This intention, however, he failed to carry out. During the spring arid summer of 1916 he was occupied with a rebellion of the Murrah, following on, and perhaps connected with, that of the ’Ajman, which endangered his communications with the llasa. Though a large proportion of the lighting men of the Shammar had gone north with Ibn Rashid against the ’Iraq, no effective attack was made on Hail in their absence. In late June or early July, Ibn Sa’ud’s son, Turki, raided Jabal Shammar, and the news may have hastened Ibn Rashid’s retreat from our frontiers. In September or October Turki renewed hostilities against some of the Shammar Shaikhs and an allied section of the Harb, but the affair resulted only in the capture of a small amount of booty, and Ibn Sa’ud’s doctor, passing through Bahrein, brought a message to the effect that the Amir could do nothing against the Shammar as long as the fugitive ’Ajman remained on his flank. The true reason for his inactivity was no doubt his own insecurity at home, but the implacable hostility which he entertained toward the ’Ajman, whom he regarded not only as rebels, but as the murderers of his brother Sa’ud, threatened to become a problem of some difficulty. 16. When Shaikh Mubarak died in December 1915, Ibn Sa’ud pressed his son and successor in Kuwait, Jabir, to drive out the ’Ajman Shaikhs. Jabir made a temperate reply. He was unwilling to eject the ’Ajman, fearing that they would be thrown into the enemy camp ; but he could not hold out against Ibn Sa’ud’s insistence without creating an open breach, and he expelled the tribe in February 1916. As he anticipated, they turned for protection first to ’Ajaimi and then to Ibn Rashid, but in May they asked and obtained permission from the Shaikh of Zubair to settle quietly near Safwan, and subsequently several of the leading Shaikhs made submission to us. When Ibn Rashid returned to Hail only two of the ’Ajman Shaikhs remained with ’Ajaimi and they had little or no following. Ibn Sa’ud’s ardent desire to direct his energies upon the extermination of this tribe was not one with which we had any sympathy, at all events at the present juncture. 17. Shaikh Jabir, new to his office, could not hope to exercise the influence over Ibn Sa’ud which had been possessed by that practised and weighty diplomatist, his father ; moreover, for some years before Mubarak’s death, relations between Riyadh and Kuwait had been growing cooler. Ibn Sa’ud bitterly resented Mubarak’s attitude during the negotiations between himself and the Ottoman Government in the spring of 1914. According to his account, the Shaikh had at first counselled him to accept the Turkish offers ; but when he reached Kuwait in April, Mubarak changed his note without explanation and advised Ibn Sa’ud not to come to terms with the Turks, refusing at the same time to be present at his meeting with the delegates. So indignant was the Amir that he expressly stipulated with Captain Shakespear that Mubarak should not be consulted in the negotiations with ourselves. The asylum given to the ’Ajman was another grievance, and in 1916 Ibn Sa’ud complained of the incidence of the transit dues which had been, from time immemorial, levied in Kuwait. 18. While Ibn Sa’ud’s anxiety as to the ambitions of the Sharif and his growing estrangement with Kuwait showed that the chiefs allied with ourselves had not reached a satisfactory understanding with each other,there was evidence that the lurks were still active in Arabia. News was received from Ibn Sa’ud and from other sources of the despatch of an agent (Muhammad Taufiq ibn Fara’un of Damascus) for the purpose of buying camels for the Ottoman Government; the emissary was well chosen, for he was a personal friend of Ibn Sa’ud and had visited Najd on the same business the previous year. But on this occasion the Amir was pressed by us to prevent him from obtaining camels ; he accordingly arrested Ibn Fara’un, confiscated 700 camels which had been purchased in the interior, and sent them to Kuwait. Various reports, some of which came from Ibn Sa’ud, indicated that another attempt to stir up Ibn Rashid against us was in the wind. Rushaid Ibn Lailah, Ibn Rashid’s representative at Con stantinople, joined him at Hail, with a few German and Turkish officers, a small body of Turkish soldiers, and some guns ; accounts varied as to the exact composition of the mission, but its presence in Hail in some form seemed fairly certain. Ibn Sa’ud had written in September that he would be glad of a personal interview with the Chief Political Officer to discuss the question of co-operation with the Sharif or offensive action against Ibn Rashid. In October he repeated the request urgently, and on all grounds it seemed advisable to accede to it. Sir Percy Cox met him at Ojair on 11 th November. Ibn Sa’ud explained to him his position in detail. He had lost considerably in men and material in the fight with Ibn Rashid in January 1915. Since then he had been almost continuously in the field, first against the ’Ajman, and then against the Murrah. Most of the normal trade of Najd was with Syria, and the tribes were accustomed to sell their camels to Damascene dealers ; the strict blockade imposed by Ibn Sa’ud—the seizure of Ibn Fara’un’s camels bore witness to its reality—grew more and more galling; the Najdis grumbled, the tribes were restless, ail asked wherein lay the advantage to themselves of their Chief’s attitude, and it was increasingly difficult for him to keep them in hand. With regard to the Sharif, Sir Percy Cox was able to give Ibn Sa’ud the fullest reassurance. Our treaty with the Amir had been communicated to Mecca, and when the Sharif announced to us his intention of proclaiming himself King of the Arabs on 5th November, we had insisted on a formal admission that he claimed no jurisdiction over independent rulers. The news of the coronation at Mecca had not yet reached Central Arabia, and was not discussed. During conversation with the Chief Political Officer at Basrah, Ibn Sa’ud made a passing remark about the Sharif’s calling himself “ Sultan,” but his mind seemed to be set completely at rest on hearing that his rights were safeguarded by us, and* that the Sharif had explicitly denied any design on the independence of himself or his com peers. 19. Ibn Sa’ud having expressed to the Chief Political Officer at their meet ing at Ojair his inclination to pay a brief visit to Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait before returning home, the project was cordially encouraged as appearing eminentlv expedient, and Sir Percy Cox recommended that he should be presented with the K.C.I.E. at a Majlis which was to be held at Kuwait where the Shaikh was to be invested with the C.S.I. When he intimated to Ibn Sa’ud that this honour was to be accorded to him, the Chief Political Officer was authoiised to inform at the same time that his rights had been carefully reseived m all dealings which the British Government had held with the Sharif, and Ibn Sa’ud in his reply said that he was entirely satisfied on this point. 20. The Majlis took place on 20th November. The Shaikh of Muhammarah had come to Kuwait for the occasion, and many Beduin were present including the friendly headmen of the Shammar Aslam and Dhafir and Shaikhs of the Mutair. The Chief Political Officer, in presenting the decorations, a luded to our satisfaction in feeling that the great Arab chiefs were bent with us upon a common purpose.. The Shaikh of Muhammarah followed him with words which were warmly pro-British, and Ibn Sa’ud struck the keynote of the meeting m a speech which was as spontaneous as it was unexpected. He said that the Turks had placed themselves outsideV*“ Vi 'the pale of Islam by the iniquities which they had committed on other Moslems. He contrasted their policy with that of Great Britain, pointing out that the Turks had sought to weaken the Arabs by fomenting their differences, whereas the British Government encouraged them to unite in their own interest. He praised the action of the Sharif, and urged the obligation of all true Arabs to co-operate with him in forwarding the Arab cause. When he had brought his speech to an eloquent close, the three chiefs, Kuwait, Muhammarah, and Ibn Sa’ud, swore together that they would work with us for the achievement of a common end. 21. This scene made a deep impression on the local notables and on the Beduin Shaikhs present, who will, no doubt, carry the tale far and a vide. During the receptions at Kuwait, Ibn Sa’ud showed in all his utterances how clearly he had grasped the principle which guides our relations with Arabia. He quoted as air example of our benevolent policy towards the Arab cause the fact that we were ready even to promote a reconciliation between himself and Ibn Rashid if the latter would abandon his attitude of hostility. The arrival of Ibn Fara’ud’s 700 line camels, each branded with the wasm of that well-known dealer, gave a dramatic completeness to the Kuwait gathering. 22. From Kuwait Ibn Sa’ud went to Muhammarah as the guest of Shaikh Khaz’al, who co-operated most heartily in the endeavour to make Ibn Sa’ud’s visit profitable to him. The two chiefs arrived at Basrah on the evening of 26th November. Early next morning the Chief Political Officer, accom panied by the two chief military representatives of the Army Commander present in Basrah, went on board the Shaikh’s launch and presented Ibn Sa’ud with a sword of honour and a message of welcome from the Army Commander. The day was spent in exhibiting to him the base camps and organisation and the latest machinery of warfare, including the aircraft, in which he took an eager interest. Dhari ibn Twalah and Humud al Suwait, Shaikhs of the Shammar A slam and the Dhalir, were present, while Shaikh Ibrahim of Zubair and several Sunni notables of Basrah and refugees from Baghdad had an audience with Ibn Sa’ud on the launch. 23. The Kuwait Durbar and Ibn Sa’ud’s visit to Basrah have placed us in a singularly strong position. Three powerful chiefs have made public protes tation of their friendship with each other and their confidence in the British Government. A telegram received from the Sharif, congratulating them upon their zeal in the Arab cause and regretting that he had not had time to send a representative to Kuwait, confirmed the identity of his aims with their own, and in a further message he apologised for any deficiencies in his previous letters, on the ground that while he was in the throes of war he -might unintentionally fall short as a correspondent. The dream of Arab unity which engaged the imagination of the Liberals of Damascus during the year before the war has been brought nearer fulfilment than dreams are wont to come, but the role of presiding genius has been recast. Instead of the brilliant, unscrupulous Saiyid Talib, gyrating in the blast of his own ambition, the Chiefs of Eastern and Western Arabia have united at the instance of the British Government. 24. Besides this knitting together of Arab leaders, the meeting at Kuwait has produced certain immediate results. In the first place the extent and nature of Ibn Sa’ud’s share in future hostilities with Ibn Rashid, if such should occur, were agreed upon. He undertook to maintain 4,000 men under arms ; if Ibn Rashid moved in force towards the ’Iraq, he would move up parallel with him towards Zubair and join the friendly tribes and a contingent from Kuwait. He informed the friendly Shaikhs that he would support them if Ibn Rashid threatened to attack them in strength. If, however, Ibn Rashid should remain at Hail, Ibn Sa’ud would harass and attack him as opportunity offered, using the Qasim as a-base. In view of the strain upon his resources during the last two years, he has been given 3,000 rifles with ammunition, as well as four machine-guns, and granted a monthly subsidy of 5,000b to cover the expenses he will incur in maintainingMb n, n in the hehh ^ -e Mecca ae a sign of goodwill, if the Sharif would make a special request for them. pr Secondly a letter was written by Ibn Sa’ud, in the name of the three . -?■ cecon ) ’ ,, nro .; 11 „ UT) on him the harm which he was ^n^’to* the Arab'cause hv his present attitude, inviting him to enter into communication with them and promising him friendly consideration and an opportunity for honourable submission. 20 Finally, with the co-operation of Shaikh Jabir of Kuwait and the dinlomatic skill of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, who was throughout of the h fhe“t seryice to the Chief Political Officer, the delicate problem raised by the presence of the ’Ajman among the friendly tribes reached a satislactoiy solution For the period of the war a truce between Ibn Sa ml and the 'bman was agreed upon and instructions were drafted defining the position of the fugitive Shaikhs with respect to all tribes under our protection On his return to Basrah Sir Percy Cox called in the Ajman leaders. Ihey had been profoundly disquieted by'the advent of IbirSa’ud, thinking that it augured i ^ for themselves, but the principal and more courageous headmen met the Chief Political Officer at Zubair and accepted the proposed terms, m letum for which they were promised a monthly allowance similar to that received by the other friendly P Shaikhs of the Shamiyah They evinced little doub that the remaining headmen of the ’Ajman including the two who were still with ’Ajaimi, would come in as soon as they heard of the happy issue of their own venture. 27. Letters have been written to Fahad Beg Ibn Ifadhdhal infornhng him of the Kuwait meeting and inviting him to join the league of Aral) Cine s m expellino- the Turks. These have been sent through a man from. Fahad Item’s tents who was in Basrah at the time of Ibn gaud’s visit and went to see him at Muhammarah, where he received advice and instructions Lorn Shaikh Khaz’al in full measure. He was entrusted also with letters from the Sharif which have been waiting opportunity of despatch to k abaci Beg, Hachim al Muhaid, ’All Sulaiman of the Dulaim and others, and with presents in money to guide Fahad Beg’s decision and to encourage the amicable disposition of the Shaikh of the Dahamshah, Jaza ibn Mijlad Communications of the same nature are on their way to Atiyah al Qnlal of Hajaf and Muhammad ’Ali Kamunah of Karbala.

After being there a long time he appears to have got Shereef Haidar to allow him to leave on condition that he wouJd deliver certain letters at Hail. Saiyid Mahomet agreed, but on leaving Medina avoided Hail and reached Qasim where Lliii baud s deputy detained him pending orders from his master. ! bn baud^ sends me m original the three letters for Hail that Saiyid was carrying and also a letter from Saiyid to himself. The former were addressed respectively to Ibn Rashid, Ibn LaiJa and one Saiyid /aid Beg, apparently an agent of Shereef Haidar with Ibn Rashid ihehrst two letters merely asked recipients to assist Saiyid in his journey, ihe third letter which was evidently the important one, directed addressee chat if he considered Ibn Rashid was likely to delay much longer in making a _ move towards-Medina he was to come away without him, but without giving m ence. Ihe Saiyid s letter to Ibn Saud explains circumstances of his departure from Medina. He then writes that Turks now realise Ibn bauds importance, and greatly regret having alienated him. They attribute Shereef s defection to that fact and find that Ibn Rashid is a broken reed and of no use to them. They would now “ give Ibn Saud half they possessed ” to win him back. He has only to say what he wants and he will get it at once. Writer, however, reminds Ibn Sand hem Turks have deceived the Arabs^ generally, ami hints that Ibn Sand will not be [Awm groups uiKkedphoiable]. In conclusion he repeats desire for personal meeting as he has matters to explain. The foregoing seem to suggest that Saiyid had a mission to Ibn Saud. If so he may be connected with a mission recently reported to have been sent from Medina with object of protesting to Ibn baud against seizure of Ibn Faroon’s camels. There is, however, nothing specifically stated in letters on this point. v /9 ‘ [Su) If 6 ) ^ 7 Cma e^cctfptFrom Political Resident, Basra, 12th January 1917.

Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith an interest ing Sketch of A bdul Aziz Ibn Saud from the pen of Miss Gertrude Bell. Ordinarily it would go forward in Bureau or - -- publicity series, but as I am not sure v/hether it will be considered expedient at this juncture to refer in any - - published article to our hitherto '’Secret' 1 Treaty with Tbn Saud, and to other incidents of our relations with him, it seems advisable in order to preclude the possibility of publication by oversight, to submit it officially for dis posal as higher authority may consider expedient. c I am however sending a copy of the article and of this covering letter separately to the usual recipients of the Bureau issues of this Office. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, . zAr Chief Political Officer,Basra. To The Political Secretary to the Government of India, India Office, LondonThe visit to Basrah on November 27th of Ibn Sa’ud was an episode in the Mesopotamian campaign no less pic turesque to the onlookers than it was significant to those who have studied the course of Arabian politics. Bor the past century the history of the interior of the % peninsula has centred round the rivalry between the Amirs of Northern and Southern Hajd, Ibn Rashid and Ibn Sa’ud. Yi/hen 1 Abdul VAziz, the present representative of the house of Sa’ud, was a boy of 15 the power of the Rashid touched its zenith; the great Amir Muhammad, Doughty’s grudging host, drove the Sa’ud into exile and occupied their capital, Riyadh. For 11 years 'Abdul 'Aziz eat .w: the bread of adversity, but in 1902 the fhaikh of Kuwait, on the Persian Gulf, himself at enmity wth the Rashid, saw in the young Amir a promising weapon and gave him his chance. With a force of some eighty oamel riders supplied by Kuwait, 'Abdul 'Aziz swooped down upon Riyadh, surprised Ibn Rashid's garrison, slew his representative and pro claimed his own accession from the recaptured city. The story of his bold adventure is part of the stock m traae of Beduin reminiscence - the arrival of the tiny band at dusk in the palm gardens south of the town, the halt till nightfall, the scaling of the palace wall by 'Abdul 'Aziz and eight picked followers, the flash of steel which roused and silenced the sleeping foe and at dawn the P * throwing open of the city gates to the comrades of the victor. The struggle was not over with the sdarocxi.® capture of Riyadfe. In a contest renewed year after year 'Abdul 'Aziz recovered the territories of his father and made for himself a name which filled the echoing deserts. At length in 1913 his restless energy brought him into fields of wider political importance. He seized the Turkish province of Hasa, formerly an appanage of Riyadh, ejected the Ottoman garrisons and established hims elfalXAs4y on terms of personal friendship with Captain ear,our Political Agent at Fuwait, and IVothing was more certain than that his appearance on the coast must ultimately bring him into direct contact with Great Britain, but before the difficult question of his precise relationship to Constantinople had been adjusted, the outbreak of war with Turkey released us from all obliga tion to preserve a neutral attitude. In the winter of ary in an indecisive engagement in which Captain Shakes- pear, though he was present as a non-combatant, was wounded and killed. We lost in him a gallant officer wheee knowledge of Central Arabia and rare skill in handling y$he tribesmen marked him out for a useful and distin guished career. His deeds lived after him. Less than a year later Ibn Sa ! ud met Sir Percy Cox, Chief Political Officer of the Occupied Territories, and Chief Political Agent of the Gulf and concluded a formal agreement with Great Britain. His close connection with us has received public confirmation in a durbar of Arab Shaikhs held at Kuwait on IT 0 vember, -bGth, where he was invested with the K,C.I.E. On that memorable occasion three powerful Arab chiefs, the Shaikh of Muhammarah, who though a Persian subject is of Arab stock, the Shaikh of Kuwait and Ibn Sa f ud Hakim of Naj/d, stood side by side in amity and concord and proclaimed their adherence to the British cause. In a speech as spontane/ous as it was unexpected, Ibn Sa’ud pointed out that whereas the Ottoman Government had sought to dismember and weaken the Arab nation, British policy aimed at uniting and strengthening their leaders, and the Chief Political Officer as he listened to words which will be repeated and discussed round Exrjqs: every 1914-15 Captain Shakespear^ 'made his way - for the .second time ■&lt; into Najd and joined Ibn Sa^d who was marching norhh to repel attack JEbn Rashid / engineered and backed .nd backed by the Turks, The two forces met towards the end of Janujf-camp fire, must have looked hack on years of patient work ‘ in the Gulf and seen that they were good. Ibn Sa ! ud is now barely forty, though he looks some years older. He is a man of splendid physique, standing aw well over six feet,^carrying himself with the air of one ve accustomed to command.Though he is more massi^ly built than the typical nomac|bhaikh, he has the characteristics of the well-bred Arab, the strongly|marked aqutiiiline profile, full-fleshed nestrils, prominent lips and long narrow chin accentuated by a pointed beard. His hands are fine^ith slender fingers, a trait almost universal among the tribes of pure Arab blood, and in spite of his great height and breadth of shoulder he coveys the impression, common enough in the desert, of an indefinable lassitude, not individual but racial, the secular weariness of an ancient and self-contained people, which has made heavy draughts on its vital forces and borrowed little from beyond its own forbidding frontiers. His deliberate move ments, his slow sweet smile and the contemplative glance of his heavy-lidded eyes,though they add to his dignity and charm, do not accord with the Western conception of a vigoi|irous personality, nevertheless report credits him with powers of physical endurance rare even in hard-bitten Arabia. Among men bred in the camel saddle he is said to have few rivals as a tireless rider. As a leader of - - irregular forces he is of proved daring and he combines with his qualities as a soldier that grasp of statecraft which is yet more highly prized by the tribesmen. To be M a statesman” is perhaps their final word of commendation. Politician, ruler and raider, Ibn Sa*ud illustrates a historic type. Such men as he are the exception in any community, but they are thrown up persistently by the Arab race in its own sphere, and in that sphere they meet its needs. They furnished the conquerors and military adminis trators of the Mohammadan invasion, who were successful justjust where Ion Sa’ud, if he had lived in a more primitive age, might have succeeded, and. failed 7 just as in a smaller field he may fail 7 in the task of creating out of a society essentially tribal a united and homogeneous state of a durable nature. Muhammad al Rashid was the classic example in the generation before our own - he has been dead twenty years but his fame survives. Like him 'Abdul 'Aziz has drawn the loose mesh of tribal organization into a centra lized administration and imposed on wandering confederacies an authority which^though fluctuating is recognized as a political factor. The Sa'ud have in the palm groves of Riyadh and the oases of their northern and eastern provinces Q,asim and Hasa, wider resources, greater wealth and a larger settled population than the Rashid, and their dominion rests therefore on a more solid foundation, but the ultimate source of power, here as in the whole course of Arab his tory, is the personality of the commander. Through him, whether he be an 'Abbadid Khalif or an Amir of Najd, the political entity holds, and with his disappearance it breaks. If the salient feature of the Kuwait darbar w r as the recognition by the assembled Arab chiefs of the good will of Great Britain towards their race, it was the presence of an unchanging type of desert sovereignty, among conditions so modern that they had scarcely grown familiar to those who created them, which gave Ibn Sa'ud$ visit to Basrah its distinctive colour. In the course of a few hours the latest machinery of offence and defence was paraded before him. He watched the firing of high explosives at an - - improvised trench and the bufcsting of anti-air craft shells in the clear heaven above. He travelled by a railway not six months old ; and sped across the desert in a motor car to the battle field of Sha'aibafe, where he inspected British infantry and Indian cavalry, and witnessed a battery of artillery come into action. In one of the base hospitals, housed in a palace of our good friend the Shaikh of Muham-marah, xx he was shown thebaDOxos of his own hand under the w Rontgen ray. He walked along the great wharfs on the Shatt al Arab, through the heaped stores from which an army is clothed and fed, and saw an aeroplane climb up the empty sky. He looked at all these things with wonder, but the interest which he displayed in the mechanism of warfare was that of a man who seeks to learn, not of one who stands confused, and unconsciously he justified to the officers who were his hosts the reputation he has gained in Arabia for sound sense and distinguished bearing. 'It is good for us' said the Shaikh of Muhammarah, as the two chiefs took their leave, ' to see your might,' Those who heard him may well have found their thoughts reverting to a might greater and more constant than that of the War Lord, and looked forward to the day when we f&gt; shall expound the science of peace instead of the science of destructionCOPY OF TELEGRAM.

It ha« already teen reported that owing to scarcity and oppression from which they hare suffered in Syria, a large concourse of Bedouins of the Amarat, Fidaan and Sba divisions of the Anazah have migrated to our side of desert all asserting that they have finished with Turks and are anxious to serve us under the tanner of Fahad Beg Ibn Hadhdhal. Good rain has at length failed in the desert, and when their animals have had two or three weeks grazing, intention is to celebrate this unusual gathering of Anazah by a combined move southward in force against their hereditary enemies the Shammar, incidentally shifting Ajaimi en route* It is believed that they can muster 3000 mounted men and Leachman who is Political Bffieer . ,4 , . . ' - • r- * r with Fahad Beg and his tribes has great expectations of move ment. Thus with Itn Saud moving at the same time from Qasim we shall have a great Anazah combination before which Hail must almost certainly fall and Ibn Pashid be eliminated. ( one corrupt group) such an event would have tremendous effect both gmnn g the Bedouins of the desert and tribes as it would sweep away last stronghold of Turkish influence (and) intrigue in Central Arabia. It would at the same time make our position on Lower Euphrates valley line much more satisfactory. The initiative in regard to proposal for attacking Hail has come from Egypt andfrom H.M.Govemment (e.g. Secretary of State’s telegram of 24th March 1917 and Sykes's telegram *£ No 25 of 10th May.). I assume therefore that it is common ground that the accomplishment of project is in interests of our war aims: while from tribal point of view there can be no doubt that present moment is ideal opportunity for action. Should the movement terminate by the capture of Hail oy Ibn baud he2. h* would I fancy install one of members of Ibn Rasbid family who hare beencrefugees with him for some years past remaining with him until he had gained adherence of the Shaasar and then, 11 him a# his daputy« As regards relations between Sheriff and Ibn Saud the personal impression which I hare derived of the Sheriff’s attitude is that realising that he will never again after the war be in such a strong position as he is now either tribally or financially Sheriff is bent on doing his utmost to weaken his rival both by discrediting Ibn Saud in our eyes and by achieving during the war such a prominent position for himself as Ibn Saud will never be able to challenge. As regards Ibn Saud on the other hand, it is clear from Philby’e reports not only that he will never accept a position of vassalage to the Sheriff but that he aspires to a status in Nejd not inferior to that of King Husain in Hejaz. In any case we may be sure that any permanent understanding or peace between the two is out of the question and indeed looking to the readjustment of Arabian principalities which must follow on the conclusion of peace it seems to me that there will be great advantage in our having a potentate in Nejd who would form an adequate counterpoise to the Sheriff'in the Hejaz. Such an arrangement will certainly tend greatly to simplify our work in Iraq and will automatically correct any inconvenient Z-LZ .hie, our ™r policy .»is* » * * the Sheriff. I fully however that we cannot give Ibn Saud any fresh status or assurances just now.nor even if he captures Hail, such as would excite Sheriff, suspicion or active opposition; we can only assure former that our treaty . with him stands good, that we have every intention of safe guarding the independent status which we have guaranteed him and that he must rest content with that for the present. As regards question of coinage,if Ibn Saud presses for i we might get round difficulty by using son* innocuous legenc^ on the coins such as 'Hukun.t N.jd’ and by protracting executionof work until end of war. Have not yet discussed project with G.O.C.in C. whose *iews please await.

(Addressed to Foreign and repeated to Secretary of State for India and High Commissioner, Cairo.) (Received 21st December, 5 p.m.) 6184. In continuation of my telegram, 6070, of 15th December. The mam topjcs on which Bin Sand wished to unburden himself were as follows (1) Relations of ourselves and the Sheikh of Koweit and the Annan tribe. (2) The respective rights of himself and Sheikh of Koweit to levy tribute from Awazim tribe. This question hinges upon Ajman problem with whom the Awazim are connected, r/c/c third paragraph of Article at page 190 of Persianj^Gazetteer. (3) Question of illicit trading to enemy, whether from Koweit or from Qasim. As regards (1) the history of Bin Sand’s feud with Ajman will be found in my Arab Bureau Nos. 18, of 25th July 1916, and 62, of 14th September 1916. Bin Sand resents their being allowed to reside or market from Koweit or occupied territory, and considers that in not obliging certain sections of them to remain in Koweit or British territory in accordance with undertaking given to us last year, we failed adequately to safeguard his interests. The fact is, without employment of troops, neither is the Sheikh of Koweit able effectively to deny them access to Koweit, nor are we able to control their movements. It was my hope and advice that Bin Sand would come to a temporary reconciliation with them in view of larger interests at stake, but owing to loss of his brother at their hands, his animosity towards them is implacable, and it appears from his conversations with Phil by that although he does not specifically admit it, his failure to make any big move against Bin Rashid has been partly due to fear that in his absence Ajman might threaten his rear, and even move against Hasa. This aspect of the matter, however, he has never hinted at hitherto, nor do I think apprehension was justified. Difficulty was provisionally settled with him on following lines :— Hamilton, on returning to Koweit, is to explain situation to Sheikh Salem, and through him call on Ajman to accept one of two alternatives—they must either join our friend^ Pad ad Beg/Ibn Hadhdhal, and remain neutral or act with him, or their leaders must go to Bin Sand and make submission and arrange to live where he directs in territory under his control. In the event of their not accepting either of above alternatives the tribes to be regarded as hostile and not allowed to enter Koweit or British territory. As regards Awazim it is arranged that Colonel Hamilton shall endeavour to induce Sheikh of Koweit to write friendly letter to Bin Saud deprecating continuance of friction in connection with this tribe, reaffirming brotherly affection and suggesting friendly reversion to old arrangement by which the Awazim paid taxes to Sheikh. If such letter is received Bin Saud agrees to accept solution without reserve. As regards problem of trade to enemy Bin Saud declines to accept any responsibility for leakage via Qasim until an adequate blockade is established, at Koweit on the ground that by so doing he only penalises his own subjects for the benefit of enemy traders in Koweit or elsewhere. A suitable form of permit and other restrictive arrangements have been devised with Bin Saud which should prove effective in conjunction with institution of adequate blockade at Koweit. Latter measure will be difficult without assistance of troops. As you are aware this question is under lively consideration but it cannot be settled pending Colonel Hamilton’s return to Koweit at the end of month. The above disposes of non-military problems discussed. The military situation and possibilities will be dealt with in separate telegram.— *** i J !i b rom Sir P. Cox, 20th December 1917. (Addressed to Foreign, repeated to High Commissioner, Cairo, and Secretary of State for India.) (Received 9 p.m., 21st.j m , ^185. In continuation of iny telegram 6184. As regards military possibilities, following is gist of Philby’s messages :— lie and W-a till ton agree that settlement of Ajman and Awazim questions with^Sheikh of Koweit is a sine qua non to any forward action on the part of Ibn Sand. (Such settlement, we hope, is assured on lines indicated in mv previous telegram.) Hitherto Ibn Saud has done no more than keep Ins son Turki controlling tribal situation in Qasim and acting as watching outpost, mainly on defensive, but attacking or seducing Ibn Rashid’s tribes as opportunity offered. Ibn Sand asks us to recognise, however, that by so doing he has at least rendered it impossible for Ibn Rashid to divert strength towards Mesopotamia. As regards armament, Ibn Saud estimates that Ibn Rashid has 20,000 good modern rifles and at least live mountain guns, and can muster 15,000 tribesmen ; whereas he himself has seven serviceable mountain guns, four machine guns, and about 8,000 rifles, of which probably 3,000 are needed for garrisons of Hasa and other Provinces. Philby considers this estimate of Ibn Rashid’s resources is doubtless overdrawn, but that it is certain that Ibn Rashid is stronger in regard to both number and quality of rifles, and he considers that force of 15,000 men is minimum required to tackle him effectively. Ibn baud states that given adequate assistance in money and arms, he could mobilise that number, and whereas immediate future is most favourable time lor action, lie could if necessary keep them mobilised until next June, when they would disperse on commencement of Ramazan. He would prefer not to mobilise in Qasim, but probably in Sidairfand watch for favourable opportunity to deliver sudden blow, lie confesses that Hail is difficult nut to crack owing to unity between townsmen and Beduin, but considers that once in Hail he could act effectively further afield with co-operation of his Anaizah connections. He gauges his requirements for success as follows, namely, 2 siege and 2 field guns with necessary ammunition; 10,000 rifles with ammunition; a, I ( l 00,0000 per month for period of operation; in addition he requires certain personnel, preferably Arab prisoners of war who served in Turkish Artillery. If Jlritish Artillery officer, is deputed he must know Arabic well and be prepared to live the life of Arabs. Cunliffe Owen’s estimate (which is being telegraphed separately) is not very different to above, and they agree that if it is mainly complied with project is worth, undertaking, and has good prospects of success. It is for higher authority to decide whether game is worth the candle, and he hopes that decision will be favourable. ? ^ proposes that guns be sent as asked for by Cunliffe Owen, together with 7,000 or 8,000 rifles, and that Ibn Saud be granted an initial sum of 20,000k for purchase of camels, &amp;c., and a monthly grant of 50,000k for three months, on condition of his main taining lo,000 men under arms in field, and promise of a present of 50,000k on capture of Hail, and continuance of monthly allowance if his services are required further. They would of course remain to see that object is (? attained) attempted. If proposals are to be accepted time is all important , and Rhilby trusts that every effort will be made to ensure arrival of arms, Ac., by middle or at least end of January, preferably via Bahrein. There can be no doubt that Ibn Saud can, if necessary, raise much larger force than that proposed, and. will exert himself to utmost, and, if object in view' is still considered important, he trusts that decision will not be delayed as time is short and mobilisation cannot start until decision is known. Cunliffe Owen’s appreciation to Chief of General Staff, Baghdad, follows. &lt;Fir\d! p j; X N CtL’VS- lr*~- Up tfsjL, Pi-xJryy. * 4\ 1 - • / J From Sir P. Cox, Baghdad, '20th December 1917.

Following from Com manding Officer :— ' ^ “5th December. At the request of OF I send following summary of possibilities of military action on the part of Fg as gathered from conversation with S. and observations to date:—‘At present no sign of any movement, but S. anxious to discuss measures and undertake movement if certain facilities granted. Difficult for me to judge relative prospects of success as between him and Ibn Rashid, but from statement put chances appear reason able, and, if successful against Hail, he might then move further and co-operate in general plan towards lledjaz rail. Time is somewhat essential . factor, and, if requirements are regarded favourable, they should be forth coming not later than end of January. R. said to have 2-0,000 rifles—an exaggeration, probably, but to be secure S. should be able to equip a force of 15,000. OHo do this he lacks 5,000 to 8,000 rifles, allowing for those supplied by British Government to date, and others already in possession, which, however, are of many patterns, while bulk of R.’s are Mausers.(DNext essential factor is small party to work Maxims and mountain guns already in possession. These have nqnv ke-f-v fired or practised in any way and only one man knows anything about them. There are eight serviceable mountain guns in all, but it is possible that attack ou Hail would require something larger.Provision of further artillery not such essential factors as to delay operations, but if available a mantelli converted territorial battery might eventually be necessary. “ ‘ Weight of these are not too heavy to carry across desert by slinging between camels. Personnel one officer and twelve other ranks would be necessary for them. In giving these requirements I am merely stating what would be requisite if policy is to push Bin Sand to military measures. Money grant being dealt with by P. Pattern of rifles preferred, therefore, magazine carbine or short rifles captured. Mausers would do. Personnel, named on account of locality, should preferably be Arabs selected from amongst prisoners of war. In any case small party for Maxims and mountain guns might be sent, as otherwise they are perfectly useless. I f S. had facilities stated^being favourably regarded, he might induce commencement of preparations pending arrival.

Cox, Baghdad, 21st December 1917. {Addressed to Foreign, repeated, to Secretary of State for India, and, High Commissioner, Cairo.) (Received 23rd, at 5 p.m.) (R.) 6230. In continviation of rny telegram No. 6186 have since received following further message from Philb y, dated 8th December, which I repeat in extenso :— ^ “ Before starting for Taiw I should like to add that as result of further- interviews that I am very confident something big can be achieved in desired direction on basis of proposals made, more especially as Bin Sand is in serious financial straits, and would certainly commence operations to ensure continuance of money grant proposed on condition of mobilisation. We could therefore keep him up to mark in that respect. Higher authority may, however, not think object in view worth outlay involved. 1 hope this is not the case, but if it is I think that the minor operations might be attempted by mobilisation on small scale in Qasim (? and harrying country) round Hail. If therefore my original (? proposals), or something near them are not accepted I would propose as an alternative that I be given discretion to make doles up to maximum of 50,0001. for minor objects actually achieved to my satisfaction. We might thus keep Sheikh Salem *on the move, and possibly cut off traffic from Medina, &amp;c., whence Hail gets supplies. Trust that bigger scheme will be accepted and early steps taken to supply requirements. “ Secondly .—Tbn Sand has of course thrown out hints regarding his future status though he has not yet made obvious (corrupt group). Offer of that might prove an attractive bait if made conditional on capture of Hail, and as demand is bound to come sooner or later I should like to know to what extent I can encourage, or should discourage hopes in that direction. Last night we came very near it (one corrupt group; question of copper coinage, but 1 rode him off,, and it is partly to be out of (one corrupt group) that I decided to go to Taisw before my return (corrupt group) your reply to my M. 10 should come.' “ Thirdly .—'Would it be possible to send couple of Lewis guns as present. He hinted that he would like them, and I should like to meet his wishes as he is doing us royally. “ Fourthly .—In the event of major proposals being accepted it would be convenient if 200 tents could be sent, but this is not essential. “ Trust early decision will be arrived at regarding possible action, as nothing further can be done till reply comes.” As regards coinage question, just before Mission left Mesopotamia, Ibn Sand had sent Basra Agent here to see me about two or three matters, one of which w r as great need in Nejd for copper coinage and his desire that w r e should mint some for him in Bombay. In replying on this point on 31st October, I merely said that Rhilby would discuss it with him. Probable motive of request was apparent, and I instructed Philby to endeavour to ride him off it on the ground that it was not a pressing matter, and that I felt sure that Government of India would be too busy to take it up until the end of war.

Phiiby writes:- n Ibn Saud displays consuming jealousy of Sheriff whose assumption in correspondence of title ’ King of Arab Countries ’ grills him to distraction while at the back of his mind is the suspicion that Sheriff’s attitude in this connection is based on some secret understanding with us.

On same date with reference to your 1198 of 12th Novr. he writes!- ' Itn Saud heartily welcomes proposed deputation of Storr as likely to give Egyptian authorities glimpse of other side of shield but he expresses the opinion that Sheriff desires to disclaim responsibility after Storr leaves Hedjaz frontier is merely a ruse to fca deter Egypt from pressing proposal.

Cunliffe Owen remains with Ibn Saud pending Philby’s, return. I very much hope that in the above circumstances you will yet find it possible to arrange for Storr’s journey either with or with out a representative from Sheriff as I am sure our common interests will be greatly promoted thereby. I am sure you will agree that Kxfisx His kajesty's attitude in re gird to this Nejd conference is most unfortunate and that we can but draw our own deductions therefrom. Should Philby reach Tajf perhaps you will consider expediency of his seeing Sheriff in the hope of being able to clear atmosphere in regard to Ibn Saud and perhaps induce Sheriff to send someone on his behalf back to Riyadh for a frank talk with Ibn Saud.

In view, however, of danger of leakage to the enemy, following instructions were telegraphed with the concurrence of Army Commander : “ The arrival of such a large caravan of Shammar without warning presents a very difficult problem, and though we accept definite assurance of lurki Bin Sand and Sheik Salim that caravan is from among those Shammar who have definitely become subjects of Bin Saud, and are living in his territory, yet unless adequate safeguards are imposed there still remains the danger that some of these supplies may be diverted to the enemy in spite of Turki’s efforts to the contrary. “It is absolutely necessary to prevent this and to give Sherif no cause for complaint on this score. “R has been accordingly decided to allow caravan to take rice and dates from Koweit on the following conditions : — “(1) That the caravan shall travel in one body and not in driblets, and shall be accompanied to the headquarters of Turki Bin Sand’by a British Officer on my behalf. (A) I hat two leading headmen of caravan, including one of two mentioned in your telegram, shall remain at Koweit as the guests of Sheikh Salim and ourselves until news is received from Turki and the British officer of their safe arrival with the whole caravan at their destination. Unless these conditions are accepted in writing by the heads of the caiavan endoised by Bin Sands agent at Koweit, Musabilah, [supplies ? (omitted)] will not be given. “ The British officer referred to will be Colonel HamiltoiC Political Agent, Koweit, who will reach Koweit in course of next few days. “ If above conditions are formally accepted purchase of goods may commence, but nothing is- to be removed or loaded pending Colonel Hamilton’s arrival.” ' (il ' ll | in 11111 Uliwl f — pjev mTi'jUCwl, p,. j From Sir P.

The latter left for TurAvo-. ’s camp with a Qasim caravan on the 8 th September, lie will report fully situation of Qasim, and it is hoped his presence will suffice to prevent leakage of supplies to enemy. “ Secondly, Ibn Saud in a letter dated 23rd September from Riyadh writes that Shammar tribesmen are all taking refuge with him with their families, and are giving assurance that they are now enemies of Ibn Rashid, and ask his good offices with us in order to obtain access to our markets. He observes that it seems to him to be our best policy to admit them to our favours and thus win them over completely, but he is anxious that we should deal with their Sheikhs direct so that he may not incur sole responsi bility for their good faith.

I should propose therefore as soon as I know its itinerary to inform Shereef of its advent and to suggest to him strong advisability of sending a responsible Ghereefian delegate, who cou-lI be accompanied by a British officer from here, to Ibn Saudis headquarters where they rculd co-operate with Mesopotamian Mission., The latter I suggested should tame with it a receiving wireless telegraphy set.

It was my hope that projected mission of Storrs in June last, and latter’s passage on ffee Sherif with Bin Sand’s envoy, would have effect both of dispelling atmosphere of distrust prevailing in Sherif’s circle, and of enabling us to decide if there were any' means by which we could make Bin Sand more actively useful. The project having unfortunately fallen through, it seemed imprudent to repeat experiment with another officer at that season ; but we are now reaching end of hot weather, and the present season is favourable for reviewing the position and reviving project if that course seems to be indicated. The appreciation of Bin Sand presented in Arab Bureau bulletin No. 53, hardly does adequate justice to him, even in some points of fact, but the later notes in bulletins Nos. SQ^and^bO, in a great measure removes unfavourable impression, and demonstrates that distrustful attitude of Sherif and his sons is uncalled for. Incidentally the divergence of the Sherif’s statements quoted on pages 333 and 346 respectively, on the subject of Sherif Abdulla’s doings in Nejd in 1914, shows Sherif’s own insincerity in that respect. In any case, visit of Bin Sand’s father to Mecca should promote better understanding. As regards information reported from Aden, it will be noted it was gathered second-hand from Turkish sources which^would naturally seek to convey most unfavourable impression as regards hbfTSaud. Moreover, I see from the original Aden report that passage of money referred to is said to have occurred “ before the outbreak of hostilities in the Heja$.” If that is the case, the report has no practical bearing on Bin Saud’s attitude since his public announcement of his adherence to us in November last. It is possible, however, that report may refer to mission reported in my telegram No. 766, dated [?] to Bureau address. Saiyid Muhammad Abdulla Yemani seems to have been one of this party. The report of arrival of this mission in Qasim reached Koweit by caravan in mid December, at which time Bin Sand was still influenced by return journey home via Bahrein, after his visit to Basra. His first act on reaching home was to send me original letters [referred to in my telegram] which he found awaiting him. On my writing to him to beware of Abdulla Yemani, he replied, proposing to send me a representative to give fuller information. It seems clear from comparison of dates that Abdulla Yemani and party never came in contact with Bin Saud himself, as they had passed through Qasim before the fatter reached Riadh. If as is quite possible a consignment of Turkish notes and some thousand liras got through, it must have been due to slackness or connivance of Bin Saud’s retainers in Qasim on whose complete loyalty he cannot depend. In above connection, it will be realised from what follows, that Bin Saud has a very difficult task in present conditions to keep his tribes together. Some weeks ago he sent in urgently to Bahrein asking us to send him out a doctor as there was a suspicious epidemic prevailing in Riyadh. No British doctor being available, American doctor Harrison, in whom I have confidence, having offered to go, I agreed to his doing so. He has now returned and following is summary of his news :— Bin Saud appeared quite satisfied with what we have done for him and had only praise for us, but he is greatly hampered and pre-occupied by the difficult task of making his tribes pull together, and he thinks we do not fully realise this. They resent prolonged stress of war and the severe restrictions placed upon their trade and consequently public feeling in Nejd is not really for us ; and though owing to loyal attitude of Bin^ Saud, there is no overt'talk against us, yet there is no word spoken in our favour, 'X-A V i£ lIncidentally our failure (for obvious reasons) since our occupation of Bagdad to open pilgrim routes and allow free trade, is not understood and has caused disappointment and adverse comment. Another difficult}’ for Bin Sand is that the money lavished on the tribes by the Sherif from our handsome subsidies has spoilt the market for Bin Baud who cannot compete and finds it difficult to keep his chiefs contented. Bin Sand’s potential value from military point of view has never been over-estimated here and he himself has always maintained that unless assisted with artillery and personnel he was not in a position to attempt to capture Hail. In January last I think we were all agreed it would have been mistaken policy to [group omitted?] any project beyond his powers in which he might have suffered disaster ; and though it is true we have presented him with three machine guns and two mountain guns yet we were unable to give him any personnel from here and without it they are of doubtful use. In short it is clear if we require to make more military use of him we must really approach subject seriously and lend him an Egyptian or Indian battery with £ 2 —-—Jto run it for him. I myself doubt whether game would be worth the candle, but Egypt may have other views. In any case, however, 1 think it would be for the common good if we were now to send a mission to him consisting of a Political officer from here and one from Egypt in whose opinion Sherif would have conlidence together with a military staff officer, preferably a gunner, who could see the country and make proposals in accordance with practical possibilities. Short of giving him such material assistance and personnel, we pnay depend on his loyally doing his best on the allowance that we make him to keep his tribes together and to harass and seduce Bin Rashid’s adherents as opportunity offers, but I do not think we can expect much more.

Following telegram since received from Political Agent, Bahrein :— “ Verbal message for you from Bin Sand has been given me by brother of his Agent here just returned from Riyadh. Sand says he is in difficulties as he has to pay his men five or six liras a month (Turki’s force alone costs him 10,000 a month) and he has to give large presents to Bedouin and others who visit him. His men are being attracted away by higher pay offered by Sherif, Latter collects revenue from Harb Ataibah from whom he used to collect it. He has taken no counter action only because of his friendship with us. Sherif is not in his heart friendly to him.

Since then you will have got a mes sage from me saying that I was anxious to send an Officer from this side, in order to discuss with you various affairs and to lot me know your views. I will now explain to Your Excellency i the circumstances of his coming. It is per haps not hidden from you that a portion of our Army, after clearing the enemy away from the Egyptian frontier and across the Sinai I Peninsula, is pressing them up the coast of 1alestine and is now in the neighbourhood of Cazza. In order that our allied operations against the enemy may proceed on a common plan, it is very necessary that there should be close touch between our Army at Gazza and the forces of the Sherif, and Your Excellency and the Army on this side. In order to achieve this end, it was decided that an Officer from . the Egyptian Force should pay us a visit here and that I in turn should send an Officer from my side to Egypt, so that the knowledge\ m possossed by each separate Force, of the doings and plans of the other, should be complete* The Officer whom I sent was « Colonel Leachman, whom you know; and the Officer deputed from Egypt was Mr Ronald Storrs C*M*G*, who is now Oriental Sacre- | tary on the Staff *of the High Commissioner in Egypt and was formerly on the Staff of the late Lord Kitchener* I‘have decided to send, him to Your Excellency in order that he may discuss the present situation with you on my be- '' 1 .half and write me fully regarding the re- ■ 1 1 suit and hear the latest news from you regarding the question of Ibn Rashid and your own plans* i He is an Officer of wide experience and I hope you will treat him as from me and give him your confidence, so that he may be in a position to advise both your self and me* When you have finished your discussions with him, I shall be greatly obliged if you will be so good as to have him sent across with an escort of your own men to the Camp of Sherif Abdallah, from whence he will go to the Egypt Field Force* By this means he will gain much useful knowledge and reach his destina tion quickly. I much hope that you will at the same time think fit to send with him a liaison officer from yourself to His Highness the Sherif, in order that there may be a fifell exchange of views and plans between you* You will realise, I am sure, es- .jf-jnuuik &lt; M mon end. Mr Storrs will discuss with Your Ex cellency the question of Sa f ud bin Subhan and Ibn Rashid and his musabilah and will tell you of the auspicious visit to Baghdad of our friend Fahad Beg ibn Hadhdhal* As Mr Storrs will be seeing you as soon as a letter could reach you, I will V leave further news with him to tell you. Should there be any fresh news to give before he leaves Kuwait, I will send it by telegram. As regards our affairs here, they are going well. We have driven the enemy back towards Tekrit and we ourselves occupy Samarra; while on the Euphrates we hold Feluja; the Turks have 200 or 300 men at Rumadi but they have no strength on the Euphrates. This is what had to be explained. •. especially after talking with Mr Storrs, how important it is, as I have said be fore, that all the allied forces of the Army should have knowledge of one another*s arrangements and should work for the com-Aide memoire for Mr Starrs regarding affairs of Bin Sand. • Bin Baud is likely to want to discuss the following ques tions;- , (i) His obligations under his agreement with us (2) His relations with Bin Rashid (3) The position of Baud ibn Subhan and his relations with Bin Rashid and himself (4) The position of Kuwait in regard to trade with Hail and Syria (5) His relations with the Sherif With regard to 1(1) and (2). You will remember the recent correspondence with Egypt (Sykes). H.M.G. have recently sug gested that Bin Baud should be pressed to attack Bin Rashid. * At the time of Bin Baud’s visit to Kuwait and Basrah at the beginning of this year, when we were deliberating as to what we should pay him in the way of subsidy, and what other assist anca we should give him, it was decided to comply with his re quest to be provided with the sinews of war to the extent of £5000 a month and certain guns and rifles. He has since been given 3000 rifles, 2 machine guns and 2 mountain guns. We could not supply gunners for the guns but did our best to instruct his own, employes how to use them. It is not known with what success. At the time of these discussions, the Govt of India’s view, with which I have been in general agreements that we did not want to push Bin Baud who is not a militsayy genius into serious operations such as the siege of Hail or the provision of a force for co-operation with the troops of the Sherif.. it was considered, that his overt fixnxxx&amp;fcXm ce- c session from the Turks and adherence to us was in itself a great assett owing to the solidity fSfrthe Arab cause which ’ i it would Indicate and that we should be contented by his keening a bedawin. force mobilised in Qasim for harrassing Bin Rashid and preventing him undertaking any expedition towards agxirxxk the Hedjaz. up to now that plan has been successful. True, there has been no great fight, but Bin Baud or one ofHis relations nave been continually in Qasiia since tne be ginning of tne year and in spite of tne assistance received fr froifl tne Turks and tne stimulation of Rasnaid ibn Laiian there nas been no movement towards Medina or against tne ' * snerlf. Egypt now presses us to get Bin sand to attack Bin Rashid without delay, a telegram which i sent to him via Kuwait to that effect has been crossed by a letter from Bin saud telling me that Bin Rashid is making overtures of peace and that he. Bin saud, nas informed him that he is inclined 'itAkv^ ■* to de-’-ao but cannot proceed further in the matter without reference to the British authorities, m the meanwhile, news received locally corroborates Bin Baud’s statement. The - 4 change in the attitude of Bin Rasid is due of course to our capture of Baghdad- and expulsion of the Turks. When Fan ad Beg first arrived here he showed me corre spondence spa which he had with Bin Rashid, ending un with a letter from him (Fahag Beg) informing him that he had backed the wrong horse and that he, Fanad, intended to enter into re lations with the new Government at Baghdad and that Bin Rashid had better alter his attitude before it was too late. He said that he expected Bin Rashid in the course o f the next few weeks would endeavour to come in to us through the med iation of himself (Fa&amp;ad). Yesterday when i told the latter that Bin Rashid was asking Bin saud to make peace with him, k he changed his note and said Bin Rasjd was only doing this to gain time as his troops were scattered and if he,were attacked now he would be in a very weak position. Fahad con cluded by strongly recommending that Bin Saud should be en- \ •• couraged to attack him at once. My view of the question is- this. Our object is to elim inate Bin Rashid either by winning him over or by crushing him. it matters little to us which alternative ig pursued. v From some points of view it would be better to crush him but we should then be met with the problem of the disposal of Han which will be one of some delicacy, if he is really ready to come in on terms which would allow us to fLeei safe as regards the Shammar and sure of being able to keen theTurte out of central Arabia we may just as well dlsoose of hiin on pacific linos, unloss you find when you have roached Bin Saud that the matter has already developed so far as to commit us to one alternative more than the other, this will he the main Question that you win need to discuss fully with Bin Baud and put us in possession of your views. From the Baghdad point of view provided, as i have said, that we can be sure that the Shammar ceases to be a Turkish stronghold and that Bin Rashid Joins the Arab Confederacy, our Euphrates Valley difficulty wm be'greatly simplified. Should you find that Bin Baud is ready and anxious to attack Bin Rashid, it needs to be considered what he is in a position to do. A good deal of water has oassed under the bridge since we made our arrangements with him and as the pos ition now is, hifc&gt; desultory tactics consist of worrying Bin Rashid’s irxsxiss tribes when opportunity offers*really is ; not^&gt;f much use to us. i doubt, however, from what Bin Baud heps always said to me, if he has got the power® or ability to besiege Han with any chance of success, it is quite possible that if he pressed him from gasim a n d ibn Shaaian from they might be able to tiring him to terms. Before leaving this subject i had better touch on the question of the supply of guns to Bin Baud. • ■ . * 1 ' \ ■ y * ' / \ The High Commissioner offered a battery of field guns (but to be sent to him from here. The battery does not include personnel and this Force is unable to provide it. it is also doubtful whether the transport of a field battery with per sonnel to gasim is a practical proposition especially at the present season. Of this you win be able to form an opinion after the experience of your Journey to gasim. in any case it will tape some time to obtain the personnel from India and i think any suggestion of Bin Baud’s in this direction should prima facie be discouraged. As to (3). as regards saud ibn Subhan, Bin Saud writes:- I neither need his aid nor do i trust him. He has about rc followers and his attitude is no less equivocal than that of the Asiam who are' with him. At the same time the stay of ibnIt&gt;n Subhan on your side is rathor beneficial to tbe snammar and to Bin Rashid, if you wish to keep him, he should either be kept, in Zubajxr or made to 3oin the Dhafir and sever all relations with Bln Rashid '. At the time ibn Subhan came in to us, when it was clear that he had a considerable number of Shammar with him, it was evidently worth while keeping him as an antidote to Bin Rashid and for protection on the desert side. But we now want to re-consider our position in regard to him, and prima facie i agree with Bin Baud, we can keep him in Zubair or send him away, if necessary, to some other place m the occupied Territory, but it depends on developments regarding Bin Rashid, if we make friends with Bin Rashid, it will probably be better to effect a reconciliation between him and ibn Subhan, or alternatively, keep ibn away so that ibn Rashid might ax ways fear that if he gave trouble we should set up Ibn Subhan in his place. On the whole perhaps the latter alternative would be the wisest. As regards (4). This question of trade from Kuwait to Qasim, or to the enemy, has been the subject of much differenc of opinion ^Mii) controversy with Bln saud. The late Shaikh of . 1 Kuwait was full of promises and assurances but was too slack to carry them out. The present Shaikh, according to the Pol itical Agent, has been more energetic; but whatever assur- ances are given by merchants loading up goods from Kuwait, it is very difficult to obtain any affective guarantees that the goods are not diverted after they get away inland. Bin Saud says that the Shaikh of Kuwait could stop it If he chooses : the Shaikh of Kuwait retorts that the trade is all done by Bin sand’s people and that the remedy rests with him. The only certain remedy would be our placing a cordon of British troops round Kuwait, feut this is a serious measure which might cause alarm and In any case would need a reference to and consideration by H.M.E. It would be wen if you would discuss this question with Bln saud and also with the politi cal Agent of Kuwait when you are there, and see if any fur ther measures can be suggested to cope with the evil. Suchenormous prices obtain both in Hail and in Syria for the necessaries of life, that the traders to the interior are naturally prepared to take great risks to get their stuff through. , , • * ^ ' As to (5). With regard to his relations with the Sharif, i think you know an that I can ten you. ‘ \ On Bin Baud’s part there is a very strong feeling of Je a lousy and determination not to be lorded over by the Sherif. On the sherif’ s side there is thio^^tiiw*) hankering for suprmacy over Bin saud and* desire to get the latter to recog nise his position. I Quite understand t^a point of view of Sir Mark.Sykes that it would be convenient to get Bin Saud to make some specific recognition of the Sharif’s paramount ■ position : on the other hand, i sympathise with Bin Saud . t in his reluctance to to anything of the sort, it is a subject you will have to a proach very cautiously, if indeed, you can touch ueon at all, for as a personnel of the Egyptian Administration your motives will naturally be under suspicion j I think the most w,e can expect 16 that Bin Saud should send a Liaison Representative with you to the Sherif or to Sherif Abdauah. The amount you can say to Bin Saud on the subject . ; ; . • ' ( * and the personality of the individual whom he decides to send with you ta) the Sherif are both matters for which you must depend for success mainly on your own skill in talking witx Bin -saud into an amenable frame of mind. Apart from the above specific questions there win no doubt be a good many others on matters of interest which win arise in discussion,' such as what, if any, other means . there are for promoting the interests of the allied elements r I in Egy t, Arabia and Iraq for making progress against the enemy.^Jl~l V A* Telegram from Sir P.

Chiefs despatch of force to support I bn Rashid against Sheriff of Mecca, and is said to be making preparations for the purpose. Ibn Rashid is reported to be marching against Sheriff. Sheikhs of Ibb have revolted against Turks and Imam. After above meeting four thousand men of Dhu Mahomet and Dhu Hussein joined forces with Kaid Bin Harsan successor of Abu Has. Several thousand Imam men under the command of Abu Naib said to be marching towards lawia object unknown, possibly watching developments. The local policy of Turks at present seems to be to dissipate power of Idrisi and after the war to combine with Imam in crushing him. altogether.

Authentic news received that when r he left Ubn Rashid he was accompanied by Turkish soldiers Three days out from Jabal he met Hataim and Fit Harb Arabs of Ha,rrah and got information that they intended to plunder him. Ibn Rashid came out to help but his men fled with the exception of few men of Hail and Ajman. None of the tribe of Sharamar were present as they were separated into two parties, one of which, the Aslam, has joined me, and of thse with Ibn Raehid some were cousins of Tuwallah while second party, the Abdah, intended to hejib !bn Rashid but gave up their intention as they feared t/^ _ t^t I would take their property. On hearing this other rt Arabs with Ibn Rashid took refuge in hills of Salatn and Aja.

Stewart, C.B., Political Resident at Aden, To— The Hon’ble Mr. A. H. Grant, C.S.I., C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign.&amp; Political Department, Simla. Please see paragraph 2 of my Weekly Letter dated 2nd instant. The Abdali Sultan s confidential agent at Lahej writes that the Turks and Somalis who had gone to the Fadh country have returned to Lahej and that the news of the British landing at Shukra came 3 days after their return. 2. The agent refers to the subsidy fixed for the Fadli Sultan by the Turks which is Rs. 360 per mensem. It has been paid for about a year, the cost being defrayed out of the revenue derived from a garden belonging to a relation of the Abdali Sultan. In addition to this, the Fadli's son, Abdulla gets $30 a month. 3. The same agent reports a rumour that the Akrabi Shaikh who is a prisoner at Lahej will be liberated. I have heard from other sources that he has already been released, presumably on parole. J m th® agent says that there is increasing difficulty about money and the Turks have no grain left; that they are buying the same from the inhabitants on credit, promising to repay in kind when received from the Yemen : that salaries are in arrears. . 5 - Said Pasha is said to have received a letter from the Sherif of Mecca urging him to surrender to him. 6 5 \ 6. The Abdali’s agent reports that two Turkish ofificers are on their way from Syria having got through Medina, with £2,000 for the Turks in the Yemen The Idnsi has also reported a rumour that a large sum of money has been sent from Nejd via Nejran for the use of the Turks in Asir and the Yemen. I have wired this to His Britannic Majesty’s High Commissioner, Cairo. It is possible that they are both referring to the same sum. 7. The Sherif of Behan writes that the Zaidis wrote to the Kadi of Behan to go and see them but the latter declined to do so. He says that the Turks have offered a reward to any one who will kill or hand over the Kadi to them and that they (the lurks) put up a Saiyid to kill the Kadi, but that when he (the Sherif) came to know of the plot, he at once expelled the Saiyid. The Sherif expresses satisfaction at the occupation of Baghdad by the British. 8 News gleaned from a messenger sent down by the Sultan of Mokalla shows that the Sultan is little or no nearer a settlement with the Kathiri. His Wazir reports they will be perhaps more amenable as they have received a letter from Ah Saeed Pasha saying that he cannot support them with men and arms. The Sultan has again asked us to endeavour to get the proceeds of certain Kathiri property m Singapore held up until the Kathiris come to their senses. This is under consideration. , S ^ e messen g er reports that the Upper and Lower Aulaki Shaikhs and the Aulaki of Bir Id are at present in Mokalla for the purpose of entering into agreements with the Kaiti Sultan to assist each other against the Turks. !0 A rumour has come in yesterday that Sultan Abdul Kadir has been elected T adli Sultan by the tribesmen at the fair of Shaikha^Sa’ida. The old Sultan is said to have been present and to have accepted the situation. He has returned to his dar m the hills and declines to return Abyan or Shukra until the safety of his lire is assured. All this requires confirmation. JSJ7 19 ir G. M.
