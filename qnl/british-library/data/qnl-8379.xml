BAUODA, December 28^, 1874. [ Private. ] My Lord, I have to-niglit received yours of 24tli. In the meantime your Lordship will have received my telegram reporting the confession of the Jemadar after being solemnly warned by myself that I would not pardon him, also my telegram reporting his having thrown himself into a well. I now enclose a memorandum drawn up by my Assistant, Mr. Richey, giving a resumd of much of the direct and corroborative evidence that has come out. To-morrow morning the Commissioner of Police will proceed to Bombay, where he will take the evidence of Colonel Phayre's butler, will cause the evidence already taken, as well as his report thereon, to be immediately put in print, and will, at my requisition, cause the opinion of Mr. Scoble, the Advocate- General, to be obtained on the evidence generally, and more particularly as to the probability or even possibility of the evidence being the result of a conspiracy. Mr. Souter will then return to Baroda, and all the papers will be submitted to your Lordship without any delay whatever. As regards the general situation of affairs, matters become clearer and easier to me; and, had it not been for this question of attempted poisoning, I should not have considered the case of Baroda more difficult or complicated than other duties which I have had to discharge. And even as matters stand, I think I see my way quite clearly towards the reformation of the adminis tration of the State, and I am confident that three years' proper management would not only restore the finances and general prosperity of the Baroda State, but would put it on the road to a surplus, and tend to make it quite an ordi narily thriving Native protected State, and this principally owing to an extraordinarily fertile soil and to the possibility of easily increasing the land revenue by again bringing under the plough large areas which high assessment and general mismanagement have heretofore thrown out of cultivation.( 2 ) I will now briefly resume the position to wliich my lalbours have led me,; down to date. I desire to premise that, in so far as I am personally concerned I have not a complaint to lodge against His Highness. I am myself certain, and the Minister and others assure me, that he is not only willing but eager to obtain my advice and to act thereon. But I have to bear in mind that I am not acting as the ruler of the State, but as the adviser of a ruler placed in peculiar and even abnormal circumstances. This sentence will become clearer as I proceed. CHANGE OF MINISTRY. After lengthened controversy the Minister called on me two days ago, and expressed to me the deliberate wish of himself and colleagues to resign. The Guicowar also called upon me, and, while treating the question lightly, gave me to understand that he considered Mr. Dadabhai inexperienced in affairs and unable to conduct the administration of a Mahratta State, with which he was comparatively unacquainted, and wherein he possessed neither the confi dence nor the sympathy of the nobles or people. Dadabhai, on the other hand, stated that he had several times during the past year found himself in a false position, and had expressed his desire to resign, but that His Highness had always opposed this move,—that recently the Guicowar had again interfered in the routine of administration, and wished to treat him as a mere Karkoon; secondly, that, so long as certain personal friends of His Highness remained near his person, the proceedings of the present Minis try would always be subject to hidden obstruction. He added that, so long as the Guicowar had been in constant conflict with the Residency, His Highness had found himself compelled to seek support in his Ministry, but that now that the Guicowar had in earnest resolved to follow my advice, he had been comparatively careless of his Minister's advice, and consequently that, while the Guicowar adhered to his promises given under my advice in large affairs, his friends had nevertheless become more potent in undermining the Minister's action in the common routine of business.( 3 ) I informed both parties that it was beyond the scope of my instructions t(/ dictate, or even suggest, to the Guicowar the dismissal or the appointment of his Minister. These conversations passed at the Residency, but in separate rooms. At length the Guicowar begged me to call the Minister and be present at the inter view, and I reluctantly acquiesced. An interview followed, at which I explained that, before hearing any discussion, I must explicitly reiterate that, while happy to aid His Highness and his Minister to the limit of my instructions, I must posi tively decline to take any active part in the change of Ministry, or in any way to take on myself responsibilities which legimately devolved on His Highness as head of the State. The Minister then repeated his complaints. The Guicowar requested him to specify instances of obstruction. This the Minister did not do, but sub mitted that the obstructions, though unseen, were not the less real. His Highness then said that, if I desired him, he would remove from Baroda the whole of his surroundings; but this, under all the circumstances of the case, I declined to do, and this for the following reasons among others :— \stly, that by so doing I should have exceeded my instructions, and • would have committed your Lordship's Government to respon sibilities which are apart from our policy; 2ndly, because I was aware that the Guicowar really had no confidence in the administrative ability or experience of his Minister; and Zrdly, and principally, because the name of His Highness had been so directly and circumstantially implicated in the attempt to poison the late Resident that I foresaw that, if I caused the removal of His Highness's personal friends, and afterwards found that your Lordship's Government considered the guilt of His Highness to be morally proved in the poison case, it might be open to His Highness to plead that, while outwardly affording him the fair trial accorded in my instructions, I had at the same time isolated him in his palace, and left him a prey to the machinations of his enemies, who are legion.( 4 ) The interview broke up without final result; but this morning the Guicowar called on me with a list of officials whom he desired to obtain from the Go - ernment of Bombay to fill vacant places in the new Ministry. This list I at once foi'warded to Bombay, and a copy to the Foreign Secretary. His Highness again implored me to name a Prime Minister; but I explained to His Highness, in the kindest and most courteous manner, that he asked me to do what nothing but the explicit orders of the Viceroy would induce me to accede to. His Highness then requested me to obtain the services of the Nawab Eaiz Alice Khan. I replied that the Nawab was already charged with the affairs of Kotah at my instance, and that I would not injure Kotah any more than Baroda. THE SIRDARS. I have to-day troubled your Lordship with a long despatch concerning the Sirdars and other military classes, and I deem myself safe in submitting that, consequent on my personal interview with them, they are entirely re-assur ed, and would be wholly guided by my advice. THE QUESTION OF ALIENATIONS. These complicated and numerous tenures are receiving my constant consi deration. There is no fear of present annoyance from them, and I am prepar ing a report showing the manner in which these tenures may be equitably enquired into and disposed of. In this question I shall be materially assisted by Mr. Eichey, who, as Talookdaree Settlement Officer, has acquired an intimate practical acquaintance with the girass, tora girass, desai, inam, religious, and talookdaree tenures. To my mind it is amazing that these questions should still remain unsettled. REVENUE. A few days ago I submitted a report on the land revenue question, and I understand that the recent proclamation has had good effect; but there remains( 5 ) among the cultivating classes want of reliance on the promises of the ^Guicowar's Government; and, in my opinion, nothing less than a reduced as sessment combined with a persistent adherence to justice and moderation in the collection of revenue will avail to restore the confidence of the agri cultural classes. FINANCE. My time is being largely occupied with the details of this very important subject. I have now before me some of the financial statements deposited, rather than arranged, in the records of this Office during the period when the finances of the Baroda State were subject to the inspection of the British Bepresentative. I have also before me the general financial and the detailed analytical statements of the income and outlay of the last revenue year. I enclose, for your Lordship's information, an abstract of last year's income and expenditure. It is, I believe, moderately correct; but perhaps the income may be somewhat over-stated, although Dadabhai assures me it is quite correct. The subjoined few remarks may perhaps assist your Lordship to a thorough understanding of the abstract. liou mil observe that the column of estimated revenue as^resrates o o o 1,02,65,200. Column 4 shows the revenue expenses in the districts, and includes also the loss to the State incidental to alienations. The column 4 totals 20,07,400. Column 5 shows the net revenue actually received in the treasury on account of land and sayer revenue in the districts, after deducting loss by alienations and cost of district revenue management. This column totals 70,02,980, or say roundly 70 lakhs in rupees. But this total of net revenue does not include the following items :— 1st. —No. 14, being opium assessments in the Weesnuggur Mahal, which total 2,87,455. ^Indly. —The ijara of opium in Baroda itself, totalling in round numbers 2,25,000.( 6 ) Zrdly. —The name entered 29 in the abstract, Nowsaree Mahal, of which 12,00,000 had been collected, leaving an outstanding; balance of about 11,38,932. Mhly.—No. 30 in the abstract, named ' Killa nihai,' totalling 39,001. hthly, —The tribute received through the British Government total ling 6,50,000. Thus your Lordship will perceive that the account of income stands as follows :— 70,02,980 2,87,455 2,25,000 12,00,000 39,001 6,50,000 94,04,436 It appears, therefore, that the revenue and tribute actually received, after deducting loss by alienations and cost of district management, have aggre gated during the past revenue year a little over 94 lakhs of rupees. The finances are calculated in Baroda rupees of the value of 13 annas and a half each; but as the disbursements are calculated in the same rupee, the bal ance of outlay and income is not affected. I remarked above that No. 29 in the abstract included a balance of uncollected revenue amounting to 11,38,932, while Nos. 1 to 28 inclusive show in column 7 a balance due of 13,29,713. Thus the total amount of uncollect ed revenue during the past year is— 11,38,932 13,29,713 24,68,645( 7 ) It is plain, therefore, that, if the assessment were lowered by the amount o^ 24 lakhs, the revenue received by the State would remain what it has been during the past year, while the cultivators would be relieved. As I mentioned in my former letter, the State expenditure of the past year aggregated 1,30,00,000. In the statement of reductions, which the Guicowar has personally handed to me. His Highness shows reductions to the amount of 10 lakhs, and, so far as I can at present forecast, it will be practicable, with the aid of independent experienced examiners, to further reduce the outlay until it shall fall within an income of 94 lakhs of Baroda rupees. CONCLUSION. As at present informed, then, I consider the financial question manageable ; and, in so far as I have enquired, there is no other question in the State which may not, with ordinarily good administration, be handled with a success equal to that which may prevail in the average of other Native protected States. It would be premature for me at the present critical moment to sketch the manner in which it may seem to me most advisable to arrive at the results indicated, although modes of operation calculated to meet possible contingencies are constantly before my mind, and I entertain no doubt, and feel no anxiety, as to the practicability of restoring the Baroda State to a condition such as the Paramount Power may reasonably expect to obtain in one of its Native States. I respectfully apologise to your Lordship for penning this letter in the hand-writing of one of my Assistants; but I am dictating by candlelight, and I am desirous of sparing my eyesight, and of sending this letter by to-morrow morning's post. Your Lordship's Paithful and obedient servant, LEWIS PELLY. The Eight Hon'ble LORD NORTHBROOK, g. m. s. i., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.( 8 ) Enclosure in a letter from Colonel Sir Lewis Pellt, k. c. s. i., dated Decemher IWi, 1874. 1 The police enquiry appears to liave resulted in the detection of two dis tinct intrigues having for their object the corruption or the murder of Colonel Phayre through the instrumentality of private servants and peons. The agents in each case for the corruption of the servants are two men— Yeshwuntrao Yewle^and an Arab, Salum; the former a man constantly employed about the Residency in personal matters between the Resident and the Guicowar of an unofficial nature, and the latter a constant attendant on His Ilighness in his bi-weekly visits to the Resident and a confidential Jasood well known at the Residency. The first intrigue discovered by Mr. Souter was traced from intelligence that a hack bullock cart driver in the camp had taken an Ayah from the house of Mr. Boevey, the Assistant Resident and son-in-law of Colonel Phayre, to the palace of the Guicowar. Following up this intelligence, the evidence of seven persons was taken, which is briefly summarized as follows :— 1^.—Ameena, the Ayah. She was in the service of Mrs. Phayre up to her departure for England. While the Baroda Enquiry Commission was sitting, she was induced by the Residency Chobdar, Eaizoo, to go and visit the Guicowar. She was taken into the presence of the Guicowar 5 ^ with Eaizoo bv Salum the * By hack driver Khasbhai. L . ,1^1 . 1 n i • Arab. (She knows the Maharaja personally, having often seen him at the Presidency, and once been in the room with him when his women came to see Mrs. Phayre). The Maharaja personally conversed with her, asking her to get Mrs. Phayre to influence the Resident in his favor. After Mrs. Phayre went to England, the Ayah took service with that lady's daughter, Mrs. Boevey, in Baroda, Mrs. Boevey living in the Residency with her father. Colonel Phayre. She then paid a second visit to the Guicowar—on this occasion persuaded by Salum and accompanied by the peon Kureem. cartoThari-Ssundui! 1 ' 0 The Guicowar talked to her about using sorcery, ' jadoo,' against the Resident. She said that English people were not amenable to sorcery. Two or three days after this interview,( 9 ) .Kureem, the peon, came to her house, and gave her Es. 100 from the Maharaja, Maying that Yeshwuntrao had given Us. 200, half for himself and half for her.' Hie third visit, also at the instigation of Salum, was made by the Ayah in company with her servant boy Chotoo. She was met In the cart 01 nack driver i.i-u i ioii ,, Daood. ^ the palace by Salum, and taken before the Guicowar, as on the previous visits. During this visit the conver sation commenced with the subject of the birth of a son to Luxmeebhai, and what was being said about it at the Residency, and then the Guicowar put a question to the Ayah as to whether she could not administer something to the Resident which should have the effect of making him friendly to the Guicowar. The language used was very cautious, but the Ayah understood it to suggest the administration of poison, and treated the supposed hint with indignant refusal. A few days after this visit she received Es. 50 from Salum at her house. 2nd, Srd, and Uh. —The hack drivers—Khasbhai, Sundul, and Daood state that they took Ameena as above to the palace. Daood says that her husband, Abdulla, came to fetch his cart. Kith. Abdulla states that Ameena is his wife. He knows of her three visits to the Guicowar, corroborates her statements as to the times, the persons who accompanied her, and that of hack driver Daood that he fetched his cart on the last occasion. He also makes the same statement as Ameena regarding the money paid, and adds that \eshwuntrao Yewle promised to get him service with the Maharaja. He recognises and identifies four letters found in his house as having passed between him and his wife when he was absent from her during the last hot weather with his master at Mahabuleshwur. §tli. The Ayah s servant boy, Chotoo, states that he accompanied her to the palace as above. 1th, —Peon Kureem states that he accompanied the Ayah to the palace as above, first calling at Salum's house and taking him with them.( 10 ) Besides the above, the four letters identified by Ahdulla, the Ayah's, husband, as having passed between him and his wife make mention of SaluC^ ha and Yeshwuntrao as persons with whom the writers had intimate relations, or from whom they anticipated something further. The second matter detected by Mr. Souter is of a far graver nature, M and appears, from the two statements subjoined, to have been a direct attempt m made by the Guicowar himself, employing the same agents, Yeshwuntrao and th Salum, to compass the death of the Resident by means of poison to be an administered by his butler, or by the peons of the Residency. The fact of the 01 attempted poisoning of Colonel Phayre is of course beyond doubt; but Mr. w( Souter's enquiries led him to conclude that in the investigation which Colonel P* Phayre had himself conducted he had followed a false scent. Je The facts elicited in that enquiry, however, pointed to Eowjee, Havildar of peons, as the last person who had access to the room in which the poisoned ta sherbet stood, and, acting on this, Eowjee was arrested and questioned. His ar manner strengthened the suspicion which had been formed against him, and Ei on promise of pardon he made a very long and circumstantial statement, which ai is briefly summarized as below;— ^ M Ptowjee was first tampered with by Salum some two months before the sitting of the Baroda Enquiry Commission. Salum told him that the Maharaja a desired to see him, and arrangement was made and carried out by which he was ^ taken to the house of Yeshwuntrao, and thence, in company with him and ^ Salum, to the presence of the Guicowar in a private room in his new palace. 111 The Guicowar asked him to keep him informed of what passed at the Residency, ^ and also whether he could get the Jemadar of peons, Nursoo, to help him, and to visit the palace. Rowjee agreed to both requests, and paid several ^ visits to the Guicowar before the sitting of the Commission, always in company ^ with Yeshwuntrao and Salum. During the sitting of the Commission he paid ^ three visits, and in one visit asked for money on a plea of marriage expenses, w and obtained Rs. 500 through Yeshwuntrao shortly after. When he visited ^ the Maharaja he was in the habit of taking with him, as company on the road at night, either Kharbhai or Jugga, both men employed at the Residency, and rc Jugga used also occasionally to write notes for him to Salum, conveying U information to be given to the Guicowar.( 11 ) hen he got the Us. 500 from Yeshwuntrao, he lent Jugga E,s. 100, and ha£l an anklet of about Rs. 100 made, spending the balance on the marriage. Soon after the close of the Commission, Salum told Rowjee that he had got over the Jemadar Nursoo, and it was arranged that he should come to the Maharaja the following Sunday with Rowjee. The visit accordingly was made, \ eshwuntrao and Salum accompanying the Jemadar and Rowjee to the presence of the Guicowar. The Jemadar was promised liberal rewards and favours for information which he promised to send from the Residency. Other visits of the same nature were paid before April 1874, when the Resident went to Nowsaree on tour. At Nowsaree Salum corrupted the Resident's butler, Pedro, and Rowjee through Yeshwuntrao and Salum obtained Rs. 250 for the Jemadar Nursoo, which was afterwards paid at Baroda to his brother. On the Resident's return to Baroda, the butler, Pedro, was several times taken before the Guicowar by Rowjee in the usual manner with Yeshwuntrao and Salum. On one of these the Guicowar desired him to use his knowledge of English to report to him conversations at the Residency. Pedro went on leave, and after his return again went as before to the Guicowar. On this occasion the Maharaja told him he had some very important work for him, and Pedro agreed to do it, if it lay in his power. Yeshwuntrao then handed the Guicowar a packet which the latter gave Pedro, telling him to put it in his master's food. Pedro was afraid of any sudden consequences, but the Guicowar assured him that there would be no result for two or three months, at the end of which time his master would either die or go mad. Then Pedro consented to do as desired. The Jemadar's visits to the Guicowar with Rowjee continued, but he was not in formed of Pedro's having gone to the palace. Rowjee received Rs. 300 from the Jemadar as half the sum given for their joint present from the Guicowar. About three weeks or a month before the attempt to poison the Resident, the Jemadar and Rowjee were sent for, and went in the usual way to the palace, where the Guicowar, after complaining that the Resident was very hard upon him, asked them whether they could not give him something ia his food, and Salum and Yeshwuntrao urged them to the business by promises of very large rewards and favours. Hiey consented, and the Guicowar said that the substance to be administered would be given them by Yeshwuntrao and Salum. A few days after, the Jemadar gave Rowjee two powders to be given in three doses. It( 12 ) had been arranged that the poison to be administered should be mixed in some sherbet which the Resident was in the habit of drinking on his return from yds morning walk. Accordingly Rowjee, two or three days after receiving the powders, put them into Colonel Phayre's sherbet \ but as no result apparently followed, the Guicowar sent again for the Jemadar and Rowjee, and blamed them for not acting according to their instructions. Rowjee said he had done what was wanted of him, but supposed that the poison was not strong enough. The Guicowar said he would give another, and Salum gave the Jemadar a packet accordingly; this the Jemadar gave Rowjee the next morning, and a day or two after Rowjee mixed the contents in the Resident's sherbet, dissolving them first in water in a small bottle, as he had been directed to do. On Colonel Phayre's return he drank the sherbet. Rowjee divided the contents of the first packet into three doses as directed, and put them up in paper, and kept them in a secret pocket in his belt. He identifies a small packet containing a powder found in the pocket referred to as one of the powders which was left. Rowjee identifies ornaments of the value of about Rs. 420 as made out the money received from the Guicowar. The Jemadar Nursoo states that he was first solicited to visit the Guicowar by Rowjee, but eventually was prevailed upon by the united solicitations of Yeshwuntrao, Salum, and Rowjee, that he went as stated by Rowjee, paid the visits as detailed, and in the later interviews became, also as described by Rowjee, an accomplice in the scheme for poisoning the Resident. The differ ences in the statement of the Jemadar consist in an addition to the narrative of the last interview to the effect that, as they were leaving the Guicowar's presence, Yeshwuntrao gave something—a small bottle or something of that size—to Salum, who passed it on to Rowjee, and in the statement that the money which he received to be shared with Rowjee was Rs. 800, the half of which would be Rs. 400, and Rs. 300 as stated by Rowjee; the Jemadar adds that of the Rs. 400 given to Rowjee the latter was to pay Rs. 100 to Jugga, which reduces the discrepancy materially. Besides these two statements, those of Jugga and Kharbhai were taken, and corroborate the evidence of Rowjee and the Jemadar as to the part taken by them in the proceedings narrated.( 13 ) Eowjee's statement was taken on 24th, 25tli, and 26th instant. On the 26th fne Jemadar was brought up for examination before the Governor General's Agent, and warned that he would make his confession at his own peril, and without any prospect of pardon. The statement, as described above, was given by him on these terms. After the recording of his statement he was allowed to go to dinner in the Residency garden in the custody of two police men. The garden well being immediately near the spot, he seized an oppor tunity for springing through a narrow opening in the parapet of the well, and would have been drowned had not the constables promptly jumped in and rescued him. He was at once questioned as to his motive by the Governor General's Agent, and as to whether he had received any ill-usage. He empha tically denied any bad treatment, and attributed his attempted suicide to shame and remorse. On the 25th instant the belt of the peon Howjee was carefully examined, and in it, in a pocket made by a slit in the cloth concealed under the loop of the cross belt, was found a packet containing a white powder, which Ilowjee indentifies as above stated. The late Eesident, Colonel Phayre, had, immediately after the attempt to poison him, arrested Rowjee, and his belt had then been given to another man, who has worn it ever since. The packet of powder is very small, and would not have been discovered by any one who was not informed of the secret pocket. Yeshwuntrao and Salum have both been apprehended. Both say they know nothing of any of the facts deposed to. On the statements being read to them, each evinced intense nervous distress. J. B.
