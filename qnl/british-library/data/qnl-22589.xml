OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W. 1. P.Z.751/34. 1st February 1934. My dear Loch, In response to a request from Powle, I send herewith a copy of the memorandum of a conversation with Hendel of the Foreign Office on the 15th December on future policy in regard to qatar, copies of which were sent to the Political Resident and the Government of India by the air mail of 22nd December, under our printed letter P.Z.8204/33. I am sending a copy of this letter to Fowle. Yours sincerely, eut.Colonel p.G. Loch, Political Agency, Bahrein.J m CONPIDjjNTlAI, . INDIA CPFTOK . ^ P.Z. /33. N 9conversation on 15th DecsnibGr 1933 witn ivir. G. W, hand el, Foreign Office, on future policy in regard to Qatar. The Question of future policy in regard to qciuar, do th generally ana with particular reference to olio questions raised Dy any oil concession that might be granted there, was discussed iniornally with Mr .Rendel on one lt&gt;tn DecemlDer* On the question 01 general policy I recalled that the position was that ^atar had an a rea of rather over 3,000 square miles and a population of some 26,000 (1917) • Our xelections with it were governed by a Treaty (on the general line of the Trucial Treaties) made with the present Sheikh by sir Percy Cox in 1916. We had agreed at the time that three articles of that Treaty, viz., Articles 7 (admission of British subjects to Qatar for trade); 8 (admission of an agent on behalf of H.M.G.); and 9 (establishment of post and telegraph offices in Qatar), snoula not come into operation for the present. We had also given the Sheikh an undertaking in general terms to grant him good olfices 'should I or my subjects be assailed b.y land within the territories of Qatar.' (Article 11). in 1921, the Sheikh had represented that he was alarmed lest some of his townspeople should become Akhwan and go over to Ion Saud and had asked whether ri.-ui,Lr» would assist him should he be attacked from the interior. He had been informed in reply that H.M.G. were not/a. not prepared to promise more than diplomatic assistance shoula he he attacked hy Ihn Baud. Nothing of much consequence as earing on general relations with H.M.G. had occurred in Qatar between then and 1932, when, alter unsuccessful negotiations with the oheikh for aerodrome facilities, which had broken down because of our refusal to give him the formal guarantee ^ of protection in all circumstances which he was anxious to secure, we had narked out a Landing ground by dropping bags of chalk from the air near Dohah and haa warned him that if aircraft using it were molested he would be called to account, but that if he treated them well he would be rewarded, in the same year the A.P.O.C. had, with our knowledge and permission, entered into airect negotiations with the Sheikh for the purpose of securing an oil concession which, however, if obtained, would have to be transferred to the Iraq Petroleum Company, in accordance with the Group Agreement between that Company and the A.P.O.G. Negotiations were still proceeding, but the sheikh had adopted an evasive attitude towards the British political authorities in the Gulf in respect of them. The latest information from the Company was to the effect that he had been anxious to secure their concurrence in the exercise by him of jurisaiction in any disputes which might arise between his subjects and their employees; that he had asked them to undertake to supply him with arms for the defence of their works (a request which strictly speaking was hardly consistent with Article 3 of his Treaty of 1916); and that he had indicated, in connection with the arbitration provisions to be included in the concession under negotiation, that he was apprehensive of the political Resident; was -anxious that some international body such as the permanent court of International justice at The Hague shoula be referred to, but disliked the suggestion that the/the President of the Court should be specifically nominated, on tua ground that he might be an Englishman. There seemed now some possibility that the a .P.O .u . might secure the concession from tne Sheikh, who appeared to be actively interested ana it was probably, therefore, of immediate importance to consider what steps we snould take to tighten up our general political relations with Qatar. The most important points were: jurisdiction, and the oringing into force of tne dormant aiticlas of tne Sheikh's Treaty. If, however, we were going to- raise these'major questions we might as well take ohe opportunity to secure the Air Ministry desiderata in i egard to aerodromes, etc., from the Sheikh, it was, oi course, clear tnat no action could be taken until we n^ci consulted and had the reconinendations of the Government of India and ohe Political Resident, who are both closely c on c e rn e d wi th th e Question. On the question of jurisdiction it would be debirable to aim at an agreement on the lines of those in lorce in Koweit and Bahrein, the effect of which would be to transfer jurisdiction over foreigners in tne State to htivi.Lr, Much difficulty might be anticipated in persuading uiic; Sheikh, who was an obstinate and suspicious old nan with a rather narrow outlook, to agree to any such surrender of his rights; out, particularly ii tnere was to be any risk of an influx of foreign employees, the point was one of real substance, 0 ' The appointment of a political Officer in Qatar might be of rather less urgency. It seemed unlikely to be en inviting place for a European. No European, except for casual travellers, had entered it; it nad no large town; (the/4. (tiic population of Dohah iri 1917 was about 12,000); its population was backward ana appeared to be to a large extent nomadic Bedouin; and the ordinary resources of civilisation wnich were to oe found in varying degrees in Koi/veio, ounrain and iwuscatwere entirely lacking. On the other hand, if there was to be a serious oil development in the country, accompanied by the erection of ela.Dora uc; ouildings, refineries, etc., and possibly oy one introuuc uion ox individuals of various nauioxialiuies, it would probaoly be essential to have a Political Officer on the spot to exercise jurisdiction, ^nd, on^e the concession had oeen negotiated, to serve (as in Bahrein) as the channel of correspondence between uie Company and the Sheikh. Clearly, however, large Questions oi policy were involved, and it was conceivable that it might be necessary in the long run to bring lorciole pressure to Dear on the Sheikh to secure our desiderata. If it came to that, it was not irrelevant uhoot ^atar, which was a rectangle ol 'which the two long ^idos and one snort side were oounded by the sea, was in -■oni- No.js a,Iraosu as open to foreiDie pressure as an island such tts Bahrein, altnough nothing could of course be done in the desert hinterland.. ^ So much for the general political position. The next Question to consider was the problems which might arise in connection with the grant of an oil concession to the A.P.0#C. or any other Company. The Foreign Office had always made it clear that they were anxious to walk very carefully in this part of the world,' so as to avoid an oil war with American oil interests over what was on a long view a relatively unimportant area., and had emphasised in connection with both Koweit and Bahrein/Bdhrsin 'thyii ixiixiQ'ty 'to work on 'tns bus is of £111 opsn cioor policy so fcir cis possitilc* On ths O u Iigt lirxnci 'tiiG Inciici Oiiica and Admiralty, while appreciating the Foreign Office point of view, had been anxious to ao their utmost to secure that for local political reasons, and in view of our special treaty relations ana recponsibilities, any development in these areas siiould be so far as possible under British control. In trie case of Bahrein a compromise had finally been reached which seemed at the moment to be working satisfactorily, but wnich was not in itself ideal, under which the American interests concerned had given certain guarantees as regards the employment of British personnel etc. The position in Koweit was at the moment quite open and would have to be considered further in the ixear iutui e• In tne case oi &lt;^cttar it nad always oeen accepted tnat trie A.«ir'*u#u•, ix tney secured their concession, would have to transfer it to the I.p.G., which was an international body containing only a relatively small British element, but no commitment had been entered into as regards the conditions in respect of British representation and control which -K.M.G, (whose consent was necessary to thegrant b^ the Sheikh of any concession) would attach to their consent, ihe representatives of the A.P.O.G,. in the meeting which had taken place at the India Office on 14th December, of wnich a record was being circulated, had been quite to enter into any permanent commitment as regards the British character of the exploitation of any concession granted (although they had responded well to a suggestion that certain connected safeguards might be covered in exchanges of letters between and the Company) and the point by agreement had been left over for further consideration.'' e tio ' n admitted American interests to ^OP U!lc! concession ana the door was open to t-liem in Kowelt. on the Trucial_Coast our present policy was to exclude all oil concession hunters, whether British or foreign, on the ground of the oackward character of the area ana the risks involved. No interes nt-.d oeen snown for many years by any company in oil in Mscat- With Hasa we were not ourselves concerned, ho suggestion could In these circumstances be made that we nad rex used 'to agree to an 'open door' policy in the Guli where oil was concerned when circumstances were each a 0 to make this possible or had discriminated against trie U.S.A. But the position in Qatar was quite peculiar, as already remarked, it was an uncivilised cuid unaeveloped Arao sheikhdom, the boundaries of which wie unue; fand which non-Asiatic foreigners could at present enter only with the Resident's permission; t-di/h an unadministered nlnterland and a scattered population, possiolllties of alfficulty with which in the event of tneir contact with foreign labourers or non-iisiatic suborainate personnel of the wrong type might well be considerable. If any such trouble arose H.M.G. i-.oulu either have to deal with it themselves or allow it 00 oe dealt with by the foreign powers whose nationals were affected. To allow foreign powers to deal with it woulu, 01 course, ce contrary to our general principles in this part of the world, and tne sheikh was, for that matter, precluded by his treaty engagements from having any aeallngs with foreign powers or receiving their 1 ^preventatives. Assuming, however, that the responsabUlly for/7. for n and ling the situation devolved upon us, it was evident that we were faced with a far more difficult problem in Qatar than elsewhere. Bahrein was an Island and easily suoject to pressure from the sea. Pressure, at any rate on the sea front and on the capital could also he brought to hear in Koweit, though the situation there had many points of lesemolance to Qatar, and special safeguards on similar lines might have to be considered. Iraq and Persia were both more or less civilised countries with a central authority, with a regular system of government and without an unaarninistered hinterland. But the responsibilities in which we might be involved in the case of Qatar, running as it did back into trie desert, with its absence of regular supplies, etc., might be very serious indeed. Having regard to this (assuming that we could not, as on the Trucial Coast, prohibit any oil development) was it quite impossible for Ub to adopt the same line in the matter of oil in Qatar as we had along the whole Arab littoral in connection vvith air procedure? There, with the concurrence of the Poieign Oflice ana the other interested Departments, he haa adopted a lacade policy, which we proposed, if and when the time came, to apply to Qatar also, securing lor ourselves complete control of air facilities, civil 01 military, oeiiind the iacaae of the Sheikh, and declining to allow loreigners to use the Arab air route, save on a line laid down by us, or to visit certain areas/8. areas of the Arab coast, on the ground that the political conaitions there were such that we were not prepared to lace the risks involved, responsibility for dealing with which rested with us under our special treaty relations with the rulers concerned. A type of solution which had occurred to me personally as possible was that we should lay it down as a general rule, to apply to any oil company, whether British or American, which might succeed in obtaining a concession in Qatar, that, for the political reasons which 1 had just explained, the exploitation of the concession ana the local representations of the concessionnaire must be wholly in British hands (no doubt a compromise could be arranged as regards one or two highly expert individuals if it proved impossible to fill their places from British sources). No question of discrimination agair^b American Interests would arise ana our justification if we were challenged through the diplomatic channel would oe that we had dealt with the case on merits; that the political conditions of Qatar were quite special; that while we were prepared to face certain risks in respect of our own nationals we were not prepared to face them in respect of those of ofcier countries; that we equally intended to hold the Sheikhs to their special treaty obligations to us in the natter of dealing with foreign countries, and that while we did not propose necessarily to stipulate that any company, which, or a subsidiary of which, was operating in Qatar, should itself be under complete British control, we could not agree to exploitation or local representation save by personnel of British nationality and subject to certain specific/9. specific understanding, e .g. that the Company would in ^ its dealings with the Sheikh or the local inhabitants be guided by our advice. (The te M s of any reply would, of c ours 6 , turn on et npt o-r v- t t r* i ^ ^ • ^ Lnei or not n.-.G. had intimated their readiness to agree to an American or other non-British company obtaining and operating an oil concession and on the terms of any such agreement, j S. Mr. xtendel said that he appreciated the force of the above arguments, and that while the whole question of policy would, of course, have to 'be considered on the widest grounds and the points at issue would have to be submitted to higher authorities, his personal first impression was that it should be possible to make a strong case for insisting, as regards Qatar, on conditions regard in &amp; m x wis n exploitation and local management on the lines suggested. All this would, however, take time, and meanwhile it seemed to him extremely important that nothing should be done to delay the conclusion of an agreement between the A.F.O.C. and the Sheikh, since any such delay might well result in a purely American interest (e.g.the Standard Oil of California which already holds the Hasa Coast concession) coming in as a serious competitor, and possibly acquiring the concession; in which case .H.M.G. would be in a far more difficult position than if they had to deal with the A.P. O.C. or even the I.P.C. 9» ^r.Rendel explained that in his view there were tv/o types of questions involved, i.e. those between the Company and the Sheikh, which would have to be dealt with in the concession now under negotiation, and those between the Company and H.M.G. , which might involve difficult questions/10. questions of policy. The question of the safeguards to be inserted in any oil agreement to preserve the British character of the operating company on the lines suggested above seemed to him to fall within the second category. 10. He therefore suggested that it should be made clear to the Company at once that we should eventually, in view of the peculiar political situation on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, have to insist on certain safeguards before we could agree to any concession coming into force. These safeguards would be of general application and would apply equally in the case of any concession which the Sheikh might grant. K.M.G. did not wish, however, to delay the conclusion of an agreement between the Company and the Sheilch by holding matters up pending the discussion of the details of these safeguards at this stage. They would therefore suggest that the concession should contain a clause providing that it should not come into force until H.M.G. had given their written consent thereto. This would be in accordance with the Sheikh's treaty obligations towards us. Our eventual consent would then be dependent on our reaching a separate agreement with the Company, which might be embodied in an exchange of letters and which would contain particulars of any safeguards it was eventually decided to insist upon. 11. This would limit the immediate discussion to outstanding points in which H.M.G. had a direct interest between the Company and the Sheikh, such as the question of jurisdiction etc., but would avoid any risk of the concession being lost or delayed while arguments were proceeding/11. proceeding on matters which, did not strictly speaking affect the Sheikh and would in any case be of equal application whatever company was seeking to obtain a c on c e s s i on . 12. Meanwhile, if we could give the Company any indication of the nature of the safeguards, etc., which we should have to insist upon it would be all to the good. 13. It was agreed that a note of the conversation should be prepared to serve as a basis for further considerati on.CONFIDENTIAL. No. 119-S of 1934.

As the result of discussion at the Admiralty it had been thought better, in the interests of avoiding any excuse ±or the introduction of U.S. naval personnel to conduct surveys, etc., and of keeping control of any lighting and buoying arrangements in British hands, to give the Company all possible assistance •n a repayment basis. It was now proposed, aft«r discussion With the Company's representatives, to invite the Government of India, if they saw no objection, to undertake the necessary^work, on a repayment basis so that full control for any buoys laid would be secured to Government. The Company had intimated that the Standard Oil Company of California had placed an expert party at their disposal who would arrive in London from the U.S.A. on 4th January en route for Bahrein to deal with the question of the laying of the proposed submarine pipeline and the connected questions of laying moorages and floats. The meeting took note of the position. II. ^atar Oil Concession. The meeting resumed consideration of the revised oil concession communicated informally by the A.P.O.C. on 11th December 1933, in the light of the record of the discussion which had taken place with the representatives of the Company on 14th December, (P.2.0212/33). Mr.Laithwaite said that the A.P.O.C. were pressing for the earliest possible indication of any amendments that H.M.G. might desire, in the interests of facilitating Mr.Chisholm's negotiations in Qatar, and had been anxiciisior information before Christmas. That was impossible, but it seemed desirable to let them have a letter early next week« The meeting agreed. It was agreed that it would be best first to consider the general procedure to be adopted in negotiating with the Company ana the Sheikh; secondly, the supplementary amendments, if any, to be suggested to the Company in Articles of the revised draft concession other than Article 12; thirdly, Article 12 and the connected questions of British control, exclusive British exploitation of any concession granted (though this point strictly arose on Article 17), and the maintenance of a British Chief 1 Local Representative of the pompany in Qatar. The India Office wiehed c ^° c ,^|®®^ on /consideration in this connection of certain special restrictions, arising out of political conditions in Qatar, which would apply to all Companies applying for concessions whatever their nationality. Ill* A . rrocedure. On the question of procedure, Mr»Laithwaite said that as the A.P.O*C» were apparently willing to cover certain points of special interest to H.M.G. in an exchange of letters (which must of course he of a character binding on the Company and on any transferees or assignees), the simplest course, in the light of previous informal discussion with the Foreign Office, and subject to the viev/s of the meeting, t, a-ope a red to 'b e that there shou-id be • (a) an agreement between the Company and the Sheikh which should be purely commercial in character, possibly on the general lines of the revised draft concession which the Company had now submitted, with such modification of Article 12 and such minor amendments in other articles as might he thought necessary; (D) a subsidiary agreement between the A.P.O.C. and H.M.O. to cover matters of interest primarily to H.M.G. and the Company, rather than to H.M.G. and the Sheikh, or to the Company and the Sheikh, and to deal essentially with political points, agreement, which should be binding not only on the Company, but on any assignee or transferee company, could be either an exchange of letters or a formal agreement, perhaps preierably the latter. The Company at the discussion on 14th Deceube ^ had indicated their readiness to deal with certain points of ^ this character in an exchange of letters. Such an agreement could cover, e.g. safeguards for aerodromes ^nd seaplane bases, safeguards for wireless and other ' communications, undertakings by th« Company that they^wou:^ft 4* pay due deference to the advice of our political representatives and the views of the Sheikh, possibly (a point to be discussed later in connection with Article 12 of the revised draft Concession), exclusive British exploitation of any concession, the appointment of a British Chief Local Representative, etc. Apart from the points covered by (a) and (b), closer examination of the problem had shown that the grant of any oil concession by the Sheikh, whether to the A.P.0..C..,, the I.P.C., or an American Company, would give rise to difficult political problems in connection with jurisdiction over the concessionnaire's employees, the grant of protection by H.M.G. in cases in which local conditions made this necessary and the Sheikh for any reason failed to afford it, ana, probably, the appointment of a Political Agent to represent H.M.G. and would make it necessary to consider bringing into force certain articles of the Sheikh's Treaty of 1916 which were at present dormant. Such questions could best be dealt with in a third agreement or exchange of letters between the bheikh and H.M.G. Considerable difficulty might be anticipated in disposing of them: and if we were to take them up with the Sheikh and try to reach a general understanding with him on political points, it might be thought desirable to take the opportunity also to secure the air facilities in Qatar which the. Sheikh had hitherto refused to give save in return for guarantees of protection which H.M.G. were not prepared to undertake. Mr.Rendel said that, speaking personally, he was entirely in favour of a procedure such as had been described. Higher authority at the Foreign Office had not of course yet bem consulted. But action on these lines would, he was confident* be consistent with their general view/1 5, vievii as at present advised; which vms that, so long as the interests of rl.M.G. and of the Sheikh were adequately safeguarded nothing should be done which would tend to hamper the conclusion of an agreement between the Sheikh and the A.P.O.C; in the immediate future. Delay would inevitably increase the risk that the Standard Oil Company of California might actively interest themselves in obtaining the concession. Were they once to enter the field, they could rely on the active support of the U.S. Government, and however strong the case on merits for any special conditions which H.M.G. might be anxious to secure in respect of Britisn control, British exploitation, British local representation &amp;c., we should almost certainly find it much more difficult to have our way on such points when dealing with a wholly foreign company backed by the U .S. Government than when dealing with a company such as the Iraq Petroleum Company in which there was a substantial British element. The procedure proposed, with an important proviso which the .Foreign. Office had already recommended to the India Office, would make it possible for the A.P.0.0. to pursue negotiations immediately with the Sheikh with a view to reaching agreement on commercial points, - such an agreement to contain no clauses of a political character such as provision for jurisdiction &amp;c. While those negotiations were in progress, we could separately discuss with the Company the points to be covered in the proposed Agreement between the Company and H.M.G.: while the local political authorities, after consultation with H.M .G. and the Government of India, could press on with a settlement o± the points in issue between H.M.G. and the Sheikh. The proviso to which he had referred, and which if accepted should fully safeguard the special interests of H.M.G.., was that a clause should be inserted in any commercial agreement between, the A.P.O.C. and the Sheikh to the effect that the Agreement could. not/not come into force until trie consent of K.M.G. had been obteined to its provisions,. Such a clause merely reaffirm d the Slieikh 1 s existing treaty obligations and ought not therefore to cause difficulty with him. Vis-a-vis the Company it would emphasise the special position of H.,G. in the matter, I^Lr. he:Kiel added that in his view it would be desirable ,that the conditions to be laid down in respect of British control and exploitation of any concession^ in whatever form they might emerge as a result of discussion by higher authority, and if necessary of reference to the Cabinet, should be conditions which would apply not merely to a British concessionaire but to any other Company, of whatever nationality, which might endeavour to secure a concession in Qatar, We had not yet thought out in detail at what conditions it would be desirable to aim. the questions involved were difficult and would need careful consideration, and it might therefore be impossible at once to inform the A.P.O.G. what precisely the conditions would be. Bat so long as their general outline could be communicated, to the Company without delay, and the Company given to understand that whatever detailed conditions were finally laid down would be of universal application, it ought considerably to reduce their difficulties in negotiating either with the Sheikh or with the I,P.O. Mr. Seal said that, so far as he could judge, the Admiralty on the understandings stated by Mr• Rendel, were unlikely to object to the x :r0Ge ^ lire suggested. He thought that it was essential that the main lines of the agreement with H.M,G, should be ccrnmunicated to the Company in the. ve.ry near future, . in order to avoid any suggestion that the Company.had been allowed to proceed with the commercial agreement with the Sheikh on false px^etences: also that if any difficulty were to be experienced/experienced in getting the Sheikh to agree to oar terms it would be important to devise some means of avoiding the impression that pressure was being brought to bear upon him in the interests of the A.?.0.C„ Mr. Laithviait e said that the India Office fully agreed with the proviso to which Mr. Rendel had referred, to which they attached great importance. As regards the conditions to be laid down, he thought that it would be well to give the Company a fairly clear idea of the nature of the safeguards, etc., which His Majesty 1 s Government would be likely to require when we informed them next week of our comments on txie revised drait agreement generally. It was obviously essential that they should have this information before they concluded any agreement with the Sheikh, even if such an agreement covered commercial points only and contained the proviso which had been discussed. It would not be overlooked that the A«P.C.O. could not conclude any agreement with the Sheikh without the approval of the I.P.O. and that it might well be that safeguards such as we had in view might be of great importance from the I. P.O. standpoint, Mr . Starling said that we must take care that the minimum safeguards etc. which we might prescribe, should not be such as to be impossible for the i-.P.O.G. acting as they would be on behalf of the I. P.O. to accept. We must not overlook that, whatever the justification for therp, if the conditions laid down by H.M.G. were too stiff, the I.P.O. might be unwilling to take up, or to proceed with negotiations for, a concession, and if they were themselves unwilling to take it up a position might arise where the A.P.O.C. could not take it up independently. If that happened we might find ourselves confronted immediately with the Standard Oil of California» He drew attention to the general principles which had been laid down by the Cabinet to govern/ T) xgovern the grant of oil concessions in British territory and the conditions to be satisfied in the case of such concessions. The most important of these were: (1) Registration in British territory; (S) Majority of Employees and if possible I Managing Director to be British subjects; (3) 50fo of produce to be refined on British territory, and the oil to be suitable for Admiralty use; (4) Pre-emption in time of war. J Mr. Laithygaite pointed out that the decision in Question had had in view British territory only. Qatar was not British territory, nor a British Protectorate. It was an independent Arab State in special treaty relations with H.M.G. The view that the Cabinet decision referred to did not cover the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf, had consistently been held by the India Office in the inter departmental discussions which had taken place in connection with the Kovieit oil concession. Mr. Rendel agreed and suggested that it had been accepted at the time of the assignment to American interests of the Bahrein oil concession that oil concessions to be granted in the Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf must 'be dealt with separately and on their merits. It would be necessary to consider in the case of Q;-\tar whether the conditions laid down by the Cabinet to apply in the case of concessions in British territory or more stringent conditions, and if so what, should apply. Mr. Starling/Mr»Starlinp: . reverting to his previous remarks, enquired whether, if we so stiffened up our conditions that the I.P,C. dropped out, we should feel quite sure tha.t we could impose the same conditions on an American Company, e.g. the Standard Oil Ccmpany of California. Mr.Laithwaite said that he thought our general view was that such conditions as may be laid down should apply to any Ccmpany, whether British or foreign. The two important points were control and exploitation; and it would have to be decided what our minimum requirements in respect of them were to be. If H.M.G. decided to lay down the principle that both control and exploitation must be British, whatever might be the nationality of the Company ultimately controlling the concession, and we could secure acceptance of these terms from any concessionaire, so much the better. If it proved impossible in practice to go so far, and to secure effective British control , then we ought as a minimum to require that local representation and exploitation should be in British hands. We could make a good case for this on the ground of the special local political difficulties of Q.atar, where we should be dealing with a State with ill-defined boundaries, a backward and scattered population, hitherto little in touch with the outside world, and not easily susceptible to pressure by H.M.G. The Sheikh was precluded by his treaty engagements from dealings with foreign pov/ers - engagements to which it was regarded as desirable to hold him. If foreign subjects were massacred in Q,atar by a tribal uprising or the like, responsibility for securing effective punishment would thus fall on K.M.G. , and here as in dealing with air procedure we might reasonably take the line that while we were prepared to face certain political/J &gt; 10. political difficulties where our own nationals were concerned, we were not prepared to in the case of foreigners. Cn the face of it, too, we had a good answer to any American complaint that such conditions represented a refusal to maintain an open door policy in oil matters in the Gulf. The Trucial Coast was closed to all concession hunters, whether British or foreign. The Bahrein oil concession had already been reassigned, with our approval, to American interests; and the latest information was that in Koweit, in which .American interests had been allowed full liberty to compete, we should in future be dealing with an Anglo-American combine. Our excuse for restricting exploitation in Qatar to British personnel would be the specie.! political difficulties presented by that area. Mr . Starling said that it was relevant, so far as the nationality of exploiting personnel was concerned, that ■ Ibn Saud had agreed .that the concession granted in Hasa to the Standard Oil of California should be operated by American personnel. Mr.Rendel said that the question of nationality of the exploiting personnel and of the safeguards would clearly have to be considered separately, but frcra the Foreign Office standpoint it would be easier to impose terms in respect of these on the I.ir'.C. than on a puiely American Company, such as the Standard Oil Ccmpany. Mr.Seal said that the question of safeguards for pre-emption would probably be regarded as more important from the Admiralty standpoint if the Qatar concession were to go to a U.S. Company than if it went to the I.i.C. The fact to be faced was that the Admiralty must., have the oil in War, and %f the Company were American certain dipl cmatic difficulties might arise whiph would be very much/33 n. much more easily handled if the agreement provided for preemption. Mr.Laithwaite said that the A.P.O.C. had been warned in the meeting on 14th December that in the event of their failing to secure the concessioner of competing interests entering the fidd, H.M.G. must not be regarded as permanently committed to approval of whatever terms they might in present conditions think suitable in the case of the A. P. O.C. l r e could if necessary endeavour to make special provision in such circumstances for pre-emption, Mr.Rendel regarded it as of great importance that any conditions made by H .M .G. regarding safeguards, British control, pre-emption etc., should be of universal application. He thought that if we demanded certain conditions from the A.?.O.C.or I.P.O., but demanded different or stiffer conditions fron a purely U.S. Company, our international position would be much more difficult, since the U.S.Government would certainly accuse us of differentiation. If, on the other hand, we could work out conditions which would be applicable universally - quite ( irrespective of the nationality of the concessionary Ccmpany - and could be defended on merits in view of the political situation, our hands would be much strengthened in dealing with possible eventual representations of the U.S. or any other foreign Government. Mr.Laithwaite expressed agreement as regards the importance of making our conditions universally applicable. He asked what importance was attached to a special safeguard for refining locally ? Mr.Rendel said he had the impression that the A.P.0.C.would object to being required to refine in Q,atar. Mr.Starling suggested that they might be asked to agree to refine in Qatar or in British territory, and this was agreed. After further discussion it was agreed,subject to the approval of higher authority, (a) to accept in principle the procedure suggested at the opening of the meeting; (b) that a letter (to be concurred in by th^ Departments conoe.rued}n U 12. concerned) should be sent by the India Office toMr.Hearn in the course of next week, suggesting in the first place the adoption of the procedure which had been discussed as between the Sheikh and the Company, and the Company end secondly, recording the points on which agreement had been reached or which had been raised but not disposed of in the discussions with Mr.Fraser and Mr.Hearn on 14th 'December; thirdly, indicating in general terms the nature of the points {including safeguards &lt;&amp;c. ) which H.M.G. would desire to see covered in the proposed subsidiary agreement between the Company and themselves. It would be desirable, in dealing with this last point, not to intimate a d e c i s i on to the Canpany. The points in question were controversial and the risk apart of deterring the A.P.C.C. from proceeding with negotiations if they were stated in too categorical terms at this stage - it might be some time before H .M .G. had themselves reached decisions on them. It would probably therefore be preferable to indicate them in outline and say that a more detailed statement would follow; that we should be prepared to discuss them further with the Ccmpany if necessary later, but that in the interest of clearing the ground for their ccrnmercial negotiations with the Sheikh, we thought it undesirable to postpone communication of our comment on the draft agreement and on the question of procedure until the special desiderata of H.M.G. had. been more fully elaborated. B. Amendments in Revised Draft Concession. The meeting then considered and approved the amendments which had been provisionally agreed or raised on 14th December with Mr.Fraser and Mr.Hearn in the articles of the revised draft other than Article 12 ; and reached agreement as to the supplementary points to be raised with the A.P.O.C. on the articles in question. (These are set out in the enclosure to the draft letter to/\Jt&gt; V ^ f 4 V &gt; r . w' 1. to the Company attached), and to a satisfactory solut by io-ticle IE, the meeting concession which had been s generally suitable, /N.B.

It may be recorded that a point raised for the first time in connection with the draft Agreement which gave rise to considerable discussion was that of the definition of the Sheikh's dominions in Article 2 (c). The Southern and Western frontier of Qatar is at present somewhat indeterminate. At the same time it is important that there should be no risk of Ibn Saud being given an opportunity to call in question the line established by the unratified --nglo Turkish Convention of 29th July, 1913, i.e. a line running from the coast just cast of Uqair due South to parallel 20 North, on the Eastern boundary of Ncjd, If a map is attached to, or a definition included in, the concession, it will bo necessary either to include in or to omit from Qatar as shown on the map or in the definition the territory between the various frontiers of 'iatar as described in the Political Besident f s despatch No. 41 of 24th June, 1933, to the Colonial Office, (P.Z. 4642 /33) and the 1913 Anglo Turkish line, and this would inevitably lead to friction and controversy, particularly in view of the fact that the Standard Oil Company of California are now operating on the Hasa Coast, It was agreed therefore that it would be better to omit the map from the concession and to leave the definition as vague as possible, at any rate penaing the further report on the whole question which is awaited from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The position could be frankly explained to the A.P,0• G_*/14. C- A rticle 12 and connected cuestloria . TJie meeting then turned to consider Article 12 and the questions arising out of it. It was agreed that the se we re; (a) British control; (h) Position ana nationality of chief Local Representative; (c) Nationality of exploiting personnel; (d) Pre-emption ana refining arrangements. The aiscussion on points (h), (c) anci (d) may he briefly suiuiarised as follows:- ) Position ana nationality of Cnief ^ocal Re p r e s e n ta t i v e^ It was very important, particularly so long as there was no resident Political Officer, that he should (as in xScthrein) he a di itisn suujeco whose appointruent should he appi ovea 'oy n• xvi# kj -•, ara that ne shoulu oe persona rata to H.M.G.

Ihe Company haa suggested that it might ue easier to secure our aesiderata unaer tnis nead ii we expressed them as ^ wish rather than a demand. But the point seemed too important to leave open in this way• (c) Nationality of employees ^ The case on merits for requiring that, whatever the ultimate control ana nationality of any Company operating an oil concession in Qatar, local exploitation (and representation) shoula in present conditions be wholly British, had already been developed in the discussions above on procedure. It was agreed that a ruling would have to be sought on the difficult points it raised, pending which we could not commit ourselves to it as a sine qua non in writing to the Company: but that our letter shoula refer in general terms to the probability of such a requirement. (d)/15. (^) F re - ampt i.Qii and Lo cal ds f IninK . It was agreed that an understanding as to the right oi pre-emption in time oi war was desirable and that this should be indicated to the Company. As regards refining they should be informed that it was regarded as important that oil won should be refined either in ^atar or in British territory ana that they should be asked ^ for an assurance on this. The possibility of Karachi | was mentioned. (a) British Gonurol * The meeting consiaerea the tentative redraft of Article 12 which had been put forward by Mr. Hearn at the meeting on 14th December. Hie effect was to secure that any company to which the concession might be transferred would be a British Company, registered in Great Britain, having its principal place of business in Great Britain, and with a British subject at all times as Chairman, but to give any such company the right to form subsidiaries under its own control to work the concession which, while enjoying the rights ana accepting the obligations of the parent company under the Agreement, would be under no restriction as regards nationality or British control. It was agreed that the first paragraph of the redraft was unobjectionable so far as it went. The second, paragraph was unobjectionable if the woras 'except the engagements expressed in the final sentence of the preceding clause' were omitted. There would be no objection, if the Company thought tnis would facilitate negotiations with the Sheikh, to. leaving the question of British control out oi the commercial agreements to be negotiated between them and the/n 16. the stie ikh altogether, so long as It was agreed with the A.r .u.J. that provisions to govern it satisfactory to h.ia.G. woula he Included In the separate agreement to oe negotiated cetween H.M.G. and the Company. It was generally felt, and ^ir. starling in particular emphasised that the A.P.O.C., negotiating as toey must as agents of the I.P.G., mlgjit find considerable difficulty In accepting in respect of subslalary companies British control provisions such as were ernboQied in ivj*. hp r -ui ivj. . ac^xii io rearait oo. sub -paragraph 1 of article 12 in respect of a transferee company, m tnis connection kr. Starling considered that the British control element in any assignee or subsidiary company would not be less, and from what Mr. Praser had said on 11th Decemoer there was a prospect that it might be considerably more than that m the I.p.c, He was averse xrom asking in these conditions for a formal guarantee tnat it should be as large as possible and in no circumstances less than that in the I.P.O., and it was decided not to pursue this suggestion. Air, gtarling said that the points of real Importance to us were, he thought, local exploitation by British personnel, the rignt of pre-emption In oime oi war, and the refining of any oil won either in '^P-tar or in British territory. The representatives oi the Admiralty ana the Foreign Office suggested, lurther discussion, that even if we could persuaae the A.P.C.G. and the I.P.C.-to agree that any subsidiary company should be registered and have its principal place ol ousiness in Great Britain, and a British Chairman, the control/*T. Q 17 con oioi wiiiCii 't-iXo woulci oc? cur^ uo u.b riii^litj notj in practice prove very substantial, ana that as our -&gt; ooenticl db oj -ubxa c-a, w'b ig tiio be vvxi icn iiau dgbii nigntion6d by Mr. starling, it might be that in the long run we should lina it simplest to agree with the Company not to press the British control clause on the understanding that tney woulu meet us fully as regards our other desiderata. Mr. .tendel pointed out In particular that if we could secure our main desicierata by other means, it mi 6 ht vvcj ii bb uaci uac t ics to insist on the strict application of the British c ontrol provisions to subsidiary companies - since tnis might only further complicate the already delicate position of the A ^P .C.C. on the Board of the I.p.C. - while it would probably be possible in practice to secure by other means that subsidiary companies were under the adequate control of their parent companies. Questions connected with the registration and nationality of subsidiaries were often based on technical and financial considerations regarding taxation etc. and it did not follow that the non- application of the British control provisions to subsidiaries would in fact mean that those subsidiaries would escape from British control. It was finally agreed that in the letter to be sent to the Company our desiderata should be indicated in general terms and that a door should be left open for the Company to come back, on the ground that it would be unfortunate if, on hearing what our desiderata were, they decided that it would be useless to proceed with their negotiations, secondly that while the terms to be used would require careful consideration we might hint that rf.ivi.G. as at present advised would require British control clauses/4U • UO •18. clauses in respect ox subsidiary companies of trie nature exuuoaibd in sue-clause 1 of kt .

It has 'been decided in each case that the commercial side of the proposed concessions should he embodied in an agreement 'between tlx; Company and the Sheikh concerned, which would not come into force until parallel agreements between His Majesty's Government and the Company t concerned have been concluded. The safeguards of British interests which we require will be embodied in these Gove mm e nt agre eme nt s. The commercial agreements are already in draft, and some progress has been made in discussion of them with the Companies. I enclose copy of Article 7 in the draft commercial agreement respecting Qatar, and of Article 5 in the draft commercial agreement respecting Koweit. dioh a view to safeguarding, inter alia, the position in regard oo future requirements of air facilities, we contemplate tnaw each Government agreement should contain clauses on the following lines '5 nmander W.A.McClaughry, . o» 0», ivi.

Sir, In oonnection with the questions of granting an oil concession in Qatr to the An^lo-Persian Oil Company acting on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Go^anj, and in Koweit to a company to be equally controlled by the Anglo-Persian Oil Cuuvpany and by the Grulf Company of the U.S.A., I aia directed by the Secretary of State for Inaia to state that he has had under consideration one of the conditions to be laid down as a political safeguard in the case of either concession, namely, that the local personnel operating the concession should be either exclusively, or so far as possible, British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh concerned. 2. Sir SaFiuel Hoare attaches the highest degree of importance to this condition for well known reasons, v/hich need not be fully recapitulated. In view of the primitive conditions obtaining in the Arab principalities of the Persian G-ulf, the backward state of the administration, and the uncivilised character of the local and neighbouring populations, it is impossible to ignore the risk of unfortunate incidents or disturbances v/hich might result from the introduction of any considerable number of American or other foreign personnel of the artisan type into Qatr or Koweit, The danger of incidents would be much greater in the/ ndcr-Sccrctary of State, orcign Office, S.W.I.t.-i^ oasc of foreign cnan in the case of British 'ocrsonnGl, as the former -/oulci 00 loss amenable to the advice and instructions of the local British authorities, and at the; same time any ^ucli incident in which a foreign national suffered might give rise to international complications, as the foreign Power concerned would naturally demand that His Majesty's 'Jovernment should either take steps to enforce reparation, or permit it to intervene itself on behalf of its nationals. 0, The Secretary of Dtate therefore considers that every endeavour should be made to secure the agreement of any company seeking an oil concession in any of the Arab sheikhdoms to a condition, providing the fullest possible safeguard that the circumstances of a particular case may permit, in regard to the nationality of its local personnel. Ho does not suggest that it is necessary to impose a condition in identical terms in all cases, since circumstances may differ, and in some of the sheikhdoms the safeguard desired is of even more importance than in others. 4. It wilj be remembered that the ikmeri can-control led Bahrein Petroleum Company agreed to a condition that as many of its employees in Bahrein as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh of Bahrein, This clause does not altogether exclude the employment of American personnel, and in effect it is largely left to the Company to decide whether the employment of individual Americans is necessary for u the efficient carrying on of the undertaking'', since this is largely a technical point on which it would be difficult to dispute the Company f s opinion.I0. ihc b^cretary of State agrees with the suggestion, which has been made in inter-departmental discussions, that the various political safeguards desired in. connection with the grant of oil concessions by the Sheikhs of Qatr and Koweit should bo embodied in agreements to be concluded between His Majesty's Government and the companies concerned. Ho also agrees that it is desirable not to insist on such conditions as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the new Anglo-imerican Company in Qatr and Koweit respectively, would clearly be unable to accept. But the importance of the safeguard in regard to the nationality of local porsonncl is so great that he suggests, firstly, that we should aim at securing its embodiment in the Q^tr and Koweit agreements to the fullest extent that may be possible, ana secondly, that our minimua requirement should bo a clause following that agreed to by the Bahrein Petroleum Company slightly modified so as to provide that as many of the local employees of the Company as is consistent, in the judgment of the Company with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking shall at all times be British subjects or subjects of the Sheikh. This, it is suggested, should be the absolute minimum but every effort would bo made to induce the Companies to agree to the omission of the words in the judgment of the Company' as otherwise it might not be possible to question in any way the action of the Cumpany in regard to the number of its foreign employees. ^• Sir Sdiuuel rloare would be grateful for a very early reply to this letter. As the Secretary of State for Foreign -iffairs is aware, the matter is urgent since agreements between the Companies and the Sheikhs concerned cannot be brought into force - and ought, perhaps,, not to be finally/finally concluded - pending the conclusion of parallel agreements between the Gompanies and His Maiesty f s Gro vernment.

In any case he spoite iaore freely on Oil matters tjiar. he had done for many month s. 3 # I started the f ball rolling * by enquiring if ha had ever heard of one Mr .Abdul ohanl ^ Ad lab i of Manchester (not Ydlibi as mentioned in foreign Office letter referred to above). The Ghaikh irnmettl a tely replied that, he knew all about the person. He was a well known Syrian who had adopted European ways of living.ir^ - s - i.r..idlabi htxd large business connections In India, Sgypt ond urkey ancl had of late :/ears supplied His Majesty King n .c.ud \3 ith r.iuch o( his 'stores'' requirements, both ill tar/ snd civil arid only recently had purchased tents for his Aslr osrapali-n. -'?&gt;•! King tos under a great debt to Jfr.Adlabl, added the Shaikh, literally and metaphorically, and in order to shm his gratitude and no doubt to prevent him pr^oonting his prematurely, ^as reported to have appointed him his accredited ..gent to deal any Oil ********* can Denies, who mi^t be desirous of getting fur ther concessions in 3audi Arabia (exclusive of Hassa). On my enquiring from where he, the Shaikh, had got his information, he replied, ?, from Mohamed Tatim and quite recently 1 . This latter person, ay you kno?/, is Major Holmes* ''jackal' and visited ^/pt in December last, where I strongly suspect that he met his employer and received instructions for a new compai^pi in Kuwait. '■ j 1 next made a guarded reference to M l tar end enqulr-ed from the Shaikh how he thought the A.P.O.C* were getting on In their negotiations with .shaikh Abdulla ibn Thani. The Shaikh smillnr ly replied ttiat althou^i he did not like to state it as a 'positive fact', all news and other indications that reached him from liiath showed that Bin Gaud had definitely warned the ^haiicn of ^atar that he was not at liberty to give any sort of Oil Concession to the A.P.O.C, or other British concern, and that If he had the temerity to do so, it would be at his peril. He, the Shaikh, believed the above to be the true facts of the case, and as far as he was concerned he was quite certciin that the A«P # 0*C• would fail to get the concession they were after and that the next step would be that Bin Saud would inform the Shaikh of Qatar that he must give Oil Concession to his proteges, the standard Oil Company of Californle. (In thisthis oonnection see my despatch C-17, flated the 18th January), is Excellency then went on t o say that this unsatisfactory situation ^as entirely due to our failure to instil a of connd^noe^ into the mind of the Shaikh of H atar. The latter clearly (and the same, said the Shaikh, applied to every other Shaikh on the Arab Coast) felt today that we (Hi® Majesty 1 * Government) were a 'broken reed' and not to be railed on. ,Ve talked a great deal about the importance of treaties where they affected her own interests, but apparently were not out to remember our obligations to our friends #10 were in treaty relations with us, when string persons like Bin iLiaud , who we wanted to keep in with, exerted pressure on them. The latter had only to bully and threaten, and his victims despairing of getting any but verbal backing from us, whom they looked to for active support, naturally took the line of least re sistance, and secretly agreed with Bin Liaud to do all he asked of th©^. This, of course, entirely suited the King's policy. He did not come out into the open and so had no occasion to cross swords with His Majesty's Government. I next enquired from His Excellency how he would deal with s ^atar el* situation if he himself had the managing of lt f His reply reply was quick and to the point: 'I should immediately warn Bin ^aud that katar was entirely Independent of baud! Arabia and under my protection only; that I considered the boundary to be so and so, between the two otates, and that being the case, he. Bin baud, should be careful to see that none of his Bedouin tribes committed any acts of aggression against k,atar territory'. Bin Saud, said the Shaikh, would perfectly well understand the threat behind such letter. rt At the same time', added His Excellen cy, 'I would send a copy of my letter to the shaikh of katarf » L, Uatar and defend his comers ana then ramin no Oil Con Is ho*; I w oui^h t to t\c attitude v ?i, the iihaikb, and give hi do so quick 5. 4 BUS SAUI) ) he intended N JOTIUL) /ONS. ) concerned, there to pr* Kuweit Heutj did not thin w debouncing t and to His M, kajesty's or s tar t tri r in the Kuwall any .unarican and begin pro wo aid think o: party there. a.

He relied on His Majesty's Government to see that Bin ^aud did not do this, or start trifling in the matter. I asked him if he had anymen or retainers camped in the Kuwait Neutral -one to give him early news should any American geologists suddenly motor across its border and begin prospecting. He replied that he had none, but would think of the advisability of sending a s^ll watching party there. X veiy strongly advised him to do so. 5.

Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to tlie correspondence noted in the margin, te of discussion at F.O. on 15 Dec. ) copies ox which have already lin. to G/l.^o,114 dated 12 January ) from Res.No.T. 19 dated 11 January ) been sent from time to time 11 n No.T.34 dated 17 January ) ' to Gr/l No. 127 dated 20 January j to the Foreign Office and ' from Res.

No.98 dated 29 January ) to say that he has had under his consideration the question of the instructions to be sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in the light of the views expressed by the Government of India and / 'Colonel Fowle on this subject. 2. I sim now to enclose a memorandum giving an a-ppreciation of the various aspects of the pro Diem. Sir Samuel Hoare agrees with the conclusions reached in this memorandum, and, for the reasons more fully explained therein, would propose, subject to x-ne concurrence of mie interested Departments, 'chat tne instructions 'uo colonel Powle might be to the following effect: (a) that he should forthwith approach the Sheikh personally in regard to tne grant ox tne ^cioax oil concession to the Anglo Persian Oil Company (Iraq Petroleum C ompany) (b) that he should in the xirst place formaj-Xj xcmxnd the Sheikh (as proposed in paragraph 5 ox -oushire T. 19/ 'The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.I.&lt;0 • 1.19 of 11th January) of the provisions of Article 6 of his Treaty of 1916, and warn him (in the terms surested at the end ox paragraph 1 of the enclosed memorandum) that ne will not oe permitted to grant a concession to any company which is not at least partly British. The Secretary oi State, who is fully 8.1 iYe to the necessity for careful handling of this question with a view to avoiding diplomatic difficulties with the United States oi America, agrees with the Resident that en intimation of this nature could not be represented as a shutting of the 11 open door' in Qatar, since, as Colonel Powle points out, the Iraq Petroleum Company, to which any concession obtained by the Anglo Persian Oil Company would be immediately transferred, contains an American element. (c) that the Resident should further, in such manner as he thinks best, but in such a way as to leave no doubt in the Sheikh 1 s mind, inform the Sheikh in so many words that His Majesty's Government wish to see the concession granted to the Anglo Persian Oil Company - Iraq Petroleum Company combine. It seems probable that a definite intimation of the wishes of His Majesty's Government is more likely to secure their acceptance by the Sheikh than if there is room for any uncertainty as to what His Majesty's Government desire, or the view they would take of any failure to comply with their advice, and prima facie there would seem to be advantage in a definite intimation to the Sheikh of this nature. The Resident could at the same time make such play as is possible with the generosity of the terms which have been offered by the Anglo Persian Oil Company and might be authorised to hint, out in vague and general/general terms, at the extremeIj difficult situation which is likely to arise for the Sheikh in the event of his failing to take our advice on this question. Sir Samuel Hoare, would however deprecate any suggestion to the Sheikh that I on Baud is behind the Standard Oil Company or would desire to see the Q,atar concession granted to them, or the use of the argument that the grant of a concession to the Standard Oil of California would lead to the absorption of the Sheikh' s t err it or,/ by Ibn Baud and the disappearance of the Sheikh as an independent ruler. (d) that the Resident should be authorised to promise the Sheikh, in the event of his granting the concession to the Anglo Persian Oil Company (Iraq Petroleum Company) the grant of the full protection against aggression by land for which he asked in 1952. Sir Samuel Hoare would leave the method of approaching the Sheikh on this point to the Resident. It may we11 be that, as Colonel Powle suggests in paragraph 4 of his telegram of E6th January, the better tactics would be to lead the Sheikn himseli to raise one question of protection and then, in order to enhance the value of the undertaking proposed to be given, '' to ctssume suitable hesitation and reply that the matter must be referred to His Majesty's Government'. (e) Sir Samuel Hoare entirely agrees with the Government of India's view as expressed in their telegram over foreign subjects should oe mane an iiiuispensoDo-e pre-condition of our consent to the grant of any concessions by the Sheikh under Article 5 of his Treaty. But, in tiu? light of their views and those of Colonel Powle, ne would be prepared if necessary to await a later stage in the negotiations/■ 'O 1 ) 4. negotiations with tne Sheiidi 'before raising this question with him. The first essential is to secure the Sheikh's agreement in principle to the grant of the Qatar oil concession to the An^lo Persian Oil Company (Iraq Petroleum Company}. Once that consent has been secured, and oelore tne xinal approval ox xiis Majesty 1 s Government is given to the grant of a concession, the question of jurisdiction can be raised. Such play as is possible can then be made with the adverse financial effect on the Sheikh if Eis Majesty's Government were forced to refuse approval to the grant of a concession merely because he adopted a recalcitrant attitude regarding itj and it can be impressed upon him that a surrender of jurisdiction wi 11 be an essential prerequisite of the grant of any concession to any applicant whoe ver he may be. The same opportunity can be taken, if necessary, for considering bringing into force the dormant articles of the Sheikh 1 s treaty, of which, as the Government ox' India remark, the only one oil real importance is the appointment of a political Agent. here again, however, the Secretary of State wouxa suggest that a full discretion should be left to Colonel ihowle. Ix, lor any reason circumstances appear propitious, either in the discussions which it is now proposed tnat ne snould immediately undertake with the Sneikn or suDsequentiy, co raise any or all ox these questions, ne might oe allov»ed vO do so in such manner as he tninxs lit. 4. Copy of this letter is being sent to the Admiralty, Air Ministry and Petroleum D e par tiny n u, ana copies of j .e c bero addressed to the Admiralty and Air Ministry are enclosed. In/3 mORANDIJIvL It seems clear in the first place that the polio leal ailiiculties wiiich niight arise froiu the grant of a concession in respect of c^atar to any conipany which is not at least partly British, ano. from Milch the lequioite sc^ieguaicis for Briuish political interests cannou oe ohtainecl, are likely to oe extremely serious* It is now accepted that 'one maintenance of the special British position on the Arab littoral of the Gulf is of ^cardinal imp ortance, a fact which has 'been further stressed in recent months by the rapid developments of air communication - likely to aevelop still more rapidly in the future - ana by the possibility that HJvuG, may be unable to retain their naval station at Henjam. The Sheikhdom of Qatar is of particular importance because of its geographical position on the southern littoral of the Persian Gulf. The establishment of a non-British oil company in Qatar, particularly if identical or closely associated with the American company to which Ibn Saud has granted the Hasa concession, must inevitably sooner or later react unfavourably on the position of H.M.G. in the vitally important Sheikhdom of Bahrein. It will equally inevitably prejudice in an increasing degree as time goes on the position of H.M.G. in trie semi-barbarous areas of the Trucial Coast.. H,M*G* have in the past, as a deliberate policy, abstained from interference or the exercise of influence in the internal affairs and in the hinterland of those areas. With the rapid development of air communication, ana the possibility of pressure hy oil interests to obtain concessions, that policy may before very long require reconsideration: and it is essential that in dealing with Qatar nothing should he done which might/might plecy H.ivi.in a w69.k6r positjion 'to sbcutg 'their desiderata in that event. It is unnecessary to develop the^local political difficulties likely to arise in the case of Qatar itself should any concession he locally exploited save by British personnel, or he under non- British c ontrol. In these circumstances the course I , suggested in paragraph 5 of the Political Resident 1 s ..telegram T.19 seems the right one to adopt. The wording ' /c&gt; \y 4 to he used hy Colonel Powle in his discussion with the Sheikh might he that 'H.M.G., having regard to their special treaty relations with the sheikh, would not he prepared to agree to the grant of a concession hy him of any kind in respect of Qatar to a company which was not at least partly British'. 2. Ihn 3aud and the Qatar concession . This raises an important question of policy . The ■Resident and the Government of India have drawn attention to the possibility that Ton 3aud may endeavour to support the efforts of the Standard Oil Company to secure the Qatar concession with a view to himself 'absorbing' Qatar; and to the risks involved in any attempt by Ibn Saud to grant 'protection' in the hinterland to any oil coneessionnaire in Qatar. Reference is invited to 1%? Colonel Fowls's telegram No. 98 of 29th January as regards the reports of Ibn Saud f s attitude on these points. They appear, however, to be largely derived from local rumours the basis for which is to some degree uncertain. Be that as it may, Ibn Saud, by Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda of 1927, has undertaken to respect the special treaty relations of H.Ivi.G. with the Sheikh of Qatar, my attempt on his part to 'absorb' the Qatar Sheikhdom would be wholly inconsistent with the provisions of the Treaty in question/1 \}' I &gt;~ O a question, ana prima lacie it vvoula seem very ciout)tful vJi^oh01 ion oL-.ua woula, unless some quite radical change uaKcs place in the general situation, ds disposed to iacc tne very serious conseQuences of the breach with n.ivi.j. which a I lag rant disregard of his treaty obllgauions woula involve, in these circunistances it aoc-s not seem necessary to regard very seriouslv the prohadility of a formal attempt at absorption. 5. The possioility of an attempt 'by Ion Saud to grant protection' to an oil concessionnaire in the hinterland of Qatar is to some extent connected with the difficult Question of what eastern limits H.M,G. recognise to Ihn Spud's authority. The question of the boundaries of Qatar Is oeing dealt witn in a separate Note. But it appears probable that the Sheikh recognises as his western and southern boundary line a line running south- south-east across the base of the Qatar peninsula from a point about 13 miles north of Doha t - a s - 3a 1 wa to a point some 10 or 12 miles north of the Khor-al-Odeid. Ton Saud's eastern boundary has not formally been defined in any Treaty engagement with K.M.G. But the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjaq of Nejd as constituted by the Blue Line of the unratified Anglo-Turkish convention of 1913 lies well to the west of the boundary of Qatar suggested above by the Sheikh. While it is common knowledge that Ibn 3aua exercises a strong and even preponderant influence of an unofficial character to the east of the Blue Line, possibly so far to the east as the Bareimi Oasis, it is suggested that any effort on his P^rt to exert or extend an officlal influence or formally to grant protection east of that line to oil companies oi others, should be strongly resisted, and that if the question/question arises Ton Sauci regard the Blue Line as this involves considerat H.M.G-# that the western west as the Blue Line. is approved it should at deal with any effort on 'protection' in the hint* Blue Line to any oil con 4.

If the adoption of this attitude is approved it should afford a firm oasis on which to deal with any effort on the part of Ibn 3aud to grant 'protection' in the hinterland of ^a,tar and East of the Blue Line to any oil concessionnaires. 4. The Krant of protection to trie oheikh against ~ agression by lend . The question will, however, be of less importance if are prepared to accept responsibility for the defence of Qatar against landward aggx'ession. (Compare in this connection 3ir Hugh Biscoe's Despatch No.371-3 of 7th June 1932 (P^Z.35.20/32), and Oiptain Prior's Report No.C.loO dated 20th August 1932 enclosed in Bushire Despatch 611-3 of 26th August 1932 (p.Z.5451/32). It is for the Air Ministry to say whether they would anticipate any difficulty in granting the necessary protection were H.M.G. to approve its grant in principle. It is for them also to give such estimate as may be possible of the probable financial burden of granting such protection. Such information as is available about the area lying in the hinterland of Qatar suggests that it is populated by migratory Bedouin tribes who pay an informal and vague allegiance to Ibn Saud, but who, for the most part, are for practical purposes independent. Were the sheikhdom of a.tar a rich and fertile area with good grazing grounds, there might perhaps be a greater risk of frequent raiding from the desert area. But so far as we are aware, this is not the case and the principal inducement to raiders would be such plunder as could be secured from the raiding of/of settlements established in connection with oil operations, or such blackmail as coula be levied on the oil concessionnaire or the Sheikh as the price of non interference. sis will be seen, neither the Political Resident nor the Government of India, who have long experience of this quarter, appear to regard the grant of protection in present circumstances as involving very • serious commitments^ The Air Council, whose officers have first-hand personal experience of the Q^tar Peninsula, may be able to throw further light on this point, subject, however, to any view which may be expressed by them, there seems a strong case for the acceptance of liability for protection (since whoever obtained an oil concession in Qatar an indirect liability would fall on H.M.G.), and for using to the utmost the very substantial reassurance which this should represent to the sheikh to persuade him to grant an oil concession to the A.P.O.G. The grant of protection would not absolve tne Sheikh from taking his own measures so far as possible to defend his principality, but it would cover any unprovoked aggression across his southern boundary. If that southern boundary is, at any rate as a temporary measure, fixed at the point v/hich the Sheikh himself at present apparently contemplates, such protection will be necessary against the nomad tribes of the desert. If, for any reason (and it might well be necessary to consider this) it proved necessary to claim that Qatar influence or Qatar territory extended so far to the west as the blue line, there would still be a danger of incursions from the desert area to the south; the population of nomad Bedouin using a Sheikhdom with such boundaries would be substantially increased, and to that extent the undertaking/c O . undertaking of a larger commitment woula 'be involved. On the other hand it woula de possible, ii the boundaries of C^atar .and ^ajd marchea, equally to require the Saudi Government, 30 long at any rate as that Government remains in effective control of Kasa and Nejd, to control any r^ias loy tribes permanently settled in their territory across tue bouiiciary o± ^aucii AraDia. 4 j I i 1' i.

Oux gbxiord \ i ew v/ould De that the Question of any reconnaissjxnce o /er ■ o ar should be left until the Question of protection has been broscned .• Particularly if it is broached oy the oneilch, tne Resident will be in a position to take the i line that, while the matter must be referred to His Majesty's GoverniJient uhey will obviously be anxious in the first place to ascertain what difficulties are involved in the grant of protection, and for this purpose it woulo^be possible for him to obtain the consent of the Sheikh to reconnaissance flights of the nature which you suggest. As the result of these reconnaissance flights, which need not, I imagine, take very long, it would presumably be possible for the Air Ministry to reach final conclusions without delay as to the landing grounds which they would require in the event of a guarantee of protection being given. The connected question of intelligence is one for settlement between the departments concerned in consultation with the Political Resident, and is not of immediate urgency, 6. On the points to which you refer in paragraph 5 of your letter, I may say that in the event of our entering into closer relations with the Sheikh of -^atar consequent on the grant of an oil concession by him, we should, as at present- advised, proposed to aim at securing that the air procedure which h^sbeen agreed with the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office in the case of Bahrein, Koweit ana Muscat should equally apply to Qatar - in ooher words, that there shoul^ be a formal agreement with the Sheikh covering civil aviation (ana providing for the payment to him of a certain rent in respect of such civil aviation facilities as might be provided), accompanied by a binding exchangeof letters in regard to the activities of military aircraft. This would cover point (a) in paragraph 5 of your letter so far as aerodromes were concerned, and the conditions under which military aircraft could fly over the principality as a whole could be worked out 'between us eaad the Resident with a view to proposals Do the Sheiich on this subject also 'being considered. 7. Point (b) in the same paragraph is closely connected with the question of protection. If the Sheiich is offered and accepts our protection we assume that no difficulty would arise about the provision of refuelling facilities. Detailed arrangements in regard to the provision of labour for the making or improvement of landing grounds coula 'be a matter for local agreement. A guarantee for their safety would be covered by the agreement referred to in the preceding paragraph. The question of what, if any, payment would 'be necessary, is one on which we should .in due course like the xiesiaent's advice. He would no doubt consult Air Officer Commanding Iraq in connection with it. 8. The question raised in paragraph 5 (c) can be considered in due course. It is not a matter of immediate importance. 9. as regards paragraph 5 (d) of your letter, the draft Concession contains no provision for the use of independent air facilities by the oil concessionnaire. If we can secure an agreement with the Sheiich on the same lines as we propose in Bahrein, Xoweit and Muscat, it will secure in practice complete control to His Ma jesby 1 s Government of any air facilities, and if the Company should ever wish to establish a landing ground of their own, a condition such as you suggest oould fee considered as a term of approval to it. ./e think it unnecessary to take up the point now. 10.

T • The Southern Boundary of Qatar and the Connected Problems. The question for settlement is that of the boundaries of the Sheikhdom of Qatar where it is not bounded by the sea. In the pre-war period the boundary to the south 'was to some extent indeterminate, but broadly speaking was regarded at the time of the compilation of Lorimer's Gazetteer in 1905-07 as running across the base of the L ™\ TI ? Qatar Peninsula more or less south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa to a point north of 15()6 ' Khor-al-Odeid. There is reason to believe that the Sheikh of Qatar still regards it as following approximately this line (see paragraph 8 below), but conditions have not been propitious for raising the question specifically with him, and the present note aims at reaching a provisional conclusion on the material available as to—■ (a) the southern boundary of Qatar ; (b) if the boundaries of Qatar on the south and west do not extend to the blue line agreed as the eastern frontier of N'ejd in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913, the position of the intervening area. The history of the question is as follows :— The Boundary on the South-East, 2. To the east, the boundary between Qatar and the adjoining Trucial Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi has been the subject of frequent dispute in the past. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has claimed sovereignty over a stretch of Qatar territory running so far Lor. II, 405. north as the Bay of Umm-al-Hul, south of Wakra on the map attached.* The Sheikh of Qatar, for his part, has claimed sovereignty over areas in the Abu Dhabi Sheikhdom running as far east as the Sabakhat Matti. His Majesty's Government Lor. II, 88- .have consistently refused to recognise claims so exaggerated by either party, but they b9 - have repeatedly intimated that they regard the Khor-al-Odeid, which lies about mid way between the extreme points referred to, as appertaining to Abu Dhabi. They have Lor. II, 89. also recognised the Abu Dhabi claim to the district of Aqal, geographical details of w T hich are given in I (iii) of the Appendix to this note, and which contains both the '■Khor-al-Odeid and the Khor-adh-Dhuwaihin. We have thus a fixed point for the south-eastern boundary of Qatar. The Boundary on the South-West. 3. On the south-western extremity of the Qatar boundary there has been no corresponding dispute, nor is there a fixed point equally definitely established which can with confidence be regarded as marking the western limit of the tei ritories of Qatar. The Position prior to the A nglo -Turkish Convention of 1913. 4. The southern boundary of Qatar was closely investigated locally between 1904 and 1907 by experienced political officers in connection with the compilation of Mr. Lorimer's 'Persian Gulf Gazetteer.' The result of their investigation is given in the extract from the Gazetteer reproduced as item I (i) m the Appendix to this note. Broadly speaking, it went to show that the southern boundary of the btate ran south-east from liohat-as-Salwa to a point to the north of the Ahor-al-U en . Over the first section, running Irom Dohat-as-Salwa to the Wells of ^akak, there was no dispute. The boundary between the Wells of Sakak and the sea on the eastern side of the Qatar Peninsula was, however, indeterminate. Two alternatives (the difference at its widest point being some 20 miles) were reported by Loiimer. _ oi the reasons given by him (and substantially based on the historical considerations referred to in paragraph 2 above) he regarded the second alternative as preferable. The effect of its acceptance would be that the eastern sector of the southern Qatar boundary would run south-east from the Wells of Sakak to the bea noiti o tie Khor-al-Odeid. * Not reproduced. 2560 12 2.34p.z. 299/34. p.z. 180/34. Bnsliire Memo. 947 S. of 20th Dec. 1922. P.Z. 4642/ 33. The A nglo -Turkish Convention of July 1913. 5. Discussion over the years 1911-13, between the Turkish Goverumeut and His Majesty's Government on the various matters in dispute between them in the Persian Gulf area culminated in the latter year in the signature of two Convention defining inter alia the eastern limits of Turkish authority in Arabia. The Convent i of 29th July 1913, which defined the eastern boundary of Nejd, is alone relevant for the present purpose. Under that Convention, which, though reference is made to it in the ratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 9th March 1914, was never itself ratified, the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjaq of Nf-jd was defined by a blue line on the map running due south from the head of tho bay opposite Zaqnuniyeh Island in the Persian Gulf to the 20th parallel of latitude in the Central Arabian Desert. The text of the relevant article is given in section 11 of the Appendix attached to this Note. Its wording (' une ligne . . . separera le Xedjd de la presqu'ile d'El Katr. Les limites du Nedjd sont indiquees par une ligne bleue . . . ') would justify the contention that the blue line was at once the eastern frontier of Xejd and the western frontier of Qatar. But there are definite objections to adopting this view. In the first place, there is nothing to show that this was, in fact, the intention of His Majesty's Government at the time when the Convention was concluded, or that they had any object beyond limiting the eastern boundary of the Turkish possessions in this area. Secondly, there is no evidence of any claim to suzerainty by Qatar so far to the west or so far to the south. Thirdly, the Resident's telegram of 11th January 1934, T. 19, emphasises the absence of control by the Sheikh of Qatar over the interior of his State (and a fortiori over regions so remote from Dohah as are now under consideration). Fourthly (though this by itself is probably not of serious importance) the position vis-a-vis Ibn Saud is to some extent compromised, as explained below, at any rate as regards the Barr-al-Qarah, by the line fixed by Sir Percy Cox in 1922. fifthly, it is arguable that even in a formal document such as the 1913 Convention, the fact that the blue line is spoken of separating Nejd from the Qatar Peninsula, need not be regarded as determining the boundary of Qatar. The Qatar Peninsula was the closest prominent geographical feature and the nearest adjoining Arab political entity on the mainland, and a reference to it for descriptive purposes was not unnatural. Finally, there is much to be said for giving no avoidable extensions to the boundaries of Qatar, even if the consequence is that we have, to deal with an area of indeterminate ownership between those boundaries and the blue line. Line hsdicated in 1922 by Sir P. Cox to Ibn Saud and Major Holmes as the Eastern Limit of any Oil Concession in respect of Hasa. 6. One more incident of importance should be recorded before coming to the latest evidence as to the view held by the Sheikh of Qatar as to his southern r ^ le ^ nc ^ent is that reported in Colonel Dickson's letter of 4th July t &gt; i* • i ' t ^ ^ olitical Resident, copies of which were received under the Political Resident's express letter of 18th December 1933, No. 1934 S.; when 1 - t \ e T T y o 0X 'i^ lf ? n Commissioner for Iraq, in a discussion at Oqair in 1922 at • tti ^ , Sultan of Nejd, and Major Holmes, warned both the Sultan am. i ajoi Holmes that the Sultan could grant no concession, and Major Holmes receive none from him in respect of the Principality of Qatar, and drew on a map a me running rom Djau-ed-Dukhan to Dohat-as-Salwa, which, he indicated, must represent the eastern boundary of any concession granted by Ibn Saud in respect p • aSa i 7 &gt;UC l l . a l 1 ®' a ® Wl11 be seen from map, excludes the whole Qatar nf X A IT iBGid en tally a substantial area lying to the west of the blue line bb!p lil ^'' a 1 1 C ° nV ? nt l 01 ^ lt a ?so includes in Hasa an area to the east of the it constitntprl % urkish Convention.

It would equally give a very substantial extension to the boundaries of Qatar an extension of ranch more practical importance now than in 1922, when there was no question of active exploitation of the hinterland, and our concern was chiefly to .naintain the independence of the sheikhdoms of the Arab littoral against Ibn Sand. The statement is, no doubt, an alternative version of Sir P. Cox's warning to Ibn Sand as to the eastern boundary of any concession to be granted by him in respect of Hasa discussed in the preceding paragraph, of which an authoritative record based on personal knowledge is given in Colonel Dickson's letter of 4th July 1933, No. 143. I.P.C. Map of February-March 1933. 8. The map compiled by the I.P.C. geologists during their survey in Qatar in February -March 1933 marks a southern boundary line starting on the sea-coast immediately south of Jabul-el-Naksh about 10 miles north of Salwa town and 12 miles north of the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, turning abruptly to the south- sduth-east immediately south-east of Jabul-el-Naksh for a distance of some 12 miles to Qalat-ali-Bin-Said, and thence running due east, leaving Tuair-al-Hamir on its left, through the Wadi-al-Ghurban to the sea, which it apparently reaches at a point some 8 miles north of the outlet of the Khor-al-Odeid inlet and not very far into the Niqayan Sandhills. The A.P.O.C., in communicating a copy of this map, remarked : ' The dotted line boundary to the south of Qatar is apparently the Sheikh's version of the line. The I.P.C. report, however, is not definite about this.' The A.P.O.C. have since reported that, according to one member (Haji A. F. Williamson) of the geological party which visited Qatar in February and March 1933, the southern boundary shown on their map was indicated by the Sheikh himself. If the line in fact represents his view, the boundary, as will be seen, will correspond very closely to the pre-war line recorded by Lorimer. ) ■ P.Z. 456/34. * li I Conclusions as to the Southern Boundary of Qatar. 9: It is suggested, in the light of the evidence collected above — (а) that the south-eastern boundary of Qatar must lie to the north of the Khor-al-Odeid and the district of Aqal; (б) that while His Majesty's Government had at no stage formally recognised any specific southern boundary to Qatar (save to the extent referred to in (a)), such evidence as is available goes to show that the pre-war boundary ran roughly south-east across the base of the Peninsula, from Dohat-as-Salwa, or a point slightly north of it, to a point north of the Khor-al-Odeid. There is no recorded evidence of any more extensive claims by the Sheikh of Qatar other than those to Abu Dhabi temtory referred to in paragraph 2 above ; (c) in the light of the above, that, if it proves that the Sheikh of Qatar now regards the line shown on the I.P.O. map as Ins southern boundary, this may be accepted by His Majesty s Oovernment as geneially satisfactory. Acceptance of that line, if we continue to regard the blue line of the 1913 Convention as the eastern boundary of Ibn Sand's territories (or even if we were to agree to the attubution of the Barr-al Qarah district lying east of the blue line to Hasa (see paragraph 18 below)) will admittedly leave an area of undetermined ownership between Qatar and Neid. The problems involved in this are discussed in greater detail in paragraphs 10 and following. If, however. His Majesty s Government are prepared to face them, the boundary in question has the merits that it is consistent with the obligations we have undertaken to Abu Dhabi; it is equally consistent with the maintenance ot the blue line of the i913 Convention as against Ibn Saud (or with such a moditi- cation of that line as is referred to in paragraph 19 (c) (i) below; and it has the advantage of definitely limiting the area of any commitments in respect of protection, &amp;c., into which His Majesty s Government may think st desirable to enter in the event of an oil concession being granted by the Sheikh. v i ■ nXBBBBBBB 3W Position of Area lying between Base of Qatar Peninsula and Blue Line of Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. 10 If in these circumstances, it is accepted that the southern boundary of Qatar should be a line running via or to the north of Sakak more or less south-east fmn I )ohat -as -Salwa or a point slightly to the north of Do.iat-as-Salwa to a point to ^ north of the Khor-al-Odeid, the difficult question arises ot the position ol the country lying between such a line and the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. Importance of Maintaining the Blue Line. 11. On the one hand, it appears definitely important if possible to maintain the blue line laid down in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as against Ibn Saud or any other future ruler of this part of Arabia.. While the 1913 Convention was never ratified, the blue line at any rate represents the agreement reached at the time between Turkey and His Majesty's Government as to the limits of Turkish authority in northern Arabia and on the Persian Gulf, and in dealing with Ibn Sand as the successor in title to the Turks we can, it would seem, not unreasonably take our stand on it. The difficulties of finding any satisfactory substitute are patent. The undesirability of giving Ibn Saud, in the absence of any definite eastern boundary to his territories, an excuse for territorial expansion (as distinct from the exercise, as at present, of an informal influence and the receipt from our Arab clients of payments which we do not recognise and the existence of which we ignore) in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast and of Muscat is equally clear. Such expansion would clearly involve a risk either of his coming into conflict with the local rulers, whose treaty relations with His Majesty's Government he has formally lecognised, or of -his establishing an influence in the Sheikhdoms in question so powerful as to be embarrassing from our point of view. It is relevant, finally, that confidential infor mation suggests that Ibn Sand does nothimself at the moment seriously question the blue line. Disadvantages of Maintenance of the Blue Line while fixing Southern Boundary of Qatar at the Base of the Qatar Peninsula. 12. At the same time, important on general grounds, for the reasons given, as the maintenance of the blue line appears to be, the fact must be faced, that in the present case, if we continue to regard it as the eastern boundary of Ibn Saud's territory, and if, as suggested, we accept a southern boundary lor Qatar running roughly across the base of the Qatar Peninsula, a not inconsiderable area lying between the two States, and peopled by migratory Bedouin tribes, will be left in an indeterminate political position. There is a possibility that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who lias in the past exercised a wide influence, and made tribal alliances of his own, in the prucial hinterland — cf. Sir P. Cox's letter No. 176 of 28th June 1904—might prefer some claim to such an area. But, though on this point further information will be sought from the Resident, there seems little evidence of any active interest on the part of Ahu Dhabi in any area to the west of Aqal. Assuming that no such claim exists, or could be substantiated, the alternatives are to recognise the area as belonging to Ibn Saud ; to recognise it as belonging to the Sheikh of Qatar ; or to regard it as a political no-man's land. 13. If we recognised it as belonging to Ihn Saud we Could, if necessary, call upon him to keep Bedouin raids into Qatar from it under control. But such recognition would not merely be inconsistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the 1913 Convention, to the abandonment of which, as stated above, the objections appear to be stiong, but would represent a formal acceptance of Saudi sovereignty to the borders oi Qatar and Abu Dhabi which might well prove embarrassing. . l 4 ' , If ; on the other baud, it is attributed to tbe Sheikh of Qatar, we should be justified m expecting the full co-operation of the Sheikh in dealing with Bedouin activities within its limits. But such an attribution would not meiely'to give lo Qatar a substantial area which she does not in the past appear to have claimed, but would extend ie imits of any liability for protection which we may undertake in coimection with the grant of an 01 concession. It might be necessary to claim the area {or at any rate its coastal strip) for Qatar if there were serious signs of foreign m erest in it or of an intention on the part of Ibn Saud to occupy it But pending such assaasr: s'r'-——• •»&lt;''— s —5 ; 15 - The decision to regard it as a political would, so far as can be judged, be likely to mean little more than the acceptance of the de facto position to-day As will be seen from paragraphs 16 to 18 below, the area, save for the Barr-al-Qarah district is largely desert, peopled by nomadic tribes yielding uncertain ^aUegiance to Ibn Sand, and it appears to differ little in general conditions from the Jtub-al-Khah further south. Admittedly the absence of a limitrophe ruler who could be made responsible for the activities of his subjects, may make it more difficult to secure the southern border of Qatar against nomadic Bedouins. But the difficulties involved may be less than they appear. The difficulties of any alternative to regarding the tract as of indeterminate ownership are great, and at any rate as a provisional policy there would appear to be much to be said for treating this area as indeterminate m ownership and avoiding, if possible, raising the thorny questions of its boundaries to the west and of political control within it with Ibn Sand. Nature and Political Conditions of the Indeterminate Area. ^ 16. Before reaching a conclusion it may be well to place on record such scanty information as is available about the nature and the political conditions of the indeterminate area. Apart from the coastal district known as the Barr-al-Qarah, which is further discussed in paragraph 18 below, the bulk of it appears to belong to the Jafurah desert, which Lonmer describes as an area 'possessing only a few wells of very bitter water, a little scanty grazing, with a surface of red and burning I-' 01 '* II) 892— sand,' in which living conditions are extremely difficult and which is frequented 3 ' 41 to any considerable extent' only by 'the hardy A1 Morrah, and even they avoid entering it unless in winter or in search of a refuge from more powerful enemies ' (cf. Appendix, section I (vi)_). Since the date of Lorimer's Gazetteer, Mr. Bertram Thomas, on his recent crossing of the Rub-al-Khali, has passed through this area from south to north, travelling from the well of Banaiyan near Latitude 23° ll' 40' via Haluwain, Nakhala, and the western extremity of a salt lake Ijdng immediately west of the Khor-al-Odeid, across the pre-war Qatar frontier to Dohah. His account is of importance because it makes it clear that such local control as is exercised is exercised solely by nomad Bedouin tribes (and principally the A1 Murra, who are a tribe dwelling in the sands, whose influence extends well down into the Rub-al-Khali). Secondly, even though he travelled with a 'rabia,' or guarantor, from the A1 Murra Arabia tribe, the journey was rendered extremely dangerous by the risk of an attack on the Felix, party by Ikhwan fanatics, who roam apparently at large, over the whole area. 2 1 6 - 7 ' 281 Thirdly, the sites of Salwa, Iskak (? —Sakak) and Mabak, the first two of which lie on, Arabia and the third slightly south of, the pre-war boundary of Qatar, were at the time of ^ 0 ^ his journey in the hands of the Ikhwan, with the result that he could not visit them, footnote, 17. On the question of political conditions Mr. Thomas throughout his journey (the route of which lay well to the east of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention) from the centre of the Rub-al-Khali northwards to the Persian Gulf refers to the established influence of Ibn Sand and its beneficent results, and remarks: ' To-day peace, the peace of Bin Saud, prevails throughout the sands. Arabia The influence of the Ruler of Central Arabia, wielded through his able Viceroy at pefix^ Hofuf, Ibn Jiluwi, compels peace between all these old enemies, not through direct pp. 271-2. control, for there is and can be none, but through the immense personal prestige of Abdul Aziz himself. A belief in his strength and star has swept across the sands. Not love, but awe, serves this wise providence that so directs affairs. . . . Thus, the sand tribes proper are in some degree leagued with Bin Saud. ihey pay to him a nominal tribute and by that act are ensured mutual protection one from the other. In theory the tribute is an annual levy of one dollar on each camel. In practice, the Rashid have no money, and in any event they escape proper payment by reason of their remoteness. They do, however, send a camel from year to year as occasion offers in token of submission. When, however, rains fall in the northern sands and they migrate thither, the tax-gatherers' demands must be met, and a few camels are sold for the purpose. Light as is the bond, the tribes grumble at it. . . . They all swear that the existing peace shall last only as long as the present regime of Riyadh. Let Riyadh or Hofuf be thought to have lost its power, and raiding will be resumed immediately, and blood will flow again. ...' Mr. Thomas's remarks may be compared with those of Mr. Philby (who in 1932 travelled through the Lan-al-Qarah area and thence south-west to the Jabrin oasis) reproduced in section HI of the Appendix to this Note. 2560 A 2b T he B arr-al -Q araii D istrict. 18 The importance of this district for the present purpose is first that it embraces the coastal strip lying between the bine line and the pre-war western extrem.ty of Oitar and secondly that it appears to correspond ianly closelv, if not exactly, with the triangle oHand lying to the east of the bine line, which falls withm the area left ^ to the west of the rough ime indicted to Ibn Sa^d and Major Holmes 33 Sir I Cox in W22 Csee paragraph 6 above). Mr. Phdby, with the assrstance of recommendations and guides furnished by Ibn Jilnwi, the Saudi Governor o£ Hasa, travelled through a portion of it in 1932. The impression left by ins hmpty Quarter is that the dominant political influence at the present day are the Saudi Government aud the Ikhwan Details of the Barr-al-Qarah district are given in the extract from Lornner reproduced as item I (v) in the Appendix to this Kote. As will be seen Lor.mer considered that it 'might perhaps be reckoned as included in the banjaq ot La&amp;a in other words, in the pre-war Ottoman Sandjaq of Nejd. On tins assumption the boundaries of Nejd in the 1913 Convention might well have been fixed so as to include it, with the result that the limits of Nejd would have touched the pre-war- limits of Qatar on the coastline at the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, the hinterland (actually the Jafurah Desert) being left in indeterminate ownership. For whatever reason (and it must be assumed that substantial justification was produced to persuade the Turks to relinquish their position in the Barr-al-Qarah) the line was in fact fixed farther to the west. But the history of the Barr-al-Qarah, and the fact that the 1913 Convention had never been ratified, may well have been the reasons which led Sir P. Cox in 1922 to fix the limits of Hasa at a point which included in it the Barr-al-Qarah rather than at the blue line of the 1913 Convention. Conclusions. 19. In the light of the examination of the position given above, and subject to the observations of the Government of India and the Political Resident, tne best coarse would appear to be the following:— (a) Boundaries of Qatar. —To agree that the boundaries of Qatar shall be accepted as being on the north, east and west, the sea ; on the south, a line running across the base of the Peninsula from a point not south of the latitude of the h'ead of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay to a point not south of the north side of the Khor-al-Odeid inlet. The line indicated on the l.P.C. map would satisfy these criteria, and if it is confirmed that it is the line at present claimed by the Sheikh of Qatar it could be accepted. A slight modification to bring the line some 12 miles south to the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, and so to reduce the area of sea coast in indeterminate ownership, could be considered if necessary. ..(h) The hlue line of the 1913 Convention, to be maintained as against Ibn Sand, for the reasons given in paragraph 11 above, as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia. (c) If a claim is advanced by Ibn Sand to the Barr-al-Qarah on the ground of the line indicated by Sir Percy Cox in the Oqair conversations in 1922, referred to in paragraph 6, that His Majesty's Government should either— (i) concede the claim, on the ground, if necessary, that they regarded themselves as committed by the informal conversations of 1922, but without prejudice to the maintenance in principle of the blue line, and in return for a formal recognition by Ibn Saud of the validity of this line. Ihe attribution to Ibn Saud of the Barr-al-Qarah area, undesirable as it may be on other grounds, would have the advantage of leaving no gap of indeteiminate territory bordering on the sea coast, for we can without difficulty, as suggested in (a) above, recognise the frontiers of Qatar as beginning at Dohat-as-Salwa, i.e. at the point at which the Barr-al -Qarah ends. (ii) If it ^ as thought preferable to make no concession in respect of iq I jo ^ e V^ 0a 1:0 ar o Lie that informal discussions such as those of ( x wmch had never been confirmed in writing or been the subject ot tormal agreement, had no binding effect, and that His Majesty's Government rook their stand on the blue line. Play might be made with the tact that the line drawn by Sir Percy Cox would, in fact, deprive Ibn •i ? iT a substantial area lying between Djau-al-Dukhan and the western side of the blue line.Has (d) The area lying between the blue line and the boundaries reccanisod' for' Qatar :'c\ ( ri1o o 7h suh hi to % Dhabi, as of ^determinate *? ^ Btr^Qa ^Ihe Hl en ^ ^ {m ^ coastal stdp Jtte Wan al yarah, the likelihood that oil companies will aetively interest themselves in it is probably small, if they do, on the principle that Tfan Sand has no interest east of the blue line, it might be necessary to consider whether to attribn e it to Qatar or Abu Dhabi (the wording of the 1913 Convention, as quoted in paragraph 5 above, would assist us fn claiming it for Qatar). It would in any event be desirable, in order to prevent fore', interests from endeavouring to establish a foothold in it, to consider in what way it could best be made clear that we regarded it as falling within o r own sphere of influence or that ^aiie^our Trucial allies. &lt; e ) When once oil operations have stlS^^atar ^l^cjjvey a warning through ^ the Sheikh of Qatar, if wWcircumstances ti make thifnoocoin^C^ to the migratory Bedouin tribes who use the area referred to in ((/) that in the event of their crossing, with hostile intent or save for normal peaceful pursuits, such as grazing, such line as may be fixed as the boundary of Qatar they will do so at their own peril. The local political authorities would no doubt be able to ascertain and to advise what customary rights in respect of grazing, &amp;c. these migratory tribes at present enjoy within Qatar proper. On the question whether any corresponding intimation should be made to Ibn Saud in respect of tribes permanently belonging to Nejd but using the mdeteimmate area it seems definitely preferable, in the interest of avoiding discussion with him of the position of the indeterminate area and of the blue line, to make no communication unless and until circumstances India Office, / J.

(i) Qatar. {N^B.—Mr. Lorimer's article on Qatar is stated to be the result of special enquiries made over a number of years locally.) Lorimer, Vol. II, page 1506, defines the boundaries of Qatar as follows ;— ' On the east, north and west, Qatar is surrounded by the sea. The southern boundary is somewhat indeterminate. It begins at the foot of Dohat-as-Salwa on the western side of the promontory, and from that point runs south-eastwards to the wells of Sakak. Thence, according to one account, it strikes east-north east to the north end of the Naqiyan sandhills, or, according to another, east by south to the southern end of the same hills on the north side of the entrance to is leii $ ins Khor-al-Odaid. As the territory of the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has never clearly been asserted to extend beyond Khor-al-Odaid, and as the Al-Tbani Sheikhs of Qatar undoubtedly claim the Naqiyan tract, the latter of the two alternative lines is to be preferred ; the British Government have recognised Khor-al-Odaid as belonging to Abu Dhabi and the boundary consequently cannot be placed nearer to Trucial Oman, though the Al-Thani Sheikhs assert a right to the whole coast as far as the Sabakhat Matti. It is said that three men stationed at Dohat-as-Salwa, Sakak and Niqa-al-Maharah, respectively, can watch the whole southern border of Qatar from sea to sea.'(ii) Khor-al-Odaid. In Vol II on page 1367, Mr. Lorimer describes Khor-ahOdaid as ' an inlet or creek on the coast of the Abu Dhabi principality as its extreme western end. It lies about 180 miles almost due west from the town of Abu Dhabi. The boundary of Qatar is either at, or a short distance to, the north of the inlet. (iii) Aqal. In Vol. II, pages 88-89, Mr. Lorimer describes Aqal as ''a small littoral district at the base of the Qatar peninsula upon the east side ; it is bounded b}' Khor-al-Odaid on the north-west and by Dohat-an-Nakholah on the south-east, the distance between j .y which in a direct line is nearly 35 miles. Inland the depth of the district is on an ! ^ ■ average about 20 miles.' [N.B.—Nathal (Sandah) in Aqal is 20 to 25 miles inland, westward, from the foot of Khor-al-Odaid.J ' On the landward side Aqal is enclosed by Mijan on the east, the Jafurah desert on the south and south-west, and by Qatar r on the north-west. . . . The Bedouins do not regard Aqal as geographically included ' : in Oman, which in their view is terminated on the west by the Sabakhat Matti; but ' the district has been recognised by the British Government as forming part of the territories of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and must therefore be considered to belong, in the political sense, to Trucial Oman.' UieD® $ ji to tfile i sera r^ssefl jjEnpas &gt;port« {Hue -;-a 1 im li ssti (iv) Aim Dhabi. In Vol. II, page 405, under ' Ahu Dhahi,' Mr. Lorimer remarks: 'Along the coast Abu Dhabi reaches from ... to Khor-al-Odaid on the west, a distance of over 200 miles. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1895 claimed that his frontier extended to the Bay of Umm-al-Hul, near Wakrah in Qatar, but his claim was not approved by the Government of India ; Bishairiyah has also been named as the limit of his State in this direction, but no good reason has been adduced for supposing that Ms jurisdiction ever extended beyond Khor-al-Odaid, though the northern shore of that inlet should perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories. Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined. It is asserted that on the east they reach to the Bareimi oasis, but without taking it in, and on the south they may presumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba-al-Khali.' -«3ii i l desec (v) Barr-al-Qarah. 1, Lorimer, II, 14:82. U A coastal tract in East Arabia which may perhaps be reckoned as included in the Sanjaq of Ilasa [itself, for the purposes of the Anglo- m Turkish Convention of 1913, included in the Ottoman Sandjak of Nejd]. It reaches ' from Ras-as-Sufairah on the north to the bottom of Dohat-as-Salwa on the south, a ^ distance of about 36 miles ', and inland it extends to a depth of about 12 miles. Lpon the coast it meets Barr-al-Oqair to the north and Qatar to the south of it; and - 1J inland, in all directions, it merges in the Jafurah desert. Some authorities wouldf : even make Barr-al-Qarah a part of Jafurah. ...' f ^ (vi) J a fur ah. ^ Loi imei, II, 892, describes the Jafurah desert as extending the whole way ' from the Hasa Oasis to the confines of Trucial Oman. . . . In shape it is roughly triangular, with its apex on the north almost touching a line drawn between Hofuf and Uqair port and its other corners (to the south-west and south-east) adjoining the Oasis of Jabrin and the southern extremity of Sabakhat Matti respectivel v. . , . On the east it is separated from the sea ' from north to south ' by Barr-al-Qarah, Qatar, Aqal and Mijan ; on the south it is bounded by the Ruba-al Khali. It may be added here that Jalurah encloses Jabrin upon the north and east and that in the opinion of some Barr-al-Qarah is a portion of Jafurah desert and not a separate tract. a ura i c i ers rom the w r aterless Ruba-al-Kliali only in possessing a few wells of sand 61 a 6 SCanty gazing; its surface consists of red and burning I™ 0 Tentl,re , mt - 0 1 tlie northern extremity of Jafurah, but the only tribe who entprincr it co ? lsu era ^ e extei it are the hardy Almorrah and even they avoid \V g hil^n-/ SS - mW1 fr 0 i r i ln se ' dTC ^ of a re fuge from powerful enemies. of*their oameL n!id ling ^ i k Alm orrah as a rule drink nothing but the milk of their camels and even cook their rice in the same ; if compelled to swallow waterI from the wells they first mix it with dried dates to make it more palatable The Wahabis have frequently waged war upon the Almorrah, but Faisal alone, if local tradition is to be believed, succeeded in penetrating with his troops as far as Banaivan and his torce was so reduced by the hardships of the march that he was compelled his arrival there to grant the tribe exceedingly easy terms.' if-—Anglo-Tdrkish Convention of 1913 (unratified).

Une ligue partant du fond, extreme du dit golfe ira directement au Sud jusqu'au Ruba-al-Khali ■ et separera le Nedjd de la presquile d'El-Katr. Les limites du Nedjd sont indiquees par une ligne bleue sur la carte anuexee a la presente Convention (annexe VA). Le Gouvernement Imperial Ottoman ayant renonce a toutes ses reclamations concernant la presqu'ile d'El Katr, il est entendu entre les deux Gouvernerneuts que ladite presqn'ile sera, comme par le passe, gouvernee par le cheikh Djassim-bin-Sani et par ses successeurs. Le gouvernement de Sa Majeste Britaunique declare qu'il ne permettra pas au ckeikh de Bahraine de s'immiscer dans les affaires interieures d'El Katr, de porter atteinte a I'autonomie de ce pays, ou de I'annexer.' [The blue line in question runs due south from the head of the bay opposite Zaknuniyeh Island to the 20th parallel of latitude, where it meets the line of demarcation between Turkish Arabia and the Aden Protectorate laid down under the Anglo-Turkish agreement of Srd June 1914.] 1 Mr. Philby in his crossing of the Ruba-al-Khali in 1932 passed through the Barr-al-Qarah coastal belt with the assistance of Ibn Jiluwi and the Hasa authorities, turning south-west at Salwa and proceeding thence to the Jabrin Oasis. The following extract from his book ' The Empty Quarter ' is of interest, and supplements the evidence of Mr. Bertram Thomas as recorded in paragraphs 16-18 of the Note :— p. 28. ' Ali Jahman . . . rode far ahead gossiping about his experiences on a recent tax collecting expedition to the south-eastern districts along the frontier of Oman. ... I was interested to hear from him that Ibn Sa'ud's influence is felt to-day in all the Dhahira country, as they call the tract westward of the Oman Massif, including, of course, Buraimi, a Wahhabi centre of long standing, and apparently even Ibri. These tax collecting expeditions scarcely perhaps di more than pay the expenses involved in equipping and sending them out, but they do tend to spread the gospel of Wahhabi peace and Arabian unity. Slowly but surelv the ripples of stable government broaden outwards from the centre and the Manasir may be counted to-day as subjects of Ibn Saud, who asks little of them but the acceptance of his sovereignty and the maintenance of his- peace. . . .' {N.B. —The Manasir tribe are concentrated in the Abu Dhabi area, ranging from Qatar to the Baraimi Oasis.)('Received under India Office ^ranted Letter No P.Z.914/^4).

Alter courtesies the Political Resident said that he wished to discuss the question ol oil and asJfcea Shaikh 'Abdullah now the matter stands between him hud trie Anglo-Persian Oil Coaipany Limited. 3. The trend of Shaikh 'Abdullah's conversation was as follows:- fTr ihe agreement between me and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited expires at the end of Tour months and then i can consider whether their ofier is best lor me or another Company's oi'ler is best. I wxll mlorm Government but i am sure thai tney will not wish me to accept an oiler whicn is not the best, in the discussion which tooic place between mw and the Company (Angle Persian Oil Company Limited) nothing could be arranged. Some tirae bacK they made an oiler and alter discussions I came to an understanding with tneir representative wno said that he only wanted to show the terms to the Company and then get it signed. The Company then changed their mind and made new oilers which were not in my interest. Mr.Ciiisholia is not a straight-!orward fflan and I aid not expect that he will play a trick like this (The Political Resident broke in that Mr.Ciiisholm would only be acting under the orders ol' his Company,so should not be thoughi personally responsible). The Company did not make an increase in the royalties which would be a source ol real income to me. /The2. The Coiapany made some increase in certain things but these are ol no importaiiCe. i took great pains ana spent a lot ol' money m mamtsaning pecioe and order in tiie desert* Tlow x want to reap tlie iruits ol my work, if i ask lor more money from the Company it is because i will have to pay half of it to the bedouins and others (iron the wording this clearly referred to Bin oa ud/« it the; British uoveminent do rut allow me to ^ive the concession to any other Company whose oiler may be suitable, I will leave the lana and will no longer iiaice trouble about it, as there is no beneiit in retaining' it when I cannot get proper profit from it. n 4. The question of protection arose in connection with his remarks about payments to bedouin ana he was pressed to say of what he was afraid. He spoke of a M big enemy** and bedouin in general terms. The rolitical Kesident reminaed him ol his request ior protection when tne aeroplane lamiin*.; ground was being discussed,ano asked what was in nis mind,then ana now. lie replied that was past and should not be aiscusseu now (but it was not clear whether he meant tnat the landing ground business was past or that he no longer aesirea protection so much), fie saia 'The -iuestion of protection is ^uite different one wnich requires a separate and lengthy discussion, i may accept protection provided it does not interfere with my authority (sharafij 5. The Political Resident then said that he had something OJ^ private to say,and Shaikhs Hamaa bin Ubaullaxx,K&amp;cilifah bin Ubdullah and Salih bin Mam f went out of the Majlis. The Political Resident then brielly recapitulated tne position, making it clear that he would only be alloweu to give the concession to a Company which was partly British,that the hasa /Company% ■ V 3 Company was not British at all,and that (though not so directly statecj li he concession to tne Axi^io-Persian Oil Company Limited or other British Company,Government would protect him. 01 i icers Irom n.ia.S Fowey who ha a. been invitee to amner then arrivedj and the ohaikh was told that the matter would be discussed again on the lollowmg morning and that if he wished to talk things over with Shaikh Hamad or Salih bin Mem' ne and there was no objection to their being present, could do so/should he wish it, at the next aay*s meeting.

In short we talkeu about tne oil concession,and 1 have been authorized by His Majesty's Government to inform you tnat they would not agree to the concession being given to a Company which is not partly British. Shaikh . It is unjust lor me that I should be prevented Irom doing what 1 think is best in my interest, in Kuwait the concession is unaer discussion (here he meant that the Shaikh of Kuwait has the option to decide what ne thought best) and m Bahrain where the Government have influence the concession has been given to a loreign Company. I do not think that the Government would do injustice m my case. Resident . (Produced Article V of tne treaty). According to this you cannot give the concession to any Company without the consent of the Government. * Shaikh . 1 have not yet given any concession,but,il at the expiry oi* tne period allowed to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company,! do not come to an understanding with them, I will give a Prospecting License to any Company who come forward to me and if alter the ,ro spec ting License is over 1 come to an agreement with them 1 will submit /the •Note. It is clear that Shaikh 'Abdullah and his advisers have been carefully and cleverly tutored.'3^ k \ . f the same to His Britannic Majesty's Government lor tiieir approval auci only alter getting their consent tn&amp;t I will grant tiie concession- Hesiaent. Ko foreign Company will take the Prospecting License if they are not sure of getting the concession. It wouici only be waste of time for them* it would also i be diiiicult for Your Excellency to retuse them. Shaikh . i will make a stipulation in the agreement and they will be bound to abide by its terms. I will then refer the matter 10 the Government ana if they do not agree i will see waat can be clone then. ( Shaikh Hamad * The matter is a commercial one ana it is lor us to see what is best in our interests. I do not think that the Government would like to press us and do us injustice. The Bahrain Gil Concession was given to a foreign Company,although Bahrain is under the mlluence of the Government), i will convey to the Highest Authorities of the Government what i have to say then and as it is now only a verbal conversation and nothing in black and white in a formal way i need not add further. Surely the Government would not agree to anything contrary to rules ana justice. When Knox wanted to do (he did not mention wnat was that thing) they aid not allow him. ^t any rate I have not yet done anytning contrary to the terms ol the ireaty ana would leave matters for discussion when such terms are being infringed. The Ireaty does not include the interior but only the coast and 1 have some other arrangement with Bin I^a'ua according to which no one i ventures to encroach upon my territory, ile noes not /encroach5. encroach upon my territory because i am very I'nenaiy with ni.u ana do not cio anything which aispleases him besiaes my giving him something.

According to Bin Sa f ud f s Treaty with the British uovernmeru he cannot mteriere m your at lairs ano. it is because of your Treaty with the Government that he cannot do anything sna it he does,the Govern ment will prevent him. Ana you are the Ruler ol all Qatar ana tne Treaty extends to tne whole ol' yatar. 3haiich » But I go not see why I should be compelled to give the concession to tne Anglo-fereian Oil Company, if the Anglo-Persian Oil Company do not olier me good terms according to the agreement between me and their representative and i am not sstisiiea with what they offer,and if 1 am not allowec by the Government to give it to ethers 1 will leave the oil m its place and give it to no one. I lived all this time without oil. i am now frightened of this Company. 1 thought that whenever trouble snses between me and the Company,the Government will act as an arbitrator between us. I now see that it is the Government who is lighting to get the concession for the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, if this is the case to whom can i submit my complaint against them it they happen to take the concession. Resident . The Government want Your excellency to give the oil concession to the Anglo -Persian Oil Company but they would not necessarily compel you to grive it to them. They would not agree to the concession being given to a Company which is not partly British# il you give the concession to the Anglo -Persian Oil Company they /are—are under the influence of tne Government,who will be able to help you,and there will be less interference in jour affairs, i think that Your excellency thinks tnat the Anglo- 1 ersian Oil Company is a Government concern ana taat there will,therefore,be mterlerence in your authority. If you give the Concession to a i foreign Company the Government will then interfere morejfor the Anglo--ersian Oil Company nave their hea'a- quarters in London and the Government can Dring pressure on them there,whereas if it is a foreign Company,Uien the Government will have to interfere with them in jjatar instead. (This point was emphasisec more than oncej. i have not come on behalf of the Company but for the Political part of the matter which is the affair of the Government which is concerned about their Treaty with you.

Now the Government are prepared to protect you against an attack by land ana to help you with the necessary force in case of an attack upon you. /ThatThat is to protect the whole of Qatar. This is an important thing ior it means that not only would you rule in salety,but in time (which God forbid.; it will mean that your successors of the ibn Thani Fanaiy will continue to rule.

India Office, P .Z. 614/34. ■ ' • ' JLt'^ i *4^ Memo. B. 430. j Tvvt The Southern Boundary of Qatar and the Connected Problems. The question for settlement is that of the boundaries of the Sheikhdom of Qatar where it is not bounded by the sea. In the pre-war period the boundary to the south was to some extent indeterminate, but broadly speaking was regarded at the time of the compilation of Lorimer's Gazetteer in 1905-07 as running across the base of the ™ 1Ir Qatar Peninsula more or less south-east from Dohat-as-Saiwa to a point north of ' ) ' Khor-al-'Odeid. There is reason to believe that the Sheikh of Qatar still regards it as following approximately this line (see paragraph 8 below), but conditions have not been propitious for raising the question specifically with him, and the present note aims at reaching a provisional conclusion on the material available as to— (а) the southern boundary of Qatar ; (б) if the boundaries of Qatar on the south and west do not extend to the blue line agreed as the eastern frontier of Nejd in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913, the position of the intervening area. The history of the question is as follows :— T he B oundary on the S outh- E ast. 2. To the east, the boundary between Qatar and the adjoining Trucial Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi has been the subject of frequent dispute in the past. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has claimed sovereignty over a stretch of Qatar territory running so far Lor. II, 405. | north as the Bay of Umm-al-Hul, south of Wakra on the map attached.'^ The Sheikh of Qatar, for his part, has claimed sovereignty over areas in the Abu Dhabi Sheikhdom running as far east as the Sabakhat Matti. His Majesty's Government Lor. II, SB- have consistently refused to recognise claims so exaggerated by either party, but they have repeatedly intimated that they regard the Khor-al-'Odeid, which lies about mid way between the extreme points referred to, as appertaining to Abu Dhabi. They have Lor. II, 89. also recognised the Abu Dhabi claim to the district of 'Aqal, geographical details of which are given in I (iii) of the Appendix to this note, and which contains both the Khor-al-'Odeid and the Khor-adh-Dhuwaihin. We have thus a fixed point for the south-eastern boundary of Qatar. T he B oundary on the S outh- W est. 3. On the south-western extremity of the Qatar boundary there has been no corresponding dispute, nor is there a fixed point equally definitely established which can with confidence be regarded as marking the western limit of the territories of Qatar. T he P osition prior to the A nglo- T urkish C onvention of 1913. 4. The southern boundary of Qatar was closely investigated locally between 1904 and 1907 by experienced political officers in connection A\ith the compilation of Mr. Lorimer's ' Persian Gulf Gazetteer.' The result of theii investigation is given in the extract from the Gazetteer reproduced as item I (i) in the Appendix to t js note. Broadly speaking, it went to show that the southern boundary of the State ran south-east from Dohat -as-Salwa to a point to the north of the Khor-al-Odeid. Over the first section, running irom Dohat -as-Salw r a to the W ells of ^akak, there was no dispute. The boundary between the Wells of Sakak and the sea on the eastern side of the Qatar Peninsula was, however, indeterminate. Two alternatives (the difference at its widest point being some 20 miles) were reported by Lonmer. lor the reasons given by him (and substantially based on the historical considerations referred to in paragraph 2 above) he regarded the second alternative as preferable. The effect of its acceptance would be that the eastern sector of the southern Qatar boundary would run south-east from the \\ells of Sakak to the sea noit o u Khor-al-'Odeid. * Not reproduced. 2560 25 3.34P.Z. 299/31.. The Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913. 5 Discussion over the years 1911-13 between the Turkish Government and His Majesty's Government on the various matters m dispute between them m the Persian Gulf area culminated in the latter year m the signatare of two Convention, defining inter alia the eastern limits of Turkish authority m Arabia. The t onveution of 29th July 1913, which defined the eastern boundary of Nejd is alone relevant for the present purpose. Under that Convention which though reference is made to it in the ratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 9th March 1914 was never itself ratified, the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjaq of Nejd was defined by a blue me on the map running due south from the head of the bay opposite Zaqnnniyeh Island in the Persian Gulf to the 20th parallel of latitude in the Central Arabian Desert. The text of the relevant article is given in section If of the Appendix attached to this Note. Its wording (' nne ligue . . . separera le Nedjd de la presqn lie d El ICatr U s limites du Nedjd sont indiquees par une ligne bleue . . . ) would justify the contention that the blue line was at once the eastern frontier of Nejd and the western frontier of Qatar. But there are definite objections to^ adopting this view. In the first place, there is nothing to show tbat this was, m fact, the intention of His Majesty's Government at the time when the Convention was concluded, or that they had any object beyond limiting the eastern boundary of the Turkish possessions in this area. Secondly, there is no evidence of any claim to suzerainty by Qatar so far to the west or so far to the south. Thirdly, the Resident's telegram of 11th January 1934, T. 19, emphasises the absence of control by the Sheikh of Qatar over the interior of his State (and a fortiori over regions so remote from Dohah as _ are now under consideration). Fourthlv (though this by itself is probably not of serious importance) the position vis-a-vis Ibn Saud is to some extent compromised, as explained below, at any rate as regards the Barr-al-Qarah, by the line fixed by Sir Percy Cox in 1922. Fifthly, it is arguable that even in a formal document such as the 1913 Convention, the fact that the blue line is spoken of separating Nejd from the Qatar Peninsula, need not be regarded as determining the boundary of Qatar. The Qatar Peninsula was the closest prominent geographical feature and the nearest adjoining Arab political entity on the mainland, and a reference to it for descriptive purposes was not unnatural. Finally, there is much to be said for giving no avoidable extensions to the boundaries of Qatar, even if the consequence is that we have to deal with an area of indeterminate ownership between those boundaries and the blue line. L ine indicated in 1922 by S ir P. Cox to I bn S aud and M ajor H olmes as the E astern L imit of any O il C oncession in respect of H asa. 6. One more incident of importance should be recorded before coming to the latest evidence as to the view held by the Sheikh of Qatar as to his southern boundary. The incident is that referred to in Colonel Dickson's letter of 4th July 1933, No. 143, to the Political Resident, copies of which were received under the Political Resident's express letter of 18th December 1933, No. 1934 S., when Sir p.z. 180/34. Percy Cox, who was then High Commissioner for Iraq, in a discussion at Oqairin 1922 with Ibn Saud, then Sultan of Nejd, and Major Holmes, warned both the Sultan and Major Holmes that the Sultan could grant no concession, and Major Holmes receive none from him, in respect of the Principality of Qatar, and drew on a map a line running from Djau-ed-Dukhan to Dohat-as-Salwa, which, he indicated, must represent the eastern boundary of any concession granted by Ibn Saud in respect of Hasa. feuch a line, as will be seen from the map, excludes the whole Qatar Peninsula (and incidentally a substantia] area lying to the west of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention). It also includes in Hasa an area to the east of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention. It should, however, be noted that while it constituted a definite indication of the High Commissioner's view as to the eastern boundary of Hasa, it in no way specifically defined the boundaries of Qatar save in so far as Qatar might be regarded as marching with Hasa and Nejd, or might be i m aS heen granted a western frontier bounded by the blue line of the 191 o Convention at the time when that Convention was concluded.^' 7- The statement reported in Bushire Memorandum No. 947 S. of 20th December looo t0 i have , be f n 'T 1 * 3 Sir R Cox that Ibl1 Saud had agreed with Sir P. Cox, in ■J , the boundary line between Nejd and Qatar should follow a line running ue south from the end of the bay south of Bahrein Island and just east of Mabak as prinlfasApTend' IVTZ ^ e0Iltailled ^ ^ ^ dated 27th FebraarJr m Bushire Memo. 947 S. of 20th Dec. 1922. P.Z. 464/ 33.mil?' 1 i,, j i [aiiit; shown on Fraser-HuntGi s rnap, stands by itself, as sucli an arrangGmGnt was nGver apparently rGcordGd in writing by the two partiGS or officially confirmGd. Such a line would, of course, be quite inconsistent with the maintenance of the blue line. It would equally give a very substantial extension to the boundaries of Qatar an extension of much more practical importance now than in 1922, when there was no question of active exploitation of the hinterland, and our concern was chiefly to maintain the independence of the sheikhdoms of the Arab littoral against Tbn Saud. The statement is, no doubt, an alternative version of Sir P. Cox's warning to Ibn Saud as to the eastern boundary of any concession to be granted by him in respect of Hasa discussed in tliG prGCoding paragraph, of which an authoritative record based on personal knowledge is given in Colonel Dickson's letter of 4th July 1933, No. 143. I.P.C. M ap of F ebruary- M arch 1933. 8. The map compiled by the I.P.C. geologists during their survey in Qatar in February -March 1933 marks a southern boundary line starting on the sca-coast immediately south of Jabul-cl-Naksh about 10 miles north of Salwa town and 12 miles north of the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, turning abruptly to the south- souch -east immediately south-east of Jabul-el-Naksh for a distance of some 12 miles to Qalat-ali-Bin-Said, and thence running due east, leaving Tuair-al-Hamir on its left, through the Wadi-al-Ghurban to the sea, which it apparently leaches at a point some 8 miles north of the outlet of the Khor-al-'Odcid inlet and not very far into the Naqiyan Sandhills, The A.P.O.C., in communicating a copy of this map, remarked : ' The dotted line boundary to the south of Qatar is apparently the Sheikh's version of the line. The I.P.C. report, however, is not definite about this.' The A.P.O.C. have since reported that, according to one member (Haji A. F. Williamson) of the geological party which visited Qatar in February and March 1933, the southern boundary shown on their map w^as indicated by the Sheikh himself. If the line in fact represents his view, the boundary, as will be seen, will correspond very closely to the pre-war line recorded by Lorimer. C onclusions as to the S outhern B oundary of Q atar. 9. It is suggested, in the light of the evidence collected above — (a) that the south-eastern boundary of Qatar must lie to the north of the Khor-al-'Odeid and the district of 'Aqal; that while His Majesty's Government had at no stage formally recognised any specific southern boundary to Qatar (save to the extent icferred to m (a)), such evidence as is available goes to show that the pre-war boundary ran roughly south-east across the base of the Peninsula, from Dohat-as-Salwa, or a point slightly north of it, to a point north of the Khor -al-'Odeid. There is no recorded evidence of any more extensive claims by the Sheikh of Qatar other than those to Abu Dhabi territory referred to in paragraph 2 above ; m -i i r r\ . in the light of the above, that, if it proves that the^ Sheikh of Qatar now regards the line shown on the I.P.C. map as his southern boundary, this may be accepted by His Majesty's Government as generally satisfactory. Acceptance of that line, if we continue to regard the blue line of the 1913 Convention as the eastern boundary o± Ibn baud s territories (or even if we were to agree to the attribution of the Barr-ah Qarah district lying east of the blue line to Hasa (see paragraph 18 below)) will admittedly leave an area of undetermined ownership between Qatar and Nejd. The problems involved in this are discussed in greater detail in paragraphs 10 and following If however. His Majesty s Government are prepared to face them, the boundary m question has the merits that it is consistent with the obligations we have undertaken to Abu Dhabi • it is equally consistent with the maintenance of the blue line of thei9J3 Convention as against Ibn Saud (or with such a modih- cation of that line as is referred to m paragraph 19 (c) (i) below and i has the advantage of definitely limiting the area of any commitments m respect of protection, &amp;c., into which His Majesty s Government may think it desirable to enter in the event of an oil concession being granted by the Sheikh. P.Z. 450/34, (c)P osition of A rea lying between B ase of Q atar P eninsula and B lue L ine of A nglo -T urkish C onvention of 1913. 10. If, in these circumstances, it is accepted that the southern boundary of Qatar should be a line running via or to the north of bakak more or less south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa or a point slightly to the north of Dohat-as-Salwa to a point to the north of the Khor-al-'Odeid, the difficult question arises of the position of the country lying between such a line and the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. I mportance of M aintaining the B lue L ine. 11, On the one hand, it appears definitely important if possible to maintain the blue line laid down in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as against Ibn Saud or any other future ruler of this part of Arabia. While the 1913 Convention was never ratified, the blue line at any rate represents the agreement reached at the time between Turkey and His Majesty's Government as to the limits of Turkish authority in northern Arabia and on the Persian Gulf, and in dealing with Ibn Saud as the successor in title to the Turks we can, it would seem, not unreasonably take our stand on it. The difficulties of finding any satisfactory substitute are patent. The undesirability of giving Ibn Saud, in the absence of any definite eastern boundary ;»»- to his territories, an excuse for territorial expansion (as distinct from the exercise, as -jli^ at present, of an informal influence and the receipt from our Arab clients of payments T ' which we do not recognise and the existence of which we ignore) in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast and of Muscat is equally clear. Such expansion would clearly involve a risk either of his coming into conflict with the local rulers, whose treaty relations with His Majesty's Government he has formally recognised, or of his establishing an influence in the Sheikhdoms in question so powerful as to be embarrassing from our point of view.

At the same time, important on general grounds, for the reasons given, as the maintenance of the blue line appears to be, the fact must be faced that in the present case, if we continue to regard it as the eastern boundary of Ibn Saud's territory, and if, as suggested, we accept a southern boundary lor Qatar running roughly across the base of the Qatar Peninsula, a not inconsiderable area lying between the two btates, and peopled by migratory Bedouin tribes, will be left in an indeterminate political position. There is a possibility that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who has in the past exercised a wide influence, and made tribal alliances of his own in the Crucial hinterland—c/. Sir P. Cox's letter No. 176 of 28th June 1904—might prefer some claim to such an area. But, though on this point further information will be sought fiom the Resident, there seems little evidence of any active interest on the part oi Aim Dhabi in any area to the west of 'Aqal. Assuming that no such claim exists, or C0ll ld be substantiated, the alternatives are to recognise the area as belonging to-Ibn Saud; to recognise it as belonging to the Sheikh of Qatar; or to regard it as a political no-man's land. lo. If we recognised it as belonging to Ihn Saud we could, if necessary, call upon him to keep Bedouin raids into Qatar from it under control. But such recognition would not merely be inconsistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the 1913 Convention, to the abandonment of which, as stated above, the objections appear to be ^ s long, u ^ou represent a formal acceptance of Saudi sovereignty to the borders - -or Qatar and Abu Dhabi which might well prove embarrassing. Nt v., || • Jfi' | If ' 0n the ? the r it is attributed to the Sheikh of Qatar, we should be Hki( 't f ' 11 t co - 0 P eratl0n of the Sheikh in dealing with Bedouin i l imits But such an attribution would not merely give lo Qatar 1,1 the P-'. appear to have claimed, but woi,Id with the orant of an ml ^ 1 1 01 P 1 ! 0 ^ 60 ^ 11 which we may undertake in connection an rate fts coastal ^ be nece ^ry to claim the area (or at anj late its coastal strip) for Qatar if there were serious signs of foreign interest in it or of an intention on the part of Ibn Saud to occupyT But 3inf such developments it seems wiser to limit our commitments and to avoid anv extension of the area recognised by us as Qatar. y extension ui 'Hgratf1®' The decision to regard it as a politica would, so far as can be judged, be likely to mean little more than the acceptance of the position to -day. As will be seen from paragraphs 16 to 18 below, the area/save for the Barr -al -Qarah district is largely desert, peopled by nomadic tribes yielding uncertain allegiance to Ibn Sand, and it appears to differ little in general conditions from the Rub-al-Khah fnrther sontn. Admittedly the absence of a limitrophe rnler who conld be made responsible for the activities of his subjects, may make it more difficult to secure the southern border of Qatar against nomadic Bedouins. But the difficulties involved may be less than they appear. The difficulties of any alternative to regarding the tract as of indeterminate ownership are great, and at any rate as a provisional policy there would appear to be much to be said for treating this area as indeterminate m ownership and avoiding, if possible, raising the thorny (Questions of its boundaries to the west and of political control within it with Ibn Saud, N ature and P olitical C onditions of the I ndeterminate A rea. 16. Before reaching a conclusion it may be well to place on record such scanty information as is available about the nature and the political conditions of the from the coastal district known as the Barr-al-Qarah, paragraph 18 below, the bulk of it appears to belong .orimfvr dfRnrihps ns an area 'possessing only a few indeterminate area. Apart which is further discussed in ^ o x to the Jafurah desert, which Lonmer describes as cm_c4 ujuij ' a xcw wells of very bitter water, a little scanty grazing, with a surface of red and burning- sand,' in which living conditions are extremely difficult and which is frequented ' to any considerable extent' only by 'the hardy A1 Morrah, and even they avoid entering it unless in winter or in search of a refuge from more powerful enemies ' (c/. Appendix, section I (vi)). Since the date of Lorimer's Gazetteer, Mr. Bertram Thomas, on his recent crossing of the Rub-al-Khali, has passed through this area from south to north, travelling from the well of Banaiyan near Latitude 23° 11' 40'' via Haluwain, Nakhala, and the western extremity of a salt lake lying immediately west of the Khor-al-'Odeid, across the pre-war Qatar frontier to Dohah. His account is of importance because it makes it clear that such local control as is exercised is exercised solely by nomad Bedouin tribes (and principally the A1 Murra, who are a tribe dwelling in the sands, whose influence extends well down into the Rub-al-Khali). Secondly, even though he travelled with a 'rabia,' or guarantor, from the A1 Murra tribe, the journey was rendered extremely dangerous by the risk of an attack on the party by Ikhwan fanatics, who roam apparently at large, over the whole area. Thirdly, the sites of Salwa, Iskak (? = Sakak) and Mabak, the first two of which lie on, and the third slightly south of, the pre-war boundary of Qatar, were at the time of his journey in the hands of the Ikhwan, with the result that he could not visit them. 17. On the question of political conditions Mr. Thomas throughout his journey (the route of which lay well to the east of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention) from the centre of the Kub-al-Khali northwaids to the Bersian Gulf refers to the established influence of Ibn Saud and its beneficent lesults, and remarks: 'To-day peace, the peace of Bin Sauo, prevails thioughout the sands. The influence of the Ruler of Central Arabia, wielded through his able Viceroy at Hofuf, Ibn Jiluwi, compels peace between all these old enemies, not through direct control, for there is and can be none, but through the immense personal prestige of Abdul Aziz himself. A belief in his strength and star has swept across the sands. Not love, but awe, serves this wise providence that so directs affaiis. ... . us, t e sand tribes proper are in some degree leagued with Bin Saud. Ihey pay to him a nominal tribute and by that act are ensured mutual protection one lom le o er. In theory the tribute is an annual levy of one dollar on each came . n piac ice, le Rashid have no money, and in any event they escape proper paymen \ reason^ o their remoteness. They do, however, send a camel from year to year as occasion offers in token of submission. When, however, rams fall m the northern sands and they migrate thither, the tax-gatherers' demands must be met and a few camels are sold for the purpose.

Arabia Felix, pp. 271-2. 2560 A 26 T he Baeb-al- Q abah D istrict. 18 The importance of this district for the present purpose is first that it embraces the coastal strip lying between the blue line and the pre-war western extremity of Qatar and secondly that it appears to correspond fairly closely, if not exactly, with the triangle of land' lying to the east of the blue line, which falls withm the area left to the west of the rough line indicted to Ibn Saud and Major Holmes by Sir P. Cox in 11)22 (see paragraph 6 above). Mr. Philby, with the assistance of recommendations and guides furnished by Ibn Jiluwi, the Saudi Governor of Hasa, travelled through a portion of it in 1932. The impression left by his 'Empty Quarter' is that the dominant political influence at the present day are the Saudi Government and the Ikliwan. Details of the Barr-al-Qarah district are given in the extract from Lorimer reproduced as item I (v) in the Appendix to this Note. As will ^ be seen, Lorimer considered that it 'might perhaps be reckoned as included in the Sanjaq of Hasa'— in other words, in the pre-war Ottoman Sandjaq of Nejd. On this assumption the boundaries of Nejd in the 1913 Convention might well have been fixed so as to include it, with the result that the limits of Nejd would have touched the pre-war limits of Qatar on the coastline at the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, the hinterland (actually the Jafurah Desert) being left in indeterminate ownership. For whatever reason (and it must be assumed that substantial justification was produced to persuade the Turks to relinquish their position in the Barr-al-Qarah) the line was in fact fixed farther to the west. But the history of the Barr-al-Qarah, and the fact that the 1913 Convention had never been ratified, may well have been the reasons which led Sir P. Cox in 1922 to fix the limits of Hasa at a point which included in it the Barr-al-Qarah rather than at the blue line of the 1913 Convention, ^C onclusions. 19. In the light of the examination of the position given above, and subject to the observations of the Government of India and the Political Resident, the best course would appear to be the following :— (a) Boundaries of Qatar. —To agree that the boundaries of Qatar shall be accepted as being on the north, east and west, the sea ; on the south, a line running across the base of the Peninsula from a point not south of the latitude of the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay to a point not south of the north side of the Khor-al-Odeid inlet. Ihe line indicated on the I.P.C. map would satisfy these criteria, and if it is confirmed that it is the line at present claimed by the Sheikh of Qatar it could be accepted. A slight modification to bring the line some 12 miles south to the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, and so to reduce the area of sea coast in indeterminate ownership, could be considered if necessary. (h) The hlue line of the 1913 Convention, to be maintained as against Ibn Saud, for the reasons given in paragraph 11 above, as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia. (c) If a- claim is advanced by Ibn Saud to the Barr-al-Qarah on the ground of the line indicated by Sir Percy Cox in the Oqair conversations in 1922,* referred to in pai agraph 6, that His Majesty's Government should either— (i) concede the claim, on the ground, if necessary, that they regarded themselves as committed by the informal conversations of 1922, but ^ ithout piejudice to the maintenance in principle of the blue line, and in return for a formal recognition by Ibn Saud of the validity of this line. e attribution to Ibn Saud of the Barr-al-Qarah area, undesirable as it nmy be on other grounds, would have the advantage of leaving no gap of i^ftermmate territory bordering on the sea coast, for we can without aimculty, as suggested in (a) above, recognise the frontiers of Qatar as beginnmg at Dohat-as-Salwa, i.e. at the point at which the Barr-al -Qarah ^ as ^bought preferable to make no concession in respect of -ifK).-) 3 !1 -i • ^ f 11 ar S ue that informal discussions such as those of w ic ad never been confirmed in writing or been the subject of formal agreement, had no binding effect, and that His Majesty's tW I k r y Stand ou the 1,11,6 line - Pla y mi g ht be made with sim nf at . th , e h ) ne 1 draw ? b y Sir Percy Cox would, in fact, deprive Ibir side oftL to?Hne ^ ^ betWeen D i an - ed - D »^an and the western, * Cp. on this point paragraph 5 of the Note reprodnoed as Appendix IV to this Memorandum.(d) The area lying between the blue line and the houndaries recognised for Qatar as in . a) above to oe regarded, subject to confirmation by the Resident that no claim to them is made or could be substantiated west of Aqal by Abu Dhabi^ as of indeterminate ownership. As it appears to be largely inhospitable desert under Ikhwan control, save for the coastal strip of the Barr-al-Qarah, the likelihood that oil companies will actively interest themselves in it is probably small, if they do, on the principle that Ibn Saud nas no mteiest east oi' the blue line, it might be necessary to consider whether to attribute it to Qatar or Abu Dhabi (the wording of the 1913 Convention, as c^uotsd m paragraph 5 above, would assist us in claiming it for Qatar). It would in any event be desirable, in order to prevent foreign interests from endeavouring to establish a foothold in it, to consider in what way it could best be made clear that we regarded it as falling within our own sphere of influence or that of one of our Trncial allies. {e) When once oil operations have started in Qatar, to convey a warning (if and when circumstances should make this appear advisable) through the Sheikh of Qatar to the migratory Bedouin tribes who use the area referred to in (d) that in the event of their crossing, with hostile intent or save for normal peaceful pursuits, such as grazing, such line as may be fixed as the boundary of Qatar, they will do so at their own peril. The local political authorities would no doubt be able to ascertain and to advise what customary rights in respect of grazing, &amp;c. these migratory tribes at present enjoy within Qatar proper. On the question whether any corresponding intimation should be made to Ibn Saud in respect of tribes permanently belonging to Nejd but using the indeterminate area it seems definitely preferable, in the interest of avoiding discussion with him of the position of the indeterminate area and of the blue line, to make no communication unless and until circumstances make this quite inevitable. The question of any communication in respect of Nejdi tribes (if any) using Qatar territory could equally be postponed unless and until circumstances may make it necessary to consider it.

Boundaries of Qatar. I—Extracts from Lorimer's Gazetteer. (i) Qatar. {N.B.—M t. Lorimer's article on Qatar is stated to be the result of special enquiries made over a number of years locally.) Lorimer, Vol. II, page 1506, defines the boundaries of Qatar as follows : ' On the east, north and west, Qatar is surrounded by the sea The southern boundarv is somewhat indeterminate. It begins at the foot of Dohat-as-balwa on the western side of the promontory, and from that point nms south-eastwards to the wells of Sakak: thence, according to one account, it strikes east-north east to the north end of the Naqiyan sandhills, or, according to another, east by south to the southern end of the same hills on the north side of the entrance to Khor-al-'Odaid. As the territory of the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has never ■clearly been asserted to extend beyond Khor-al-'Odaid, and as the Al-Tham Sheikhs of Qatar undoubtedly claim the Naqiyan tract, the latter of the two m i .ialternative lines is to be preferred ; the British Government have recognised Khor-al-'Odaid as belonging to Abu Dhabi and the boundary consequently cannot be placed nearer to Trucial Oman, though the Al-Thani Sheikhs assert a right to the whole coast as far as the feabakhat Matti. It is said that three men stationed at Dohat-as-Salwa, Sakak and Niqa-al-Maharah, respectively, can watch the whole southern border of Qatar from sea to sea.' (ii) Khor-al- Odaid. In Vol. II, on page 1367, Mr. Lorimer describes Khor-al-'Odaid as ' an inlet or creek on the coast of the Abu Dhabi principality as its extreme western end: it lies about 180 miles almost due west from the town of Abu Dhabi. The boundary of Qatar is either at, or a short distance to the north of, the inlet.' it it t0 felli W is to felorce (iii) 'Aqal. In Vol. II, pages 88-89, Mr. Lorimer describes 'Aqal as 44 a small littoral district at the base of the Qatar peninsula upon the east side ; it is bounded by Khor-al-Odaid on the north-west and by Dohat-an-Nakharlah on the south-east, the distance between which in a direct line is nearly 35 miles. Inland the depth of the district is on an average about 20 miles.' [N.B.—Nathil (Saudah) in 'Aqal is 20 to 25 miles inland, westward, from the foot of Khor-al-'Odaid.] ' On the landward side 'Aqal is enclosed by Mijan on the east, the Jafurah desert on the south and south-west, and by Qatar on the north-west. . . . The Bedouins do not regard 'Aqal as geographically included in Oman, which in their view is terminated on the west by the Sabakhat Matti; but the district has been recognised by the British Government as forming part of the territories of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and must therefore be considered to belong, in the political sense, to Trucial Oman.' I Jems Aiaisa! fK!® • i iSlli (iv) Ahu Dhabi. In Vol. II, page 405, under 'Ahu Dhahi,' Mr. Lorimer remarks: 'Upon the coast Abu Dhabi reaches from ... to Khor-al-'Odaid on the west—a distance of over 200 miles. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1895 claimed that his frontier extended to the Bay of Umm-al-Hul, near Wakrah in Qatar, but his claim was not approved by the Government of India; Bishairiyah has also been named as the limit of his State in this direction, but no good reason has been adduced for supposing that bis jurisdiction ever extended beyond Khor-al-'Odaid, though the northern shore of that inlet should perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories. Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined. It is asserted that on the east they reach to the Baraimi oasis, but without taking it in, and on the south they may presumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba'-al-Khali.' (v) Barr-al-Qarah. Lot imei, II, 1482. A coastal tract in Eastern Arabia which may perhaps be reckoned as included in the Sanjaq of Ilasa [itself, for the purposes of the Anglo- J urkish Convention of 1913, included m the Ottoman Sandjak of Nejdl. It reaches trom Kas-as-Sufairah on the north to the bottom of Dohat-as-Salwa on the south, a distance of about 36 miles ; and inland it extends to a depth of about 12 miles.

' The Ajman venture into the northern extremity of Jafurah, hut the only tribe who frequent it to any consideiable extent are the hardy A1 Morrah and even they avoid entering it unless in v\ int6i 01 m search of a refuge from powerful enemies . . . While sojourning in Jafurah the A1 Morrah as a rule drink nothing but the milk of their camels and even cook their rice in the same ; if compelled to swallow water from the wells they first mix it with dried dates to make it more palatable. The Wahabis have frequently waged war upon the A1 Morrah, but Faisal alone, if local tradition is to be believed, succeeded in penetrating with his troops as far as Banaiyan, and his force was so reduced by the hardships of the desert march that he was compelled on his arrival there to grant the tribe exceedingly easy terms.' II.—A nglo-Tdrkish Convention of 1913 ( unratified). El-Katr. Article 11. 'Le Sandjak Ottoman de Nedjd, dont la limite septentrionale est indiquee par la ligne de demarcation definie a I'article 7 de cette convention, se termine vers le sud au golfe faisant face a Tile de Zahnounie, qui appartient au dit Sandjak. Une ligne partant du fond extreme du dit golfe ira directement au Sud jusqu'au Ruba-al-Khali et separera le Nedjd de la presqu'ile d'El-Katr. Les limites du Nedjd sont indiquees par une ligne bleue sur la carte annexee a la presente Convention (annexe VA). Le Gouvernement Imperial Ottoman ayant renonce a toutes ses reclamations concernant la presqu'ile d'El Katr, il est entendu entre les denx Gouvernements que ladite presqu'ile sera, comme par le passe, gouvernee par le cheikh Djassim-bin-Sani et par ses successeurs. Le gouvernement de Sa Majeste Britannique declare qu'il ne permettra pas an ckeikh de Bahraine de s'immiscer dans les aiiaires interieures d'El Katr, de porter atteinte a I'autonomie de ce pays, ou de I'annexer.' [The blue line in question runs due south from the head of the bay opposite Zaknuniyeh Island to the 20th parallel of latitude, where it meets the line of demarcation between Turkish Arabia and the Aden Protectorate laid down under the Anglo-Turkish agreement of 3rd June 1914.] III.— Mr. Philby's Journey of 1932. Mr. Philby in his crossing of the Ruba-al -Khali in 1932 passed through the Barr-al-Qarah coastal belt with the assistance of Ibn Jiluwi and the Hasa authorities, turning south-west at Salwa and proceeding thence to the Jabrin Oasis. 1 he following extract from his book ' The Empty Quarter is of interest, and supplements the evidence of Mr. Bertram Thomas as recorded in paragraphs 16-18 of the Note p. 28. ' Ali Jahman . . . rode far ahead gossiping about his experiences on a recent tax collecting expedition to the south-eastern distiicts along the fiontier of Oman. ... 1 was interested to hear from him that Ibn Sa ud s influence is felt to-day in all the Dhahira country, as they call the tract westward ot the Oman Massif, including, of course, Buraimi, a Wahhabi centre of long stanc nig, and apparently even Ibri.

Consequent on the recent investigations i llto ^ebrua^v to Sir Percy Cox was good enough to come to the In rnnfidential No. 143 discuss the conversations reported in Colonel Dickson b c espa c , ,, . g'j -J •of 4th July, to have taken place between Sir Percy, Ibn Saud and Major Holmes November/December 1922.10 2. Sir Percy Cox said that he had kept no private notes as to what passed at hi* meeting with Ibn Saud on the occasion in question. Anything he had reported or recorded on the subject would have been left on record at Baghdad; but to the- best of his recollection and belief the facts and circumstances were as follows; — 3. The specific object with which, accompanied by Iraq representatives, he went to meet Ibn Saud at Ojair was to induce him to i&lt;itiJy the ■Mohaminenih, Agreement of 5th May 1922. Sir Percy proceeded to the rendezvous without any knowledge that he would there meet Major Holmes or would have occasion to express any opinion as to the boundaries of the Qatar 1 eninsula; hut learning from Major Flohnes, and from the map that he produced, that he was endeavouring to obtain from Ibn Saud a concession for exploiting oil in an area which included the Qatar Peninsula, he (Sir Percy Cox) naturally informed Major Holmes—and no doubt Ibn Saud also—that this could not be. If he had then been asked, as he doubtless must have been, what he considered should be excluded, as constituting Qatar, Sir Percy would undoubtedly have based his answer on his own knowledge, as Resident in the Persian Gulf for many years, namely, that, on the east coast, Qatar's boundary with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi's, territory was the head of the Khor-al-'Odaid, and on the west coast the head of Salwa Bay. This, in Sir Percy's recollection, was the position recognised in the Bushire Residency and adopted by Lorimer in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer. Sir Percy probably had the Gazetteer with him, but on the above point he would hardly have needed to consult it. In any case he is positive that the Anglo-Turkish Blue Line of 1913 was never mentioned, and is of opinion that any view which he expressed incidentally and ex tempore could not reasonably be regarded as the official pronouncement of the Hasa-Qatar boundary contemplated in our first treaty with Ibn Saud (December 1915) in which it figured as one of those to be ' hereafter determined.' Moreover, Sir Percy Cox states that he informed both Ibn Saud and Major Holmes that His Majesty's Government ought to be consulted before any concession was granted. 4. Sir Percy said that in these circumstances it seemed to him that His Majesty's Government were entirely free, in so far as the conversations of 1922 were concerned, to maintain against Ibn Saud the Blue Line of the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as the eastern boundary of Nejd. 5. Sir Percy said he was not aware whether either Ibn Saud or the Sheikh of Qatar had ever advanced a definite claim to the ownership of the Barr-al-Qarah coastal tract, between Zaklmuniyeh and Salwa, but it seemed to him that if occasion arose in the future for a compromise it would be a reasonable course to assign to Ibn Saud, in view of his strong position at Ojair close by, that length of coast line with its hinterland, up to the Blue Line. This would have the advantage of leaving no indeterminate area along the sea-coast.

I My dear Laithwaite, as arranged in our telephone conversations, I write in regard to the air facilities which are essential at atar if it is to be possible for the BJUF. to carry out their part in implementing a guarantee of protection to the Sheikh. You will remember that we agreed in the Middle East Official Gornmittee that it was not necessary to complicate the ■ draft telegram itself which we prepared for Cabinet approval ^ with the details of these facilities and that we considered it sufficient for our purposes in this telegram merely to refer to : them briefly and generally and deal with the details separately. I After considering again the papers already sent to the Resident, Persian Gulf, demi-officially, including our demi- v' v official letter of the 29th January, 3,32797, I feel that our original view that Fowle already had full details is not, in fact, quite substantiated, especially in regard to the vitally important point of intelligence and I feel that in order to fulfil our intention to give him all necessary details of facilities required, it is necessary to send him a further telegram amplifying the brief reference in paragraph 3 of the draft wire, detailing the facilities required, and making quite clear that the grant of these facilities by the Sheikh is an essential condition of our giving an undertaKing oi protection# These points are, of course, quite well understood over here by us who have taken part in the deliberations, but I am not sure that, as the papers sent to Fowle stand, our intentions would be/ Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, S J.l.be equally clear to him, I should, therefore, be most grateful if you would consider the terms of a telegram to be sent to him, and it should, I suggest, be sent concurrently with the draft telegram. I attach a suggested draft for you to think over. -I- -a- -sugges -ted -dmit- -fox- yxm -to. -think- -oror. As you know, we attach the highest importance to these facilities, especially that of an intelligence officer, without which we could not take our part in implementing any guarantee. The defence methods which we have to use make it necessary to secure the earliest warning of impending major raids and this requires an intelligence officer in close touch with the tribes and free to move among them and with wireless communications. Such officers have always been maintained wherever these laethods of defence have been used, in Iraq, Trans Jordan, Aden and A elsewhere. I feel that the wire should also stress to the Resident that the agreement of H.M.G. has been given only on the condition that these facilities are obtained. These points were emphasised by the Chiefs of &gt;taff (seej for instance, paragraphs 8 and 9 of their report G.I.Paper 1129-B and conclusion feu) There is a danger that in our anxiety not to complicate the draft wire which the Cabinet would have to consider, we may overlook the necessity for making quite clear to Powle that the facilities are an essential condition and I am quite sure that unless we send him a telegram on these lines, we should noo be certain of ensuring that the terms recommended by the Ohiefs of Btaff, upon which the Cabinet agreed to approve the acceptance of this commitment, are complied with. I am sending copies of this letter to Mendel at the Foreign ;| Office and Seal at the Admiralty. lours sincerely, (Bgd). Pdchard Peck.DRAFT TlilL^Ar. In amplification of paragraph 3 of my immediately preceding telegram (the draft wire submitted to Cabinet), particulars of the facilities required by the R.A.F. to enable them to implement guarantee are as follows. Two landing grounds, storage facilities, e.g. petrol dump, bomb store, moorings; freedom to use w /T and permission for R .A.F. intelligence officer to reside in Qatar if necessary and in any event to have freedom for himself or his assistants to move about the country. The grant of protection to the Sheikh would be conditional upon his consent to these facilitie Above amplifies D.O. letter sent you under reference (the Air Ministry D.O. letter of 29/l to . r.Laithwaite under reference S.32797. ) I assume serious difficulty need not be anticipated in event of guarantee of protection being given, but would be glad of your views on important question of relation of intelligence officer if appointed to Resident with a view to agreement on this point with Air Ministry.No. C/ 218 Political Agency, Bahrain.

With reference to Article 10 of the Qatr Agreement it was agreed at our meeting on 13tli March that your negotiators might be authorised, if necessary, to compound with the Sheikh for exemption from taxation, in which case the words 'food supplies' might 'be omitted from paragraph S of the Article, but i thought that the understanding was that the words should for the present be left in. In any case would not the end of paragraph 1 be a more appropriate place for the second sentence of paragraph 2 of the article? 2, i enclose six copies of the provisional draft of the Government Agreement for Q,atr.
