D.O.No. 277.0436 / British Agency, ^Sharjah. Bated 25th March, 1948• Please refer to your demi-official letter lTo.C/195 dated the 12th February, 1 am afraid my reply has been held up by the delay in getting new plans made of the build ings to be retained by the R*A.F. 2. Your paragraph 3: ^As* far as I can gather locally the requirements for civil aviation are as stated in the Secretary of State’s letter. In addition, 1 understand, the signals and navigational aids here are now being run by International Air Radio and the R,A,P, together; out tnat the intention is that they will gradually be taken over by International Air Radio and manned by Civilian personnel serving both R.A.F. and Commercial aircraft. International Air Radio, who have now entirely replaced B.O.A.C’s ioimer signals organisation here, are still handling commercial messages as a Agents of Cable and Wireless, as B.O.A.C. were. It would appear that the Shaikh’s consent to the operation of these commercial signal services (as opposed to those required to the operation of aircraft) should be obtained. The R.A.F. here do not know what buildings are to be retained, but they have received general instructions not to repair any buildings not at present &gt; llkely to be needed in the near future. Ihe plan^you sent include5 many buildings (the levy lines for instance) not included in the list enclosed with the Secretary of State’s letter. I enclose two copies of an up-to-date plan prepared ov/he Air Ministry Works Directorate showing in red the buddings mentioned in the list as 'required'and in blue tho^/ described Confidential.

Pelly&gt; Esquire, O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain^ BAHRAIN RECEIPT. f /Yi2 as Surplus completed buildings.’ I agree with you that the payments listed in the column *under consideration for future 1 in your statement are those which we ought to offer for a new air agreeme ntTj hut I would add that, if this agreement is to cover both Civil and H.A.P* require- which ments, perhaps the pay of the extra guards for the appear to have taken on in accordance with Wakefieldls p ns letter No. 25 dated the 1st ReTSruary, 1942, should be paid from the same source as the 37 guards provided for in the 1932 civilian agreement, and not separately as hitherto. Against this is the consideration that when their committ ments are reduced the R.A.F. may wish to reduce the number of extra guards employed by them. At present we are free to do so by negotiation with the Shaikh, for nowhere do we appear to have undertaken in writing to employ any specific number of extra guards. It might, therefore, be an advantage to retain the existing differentiation between the two lots of guards to facilitate future reduction. My express letter Uo. 274 dated the 24th Mexch / refers. £ 3. Your paragraph 4: I enclose a-ete future air agreement. In it I have included provisonally /fX t for the 71 guards and 4 head guards, which is the total of the 37 agreed to in the sivil air agreement fn 1932 and of the 38 additional guards at present employed by the R.A.R. for their camp. It is also for consideration whether the dearness allowances for the guards sanctioned, temporarily in your predecessor’s letter No. C/545 of the 25th May, 1946, should be retained as dearness allowances subject to reduction, or should be consolidated with the basic pay. I consider they should be retained as dearness allowances subject to reduction if prices fall; becaie e, if the reverse takes place, the Shaikh w r ill certainely ask for an increase whether the allowances are consolidated with the pay or not. I have included in the draft the other payments mentioned in your statement in the column ’under consideration for future’. I have omitted many clauses- 3 - &gt;e&gt;' J 3- from the 1932 agreement which are nov; redundant: notably that part of sub-clause 4 of the first paragraph^which forbids personnel and passengers at the air station to enter the town of Sharjah without the Shaikh’s permission. I have not included a clause in the snnse of your letter Ho. C/204 dated the 16th February, 1948, making it encumbent the Shaikh to refund the cost of stolen equipment from ^ cl ' the payments he receives, because, to do so, might mitigate v ' ' 1 against his signing the agreement; but I intend to establish the precedent to continue to act upon it. His acceptance of full responsibility in general terms gives us, I think, every right to do this. I have suggested 10 years as the period of validity of the new agreement. I have inserted a provision (arjrticle 8) giving the Political Resident the right to arbitrate in a. dispute or appoint arbitrators. You may wish to revise this before it is proposed to the Shaikh. 4. 0 ^ serve ^ rom t* 16 penultimate paragraph of the 1932 agreement that three months 1 notice is to be given if it is desired to renew the agreement. This notice should be given not later than the 22nd April, 1948; and I would suggested that I should be authorized as soon as possible to give this notice. 5 # The enclosures to your demi-official letter under reply are returned.A Agreement between Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr, Ruler of Sharjah, and the British Government for the maintenance of an Air Station at Sharjah, It having been intimated to me Sultan bin jhltv Saqr, of Sharjah and its dependencies by- Li eutenanct Colonel Sir Rupert Hay, K7.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, that the High British Government desire to maintain an air station at Sharjah and all the signalling, navigation al, meteorological, and other ancillary facilities necessary for the operation of aircraft, I hereby agree to grant to the High British Government and or its duly appointed agents the following facilities: (i) Exclusive occupation of and right to opera.te, maintain, and use the existing landing ground, camp, rest house, buildings, meteorological, navigational, signalling, and landing installations, including the existing navigational, signalling, and landing installations and water wells situated outside the perimeter of the camp and landing ground and the connections between these installations.

Bahrain receipt/. / n N®...JL£4.....Datei^*n&gt;tz£x kM^ia Dated the 24th April f 1948 Sir *ith reference to my Savingram No.6 (81/87) dated the 17th April in which 1 reported that 1 had authorised the Political Agent Bahrain to give the Shaikh of Sharjah notice of the renewal of the existing air agreement I have the honour to forward herewith the draft of the new Civil Air Agreement which 1 propose should be negotiated with the Shaikh together with drafts of letters to be exchanged regarding facilities for the Royal Air Force^ . ^ ^ 2. The existing air agreement was drawn up in 1932 and granted facilities only to the Imperial Airways Company (subsequently changed to the British Overseas Airways Corporation). In the present draft the facilities are described as being granted to His Majesty's Government as it is uncertain whether the B.O.A.C. will wish to continue to maintain their station at Sharjah. As the old agreement is somewhat antiquated in form and incomplete 1 have modelled the new agreement on the Heads of Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Shaikh of Kuwait in the existing Kuwait Civil Air Agreement which was concluded in 1934. The Hoyal Air Force at present enjoy facilities at Sharjah as a result of correspondence exchanged with the Shaikh in 1944 vide Shaikh of Sharjah's letter No.272'dated the 13th April, 1944 to Political Agent Bahrain (enclosed with Residency Memorandum No.C/22 dated the 1st March 1945^0 the late India Office). I propose that these facilities /Should be governed in future by the exchange of letters the drafts of which are forwarded herewith. In the other Gulf States R.A.F^ facilities are not provided for in the regular air agreement but are governed by an exchange of letters in the manner now proposed and in case it is at any time desired to publish the general air agreement I recommend that the practice should be followed In the present case. If however His Majesty's Government so desire it would be possible to include provision for facilities for the R.A.F. in fche general air agree- 3. The following commentA are in explanation of certain Article 3 » The Shaikh was informed in 1946 that Hi* Majesty's Government would in future in view of their obligations under the Chicago Convention grant permission on the Shaikh's behalf to foreign aircraft to use the aerodrome and the Shaikh acknowledged receipt of this communication vide enclosures to Residency Memorandum No.568-S dated the 7th Slay 1946 to the late India Office. The present article is intended to cover this. 1 also consider it unnecessary, unless the Shaikh insists, to obtalJ his agreement to detailed conditions relating to the use of the aerodrome such as are contained in Parts I and III of the Kuwait Civil Air Agreement and hope he will agree to leave this matter entirely to His Majesty's Government. The article has been draft ed accordingly. Under the 1932 Agreement the Shaikh was entitled to a fee of Ps.S for every commercial aeroplane that landed on the aerodrome. This was increased to Rs.10 with effect from the 1st January 1946 vide correspondence resting with the late India Office telegram No.9381 dated the 18th May 1946. -n The Shaikh will cert ainly not agree to forego this fee and may /even ask for it to be Increased. It will be noted that provision has been made for His Majesty's Government to recover fees and I see no reason why features of the draft which are peculiar to Sharjahi The Ft. Hon. Ernest Bevin, P.C., etc. etc. etc., t Bevin, P.C., M»P*, etc. etc., The Foreign Office,they should not recover these at the recognised rates vide Notice to Airmen No*98 of 1946 and Notice to Airmen No.168 of 1946 and keep for themselves what is left over after paying to the Shaikh Article S i Article 6 has been framed so as to cover the operation of the wireless station for ordinary civil traffic as well as for traffic relating to aircraft. The station has been so used since 1933 by agreement between Imperial Airways Limited (later B.O.A.C) and Cable and Wireless c.f* India Office Economic and Overseas Department letter No•4543/36 dated the 1st August 1936. The Shaikh did not give his consent to this arrangement until 1937 and then demanded a number of concessions such as the free trans mission of his personal messages which were refused him. It is possible he may renew his demands*^ / n With reference to India Office Express Letter No.JSxt. 1359/47 dated the 26th June 1947 it is understood that International Aeradio have now entirely replaced the B.O.A^s signals organisation at Sharjah and are handling commercial messages as agents of Cable and Wireless. This cnange has not been officially notified to this Besidency. It is further understood that International Aeradio and the Loyal Air Force are serving aircraft jointly so far as signals and navigational aids are concerned but the intention is that the whole organisation will in due course be taken over by International Aeradip and manned by civilian personnel serving both R.A.K. and commercial aircraft. 3o long as the wireless station continues to be available for local private and commercial traffic it would appear to make little difference whether it is run by the B.O.A.C. or International Aeradio or Cable and Wireless. If the Shaikh accepts the Article as drafted Cable and Wireless should be able to take over the station in due course as agents of His Majesty’s Government if so desired, without obtaining any separate concession from the Shaikh Article The rates are those provided for in the 1932 Agreement plus dearness allowance of Bs.15 per head tfhich has been paid since 1st January 1946 vide sanction conveyed Jin India Office telegram No.9381 dated the 18th Kay, 1846. ^ $ article IQilD i The rent for the air station was fixed at Rs.800 per raonth in 1932 and was increased to Bs.lOOG per month with effect from the 1st January 1946. It is possible that the Shaikh may ask for more. Article lQ(ill) i The rate of rent for tne Best House and the condition attached to it is as provided for in the 1932 Agree ment. The amount advanced will be recovered in full by ©bout early 1966. It is probable that the Shaikh will haggle over this Article .1,0 (Iv ) i The personal subsidy was fixed at ^s.600 per month in the 1932 agreement and raised to Fs.800 per ^onth with c effect from the 1st January 1946 vide India Office telegram No.9381 dated 18th Aay 1946 referred to above. The bhaikh has been press ing for a further increase in his subsidy vide paragrgr'pn 2 of my Express Letter No.326-8 dated the 17th February 1947 and may not be content with the additional Fs.200 proposed. If there is any likelihood of the agreement being published it is for consideration whether the subsidy should not either (a) be covered by a separate exchange of letters or (b) be added to the rent provided for in Article 10(11). remain in force for 10 years but should see no objection if His Majesty 1 s Government prefer it to be made for a shorter or longer period. 4. With regard to the draft of the letters which it is propose should be exchanged regarding B.a.F. facilities the first point for the sums due under this Article Article arid it may in any case be necessary to state which rent will become payable. ^ v/\* X have suggested that the Agreement should /ccnsideration.•.3 V' ( 3 &gt; consideration is the area required by the K*A % F» €.f* paragraph 5 of India Office Express letter No.Ext*1359/47 dated 26th June 1947 I forward herewith up to date plana prepared by the Air ministry’s Works Directorate showing in red the buildings mentioned In the list accompanying the Express Letter Just referred to as H Fequired” and in blue those described as 'surplus completed buildings'• There are a certain number of buildings in the plan e.g.the Levy Lines which are not included in the list referred to* The F*A*F• at Sharjah have received instructions not to repair any buildings which are not at present in use or likely to be required in the near future. It Is presumed that whether the R.A.F. propose to keep the buildings in repair or not they wish to retain the whole of the area J shown in the plan. It will be noticed that in the draft reference is made to a map signed by the Shaikh on the 13th April 1944. I have not a copy of this map on record and do not know if the limits of the P.A.F. camp shown in it correspond exactly with those shown on the plans which form an enclosure to this despatch. I am taking * steps to verify this point and will report further. 5. The second point to be considered Is the amount of rent to be paid for the area. I have proposed that this should be fixed at fcs.5C0 per month but it remains to be seen whetner the Shaikh will accept this. X have been ursable to ascertain the acreage of the FuA.F. camp but it must I think be larger than that of the area of the air station for which the Shaikh is being paid Fs.lOCC per month. In the event of his accepting the figure proposed X would ask for authority to pay him immediately what is due to him from the date of the cessation of hostilities with Japan viz. 16th August* 1946 vide paragraph 6 of India Office Express Letter fro.Ext.1369/47 dated 26th June 1947 up to the last day of the month preceding his 6* The Shaikh may ask for a reaffirmatlop^of the contents of the letter written to him by Colonel Dickson when the original fcgreeri\ent was concluded in 1932 copy enclosed for ready reference X should be grateful for afethorlty to give him the assurance in writing that the undertakings it contains will continue to be obser ved f if I find this necessary.

As a less imprecise and better worded our document I think your draft agreement is an improvement on Jacksons.

I afterwards learned from our agents at Sharjah, Khan Saheb Ahmed Hussain &amp; All Abdulla Awazl, that we had until now been exempt from duty on Aviation products by reason of a thirteen-year-old and recently-expired agreement between, presumably, the Khan Saheb and Col.

To, The Political Agent, Bahrain. MEMORANDUM: Reference your printed letter No.4856-30/20 dated the 15th October, 1948. 2. According to Clause 3 of the Civil Air Agreement made between His Majesty*s Government and the Shaikh of Sharjah on the 22nd July, 1932, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (known then as the Imperial Airways Company) had the right to import petrol for their aircraft free of duty. No customs duty has so far been paid by either the British Overseas Airways Corporation or the B.P. Aviation Service on aviation spirit used for the British Overseas Airways Corporation as well as other civil aircraft landing in Sharjah. The Shaikh now demands a customs duty of on aviation products used for all the British Overseas Airways Cor poration as well as civil aircraft (R.A.k. aircraft are exempt). He bases his demand on the fact that the British Overseas Airways Corporation are not importing aviation spirit but are buying it from B.P. Aviation Service and that as the Shaikh of Dubai levies customs duty on aviation spirit used for civil aircraft there is no reason why he should not do so. ^ 3. The agreement referred to in the penultimate paragraph of the enclosure to your letter under reference is the Sharjah Civil Air Agreement concluded between His Majesty*s Government and the Shaikh of Sharjah on the 22nd July, 1932.No.C/L-180. POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 8th November, 1948 (g) \ V The Branch Manager, B.P. Aviation Service, Bahrain. Dear Sir, Please refer to your letter No.33/2426, dated the 21st September, 1948, on the subject of the demand for customs duty made by the Shaikh of Sharjah. 2. The relevant clause in the Civil Air Agreement concluded in 1932 between His Majesty’s Government and the Shaikh of Sharjah for the establishment of an air station at Sharjah reads as follows: 'The Company (i.e. the then Imperial Airways) shall have the right to import, free of duty, petrol and spare parts for aircraft, provisions for the passengers and staff, and whatever nay be required for their service.' 3. It is in compliance with this proviso that the Shaikh has refrained from charging duty on petrol sup plied for the aircraft of B.O.A.C. (as successors of Imperial Airways), and he seems to have extended the concession to petrol supplied for ALL civil aircraft.

It may be that you will have to continue any existing accounting arrangements you may have with scheduled operators but we will leave this question to you to arrange in the light of local conditions. as Bell mentioned in his letter of 25th Auguet, we consider that in view of the small number of landings the collection of fees should not prove onerous and should be undertaken by the existing staff. The revenue would not justify any increase in personnel. Yours sincerely, Sgd. (L.O. Jones) J.H.B. Gowan Ssq., International aC radio ltd., 4, Hill St., London W.l.

My despatches referred toyin the first enclosure were forwarded to you under my'D.O. No. B/52(81/8?) of 24th April and letter No. 44/847-3(81/87) of 6 th May endorsement. 2. The only suggestions I h^ve to make regarding the draft received from His Majesty’s O-overnment are that the term 'His Excellency' as anplied to the Shaikh of Sharjah should be omitted throughout and that in Article 4 ,l the Political Agent' should be inserted before the 'Political Officer Trucial Co^st' and substituted for 'Political Officer' at the end of the article. This is to allow for the possible appointment of a Political Agent to the Trucial Coast in the not too distant future. I am of the opinion that these changes can be made without any reference to His Majesty’s G-overnment. 3 . I should be grateful if you would kindly make suggestions regarding the completion of Article 10(iii). 4. It will be noted, vide paragraph 5 of the first enclosure, that the m^p to be attached to the letter to the Shaikh about Royal Air Force facilities is still awaited. I see no objection however to negotiations for the new agreement being initiated before this map arrives. 5. With regard to the comments ingparagraoh 2 of your D.O letter No. C/R-l of the 1st May 7 I consider it desirable that you should if possible get all the provisions concerned embodied in the agreement. If however either now or later you think we shall be well advised to omit one or more of them, you will no doubt make a recommendstion to me accordingly. Similarly, we might, I think, include the additions suggested in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office despatch if we find it possible. 6 . Please forward to me at earlv date any comments or suggestions you may have to make and let me know when and how you propose thrt negotiations for the new agreement should be initia ted.V* CONFIDENTIAL % Copy of Foreign Cffice despatch No.60(W 57/29/3/802) of 19th November to Sir Rupert Hay, KCIECSI»« Bahrain. I have the honour to refer to your despatch No.25(81/87) of 24th April with which you forwarded your proposals for the renewal of the Civil Air Agreement with the Shaikh of Sharjah and to your despatch No. 44/847-3(81/87) concerning maps in connexion with the Agreement. 2 . I concur generally with your proposals, and you should at your discretion seek a renewal of the Air Agreement from the Shaikh for a period of ten years. I note that your drafts were modelled on the Kuwait Civil Air Agreement of 1934. In connexion with the renewal of that agreement, however, a redraft bringing it into line with modern requirements has been under consideration here for some time. A redraft of the Sharjah Air Agreement on similar lines together with a redraft of the letters regarding facilities for the Royal Air Force are enclosed, which, if you see no objection, you should present to the Shaikh. 3. You will see that the redraft of the Agreement follows your draft in being concerned only with the present aerodrome at Sharjah. In your draft exchange of letters you speak of ‘'the use of any aerodrome which may be established'. If you consider that the Agreement should similarly cover the contingency of the establishment of additional aerodromes, the following additions should be made to the redraft. Article 10. Line 2. 'Insert 'existing' between 'the' and 'aerodrome'. Article 11. After 'Sharjah' add 'and any other aerodrome in the territory of His Excellency the Shaikh which may be established hereafter by His Majesty's Government in Agreement with His Excellency the Shaikh'. 4. The following comments are in explanation of points of detail raised in your despatch of 24th April. Article 3 . I agree that it is unnecessary, unless the Shaikh insists, to obtain his agreement to detailed conditions relating to the use of the aerodrome such as are contained in parts I and III of the Kuwait Civil Air Agreement. / Article 5 . I agree that this article should be drafted in such a way that Cable and Wireless may at any time take over the wireless station as agents of His Majesty's Government without obtaining separate concessions from the Shaikh. Article 6 . Your proposals concerning the recovery of landing fees are acceptable but His Majesty's Government cannot agree to any increase in the fee of 1C Rupees at present paid to the Shaikh in respect of every commercial aircraft making a landing. Article 10(1) . The Treasury wish you to confirm that no fall in the cost of living has taken place since the allowance of 15 Rupees per head wassanctioned in 1946. Article 10(11) ....Article 10(11) . Your despatch No. 82/ S of 5th January 1946 stated that the increase in the rent of the Air Station from 800 Rupees to 1,000 Rupees was partly accounted for by the inclusion of the area occupied by the Royal Air Force camp. Now that 500 Rupees is to be paid as rent for that camp, there is a case for a decrease amounting to atleast part of the 200 Rupees increment of 1946. Since, however, the area of the Air Station appears to have increased considerably since 1932 and since any attempt to reduce the rent would not be acceptable to the Shaikh, it has not been considered worth while to press for such a reduction. You might if necessary, however, make use of the argument to refute any claim by the Shaikh for an increase. Article 10(iii) . I leave it to your discretion whether you state the date from which the rent for the rest-house would become payable. Article 10(iv) . The Treasury are prepared to approve the additional 200 Rupees proposed by you, bringing the total sum upto 1,000 Rupees. They cannot agree to any further increase. 5. With regard to the exchange of letters which it is proposed to include regarding the Royal Air Force facilities, the Aii* Ministry agree that the area shown on the plan enclosed in your despatch meets their requirements. The are now preparing an accurate map for attachment to your letter to the Shaikh, and this will be forwarded to you as soon as it is ready. They regret that they cannot provide a map showing accurately the limits of the Civil Air Station. In any case it might be preferable in discussions with the Shaikh to avoid any delimination of the area of the Civil Air Station as this might lead to claims for increase in rent in the event of extensions to runways. 6 . The Air Ministry agree to a rent of upto 500 Rupees per month, and give authority for the immediate payment of the total amount due between 15th August 1945 and the last day of the month preceding the Shaikh*s acceptance of the agreement. They agree also to the payments to the two head guards few 4fee and the 36 guards (I assume that the guards for the Royal Air Force camp are in addition to the guards for the Civil Air Station referred to in Article 10(i) of the agreement). 7. I have no objection to a re-confirmation to the Shaikh, if he so requests, of the contents of Colonel Dickson*s letter at the time of the conclusion of the original agreement.

We have reconsidered our decision on the form of the Sharjah Civil Air Agreement. Since the arrangement is not an international agreement withing the meaning of the United Nations Charter we think the draft forwarded to you is nossibly too formal and have therefore decided to revert to “heads of agreement 1 * the form proposed by you. 2.

Dear Sir Rupert, V y Stobart has suggested that Article 5 (2) in the draft Sharjah Air Agreement received with your semi official letter No.(49/12/48), dated the 10th December, 1948, might be omitted; as the right to wireless to and from aircraft appears too fine a point to raise in an Agreement with a Trucial Shaikh: I agree. 2. I think Article 10 (iii) might be completed in the same way as in the draft forwarded to Mr. Bevin with your letter No.25, dated the 24th April, 1948. There seems no necessity for giving a firm date as from which rent for the rest house will be paid. 3. I would like now to get a translation made of the draft with Article 5 (2) omitted and Article 10 (iii) completed, as suggested, and to send it to Stobart asking him to get the Shaikh's acceptance to it. Being what he is, Sultan bin Saqr is bound to argue and bargain, even if pleased with the terms, in the first place. Stobart can deal with him about the details and let me know when agreement, or agreement upon conditions, has teen reached. I will then try to get the Shaikh's signature after re ference to you, if necessary.

Deer Pelly, I have now studied the Residency Agent's memorandum No.9.0243 of 3rd January 1949 which I seem unfortunately to have missed seeing before my departure from Bahrain on 7th January. 2 . I think that the travel ban has had a salutary and sobering effect upon the Shaikh of Sharjah, and that it has caused him considerable discomfort, as also unfortunately, to his subjects, who in the present depressed conditions here, must need travel in search of work elsewhere. 3. As there now appears to be some sign of a rea sonable attitude on the Shaikh's part, I would suggest that it might be gracious to lift the travel ban and to make the outstanding air facilities payments. The best time for this might well be after the signing of .the new air agreement. I see no objection to using Sultan bin Saqr's restoration to grace as a deliberate incentive to cooperate over this agreement. 4. Provided the necessary Arabic translation is forthcoming, I should like to put the preliminary negotiations in hand at once, as I believe that the psychological moment has arrived for them.

Stobart, the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, Sharjah. (K'V After Compliments. I have gone through the draft agreement which is to be renewed now concerning the Civil Air Station and found it to be unacceptable and liable to great modification. The first agreement is preferable to this from various aspects taking into consideration the circumstances under which it was concluded. I, therefore, request you to give favourable consideration to my coments s- (1) The first agreement was conejuded at a time when cost of living and other essential requirements were low and before the world developments and changes. Now as conditions have actively changed from what they were before, it is necessary to give consideration to these changes. (2) Also during the time agreement was concluded buildings were not erected and the area was not delineated. Colonel Biscoe used to describe the matter to me as very simple; but it appeared to me very clearly to be the opposite, I, however, observed my obligations to the High British not Government as it has/been my habit to act otherwise I as well as my ancestors have always preferred all along to observe and respect agreements and obligations entered into between us and the High British Government even if such agreements and obligations are prejudicial to our interests. We believe that the High British Government's aim is to administer right justice and equity. (3) The rent fixed for the rest house i.e., the previous place in which the passengers are accommodated which is Rs. 300/- is so small that it ■ . ./eveneven does not represent the rent of an ordinary house in the town. The reason why I accepted Es. 300/- in the first agreement is because the British Government took upon themselves payment of building and other expenditure without charging interests for the money. They also supplied on my behalf all the iron windows etc. In this agreement, however, there is nothing of this sort and therefore this must be taken into account and given due consideration, (4) There is a further remark, i.e., no rent has been mentioned for the additional building added to the rest house in the agreement. (5) The abovementioned remarks is very important and I request you to give it due attention, (6) I cannot agree to the pay for the guards as it is small. During the time the first agreement was coneluded a labourer used to get from As. -/8/- to He. 1/- p.d. but now wages of labourers hatoe gone up and a labourer now gets from the companies in Qatar, Kuwait etc., not less than Es. 10/- p.d. When the Company start work on this side a labourer will demand more than this. This concerns an ordinary labourer who works for a limited time. People left here in search of work. A guard who carries out his duties and shoulders respensibilties by day and night should be given sufficient wages and this is to be decided in the light of this difference. (7) The personal subsidy is very small. In the past I contented myself with it as the State had a large income out of pearl trade, diving and customs. Attention should, however, be paid to the fact that the principal pearl trade has fallen down, income from customs .../decreased3 decreased and expenses increased due to the present developments* (8) Also the hire of (R.A.F.) Camp the area of which has been extended from time to time is negligible. (9) The rent of Ks* 500/- which you contemplate fixing for all the present R.A.F. buildings which occupy a large plot of land as pointed out to you in my previous letters, you are fully aware that this rent is not even sufficient for one building out of those numerous buildings and constructions. (10) The fee in respect of the landing of aircraft should be increased to a reasonably fair figure. I request you to send me a reply to what I mentioned. Usual Ending.© CONFIDENTIAL . No.C/R-63.

The pay of the guards was originally fixed at fis.40 per month for the head guard and 8s.20 per month for the other guards. An allowance of Rs.5 was added in 1944 and this was increased to Rs.15 in 1946 vide this Residency express letter No. 82-S of the 15th January, 1946, and India Office telegram No. 8532 of the 5th May, 1946 (copies enclosed for ready reference). Prices have risen substantially since the last increase of pay and the Shaikh says that he is unable to enlist men at the present rate. Guards employed by the Royal Air Force on their own account and by the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, are paid 8s.45 per month and the oil company pay their guards at 8s.2 per day for the first two years and after that at Rs.2/8/- per day. Encouraged by this, the Shaikh has asked for Rs.80 per month which is slightly in excess of the maximum oil company rate. My own view is that an increase of pay is justified and that a reasonable rate would be Ks.70 per month for a head guard and fis.50 per month for an ordinary guard. It may be difficult, however, to persuade the Shaikh to accept this as the oil company pay their guards a minimum of Rs.60 per month. I would suggest that I be authorised to negotiate with the Shaikh on this subject and obtain the best terms possible between the limits of 8s.80 arid Ks.65 per month for a head guard and Bs.60 and Rs.45 per month for an ordinary guard, a suitable proportion of the amount fixed to be described as basic pay, and the rest as dearness allowance which would be subject to variation on the basis of the local cost of living. 4. With regard to the rent of the Rest-house, this was fixed at fis.300 per month in 1932. The Shaikh claims additional rent partly because the size of the ReAst-house was doubled in 1937 and partly owing to the rise in prices and rents generally. The oil company for instance are paying Es.700 per 2 During my recent visit to the Trucial Coast The Rt. Hon. Ernest Bevin, M.P., etc., etc., etc., Foreign Office, London. month for a I- 2 - month for a house in Sharjah much smaller than the Rest-house. When it was proposed to extend this in 1937, the Shaikh agreed on condition that (a) the cost of additional accommodation would not be recoverable from him and (b) that the additional building would become his property if we ever gave up the Station. We made no condition as in the case of the original building tnat the cost of the extension should be set off against a fixed rent. Had this been done, there would probably be some years to run yet before the cost would be completely recovered and the Shaikh is not in very strong grounds in asking for additional rent on account of this extension. Cn the other hand, he is certainly entitled to ask for an increase of rent for the original building and might well be able to obtain Bs. 1,000 per month for it if he were at liberty to lease it# I suggest that I be authorised to offer him a rent of Bs.600 per month for the whole building in the first place and that I should be given discretion to go up to Rs. 1,000 per month if I find this necessary. According to our records, the cost of the original building was Bs.70,929 and we estimate that on the 1st May, 1949, a balance of Rs.20,529 will still be due from the Shaikh. Even if the rent is increased to Bs.1,000 per month it will be nearly two years before this is paid off. 5. The Shaikh signed his letter in my presence and immediately- raised two additional points. He asked whether it was not usual for some consideration to be paid to a Gulf Ruler in return for the right to send and receive commercial telegrams. I replied that so far as I was av.are this was not the case. He then asked if he could not be permitted to send telegrams free of charge. I replied that this might be possible and that I would look into the matter. I find that the Rulers of Kuwait and Bahrain are permitted to send private messages free of charge to the extend of 1,500 and 3,000 words respectively irrespective of class and destination under their agreements with Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited. I would accordingly suggest that if a satisfactory arrangement is reached with the Snaikh in respect of the matters discussed above, I should be authorised to inform him in writing that private messages will be accepted from him and transmitted free of charge up to a limit of 3,000 words annually irrespective of class and destination. 6 . The Shaikh*s second request was that he might be supplied with rifles and ammunition for his guards. He was given 37 rifles in 1932 when the original Air Agreement was signed and these have by this time become unserviceable. There is nothing on record to show whether he was given any additional rifles in January 1942 when the guards for the Royal Air Force camp were first employed. I suggest that he should now be given free of charge 74 rifles for the 74 guards with say, 100 rounds per rifle. 7 . I have not yet received the map to be attached to the letter regarding Royal Air Force facilities, vide paragraph 5 of your despatch under reply, and I should be gratelul ii this could kindly be forwarded to me at an early date. 8 . I note that in your telegram of the 23rd November you assume that the new Agreement when ready will be signed by the Political Resident personally. The original Air Agreement with the Shaikh of Sharjah was signed by the Political Resident himselfwmmmmmm SMflHHHHHI - 3 - Resident himself as he was then directly responsible for Trucial Coast affairs. The current Bahrain and Kuwait Air Agreements were signed by the Political Agents and I should be grateful for confirmation that I may authorise the Political Agent, Bahrain, to sign the new Sharjah Air Agreement if it is not convenient for me to do so myself. » 9. I am proposing to omit the style M His Excellency” as applied to the Shaikh of Sharjah in the draft Heads of Agreement received from' you as he has not been accorded this title. I also propose in Article 4 to insert “the Political Agent” before ”the Political Officer Trucial Coast” and to substitute 'Political Agent” for 'Political Officer, Trucial Coast” at the end of the Article. This is desirable both because in present circumstances the office of the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, is often vacant for months on end and also because it is hoped that in due course there will be a Political Agent resident on the Trucial Coast. I presume that there is no objection to these minor amendments. 10 . I should be grateful if you could kindly let me have authority to proceed on the lines proposed in this despatch as soon as possible. The Shaikh of Sharjah is an unreliable person and may well go back on his acceptance of the bulk of the terms proposed if he finds an opportunity for doing so. The sooner, therefore, we can conclude the negotiations with him, the better. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant, r (Sign*#) W. R. BAY. RS.COPY GOVERNMENT OF INDIA EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL) No•82-S PENSION GULF RESIDENCY, BUSHIRE, CONFIDENTIAL . 15th January 1946 Retaxandum London* Foreign New Delhi* Air Officer Comranding, Paiforce. Political Bahrain. The Shaikh of Sharjah recently refused acceptance of the payments for June and July due to hi® under the Shar jah Air Agreement of 22nd July 1932* Following a visit by the Political Agent, Bahrain, he accepted payment and has now written requesting an increase in payments under the following heads: (a) Pay of guards (b) Rent for the Air Station of ik.800 per mense® (c) Personal subsidy of ks.500 per mensem (d) House rent for the rest house of Ih.30C per mensem (e) Landing fees* 2. The pay of the guards was fixed in the Agreement of 1932 at 8s. 20 per mensem for each of the 35 guards and Bs*40 per mensem for each of the two headmen. Following a representation by the Shaikh in 1944 a temporary war allow ance of 8 r* 5 per mensem was granted to the guards and headmen (Air Headquarters Iraq telegram No.P575 dated 3rd March 1944, copy not forwarded to India Office or Government of India/* Prices and wages have not fallen since 1944 an' ev^ri with this allowance the wage of a guard is some leas than that of daily paid labour. The Shaikh is responsible for the lo cal protection of the aerodrome, the aerodrome establishment, passengers and aircraft and it is essential that the guards should be paid at least sufficient to keep them contented and reliable* I recommend, therefore, that the allowance paid to the guards and headmena should be increased from Ss.S to fis.15 with effect from 1st January 1946* In informing the Shaikh it could be stipulated that this allowance is liable to revision should the cost of living fall. 3 . As regards (b) and (c) I consider that for the fol lowing reasons the Shaikh is Justified in asking for an in crease. (i) the fall in the value of money since 1932 shown by the present high cost of goods and of labour. (ii) the greatly enlarged facilities that have £rom time to time been accorded by the Shaikh since 1932 a or the ®Y®1 Air Force and for Civil Aviation e.g* a large camp for the R.A.F.. increased accommodation for civil establishment, Nlreless staff etc., all of which have been willingly accor ded by the Shaikh* 1 therefore recommend that the rent for the Air Station (b) should be increased to 8s.1,000 a north and the personal subsidy (c) to Rs.800 per month. Considerable use of Sharjah both for Kllitary and Civil purposes is likely to continue for some time, and in any case the payments win /automaticallyautomatically come under revision not later than 22nd July 1948, when the renewal of the existing agreement is due to expire, and by which time a decision will presumably have been reached as to the extent of our future requirements at Shar jah. 4. iiS regards (d), the existing rental for the rest house of 2:,.300 per nenserr is set off against the fixed sum of k.70,929, estimated as advanced tc the Shaikh for the con struction of the rest house ( Pal force letter Ko.CF/ BH/834, dated 27th June 1944 to my address ? copy not forwar ded to India Office or Government of India;. There have sub sequently been additions to the rest house but the Shaikh w s assured in 1937 (i) that the cost of additional accommodation would not be recovered from him and (ii) that additional construction would become his property if we gave up the station (Residency Lxpress Letter Lo.192- ', dated 12th February 1937 to India Gffice, repeated to Bahrain only). I do not, therefore, consider that any increase under this head is justified, and do not recomrrend any. The reasons can be explained to the Shaikh by the Political Agent, Bahrain. 5. As regards (e) the landing fee fixed in the agree ment of 1932 was £;.5 per commercial aeroplane, payable to the Shaikh. Under Article 9 of the Kuwait and Bahrain agreements, landing fees are retained by His Majesty’s Government against the consideration paid to the Shaikh under Article 16. It wil 1 be seen that the fees actually charged at these two pla ces range from £C.2.6 to over £2 according to the weight of the aircraft. As the weight of commercial aircraft has in creased greatly in the last 14 years 1 consider that the Shaikh is Justified in asking for an increase of the landing fee and suggest that it should be raised to fo.10 per aircraft. At this v -ate the average aircraft would still be paying consi derably less than in Bahrain or Kuwait. In the interests of simplicity i do not recommend the imposition of a sliding scale as at these two places. 6 . Unless some Increases are made in existing payments to the Shaikh 1 forsee considerable difficulty, if not failure in persuading him to agree to the assumption of international obligations Ccf. India Office telegram fto.493 dated 7th Jan uary 1946, and connected correspondence not repeated to Air Headquarters, Paiforce) accepted by His Majesty’s Government on his behalf without reference to Him.

Dear Rogers, .x- p lease refer to your letter E 10509/1F35/91 of the 31st August about the propose^ levy force for the Gulf. I find that the proposed exchange of letters about R.A.F facilities with the Shaikh of 1 Sharjah contains no men tion of the Rationing of personnel in the R.A.F.- camp. The drafts concerned were received with Foreign Office despatch No.60 (W 5739/3/80?) of the 19th November, 1948. I would suggest that if it is considered necessary the words 'it being understood that they may accommodate in this camp such personnel as they consider desirable' should be added at the end of the first sentence of the second paragraph in each letter. The drafts have, however, been communicated to the Ruler and ± is possible that an addition of this nature may make him suspicious. Ve have in the past taken it for granted that we can station as many people as we like within the limits of t&gt; e R.A.F. camp without reference to the Shaikh but this was when war conditions existed and on the whole we should he wise to endeavour to obtain the Ruler's consent to the proposed addition.

January 28» 1950 Confidential: D.O.No. 119-0436 Your letter No.C/TC-8 regarding Sharjah Civil Air Agreement. 2, I have re-opened negotiations, but Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr has informed me that his brother vdll not allow him to accept terms less favourable than those which he demanded in his letter of 9th February 1949 to the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, which, as I have your file at present, I set out below for your information. 3 # 2 Head Guards at Rs.60 plus Bs.40 allowances = Rs.100 'Z CX. o 4- Be A A ft '1 n a AH HU* Rs » 80 Batinah and that he was responsible for feeding, clothing and repatriating them, where necessary, and that this proved expensive. It was, he added, his misfortune that during the war, prices had risen and that he was therefore the loser over the former rate of Rs. 55 for head guards and Rs.35 for guards. This, misfortune he was ready to accept, but wished to guard against a recurrence. He said he was actually spending rather more than this sum per head on his guards (which I *f)Vftftible), and considered that the new rates for which his brother was asking were economic, but not more than economic. He also expressed the fear that these guards would desert him for the oil companies unless he made it worth their while to stay. 5. The Shaikh is trying to strike a hard bargain, of course, but I can see some force in his argument about the guards. Since Sir Rupert’s despatch No. 14 (81/8/49 oi 1st March 1949 to the Secretary of State), we have raised the rate for Agency guards to Rs.60 plus clothing and rations on tour. The Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited, now pay Rs. 2-8 per day for guards, with free food, which must bring the actual cost to the Company per man to something of the order of Rs. 100 per month, or Rs. 20 per month above the rate for which the Shaikh is now asking, his first fantastic demands having been reduced to this figure after much hard bargaining on Jackson’s part last year. I suggest that I might be allowed to go up to a limit of F: • 100 fo-i head guards and Rs. 80 for guards as being, in fact, below the oil company rate to which we are authorized to go by Foreign Office telegram No. 240 of 6th May 1949 to the Political Resident. 6. I have resisted any attempt at claiming an increased rental for the rest house on the grounds that the 1937 extention to it enhanced its value. No deduction were made from payments in respect of such additions, and the demand for k. 1000 rental therefore must relate to the original portion of the rest house which was built for Rs.70,929 loaned by H.M.G. A rental of R^.1000 represents a return of over 16$ on the capital, which is more than generous.

It is understood that the matter is of considerable urgency, and as there is no time to approach air ministry to ascertain details of the airfield^ new lease before starting work, it is requested that the following information be supplied to the Officer Commanding ncyal air Force Bahrain, at your earliest conven ience. (a) Does the new lease, now being negotiated by Air Ministry incluae Lhe area required for extension of the runway as shown on the enclosed plan? (b) May permission be granted for work to commence immediately? (c) Can the Royal Air Force divert the existing track to Dibai to run around the end of the extended runway? (d) May authority be granted to the Royal Air Force to halt traffic on the proposed new road when the runway is in use? (e) Can an undertaking be obtained from the Bhaikh of Sharjah that no structures forming flying obstructions will be built in the 15° approach funnel to the extension.

Dear Pelly, I enclose herewith, with reference to your file 460/-/50, which is returned, a copy of a note I made while down at Sharjah, and the letter I propose to address to the Shaikh. I have not officially addressed the R.A.F. on the results. 2 . I would be glad of your views on the subject of extra rental. I see that under the new agreement a rent of Rs.1,000/- is paid for the airfield, so would you consider an ad ditional Rs.100/- p.m. suitable? Yours sincerely. His Excellency Mr. C.J. Pelly, O.B.E., Ag. Political Resident, Persian Gulf Bahrain. S'?,REPORT ON VISIT TO SHARJAH CONCERNING EXTENSION OF AIRFIELD. On Thursday, 13th July, Ip the morning I inspected the area of the airfield with Squadron Leader Lewington and a representative of the A.M.W.D. It was evident that the maps supplied were inaccurate. The effective runway ends about 200 yards before the Dubai - Sharjah track, and these 200 yards consist of rough overshoot ground, bounded by a line of barrels running along the track. The distance beyond these barrels which it is required to extend the effective runway is 250 yards (with the 200 yards overshoot giving an effective addition of 450 yards), and finally another overshoot area of some 200 yards will have to be added. After accurate measurement, it was found possible to use a track that already skirts the hillock, and by slightly restricting the width of the overshoot area from 400 yards to about 380, to make use of a road running about parallel to Sharjah creeks this would greatly lessen the dif ficulties in circumventing the new airstrip, and Squadron Leader Lewington confirmed that such modi*- fications were within his terms of reference. 2. We then interviewed Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr. All the points were raised, including no structures forming obstruction in the flying approach, and the right to halt traffic on the road (though in the opi nion of the R.A.F. representative, the latter would -rLdt. reall^be necessary in view of the overshoot area and the hillocks that rise up behind the road). As Shaikh Muhammad remained doubtful at first, mention was • • •was also made of an increased rental, and that more aircraft would presumably mean more prosperity for Sharjah. He insisted on inspecting the area, and raised some small points which he wanted from the R.A.F. in^better disposal of their sewage, flooding of the road by their airfield drainages by attending to them, I think the R.A.F. will gain much merit with him. 3. Shaikh Muhammad raised no objections, but when asked if the work could start immediately, he said no, not until he had received the proposals in writing from me. As the R.A.F. machinery required considerable repairs before work could be started, I agreed to send the letter down by next routine plane. He said he would leave the question of extra rental to us. Hik M y only fear is that having received the letter he will, in the absence of any Political Officer, think out some pretext for not letting the work start, and I have asked the O.C. Sharjah and Ali Bustani to let me know immediately if there is any such backsliding. Mean- , while, I have told the R.A.F. to proceed with the work as from next Wednesday./\ Restricted.

We have no copy of the Kuwait Air Navigation Regulations which are intended to serve as a model for the addition, so we pre sume you do not wish us to comment in detail on the advisability of such regulations, but rather on the possibility of slipping such an addition into the proposed Air Agreement at this late stage. Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr is easier to deal with than his brother, but at the same time we understand he is very cautious on the subject of the Air Agreement* however, we think there should be no difficulty in getting the proposed addition accepted provided it is fully and carefully explained to him, and it is also made clear that it is not the sort of thing which will entitle him to any extra payments.

Political Agency, Bahrain, 2nd August, 1950. Dear Pinhey, With reference to Felly’s letter No.460/10/50 of 20th July, I am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter I have received from Shaikh Muhammad which shows that the attitude he has adopted towards the extension of the air-field is satisfactory. 2. In view of the speed with which we rushed this through, I feel that there is even more justifi cation than usual in his complaint about our belated- ^ ness in concluding the new Air Agreement. I presume we cannot use General Department’s letter No.GA 95/3 of 23rd May, forwarded to me under your complimentary slip No.308/13/50 of 5th June, as an authority for payment of the guards in anticipation of the signature of the new Agreement, particularly in view of the fact that no date is mentioned from which the increased pay would be effective. Presumably in accordance with Article 13 (1) of the new Agreement, the increased rates in pay will only be in force from the date of the signature and not from the date of expiry of the old Agreement in July 1948. If this Is so, I feel that our delay is depriving Shaikh Muhammad of suras which are really his due. If the matter is going to drag on much longer, I would be grateful if you would con sider raising the question with the Foreign Office of the payment of guards prior to the signature of the Agreement. 3. I enclose a copy also of a letter I have addressed in reply to that of Shaikh Muhammad, in which I have given him certain assurances and at the same time asked for his approval for the suggested increase in rent to cover the extension. My fear is thet if this increase is going to involve any modification to the Air Agree ment, it merely amounts to further delays. Perhaps the matter could be dealt with by a supplementary ex change of letters? Xons sincerely, L.A.G. Pinhey, Esq., O.B.E., The Residency, Jufair.Confidential Ho.C/H-420. Political Agency, Bahrain, 10th August, I960 Dear Pinhey, I have nov discussed my letter No. C/R-409 of 2nd August with Stobart, and he feels even more strongly than I that we should press for the immediate payment of the guards* wages at the new rate prior to the signature of the Agreement, and that also in order not to penalise Shaikh Muhammad the revised scales of pay should be made valid from the date of expiry of the old Agreement. From our point of view, Shaikh Muhammed is a satisfactory Ruler and Stobart considers that we should do all we can to help him. L.A.G.

VTOmU, Will you please refer to the Residency Agent*s memorandum No.938,0230 of 27th October 1948 in reply to Political Agent, Bahrain*s complimentary slip 4856-30/20 of 15th October 1948 about customs duty on aviation spirit used at Sharjah. 2. The acting Ruler has again raised this issue, and asks to be paid duty currently and retrospectively for petrol supplied by B.P.Aviation services to aircraft other than those of the Royal Air Force and B.O.A.C. 3. Shaikh Moh*d bin Saqr bases his claim upon the fact that, although B.O.A.C whose machines sometimes refuel here (about 2 per year) may be regarded as the successors of the original Imperial Airways Company, the numerous charter companies now using the airfi **' * 1 from should pay duty on all fuel supplied to aircraft other than those operated by the R.A.F and commonwealth air forces, and those owned by B.O.A.C. The quantity of this fuel amounts to some 300,#00 gallons per annum at an average price of Rs.2-4-0 per gallon. I suggest that we might advise B.P.Aviation services that they should pay duty in future. At the same time, the Shaikh should be advised to fix his rate of duty at ad valorem. Any higher rate might discourage aircraft operators from using Sharjah. 5. Regarding his claim for retrospective payment I would observe that Shaikh Sultan, having raised the question two years ago, Shaikh Moh*d does not consider his present claim to be entirely without warning and considers himself entitled to such payment. The company , on the other hand, would duty under the terms (clause ^ such exemption. 4. It would appear to me that the identity of the importer t of the petrol is immaterial, but that B.P.Aviation services loo 7o/i2.t no doubt claim-page 2- no doubt claim that they should not be expected tp pay retrospectively a duty which they have no chance of recovering from their past customers. A possible solution might be for them to pay duty ^ retrospectively at a reduced rate back to the date of Shaikh Sultans representations.in 1948.

Regarding the rental you mentioned for the new expansion of the additional area included in the present aerodrome, this rent is very small and not worth mentioning compared with the foregoing area and the present condition.

Your C/TC-136 of 16th August about Air Navigation Regulations. 2. In view of the primitive condition of the local administration, I can see a grave objection to the ohaikh being asked to subscribe to Regulations on the lines of the Kuwait Regulations. 3. At present, air traffic is handled by the aerodrome without either customs or immigration control, this, for the reason that the Ruler is unable to enforce either. I should hesitate to inform the Shaikh that he may appoint 'authorized persons' under article 16, to perform the functions described in articles 6,7,8,12, and 14. In a civilized state, such intervention by the local authority would be perfectly proper and would be of advantage but I fear tnat an 'authorized person' in Trucial Coast might include such trouble-makers as head guards who would seek to use their position to extend their power and perquisites. The present Ruler of Sharjah would no doubt accept our advice in all these matters, but there is no guarantee that in the future, one might not be confronted by the sort of intolerable interference from which Petroleum Development Trucial Coast Ltd suffered last winter at the hands of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi's 'amirs' in the drilling camp. 4. I suggest that it might be better for us to ask the Shaikh of Sharjah to signify his willingness for H.M.G to administer control of Air Navigation on his behalf, rather than that we should give him nominal contro^ of matters beyond his ability to understand, and at tne same time, an excuse for possible future mischief.

Will you please refer to your letter No. 0220/2/8 of 10th September about customs duty on aviation spirit sold at Sharjah? 2. The position regarding other posts in the Gulf is that at Kuwait no duty is payable on aviation products. In Bahrain, duty is charged on the fuel and lubricants supplied, but this is waived on re ceipt of a formal application by the airline operator to the Bahrain Government. The fact that certain odd charter aircraft do not bother to put in this application does not, I think, affect the general issue. 3, , I find that it is the general practice all over the world for aircraft to be granted duty exemption on fuel and lubricants if the next port of call is outside the country concerned. There are some minor exceptions to this rule as in Iraq and Egypt where non-scheduled aircraft are not exempted, but I think the Shaikh of Sharjah would be advised to abide by the international practice.

A short time ago I received a copy of a letter from Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqr complaining that the rental suggested was negligible when compared with the present day value. I consulted Stobart on the question and enclose a copy of his reply. I agree with him that we might well be able to get Shaikh Muhammad agree to the suggested rent if he was presented with the long delayed new air agreement at the same time, and so if there is any possibility of the agreement being concluded in the near future, perhaps we could let this matter drop until it comes to pass. ^3 Yours sincerely, His Excellency Mr. C.J.

This might be preferable to my going to the Shaikh in the first place. I could, however, negotiate with him if he became difficult, and would, in any case, deal with him when an agreement is reached. We will have to decide what to do about the r withholding of the allowances under the former agreement.

Topics covered by the file include: discussion over the maintenance or disposal of camps and buildings at Sharjah aerodrome; the administration and operation of wireless communications at Bahrain, including their transfer from British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) to International Aeradio Limited; the departure around August 1949 of the Sheikh of Sharjah, Sultan bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī, to Bombay for medical attention, and the transfer of his responsibilities in negotiating the air agreement to his brother, Sheikh Muḥammad bin Saqr Āl Qāsimī; negotiations for the raising of salaries of the aerodrome guards, and disagreement over the payment of duty on aviation fuel at Sharjah; Hay’s recommendation to the Foreign Office in mid-1950, that back payments for the rent of the land for the aerodrome, going back to August 1945, be transferred to Sharjah, partly to enable Sheikh Sultan to pay his medical bills in Bombay, and for Sheikh Muḥammad to pay his tribesmen (the Beni Qitab) their annual allowance; urgent proposals in June 1950 for the extension of the runway at Sharjah by the Royal Air Force.The file contains several drafts of a new air agreement for Sharjah (ff 9-12, 69-73, 81-86), and maps showing the aerodrome site (ff 3, 4), originally enclosed with a letter from the Residency to Pelly, 7 May 1949 (f 104), and which can be read in conjunction with a number list of the aerodrome buildings (ff 15-16).Correspondence on the Sharjah civil air agreement continues in ‘File 13/3 Sharjah Civil Air Agreement’ (IOR/R/15/2/938-939).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Airfields</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000343#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
