The three main correspondents are the following: Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel Hennell, Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire; Commodore John Patterson Porter, Commander of the Indian Naval Squadron in the Persian Gulf; and Lieutenant James Tronson, Commander of the HC Brig
                           Euphrates. Most of the correspondence is between Hennell and Porter; however, a small number of the letters received by Hennell and Porter respectively are written by Tronson. Two additional correspondents appear in a couple of the enclosed letters in this file: Lieutenant Frederick Erskine Manners and Captain Archibald MacDonald. The two main subjects of the letters in this file are the relations between the various chiefs of the Arab coast and the whereabouts of the pirate, Saheil ben Ateish. Many of the letters addressed to Hennell relay information obtained from the Native Agent at Sharjah, Mullah Husain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter book</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Tigris, ship</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Clive, sloop ship</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Euphrates, brigantine ship</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Abu Dhabi, Āl Nahyān dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Dubai, Āl Maktūm dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Auckland, steam frigate</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Aboothabee</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kateef</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Debai</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00005f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
