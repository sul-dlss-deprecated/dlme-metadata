Shaik Mohammed thinks that Mirza Hassen Khan is trying to kill him and his tribe and is therefore making preparations for his defence.After a meeting on 28 July 1815 between Mirza Hassen Khan and Shaik Mohammed's cousin Shaik Rehma [Shaikh Rahma bin Jabir], the former returns to Tangastoon [TangestƒÅn] but threatens to take Bushire by force. He returns on 30 July 1815, threatening to cut off Bushire's water supply and storm the town. William Bruce dissuades him and negotiates guarantees for the British Factory.On 3 August 1815 Mirza Hassen Khan's forces hold William Bruce's watermen and deprive Bushire of drinking water, which results in some deaths of thirst. While some merchants negotiate a supply of water to the town, little of it reaches the British Factory and William Bruce reports his distress at the situation. He requests that the Bombay government be prepared to pay for the ship
