Sir # I called oa the Governor-General yesterday to enquire whether he had any plans for preventing a repetition of the Kurdish trouble which began in April of last year, and which, you will recollect, acutely inflamed racial and religious animosity in Azerbaijan, had considerable repercussioni throughout Iran, tended for a time to cloud Turco-Soviet frontier relations, and threatened to embroil the Kurds from Iraq. The gist of his Excellency’s replies was as follows: 2 . military . (i) It is decided in principle, a\&amp; the Russians approve, that the Persian Government will establish three brigades, one at Ardebil, one at Tabriz, the third at Rezaieh. Go far there are three battalions at Ardebil, two based on Tabriz, two at Rezaieh. They are mainly infantry, with no auxiliary units, but at Hezaioh there are a few light tan*cs and some small guns. The Governor-General seemed pessimistic about the prospects of completing and equipping these brigades in any ne-ir future. In any case he said he had t&lt; await General Ridley’s proposals for the reorg4nisation of the Army as a whole. (iij Of the two battalions which came North to Rezaieh last summer, one has returned booth and been replaced by local recruits. The battalions at Tabriz and Ardebil were all recruited locally. (iii) Ror the moment one of the Tabriz battalions is at Alanduab. The Governor-General confirms that it was sent there primarily to protect the sugar refinery and its contents. 3# Gendarmei’le, (i) You are aware of a project to re-establish Gendarmerie poets along the Turkish frontier and I have reported that high military and gendarmerie officers toured the area to select points lor such posts (Tabffcz Diary for November 1942 paragraph 73). he Governor-General told me that little further progress had been made. One difficulty tve was that the Russians, after allowing a part of the necessary arma and ammunition to pass, had prevented the arrival of the remainder. They had their reasons, ho said; the various tribes had all been pressing for ams on the ground that their neighbours were better armed than the;, that they were exposed to danger, an i so on. One gendarmerie officer, he said, had /given Sir Reader Bullard, K.C. -C. ,C.T. ., H.Minister, TEHRAN.came ta hear of It ani had taken exception. Because 'they had not been consulted about any such distribution of weapons they regarded it with suspicion. . ,'»■ (ii) uite apart from this hitch, the Governor-General said that the idea of planting weak Gendarmerie posts along the frontier was bad; they would be wiped out by tije^ ICurdjs as soon as the slightest trouble occurred. Tu his^ opinion there shoull be not less than 50 men at each poo and 20 or '25 posts. .-.11 owing lor replacements, reliefs and su; ply serrices, something lilte 3,000 men would be required and this apparently is mort than the ilussiano would approve, indeed tan the Persians can train and equip. (HiJ We have here a difficulty which has persisted for some time. The i ersian Govern sent is anxious to see its authority restored.; the Russians say they, have no objection; but the Persians! ^ ai:4 have had but one idea for solving the Kurd!problem, namely to apply force ruthlessly as did Reza ,jhah; but thv_&gt;y are not prepar 'd to tackle the Kurds vith the , sn»all nilitdi^ r slfid' gendannerie forces now 1 at the If disposal, although the tos&amp;lsris any these forcee are adequate and have been most suspici“us ot the Persian requests for more.

He says no such a^iijgerjt.i’tm has been made to him liealthough he concedes it may have been ^ male In Tehran without his kno'&amp;ledge.

Hurds . (i) %e Surds, said* the Onvernor-General, have been fairly quiet of 1 te within th 1 ersian borders; there have been incidents, of course, but’ no more than are normal in present circumstances. He dismissed the report that **«ku had been threatened (sec Military Attache’s d imnary ”o.3 of 1943, taragraph 17). Auch reroits he said, were spread by the bans of tfaku becmise they, like everyone else, wanted arms for their protection, wanted to gain bacx something oi /the local3 ft the local power; which &lt;eza M.-.h had t .cen awa.y fron then. (ii) There wnr, however, ample e-v?se for anxiety; 'the Turk.a had complained that there had be^n rai-fa recently .on Turkish territory, that animals had been stolen and t?o Turks killed. The Turkish Consul at Rezaiah had .ade a protest in unusually severe terms. As things are no#&gt; the Governor-Gener al said, it w s beyoni t*he power of the feral an Government to prevent such incidents* He- was atier commissionein! to intervene for the settlement of tribal disputes, without the Gendarmes t ' port them. v.ore* than that, he feared incidents • : ins. /; :: ? ian officer engaged on surveying a valley'which ran^ est from &gt;hoi to the frontier was found strangled last month (probably by some local criminal n who :neuv of his • movements, on foot and alone, but conceivably by persons who hoped to sell his maps across the frontier , ulace tin maprer*’ •tolen); th t pliable to happen again and to eaue-c serioiui* trouble. then in April the Kurds would be on the move again, and almost certainly there won!* be Some raids on the viltage^.

Active steps are *being taken here to remedy shortage of oil and build up reserves which are accumulating as regards benzine, gas-oil and kerosene. This has however not affected the fuel oil situation which depends on tank cars. Anglo- Iranian Oil Company are however being urged to switch white oil tank cars to black oil. This should ease the position, particularly when more tank cars are brought into service. Complain us have recently been received from the Prime Minister about shortage of kerosene and fuel oil. He has been informed x every effort is being made to give satisfaction, but that (a) quantity o± kerosene now sold is double the ordinary consumption at this time of the year, in view of the lack of other fuel and (b) that his figure of fuel oil needs seems somewhat exaggerated.

Prime Minister in New Year broadcast message emphasised that in present war all classes throughout world had been obliged in interests of community and in order secure final victory to give up much that they prized most dearly. Measures required^for winning the war must take precedence over rights of individual and laws of country. It was not good soldiers alone but sound administration and readiness of people submit to hardship that was needed. Although Persia not at war same^principle applied to that country too. Treaty obligations of Persia which were willingly accepted and executed with goodwill required Persian people in same way as their allies to adapt lives and economy to changed conditions. In Persia some people were now trying achieve freedom at too high speed. Democratic Governments'had in general interests restricted individual liberties but in Persia such liberties were being increased at expense of power of Government. If persons who were ignorant of v r orld conditions and indifferent to welfare of country took advantage of war conditions for their own interests result would be disastrous. Good administration depended on support and co-operation of people and called on all Persians to co-operate with him in execution of a fundamental plan and to abandon personal feelings. Wellbeing of Persia depended on preservation and strengthening of friendly relations with Great Britain and Soviet Russia and any weakening by Persia of ties with her allies was result of ignorance, indifference, or malevolence. Persia played worthy part in helping her allies. Latter could only compensate her by giving assistance. At proper moment Persia v/ould ask for compensation. Therefore any weakening of good relations now with allies might deprive Persia of her just reward. In order safeguard welfare of people he had in mind (a) provision of food supplies (b) main tenance of security (c) reduction in cost of living (d) fixing of prices (e) abolition of hoarding (f) imposition of severe KCD.

[En clair ends]. On the whole the Prime Minister's statement which is certainly courageous and constitutes a first step in the direction of radical reform in this country should have good effect. It now remains to be seen if and v/hen his programme will be carried into effect, Shah made a short broadcast speech on similar lines but in far more general terms. O.T.P.

Commander-in-Chief P.M.I. is still responsible for deciding priorities on the railway and essential Persian civil needs continue as first priority. 2. The oil shortage has occurred not through failure to allot priority but through the slower turn round of cistern waggons on the railway, due to operational difficulties experienced by the Americans on first talcing over railway operations. This is being carefully watched by [? grp, omitted. ? them and] is improving. The improvement in the oil situation loss however been delayed through interruptions to military working caused by severe frosts, floods and accidents. 3. Decision to increase oil reserve in Persia was taken in December but was deferred owing to falling deliveries to Russia and on very urgent representations by the Russians that stores,essential to Russians offensive, should not be delayed. The intention remains to build up a reserve sufficent to cover possibilities of future railway interruption and this will be done as soon as facilities permit. [Copies sent to i.r.

Your telegram No.241, nty, t'/atsl V«'e have prepared list of such reforms as are well within the capacity of Persia and I shall urge the Prime Minister again to publish some such programme as soon as possible. Nevertheless too much importance must not be attached to the passing of laws in such a country as this. Perfect laws are useless without a better administration and if the administration was improved as it should be the Persian people would probably worry little about laws for some time. That is why I have supported the American advisers so strongly. Unless they reform the administration and form a body of Persian officials able to carry on when they leave the prospects for Persia are poor. No Persian Government unaided can clear up the administration, 2. It is true we proposed that this Majlis should be dissolved but the .alternative we hoped for was not another Majlis but an interval when there would be no Majlis to obstruct us and to serve the Government as a screen. I look at the Question of the prolongation of the Majlis in the light of considerations in paragraph 1. • It would of course oe an indispensable condition that the Prime . Jlinister was following a satisfactory policy and that the V^teA^Majiis was backing him. The Prime Minister has begun to control the press ( my telegram No,522) and has shown unexpected courage and even siaxesmanship in asking the Majlis to grant wide powers in economic matters to Dr, Millspaugh (s ee my telegram No,550J . If the Majlis grant these powers it is a question whether we and the country might not be better off with the present Majlis prolonged # for short periods each time than with a new Majlis containing considerable Tudeh element sworn to uphold the freedom of the press and (to the extent that it is influenced by the Russians) unfriendly to the American adviser (see my telegram No,555).

As regards propaganda measures generally, our impression is that much might be done to render the Persian people conscious of N * all we are doing for them, ( see my telegram No. 245^[of March 15th]), and careful consideration will be given by Ministry of Information and British Broadcasting Corporation to any proposals agreed upon in 'Tehran.

British Broadcasting Corporation have no objection to any revised proposals being discussed with Liveing, but we should need full details of them for consideration here before decision is reached. The chief difficulty at present is to find sufficient Persian staff, and British Broadcasting Corporation have found it hard to obtain enough personnel even for their present programmes a 4. We have considerable misgivings about proposal to revive S.O.E. broadcasts to Persia. Since we already broadcast in Persian from London, Tehran and Delhi, we are inclined to doubt whether a new series of Persian broadcasts from a fourth station is really necessary or desirable. Difficulty of co-ordinating broadcasts from so many different centres is obvious, and Share a£L Adna could hardly be expected to keep in such close touch with Persian as with Arab affairs.

The behaviour of the Persian press since Soheily came into power has caused me increasing anxiety. The Prime Minister professed sympathy hut claimed that Military Governor would not apply the laws and regulations relating to his functions. The Military Governor was in fact unwilling to act unless he received written authority from the Prime Minister. Each sought to throw the responsibility on the other and meanwhile attacks hy baser newspapers on the Allies especially Great Britain became more and more mendacious and scurrilous. Attacks reached limit March 19th. Iqdam published article attacking foreign domination by England, America, Russia and Poland but as usual the weight of the attack was directed against us. Y/e are accused of exploiting Persia in most callous fashion, ,! Khurshidi Iran'* refers' to the past year as one of treachery ? plunder and spying, says the people are doomed to death and annihilation and addresses Mr, Churchill in an offensive poem. Worst of all however was cartoon representing the misery of Persia under the brutal exploitation and repression which the picture suggests is the work of the foreigner. 2. By the time that I succeeded in obtaining interview with the Prime Minister the Khurshidi Iran had been suppressed and [? grp, omtd, ?when] I showed him the article in Iqdam he ordered that paper also to be suppressed. He states he has come to arrangement with the Military Governor and the Minister of War about the press and promises that papers which attack the Allies will be suppressed. He also states that no more licences to publish newspapers will be given and that the forty or fifty now appearing will be reduced by suppression of the offenders, I shall try to keep him to this programme but he is not a man of courage and the feud between the civil and military though less acute than it was in his predecessor’s time is still alive. 5. I do not expect much help from the Soviet Ambassador in this matter as Russia is rarely attacked while Tudeh party which is supported by the Russians includes freedom of the press in its t Mar /programme. Kinf ( 2 ) programme, I however called his attention to Iqdam article quoted above. He said that violence of the press had aroused his anxiety too, professed to he as keen as I to prevent attacks on the Allies and said that he would speak in this sense to Minister for Foreign Affairs* Foreign Office please pass to Kuibyshev.

On March Hth official stocks of wheat failed in Tabriz and although last-minute arrivals enabled the authorities to resume the issue of flour t&gt;v bread at controlled price to the poor, they are again unable to issue flour to-day and factories and bazaars are closing. (There is bread in considerable quantity but at free market price which is beyond the reach of the great majority). The public here understand well enough that deliveries to Russia have caused this situation. The facts are that some 2,300 tons of wheat had already been delivered to the- Russians before Tehran'agreed to deliver 5,000 tons of wheat and 15,000 tons of barley and that the Russians are pressing for deliveries in full under that agreement, refusing to take account of earlier deliveries. 2. The line taken here by Left-wing agitators who have the blessing, at least, of the Russians is that Fascist Fifth Column is responsible for hoarding v/heat; but anti-Fascist talk has had little success and cannot divert attention here from Russian purchases. 3. As from the date of arrival of American adviser in mid- January I havo ceased pressing for wheat to be sent to Tehran.

Nx&gt;. in la F O. (tcfo ifrirur) I have been considering with my advisers the position revealed by your telegram No. 58 Saving, your letter to me March 1st and report brought back by Rucker of his talks with you. 2. I agree with you that it is regrettable and indeed unjust (though it is useless to look for justice in such matters) that after all that you and your staff have done and despite all the hard work of Middle East Supply Centre we should be accused of responsibility for Persian ills and that our popularity should suffer accordingly. 3. I think we can seek to remedy this situation by: (a) basing so far as we can the supply position, (b) increasing tempo of our propaganda. 4-* Provision of cereals is of course far the most important crop problem. All efforts to improve our relations with Persia would be ruined by starvation in Tehran. I hope shipment already diverted to you, arrangements made to push up wheat and flour by rail from the south, and the steps we are taking 1 d obtain barley from Iraq, will safeguard supplies for April and supplies for June which will depend on March loadings. Present estimate of these loadings is causing me grave anxiety and I regard this question, which is largely outside our control, as by far our most serious problem. 5. Looking further ahead it is vital that Sheridan should lay sound plans for collection of new harvest. I will find out from Lloyd when he returns whether there is any help we can give on this, e.g., help in manpower.f ( 2 ) 6 e Middle East Supply Centre Civil Vehicles Allocation Committee will allocate to Persia as many trucks as possible within limits of vehicles available and I am sure transport board will do their best to see that they are used to the best advantage, particularly in. collecting grain and not wasted in moving about Persian muhitions or troops, 7. Instructions have been given by Middle East Supply Centre that loading permits for consumer goods, other than cereals, are to be handled flexibly subject to: (a) no more shipping being required from areas other than India, (b) no additions being required to quotas' of materials in critical supply. 8, as regards dhow and land traffic from India we hope Lent o early in April. if Government of India agree;, to arrange conference in Cairo . •9* Nevertheless I believe the problem of securing reasonable supply of consumer goods is more one of internal transport than of importation. It is significant that there are now 20,000 tons of goods in Customs and warehouses in Bandar Shapur, Khoramshahr and Ahwaz* To certified consumer goods we must be prepared to allow some tonnage on road and rail at the expense of Russian aid but with increasing capacities this should be possible without actual reduction in aid to Russia. I am glad to hear that road and rail programme for April includes 9,000 tons of cereals and 5,000 other civil supplies. 10. I have discussed the question of propaganda with Moyne and the planning panel (M.E.B. and S,0.E.) Points for consideration seem to me to be , * (a) most important. Replacement of Childs' and strengthening ^ of your staff on the lines you discussed with Moyne, for which W establishment has now been approved. Moyne is telegraphing you separately on this. lata/* ou (b; Implementation of Childs's scheme for strengthening B.B.C. mg* Persian service. Shall wu take this up with Liveing new B.B.C. representative here? ^ (g) S.O.E. have now adequate Persian staff not only to start « . thrice-weekly n^-ws commentaries in Persian to be broadcast from Sharq al Adna which you h ive already approved, but also to expand . into a daily programme of two half-hourly p-.riods, chiefly consisting of news and commentaries. Programmes would be controlled on the spot by Persian-speaking British officer, who v/ould be guided in policy by you, and would expect material from P.R.B* ’ Would you welcome this service, which would work on similar lines to existing S.O.E. Kurdish programme from Sharq al Adna, controlled by the Embassy, Bagdad, It may seem anomalous for S.O.E. to carry overt propaganda, but this station at Sharq al Adna has been/4 © (3) bec^-oonveniently used for Arab propaganda, and I would suggest that this pflmrposed extension of its activities to the Persians might be considered. (d) Oral propaganda. Bracken has arranged for Sir W.Fraser to ask his representative at Abadan (GASS) to help in setting-up local Information Bureau there. This should help the work you have been trying to start in Abadan. I know, of course, of the work already being done by your Consulates and S.O.E. Are you or the Consulates handicapped by lack of funds? (g) Establishment of Anglo-Persian Union on the lines of the Anglo-Egyptian Union seems to me to have possibilities. It should, I think, be kept distinct from the work of the British Council. If the idea appeals to you, we shall send you detailed suggestions based on Anglo-Eg^tian experience. (f) Another proposal which seems to have possibilities is for the organisation of a news service for Persia and from Persia, on the lines of Arab news agency, which serves the Arab Middle East* Details of this scheme have already been discussed with Pass Lambton, and if you concurred, it would be put into operation without delay, subject to agreement in London. 11* Final discussion of any of these propaganda proposals must, of course, take place in Tehran. I would be glad to place my advisers at your disposal there, if their presence would help you. We have been searching our minds as to how we can help in situation exposed in your saving telegram* [Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong.]/ V /fcX, era': At.

With the Compliment* of the Under rec^ vtar-y oi StaVi foe Affair* eeeeeee Political situation here is over-shadowed by bread question but anxious interest is being taken by wealthier classes in Tudeh party behind whose ac\tivities they profess to see^Soviet agents! It is true that except^for Isfahan which is chiefly manufacturing town it is in Russian zone^that the party is most active, but published programmes of Tabriz, and Kasvin branches which nave appeared recently are not communistic but highly constitutional and their specific demands for reform are mild in comnarison with condition of poorer classes. _ It may well be that application in their entirety of all demands_in these programmes might lead in a backward community like Persia to breakdown which would favour extreme policy. There is nothing on the surface to justify the accusation that party is directly run by Russia, but present situation is such that it affords a golden opportunity for Russia to exploit the party in the interests of their long^ term policy in Persia. Many tales of Russian political activity have been proved to be untrue but X ^ ^ X 4 -.-4 X 4 'U 4ri I am quite prepared to believe that such activity, which is only to be'expected is going on. 2. Pear 8f Tudeh party and approach of time for elections has sobered deputies and 1- has lead the government to wonder whether it would not be well to postpone the election until “after the war” by which they mean until foreign troops have left the country. The Prime Minister asked my advice and, on the understanding that I was speaking personally and that I must not be quoted, I replied to the following effect. ffe had no cause to think that Majlis was friendly to us and previous governments had suffered unreasonably at its hands. Nevertheless if Government felt they could manage Majlis by securing its support in return for prolongation of its mandate they could plead precedents, including that of Great Britain, for postponement of general election until after the war. If however deputies felt safe until then they might become independent and unhelpful so Government might consider prolongation in the first instance ipj, say, six months alleging desire to surmount financial crisis with the help of American advisers before embarking on election. 3. The Prime Minister then asked what I thought about establishing senate. I said that since this was provided fp* 1 . in the constitution he could hardly be blamed if he put provision into effect except that unless it was accompanied qy programme of reform and by active steps to push it through the Majlis probably it would be regarded as an attempt to saddle the country with a reactionary Government for ever and cause extremist agitation which it was desired to avoid. The Prime Minister agreed and said that he intended in any case to issue programme of reform as • •••••••••■■■■I - • ( 2 ). the G-overnment must try to forestall more revoluntionary proposals and he now tells me that he has set up Cahinet Committee for the purpose P I save him three items which I shall-do my best to induce-him to adopt, (a) establish standing machinery to ensure that laws already passed or to be passed for protection of industrial workers are ree.lly applied.

In our efforts to help Russia vi£ Persia we have become objects of severe criticism from Persia and this has now reached serious proportions, as you are aware it is many years since we enjoyed much popularity in Persia., We had against us ouf Entente and later our alliance with Czarist Russia and then abortive treaty of 1919.- When Reza Shah became greedy and tyrannical, blame was unjustly thrown on Great Britain who was accused of having placed him on the throne and kept him there for her own ends. Our invasion of -Persia could hardly be popular and Persia even threw on us the blame of ’’bringing in the Russians” thus venting their disappointment that we did not . quarrel with Russia for the sake of 'Persia. y; . _ ■ v? :r/ ■' • . : - 2. Gradual^ fear of Russia among the common people has diminished. Educated Persians may fear Russia will not leave Persia after the war and.may not be quite easy in their minds about us and Cabinet' Ministers know that in comparison with the Russians we treat them fairly but on the whole the Russians are not unpopular and we are. Absolute unpopularity would be regrettable but to be placed in a position in which we are compared unfavourably with 1 Russians' is dangerous for us and for Persia, How has this come about? 3. It results in the first place from obvious fact of wnich we became acutely aware soon after occupation viz: that Russian Zone produces the greater part of the country f s food cno supplies,. I am replying separately to-your telegram No, 153 but it can be said now that from Tabriz practically no wheat haseoae to Tehran and we had better not expect any more* Azerbaijr^ is a great sheep area but no sheep cone fron there now. It nay be the fault of Persian officials but it affords striking contrast to areas in which we have influence where we have not only helped the authorities 15 feed their own area but also to sp.are supplies for Tehran whenever possible. It is beginning to be quoted as a proof of Russian virtue and British wickedness that there is plenty in Russian Zone and famine in ours. I regret to say according to my Belgian colleague this view was expressed in his presence recently by [2 groups undec:] ^American officers here. Jl, Bread shortage is of course attributed to us. It is perfectly true that recommendations of this Legation were [group undec: ?undeniably] being based on estimates and on due respect for shipping shortage and for lives of allied seamen, whereas United States Legation,' like Persian Government, favoured rather importation of considerable quantities of wheat 'to be on the safe side”. I am still uncertain that this difficult period when shortage could be turned to plenty by provision for a few thousand tons could hc.ve been tided over if the Government had been reasonably active, landowners • reasonably helpful and the American adviser ready to act in time on advice from this Legation which he has acted on too late and if we had sent to Tehran one third of the surplus Persian requirements. As it is, bread is short in Tehran at present and we alone get the blame from consumers while we also incur hostility of the defaulting landowner as the only people who have made serious efforts to ensure collection of hoarded wheat. . 5. Taking paragraphs 3 and A together we find that the more we do .for Russia, the worse off the non-Russio.n part of Persia is, whereas the less Russia does for the general good of Persia, the more popular she becomes, not only in contented part she occupies but in the miserable part outside the limits of her occupation. 6, Shortage of transport is another cause of‘our unpopularity. A good deal of transport is wasted on unessential traffic but average .Persian attributes the shortage to United Kingdom Commercial Corporation who as you are aware were ordered at short notice to form a fleet of hired lorries to carry goods for Russia. Whether hiring was excessive is a matter for argument. My present [group undec: ?point] is that Persia always blames the British who carry the goods and never the Russians to whom they are carried. 7. In my telegram No, 207 I reported the unfortunate shortage of oil products. This shortage has in fact caused great hardship. Everyone concerned is working hard to restore the situation and it is hoped that crisis will be over in a few days ...3. - 4 £ &lt;C&amp; # days and will not recur. Ultimate cause is the cutting down of stocks in the interests of Russia to a level which in an emergency was found to be inadequate. Again Russia has profited materially and she now profits politically because bitter criticism is being directed against A.I.O.C. who are in no way responsible. 8. Whether the Russians are taking advantage of the situation to depress our reputation and raise their own still further is difficult to decide. It must be admitted that the temptation to do so must be great and we oug£it not to be surprised if some of the many Soviet officials, still more some of the many thousand Persians who left Russia six or seven years ago as real or alleged refugees succumbed to the temptation. 9. Record would be incomplete without reference to finance. ^ Our financial agreement and subsequent attempts to maintain flow of rials brought on us the whole of the criticism which was aroused although America and still more Russia profitted by the rials whose issue we secured. Methods used by Russians to obtain rials for their own spending were indirectly damaging to us but are hardly relevant here where my purpose is to show we have had to bear most if not all of the blame for hardship or inconveniences which our aid to Russia has caused to Persian people. 10. I am fully conscious that flow of supplies to Russia must be maintained but that failure to furnish civilian population with its minimum needs not only arouses criticism qgainstus but as you have pointed out reduces efficiency of Persia, as a supply route to Russia. As to the remedies civilian transport is already being safe-guarded by Road Transport Board,,. Apart from that first thing is to build up oil stocks to a safe level. Next is to push up from base supplies of wheat as soon as received and to ensure that transport they require comes out of Soviet tonnage and not out of the 200 tons a day allocated to ordinary Persian requirements. Both these points are I know receiving earnest attention. Last is to help application for import permits with an eye to political as well as to economic warfare considerations and to see for instance whether supplies and land traffic from India cannot be excluded from official import quotas. 11. In remembering Russia we must not forget ourselves entirely. This is what we have been in danger of doing. [Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong].

Deputation from Mejliss waited on the Shah yesterday and proposed Soheily to succeed Q. as Prime Minister. The Shah said he wanted to appoint the present Minister for Foreign affairs Saed as Prime Minister. Deputies suggested it was too late to propose Saed, as they had decided on Soheily, but the Shah sent them away to think it over. 2. The reason for the deputies choice is obvious. While in office Soheily tried to buy them off by jobs and promises, and in any case, being like them corrupt, he is amenable to influence whereas Saed is honest and without ambition and sensible enough to see that to submit to black-mail does not pay in the long run. The objection to Saed from our point of view is his weakness. If he were Prime Minister, the country would probably be run in fact by the Shah and the Chief of General Staff. Nothing, however, could be much worse than [grp. undec.j last few weeks and I think that we may have to accept either Saed or Soheily. Saed would work with us from conviction and Soheily because it is now obvious, as it was not when he was in power before, that the allies are going to win. 3. The Shah has stated repeatedly, once he had a Prime Minister whom he could trust he would not hesitate to dissolve the Mejliss if it continued to be troublesome. Thus some good may come out of the present crisis though the situation, where there is no check on the Shah and Army, is not without danger. 4. Movement in favour of Sayyid Zia which was at first insignificant seems to be growing. Line taken by the Legation about him is that it is for Persia to bring him back if they want him. 5.

P P P P IMPORTMT My telegram No. 132. All conversations about this crisis were based on the supposition that Prime Minister could not possibly obtain majority in Parliament. The Prime Minister has falsified all forecasts by securing in secret session of decision by a majority of 65 to 42 with one [gp„undec.? abstention] to give him public vote of confidence to enable him to re-organise his Cabinet. He secured this by accepting the bill mentioned in my telegram under reference ? paragraph 4, thereby rejecting the advice of American Financial adviser who is known to have written him a letter deprecating the bill and exposing to risk of removals Ibtihai (number 88 ) who is the best possible, perhaps only ' suitable, person for the post of Governor of Bank. The Prime Minister also suggested to Parliament that they should repeal the law which prevents any Deputy from accepting Cabinet post within three months of resignation from Parliament. The Prime Minister s object, according to him, was to intensify his collaboration^ with Parliament. Parliament did not accept' the proposal but it may have influenced voting. 2. Next step is not clear, I will report again after seeing the Prime Minister. When I saw him after despatch of my telegram under reference I found him resolved not to accept apology from Minister of the Interior even if it was offered, and not disposed to regard seriously my suggestion that he should^negotiate with the Shah at once written procedure governing interviews between the Shah and individual ministers to obviate misunderstandings in the future. There was some justification for this in that he had just come from an interview m which the Shah talked about the weather and only at the end referred to public business when he again refused to allow Prime Minister to dismiss Minister of the Interior. One certain thing is that the Shah chose bad ground on which to fight (paragraph 3 ^ ( 1 ) of my telegram under reference) and has been beaten oil it. It is already stated in the press that the cause of crisis was disagreement about an audience which the Minister of the Interior had with the Shah. First*act of Prime Minister will Dresumeb^vbe to get rid of Minister of the Interior and while it may be a good thing that the Prime Minister shoula in the last resort secure what he wants in face of Palace^ opposition, it is regrettable that it should have seen . effected in this way,* ' 5 # There is danger that the Prime Minister may also refuse to admit present Minister of Finance to new cabinet for refusing to resign with the other ten. This would be serious loss especially as Minister of Finance has the confidence of -American Adviser and of United States Governmenc and I shall do my best to prevent it. [Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong.]V (2) K_ 1943 | [This document must be paraphrased if communicated to any person outside Government service.] [This telegram is of particular secrecy.and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on.] IMMEDIATE^ [4 groups undec*]« [Grp. undec.] cause is the fact that Minister of the Interior called on the Shah without informing the Prime Minister and when asked by the Prime Minister to resign, refused to do so. The Shah refused to accept iresignation of either of them. The Prime Minister secured signatures of ten ministers to some sort of protest but some of them alleged that they were appealed to by the Prime Minister'separately, and misled as to the issue. The fact is that the Shah and Prime Minister distrust each other profoundly. The Shah is inclined to listen to gossip, but on the other hand I do not think the Prime Minister is- straightforward even in the version of affairs which he gives me. 2. After discussion between ourselves, the Soviet Ambassador and I saw the Shah separately February 5th. According to his own account the Soviet Ambassador confined himself almost entirely to urging the Shah to smooth over the present dispute. 5. Being asked by the Shah to give my advice I dealt with the following points: (1) I said that I thought no Minister should see the Shah without the Prime Minis ter*s knowledge. The Shah declared that this had been agreed with the Prime Minister, who had, however, omitted to warn Ministers. I suggested that the procedure should be examined forthwith to obviate such misunderstandings in future, and deprecated dismissal of the Prime Minister on . this issue where for reasons I gave, I thought the Shah'was not on strong ground.

I left the Shah to think over the matter.Soviet Ambassador whom I have just seen insists on trying to patch up the dispute about Minister of the Interior, I agreed but asked whether we could go on indefinitely like this with a Prime Minister who enjoyed practically no support except from Allied Missions, I suggested that we should paxch up the present quarrel but plan alternative Government which could be brought in when there ^is no crisis and so without humiliating the Prime Minister. He agreed. United States Minister is away on &lt; local leave but I have informed Charge d'Affaires who is however new to Persia and does not wish to give an opinion. 7, It is possible that the trouble about bread shortage which is again acute may cut across the line of this political manoeuvring which indeed seems frivolous in present circumstances.

Saving G-overnment of India Saving ^ Kuibyshev Saving * ^\oz Your telegram No. 56. ft '/M « 12 sse 3v A few days ago the Prime Minister sent .an emissary to talk about closer'alliance.. Emissary was vague as to what the Prime Minister had in mind but as he mentioned the example of Iraq, I uttered a v/arning against outrunning public opinion in Persia and advised him in the first place to obtain from American Legion [sic ? Legation] text of declaration of United States which he had not seen. 2. Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs opened the subject formally on 1st February. The Prime Minister declared that at the time of negotiations for the tripartite treaty he was in favour of a bolder alliance than was eventually effected^ and that when he came into power he suggested to the Shah the dismissal of the Majlis and conclusion of closer alliance with the allies of Persia: the Shah had approved the. latter proposal but not the dissolution of the Majlis. I said that while the dissolution of the Majlis might have been desirable on general grounds it would be risky to try to enter into closer alliance without the Majlis* approval and I reminded him that in Iraq.lt was the Majlis which took the initiative! Prime Minister said that this criticism was valid now at any rate, and that he would sound some of the deputies. 3. One remark made by Minister for Foreign Affairs suggested that he expected the Persians would get something out of proposed action. I advised him to read the declaration with care and to notice that none of the signatories had made any demands and that in any case we. were already doing all we could in the way of economic assistance in the execution of the tripartite treaty. Minister for Foreign Affairs disclaimed desire to receive ifi c -CD t consi3gration in exchange for proposed action by Persia and J rtB.943 { dWo A (CcJ talked / IND!' ~FF»CE 1 SB ’ Mmtalked vaguely about position of Persia at the end of the v/ar. Actions, I reminded him would then, as now, speak louder than^ signatures. In the end the Prime Minister decided to speak to the United States Minister who is away for a few days. He also accepted, though rather reluctantly, my suggestion that he .should speak to the Soviet Ambassador as Russia is a signatory of the declaration as well as of the tripartite treaty. 5* Owing to the improvement in the Allies 1 military situation (although he does not admit that this weighs with him), to the initiative taken by Iraq, and possibly to the instigation of the Shah, Prime Minister is apparently toying with the idea of joining the United Nations in the hope of securing some political advantage, but is in some doubt as to the best method of approach, particularly in view of the obvious fact that the country, which is already inclined to say that Persia has done too much and received too little, would not be enthusiastic.

Hurley reports astounding ignorance inside Russia of the extent and importance of the Allied war effort* He mentioned in particular false views as to Great Britain's activities in Persia which were expressed to him by Colonel Deminsky, Staff Officer in the Caucasus who stated (a) Russia was observing Tripartite Treaty but Great Britain was not (b) whereas Russia was sending foodstuffs to Northern Persia^ British were exporting foodstuffs from South Persia (c) it was the British who engineered disorders of December 8 th in order to have excuse for occupying Tehran^ Hurley of course realised that such stories were ridiculous but feared the cumulative effect they might have on Russian population. He felt the only way to counteract this propaganda was by gradual infiltration into Russia of Allied observers who, as he had done, could come into contact with military and civilian Russians outside the official circles in Moscow. 5* Hurlev referred to Anglo-American relations in —, Persia and to the part the American advisers will play, yi He thought it all important that there should be complete &gt;j frankness on both sides and that each party should unload its troubles rather than brood on suspicion which might have v little basis.

[Repeated to Kuibyshev under Foreign Office No. 12].British Consulate-General, Ahwaz, 8th December, 1948*;. v Sir&gt; [J In continuation of my Despatch Ko&gt; 55 of ISth November I have the honour to give a brief summary of the Arab situation to date.- 2. As I reported in my telegram No. 138, I accompanied ‘General Zarrabi to Shush on^ist ^November where we interviewed twenty-six Arab Sheikhs and three Sagwand Khans, all of whom professed submission and promised to cooperate in recovering stolen property and in maintaining security in future. 3. In recounting what had passed at Shush to M-r. Dubois t of Foley Brothers, with whom I keep in close touch in these matters since his company are building the road through this region, I mentioned that certain of the more turbulent Sheikhs were not present at the meeting, which could therefore not be considered to be fully representative. Mr. Dubois immediately volunteered to go up and see these, some of whom he knew personally. General Zarrabi’s approval having been obtained Mr. DuBois saw a number of the Sheikhs concerned, with the apparently satisfactory results reported in my Situation Report No. 51; that is to say, these also promised to cooperate to maintain security in this area. During discussions with the Sheikhs, Mr. DuBois was also able to arrange certain inter tribal truces and to extract oaths from those concerned to settle their differences finally before the expiry of the truces, 4. While infoming General Zarrabi of these events Mr. DuBois mentioned the case of the Ahu Dasht and Gomar raiders who are at present in outlawry in the desert. General Zarrabi then suggested that the case might be settled by the surrender of aims .and stolen property, and an undertaking not to commit furtner acts of lawlessness. If this were done he would be prepared not to interfere with them provided they behaved in future. Mr. DuBois accordingly saw Sheikh Haddaq. of Beit Saad and Sheikh Yereyeh of Kaab Beit Hussein, and they agreed to the following terns j- 1. To hand over the ten rifles they admit they possess, 2. To return all property stolen by them and to make indemnification in accordance with the decision of arbitrators named by them and by Sheikh Haidar al Telayab (Ahu Dasht) and Agha Nezam (Gomar) and to bind themselves to abide by the arbitration. 3. To remain where they are with their bribeamen till arbitration is completed. 4. To commit no acts of lawlessness. jap 5. To conduct themselves at all times as law-abiding'' - Iranian citizens. 6. To give neither haven nor assistance to any lawless elements, and 7. to suppress, in cooperation with other Sheikhs and • /I rani an Copy . No. 59 . ( 22/17 1 A/533) His Majesty's Minister, etc., etc., etc., His Majesty's Legation, TEHRAN.Iranian troops if necessary, all lawlessness within their areas. Nine out of the ten rifles (one is said to be buried in an inaccessible place) have been handed in at one of the Foley Brothers* camps and the arbitration should by now be in progress. Any further rifles discovered in the possession of these . sections would invalidate the terms of the settlement and render them liable to be treated again as outlaws. Two other Sheikhs, Zeghaib and Resein, have been invited to accept similar terns. 5. • Before undertaking this task Mr. DuBois consulted me as to its propriety. We agreed that since the Ahu Dasht raid was a reprisal for action taken by Sheikh Haidar al Talayeb some time ago and was in pursuit of a feud in which both sides have - been the aggressors in turn, an amnesty in this case was not improper. We were in some doubt about the Gomar raid which was committed by the same gang against Iranian villages, but since, the raiders being identical, it was bound up with a settlement of the Ahu Dasht raid, pacification of the area is our present aim and to the villagers of Goraar restitution with some prospect of security in future is better than problematical revenge in the fom of a rounding-up of the raiders by Iranian troops, we felt Mr. DuBois might proceed. 6. If the arbitration is satisfactorily carried out, the whole case may form a valuable precedent. It is of course most important that the Iranian troops should keep faith or the comparative peace that prevails in Arabistan will again be endangered. This has been, and will continue to be, impressed on General Zarrabi and it is to be hoped that he will be able to ensure that his officers commit no acts of treachery. 7.

(No. 376.) .* 1 3 Sir, 1 I HAVE the honour to supplement my de spatch —- r 28th October, by transmitting to you he rewit n copies oi two papers, viz., a note() /s . dated the 26th October, in which His Majesty s Consul-General at Tabriz -pT&gt;r\ry-i Minictpr for ForfiiPTi Affairs, dated the £p&lt;zC Copy No. ^ehran, November 10, 1942. Qjtvi ispatch No. 363, dated the Neff comments on the aide-memoire from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated the 20th October, of which a copy was sent to you in my above-mentioned despatch, and secondly a despatch No. 15, dated the 22nd October, in which Mr. L rquhart diagnoses and prescribes for the Kurdish problem in Azerbaijan. The despatch, with which I am in full agreement, is exceptionally able, and I trust that its inevitable length will not prevent its receiving the attention its deserves. It contains too much material to be summarised easily, but the main points are brought out in paragraph 2 below. 2. Mr. Urquhart’s examination on the spot supports the theory that the Russians first encouraged the Kurds but are now trying to keep them quiet, partly because the Kurds have got out of hand, and partly because the potential military value of the Kurds to them has diminished since relations with the Turks on the frontier improved. Seeing the withdrawal of the hoped-for Russian support, the Kurds begin to wonder whether when the war comes to an end they may not find themselves left to face the revengeful Persians alone, and to cast about for a policy to meet that situation. The Persians, having exploited very tactfully the relatively small incident at Rezaieh, have gained ground at the expense of the Russians. Suspicion of British policy in regard to the Kurds has been aroused in the minds of the Russians—a suspicion which the Kurds may well have tried to foster for their own ends—and it behoves us to endeavour to allay that suspicion. With an eye on the more distant future we must “ do what may be possible to help the moderate men to evolve a modus vivendi which will not require drastic revision when the occupation comes to an end.” Mr. Urquhart has advised Ghazi Muhammad and other leaders to lay their complaints before the Persian Government. The Governor-General, after receiving some good advice from Mr. Urquhart, declared his intention to recommend to the Govern ment that a new Kurdish Deputy should be elected (to replace a man who never comes to Tehran), and that certain responsible Kurds should be paid to keep order. Mr. Urquhart considers the moment unsuitable for seeking that Russian co-operation which might facilitate a solution of the Kurdish question, in view of the Russian suspicion aroused by the fact that Mr. Urquhart himself and Air Vice-Marshal de Crespigny and his party happened to be in the Mahabad area at the same time, and that the Soviet* authorities in Azerbaijan allege (without any foundation) that Colonel Lyon and some other person from Iraq visited the Kurds in the Rezaieh area. 3. The two measures of appeasement proposed by the Governor-General of Tabriz may meet with practical difficulties; if we had our way, the Majlis would cease to exist and the election of another Kurdish Deputy would have to await the next general election; while the proposal to pay responsible Kurds to keep order is believed to be contrary to the plans for the gendarmerie, which are being evolved under the guidance 'of the American adviser, Colonel Schwarzkopf. Mr. Urquhart’s own plan, to try to induce the Kurds to find and follow a policy which will continue to serve them well when there are no Russians and no British between them and the Persians, agrees with the policy which we have tried to follow in Southern Kurdistan, as both sound and honest. Moreover, it seems to be the policy towards which the Soviet authorities are turning, if they have not already adopted it implicitly. 4. Unfortunately the Soviet authorities have again been showing some suspicion of our intentions in Azerbaijan and perhaps in Persia generally. To forestall such suspicion I have always treated the Soviet Ambassador with great bvRl am' [36—13] (*) Not printed. B•j frankness and kept him fully informed of all our activities, so when the consul- general set off for Mahabad without mentioning the imminent arrival of the air vice-marshal (of which he did not then know) it may well have given an an of mystery to an innocent expedition. The presence of armed Assyrians, natives of the Rezaieh area, among the air vice-marshal’s guard, will not have helped to allay Soviet suspicions. I have the impression, however, that the Sovie!| authorities may be nursing their suspicions with satisfaction. Wheil Mr. Urquhart was in Tehran recently, I arranged for him to have a talk with the Soviet Ambassador. The ambassador said to me afterwards that the talk had been interesting, but that Mr. Urquhart’s visit to Mahabad, and that of “ other representatives,” had “ encouraged the Kurds.’ I assured him that there were no other representatives, but I do not think he wished his mind to be disabused of a belief so very convenient to a body of officials who are probably being called to account by the Kremlin for the Rezaieh incident and for other evidences that the Kurds of Azerbaijan are out of hand. Being unable to cram the jinnee back into the bottle, they find it convenient to say that it is the British who are encouraging him to be refractory. If there is such a will to believe that we have been intriguing among the Kurds of Azerbaijan, it is no ground for not trying to allay suspicion, but it is an illustration of the extreme difficulty of doing business with Soviet officials wffio, as Mr Urquhart points out, are not normal. Evidence of their difficulty has come to hand during the writing of this despatch ; the consul at Kermanshah reports that two representatives of the Soviet Consulate at Kermanshah are riding about from village to village in the Sinjabi area—a behaviour whidh we might well treat as suspicious if we wished. 5. I secured an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs tor Mr. Urquhart, whose sane exposition of the Kurdish situation will, I hope, have done something towards dissipating the more foolish of Mr. Sa’ed’s views on the subject. He learned with pleasure that the Persian Government propose to reunite the tw T o provinces of Eastern and Western Azerbaijan; this will eliminate friction between the chief officials at Tabriz and Rezaieh. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister of State at Cairo, to Minbranch. Bagdad, to His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy at Kuibyshev, and to the Government of India. ' — ' ' I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure. Consul-General Urquhart to Sir R Bullai\d. (No. 15. Secret.) Sir, Tabriz, October 22, 1942. I HAVE the honour to send you herewith detailed notes on my visit to Mahabad between the 13th and the 15th instant, and for your convenience to set forth below certain conclusions which I have drawn. 2. Russian Policy .—-I think we have flattered the Russians in so far as we attributed to them a positive or even consistent policy towards the Kurds. I suspect that the war and the occupation of Persia caught them unprepared in this respect, and that their attitude towards the Kurds has so far been improvised and subject to the push and pull of their current needs and emotions. Among these I detect military necessities, jealousy of the British, with perhaps some fear of offending American opinion, and, a poor and increasingly weak third. Communist missionary zeal. 3. I find it necessary to remember at all times that our Russian friends are not normal. They are not normal in that after twenty-five years in the wilderness they lack the background common to other civilised men; their brains work at the mercy of a jumbled deposit of propaganda, uncorrected by any fund of experience and observation. In the result they have made a mess of things in Azerbaijan, retaining respect only because they have some military strength here. Their main blunder originated in the belief that Turkey was preparing to stab them in the back, and that the Persians would join in if they could. It led them to nurse and pet the Kurds as potential allies against the Turks. When, most unfortunately, Serhang Hashimi began arming groups of peasants in the Rezaieh area as a defensive measure against Kurdish raiding in the spring, the Russians saw in this a further danger for themselves, and when the raiding of the peasantry began with the melting of the snow, as it did for centuries before Reza Shah, they stood aside. Indeed, I must believe that they countenanced and gave some shape to Kurdish action, although I do not admit it to any Persian.It is impossible to escape that deduction in view of the immunity of the Christians and Kara Sunnis, of the scrupulous direction of the attack on Ajam villagers, who alone had been selected as suitable to carry arms for the Persians, in view also of the fact that the Kurds always began operations by demanding the surrender of arms. In their inexperience the Russians did not allow for Ajam cowardice, for the traditional fear of the Kurdish raiders^ a fear magnilied into terror after some years of immunity. They were not prepared to see the panic- stricken villagers abandon their homes at the first shot. They must have been taken aback by the flood of Persian propaganda which exaggerated the disaster throughout Persia, an astute, well-timed, well-executed drive w r hich, at least in Azerbaijan, united the peasantry and even the town workers with the landlords in detesting Russia and communism. In the last year the Persians have gained much ground from the Russians. 4. Since my visit to Mahabad I am persuaded that the Russians are almost equally confused and ill-inspired in their dealings wuth the Kurds. I commend as worthy of some consideration the theory that the Baku affair was the outcome of jealousy of ourselves, and of a fear lest we should acquire predominating influence by becoming the sponsors and protectors of a united Kurdistan. You may not be able to accept that theory as a complete explanation, but I would suggest that at least the Russians acted more precipitately, and w r e.nt further, because of a surge of suspicion, than they would have in cold blood, and I believe they have since come to repent their suspicion both of us and of the Turks. At all events the Kurds have found the promise of Baku unfulfilled, and are correspondingly disappointed. 5. I think it probable that we have been mistaken in seeking always in Russian policy the explanation for Russian action; at all events, I confess that I have not reckoned on serious initiative from the Kurdish side. Having met Ghazi Mohammed, I believe him perfectly capable of deliberately using the visits of our military officers in order to influence the Russians to serve his own ends. Having reliable information about his jubilation after Baku and having witnessed his present state of disillusionment, I conclude that he succeeded unwisely well and that he has found the Russian reaction disagreeable. I think, too, that we have in Ghazi Mohammed and his friends the authors of the drive for Kurdish unity and preparedness against attack from any quarter. The Persian story that the Russians took the initiative to assemble the Kurdish leaders at Ushnu in early September in order to make them swear fidelity to the Russians, not to loot any more, and to unite for mutual protection was unsatisfactory in many ways. I now believe the initiative came from men like Ghazi Mohammed, w T ho still hope that by uniting and showing restraint the Kurds may emerge from the war in an improved position, but who are beginning to fear that at the end of the war Britain, America and Russia may be too preoccupied or too exhausted to bother about the Kurds, and that if still disunited the tribes will be easy victims of Persian revenge. Ghazi Mohammed himself told me that after inviting the Kurdish leaders to Ushnu the Russians tried at the last moment to countermand the invitations. The late Soviet Consul-General here begged me most earnestly to believe that the Russians had no hand in assembling that conference. If only he could have been frank I think he would have told me that the Kurds vrere trying to get the Russians to sponsor a movement towards Kurdish unity, that* the Russians had acquiesced up to a point, and then drawn back. 6. Russian reaction from the Baku policy has developed into a pose of pointedly refraining from interference in Persian internal affairs while frowning at the Kurds behind the scenes .for any disorderly conduct. They profess to be ready to let the Persians disarm the Kurds, and they are even now helping the Persians to re-establish the Azerbaijan division; but I question their sincerity. 'I think they still consider that armed and friendly Kurdish tribes may have some potential value, but that they are not prepared to pay the price either with bigger and better Baku trips or with support.for the ambitions of men like Ghazi Mohammed. I expect them to use the presence of Persian troops as a lever for securing the friendship and better discipline of the Kurds, but that they will find ways of preventing the Persian troops from forcibly disarming them. The transfer of the consul-general, Mr. Koulagenkov, to Angora, his replacement by the first secretary from the embassy in Tehran, the departure of General Melnik and a recent summons to the consul in Rezaieh to visit Tehran, may perhaps be interpreted as an admission of dissatisfaction with results so far achieved. 7 The question now is whether the new men, having realised past mistakes and being freed from the interference of military political commissars, will behave [36 13] B ymore wisely than did their predecessors, whether Russia in the second year oi /occupation will cut a better figure in Azerbaijan than in the first. I cannot guess at the answer, but I am sure that the Russians will remain, as before, the easy victims of their morbid suspiciousness, and that we may be able to save them from folly if we can avoid cause for suspicion of our intentions. It should, I suggest, be clearly understood that incursions by British officers into the Russian zone without Russian permission are always ground for resentment and suspicion, and** that the local information obtained is generally poor value for the wider damage' which may be done. Further, it would be a wise precaution if officers whose duties bring them into contact with Kurds would refuse to listen to political talk, since even a sympathetic hearing may be wrongly constructed. 8. Persian Policy naturally aims at re-establishment of the authority of the Tehran Government as quickly and as completely as possible. Moderate men like the Governors-General of Eastern and Western Azerbaijan are prepared to move slowly and profess a desire to give Kurds better treatment than did Reza Shah; at the other extreme are the army officers like Serhang Hashimi, who would like to force the pace, who would ferociously mishandle the Kurds if they could do so with impunity. I think that, after Hashimi’s fiasco at Rezaieh, the officers will be held in check as long as the Russians are here, and we must, I suggest, do what may be possible to help the moderate men to evolve a modus vivendi which will not require drastic revision when the occupation comes to an end. I have discussed the matter with the Governor-General here. 1 put it to him that there had been a great improvement in general conditions, since the removal of Russo-Turkish misunderstandings on the north-west frontier, that the Russians were using their influence to promote order, that in a variety of ways the authority of the Persian Government was growing throughout Azerbaijan and that even the remotest Kurds were beginning to think, with considerable apprehension, of the day when Persian troops would again be in control. I told him that I advised Ghazi Mohammed, Kara Aini Agha and Ali Khan to get in touch with Tehran, to lay their complaints before the Government. I had also told them in severe terms that the Kurds must expect to suffer from the war like any other community, that I saw no prospect of easy prosperity, economic or political, and that their future depended on an understanding with the Persians. My advice to him was complementary. He must know perfectly well that Britain and Russia wanted order and security for their communications, that no one could honestly argue now that either was stirring the Kurds to rebellious action against the Govern ment. The Governor-General said, quite explicitly, that he was now satisfied, and would inform the Prime Minister, that neither Britain nor Russia were intriguing against the Government with the Kurds; he would also report to the Prime Minister that the time is ripe to bridge the gap between the Government and the Kurds by the election of a new Deputy. He would suggest that responsible Kurds be entrusted with the maintenance of order and be paid to do so, each man’s pay being clearly stated so as to avoid disputes. If the Government agrees, he will invite the leaders to Tabriz and he says he is sure they will come and submit. He would then, he says, hold out the promise of equal opportunity with the other subjects of the Shah, and equal privileges in the way of schools, health services and so forth. He demurred when I suggested an amnesty; he thought that looted property ought to be restored, but later gave way, saying that, after all, much money had been paid out as indemnity for those whose property had been looted. Apart from the fact that the looting was much less extensive than it was reported to be, and that much of the thieving which took place was wrongly attributed to Kurds. It would be impossible to trace and recover stolen goods, and the attempt to do so would merely provide the Persian troops with a first-class opportunity for revenge. 9. It would be foolish to suppose that the Governor-General’s proposals can be easily or quickly translated into action. Progress would be easier if Russian co-operation were assured, but I do not judge the moment suitable for approaching my new Russian colleague, and in any case I should not do so in a matter of this relative importance without your approval. As I have reported by telegram, the Russians here are a trifle aloof in consequence, I think, of Colonel Lyon’s alleged secret meeting with Kurds in the Rezaieh district, the Air Vice-Marshal’s passage through Mahabad, and my own visit there (all arranged independently), and it may take some time and effort to reassure them. Unless I am sure of Russian co-operation I propose to let the matter take its course without further intervention. That its course will be tortuous is certain. I detect sharp competition between the Governor of Mahabad and the Governor-General here for the handling of the 160.000 or 180,000 rials monthly subvention which thevrespectively suggest for the Kurds. When I recollect that Amir Assad incurred the keen hostility of the Governor-General by going to Tehran and settling there the terms of his appointment as Governor of Mahabad, I am inclined to believe that even Mr. Fahimy is more concerned to secure a rake-off than to pacify the Kurds. It is possible that his reception of my ideas was eager because he hoped that you might be moved by my report to press forward a scheme whereby a large s^Bi of money would pass through his hands to the Kurds. Nevertheless, I think it useful that the Persians and the Kurds should begin to think of a reconciliation, despite the admixture of base motives. 10. During my visit I was careful to utter none but sentiments of loyaltv and admiration for our Russian Allies. I have, &amp;c. R. W. URQUHART. P.S. Since this despatch was written I have been informed by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Bagdad that the report of Colonel Lyon’s visit to Rezaieh is a complete fabrication. I hope to turn this to good account. October 24, 1942. R. W.

My telegram No. 1555 * ^ollovvmg is substance of two hour private conversation which the Counsellor had on December 14th with the Shah on the present political situation. .The Shah was incensed ‘that it should be alleged that he had instigated demonstrations. I calmed him down by saying that this was eminently a country.of rumours and intrigues and that I myself had been rather surprised that His Majesty's'Legation had not yet been accused of engineering the plot. •' The Shah then admitted he had committed an error of judgement in changing his mind shortly after he had agreed with Sir R. Bullard to the retention of Qawam with a reconstructed cabinet. The fact was rioting was rap* 5 ^^ getting worse and from all sides he was receiving telephone calls to the effect that the only way of restoring order was the resignation of Qawam, _ In the stress of the.moment lie had failed to understand the situation as clearly as he should have done, particularly as he had no candidate immediately, in mind who could -suitably replace Qawam. However he had now accepted Ahmedi*as Minister of War and was fully ready to support Qawam Government, reconstruction of which would very shortly be completed. The Shah was deeply pro-occupied with the future of the Majlis. Speaking personally I expressed the view that it seemed to be in the best interest of the country that if possible it should remain closed for the present to enable Qawam to reconstruct the cabinet and get into the saddle. Although inclined to agree, the Shah felt that if the Majlis was kept closed it would be unconstitutional and might be used against him later as a convenient precedent. At the same time he obviously feared that without the Majlis ho might find himself unable to impose tiny restraint on Qawam. I pointed out that if Qawam ran amok or failed to co-operate, I did not imagine the Allied Powers would continue to give him their support. tiXNA OF HC /The...., 2 , The Shah was not fully convinced,. He felt that recent events •might have had a chastening effect on the deputies and that if '•warned in addition they might behave properly in future. I replied that deputies were like school of children and that the effect of such warning would wear off in 24 hours. If the deputies could be induced to vote for themselves a holiday or to recommend that they should be dissolved for the purpose of holding • election the position would be easier. I much feared however that once the Majlis was re-opened there would be slashing attacks on Qawam and possibly a vote of no confidence. In that event the Shah would find himself compelled to choose between the retention of Qawam or the dissolution of the.Majlis, If he adopted the latter alternative he would have to make it clear that the disso lution was only preliminary to new-election, the date of which might have to be advanced. This would give him and the G-ovemment useful respite, but of course there was no guarantee that the new' deputies would be any improvement on their predecessors. The Shah said he would reflect on the issues involved and discuss it again. The Shah again complained of our arrest of Zahidi saying that if he had been consulted he. would have arranged everything. v I * replied that Zalridi was a clever and dangerous intriguer and that with the examples of Vaziri, whose arrest we had patiently awaited for 6 months, and of four outstanding suspects of whom one at least was in the army, we felt it unfair to impose a task on the Persian authorities which they might he incapable of fulfilling. The Shah admitted that the police were a poor body. I then told the Shah that he must have no illusions about the infallibility of his army. How could he expect junior officers whose nay was less than that of his cook to be honest and free from political intrigue. He agreed and hoped to arrange for increases in pay. I suggested that to keep down the expenditure involved he might at the same time comb out.. some of the worst offenders. I warned him too not to trust too implicitly senior officers who, once they found themselves in a position of power, might well put their personal ambitions before Ihe throne. The Shall seemed lo appreciate this aspect. I asked the Shah why he did not broadcast some declaration to the effect that he had his people’s welfare at heart, was opposed to any repetition of recent disorders and that the present Government had his full confidence in the work of reconstruction. Such a' declaration, coupled possibly with reference to Persian solidarity with the Allies, might have calming effect as showing united front against intrigue and subversive activities. He promised to think 'over the idea. In conclusion I suggested that when the political situation cleared he might like to inspect recently arrived battalion of British troops. The idea seemed to appeal to him.

Unless the Shah again breaks his promise, Qawam will remain in office. He is ready to take into the Cabinet two or three men acceptable to the Shah (e.g. Muhsin Rais, No. 172 and Mutamddi No, 137). He also wishes to secure support of Sipahbod Ahftedi (Military Governor of Tehran since yesterday) by. making him Minister of War. The Shah was eventually persuaded to accept this solution on my urging that to change the Prime Minister immediately after disturbances of 8th December would be fatal to security and stability in future. 2. Solution was not secured without difficulty, Shah, seems to have sounded Soviet Ambassador yesterday about the possibility of forming Cabinet with considerable military elements and to have received discouraging reply. T followed this up with an interview to-day in which I spoke to the following effect.- 3# I was shocked to learn that after promising me yesterday that Qawam could stay in office on certain conditions, the Shah had repeatedly telephoned to him insisting on his resignation.

It is laiovm that certain deputies had encouraged the demonstrations and unfortunately many persons attributed the inactivity of polieg. and army to orders rrou above and even to the Palace.' although there was undoubtedly dissatisfaction at the food shortage, there was very good reason to belicvs that circles hostile 4 to the Allies were trying to gst at us through Qawaa who hah only ju§t concluded \/ith us various ^ important agreements to the advantage of both countries.- It was curious that there should be this attack on Qawa.i when he had lust secured the promise of Great Britain and America to supply Persia with wheat. I greatly feared that Shah’s encouragement of Parliament was partly responsible for the disorders. I deplored the tendency I noticed in the Shah to rely on the army against the Government. I thought it dangerous for the country and even for his dynasty. Ho did not realise how intensely unpopular the Army was. He had urged removal of persons alleged to be corrupii whom the Prime minister had appointed and I was strongly in favour of the elimination of the corrupt, but there was no more corrupt clement in Persia than the Army and i was Sure that if the people came to believe the Shah hoped to rule by means of the Army with a puppet cabinet and parliament, as was done in his father s time, their fear and indignation would bo great* -.. A.*. I cannot say that the Shah enjoyed this talk but he evidently had a bad conscience about the disorders. He threw the blame on the Prime Minister for not keeping order though police were evasive until the evening and then demanded written 4 . ^ + instructions before dealing with the crowds.

The Prime Minister's house has been denuded and set on fire. Persian army and police though out all day made little attempt to restore order until evening when some shooting occurred and a few looters were arrested, 2. I called on the Prime Minister this morning to inform f him of the arrest of Zahidi. (on which I will report separately) f and found him more concerned about the situation and the extreme hostility of Majlis and the Shah. The food situation is admittedly the cause for popular discontent (there is almost no bread in Tehran to-day) but there are good grounds for attributing much of the agitation to elements in Majlis and outside who want office or do not wish measures against hoarders and speculators, which have just been announced, to be carried into effect. I cannot acquit the Shah of a share in the responsibility. Yesterday he said to some deputies whom he had summoned that unless something drastic was done there would oe a revolution from below and suggested that a revolution from above would be better. At this interview he complained several times that he had no authority. 3. After discussing the situation with my Soviet colleague and my United States colleague I had audience with the Shah previously arranged for Lord Moyne (whose visit has been delayed by bad v/eather). I found His Majesty quite on the Ij side of the Majlis though he admitted that he had the greatest^ “contempt for the deputies. I urged strongly on my colleagues behalf and my ov/n that it would be most dangerous to yield to .DS9»rJ the/ \■■■■■■ihhbiihhbibhmbhbb \ V . 2 . the agitation of certain deputies and part of our venal press and that to have yet another change of government at this moment was highly undesirable. The Shah suggested change of government to satisfy ’’public opinion” and declared that if Majlis again refused to co-operate he would dissolve it. He proposed the Minister for Foreign Affairs Saed as Prime Minister. This I know is the plan of the Chief of Staff who is far too much with the Shah. I objected that Saed, though friendly and honest, was quite incapable of running the administration (he is quite futile at any ordinary business). When I left the Shah the position was that Qawwam should change members of his Cabinet and that steps should be taken to remove some of the worst of the officials he has appointed but that he himself should stay. An hour later, however, the Shah pressed Qawwam- very strongly to resign. His . f , determined hostility to Qawwam in face of the advice of ! British, Soviet and American representatives and the fact that the demonstrations were engineered and were allowed 1 to reach such dimensions are disturbing features of the situation. 4. After taking the opinion of the Soviet Amb&amp;ssado and United States Minister I advised Qawwam in our joint names not to resign now but to wait until we can talk to him to-morrow. 3. In the midst of these events the disappearance of Zahidi has so far attracted little notice.

Instructions are being sent to Consular Officers on the lines suggested by him. Meanwhile fairly satisfactory progress seems to have oeen made. 2. I should add that while it is our desire that the lands of tribal chieftains should be returned, that other injustices done to them should be remedied, and that they should no longer be left in a state of abject poverty, as some of them have been, we do not suggest that all of them should be allowed to return to tribal areas. In certain cases tribal leaders have returned and have immediately become a focal point for discontented elements. The murder of the Bakhshdar of Gilan in Kurdistan on the 14th June was probably due to r venge on the part of Oj v. a returned tribal leader (see in this connection my telegram ho. .322 to Bagdad), and the Prime Minister has been pressed on several occasions to see that any such leaders as may cause trouble are kept well away from their former haunts. In many cases, according to our information, the tribesmen do not v/ant them back; and it muso be recognised that Shah Reza’s achievements in establishing Central Government’s authoritity in many tribal areas have been of real benefit to the country and should not be jeopardised lightly by allowing the return of elements who wish to re—establisn the former state of things. 3.

As a result of passage of Currency Bill we have achieved our immediate object and we should now experience no difficulty in obtaining as many rials as we require. Although for the time being a political crisis has been averted, feelings of Majlis towards Prime Minister have become distinctly embittered and intrigues to secure his overthrow are growing every day. It is clear from the tone of the debate that Majlis are seeking to place on Prime Minister all the responsibility of the present evils and to set themselves up as friends and supporters of the Allies._ This rather surprising change of attitude is, no doubt, inspired by United Front shown by Russians, Americans and ourselves here, and fear of dissolution. The effect of our victories in North Africa has, of course, also played an important role. It is impossible to say how long this frame of mind,on the part of Majlis, will last, but I am afraid that sooner or later Majlis will return to their usual tactics of obstruction and futile criticism with the result that no Persian Government will be able to carry on effective government of the country. Many questions, such as food distribution, price fixing^ transport, press [sic] etc., are bound to come up in an acute form and the present Prime Minister, who, it is understood, still intends to obtain special powers from the Majlis on certain issues, may meet opposition in Majlis, which he is unable to overcome. ^In that case dissolution with the risks which it naturally involves outweigh not only the best solution, if we are to avoid chaos of an interregnum during which business comes to a standstill, whilst frantic attempts are made to form a new Government. To my mind Qawam [sic] administration is as good as we are likely to find at present, an opinion which is shared by ray United States colleague and ray Soviet colleague and I consider that so long as it is prepared to co-operate, it should continue to have our full support. For above reasons w circumstances may arise in which dissolution may be the only ' means of_ securing [grp. unaeo.. ] Government in this country, but clearly it would be preferable that Government should govern with a reasonable co-operation with Majlis.

The Shah summoned me and asked my opinion* I tol^ ^ lln the view of myself and my two colleagues.

First Point, Very important aspect present crisis is that of supply of rials by Persian Government for Allied War effort. Rials needed for all Allies for various branches war effort and so far their provision has been arranged in conformity with terms financial agreement entered into between British Government and Persian Government then headed by Soheily. Currency aspects present negotiations arvC concerned*with speedy implementation terns this agreement so. as to cause as little disturbance as. possible to economic and financial structure Persia, But British^Government considers loyal fulfilment this agreement as acid test of sincerity this or any Persian Administration and hopes this p.11 be realised by Mailis Deputies as well as by Government, for this matter vital for continuation aid to Russia c This important test part Allied war effort which also directly caicerned with maintenance Persian integrity vis-a-vis possible ^jcis aggression. Speedy solution currency question essential if present crisis to be solved. It is clearly m best interests all Persians that crisis should be solved ior, if it continues, Majlis will face very grave responsibility in country which above all demands stability and firm and efficient administration capable taking at once all necessary measures to insure people against rising prices and cliccts short suoply staple commodities and transport necessary distribute those, 2. Second Point, Wheat shortage. Unneedful dwell on importance this, British Government with Allies as whole- greatly moved by existing distress Persiaand there is no doubt their desire and willingness to assist. ....ButBut before any assistance would be of practical value it is quite clear that Persian Government must take measures to insure that anything 'that may be imported is properly administered and not-used simply to permit hoarders continue hoarding and speculators speculating* For appreciation this view point; one only has .to recall what, happened last year when British Government with; •- realest sacrifice imported seventy thousand tons wheat to help Persia tide over difficult period following change regime. No effective measures were taken and unlimited consumption, unlimited hoarding and unlimited speculation continued with disastrous results. Obvious therefore that really important point in present deli'&amp;erations is concerned with obtaining assurances that there will be no repetition previous mistakes and that ; - any v/heat coming in will be handled by Administration properly equipped for .dealing with this matter expeditiously and v/ithout disturbance by pressure from interested groups or persons. British Government therefore anxiously awaiting moment when Persian conditions will allow it to intervene as -^ritish Government is ready to do in order help Persian people. And may take for granted that American Government fully agrees with this course &lt; action and equally ready to help, as indeed are all Allies in their respective spheres. 5. Third Point* Measures must be taken for controlling prices and must be taken without obstruction by vested- interest or their creatures. 4. Hie Majlis. Surprising that rumours being put.out probably from Axis sources, concerning British Government s attitude regarding role Majlis. We in Britain have come to our own system for taking in democratic manner rapid and all-embracing decisions on matters connected with war but nobody following course .events would ever allege that we departed from Parliamentary Government or that # Parliament r s prerogatives been abolished. //hau is. necessary for democracy wartime conditions is efuciency and ability to make rapid decisions without these being obstructed by sectional interests opposed will majority. Understood that Bill put forward by-Persian Government referred to questions mentioned paragraph one oi my telegram No.1442. Such measures must obviously bs taken urgently to pfmict Persian people and also for prevention Axis agents imputing sole responsibility to Allies ior difficulties v/hich due many causes. What formulae and machinery should be adopted for immediate realisation these essentials is matter for Persian decision.. ^ V/hat is clear is that anybody rejecting any particular solution becomes at once responsible {^r iimediate , provision of alternative but, equally nv efficient method for obtaining same results without delay. All persons concerned should realise this responsabilityo ....PersianI * Persian Government and Allies must be given tools and allowed get on with job. Should also.be.noted regarding any measures which it may take - when it is in position to take them - that Administration will benefit from support and advice distinguished fpreign expert$now . contracted or being contracted. Finally.leader fersian Government is facing difficult and complicated situation with courage and determination midst conflicting claims and usual intriguers losing no opportunities fishing . troubled waters. When he took over Government he received, assurances Allied support and he will continue command this in all measures necessary for gipod Persia lor solution present crisis and for provision stabler and more efficient regime for Persia. 5.

Having been unable to secure undertaking from Deputies m advance to support measures he considers necessary the Prime Minister has prepared bill for submission to the Majlis November 17th. The bill provides that the Government shall have full power until next August. 2. If the Prime Minister secures full power either by forcing this bill through or by dismissing the Majlis it will be because of the support he lias had from His Majesty’s Government in his determination to master the Majlis in some way or other. My Soviet colleague still has no instructions in above sense. My United States colleague tells me that his Government are against the dissolution of the Majlis because this might have bad political effect both here and possibly in other Moslem countries. As it is His Majesty 1 s Government who will have to take forcible measures if no rials are forthcoming very soon, we cannot refuse to allow the Prime Minister to adopt policy which would secure without force an object which is essential to America and Russia as well as to ourselves, and I told the Prime Minister that he had our support in his effort to secure full power.

MOST IMiBDIATE faJeriu. cc £ V/T/e /J ^ 2Q ^ Zou r telegram No^ 1408 [of November 6 th: Persian wheat and currency ansis J is based on deterioration of situation, but I am not clear as to reasons for this. If situation is really becoming^ acute, I should understand you^wish to take present; opportunity to adopt a stronger line with the Persian Government and to insist that in future their policy shall be one of complete co-operation with the Allies. We have, moreover, always realised that the pressure of events may force us to modify our present policy in^ the direction of exercising a greater extent of control over^Persian affairs. But this would involve us in greater commitments, and we should be reluctant to adopt a policy of more direct control unless absolutely necessary, and unless Soviet and United States Governments were in full agreement. 2. All our information indicates that Soviet and United States Governments are unlikely to agree at present with line of action recommended in your telegram under reply. Soviet Government are concerned to keep present Prime Minister in power* and have maintained that the Allies ought to interfere as little as possible in the administration of the country. United States Government feel that a friendly and sympathetic attitude towards Persia is indicated. 5. In any case, I^do not approve altogether your detailed which seem to be open to many of the r telegr am No. 1254 [of September 4th], particular would arouse strong criticism; surely we' cannot expect Prime Minister to agree in advance to alter his Cabinet whenever we wish and to replace non-co-operative members by our nominees. If any Persian Minister adopts non-co-operative attitude, it is always open to the Allies to insist on his replacement. But to ask Prime Minister to give us carte blanche in such a matter is surely stretching things too far. 4. Moreover, as regards point B, it seems unreasonable to expect that the Majlis can be induced to sign away its own powers. It will almost certainly refuse, even if the Government agreed to ask it to do so. Its dissolution would seem a preferable procedure, see my telegram No.l405 [of October-20th], Qcyhll) fr-v 5* /5.

Tehran public opinion is alarmed at the continuing rise in prices, attributed to ever-increasing note issue, for which Allies, but mostly the British, are bleaned, though our war expenditure only accounts for hall the rials now being issued, in return for which sterling is paid, while the Persian Government has financed its deficits for six years past by issuing notes. 3. Feeling is further exacerbated by the bread shortage. Tehran is living continually on verge of crisis; for this the Allies in general are blamed but in particular the Russians foz* not allowing grain to leave .Azerbaijan and Khorassan. Hostility to Poles is also growing. 4. Majlis and press, realising that they are for once voicing public ox^inion, have indulged in much open criticism of the Allies, Government is shaky. Whole position is under discussion with Foreign Office and Minister of State. 3, Security in the provinces has declined, especially in Fars where Persian troops have tried and failed to disarm Qashgai.

P P P Your telegram No. 1285 [of 7th October: proposal to dissolve the Majlis'] The fact that no steps have been taken hitherto to dissolve the present Majlis has been due to (a) Russian view that moment was not opportune for holding fresh elections, (b) constitutional difficulties, and (c) Persian Government’s own reluctance to take drastic measures against the Majlis, partly because although Prime Minister favoured this course, certain members of his Government opposed it. &gt; &lt;. 2. Soviet Government now seem ready to modify their views and to agree to dissolution. 3. Constitutional difficulties are insoluble, if I rightly understand the position, because the Senate, which according to the Constitution has a part to play in the dissolution, has never been set up. I assume that there is no strong demand in Persian quarters for establishing a Senate, and from the Allied point of view a Senate would merely be a fresh, cause of obstruction and delay in passing measures of vital importance to us. The question therefore is what extra constitutional arguments Persian Government might use to justify a dissolution. Provided that .Persian Government do not take the line that elections to present Majlis were invalid f thus rendering invalid all the acts of the present Majlis, including the ratification of the Treaty of Alliance, we can leave this entirely to them to decide. But might it not be sufficient for them to take the line that the whole situation has chang d since the last elections, that new problems have arisenon which the nresent Majlis is quite unable to represent the views of the people, and that the Shah and the Government, in the absence of a senate, have decided to hold fresh^elections in order to secure a parliament more representative of the nation? 4. In short and in the light of your telegram under reference we agree that there would be advantage in^ a dissolution, provided Persian Government are prepared to take this step with our encouragement.■■■■■■■ 2 * 5. Provided dissolution of Majlis is effected for the proclaimed purpose of holding new elections, we think it woula be premature to attempt to determine now within what period such elections should be held. Should the Persian Government require our advice on this point, we should be better able to give it once the effect of tfie dissoluticC; a PP are nV I will speak to Soviet .jnbassadCTin this sense at an early date.

Russians are unfortunately feeling suspicious on account of Colonel Lyons alleged meeting with Nuri ’Bey and the Air Vice Marshal and my own visit to Mahabad. I had planned mine in complete ignorance of the others. I took care to plant material designed, when repeated, to reas.surc them. 3. The popular view in Mahabad is that the Russians invited Kurds to Baku because they were jealous of us and particularly because at the end of September 1941 G-hazi Mahommco sounded a British officer about the possibility of a united Kurdistan under British protection. 4. Effect of Baku has worn off and recent Russian policy has disappointed most Kurdish leaders. They profess to want nothing more than the sort of treatment Kurds of Iraq, ennoy. They arc genuinely trying to compose feuds and to some extent to restrain their followers from exploiting opportunities of the moment. But they arc having little success and. faced with gradual resto ration of Persian authority they fear the possibility of an eventual Persian revenge on a still divided Kurdistan. I en couraged them to - approach Tehran now. First step must be the replacement of the present absentee and cXilc Kurdish deputy. 5. I found the Govcrnor-G-encral here thinking along the same lines. He will^report to the Prime Minister his conviction that neither the British nor the Russians are encouraging the. Kurds against the Government, that a new deputy should be elected to bridge the gap; that responsible leaders should be given official appointments and paid subventions with the promise of schools and health services to follow. He hopes that His Majesty's Himster will support his policy. I suggested an amnesty too*. Governor- General ^ agreed that it would not now be interpreted as weakness but ho is inclined to think that looted property should be restored. I strongly oppose this. Much of looting was not done bv Kurds and any attempt to straighten out that mess would give the Persian Officers the excuse for just the retaliation which it is desired to avoid.^ 6# S$Zf [This telegram is of particular secrecy ana snouia oe retained by the authorised recipient and not passed secrecy ana snouia oe ed recipient and not passed on].

On October 6 th I found the prime Minister and the 'Minister lor Foreign Affairs greatly depressed because it was evident to^ them that everything they wished to do would be delayed or blocked in Parliament by unscrupulous deputies seeking votes or notoriety - most unscrupulous being the most violent, . We-discussed the possibility of dissolving Parliament without using the excuse that elections were invalid, but following this line of argument. ,, (? e gi2f) ’’Persia like all other countries is passing through difficult conditions which call for bold and speedy action. Even in lands where democratic Government has been supported the longest people have accepted in the public interest limitation of right to delay or prevent the Governments action© Persia has had chree Prime Ministers and even more Cabinets in 14 months and the present Cabinet although formed only a few weeks with the approval of nearly all the Deputies is already subjected to most violent attacks so that the^Government is unable to devote itself to urgent problems awaiting settlement. What is most serious is that among the most violent of those who attack the Government in the name of freedom and of sovereignty of the people are men who enthusiastically supported autocratic regime in which the present Prime Minister took no part. In various parts of the country there is insecurity which is encouraged by the fact that trouble makers sec the Government being openly flouted by men who are well known to be unscrupulous and self-seeking. Parliament has failed completely to realise the gravity of the situation and only remedy is to dissolve it and to hold fresh elections as soon as the situation allows ' &gt;v i .

Deputies probably scent danger in the suggestion that Parliament should pass a law constituting a Senate since Senate forms part of the machinery for dissolution of Parliament and they are showing hostility on this point. If they are to be got rid of some extra constitutional remedy must be found. 4. I discussed the subject today with Soviet .Ambassador who has fortunately returned from leave. He agrees with me in general personally. He says that he was in Moscow when recent crisis in Tehran occurred and he had a telegram sent to M. Maisky asking for the latest views of His Majesty's Government. It would be-of the greatest value if Maisky could [grp., omitted: ? be] induced to recpmmend to his Government that they should agree to immediate, dissolution of Parliament and to be content with the holding of fresh elections not necessarily within 2 months as Constitution provides but M as soon as the situation allows”. I fear that Allied interests e.g. current &lt; supplies about which I am telegraphing separately will be endangered if Parliament remains in being not only because of the attitude of Deputies which is undoubtedly due in part to a desire to reinsure with * the Germans* but also weaker members of the Cabinet shelter behind Parliament. The Prime Minister seems to be the most courageous of the Ministers in supporting ,our cause and the best way to help him and ourselves is by agreeing to dissolve Parliament even though we thereby furnish material for Axis propaganda.

He admitted that he had disapproved of our policy in regard to suspects,-because he-thought, such arrests created more enemies than they-immobilised* Neverthe less our policy was his policy, &lt; Turkey=.also wanted a strong and independent-Persia,'* For himself he only asked one thing viz. our help in the following matter. v 7 2, There were, the Ambassador said, elements in Persia which were Turkish by race and religion viz. people of Azerbaijan Shasevens and Kashgai. These elements were and must remain for ever part of the Persian State, Turkey had no irredentist aims. Nevertheless she could not disinterest herself entirely from their fate and he looked to His Majesty’s Legation for help should their interests be injured. t 3, I spoke suitably about collaboration, deprecated raising the vexed question of race, agreed that we also desired a strong and independent Persia (witness the treaty) and said that^help of the Legation which he desired was already being furnished since our policy, with which I had kept him informed, was to encourage the Persian Government to maintain order but at the same time to remedy genuine grievances wherever they might^be found. In what way were the interests of the Turkish- speaking element being injured? The Ambassador said that a large number of the richer people of Tabriz had fled to Tehran and even Isfahan and were afraid to return. I suggested that this, like the flight of most of the officials from Azerbaijan, was rather proof of cowardice which was so strong an element in the Persian character. The Ambassador said that anyhow they were (/ afraid/afraid to go back and adduced as justification that misdeeds occurred in earlier 'days of the Russian occupation especially murder of several Turks of Caucasian origin here and in Tabriz (the Ambassador alleged that it was from a desire to avoid friction with Russia that he did not take up these casesi'but I suspect that it was because the men were secret agents;. Then there were the Kurds who would never be of any use either to Russia or to Great Britain, Their sole passion was plunder* I agreed as to the character of the Kurds but suggested that they were receiving no encouragement at present,. The Ambassador said that Russians were now behaving correctly but for meeting at Ushnu .CCatoiz^'CIngram No, 1 though he did not*, take such protestations of friendship too seriously. Finally the Ambassador said that there were signs of uneasiness amongst agricultural population near Rezaieh: they were having to pay toll to Kurds and some were leaving the neighbourhood [I have since found some confirmation of this in the latest Tabriz diary which says that grain is cheap in Rezaieh because of the feeling of insecurity in the neighbourhood). To my great satisfaction the Ambassador ended by saying that his Government were replacing the Turkish Consular representatives at Tabriz and Rezaieh by capable and steady men, I congratulated His Excellency on having effected this highly desirable change.[CYPHER] POLITICAL LISTRIBJIION♦ f ro; Persia, PROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO IPHRAL.

M. Maisky observed that in countries like Persia the Government in power were often able to influence the elections, and he thought that the new Mailis would probably be found to give the Prime Minister more parliamentary support than he enjoyed at present. 3, It was agreed that you and your Soviet colleague should be instructed to keep in close touch on this matter. You should therefore disouss the position fully with Soviet Ambassador when his instructions have arrived. 4, M, Maisky also referred to a report that the Persian Government were thinking of establishing a Senate.

On September 24th he asked Majlis to pass military service bill which they had already been amending for some months. Deputies wished to propose many more amendments whereupon Prime Minister said that if they did not pass the bill as it then stood he would withdraw it, and, having an appointment with Soviet representative, he left the Chamber, Deputies saw the opportunity to gain some of that credit which they^ hope will secure their return at the next election and attacked the^ attitude of the Prime Minister as arbitrary; while the biggest scoundrel amongst them, Dashti, made heroic speech on parliamentary government and sovereignty of the people. Prime Minister would like to dissolve Majlis but there is good reason to believe that some members of the Cabinet wish to keep it as a screen between them and the Allies, 2, Prime Minister has also incurred criticism on two other grounds, (a) Making some bad appointments especially Farrokh . as Minister of Food (my telegram No. 1239)^and a nonentity Sepehr^ ^ as Governor of the district of Tehran,^ (b) Insertion in preamble to currency bill of a statement, to v/hich I had to insist on his publishing a denial, that His Majesty's Government were ready to sell to Persia considerable quantity of silver. Critics are suggesting that the Government distorted the truth in order to secure passage of bill. 3. The Prime Minister has not appeared for two days. I have not seen him but I have seen Minister for Foreign Affairs who is one of his chief supporters. Minister for Foreign Affairs says [? group omitted : ? he] is urging on the Prime Minister that just as he has ordered the press not to publish attacks made on the Allies in the Majlis so he should forbid the publication of i ' attacks on it such as those referred to above.

The Prime Minister replied to this effect. 2. He agrees that it is not sufficient that the Government should be well disposed towards the Allies and has so informed the Shah. His Majesty’s Government could have no doubt about his own attitude. He was prepared to come out boldly on the side of the Allies but the people needed some preparation. He considered popular feeling was already much better from our point of view than it was a month or two ago. 3. I replied that the Persian Government were I thought trying to be more helpful though their help was sometimes (e.g. in the matter of_currency) dangerously late, but this did not apply to provincial officials who for lack of guidance were unco-operative or even hostile._ The people everywhere would follow a strong lead e.g. the British people during the last two years. The Prime Minister said that the Persians were not like the British but I pointed out that the. Majlis and the population had accepted his leadership when it came to measures against the press and against suspects whose names we had given and they would follow him if he spoke boldly in favour of the Allies. Nuri Pasha was an example: he had made a bold speech which had elicited an appreciative replv from Churchill. I n defending ._ n . ppreciative reply from Churchill.

On the other hand, I am not convinced that it is necessary to adduce specific constitutional arguments. Indeed the Persians themselves have hot'attached undue importance to the letter of their constitution. This provides, for instance, for a Senate which (so far as we know.) has never met. And in any case if the Majlis were out of the way it should be possible to avoid a constitutional discussion in the press. 3. But if the Majlis is not making a nuisance of itself from the practical point of view of the administration of the country, I agree that the matter need not be pressed for the moment.

But although the list of requests in your telegram- p. 1120 accurately represents our desiderata, I do not reel that it would be wise to put these demands to the Persian Government on paper and eh bloc. It is true that they ought as Allies voluntarily to co-operate with us on most of these points. But any government might make difficulties if pressed to commit themselves in writing as regards their future attitude, even though they might be willing to co operate in practice as occasion arose. 5. Prime Minister might well refuse to give the desired assurance on the grounds that some of our demands are inconsistent with our treaty undertaking to respect Persia's sovereignty and political independence, and that certain points (such as (b), (d; and (h)) ask more of the Persian Government than is covered by their treaty obligations. It is not as though we can necessarily rely on support either from the United States or the Soviet Union. Latter have recently indicated that they consider our attitude over the suspects as going unnecessarily far; while former have lent some supoort to the recent Persian suggestion that Tehran should be declared an open city and for«(our confidential information onlw are now considering a new declaration of policy in the Middle East which would inevitably encourage Persian resistance to dei^inds formulated thus categorically. &lt;*&amp;*0 vesof (® 1 / / 4.

It is rather hard to see how this: delay could be increased without breaking constitution. But attachment to the letter of the law is not a feature of Persian character and when it came to the point I think a way of avoiding fresh election would very probably be found., 3. Ground on which dissolution of the Majlis has hitherto been recommended is that it was not elected according to constitution but nominated by late Shah. Prime Minister has suggested that this argument might be used to throw doubt on validity of decisions taken by the Majlis including ratification of Tripartite Treaty. I am searching for some other grounds on which dissolution might be secured but I should be grateful* for your views on Prime Minister's argument which seems to have something in it. Meanwhile Prime Minister seems to be able to dominate the Majlis to judge by its acceptance of our suspects scheme and so long as he remains friendly, we have less reason to fear the Majlis than we had.

Government of India Saving. * • - Your te legram No. l,lQ2o FO* F .4*6 2 /^^ Half-hearted nature of reference to possible resignation of Prime Minister in the Persian Minister's communication to the Foreign Office gave us a hint which was strengthened by the fact that the Prime Minister had proposed to appoint his brother Ambassador to Turkey. It seemed certain that he did not wish to resign. I found Minister for Foreign Affairs vacillating however' owing to •ambiguous reply he had received from the Persian Minister in London, and I urged him to realise the mind of His •n ^Majesty's Government was made up on the question of suspects £./ and'YaJsecure agreement of the Persian Government without further delay.. I followed up this talk with a letter to the Prime Minister in which I said that His Majesty's Government would regard solution of the problem in the sense of our suggested compromise as a test of the sincerity of his policy towards the Allies. 2. The following day the Prime Minister summoned me, and assured me that His Majesty's Government had no cause to doubt the sincerity of the present Government. Co-operation with the Allies had been adopted as essential part of its programme, and His Majesty's Government ought to have confidence An hijp.-v I- saidL that confidence required to be kept alive by acts deserving of confidence, and that only• complete collaboration with us in essentials would justify hopes which we had built on his reputation and the*fact that he had appointed Said (who was [1 gro.- undec. ? present]) as his Minister for Foreign Affairs, it was then that ; the Prime Minister stated that he had decided to accept our &gt; proposals about suspects, and would tell his Cabinet and the Majlis that that was his policy to be taken or left. I said that I was sure that both the Majlis and the people would follow so strong a lead. (In fact, only two members of the Cabinet had ever threatened to resign, and they ; \ changed their minds, while .the Majlis listened obediently, said that they had already given the Prime Minister their confidence, and begged him not to resign. Doubtless the reminder having been already given in the press about the *po werspowers of the Military Governor helped to bring about this wise attitude)* ♦* / . 3* At the same interview I told the Prime Minister that there were other questions also which we regarded as essential, in particular the rate of exchange. We had concluded a financial agreement in May which provided that we should be supplied automatically with rials, v/hereas I had already had to ask him personally on two occasions during l^is short period of office to effect the exchange of sterling for our immediate military needs. Prime Minister said that apart from the fact that the agreement existed he did not 'wish to spend his time carrying out details which ought to be effected automatically, and he promised thdt we . • should have no further grounds of complaint. I have now sent him a letter setting forth our grievances on this head and have asked for written assurances that the agreement will be carried out. 4* I have been too long in the East to build solid • hopes on any Persian statesman, but there are a few encouraging signs. (a) It seems certain that the Prime Minister wishes to remain in office, and to make a success of his Government. Moreover, his decision was taken before the news from Russia became more favourable to the Allies. ' (b) It is already clear that the Prime Minister^possesses authority far greater than that of his two immediate predecessors. Firughi, besides .being in poor health,- despised political intrigue, while Soheily was little known, and was considered weak and corrupt. Qawam even seems to have settled to his satisfaction the dispute between the Army and civilians, and will probably keep the Ministry of War in his own hands. ' (c) Q has checked the press, and is showing and instilling into his colleagues activity in the all-- important treaty question. 5. Q seems, therefore, to deserve support, the more so as we know.him to be acceptable to the Russians, but he can only receive our support which it is now clear he values so long as he complies with our wishes in essential matters without the delays which have hitherto endangered our interests from time to time. (See my immediately following telegram). ; ' 6. I am keeping my. Soviet colleague and my United States colleague informed. United States Minister agreed that he could support me on the^question of rials which affect ; • American interests too, and that he could go so far as to&lt; say ’that 5th Column was a real menace which the Persian Government ought to help us to remove.

There are over twenty Persian nev/spapers some of them with suspiciously small circulations and I understand there are about twenty applications pending for permission to publish other newspapers. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister have both assured me that energetic steps to control the press will be taken and the Minister for Foreign affairs informed me yesterday that the Prime Minister intended to attach the control of press to the Military Governor of Tehran, to appoint more energetic man to this office and to apply press law which dates from before the time of Reza Shah. This law I understand gives wide powers to close down newspapers but I represented to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that in these dangerous times a much stricter control is needed: permission to* publish a newspaper ought not to be given lightly. Printers as well as editors and publishers must be liable to penalties and the Government should consider the possibility of controlling newspapers by rationing of newsprint* The Minister for Foreign Affairs promised to put these suggestions before the Cabinet and also ask the Prime Minister to see that no fresh journal should be allowed to appear until the anniversary of the invasion of Persia is well over.

In recent conversation with the Prime Minister latter made it clear to me that he did not intend to stand any nonsense from Majlis. He told the Soviet -ambassador that he proposed to remind them rather often that their authority did not rest on popular approval. Further the Shah told Counsellor that Majlis seemed to have scented danger as they had recently become far more cautious. We may suppose then that present Majlis will be amenable at least for the time being and that Prime Minister will if necessary not hesitate to take strong action in the interests of efficient administration, but it is possible that Majlis feeling insecure may try to win tactical advantage over Prime Minister by opposing “arbitrary* action we want him to take over e.g. press or Persian suspects and that this might delay dissolution. 2. It is impossible to foresee whether a new Majlis would be much better than present one but it would at least have a constitutional basis and interval required for election would provide government with useful breathing space at a critical stage of war. Moreover it is to be expected that election would be influenced by government in power and that new Majlis would contain strong party giving general support to the government whereas present deputies, now that the late Shah who procured their election has gone, are completely irresponsible* [Copies sent to Mr. Armstrong]. 4t^uA.ci Js M 0 ■„ telegram ^ * ■ ? i COPY o//**-*^ I This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and Should b *1 kept under Lqpk and Key.] 4°^/ !

The area is a bad one and I understand that the Persian authorities recently advised a party of Russians searching for missing aeroplane not to go with less than a battalion. 2. From information furnished to-day by the Ministry of War it appears that the party was attacked by 200 tribesmen, apparently Lurs. The only member of the party to escape was Harris cook. Most probable object of the attack on party was four rifles and possible battery radio receiver, and any money and supplies carried. 3. Military Attachd has requested the British authorities in the area to conduct enquiries with a view to establishing the whereabouts and fate of Dr. Griffiths' son. 4, I have informed the Minister of Foreign Affairs * and used * the incident as another proof that * we cannot * rely on the Persian Government for security, but until I know more about the circumstances I do not feel able to make a strong protest.

At the end of ray talk I mentioned the serious case of assault by an Aranieh Officer on a Kemanshah Petroleum Oempsny s driver.

He characterised them as a pack of useless strutting banks, and that the state of affairs at Oeneral Staff Headquarters was appalling.

Statement continues as follows: policy of encouraging exports of foodstuffs followed recent years has been reversed and Government, with approval of Majlis, has taken steps to forbid export and facilitate foodstuffs. Our Allies have co-operated with us in commercial matters but naturally fulfilment of Government's plans depends on further assistance which we expect. Most important of all, good understanding between Persia and her neighbours which was created by Three-Power Treaty has been confirmed during this period and relations between us have been strengthened so that we can say that there is no cause for anxiety left in this direction. Our relations with America have fortunately become relations of close co-operation and assistance of American Government has been obtained for engagement of civil and military advisers. a*. f A My Government has tried to keep Majlis and press informed &lt; what^doing and has tried consult Deputies and press representa tives: unfortunately it has received no corresponding confidence from Majlis and press and its attempt to behave constitutionally has been misinterpreted as weakness. Indeed, volume of press criticism of Government became such as to affect adversely working of whole administration.

Owing tothe incompetence and corruption of local officials the bread situation is bad in many districts and there have been bread riots at Burujird and Malayir and I know no one who now expects that Soheily, who is himself considered both corrupt and afraid to act,can reform his Cabinet in such a way as to be able to deal with this crisis. The Shah sounded Pimia (Personalities 156) about forming Cabinet but he refused. The general opinion seems to be that Qawam al Saltana is the only man on the spot who could hope to make some headway against the difficulties which beset the Persian Government. The Russian Ambassador would like me to join him in putting Qawam into power but I have told him that apart from the fact that my latest instructions are to put up with Soheily for the present, our policy is to accept any Government which the Persians set up provided that it will work energetically with the Allies&lt;, I added that if Qawam was put forward as Prune Minister at this juncture I should certainly not feel justified in objecting. 2 e The Russian Ambassador saw Soheily to-day and, I gathered, complained of the Government’s failure to deal with the food and transport problems and the fifth column (the I Ambassador declares that the Commandant of the Persian troops Jin Rezaieh gave a party to celebrate the fall of Rostov). Soheily said that he must either resign or remodel his Cabinet by August 2nd. He mentioned several possible candidates for places in his Cabinet but only one likely to be at all popular and to re—inforce the Cabinet is Tadayyun about whom the Ambassador still seems doubtful® The food situation and the German advance in Russia have created problems which I fear are beyond Soheily’s powers and the Russian Ambassador and I have bothcome to the conclusion that his weakness and inactivity constitute a serious danger for the Allies® I am to see the Prime Minister to-morrow and I shall tell him that I have reported to you about his Government in most pessimistic terms.

He says if he invites statesmen of good reputation to assist, they all refuse, whence he induces [sic: ?deduces] that they have acouired good reputation by doing nothing. Dishonest officials seem to depress him. I took the opportunity lo say that unless the government and officials took strong measures against land owners and merchants who hold up wheat, not only might there be serious discontent now but it might lead to justified revolt later. Shah agreed. 2, There has been- criticism lately-iMic. the Shah tries to run the army through the Chief oi Staff behinH^the~~back of the Minister .ot War, and that he deals direct (from/Jthe Chief of police. The Shah was presumably referring to this when he said that if he only gave an order the people shouted ,, dictatorshipf , ^ ~ In effect the Shah probably does try to exercise influence which is not strictly constitutional, but in view of the gravity of the situation the quality of ministers and deputies and inexperience of the people, we should not be justified in advising him against this at present. I am however watching the tendency closely. 3. The Shah professed to be undisturbed about Egypt, but anxious about the situation in Russia. It was doubtless with the latter in mind that he said as I left that it might be necessary for us to have even closer relations. INDIV.

In this connection I enclose herewith the text of an order issued by H.Q.Tenth Army, dated the 25th May. oA 1 '' 4 rtfu- A cT, 2. I have represented to the G.O.C. Tenth Army that it seems desirable, if serious disorders occur in a town occupied by British troops, that there should be some degree of latitude allowed to the military Commander on the spot as to possible intervention to restore order. It seems to me that, if British troop&gt;s stand entirely aside and allow continued looting, rape, burning and theft of valuable stores of foodstuffs and other necessities in a t*ow~n of which we are in occupation, without doing anything to help to maintain order, then we risk losing a very great deal of political and military prestige. 3. General Quinan informs me in reply that, while the maintenance of internal law and order is primarily a matter to be dealt with by the Persian Government, and while he has just received the strictest injunctions from G.H.Q., M.E., that British Forces are not to co-operate with the Persian Government in action against recalcitrant tribesmen without formal sanction from those Headquarters, he agrees to the arrangements suggested in the following paragraphs:- 'In respect of the hypothetical case that you advance of serious disorders occurring in a town near which British troops are located, it will be for the nearest British civil official to/t % • ^ 0 . Tf * # 4 to ask the loa«kl British Military Commander for the assistance of troops in restoring the situation. In such an event it will be the responsibility of the British civil official subsequently to justify ^ fully this action, and for the British Military Commander alone to decide whether or not, in view of the local military situation and the state of his resources, he can provide the troops necessary fjr I the projected operations. As far as Tenth Army is concerned this is well understood as was proved in connection with the disorders in the Basrah area in May, 1941.' 4. -I shall be glad if you will be guided by i these instructions in the event of disorders occurring in the area under your superintendence. 5.

GfSD) GS.I. A Q H.G.R.E. B.R.A. B.A.A. C.S.O !• The question has been raised as to what attitude the Tenth Army should adopt if internal security troubles arise among the civil population. Such disorders might be due to economic or political causes or occasioned by panic following, say, an air raid. 2. In the event'of internal security problems arising, the responsibility for restoring order rests:- (a) with the civil police (b) with the local army whether IRAQI or PERSIAN. 3. British forces are only concerned with:- (a) the protection of their own installations, including communications which are of value to our war effort, (b) protecting the lives of British and allied nationals. The British rorces are not concerned with stopping looting, which is entirely the responsibilityof the local civilian authorities. 4. A further 1 question that arises is the degree of co-operation that we may expect from the IRAH or PERSIAN Armies. This is an unknown factor and will . orobably depend largely on the personalities of local IRAand PERSIAN commanders. We should therefore make special efforts to establish liaison with commanders, and officials so that they may know us and We -them. * • ... 5. Lastly there remains the problem of command if British forces are co-operating with IRAQI &amp; PERSIAN troops. The British commander with firmness and tact will seek to assume full control of the situation. It must be remembered that the British commander, alone, is responsible for the safety and actions of his own command. Therefore he will never accept orders or instructions from either IRAQI or PERSIAN office-rs, even If superior to him in rank, which in his opinion, will prejudice the successful action of his command.

Copies of this despatch and its enclosures have also been sent to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and to the J-oye-pnmR-nt of India. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.) Adrian Holman Charge d f Affaires,In our memorandum No*108 of the 16th February 194^ to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs we urged that steps should be taken to provide adequate animal transport, especially of goods arriving at Zahidan. Consuls have also urged that attention should be given to this x^roblem in their districts* Concrete ^suggestions that have been made comprise: (a) The making of bullock carts, horse carts, fourgons, etc. in various ?areas. (b) The acquisition or hiring of local animal transport. (c) The acquisition from India and Afghanistan of camels to supplement the inadequate suxjply at present existing in Persia* It is understood that rovincial Governors wh,o have given this question their attention complain that without a lead from the central Government they can do nothing, while the central Government adopt the attitude that proposals received from the provinces are too vague for them to take any useful action. Admittedly this is a regional rather than a central problem, but io is essential that the centre should give a lead and xjreferably some concrete instruct ions to the provinces on which they can take effective action. It is not suggested that the Government should itself attempt to undertake i the actual task of acquiring the necessary transport which is required. It is rat er their function to encourage private entertirise oy giving some guarantee that this would not oe wasted. Such encouragement might take the f'ormfof: (a) Offering firm contracts to ! transporters for the local move- i ment ox* goods from the country ! districts where motor roads are scarce to the larger centres on main roads, and (b) The granting of loans on easy terns to transporters or others who would purchase animals or undertake the construct! n of carts suitable for use in their areas. irospective transporters who would like to visit India or Afghanistan for the purpose of purchasing or hiring camels from abroad could be assured that, if they had the backing of the Persian Government, we would ourselves ask the Govern ments of India and Afghanistan to give them every possible facility. 4th June.FROM TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE o r&gt; DEPARTOIBNTAL NO. -9 JUL 1S42 Se*-~ Mr, Holman ^ No^ 881 j j* D* 2.00 p.m. 8th July, 1942 8th July, 1942 R. 4.25 p.ra. 8th July, 1942 Repeated to Minister of State Cairo, Bagdad, Saving to Government of India. g g 2 g g g BH'UjDIaTE Owing to growing unpopularity, the position oi Prime Minister Has been steadily deteriorating. Further he has become the obiect of attack by the Majlis many of whom are anxious to obtain ministerial costs and feel they are being deprived of the snoils of office. During the last few days it' seemed almost certain that the Government would fall, but Prime Minister told me last night that for the time being he had surmounted the crisis. He added however, that the wheat situation was causing him grave anxiety and that unless we could help him out he might find himself forced to resign. ( See my telegram No. 87^)* po ssible successors appear to be fadciayoun, Said, Zia-ed-bih Tabatabai and Qawam-us-Sultaneh. The latter is at present Co v' strongly favoured by the Soviet Ambassador with whom! am maintaining close touch. My United States and Turkish colleagues appear to hold no strong views. 2. How that the posts of Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of the Interior have been filled it would seem natural that question of dissolution of Majlis and the holding of new election should come to the fore again. I doubt,however, whether present Prime Minister would in existing circumstances be strong enough to cope with_such a situation particularly as he has been told by the Soviet Ambassador that owing to present situation on the war fronts, the moment is not opportune. • My Turkish colleague who is aly/ays intensely nervous of Russian intentions is anxious that the Majlis should be placed on a constitutional basis as soon as possible. Otherwise he fears that the Soviet Government will set up strong pro-Soviet administration here under^their own nominee, dissolve Majlis and then do as they like without hindrance. 5. Situation of course needs watching closely, but I am not impressed by the fears of my Turkish colleague, nor do I think that dissolution and renewal of Majlis at the moment by a Government as unpopular or as weak as that of Soheily, is practicable, however desirable it may be from our point or view, and in the interests of efficient Government.

As there is no Persian administration in the area to which Jaf migrate and neighbouring Persian tribes are now armed as never before, Persian Government's attitude appears to be unreasonable, Persians have so far made no charge of lawlessness against Jaf and any unprovoked air action against the tribe will cause grave resentment here and make the future situation even more difficult than it is at present. Can you restrain the Persian Government? • (f.Gj 9JULi942 INDIA OFFICE L- 1/1$ ^ 'to fee.Shahbakhti has, on the authority of the lersian G-overnraent and w th the encouragement of Colonel Fletcher, already made this proposal in Kurdistan. I doubt wheth r this will effect any great improvement as honesty is probably as rare among the Kiirds as among the Persians, and in one locality at least local Kurds have requested the removal of a Kurdish official in favour of a Persian. Nevertheless, such a proposal clearly prevents the question of local Rial-administration assuming a racial aspect. The Persian Government are opposed to committing themselves to all officials being Kurds, and to public instruction being handed over entirely. 5* In general, I propose to support General Shahbakhti who alone seems capable of maintaining order, subject of course to his administration being reasonably enlightened and provided that he continues to enjoy the confidence of the lersian Government. I hope that by suitable discreet local action we may be able to effect nom* improvement in local government in this area. I propose to get severe actiM^gainst any local official against whom charges of corruption and extortion can be brought home. if and when it becomes known that such officials as raeet with ourdispleas by their dishonesty or mal-administration get dismissed from their posts, it should help considerably to make the administration more honest and efficient and should also raise our prestige among the peofjle. 6 .

The full truth cannot yet be Known and it is, X believe, still too soon to brand KAMA RASHID as an out-and-out brigand whose activities have been inspired solely by the desire to sack Kurd istan for his own personal benefit. The case against him eertainly looks black, but I feel that the fact should be placed on record that many Kurds certainly regarded him as the champion upon whoii all Kurdish hopes were oentred • | hopes of obtaining better treatment at the hands of corrupt and oruel Persian Military governors. Had his revolt succeeded, ’ he would doubtless have been acclaimed as a Kurdish national hero and his exactions would have soon been overlooked and for~ given. In his time of adversity it is not surprising that Persians and many urds desonoe him 6*8 a ere rigano. 3, It is clear that HAMA RASHII has been defeated and that Kurdish resistance has now been broken, at least for the present* Sardaght, B&amp;neh, Avroman and I’erivan appear to be the only areas in which Iranian Government Authority remains to be re-established and, now that HA&amp;A Rashid is seeking terms upon which he can surrender, serious resistance in the above-mentioned aree® is not likely to be encountered - uhless of course, the Iranian soldiery commit excesses and the Iranian Government imposes unreasonable and harsh terms upon the Kurdish population which has again come under it* control. There are fortunately, indications that the Iranian Military and Civil Authorities realise the need for treat ing the Kurds reasonably and not too harshly, but no comprehensive programme has yet been made known to the Kurds, shewing whnt reforms it is proposed to introduce in Kurdistan. If the more important causes of past Kurdish discontent can be removed anc if* the Iranian Government can take prompt measures to snow the Kurds that it is really anxious to improve conditions in Kurdis- tan, we may soon see the disappearance of any lingering t,esir which some Kurds may still cherish, to struggle on until all Kurdish grievances are redressed. 4.

Nbject KURDISTAN On the 5 th May I visited SEN AN RAJ and saw General SHAHBAKTI, who said that HAMA RASHID had been recently to Iraq more than once, that the Iraqi Mudir at PENJWIN was in league with him and that the Iraqi Government had not fulfilled its promises of preventing His return to PERSIA should the Persian forces succeed in driving Him out. General Shahbakti outwardly ifelco^med the idea that I should go to SAKIZ and he said he would order Brigadier ARFAA to meet me there. 2. I left for SAKIZ on the 6th May. At MIRANSHAH (J-33W J 10 j6), I met MQHAM.LAD KHAN HABIBI, brother of the late ALI KHAN HABI3I of the TILEKUR tribe, who is now Bakshdar of M IRAN SHAH. He was wearing Persian military uniform and a medal but had no badges of rank. He was friendly but did not strike me as having much character or personlity. This impression was confirmed by what I heard about him later. In*SAHIB there is a garrison of Persian soldiers. Similarly in DIWAN DARREH there is half a regiment and its commander Major ROKNI, said he was awaiting the arrival of the rest of his unit when he would be moving forward. There are also a few troops in BAKLA (I 38 F W 94 II). In SAKIZ there are no troops except a few men of the Persian Supply service. En route I overtook a couple of lorries between DIWAN DARREH and SAKIZ going north with troops and I met a couple similarly loaded coming in the opposite direction. 3 . The Bakshdar otf SAKIZ, SAIFULLAH KHAN ARDALAN, who remained there after the capture of SAKXZ by HAMA RAHuXI), received me and was extremely friendly. The bazaar had been completely and vfantonly looted by HAMA RASHID’S men. One shop in ten was open. I was told i that the population of the town was normally eleven to twelve thousand, and that about half the inhabitants had returned. Up to a week or so prior to my visit the town had been deserted. The excellent school building, the new hospital, and the municipality building had been looted. All doors, window frames, electric wires and even brick tiles off the floors had been carried off. In the ^ school even the black boards let into the wall had been smashed am carried off. The local director of Education, FARJAD, a Persian, had returned the day before to open the school again. On the schoo. wall I noticed anti-HAMA RASHID slogans written up by some of the boys. On the wall of the house where I was accommodated I noticed a similar slogan in the same writing. This may have been a little propaganda for the benefit of Shahbakti and the Ustandar who had visited the towna few days previously. I also saw the remains of the house of Major ZAGROS, himself an inhabitant of SAKE, who commanded the force which was attacked and defeated by HAMA RASHIDS men. It had been burnt. ZAGROS IS now in Senandaj . General A-IINI, was, I # m told, killed on the bridge on the outskirts of the town. All the Kurds whom I met on the road and SAKIZ, with a few except ions, complained most bitterly of the behavious of HAMA RASHID. The exceptions were people from SUNAIEH (J- 38 W H 9206), which was a village which supported RAMA RASHID. They complained of looting by Persian troops and Tilek .’hi tribesmen, who were supporting the Government - Apart from these people I only met Kurds who had either remained neutral or had been supporting the Government. The Persian troops seem to have behaved fairly v/ell, though, while hostilities were in progress round SAKIZ, sheep, eggs and fowls were taken without payment and in SAHIB, the doors and beams of some houses were removed for firewood. ARFAA, now a Brigadier, came to SAKIZ to meet me. I met him on the Jth and went with him to his H.Q. at MIRADEH (J 38 ^ H 5 I 0 /), where I spent a night. He had a battalion on top of a peak on the north of the road near MATRU (J 38W H 5309 )•7 y : -2- * (yg) j (J 38W li 5309)* The rest of his troops are at KAL-I-KhAN (J 3 8 v I 8791 ). which is the pass on the road to 3ANEH* BANili had never heen occupied hy Persian troops, but a reconnaissance by tanks and armoured cars was made# ARPAAA gave the strength of his forces a# about 3,000 men, 8 tanks and some A#C*S. 2 tanks are in SK;AWDAJ orj KEBMANAHAH# He wanted me to ride out to see his troops on the KiLL-l*' KHAN but I had no time to do so* The road over the pass is still J very difficult for motor jcme traffic* He gave me a detailed account «f the operations of the last month, which I took down and add as “a appendix to this report. His statement that HAMA RAShlu has twice -visited WAIN A in IRA^ and was still telling people that he had the support of the British was confirmed by local Kurds* HAMA iiAohlH is at NAMSHIR (J 38V H2302) with about 600 menKe had ordered the inhabitants of BANHH to leave the town and, when ARFAA went there, he found only about 30 inhabitants. I met refugees from BANKH, which had been looted* They complained bitterly of the behaviour of = HAMA RASHID and his men. ARFAA said he was in favour of a peaceful settlement* In his opinion KAMA RASHID would not stage another attack in force but would confine himself to guerilla tactics in the wooded country round BANKH where it would be very difficult to capture him. I was present while ARFAA interviewed the head of his secret service and two refugees from BANKH, to whom he gave uoney* The secret service man said that Ira&lt;ii police had visited the area round the SHALAR river (138 D V 82) and had told Iraqi Kurds to go M to HAMA Rashid 1 s assistance. Some were responding. This of course may have been staged for my benefit. It is,, however, evident that KAMA RASHID is out for himself, is preventing other Kurdish leaders from submitting, and is still trying to get support by claiming that he has British assistance. Negotiations are how in progress but unless KAMA RASHID is eliminated I see little hope of lasting peace* HAMA RASHID broke his word to us not to advance south of the' ^IZIL USUU river and is a brigand without honour or principles. Without him the northern Kurds would probably come to terms. 4 * When I was in SAKIZ?/, SHEIKH SEYYID MOHAMMAD NURANI ZANBILI,. nephew of HAJI BABA SHEIKH, arrived bearing HAMA RASHXD , S terms for submission. KAKULLAH and BAIZID AGHA, chiefs of the MAHABAD section of the GUREK tribe were also there. KARANNI aGHA, an old man of about 70, chief of the MAMISH tribe, was in SENANDAJ, and so was ALI T f,70-1 A NT ZADEH, AMIR ASSAD, chief of the DEHBUKRI tribe^, and who was made Farmandar of MAhABAD at SHAHBAKHTI’S instance. 1*00* I met the latter in SAKIZ. He told me that HAMA RASHID would not listen to reason, that he still claimed to have British backing, had looted disgracefully, and kept the loot for himself. He also said that the Russians were not encouraging HAMA RASHID. AMIR ASSAD ^ was one of the chiefs invited to BAKU. He first received the invitation when he and a few other chiefs were awaiting a message from HAMA RASHID. When they said they could not go as they were waity ing for a message from one of their chiefs the Russians said that &lt;xf|j course it must be a British representative for whom they were wait- ^ ing. According to him the Russians do not want Kurdish chiefs to be too friendly with the British, but want them to be more friendly with the Russians. The Russians do not care much for SHAHBAKHTI as they think he is too friendly with us. The Russians came to MALiABAD where there was a meeting of the Kurdish chiefs to decide on their attitude to the Persian Government. The Kurdish chiefs failed to agree and 34 went with the Russians to BAKU where they were very well received* They were addressed by MIR&amp;A JAFFAM BAGROFF, RAliBAR of the Caucasus, who told them that Russia favoured the freedom of all small nations, that the present time was not favourable for Kurdish independence, that the Kurds must wait and that both Russia and England were sympathetic towards the Kurds. Several of the Kurd chiefs said they wanted independence at once and asked for Russian assistance. MIRZA JAFFAR laughed at them. AMIR ASSAD said that recently a Russian colonel and two assistants had arrived at ut aha~rad to buy horses and that the colonel did not want the Persian Government to know about it. Apart from these men there were no Russians there, though sometimes Russians visited the area. Incidentally I also was told by local people, including the Bakhsdar of SAKIZ that the Russians were buying wheatifheat round KAHABAD ahd BIJAR* AMIR AS3AD struck me as a sensibl# man# Kis yievs \upe as follows:- it is useless for the Kurds to think of independence now. They imist submit to Persian rule, but must schipve unity among themselves in order to resist oppression. After the war perhaps something will be done for them at the peace conference. If not it can’t be helped. I did not see KARAIJNI AGHA but I gather that iis views are the same. _ ' SHEIKH SEYYID MOHAMMAD NTOAHI ZAKBILI is on bad terms with his u* Jr. HAJI BABA SHEIKH, who, after receiving raanjr favours from the ex ^sh, is now apparently against the Persian Government. He brought tht following terms from HAMA RASHID, which were given me by AHFAA:- (a) Either HAMA RASHID or a Kurd of whom he approved to be Bakhshdar of BANISH. (b) BANEH to control the amnieh in BANEH and SAKKIS areas. These amnieh to be Kurds. (c) SAKKIZ and BANEH to be administered on the same lines as MAHABAD, #iere a Kurd, AMIR ASSAD, is Farmandar. (d) SAKKIZ to have a Kurdish Bakhshdar as at present, i.e., SAIFULLAH KHAN ARDALAN. (e) Hostages to be given by HAMA RASHID to the Persians* They are to be either the brother, MOHAMMAD AMIN, or the son of HAMA RASHID and a brother of SALIM KHAN, BEMADEH of BANEH, who is at present with HAMA RASHID. (f) Persian troops to be withdrawn East of the KKUR KHURREH river (i.e., between SAHIB ahd MIRAN3HAA) as the Kurds are afraid of them. AKFAA telegraphed the terras to SKflHBAKHTI, and told me that SKftHBAKHTI had agreed to HAMA RASHID being Bakhshdar of BAK5H+ and to other terms except (f). SHAHBAKHTI would however await the arrival of the Minister of V/ar who is shortly expected from RE2AIEH, before comitg to a definite decision. I was surprised that SHJlHBAKHTI should have agreed to this appointment of HAMA RASHID as the man’s word is worth- loss. It appears that AHFAA was lying for, on my return to KSRMAITSHAE, SHAHBAKHTI told me that he would not have HAMA RASHID as bakhshdar but would accept SALIM. SHUHBAKHTI also laid great emphasis on the neces sity for a Persian garrison in SAKKIZ. 6 . In SAKKIZ the only officials functioning were the Bakhshdar, the local official of the Tobacco Monopoly (both Kurds), and the Direc tor of Education, a Persian. There were two policemen in the town and I was told that a Chjef of Police is coming from REZAIEH. It is not known whether he is a Kurd ot not. A police force is also to be sent up. The amnieh for the SAKKIZ area are to be Kurds and SHqHBAKKTI lias proposed that they should not wear the blue uniform so closely associat ed by the local populace with the worst acts of oppression under the last rdgirae, but should only have a metal badge. He also proposes that they should be under the control of the Bakhshdar of SAKKIZ and I'lRAN- SHAH. I saw three amnieh between SAKKIZ ahd KIRANSHAH. One had forc ibly taken a horse from a village and had compelled another villager to accompany him. The matter is being dealt with by the Persian author ities. In DIWAN DARRKH there are about 30 amnieh, all in blue uniform There are also amnieh posts at BAKLA ( 138 F V? 9411), NAJAPABAD ( 1381: X0733 ) and HUSAINABAD ( 138F W9305 ). Amnieh posts along the read between SENANDAJ and KERMANSHAH have been strengthened and there are complaints of illtreatment of villagers. ARFAA told me that a Persian Captain had been put in charge of the tribal area South of SAI IB. 7« I left MIRADEH on the 7th May, arrived in SENANDAJ on the 8 th and reached KERKANSHAH on the 9th. The delay in sending the report is due to the necessity of dealing with trouble over tne reeding arrangements of Persian labourers in PATAK and the 1 reate le of labourers. 8 . /1 j? w i / - 4 - ^1 8 # CONCLUSIOHS. a) HAVA RASHID attacked the Persians at 3AEKIZ and not vice-versa c»ee Appendix to this report). (fyL, ^a^ority of the Kurds are ready to Come to terms but HAH A I'D is j^rerenting them. M HAMA RASHID's aim is self aggrandisement and looting. He is thoroughly unreliable and any promises hd may make are unlikely to be kept. If givenSposition of influence he is likely to use it to collect more forces and again attack the r Cretans. (d) HAMA RASHID is still spreading stories of British support and is intriwing with Iraqi Kurds, some of whom have crossed the frontier to joinQhim. (e) The Russians are not supporting the Kurdish rebels. (f) The treatment of the Kurdish population by HAMA RASHID has boen worse than their treatment by the 1 ersiand* (s) ersian terms are reasonable except that I consider, that if .iAMA. RAPHID's influence can be Eliminated, no garrison should be kent in SAKKIZ. (h) The local Iraqi officials at PAXTJVIN and possibly HALA3JA (both SIIAHBAKHTI and AHFAA mentioned the latter place) are secretly helping HAMA RASHID, who has twiwe been to WAINA (see Appendix to this report). 9. MCOMMcSTD AT I0K3 (i) The P. A. KIRKUK should visit PAIUVIH and HALABJA and, if the complicity of the Iraqi Officials there is proved, they should be severely dealt with. (ii) A small force of British troops should go to KANJVIU as soon as possible. (ill) 3HAHBAK1ITI 1 s proposals for the settlement of the trouble should be accepted but Persian troops should not be stationed Horth of 3J17ANDAJ once HAMA RASHID has either been captured or caught in IRAQ. SAKKIZ is a small town and a garrison of one brigade is too big and will only oppress the people. The less the people see of the military the more likely they are to live peacefully under Persian rule. (iv) J ersian military officers put in charge of tribal areas should be withdrawn as soon as possible. (v) SHAHBAKHTI should be told not to send officers such as Major laFAHDIAR KHAN 3AYYIR to negotiate with the Kurds. H.M.Consul has already received a complaint against this man. The employment of such officers known to the Kurds for their past brutality is a great mistake and will increase Kurdish reluctance to come to terms. (vi,) Steps should be taken to deoort to Persia a Persian subject named ABDUL RAHMAN living in 3ULAI l\ ANIYKH, who is alleged to act as HAMA RASHID's agent, receive loot from him and bribe Iraqi frontier officials. (vii) Some of the MARIVAN leaders were invited by SHAHBAKHTI to meet him in SBNANDAJ but refused as they were afrEd of being seized. They would probably come if we guaranteed their safe return. This nisivt be considered as, if the MARIVAN Kurds do not open negotiations, there may well be further hostilities in that area. (Sgd.) A. V. PLMTCHDR. It.
