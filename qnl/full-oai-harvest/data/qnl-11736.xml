The original treaty was given a term of twelve years, which was extended at regular intervals afterwards, initially for several years at a time and later on an annual basis.The file concerns the replacement of the existing treaty with a new treaty, following a request from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] that the two parties enter into negotiations to revise the existing treaty. Matters covered include the following: informal discussions with the Sultan regarding the revision of the existing treaty; the Sultan's reported unwillingness to agree to any further renewals of the treaty in its existing form after 11 February 1938; amendments to the initial draft of the new revised treaty, and the preparation of signature copies, in English and Arabic; the signing and ratifying of the new treaty, on 5 and 7 February 1939 respectively; the extension of the provisions of the treaty to certain British territories.The file features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Secretary of State for India; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; officials of the India Office, the Foreign Office, the Dominions Office, the Colonial Office, and the Government of India.In addition to correspondence, the file includes the following: copies of the initial draft of the revised treaty, in English and Arabic (ff 18-53 and ff 54-70 respectively); a signature copy of the draft treaty, in Arabic (ff 100-111); copies of the draft certificate of exchange of ratifications, in English and Arabic (f 177 and ff 179-180).The file's Arabic material consists of the aforementioned copies of the treaty, several items of correspondence, and a transcript of a speech given by the Political Resident on the occasion of the signing of the treaty (English translations are included).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1939)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Dominions Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1891)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00001f#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00001f#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
