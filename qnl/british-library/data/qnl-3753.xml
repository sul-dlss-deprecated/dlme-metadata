Article 3.

[823 aa—1]Article 5. This treaty has been drawn up in the Arabic and Dutch languages. In case of doubt regarding the interpretation of any provision of the present treaty, both parties shall use the Arabic text of the present treaty exclusively.

If one of the two contracting parties wishes to terminate the operation of the treaty after the aforesaid period, it shall give notice thereof to the other party six months before the expiration of that period.
