ABDUL MAJID KHAN (Sardar, Muhammadzai ).—Born about 1875 ; son of Sardar Abdulla Khan, who was killed fighting for Ayub Khan {see Table I) at Girishk, and half-brother of Abdul Aziz Khan, Envoy in India in 1915. Father of Abdul Ghaffur Khan, and Sardar Abdulla Khan ; Grandson of Painda Khan. His mother was an Ishakzai. He lived at Meshed in his youth. In the years 1892-95 he was a perfect fire brand on the Herat border, and gave constant trouble by raiding in Afghan territory. He was twice imprisoned by the Turkish authorities. He then fled to Russian territory where he remained for some years. He afterwards lived at Constantinople, Basra, and Masqat, in April 1903 with 14 followers and 14 manlicher rifles, he landed at Tank near Chahbar &lt;)n the Persian Gulf. Thence he made his way via Kej and Karaj, where Sardar Sir Nauroz Khan assisted him with transport, to near Mashi on the Helmand. Here he came into contact with the local authorities, and, after resisting all one day, he surrendered to the Hakim of Chakansur. The next day he made a futile attempt to escape, and .was sent .as prisoner to Kabul. A letter of reconilriendation w 7 as said to have been sent on his behalf by the Sultan of Turkey. The Amir pardoned him in June 1904. In December 1904 his family arrived in Kabul, from Masqat. In 1905 he was Hakim of Laghman. In 1906 he was relieved and w r as said to have been -entrusted by the Amir with the duty of great importance. In July 1906 he was re-appointed Kakim of Laghman. In 1907 he was a civil Kumedhn in Kabul. In March 1908 he w 7 as reported to have been dismissed. In 1913 he was unemployed in Kabul. In October 1916 he was Hakim of Shiburghan in the province of Maimana, but was reported to have dis appeared after misappropiating Rs. 1,00,000 of Government money and to have crossed the Oxus into Russian territory. His household property was attached and his family were arrested by Government,pending the enquiry regarding him. He is identical with the ‘ Afghan Prince’ who was said to he at Kermanshah on the 5th December 1916, and at Baghdad on December 24th. He gave himself out to be a close relation of the Amir, and stated that his object was to conclude a treaty with the Turks. In February 1917 he was reported to be commanding a detachment of Mujahidin on the Hama dan Front. In October 1918 he was arrested by the Sardar of Bujnurd with another man as suspected Turkish agents and stated that he had travelled to Tehran via Termez and Askhabad, and thence had gone to Bujnurd. His story is that after the arrival of the German Mission in Kabul, the War party put all possible pressure on the Amir to join the Central Powmrs. The Amir finally consented to sign an agreement to that effect, wit it the proviso that Afghanistan would only enter upon hostilities after Germany had supplied arms, money and Military Staff. It was decided to despatch a secret representative to Constantinople to transmit the conditions of the Amir. Abdul Majid who had for some time been employed on confidential duties by the Amir, was selected for this purpose and was verbally instructed by the Amir. He then proceeded to Shibarghan and, having arranged for the safe departure of the Germans feigned desertion as a cloak for his Mission. Towards the end of 1916 he reached Hamadan. Here he was recognised and received with all honour by the Turks who forwarded him to Constantinople. He communicated the Amir condi tions, which were accepted without demur, the only stipulation being that Afghanistan should commence hostilities. Abdul Majid, however, discovered that there was a strong anti-German and anti-Enver party in Constantinople, and he w r as given much advice urging him to advise the Amir against entering the M ar. He therefore refused to go to Berlin or to take charge of the reply to the Amir. He was for- bidden by the Amir to return to Afghanistan. AbdulMajid was released in March 1919 and allowed to go to Tehran where he was to be kept under surveillance. ABDUL MAJID KHAN .—See Mesbah-us-Sultan. ABDUL QASIM KHAN .—See Nasir-i-Khaqam.

From one source it would appear that this was due to opposition from Damad Ferid Pasha ; ii om another that the Sultan had given his daughter the liberty of choice and that Ahmad Shah was not selected. Another version being that Mahmoud Khan Ihtisham-es-Sultaneh bungled the negotiations and was therefore deprived of the appointment of Persian Ambassador. Certain informants consider that the proposed marriage would only have been possible in conjunction with a fusion of the Sunni and Shiah sects. The Persians intimately concerned favoured the project as a step towards the realisation of Pan-Islam- ism and the Sheikh-ul-Islam because Persia would thus be brought under the Khilafat of Constanti nople.

Sattar Khan and his confederates with the aid of Messrs. Moore, an English newspaper correspondent, and Baskerville, an American Missionary, defended the town against him until the siege was raised on the arrival of Russian troops. He was Minister of the Interior in 1910, 1913 and 1915. Prime Minister from April to June 1915,. and for a short while in 1917. In 1919 he was sent as Governor-General to Azerbaijan, where he was flouted by the Democrats who eventually forced him to leave Tabriz. He is an old man and this episode has , presumably ended his public career. He is an old fashioned grandee of the Farman Farma and Sipah Salar school, of fair capacity, very corrupt and full of intrigue. t ; J . AIN-US SI L1ANEH.—Born about 18v0 but prematurely aged.

AMTR AGHA KHAN.—One of the principal Kalantars of the Baharlu, who has been banished by the Qavvam- ul-Mulk. Arrived at Lingah on the 8th December 1919, en route for Kerbela. AMIR AFSHAR.—He claims to have been born about 1825, but 1845 is more probable, son of Hasan Ali Khan Afshar. Has one surviving son, Sardar Fatih (Ali Asghar Khan), of no calibre and addicted to opium, son-in-law to Muzaiyin-us-Sultan in Tehran with whom he is on bad terms. Amir Afshar lives at Karasf 25 miles south-west of Sultania and 40 miles south of Zinjan, owns about 70 villages between Abahar and Jarrus, r.e., in southern Khamseh and surrounding districts and is the most powerful Khan in that province. His only rival is the Sardar Asad-ud- Dauleh, the land-owner of northern Khamseh, who however is no match for him. He is ' the chief of the branch of the Afshar tribe in Khamseh but does not control the Afshars of Sain Qaleh of the Afshars further south in Kharagan. It isAmir Afshar who has made his branch of Afshar tribe well known and not vice versa. Amir Afshar is said to have intrigned with the Turks in 1915-16, got into trouble with the Russians, and fled to Baghdad, where he was at the time of the British occupation. In March 1918 he returned to Zinjan under our auspices and was Governor for a year, hut his performances fell short of his promises of assistance to General Dunstervifle against the Turks. Since the defeat of the Turks he has professed friendship with us, but in 1919 was believed to be in secret correspond ence with Jangalis. He was summoned to Tehran by Vusuq-ud-Dauleh, with whom he was on bad terms, in the spi tug of 1920, but afterwards again he became Governor at Khamseh, where his feudal power is so strong that the position of any Governor is rendered impossible. The Tehran Government is too weak to- enforce authority and the Amir’s influence is required to coerce the lawless Turk population and to prevent an outbreak of anarchy as in Khalkhal. Amir Afshar claims to be able to muster 5,000 armed men, but an estimate of about 1,000 foot and 600 sowars is pro bably near the mark. As chief of the Afshar ‘sowars’ he polices the Kasvm-Tabriz road from Qurveh to Jamalabad. He is an uneducated self-made man who has acquired his position by his own ability and per sonality at the expense of his neighbours! He robs eter to pay Paul and has a reputation for generosity and also .for vindictiveness. Despite his advanced age ami opium sating, his faculties and strong will are deleTo^f T h&lt; 7 S a SkiIful intri 2 uer with a pre- delection for benevolent neutrality until the time comes Ashayir.

He was killed by the Mujahidin in 1909. Ginas Nizam is as enterprising as his father, and unscrupulous. He succeeded him as chief of Darvishvand and recently disposed Zulfiqar Khan, his brother, the chief of the Salkhur section, and also Safar Khan, his cousin, chief of the Gaisvand. They are now being reinstated and Ghias Nizam has gone to Tehran to protest.

He 1 owns some villages in the Rudbar district of Kazvin with residences at Mu’allim Kalayeh and Zavardasht and near Qishlaq, North of the Tehran-Kasvin road, with a residence at Atanak. He was for many years Governor of Tunakaban and the revolt of the Kuiuris was largely due to his capacity. He is a coarse lethar gic indiMdual, an arrant coward, lacking in personality, aad a reactionary.4S AMIR ASHAYIR—Born about I860. Son of Ahmad Khan, Chief of the Shatranlu tribe. He has two younger brothers, Rashid-ul-Mamalik who is very influential with the tribe, and Tapuncheh Khan, and two nephews, Ghulam Hussain Khan and Hussain Quli Khan, sons of his elder brother, Isfandiyar Khan (deceased), and an elder sister, Zamat Khanum (see below).

He served with a part of the “ fauj ” of Khalkhal in Muhammad Ali Shah’s bodyguard, after a period of rivalry with his relations, obtained chieftainship of the Shatranlu, and then with the help of the tribe started to appropriate land and loot. In 1912 Sadar Bahdu Bakhtiari, “son of Sardar ” and Yeprim, defeated the Shah-Savar rebels between Harad and Ardabil, and arrested Amir Ashayir and Isfandiyar Khan and took them to Tehran, where they were detained for two years. On his release he returned to Khalkhal and renewed his lawless activities. For a short while he -was appointed Governor of Gilan by Jangalis, but quarrelled with them and returned to Khalkhal where he and his relatives have become powerful robber chiefs and have overrun the whole of the Khalkhal north of the Kizil Vzun, and repeatedly pillaged the district of Kaghuzkunan south of the river. Since his quan’el with the Jangalis he has strengthened his former friendship with Sadar Muqtadir of Talish. Amir Ashayir’s sister, Azamat Khanum, is the wife of Husain Ali Khan, chief of the Warlike Fuladlu Shah- savans between Khalkhal and Ardabil. She is a mas terful lady with much influence and has secured the support of the Fuladlu for her Shatranlu relations. Amir Ashayir, his brother and nephews maintain a per manent armed following of about 250 men but could muster some 1,000 or 1,200, exclusive of the Fuladlu who can muster about 500. Amir Ashayir becamechief of the Shatranlu by Russian assistance, but after- wards became anti-Russian.

AMIR MANSUR KHAN.—A young' Bakhtiari, son of Ghulam Hussain Khan. Governor Andakai. Unform ed character. Educated in France. AMIR MOYYID.—A Mazandaran Chief living at SavaU kuh. He is reported to be capable of raising a party of 1,500 men with modern arms. In July 1921 he had some differences of opinion with the Persian War Minister regarding the right of recruiting in his area without his permission and apprehended one of the recruiting officers who were'sent into his area by the- Persian Government. AMIR MUAYYID (Ismail Khan Savad Kuhi ).—His for mer title was Amir Tuman. Born about 1850. Has three sons, Sahm-ul-Mamalik, Saifullah Khan and Hajabr-us-Sultan. His grand father, Lutf Ali Beg, of a present family of the Surkheruba district of Savad Kuhuntil, to avoid capture, fled to Tabriz where he entered the service of Nasir-ud-Din at that time Vali- ahd, and afterwards promoted Jalodar. On Nasir-ud- Din’s accession to the throne, Lutf Ali Beg died leav ing two sons, Murad Beg who held an appointment intlxe Shah’s stable and Ibrahim Khan in his Coacb house. Both were promoted, the former to superin tendence of the brood mares, and the latter became head of his department and Mirakhor with the title of Shua-ul-Mulk. Shua-ul-Mulk left four sons, among them Ismail Khan, Amir Muayyid. He is an adven turous soldier of fortune, who entered the Military school at Tehran and started his career as a Naib of the Fauj of Savad Kuh, 300 of whom formed a bodyguard to the Shah in Tehran, with few possessions except his own sharp wits by which he rapidly obtained pro motion until he became commander of the whole Fauj of Savad Kuh (1,000 Sarbaz and 500 Sowars) and was given the rank of Amir Tuman by Muzaffar-ud- Din Shah. He was in the entourage of the Shah and during the revolution of 1909 he started as a Royalist but has since been alternately Royalist and Constitu tionalist according to his interests at the moment and the leading figure in the troubles in Mazandaran since the revolution. His cleverness and personal popu larity won Him the support fif the Savad Kuhis and he refused to give up the Khaliseh lands which were Tuyal for the Fauj of Savad Kuh in accordance with the decree of the second Majlis in 1909 and gradually appropriated more Khaliseh in the adjacent districts of Shirgah and Aliabad. His initiative and self-reli ance have made him the most powerful of the potentates of Mazandaran, viz., Amir Muayyid and Sardar Jalil and Amir Mukarram, the big heriditary landowners of Western Mazandaran who have been tools in his hands. Sardar Jalil the wealthy land owner of Eastern Mazan daran, has twice (1911 and 1918) been provoked into armed opposition to him, but the Sardar is a capi talist profiteer and no soldier, and his numerically superior following of oppressed peasantry of hirelings, mostly native of the Kishlakare no match in spirit or physique for the Savad Kuhis, the most virile of the Mazandaranis, who are loyal to Amir Muayyid. The minor personalities of Savad Kuh are all connections of his, and give him their united support. In 1910 with the aid of Amir Mukarram he defeated Amir56 Azam in Larijan at the head of a Government force sent against them from Tehran. In 1911 he assisted the ex-Shah in his attempt to return to Tehran, via. Mazandaran, but not to the extent of making any sac rifices on his behalf and obtained many rifles during the flight of Sardar Mubi’s Government troops after their defeat at Astarabad. In 1918 he organised an Ittihad-i-Tabaristan, set up a provisional Government by the Chiefs of Mazandaran, and negotiated with Salar Fatih of Kujur and with the Jangalis. He quarrelled, however, with Sardar Jalil, who was Idath to be mulcted and drawn into doubtful political ven tures which might jeopardise his huge landed estates, and the Chiefs of Mazandaran were divided into two armed camps. Amir Muayyid collected about 500 men and controlled the East of Mazandaran as far East as Sari. In addition to the Savad Kuhis he was sup ported by Hujabr-ud-Dowleh with 100 sowars of the Abdul Maliki tribe and had the sympathy of the Kurd-u-Turk leaders with the exception of Ismail Khan Isfandini. W ith the other Mazandaran Chiefs he left the province in 1919 and went to Tehran, whence ie was banished to Ivirmanshah and the Government properties in Shirgah and Aliabad were taken away fi om him. Mushir-ud-Dowleh ? s Cabinet permitted him to return from Kirmanshah to Tehran and he has re cently (November 1920) quitted Tehran and gone to Savad Kuh without permission. His sons Saifullah Khan and Hujabr-us-Sultan raised a rebellion in Savad Kuh in the early summer of 1920. Amit uaxAd is a restless and ambitious man and as he has !. e or , no Property of his own and battens on troubled times he has been the most disturbing element in Mazandaran He is personally very popular, but his sons have a bad reputation. He has usually been on a + ie Sl R ah Salar ' He concluded a 7 'nt f 1 Austrian Officer in June 1918, who fell manshlh 1 ? f and his ban ishment to Kir- manshah by Vosugh-ud-Dowleh and dislike of ordered Government have doubtless confirmed his anti-British sentiments.AMIR MUFAKHAM BAKHTIARI (q.v.) LUTF ALI KHAN.—Age about 55. Eldest member of the Ilkha- ui family and own-brother of Sardar Jang, q.v. Has held various Governorships, ineluding* Kerman and Kirmanshah. A very pious Muhammadan and a strong Governor. Took sides with the Turks against the Rus sians in 1916-17. Is not unfriendly to us. He and his brother Sardar Jang will not hurt each other if it can be avoided. Amir Mufakham is now Governor of Isfahan with the approval of Sardar Jang. Sardar Zafar (Ilkhani) being friendly with Sardar Jang ■will favour Amir Mufakham though he has a poor opinion of him. Amir Mufakham when at Kamareh (his estates) in 1915-16, w r as too long under the influence of 1 ureoxGerman agents and may therefore desert us again upon the slightest provocation. He is less to be trusted than any other of the Khans, though he may do well while in office as Governor. His influence in Bakhtiari is small, not to be com pared with that of Sardar Jang. AMIR MUHTARAM.—Born about 1855. Before the revolution he was a hanger on at the Shah’s Court and held some minor governorships, e.g., Kashan, Nahayand, and the post of “ chief of the tribes ” of Kazvin to which he was appointed for the third time in 1920. In 1918 he was shot at and wounded by the opposing democrats for welcoming Dunsterforce on their arrival at Kazvin. He has recently done some anti-Bolshevik propaganda work. AMIR MUKARRAM.—Born about 1870. He has two sons Fzam-ud-Dauleh, (Faraj Ullah Khan) and Azim-ul-Mulk, (Asad Ullah Khan). He is the son of5S Abbas Quli Khan Sardar and comes of an old Mazan- daran family owning about 60 villages in Larijan and around Am 1. He is the hereditary chief of the‘ fauj r of Larijan, which formerly numbered 800 ‘ Sarbaz r and 200 ‘ Sowars ’ and served at Astarabad, and the governorship of these districts until 1918 was held by himself or his eldest son, Fzam-ud-Dauleh. He has held no office outside Mazandaran except the governorship of Astarabad for one year. He was more or less independent of governors sent by the Persian Government to Mazandaran after the Persian revolu tion and was used on account of his family prestige by the active Amir Muaiyid (No. 42) as a figure head in the latter’s schemes in Mazandaran. He was allied with Amir Mu’aiyid against Amir A’zam’s governmental force from Tehran which was defeated in Larijan in September 1910, and in assisting the ex-Shah in his attempt to reach Tehran and recover the throne in July 1911. He afterwards continued to play the part of figure-head for Amir Muaiyid, but took no active part in Mazandaran politics. In 1919 he was expelled with the other leaders to Tehran by Zahir-ud-Mulk, Governor of Mazandaran. Amir Mukarram is considered an aristocratic degenerate with no personality and incurred ignominy by taking refuge with the Russian Consular Agent at Barfarush for protection against his creditors until himself arrested by the Russians for non-payment of a debt to the Russian Bank. He is extravagant, uxorius r and weak. AMIR MU J AH ID BAKHTIARI (q.v.). (YUSUF KHAN).—Has not held any Governorship but was Ilkhani in 1915 when he was most unsatisfactorj r to us. Has been in Europe but has not profited thereby. A ould be better out of the country altogether, but it would be extremely difficult to persuade him to go now runless perhaps to visit his son in Beirut. Professes to he Sardar Zafar’s friend since he heard of the loan of guns to him and the success against the Kuhgulus, but is secretly intriguing all the time, in league with Murtaza Quli Khan, q.v. AMIR MUQTADIR.—Formerly title of Sardar Amjad r q.v. AMIR MUWASSIGH.—Commander-in-Chief of the Per sian Government troops operating against Simko early *in 1922. AMIR KASIR—Born about 1876.

He lives in Tehran, and has a country residence at Chamarum, in the Kuhpayeh district, about 12 miles North East of Nubaran. He owns about 14 villages and is head of a family which have been hereditary officers of the “ fauj ” of Khalaj.. AMIR NIZAM {Husain Quli Khan). —Hajjilu, q.v. Eldest son of the Abdullah, Amir Nizam, whose wife was a sister of Amir Afkham. Educated in England:00 ;and speaks English and French. He and his brother, Sardar Akram, are very wealthy. Amir Nizam has taken no part in politics but has always been on good terms with the British. JLMIR NUSRAT.—Born about 1870. He is one of about 10 brothers, sons of Haji Ahmad Khan, ‘ kadkhuda ’ of the Aqsa lu subdivision of the Yangijak section of the Inanlu Shahsavan tribe. He ousted Sardar Firuz, Hidayatullah Khan, the Ilkhani, and super seded him in 1917 and subsequently when Khalilullah Khan Sarhang, of the Guqbar section, was nominated Ilkhani by the Government, Amir Nusrat refused to recognise him. Amir Nusrat’s sister is married to Samsam-i-Nizam of the Baghdadi Shahsavan. In winter and spring he resides at Faizabad, about 2 miles from Ismatabad (30 miles South of*Kazvin) and in summer in the hills of Rahmand, to the West. His original home was the Fort of Muhammad Ali Khan on the Tehran-Qum road, but he got into trouble with the Gendarmerie when they started to police this road and migrated to Valiabad in the Zahrah district of Kazvin, where he gradually made himself powerful and chief of the whole of the Yangijak. By 1913 his lawless activities caused the Gendarmerie to take action against him, but Amir Nusrat and a small party beat oft a force of gendarmeries with several casualties including one Swedish officer, and then took refuge in the hills of Rahmand out of their reach. - The Government granted him pardon and he returned to Yaliabad and increased his followers. In 1915 he joined the Muhajirin and fought with the Russians between Qum and Saveh. In 1918 he provided 200 sowars to ac company Sipah Salar from Kazvin to Tunakabun. His hostility toward^ Abbas Sultan a landowner of Do Dungeh, and their mutual raidings of each other’sCl villages was a constant source of disorder in that district in 1919-20. Owing to his opposition to the Russians in 1915 he obtained a reputation as a “ Nationalist ”, and subsequently he coquetted with a Jangalis. As an adventure in sporadic revolt against the Government he may be expected, secretly at any rate, to be anti-British. The Political officer from Kazvin was well received by him in April 1920. He owns large stock of sheep, cattle, horses and camels. • If assured of the united support of the Inanlu, and not afraid of intrigues against him, he might be able to muster 2,000 ‘ sowars ’ but 500 is probably the maximum number on which he can rely. He is a self-made man whose own ability and energy have made him Ilkhani at the expense of the neigh bouring “ Khavanin ” and the landowners from whom he requisitions grain for the maintenance of his- sowars.

His history shortly is as follows :— A member of the Central Committee in Moscow for pro paganda in the East and a well known and extremely active Communist, he was sent by the Moscow autho rities from Moscow in 1921 in company with a Persian revolutionary called Haider Khan to Gilan. Their instructions were to join Kuchik Khan and gain his confidence, taking with them arms, munitions and a band of revolutionaries. On gaining Kuchik Khan’s confidence, they were to find means of killing Kuchik Khan, thus ensuring no further opposition to the Bolsheviks on his part, as the Soviet authorities con sidered Kuchik Khan to be a pure Nationalist who would never reconcile himself to the policy of the104 Soviet authorities. Formov carried out the first part Khan hntTT 6 f the COnfldenee ^ KuS an, but on the day that he was to carry out a plan ^an'foT^ IvUch j k , Kban ’ a 3etter sent ^ Harder Khan to Formov, stating that the plan was to be Kuclfih FI ha Vi 1 | ht ’ fel1 3nt0 Kuchik K,i an’s hands.

Hemorl's .—Together with the Mandumi, the Galbaghi have for long defied the local Government ; they have turned the districts adjoining them into deserts and have been the scourge of the less turbulent people round the towns. Like the Sinjabi they have annexed lands and villages owned by old families, who are unable to draw any revenue from their possessions. In some cases, the proprietors have com promised by employing the tribesmen as agents and guards in the villages. All attempts to quell the Galbhagi and Mandumi on the part of recent Gov ernors, including one with which the Russians co operated by sending two guns, have failed. Their political attitude would be one of friendship to any Power which was strong enough to control them. On the recent visit of Colonel Kennion to Saqiz they gave Written assurances of good behaviour.100 The Galbaghi do not move to a warmer climate in the winter, but live like cuckoos in the villages from which they have ousted the inhabitants.

HASHMAT {Amir, Tubrizi ).—The Amir Hashmat whose name lias been mentioned several times of late, in con nection with the fighting between the Kurds and the Russians in Azerbaijan, is a famous fedai, and has an adventurous career. Three years ago he fought stoutly against the Russians in Tabriz, and when things got too warm for him there, he fled across the border into Turkey. Then, in the first Balkan war be joined the Ottoman forces and fought against the Bulgarians. During his sojourn m Constantinople ne was made much of both by the Persians and by the lurks; and I am told by one who knows him per sonally that he really is a very fine man, a real130 patriot and fond of adventure.

Nicholas Semino married an Armenian woman of Julfa (Ispahan) and Henri Semino is one of their children. Later Nicholas apostatized to the Mohammadan religion. The family is still under French protection. Henri Semino Avas sent to a military academy in the south of France for his education. On his return to Persia, he was employed in different posts under the Persian Government. He followed his father’s example and became a Moham madan. At one time he was attached to the suite of H. H. the Farman Farma, when the prince was Governor General of Arabistan, and while at Ker- manshah, Henri Semino met Colonel (then Captain) Gough. Later Henri Semino was in the service of the “ Maliyeh ” at Meshed.

Later Monsieur Stas, with the consent of the Ministry of Finance, gave Henri Khan employment in th e Maliyeh, which he resigned in 1915, receiving a certificate from Monsieur Moses Khan Katchatorian, the then Director of “ Maliyeh ” in Shiraz. The reason for his resigning was, that he had been given to understand that as only Persians would be employed in future, his services would not be required. Later Henri Khan was employed in teaching French in the “ Shahia ” school, and to private jmpils- On account of his bad moral reputation, some parents withdrew their children from the school : but he was not dismissed on that account, but because the school could not afford to pay his salary.

Failing to find work in Shiraz he went to Tehran about the end of 1916, and by what he has written to his family in Shiraz, gains a meagre subsistence in Tehran by teaching French to private pupils.

Kai Khusrau commands 100 horse and 000 foot, Mahmud Khan 200 horse and 2,500 foot.204 Bemarks—During the Russian occupation the frontier was usually at Garan Pass, east of Merivan, so that the tribesmen were at the mercy of the Turks and were forced to throw in their iot with them, quite irrespective of their religious sympathy with the Turks and detestation of the Russians. They have become almost a Turkish tribe. Kai Khusrau Khan and Mahmud Khan Balik are reputed to be friendly to us, but owing to their geographical position it is impossible to expect them actively to oppose the Turks unless backed by our troops. Kai Khusrau Khan, now the most influential of the chiefs, sent a favourable reply to a letter addresed to him by Colonel Kennion in July 1918. Mahmud Khan Khanisanan was said to be in correspondence with the Turks. Ali Beg visited Colonel Kennion with Mahmud Khan Dizli (see Aurumani) and gave written assurances.

Was chosen by the leaders of Seyed Zia’s coup d’etat (March 1921) as commander of the military forces, under the impression that he, then a .Colonel in the Cossack Division and considered to be an ignorant upstart, could be easily disposed of when he had done his work.

Contrary to most Persians he has a direct manner of speech, and a somewhat rough tongue if aroused. He is considerably less venal than most of his compatriots, and does not appear to let monetary considerations affect his judgment. * Though most ambitious, he appears to be a serious patriot whose chief object is to extricate Persia from the difficulties into which the country has fallen and raise it to the status of a strong and independent power. This he is anxious to achieve by Persia’s own efforts, as he is greatly opposed to any form of foreign interference. Owing to In's forceful personality and- rough tongue he is held in considerable awe by all Persians with whom he comes in contact.

He went when a ooy to Azarbaijan where through the assistance of an uncle who was a minor official, he worked his way up and344 was twice Governor of Salmas. On his return from Azarbaijan to Tehran he was sent as agent to an estate near Kirmanshah and made the most of his facilities for money making, until, on detection he fled back to Tehran and entered the service of Sipah Salar, went with Amir Asad to Tunakabun, and was appointed by him Ilkhani of the Khwajahvand tribe (see Chapter 4HI), which post he held for one year. He accom panied Sipah Salar in 1909 wlien Sipah Salar went to Azarbaijan, quarrelled with Ain-ud-Dauleh, went off to Gilaji, became head of the Mujahidin, and marched to Tehran. Salar Fatih was in charge of a party of 70 men and on route killed the Shaikh-ul-Islam at Kazvin. Yeprim held a high opinion of his courage and he receiv ed the title of Salar Fatih from Sipah Salar, who had previously in Azarbaijan promoted him Sartip. In 1911 he was second-in-command and profited by the exactions of the notorious Urdu-i-Barg, which went via Kujur to Mazandaran after the flight of Muhamma AH, the ea;-Shah. Yeprim on his departure to Azar baijan in 1912 left Salar Fatih as chief of the police, which he (Yeprim) had newly organized in Tehran, but after 7 months he was dismissed for coining counterfeit money. In 1911 Sipah Salar when Premier sent Salar Fatih as Governor of Burujird, Nahavand, and Tusirkhan. He was dismissed after one year and re mained out of work until 1915.

Salar Fatih undertaking to go and foster rebellion in Kujur, Kuehik Khan undertaking to do the same in Gilan, and they agreed subsequently to join forces. Salar Fatih returned with the other refugees to Kujur, expelled Sipah Salar s agents at once from Kujur, and two months later from Pul. In the summer of 1916 when European children and women were preparing to evacuate Tehran before the Turkish advance from Hamadan, he invited them to go via Kujur. In 1918 and 1919 he was leader of the Kujuris in their forays into Tunakabun and although not a member of the “ II ” of Khwajahvand its leaders were guided by him as the more skilful intriguer. In 1918 he went on from Khurramabad in Tunakabun to Kasma to confer with Mirza Kuehik Khan and the Jangali leaders. In the summer of 1919 he was threatened by a Cossack force from Tunakabun, but refused to come to Tehran until he received a guarantee of safety, Taminameb, countersigned by the British Legation.

His rapacity was not limited to Sipah Salar's property and he is hated by the people of the lowlands of Kalaristaq and of Tunarkabun .for the losses they sus tained at the hands of the Kujuris under his leader ship. His career is of interest as an illustration of how a peasant lad can rise to position and power, of the Persian attri butes of intrigue and ingratitude, and as a type of the adventurer to whom the disorganization resulting from the revolution has afforded special facilities and im punity.

The eldest of the Bakhtiari Khans. He lived with the tribe until 1908 when he seized Isfahan, of which he was appointed Governor by the Constitutionalist Government in 1909. He joined Sardar Asad as joint leader of the 1909 march of the Bakhtiaris to Tehran where they joined Sipah Salar and compelled Muhammad Ali Shah to abdicate. He took subsequently a prominent part in Tehran politics becoming Prime Minister in 1911. In 1913 he became the leader of the anti-British element among the Bakhtiaris due to the establishment, with the approval of Great Britain, of the Gendarmerie under Swedish officers in the Isfahan district of South Persia, bordering on Bakhtiari land, which they regarded as their own sphere and resented the presence of non- Bakhtiari armed forces in those regions. The hostility between Gendarmerie and Bakhtiaris grew so strong that in 1914 fighting between them nearly broke out in Tehran, where, since their participation in the expulsion of Muhammad Ali Shah in 1909, contingents of Bakhtiari sowars had always been stationed. During the early days of the war Samsam, while taking money from the British Legation, set to work on behalf of our enemies. He did not, like some of the younger Bakhtiari Khans, leave Tehran with the “ Muhajirin ” in November 1915 and of necessity kept quiet until the Russian revolution and withdrawal of Russian troops from Persia, but after these events he seized his opportunity, by German aid was elected a Tehran deputy for the Majlis by the Democrats in 1918 and started an open and violent anti-British propaganda. Soon after in return for a present of 15,000 tumans the Shah appointed him Governor of Khorasan, but,354 owing to opposition aroused, the appointment was cancelled, and to avoid refund of the cash, the Shah made him Premier after the acquiescence of the British Legation had been obtained on Samsam’s undertaking to stop his anti-British activities—a promise, however, which he immediately broke and proceeded to select his Ministers from among the notable opponents of Great Britain. The hostility of the Cabinet increased with news of the great German attack on the French front, the advance of the Turk from Tabriz towards Zinjan, and of the Jangalis to Manjil. It declared all treaties made with Russia during the last 100 years abrogated, and can celled the extra territorial rights, which subjects of European powers have in Persia, on the basis of the treaty of Turkomanchai akin to the rights they have under the “ Capitulations ” in Turkey, e.g., exemption from taxes, and right of trial before their consular representatives. The situation was critical, until the arrival of British troops at Kazvin and the withdrawal of the Turks towards Tabriz enabled Sir C. Marling, the British Minister, to demand of the Shah the dis missal of the Cabinet. Samsam at first refused to relinquish office, but finally the Cabinet fell and Vusuq- ud-Dauleh came into power with British support on the 7th August 1918. .He is a weak minded old man verging on his dotage, an obstinate uneducated tribesman, unable to speak or write Persian properly. Member of the Kemalist party in Tehran early in 1922. 8ANI-UD-DOWLETT {Murtaza Quli JO,an) .—From 1876- 1884 he was being educated in Berlin. In 1888 he married a daughter of Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah.

SARDAR JALIjj (Lutf Ah Khan Kulbadi). —Former title _ Salar Mukarram. Born about 1860. Son of Haji Muttaza Quli Khan Sultan. His eldest son bhuku-i-Nizam, aged about 20, is a nonentity, Sardar Jahl is second of the big “three” in Mazandaran viz Amir Muaiyid, Sardar Jalil and Amir Mukar ram. The two Amirs have always been allies and since th e revolution have had control of the West of ^ Mazandaran. Amir Mu’aiyid has twice, in 1911 and MIS, been the aggressor against, and come to blows- with Sardar Jail who controls the East of the pro vince as far West as Sari and is supported by Mas’ud- ul-Mulk, Salarafkliam and Sardar Rafi, the landowners of Hazar Jarib (upper Tejea area).6 ARDAR JALTL is a self-made man. He was a petty hereditary officer of the 100 ‘sowars’ of the Kulbad district, a few miles East of Ashraf, which before the revolution were usually stationed in Astarabad. He inherited a small property and married a cousin who became heiress to the villages of Kulbad by the con venient death of her brother soon after her marriage. He set to work to acquire land by the usual tricks -of the Persian landowner, i.e., squeezing his peasantry, cutting off the irrigation water, and making things so unpleasant for smaller owners that they were obliged to part with their lands on his terms, and he is charged with putting out of the way persons inconvenient to him. Authorship is attributed to Sardar Jalil of the system of Shahmii’zadi, by which the monopoly of a village shop was granted to a lessee, and the villagers were forbidden to sell their cotton, etc., to anybody else and were obliged to buy from him their sugar, tea, and other requirements. The shopkeeper consequently was master of the situation, bought cheap and sold dear and paid a high rent to the landlord for the monopoly. These shopkeepers were mostly natives of the district of Shahmirzad near Samnan, hence the name. By such means Sardar Jalil gradually . acquired very large estates, said to amount to 50 villages, between Kulbad and Sari, centred round his residence at Naran- ji Bagh by the bridge over the Nikah on the Ashraf-Sari road, and is one of the wealthiest men in Northern Persia. Money making is his pursuit and while averse to paying taxes, he has no taste for politics and still less for soldiering. In 1911 he did not join the er-Shah, who was welcomed to Mazandaran by Amir Mu’aiyid and Amir Mukarram and fled to Tehran. Subsequently he joined the Ittihad-i-Tabaristan and was appointed by it Gover nor of Mazandaran, but he appears to have been pushed into the Ittihad by the adventurous Amir Muaiyid and to have been a very lukewarm adherent of It. He soon fell foul of Amir Mu’aiyid who wanted367 is a jKttj ;le Itii Wore | abai He oosij tin ' ti- mania^ W trifk leasaitrj, ig digs reoHigeii selaijeii ffliait (a e system a iage !ers w else tea, d ntijH i ter oao|»ly, fctrift !il very beta Nam- 'af-Sari ortkni irbie Dobfe leonteii :arrau ] ie lOTff- beffl imir it ft iaty his money, and in 1918 Mazahdaran was divided into two armed camps. Sardar Jalil in self-defence col lected about 900 men around Sari and Naranji Bagh, 000 of them from his own estates and 300 brought fiom Hazar Jarib, but this force, which was composed .chiefly of oppressed peasantry and hirelings of the ryishlaq was no match for the 400 stalwart Savad Ivulns genuinely attached to Amir Mu’aiyid. Sardar Jalil was disarmed and exiled to Tehran with the other khavanin by Zaliir-ul-Kulk, Governor of Mazandaran. In 1919 he asked to be made a British subject, and in September 1920, through the good offices of the British Legation with the Persian Government, he was permitted to go back to Mazan daran. Sardar Jalil ils a Baha’i, closely related to Sardar Razi but has the worst reputation for meanness and oppres sion of any landowner in this area, and many ugly and apparently authentic stories of murder are current about him. fie is enormously stout and of repulsive appear an'•e SARDAR JANG BAKHTIARI (q.v.)

He is now working entirely with us, and excepting Sardar Zafar, the only one of the senior Khans whom we could trust with a responsible position.

He is head of a family which have been feudal lords of Tunakabun from the end of the 18th century, when Agha Muhammad Khan, Kajar, granted governorship and estates to Mehdi Khan Tunakabuni, the founder of the family. Their influence increased and during the life-time of Habibullah Khan, Sa’id-ud-Dauleh, father of Sipah Salar, the districts of Kalaristaq and Kalardasht and subsequently of Kujur were grouped with the gover norship of Tunakabun, which remained within this family. Habibullah Khan and more especially Sipah Salar acquired property in these districts. The Khawajahvand tribe and others resented this land grabbing. Disturbances started in 1914 and in 1918-19 the Kujuris under Salar Fatih Shuja-i-Nizam and his brother twice reached Khurramabad in Tunakabun and looted Sipah SalaFs estates. The sons of Sipah Salar by their intrigues against each other and their father for the management of the estates fostered these troubles.401 Born aboii SipaMar-i- )15.

Tbe l this tal d in 1918-15 am and to lakabun aad Sipah Sato their fate stered tte Sipah Salar inherited practically the whole of his father’s property to the exclusion of his relatives. He is pos sessed with a mania for the acquisition of land and is considered the biggest landowner in Persia. In ad dition to his Tunakabun estates with parks at Khurramabad and Shahsavar, he owns property in Gilan, most of which has been confiscated by Jangalis and Bolsheviks, in Rudbar and in other parts of Kaz- rin province, which produce much grain, in Tehran, Iraq and elsewhere. Owing to losses sustained at the hands of Kujuris, Jangalis, and Bolsheviks, and the slump in rice owing to impossibility of export to Russia, he is said to be •short of cash. He commenced his career in military service and then held many offices including the gov ernorship of Talish 1877-78, of Astarabad 1889, of Gilan from 1899* to 1903, of Ardabil in 1904, of Gilan in 1907, of Astarabad in 1907. In August 1908 he was sent by Muhammad Ali Shah to command the Royalist troops beseiging the Revolution aries in Tabriz, but fell into disagreement with Ain- ud-Dauleh and with the Shah and abandoned his com mand, appeared before Enzeli in February 1909, when the revolutionaries killed the Governor, and chose him Governor in defiance of the Shah. In April 1909 he proceeded to Kazvin as nominal commander of the re volutionary army of which Yeprim the Armenian is generally supposed to have been the leading spirit, and entered Tehran simultaneously with the Bakhtiaris on 13th July 1909, when he dictated terms to Muham mad Ali Shah. After the deposition of Muhammad Ali. he was appointed Prime Minister and held office for almost a year. He was reappointed Premier in March 1911, left Tehran in a fit of temper on June 15tu 1911 for Rasht in consequence of a disagreement with the Majlis and Cabinet, but returned to Tehran m July 9th and remained in office until July 24th. * During this period he constructed the Rudishor- Dahij an-R osht-Kasmaroad.402 By this period his relations with the Nationalists had become strained, he took no steps against the c.r-SLah who was threatening Tehran from Mazandaran and was roundly accused of treachery. He was Minister of War in 1915 and Prime Minister for the third time from March to August 1916, when the Russian troops under General Baratoff were in the country, and he did exactly as he was told. On 5th August 1916 he signed a note granting control of Persian finances to a British and Russian Commission and Anglo-Russian control of two forces, each of 11,000 men, for North and South Persia under Russian and British officers respectively. When the Turks occupied Hamadan in August 1916 he deemed it advisable to withdraw from public life and retired to Kazvin. In 1919 he was Governor-General of Azarbaijan, where, until recalled to Tehran, he stirred up trouble against Vusuq-ud-Dauleh, the Prime Minister, with whom he was on bad terms. He is an impetuous, flighty, eccentric old grandee, at one time Constitutionalist and at another Reactionary, not lacking in vigour but quite irresponsible. He has the courage of his convictions but owing to his inconstancy of mind is not taken seriously. He is rapacious like the rest of his class. During his Premiership he robbed on a grand scale and for several years his estates have jmid no taxes to the Government. His huge property is in the provinces which were the centre of Russian influence, so it was to his interest to be pro-Russian. After the fall of Russia his enmity tvith Vusuq-ud-Dauleh tended to prevent his becom ing pro-British, but after the Bolshevik inroad no other alternative was left to him. He was primarily responsible for the coup d’ etat of February, 192i, which led to the formation of Zia-ed-Din’s Cabinet, but it was his intrigues which brought about Zia-ed-Din’s fall. He remained as V ar Minister in the Cabinsts of Qawam us-Saltaneh and Mushir-ud-Douleh, but continued to be403 wmaiBts y . . . tlie Commander-in-Chief also. During this period he andaran crushed Kuchik Khan and the Muhammad Taqi rebel 's Ministg lion in Khorasan, and also undertook the reorganisa- he third t® tion of the Persian forces into one uniform army. By asian troop his strength of character and his powerful position as Dtr y, aadt, sole controller of all the armed forces in Persia he gust 15 [ became at the end of 1921 the one powerful factor in n finances I the country and in times of crisis virtually a dictator.

His surrender was refused by the tribe, but after the successful operations undertaken against them by Kalhurs and Sardar Rashid he was eventually captured and exiled to India. His arrest on Persian soil aroused an outcry among anti-British elements, the Jangalis for instance declaring they would only give up Captain Noel, whom they had kidnapped at En- zali, in exchange for Sulaiman Mirza.
