It is not proposed in this meinorundum to enter in any detail into the internal history of the Trucial States, but rather to deal in a general way with the developments which have taken place in the last 20 years, and tne problems presented by the States as matters stand to-day. 2. The Trucial Chiefs—so-called on account of the treaties of maritime truce concluded by them between 1820 and 1853 with His Majesty’s Government, under which a check was imposed on their internecine strife and their piratical and slaving activities in the Gulf—are the Sheikhs of Ras-al-Khaima, Umm-al-Qaiwain, Ajman, Shargah, Dabai, Abu Dhabi and El Katr. The last-named Principality, the history of which between 1908 and 1916 is separately dealt with in the Note on p. ^ was added to the number of the Trucial States consequent on the conclusion* on 3rd November 1916 of a treaty between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government, under which His Majesty’s Government recognised the independence of El Katr and, in return for certain undertakings, extended to it the benefit of the guarantees contained in the Trucial Treaties. The territory ruled over by the Trucial Sheikhs at the present day lies on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf, between the west side of the Promontory of El Katr (or Qatar) and approximately the north point of the Musandim Promontory in Oman (compare Map 11 appended to this Memorandum). 3. The Trucial States remain independently administered tribal princi palities, governed by independent Arab Sheikhs. The Trucial Treaties (the substance of which is given in the precis of treaty engagements printed as an Appendix to this Memorandum) accord to the contracting parties the right to accredit a representative on the one side at the headquarters of the several Chiefs, and on the other at the British Residency at Bushire ; but in practice the Chiefs have no representatives, and His Majesty’s Government are represented only by a native agent of the Residency at Bushire, who is stationed at Shargah, on the Trucial Coast, and moves from place to place as required. 4. Responsibility for the political control of the States rested up to the end of the war with the Government of India. The Masterton-Smith Committee made no specific reference to them, but, on the general principle underlying the recommendations of that Committee, the affairs of the States would appear to continue to be primarily the concern of the Government of India, subject to the ultimate control of His Majesty’s Government, save when they involve or touch on major questions of policy involving relations with Ibn Sand, or affecting the Arabian policy of His Majesty’s Government. In that case they fall to be dealt with directly by His Majesty’s Government through the Colonial Cilice. 5. Save in respect of the Residency Agent at Shargah, there appears to be no political expenditure in connection with the Sheikhs. No subsidies are or have been paid to any of their number, although the grant of a subsidy to the Sheikh of El Katr was considered and ultimately rejected in connection with the negotiation of the treaty concluded with him on the 3rd November 1916.| II.—Internal History, 1908-28. 6. The internal history of the Trucial States in the last 20 years is of no general interest or importance, and it is unnecessary to recapitulate it here. The incident of most importance in the pre-war period was an undertaking by the Sheikhs not to give pearling or sponge fishing concessions,J save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government. During the war the Sheikhs adopted a friendly attitude ; and, broadly speaking, they have satisfactorily implemented their engagements to His Majesty’s Government in matters such as the arms trallic and the slave trade. His Majesty’s 'Government have consistently avoided entanglement in their internal affairs, 3091a 75 10.28 A P. 268/17. t Tel. from S. of S. for I. to Viceroy, Sept. 9 1915, P.3296/15.

In view of the importance of the oil question it should be placed on ® record that the Trucial Sheikhs of Shargah, Ras-al-Khaima, Dabai, Abu Dhabi, Ajman and Umm-al-Qaiwain agreed in 1022 not to grant a concession in the event of oil being found in their territories, save with the permission of His Majesty s Government. No question of a concession has so far arisen. ( onsiderable discussion has, however, taken place between the Sheikh of El Katr (who is precluded by Article 5 of his Treaty of 3rd December 1916 from granting any concession without the approval of His Majesty’s Government), and various oil interests affected in regard to the grant of a concession in his territory; and an option for 18 months in which to negotiate for an oil concession was granted by him to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in March 1926. The negotiations have throughout been conducted under the close supervision and with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. III.—External Developments affecting the Trucial Sheikhs, 1908-28. 8. The developments in relation to the Sheikhs of most importance during the period now in question have been external. They are (а) The rise of Ibn Saud. (б) The recent reassertion of Persian authority in the Persian Gulf. Ibn Saud and the Trucial Sheikhs. 9. As will be seen from the Foreign Office Memorandung of 1908 the Wahabi connection with the Trucial Coast is of long standing, althoimh for many years prior to 1913 it had ceased to be of any political importance. Put the conquest of Ifasa by Ibn Saud in 1913 again brought the Wahabi movement directly in touch with the Trucial Sheikhs.- To' their territory as to El Katr, Ibn Saud maintained a hereditary claim. He was, however’ warned by . the Political Resident of the special treaty relations between His Majest\ s Government and the Irucial Sheikhs,j* and he maintained an entilely correct attitude towards them during the following years. Py the treaty of 26th December 1915, Ibn Saud undertook to abstain from aggression on or interference with the Trucial Sheikhdoms, or with El Kati, + and that instrument formally governed his relations with the States until the conclusion of the Treaty of Jeddah in the spring of 1927. 10. No incident of importance appears to have arisen as between Ibn oaud and the Irucial States until after the European W ar. In 1921§ the Sheikh of El Katr represented that he was alarmed at the prospect of some of his townspeople becoming Akhwan and joining Ibn Saud, and asked whether Government would help him should he be attacked from the interior. He was informed in reph’’ that Government were not prepared to promise more than diplomatic assistance should he be attacked by Ibn Saud. At the end ol 1922 the Sheikh again represented!! that, while he did not eai an open attack by Ibn Saud so long as the latter remained on good terms with His Majesty’s Government, he was seriously alarmed by the more subtle methods employed, he alleged, by the Nejd authorities to make Ins position impossible. The Political Resident commented that he did not see any practicable means to prevent peaceful penetration of the country by tie Akhwan and Ibn Sand’s adherents. He suggested that a hint might be given to Ibn Saud to keep his people in order. No action was taken on t ns proposal. Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner in Iraq, reporting!! that, on finding that Ibn Saud was apparently including the Katr Peninsula within the tract of country for which he was prepared to negotiate an oil concession he had already very recently “ taken him to task, reminding him p n ? tlun £ to ( 1° Katr, except to respect it, under the terms oi ms treaty with us, and insisting on the limitation of his discussions to the coun ry west of the longitude of Salwah Hay, His Highness accepted this injunction without argument.” The Sheikh has maintained his independence.3 though it transpired in the air reconnaissance cf the Gulf in 1927 that he attaches great importance to avoiding action which might be unpalatable to the Wahabi King. 11. The activity of the Wahabis again came prominently to notice in 1926. The Political Resident then reported 00 that of the Trueial Chiefs, the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Dabai, together with a number of the tribes under their suzerainty or adjoining their territory, were whole-heartedly opposed to Ibn Sand ; that the Sheikhs of Shargah and Ras-al-Khaima were definitely supporters of the Wahabi King; and that the Sheikhs of Ajman and CJmin al Qaiwain were inclined to be neutral. In a number of instances the Wahabi Governor of Ilasa, Jbu Jiluwi, appeared to have acted in an extremely high-handed manner in the Trucial Sheikhdoms, and the Political Resident was inclined to the view that he aimed at the absorption in Nejd of all Trucial Oman and “ Independent” Oman (Jau), and at the establish ment of contact with a large district of the Oman Sultanate which was opposed to the Imam and almost independent of the Sultan. 12. An element of doubt existed as to the extent to which Ibn Sand was personally responsible for. or even cognisant of, the activities of the Governor of Hasa ; it was decided, after considerable discussion, that no action should be taken in the matter pending the conclusion of the new treaty then in negotiation with him ;|t and the assurances secured in that treaty from the King were ultimately held to dispose of the matter. 13. The Government of India were strongly in favour of the inclusion in the treaty in question of an undertaking as regards the Trucial Chiefs substantially identical with that embodied in the Treaty of 26th December 1915 (see para. 9 above). It proved impossible to secure Ibn Sand’s agreement to this His Majesty’s Government regarded the point as one which it was undesirable to press too far, and in the result the King of the Hejaz and Nejd, in the treaty signed at Jeddah on 20th May 1927, undertook merely “ to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with . . . the Sheikhs of Katr and the Oman coast who are in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government.” 14. The result of the reconnaissance undertaken in connection with the air route in the Persian Gulf along the north Arabian shore in the spring of 1927 was to show that the influence of Ibn Sand had increased in a very marked manner along the north Arabian littoral, and considerable difficulties were placed in the way of the reconnaissance on the ground, either expressed or implied, that political difficulties would be causer! with the Wahabis and the Wahabi King by the landing of aeroplanes, Ac. (cp. Note on Air Communications in the Gulf on p. £|). So impressed was the Political Resident by the rise of the Wahabi power and by the insecurity to which a chain of air stations along the Arab coast might be expased by internal dissensions and the danger of Wahabi interference in the petty Sheikhdoms of the Trucial Coast, that in the spring of 1927 he suggested 0 that the long-established policy of abstention by His Majesty’s Government from all but naval commitments should now be discarded and replaced by a definite assumption of responsibility in the States concerned for the orderly succession of Sheikh to Sheikh, for his maintenance in power, and for the protection of his territories by land as well as by sea. 15. The Government of India gave careful and sympathetic consideration to the Resident’s proposals. But the conclusion at which they finally arrived! was that, even though the guarantees of non-interference given by Ibn Sand in the Treaty of Jeddah of 1927 fell considerably short of those which he had been prepared to accept in 1915, they conveyed to the King of the Hejaz a clear intimation, solemnly accepted by him, of the special position and of the interest in the Trucial Sheikhdoms of His Majesty’s Government. Past history, in the view of the Government of India, justified them in relying for security against the danger of Wahabi encroachments on the treaty engagements into which Ibn Saud had entered with His Majesty’s Government, and, while it was impossible to forecast the effect on Gulf politics of the death of Ibn Saud, they were not prepared, in these^circum stances, to make an immediate reversal of their policy in the Persian Gulf Letter from Pol.

The reassertion of Persian Authority in the Persian Gulf. 16 It is only in the last two years that Persia has commenced to adopt an active policy in.the Gulf. The result of the adoption of that policy has been to bring her into conflict on certain points with ti e I racial L hiels and their interests. The Trucial settlements on the south Persian coast, the occupation of Henjam for so many years by Fracial Arabs, the J racial ownership of the islands of Tamb, Little Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirn the title to which of the Sheikhs of Shargah and Uas-al-Khaima is contested by Persia, have all afforded grounds of friction. 17. The three most important incidents which have arisen are the expulsion by Persia of the Sheikh of Henjam in May 192S, the airest in .Inly 1928 of a Trucial dhow plying between Dabai and Khassab, which raised the question of the status of Tamb, and—a direct consequence of the last-named incident—the questioning by Persia of the independence of the Trucial owners of Tamb. 18. The history of the expulsion of the Sheikh of Henjam is given in paras. 28 to 34 of the Memorandum on llenjam on page Q. The incident was one the disposal of which would, in all probability, have presented relatively little difficulty, had it been possible to localise it But the Sheikh of Henjam is the father-in-law of the Trucial Sheikh of Bahai; and he and his people are by race Jowasimi Arabs, who claim never to have accepted Persian nationality, and who maintain very close relations with their fellow tribesmen on the north Arabian shore.As a result, disturbances in flenjam react immediately on feeling on the Trucial ('oast, and in the present instance the effect of the expulsion of the Sheikh was, according to the Senior Naval Officer, so greatly to excite the Trucial Arabs that they had stated that were it not for “the British action and our gunboats, they would come in thousands, seize Kishm Island and Hen am, and kill every Persian on the islands.”! Representations in the strongest terms were made to the Residency Agent and the Political Resident, and Sir Lionel Haworth reported that he had been informed by the brother of the Sheikh of Dabai, whom he describes as one of the most level-headed and sensible chiefs on the Tmcial Coast, that “ if we did nothing to help them, they were prepared to tear up our treaties, much as they liked them, have done with our air route and kill all Persian officials they could and massacre all Persians on the Arab coast.” X 1.0. to F.O., June 23 1928, P. 3178.

As will be seen from the Memorandum on Henjam, it was agreed, in the early stages of this incident, that the intervention of His Majesty’s (government at lehran on behalf of the Sheikh would do more harm than good.! The strength of feeling aroused on the Arab littoral, and the danger- emphasised by the Political Resident—that the Trucial Arabs might have recourse to Ibn Saud should His Majesty’s Government, while failino- !i cT -fv t V“ te , rv . ene effectively on behalf of the Sheikh, refuse to allow the feneikh or Dabai to approach the Persian Government regarding him hay 0 since, however, led the Government of India to modify their”view’ Attention has also been drawn by the Colonial Office to the difficulties which uo a Id arise were the Tmcial Arabs to become supporters of Ibn Sand, and iihile for the moment the return of the Sheikh to Henjam at the invitation of the Persian Government gives hope that a satisfactory solution of the incident may be found, reconsideration of the decision of His Majesty's Government not to intervene, with Persia may be called for should this5 unfoi tunately prove not to be the case (cp. para. 39 of Memorandum on Henjam on page 0). The incident, and its reactions on the Trucial Coast, on which as the Government of India remarked, “ anti-Persian feeling is always a matter of concern to us, and any anti-Persian ebullition might lead to serious embarrassment,”® illustrate, in any event, the difficulty of the * Tel. from viceroy, situation to which action, however justified, by Persia may give rise, where m^p’siT 18 the Trucial Arabs are concerned. ‘ &gt; • '• 20. The Tamb incident is dealt with in paras. 33 and 34 of the Memorandum on the Status of Tamb, &amp;c„ on p. “ Jt will be seen that it was with great difficulty that the Sheikhs affected by the Persian arrest of the dhow in question were restrained from undertaking reprisals against Persia; that the Persian claim to the islands of Tamb and Abu Musa which have been recognised by His Majesty’s Government as Trucial territories remains to be disposed of, and that the question of compensation to the bheikhs and to the owner of the dhow and his passengers is still unsettled. Persia and the independence of the Trucial Chiefs. 21. £he newspaper Habl-id-Matin, which is understood to derive Tei. from Poi. inspiration from the juglicst (juartors, so long 3^0 &amp;s JS^ovcinbGr 19^7 R e8 *fc°s. ot s. included in a list of Persian desiderata the “renewal of the Protectorate of ^ 7 Sept ' 25 1928 &gt; Persia oyer Muscat and other small Sheikhs of the coast of Oman.” The fust official indication of a I ersian claim of this nature arose, however in connection with the Tamb incident in August 1928, when the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs formally stated in a Note that “ the Persian Government Teh. tei. to f.o, cannot recognise as independent and owner of the said islands ” the Sheikh pV-o *' 31 1928 ’ on whose behalf representations have been made by His Majesty’s Government, and added that in consequence “ my Government cannot in any way approve the attitude that the British Government have adopted on the pretext of having treaties with the above-mentioned Sheikh, and cannot accept resultino- •declaration which you make of protecting him.” &amp; 22. The Note left room for doubt as to whether the Persian challenge of the independence of the Sheikh in question was directed to his status as legalds lamb and Abu Musa, to which a claim is preferred by Persia or to his status as a Trucial Chief on the Arab Coast. The Charge d’Affaires at Teheran was, however, instructed in reply to communicate officially the text of the Exclusive Agreement of 1892 with all the Trucial Chiefs, and to state that His Majesty’s Government entirely failed to understand the Persian statement, and could not admit direct dealings between the Chiefs and the^ Persian Government. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added, “ You will realise that vis-d-vis of Foreign Powers, there is no distinction for a purpose like the present between the Sheikh of Ras-al- Khaima and the other Trucial Chiefs, and effect of Persian Note is to s^t.'fiS. challenge oui light to protect any of them from external aggression the status of 11 is Majesty s Government on the Arabian coast is not open to discussion, nor can they recognise any Persian claim on that side of the Gulf.” 23. A leisian reply, holding to the views expressed in their earlier Note and adding that “all agreements made with Trucial Chiefs which harm or limit the lights and interests of Persia cannot be recognised as valid or legally be cited as reason for measures against Persian Government ” has since been leceiyed. The Political Resident reports, moreover, that the Governor of Bushire is alleged to have received instructions from Teheran that Persia recognises no Arab rulers on the Arab coast of the Gulf and that all persons belonging to and arriving from Katr and the Trucial Coast (as from Muscat, Koweit and Bahrein) are to be considered Persian subjects and Persian passports issued to them. It seems clear in the circumstances that the possibility of a formal claim by Persia to suzeraintv on the Trucial Coast whether based on her temporary control of portions of that coast in the early eighteenth century! or on intrigues such as that unsuccessfully undertaken t Lor. i, «3i. by the Sartip on her behalf in 1887,+ and subsequently repudiated bv the Persian Government, cannot be ignored. The seriousness of the issues to t Lor -&gt;\ 737. which such a claim would give rise, if pressed, needs no emphasis. Teh. tel. 27S, Sept. 21 1028, P. 5159. Tel. from I'ol.

The extension to the coast of the authority of Ibn Sand and the influence of the Wahabi movement, the reassertion of Persian authority in ’ the Persian Gulf, and the question of an Imperial air route along the north Arabian coast, have combined to invest the Trucial Sheikhdoms with a new importance. If the air route is to materialise ; if Ilis Majesty’s Government,. ® in the light of the report of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee, remain of the opinion that the maintenance of British influence in the Gulf is a matter of paramount importance, alike from the Imperial and from the Indian standpoint; and if they are no longer.to enjoy on the south Persian coast the privileged position which they have enjoyed in the past ; then the consoli dation of their influence on the north Arabian shore is a matter of verv much greater and more definite importance than at any earlier period. 25. If, however, that influence is to be maintained and consolidated, the fact that the Trucial Chiefs are guaranteed (even though to an extent difficult precisely to define) the protection of ilis Majesty’s Government, and are forbidden to communicate with outside Powers or to receive their representatives, necessitates a clear understanding as to the extent to which Bis Majesty’s Government are in a position and are prepared to defend their interests, whether against Persia or against Ibn Sand. 26. Of the two, Persia presents the less serious problem. Even should she seriously put forward claims to suzerainty on the Arab coast, she is not,, as matters stand, in a position to enforce them, nor could His Majesty’s Government acquiesce in her pursuit of an active policy of aggression on the north Arabian coast, any more than in those Trucial islands in the Gulf which they have recognised as vested in the Trucial Chiefs, 'without resiling from the policy which they have hitherto consistently pursued. Moreover, the Trucial Sheikhs and their tribesmen are bound to Persia by ties neither of race nor of religion, while the north Arabian shore (as distinct from the Trucial islands, certain of which appear to contain valuable mineral deposits) offers no commercial or pecuniary reward to justify an active Persian interest. 27. Ibn Saud, and the Wahabi movement of which he is the representative, constitute a much more serious problem. In the first place, in the words of Sheikh Hamad of Bahrein, Ibn Saud is “the one big Arab ruler, and it is natural for all the smaller Arab Sheikhs ... to look up to him and try to please him Historically, he has claims of standing to a predominant influence on the Trucial Coast, and geographically his extension to that coast would, but for the presence of His Majesty’s Government, be a natural process. The special tenets of the Wahabi creed are familiar to the Trucial tribesmen; certain at any rate of the Trucial Sheikhdoms are traditionally strongly Wahabi in outlook; while racially the Trucial Arabs and the W ahabis of the interior descend from common stocks. 28. It is clear that in these circumstances the problem of preventing the absorption of the Trucial Sheikhdoms by Ibn Saud or their gradual penetration by Wahabi influence is one of great difficulty, the more so in view of the known Wahabi sentiments of certain of the Trucial Sheikhs. The danger of possible military aggression by the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd may be discounted so long as his general relations with Ilis Majesty’s Government remain friendly, and the Government of India have already expressed the view (see para. 15 above) that they are justified, in the light of past history, in relying for security against the danger of Wahabi encroachments on the treaty engagements into which Ibn Saud has entered with His Majesty’s Government. But while this is true of an aggressive military policy, it appears almost impossible for His Majesty’s Government effectively to prevent the penetration by peaceful means of the Frucial States by Ibn Saud and his adherents —a process the more difficult to combat for the reasons given in the preceding paragraph. ^ 29. As matters stand, the most that it appears possible for His Majesty s Government usefully to do is to arrange for the showing of the flag by His Majesty s ships along the Trucial Coast, possibly to a greater extent even than at present; to construe in a strict sense the undertakings given byoo 7 Ibn Sand in the Treaty of Jeddah of 1927 ; and to keep a close watch for action, whether prompted by Ibn Sand himself or the independent work of over-zealous lieutenants, which can be regarded as calling for remonstrance, in view of the terms of the treaty. The value of the constant reminder of British power which is given by a naval patrol cannot be exaggerated ; the importance of the support of His Majesty's ships to a ruler threatened by a fanatical hinterland has been illustrated in recent years, though in different circumstances, in Muscat. The establishment of an air route, should His Majesty’s Government decide upon that course, will go some way towards the assertion on the north Arabian coast of the influence of His Majesty’s Government. The payment of subsidies to the Chiefs, should that prove ultimately unavoidable, in connection with the establishment of air stations, may further be of value in consolidating British influence ; the elimination of British influence from the south Persian shore, and the possibility that Persia may question the retention of the Residency at Bushire, may lead to a reconsideration of political arrangements in the Gulf, one effect of which would be to fix the headquarters of the Resident on or near the Arabian littoral of the Gulf; but while for the moment the objections urged by the Government of India to the adoption of the policy of active intervention in the affairs of the Trucial Coast suggested by the Political Resident (para. 1J above) appear conclusive, the possibility that at some later stage consideration of that policy may be necessitated by developments which cannot at present be foreseen, is one which must be faced. 30. To sum up. His Majesty’s Government by their treaty engagements control the foreign relations of the Trucial Chiefs, to whom, in addition, they have promised either directly or by implication a degree of protection which it is difficult precisely to define. Their written engagements to the Chiefs have been supplemented by utterances such as that made by Lord Curzon, when Viceroy of India, on his visit to the Gulf in 1903, an appeal to the terms of which has so recently as the summer of the present year' ::: * been made by certain of the Chiefs affected. The original reason for contracting the engagements in question was the suppression of piracy, the slave traffic and the arms traffic, and the preservation of the maritime peace of the Gulf. In the changed circumstances of the present day, those arguments for the maintenance of a predominant British influence are supplemented by the wider political considerations referred to in para. 21 above. But the change in the general situation which has made the maintenance of British influence on the Trucial Coast of greater general importance from the Indian and the Imperial point of view is accompanied by the probable necessity of facing wider liabilities, or of interpreting in a more generous or a more binding manner the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the defence of the interests of the Sheikhs protected. V.—Points referred to in connection with Deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 31. The following points have been specifically referred to in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee :— (a) On the Arabian coast Koweit and the so-called Trucial Chiefs are continually threatened by Ibn Saud. Is the maintenance of their independence necessary for British purposes, and, if so, how is it to be secured? (P.G. 3 Yin.) .(b) Policy of His Majesty’s Government vis-d-vis Ibn Saud, with particular reference to . . . Trucial Chiefs and air route. (P.G. 6, 2 (c), 1.) (c) Policy of His Majesty’s Government towards the Trucial Chiefs (compare Colonel Haworth’s proposal for a greater degree of inlerference and support, with a view to securing that they shall not be absorbed by Ibn Saud). (P.G. 6, 2 (c) 2.) {d) Steps necessary on the north Arabian coast in connection with slavery (and arms traffic). (P.G. (3, 2 (c), 3.)
