Their headquarters were originally at Shanghai before they moved to Sianfu. The Chinese authorities are making difficulties regarding the wireless transmitter installed at Ansifu, because their permission was not sought for its installation. Mr.Fleming received on 27th September an invitation from Lufthansa to lead an expedition to Sinkiang to find the lost airmen.

Before going to Berlin, Fleming consulted me regarding the line he might take. I explained to him confidentially our attitude towards German aviation in Central Asia and asked him to find out what he could eBout Lufthansa's plans for their search for the lost aeroplane. 2. I am sending copies of this note to the Air Ministry, the Kabul Legation and the Government of India. i V L.Collier,Esq. ,C.M.G. , Foreign Office.f 2 ?, P.2.6335/37. Mr.Pete 2 ' Fleming was asked by Lufthansa to go to Berlin on 22nd September in order that they might consult him regarding the organisation of the search for the Lufthansa aeroplane lost in Central Asia. Mr.Fleming flew to Berlin and returned on 23rd September. He has given me the following account of his conversation with the Germans. He found them in what he describes as a rather romantic frame of mind, ignorant of the conditions of the problem and without much sense of realities. The German authorities in Berlin are rather vague as to the route wnich the German aeroplane followed. They believe that on the outward journey, after leaving the 7/akhan, if flew via fashkurghan to the neighbourhood of Karghalik, then followed the Karghalik-Khotan-Cherchen route. They suspect, however, that on the return journey it may have been intended to follow a direct line from Cherohen to the Wakhan. It is evident that the Lufthansa authorities in Berlin are not fully acquainted with the details of Von Gabions's plans. Mr.Fleming discovered that the Eurasia Company were having trouble in China, possibly for political reasons. They have moved their headquarters to Sianfu and think it may be necessary to transfer them again to Yunnanfu. They are also having trouble with the wireless installation which they erected, possibly surreptitiously, at Ansifu. The message which Von Gablenz sent out Ig- hours after leaving Ansifu was the only message which he sent out after leaving that place. At that time he is said to have been about two-thirds of the way to Charklik. The/The Lufthansa Berlin authorities were rather evasive regarding the plans of the aircraft now at Kabul. Mr. Fleming was not able to ascertain whether they have as yet done much searching. There was some talk of landing at There is also an idea of flying the big aeroplane now at Kabul through India to Hanoi and thence to North West China. Mr.Fleming advised the Germans not to pursue their search either by air or by land. He emphasized that a land expedition from whatever direction it entered Sinkiang might meet at any point with the troubles encountered by Herr Filclmer, and in this connection he reminded the Germans that their anti-Comintern Agreement with Japan has not endeared them to any party in Sinkiang. He made two suggestions: (a) that a Swede might be employed surreptitiou to go to Cherchen or Khotan, and (b) that the assistance of the Russian Consular authorities in Sinkiang might bo invoked through the diplomatic channel. But trie main burden of Mr.Fleming T s advice to the Germans was that if Von Gablenz and his companions are dead nothing more can be done, and that if they are alive they will almost certainly, provided that they behave with tact, return, possibly after a lapse of some months, to the ken of civilization.

Draft telegram to the Government of India (repeated to Kabul) givins an indication of how far German requests for facilities should be met. Previous papers :— 4136a 1000 10.35Minute Paper political Department, Early disaster has befallen the German efforts to establish a direct civil air route to the Far East via Afghanistan and Sinkiang. Two experimental flights from Kabul to China were successfully accomplished in August but the first machine to attempt the return flight has come to grief and has not yet been found. The second experimental machine is understood to have met with an accident in China and is being brought back by sea. The first information regarding the lost plane was contained in a message received at the Air Ministry on 8 th September from the British Air Attache, Berlin, which stated that a Lufthansa aircraft undertaking an experimental flight between China and Kabul left An-Si-San (Kansu) on 3Cth August ; that wireless communication was lost l£ hours after leaving An-Si-San; that it had only just been realised that the machine had not reached Kabul; and that an air expedition was being sent from Germany forthwith. The message then went on to give a list of facilities which the German air authorities desired from the Indian Government. This air expedition (consisting qswajuL &amp;L' of two aircraft) MMfc^Kabul on the 11th September and has since been engaged on reconnaissance flights. A third (and a more powerful) machine sent from Germany, after making a forced landing 2CC miles west of Kabul, is understood to have reached Kabul on the 19th September. According to information supplied to the Air Ministry by the Lufthansa Company’s London representative these machines intend to conduct an extensive search for the missing aircraft from the Kabul end, while a similar search of the Eastern end conducted by machines attached to the Sino-German (Eurasia) Service. Apart from the request contained in the first €063 Wt 9696/P 28 5000 4 37 10P message/message a number of requests for facilities (including a request for permission to use Gilgit emergency Inndlrj and the establishment of direct wireless contact between the British Consul-General, Kashgar, and the German party at Kabul) have been received orally by the Air Ministry from the German air authorities and have been communicated by us to the Government of India without a pronounced lead. Requests have also been received by Major Macann, the British Charg^ d’Affpires at Kabul, from the German Minister and the Leader of the search pprty. Hitherto the handling of the matter has been dealt with through the air authorities of the two countries with our Air Attach^ at Berlin as the go-between. The 'Foreign Office consider, however, that it is most desirable that henceforth the matter should be handled through the diplomatic channel, partly because of its intrinsic importance and partly in order to avoid muddle. The best channel would appear to be the German Minister in Kabul and Major Macann, and, with the approval of the Foreign Office, the Air Ministry have now informed the German authorities with whom they are in touch that it may assist matters if negotiations regarding co-operation between trie party at Kabul and the Indian Government are carried on through the German and British Ministers at Kabul. It seems desirable that in transferring discussionfji from London and Berlin to Kabul we should give Major Macann and the Government of India an indication of how far German requests for facilities should be met It is i t--i 1 v that the Germans plan to use the * accident to the Lufthansa machine as an excuse to survey parts of Indian territory, although it is doubtful whether this need cause us any great concern.

Department for at this stage the easier it will be for us to take the line with the Germans and the Afghans^v/hen and Sinkiang is clearly hazardous and that accidents appear to entail flights over Indian territory and the co-operation of the Indian authorities, and that for these reasons we hope that the project for this air route will not be pursued. This might be a useful line for us to be able to take in supplementation of an offer to the Germans of transit facilities in India and Burma. It will be recalled that a decision on this point v/as deferred pending receipt of the views of the Governments of India and Burma, both of whan have now stated that they would have no objection to the grant Major Macann at Kabul on the above lines ( in which the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry concur) is submitted. the search is ovei^ that an air route via the 77akhan of transit facilities/ 4 /v.

We have informed the German authorities with whom we are in touch, that we think it may assist matters if negotiations regarding co-operation between the party at Kabul and the Indiai Government should be carried on through the German and British Ministers at Kabul.

Mr»Wplt on t A nunber of requests for facilities for the Gemon pir expedition 3 which is senrching for the received orally 'by the Air Ministry from the German air authorities and have 'been communicated by us to the Government of India without any pronounced lead. Requests are also being received by Maj or Macann from the German Minister in Kabul and the leader of the search expedition. him on 2Cth September. He considers it most desirable that it should henceforth be handled through the diplomatic channel, partly because of its intrinsic importance and partly because of the flabbiness of the Air Ministry. It is in any case desirable to get the question handled through one channel in order to avoid muddle. We agreed that the best channel would be the German Minister in Kabul and Major Macann. I understand thst Mr.Collier has discussed this point with Squadron Leader Darvall and that the Air Ministry are unlikely to object to this proposal. It seems desirable that in transferring discussions from London and Berlin to Kabul we should give Major Macann and the Government of India an indication of how far German requests for facilities should be met. It is only too likely that the Germans plan to use the accident to the Lufthansa machine as an excuse to survey parts of Indian territory., although I doubt whether this matters very much. On the other hand the more facilities the Germans ask for the easier it will be for us to take the line with the Germans and the Afghans, when the search is over, Lufthansa plane* lost between Kabul and China, have been Mr.Collier asked me to discuss this question with 5853 5000 3/37 that/that an air route via the Wakhan and Sinkiang is clearly hazardous and that accidents appear to entail flights over Indian territory and the co-operation of the Indian authorities, and that for these reasons we hope that the project for this air route will not be pursued.

A number of requests for facilities for this search have been received by the Air Ministry from the German air authorities and passed on by us to the Government of India and to H.M.Minister, Kabul. Various requests have also been received by our Legation at Kabul from the German Minister there and from the leader of the German search party. It seems to us desirable that all requests for assistance by the Government of India should be made through one channel and that this channel should be a diplomatic one. We would therefore be grateful if, provided the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry agree, the Air Ministry could inform the German air authorities^ with whom they are in contact*, that the consideration by the competent Indian and British authorities of their requests for facilities would be rendered easier if they are put forward through a single channel and that this channel could most conveniently be the German Minister at Kabul and the British Minister/Minister at Kabul.

The flight had three crew members: Baron von Gablenz, Flight Captain Untucht, and Herr Kirchoff. The file records requests for assistance from the German authorities, and assistance rendered by the Government of India.Included in the file are two extracts from
                           The Times, from 9 and 27 September 1937 respectively (see folios 22 and 78), reporting on the initial disappearance of the air crew and their return to Kabul on 27 September.The recovery of expenses incurred by the Government of India from the German Government in 1938 is also documented in the file.The main correspondents in the file are as follows: Arthur Ernest Macann, the British Chargé d'affaires at Kabul; officials of the India Office; and officials of the External Affairs Department of the Government of India. The file also contains input from officials of the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
