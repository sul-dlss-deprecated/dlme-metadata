I understood from you that you thought the India Office would probably agree with such a suggestion, if we made it. I now enclose copies of our letter to Humphrys and his reply, from which you will see that, while agreeing that, in principle, such visits should be discouraged, he thinics unfortunately that it may be difficult for him to put Feisal off a visit to Koweit, and assumes that the Political Resident will try to prevent the Jheilch of Koweit encouraging such a visit. Will you let us know what the India office think on the subject and what instructions they would propose to send to Fowls, in order that we may write to Humphrys? I write semi-officialiy as I understand from Johnstone that this will suit you best at your end. Yours ever, (3d.) CHRISXOPHiR WARNER. COPY SENT TO.&lt;nfr nno vomziw OFFICE, 3.W. 1. IS (£ 6535/6054/91)• dear Humphry e, I see that Fowls sent*you oirect a copy ol his ( y 29th December 1932. O-- aespatcii to Inula No.792-3 o£ the 19th October, about King Faisal*s recent enquiries on the subject ol possible visits by him to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. Fowls proposes to treat each case on its merits, when it arises; am the Government of India have expressed agreement. But we here are disposed to think that any visit by King Peisal to one of these otates woulu be in India principle undesirable. Ihe/Offlce, we understand semi officially, are Inclined to agree. There seem to us to be various indications that King Feisal wishes to try to bring Koweit gradually into closer connexion with Iraq, and that he would favour anything which would tend tow&amp;ra an agglomeration of Arab States under his own aegis. As regards Kcweit, it has been la la aown by the C.I.D. as recently as 1929 that 'as regards Koweit, it Is better on the whole that-—while endeavouring to secure so far as possible that Koweit shall not be identified with Iraq, we should aefer the establishment of a formal protectorate until circumstances appear to make this more clearly uesirable.' You will see then that our view is entirely against any closer connexion between Iraq and Koweit. As regards the truclal sheikhdoms, a visit by King Feisal woulu, it seems to us, be highly embarrassing in view of the traditional policy of allowing them no direct contact with foreign Powers. We/ His Excellency Sir Francis Humphrya, GGMJ., GCVC., KBE., CIS., etc., etc.We feel, therefore, that it woula he well to lay aown definitely that any desire of King Feisal to visit Ufc Arab States of the Suii should he firmly aiscourugea. It would, of course, he for consideration, if the case arises, whether such discouragement could he administered without risking a disproportionately serious political reaction, hut it might very well he desirable for the Resident or yourself to have a definite ruling to go on that in principle tt.k. Government are against such visits, as inmediats action would probably he required. I should therefore he grateful to know your views on this matter before discussing it further with the India Office. fours, etc. (3d.) GKOiSK RONDEL./\ QnuX • Brltlsb Embassy, (E 461/461/91) Bagdad. (72/3/33) 11th January 1933. My dear Renael, j '' Please refer to your letter E 6535/6054/91 of the December on the subject of possible visits by King Paiaal to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf* I agree that, in principle, such visits should be firmly discouraged unless there is some vary special reason for muring exception. In the case of the Irucial shaikhdoms, it should not be difficult for me to dissuade King Faisal from carrying out any intention he migjit have of paying them a visit. The case of Kuwait seems to me to be on a different footing ana, though I am personally against the establishment of tiny closer connection between Kuwait and •Iraq than exists at present, it will obviously be much more difficult to convince King Faisal of the justice of our claim that Ku^it is out of bounds for him. You will remember that the Shaikh of Kuwait paid King Faisal a visit in Bagdad last summer, while I was absent in Europe, and it might be claimed by Faisal that it would be discourteous on his part not to return the visit. Then there is the interminable question of the date gardens, and the prevention of smuggling from Kuwait into ’Iraq which has lately assumed rattier serious proportions. The Director of Customs recently told me that he estimated that more thar £60,000 worth of goods had been smuggled into ’Iraq from Kuwait during the past year, and that a member of his staff had been shot dead in an affray with Kuwaiti smugglers. G.W. HEN DEL 9 E3q., C.M.G. ivIt ie true that both these matters are not proper subjects for King Faisal to tackle personally, but it might not be easy to put him o£f a visit to Kuwait for • the ostensible purpose of arranging a settlement of such outstanding questions* though the real object of the visit would undoubtedly be political, while* therefore* I should like to be instructed to use my influence to prevert the King paying a return visit to Kuwait* I assume that every endeavour will behade at the other ena to prevent the Jhaikh himself encouraging the Idea should the question arise.

We entirely share the views of the Foreign Office and agree that it is desirable in principle that such visits should be discouraged. In the case of Kuwait the position, as Humphrys points out, is less easy than in other cases, for His Majesty would probably in practice have little difficulty in finding a pretext for a visit. In all the circumstances, the best course seems to be that the Resident and the political Agent, Kuwait, should, as Humphrys suggests, do what they can to prevent the Shaikh himself encouraging the idea should the question arise.

D.O.Letter to J.G.Laithwaite, Esquire, India Office, London, ao.D-12?7-V33, dated the 13th April, 1933. Foreign and Political Department, New Delhi, The 13th April 1933.D.0.NO.D-1277-N/33. NEW DELHI, The 13th April, 1933* 22 Dear Laithwaite, Please refer to Fowle*s demi-official letter No. 228-3 of 1933, dated the 17th March 1933, on the subject of possible visits by King Feisal to the AraO states of the Persian Gulf, copy of which was sent to you direct. We agree generally with Fowls’s views. Since he thinks that it will be far from easy for him to discourage the Shaikh of Kuwait, should King Feisal at any time make a definite proposal to him for a visit, we consider that the suggestion made in paragraph 5 of his letter would prove a good solution of this rather awkward situation. In our opinion a private visit arranged through us need have no important political reactions, whereas a refusal to permit the visit whether conveyed formally through His Majesuy s Ambassador or through the Sheikh informally would give the whole affair quite unnecessary prominence. We therefore recommend that if the Secretary of State sees no objection Fowle be authorised to take action as suggested by him in paragraph 5 of his letter. 3. Copies of this letter are being sent to oir Francis Humphrys and to Fowle. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) W.K.Fraser-Tytier. J. G.
