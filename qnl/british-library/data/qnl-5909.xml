HICKINBQTHAM.ESQ Bagdad* 14th December, 1942 COPY. My dear Harold, On receiving your letter (E 6723/251-5/93) of 21st November, I asked Holt to see Nasrat al Farisi and to enquire how the Faddaghiyah case now stands* of the hearing of the appeal had been due in the main to technical difjiculties about his power of ottoxney and otner documents and to the occasional illnesses of the lawyers on one side or the other. He thought however that a judgment would be given at the hearing now fixed for December 31st. In his opinion the many on the contrary while there wes life there was hope* He warned |_ . Holt that though there was no doubt that the Shaikh had paid for the Faddaghiyah estate the purchase had, from the legal point of view, been made in an irregular and in some ways an illegal manner. made it clear to the Shaikh's lawyer who had briefed him that the chances of success were not good. 3* Holt asked him what could be done if the Court of Appeal (Istinaf) decided in favour of the appellants and against the Shaikh* Nasrrt al Farisi said that in the event it would be open to the Sheikh to take the care to the Court of Cassation (Tamiz). This court could only consider points of law but as nearly the whole of the pleading on each side had concerned points of law this limitation would not be important. lie explained however that he could not himself on his existing instructions take the case to Cassation as he had been briefed only for the present appeal. Further action would therefore rest with the Sha'kh and his lawyer Sulaiman Faidhi. 4. Holt then enquired whether, in the event of the judgment in both the Court of Appeal ^nd Cassation going against the Shaikh, His Highness would be able to claim the refund of the purchase money. Nasrat al Farisi repli^ d that the Shaikh should certainly do so and added that as it seemed that the purchase money had been paid in Turkish gold liras the Shaikh would do very well if he got back the price originally paid for the property. -He said that in his opinion a claim for the refund of the purchase price should be made in the Basra Court at once if a final judgment were given -against the Shaikh in the Court of Cassation. Ho could not of course do this himself but it should be done by Sulainan Faidhi, the Shaikh's lawyer at Basra. , Holt^askod him, in conclusion, whether in the event of a final judgment being given against the Shaikh and of a claim then being^lodged for the return of the purchase price, the Shaikh would be able to remain in possession until the sum in question had been refunded to him. Nasrat al Farisi was a little doubtful about this. He said that much would depend on the Basra Courts and the manner in which the&gt; were approached by the Shaikh's lawyer there. He thought that it might be possible to devise a gambit whereby the Shaikh could be kept in possession of Faddaghiyah until the money paid for it was paid back to him but it was, in his view, by no means certain that the rival claimants would not secure a judgment awarding them the right of immediate occupation if they won their present appeal against the award of the Land Settlement Commission. postponements had not been prejudicial to the Shaikh's interests, J He would do his best to win the case but he had from the beginning 5. H. A. CACCIA, ESQ5 . You may rely on our doing all we can to help but the case is exceedingly complex and the Shaikh*s-legal position unhappily weak. This being so we are all very much in the hands of the lawyers. Nasrat al Farisi is, I am assured by those who should know, as good a man as could be found both from the point of view of skill and integrity and it would be foolish for us to try to plot a course for him through waters which he knows infinitely better than we do. As for gingering him up Holt, v/ho knows him well, feels sure that Nasrat would probably throw up the case in a huff at the first sign that we were dissatisfied with his conduct of it. 6. Holt says that he gave Nasrat openings to complain about the Judge if he had wished to do so, but no complaint was^ made and I have not heard of any intrigue against the Shaikh*s interests except that of the rival claimants, which of course lies behind the whole case; but that is not a Government but a family affair. 7 # The case of the Shaikh*s title to the land reclaimed on the river front of his Fao property is still in the hands of the Land Settlement Committee at Basra before which the Shaikh is presumably represented by his Basra lawyer and so far Nasrat al Farisi has had nothing to do with it. have sent .you copies of the further correspondence which has passed between the Persian Gulf Residency and ourselves on this subject. 8. The destruction in May 194-1 of the bulk of the Embassy’s archives is often a handicap in dealing with the complexities of the Shaikh of Koweit’s properties in Iraq. For example, I am told that in 1938 when the new Land Settlement Law was enacted a commentary on its provisions based on expert opinion was sent from the Embassy to the Foreign Office. There is now no copy of it in our archives but from our index it seems that it .was probably contained in a letter from Morgan (then in charge here) to Baggallay No. 776/3/38 of March 9th, 1933. I should be grateful, if you could trace this and send us a copy. So many varied points arise about the application of this law to the Shaikh’s properties end it would be useful to have this paper for reference. 9. I am sending copies of this letter, with which the Ambassador agrees, to Prior and Hickinbotham. Yours ever, (Scjd.) G. H.

Faddaghiyah case postponed until 18th January at request of opponents lawyers. 3. ^shiyah case postponed on some excuse made 'by ohaiich*s lawyer as he has no hope of succeeding in this case. Please see paragraph 3 of my letter 0/5*5 dated October 4th, 1941 and my telegram 0/8 January 3rd, 1942.(IV The Faddaghya Fstate was originally the property of a asha Az-Zuhair, who had appointed her husband Anmad Pasha Az-Zuhair, as her deputy. Ahmad Pasha had ap^.ointed Abdul ,/ahab Pasha al-Kertas and authorized him to sell the aforementioned property to children of Shaikh lubarrak as-Subah, according; to the later's wish, for a certain amount of money. Abdul iahab al Kertas was quite prepared to have the said property ^e w istored in Tapo in the names of the persons appointed by Shaikh Mubarrak, but as the rules of the Tapo do not allow the registration of property at Basrah in the name of any foreigner, and as the buyers were not registered as Ottomans and refused, bo do so, the Ottoman Crovernment refused to have ther said property registered in Tapo in the name of the said persons. Shaikh hubarrak and Abdul Jahat al Kertas, the deputy of awasha, reached a written agreement, according to which the property was sold by the Deputy to Shaikh Ilubarrak and he, the Deputy, received the value in full and they both were present in the office of the British Consul, in Basrah and had the agreement attested by him. The buyers then received the property from the Deputy of the owner of the property and /as at their disposal since tnen i.e. since the agreement has oeen attested and from that date upto the present day they had a free hand in the property. Awasha az-Zuhair was still alive and remained alive till November, 1931, /hen she died in Istonbul. She never claimed against this property at all during her life until her death. In 1915, Shaikh M barrak as-Subah, communicated with Sir Henry Dobbs, Financial Adviser and showed him the agreement which states the purchase of the property and which was attested by the British Consul and he requested that the property may be registered in Tapo in his children's’ names, as there /ere no more obstacles which ’/ere e isting during the Ottaman rule, i.e, to become Ottoman subjects. The Financial Adviser, issued a written order to the Tapo office, instructing them to register the sale in the names of the buyers, according to abovementioned agreement and that the value has already been paid in full to the seller and so the property was registered^in the name of the children of Shaikh Mubarrak as-Subah in the year 1915 . After the death of Awasha az-Zuhair which took place in 1915, she was inherited by her two daughters, Najiba and A'eida and her nephew Abdulla az-Zuhair. This Abdulla az-Zuhair, appointed a lawyer, Salm .n Ash-Sho/af, /ho filed a suit, besides Awasha's Legacy, and asked that the documents of registration of the property in Tapo (which took place according to the instructions oi the Financial Adviser; should be cancelled and the property should be hancied over to the heirs of Awasha, as the document of sale was written outside of Tapo and it is therefore not to be taken into account at all. The case was seen by the Court of Justice of the first Instance, and the judgement /as pronounced by the said Court, according to which, the documents issued by Tapo, were cancelled and that the property had to be handed over to^the heirs. The Lawyer of As-Subah's family put an appeal requesting the cancellation of the judgement. According to the Lew, no aortal will be considered unless a full security, guaranting the ctarnage&lt;§&gt; ZCrl '*Xl~ or loss which the opponent -nay sustain, is offered, to the Cou^t, in case ,,he appellor is found to he on the .iron - side and has no right to a^eal, 1 * waj t to apjeal, and as the security offered by ixs-Subah’ not sufficient his appeal was rejected without consid- Lawyer even the -round of the cas e • There is :ood ‘or the one reap x ;ea. rt the , _ . — reason, m the Iraqi Law, 'hose apcea,. is rejected by the Court.

In 1915, Shaikh M.barrak as-Subah, communicated .with Sir Henry Dobbs, Financial Adviser and shored him the agreement which states the purchase of the property and which was attested by the British Consul and he requested that the property nay be registered if 1 .Tapo in his children’s names, as there were no more obstacles which were e&gt;isting during the Ottaman rule, i.e. to become Ottaman subjects, ihe Financial Adviser, issued a written order to the iapo office, instructing them to register the sale in the names of ‘'he buyers, according to aboyementioned agreement and that the value has already been paid in full to the seller and so the property was registered in the name of the children of Shaikh Mubarrak as-Bubah in the ye^r 1915 . Alter the death of Awasha az-Zuhair which took place in 1915. she was inherited by her two daughters, Naiiba and ii’eida and her nephew Abdulla az-Zuhair. This Abdulla az-Zuhair, appointed a lawyer, Salman iish-Sho/af, /ho filed a suit, besides Awasha*s he. acy and asKed that the documents of registration of the property in lapo (which took place according to the instructions of the' Financial adviser) should be cancelled and the property should be hanosc* ov r to the heirs of Awasha. as the document of sale was .written outside of Tapo and it is therefore not to be taken into account at all. The casepwas seen by the Court of Justice of the first Instance, and the judgement ;as pronounced by the said Court, according to which, the documents issued by Tapo, we 'e cancelled and that the property had to be handed over to x the heirs. ^ihe Lawyer oi As-Subah’s family put an appeal requesting £he cancellation of the judgement, according to the Law, no appeal will be considered unless a full security, guaranting the da-uge or/or loss which the ojjponent may sustain, is offered to the Court, in case the appellor is found to be on the ^ron^ side and has no right to appeal, and as the security offered by As-Suba^s Lawyer was not suiricient his appeal was rejected witnout considering even the ground of the case. There is a good reason, in the Iraqi Law, for the one whose appeal is rejected by the Court. He has the right to reappeal and ask that his appeal may be seen by Tamyi z Court. Depending on this privellage, As-Subah’s Lawyer appealed to the Tamyiz Court asking the Court to reverse the aforementioned judgement. But before seeing the case by the Tamyiz Court, the settlement in the area whepe tne property under consideration is, was announced and as the Law of the settlement does not allow the Courts of Justice to see any case regaring any property, which is inside the boundaries of the settlement area, the Tamyiz Court did not see the previous judgement but referred the matter to the Settlement Committee to see it. Then the Settlement Committee saw the case and passed the judgement proving the document issued by the Tapo according to the instructions of the Financial Adviser, to be right and lawful, considering the property to be legal property of iis-eubah s family owing to tne free hand they had upto that date, bo the Committee passed the judgement and published it in the Grovernment Gazette. _ , . # The Lawyers of both Abdullah Az-Zuhair's and Naiiba Az- Zuhair s heirs, appealed against this judgement, to the Court of appeal of the Lana aetklement. As-bubah fajoily a^so have appointed HisAxce^pency Nasrat al Faresi, as their Lawyer, to plead lor their rights in this case. The case is still under consideration in the Cqurt of Appeal of the Land Settlement and the Court has not considered the main points of the case, yet. *4% UJr M f No. 15 No. 11 H.TT's Consul-General, Basra, political igent, Kuwait.

I am awaiting your orders As to the permit,the British Consulate asked me by the telephone to go to their office,and when I ^nt there,I explained everything to them, and told them how the permit was delayed. The Interpreter telephoned the accountant of the Commitee asking him the reason of delaying the permit. The accountant statted with many exceuses s-.ying that he Commitee had received a letter from the Ministry of Economy telling them not to give the permit to export any dates outside of Iraq.. The interpreter told him. that a telegram has been received from the British Embassy Baghdad enqui ring about the permit and why was it delayed,then he asked him what reply should we send to the Embassy, accountant replied that he was going to fP' dates see the Mutassarrif,being Acting Director of the/Commitee,and that he would a let him. know later. In fact the Accountant sent for me on the the next lay and told me that the permit was reaiy andyhe ao^ed me to send the necessaiy stamps so that he may send^in to be signed by the Mutassarrif,which in fact I did and he told me later that he will send it to the Mutassarrif to sign it,and that was on Thursday. I,then went to^Cosulate and informed the interpreter and he telepho .ed to t’ne accountant,who gave his word that he had sent the permit to the Muiassarrif for signature and that it will be ready in a short time.. I have as.^ed the accountant again and he apolo gized saying that he was very sorry because the permit was not signed yet as the Mutassarrif was very busy,but it will te ready on Saturday,so I informed the Consulate of the result. As to the Eaddaghya Case,I have been informed by Haj Suleiman Faizi that Suleiman ash-Shawaf,the Lawyer of the opponant did not attend the Court in Baghdad on 18-1-43,because he was bus' with some other cases here,and so he has sent a telegram t: the Court of Appeal in which he apologized for being absent.

My dear Colleague, ^ I hope that you have rec^i^ed ^y reply-paid telegram and you have understood that the time for seeing the two cases of Faddaghya and Bashya, is the 26th inst. I taice this opportunity to let you K.now aoout what has already happe ned about these two cases. 1. Please find herewith a fcopy of_fulI pleading placed by me before the court regarding my points of view about al-Faddaghya case and the opponent has been summoned*. I intend that a decision in regard of this case will be rea ched on the next meeting of the court,unless anything would cause the case to be postponed,owing to some claims which possibly may be brought by the opponents.*I still have a firm hope that the decision will be in our favour owing to what I can make out from the clear rules and laws concerned and as I have already explained in my pleading. I shall be very grateful to have any remark from you,which you consider worth adding to the arguments. Let me have your reply before the 'lorementioned date. 2. As to -il-Bashya case, the pleading has been ended and my reply to the three points mentioned by the reply of the opponent,,of which I am enclosing a copy and which are summarised as follows:- (a) The decision of the Settlement as indicated by Article 20,of the Law of the Land Settlement,is a forcible decision,as all'cases are to be examined even the appeal regarding those cases have not been received. Thus the appeal placed by my prodecessur,whether it was called a protest of others,or by any other name, such an appeal is allowed by the law to oe accepted,as it is related to a case placed before the Settlement Commitee. Likewise the reques . for an appeal, whether that appeal is named the opposed appeal or not,such request should be accepted for the same reason. The reason for delaying it,is according to the excuse mentioned by my predecessor in his application. (b) My clients have had a free hand in the shares whicu were s placed under appeal since 19b9,until the order of execution was carried out and the opponents did not dispose with the shares during that period. Thus the free hand which my clients had,calls for considering their full rights in the shares according to Article 10 of the Law of Settlement,and in the meantime,the opponents having lost the right of having the free hand during the same period,this fact proves that they have no right any more according to Article 6 of the same Law. This is a brief summary my essential replies and I am very sorry to say that I could not get any other points. But the result &lt;*hich is expected by me,is negative one,owing to the poor foundation of the case and the long time which has alredy passed on the appeal. • i I shall send you a wire when I get the result of the next session.

Their disposal is moreover proved by documents of Topo proving their owner ship of the said land. The decision reached by the Settlement Committee, of havin* the lands reristered in their names, is quite pj^ect, and according to the i^aw, especially according to the law of settlement, which is to be carried out in this respect. As to the claims placed by the appellant, .-just to have them as the foundation for the appeal, in order to cancel the above mentioned decision. Such claims sheu'd not be considered. The laws on which the President of the Committee has depended, when he reached his final decision are far beyond from beinm proved, and they prove th°t this decision is quite leral and there is no lemal way to cancel it. £ut even then ib is quite good bo revian the law of Settlement, in view of its relation to tlis case and the result of which will show and prove that such a decision was necessarily to be reached according to the Law of Settlement. As you are well awax^e that the Law of Settlement was especially inade for the settlement of all misunderstand ing and quarrels regarding the ownership of the lands, and that his first and important aiw would be to ensure- 2 - tV,e rirhts of having a free lianfi and to decide it when ,v e , i s rie has been under the free hand for the leral nerio« of time. This fact of havinr a free hand for the legal period of tine, have been considered Toy the law of Settlement, to he preferred to anjr other claim j’f.nar^inm the ov^nership Oi the lan* an* it3 tfeing re ^isTere^ in ihe nawe Cx any p6 rson. ^ The Ailya J-'a^azine has nounl'« tie iiF© as oein* unworthy to create the rirht en*i l^as counter it as &amp; ifean for defence an&lt;? not Tar appeal, hut the Law of Settierent have counted, H -he fact of having 3 free r.ani for a certain period oT time, as a cause of drorming the hhe ri.^6 of 'that who never had a free hand an-d to #ide the rights to that who nad the iiee hand,and has considered jt as a cauae for ciaiminr and anneal in*, ana this o p n he nro^ed by aany points of the sare lav/., for ^ exapnle, it is mentioned in pararr&amp;ph ^ of Artitile G Ox the above mentioned law, that Taco documents ^should he ne^lected, in case it has been proved that the possessors such documents have nerlected t'neir lands and has ne/^r disposed wit&gt;^ them for a certain period of +ime. it is quite clear now that the loss of a 'ree hand, is considered by the said law as a ^act of depolishin^ the rirhts. On the contrary, pramraobs t and A 01 Article TO 01 the So;| 6^ law *ine that the Avwv v ria land, of which a eei tain pei'son has been j*iven a fjee hand, such land should he. tp wintered vi'ia authorized land, j oi a cei tain tc r io« o r tire. This proves that the action of having a free hand for a certain wriod of tine, is counted as the cause of creatin* the rights, in view of thie ai cn eipent ioxie* j.ciw. That is why I -said and I air say in* ''iBi as n^y A client in fact had a free hand ( fchich the onnonent could not deny) in ihe lands under consideration, for a period which is dou v le to what is considered by all the laws and rules and so the Land Settlement Corrittee have- 3 - C ieeMr# to register such “Dieoes of lania- ir t&gt;'e nam of clients aocor^inr to the Law of Settlement. 2.- The f olio win r are my rmlies to the explanations of lenuty of the annellante in his ann li cat ion end which he intended to have as the cause of havinr the decision of the committee beinr cancelled: (a) Tne lawyer of the appellant stated in brief tho+ t^e 1 Gt v oo^p&lt;itt*“ rirht to s^e this and to l^ciie, «s ^e coF.ri+t.p- had to ^e^iste^ ’-he property ir +^0 name o'* t v e ’'-erhers as-^ubah, while in Ms opinion, it was authorized according to the Tf Alan TT issued, to consider the nronerty of ^haihh ^ubarah as Q ubah. ? ,T y renly to +v ir ’was as follows:-- Article T ^o.1 of the law of Settlement is quite clear and that the Alan of Settlement and finally, to authorize to see and decide the settlement, all these are carried.out accord inr to the rMe of -nointin^ out the lands which are intended to he settled and not to point out the owners such lands. Sometimes same lands are mentioned in the name of certain person in the Alan” as it is the case ’Wi fcr toe Alan of these lands, and the reason is that some property is well known by the name of certain person the fame A is legally consi'-^red as a name. In fact, the property oelonrinm to the ^haikh oi Kuwait-^s family is well known in Basrah as the property of Shaikh of Kuwait ami so it was mentioned in the Alan settlement issued oy the Kiris ^er oj justice and which was published in Me copy of Al„ w akoea al Iraya T s newspaper J«o.l8l7 f^ated 22-7-40 i.e (to ^oint out the rooerty beon^inic to Shaikh of Kuwait and Shaikh 1 of Fohammara, which is in the Places mentioned elow and below that it the name of FuddoMya was mentioned in the list of Place and that was quite clear.) From this you can maKe out chat the said Alan was not meant speaially foi a certain shaikh whose name was clearly M/en, and ifc was nob meant the definition intended by the deputy of the appellants but it meant to include the pieces of land under consideration, aid that is proved by the fact of havinr the name of Fed darhya clearly included. It is therefore oui+e clear that the lawyer of the appellants is try in m to sticky wheat is impossible to be Maimed and thus he said f10i;h corF-ittfec o* XftriA oe’t’tlftiwii'b was not authorize*. uO see the cases concerninr the saii nieces o± &gt; n*. kte sai* thiat his (b) The lawyer of the appellant clients depend on the notice, on having the stare of decision and iJsued by the Court of Jirst Instant of fasrah i’ 0 .373/932 date* 5-6-''93S. My reply to this claiir* wasi 1.- The Law of Settlement has recornised the rirht of' bavin* a Tree hand, to ie the basis on which they refer when they decide the ownership of a Ja nd and to register it in the nai«e of a person. '^e cannot find in any Article of this law, that the judre^ent tbs^-c* by any court is ever nenbione* or ever considered. It is -therefore quite evident 'iha- ; ihi claiming rh^t the .iudgewent of the courts hinder or stop the Settlement Comritte^ and their courts 'rom reaching the decision of a free hard, after having the fact be in* proved; such a claiss is only a guess which cannot be % proved by the iaw of Settlei^ent. If they say that the woar* (Locuwonts) which Is mentioned in Paragraph L-2and3 of Article 7 and paragraph L of Article 9 and paragraph L-2 anil paragraph C-2 at Article 10, of the Law of Set+lement. is mentioned in an unlimited way, so it can be made to include the judgements passed by the courts. fabing this into consideration also, it is impossible to consider the rjudg^emcnts passed by the courts except as a document of many documents which are placed before the Committee t'e land Settlement, and which are meant to be as means of proving gemething and are depended on similarly tc any other other/ document of the sawe type that is to say, if the document does not clash with any other documents it is quite satisfactory and has been proved by a free hand, such documents will have its effects.

The -’eoisi-n reached by the Settlement Committee contained the following:- Low to reeister them in iapo and to be satisfied that the registration rs correct an. the free hand of a/. Cuban in the oroTjerty since they -urctiased^on 1 qOQ and having registered it on I 9 I 5 '. It i S therefore 1 uit * useless for the lawyer of the apoeHants to say anything in this conpectlon. 1 have aJso Kotice* bhab the lawyer of the appellants 0 iseussei the question of sellinr the untransferred property, which in tales place outside of Taro, are not to be considered. Such sales which tale rlace outside or Tape have nothing to do with the property which caused the aopeal, as the reesister showing the ownership of my olier i.s is still in the Taro Office. But I preferred not to leave this olaim without reputation. Thus I say that the law of Settlement have considered such sales and I can rrove chat by Pa agrarh 3,2 of Article 7 o' +he same law which reads as follows:- All lands owned6^ -Hr i o •nerson to })• re^i^tcrec In ‘hifi rajne 'provifte# thi t he can Drove '''is ov/nc-r.^hir h t y Dro^ucinf’ le^al eocufcierits which aie sufficient to Drove he owne® the nroDertj *ror a nersor ir who c e rat-e tne ■prooe rtv was r^^isteiofi in the registers of T^oo.

The lawyer of the appellant clawie# th a t Anasheez az-Zubair was in Istana (Constantinople) up to 1 933 an# his intention is to create sowe sort of a block in the continuation of tire. But in the save hii’e lie says that the decree of the court of Bisst Instance No. 373 / 932 , vras confesses tv.e existance of the process o r tiie. But as to the clai* that Awasha was ih Istana, this is sirpiy a claim, are uoes not effect the fact ohat ry client ha# a ?±ee hand. Ihe only excuse mentioned by the decrees of this law is not to co^arei with the excuse decidfe# by the ia^azine. It is rore quite clear by Article 6 of the said law. that a free hand can be practiced either direct or tbrourhL sore one and if the free ham is neglected then the document should be neglected too. Thus even if we adrit that Awasha was in Istana, even then she could have ha^i a free hand throurph her Aren; who was in Basrah, but she@) . 11 - l&lt;new tmt she hai no free han«l, otherwise she couli have hail a *»ire^t fxee han« iui'inr the -oerioi which 'ocean on J IQ 2 C, wiien, accor^inr to the claim of the lawyer of the appellants, that there was no leral objection for her cowine back to cry. This face closes the *ioor in face of the claims of the aoneilantsI ii { !S» 5. The lawyer of the appellants gueses that the free hand corapared with the documents of Tapo,the former becai-e worthless, but he has for gotten to mention the fact that the last documents of Tapo proves the ownership of my clients of these lands. It is therefore that my clients should be considered as the plaintiff against the document of Tapo. 6 . The decrees of the j-aw of Settlemnet the fact of having a free hand for a certain period of time ,as the cause of rights and as a proof of authorizing,so it is not neceosary in the Settlement to follow what has been reached by some courts to the effect that the process of time is not considered, compared *&lt;iih the documents of Tapo. The Lawyer of the appellants was compelled to confess that his clients did not have a free hand all this long time and that he has noticed the impossibility of their claim,and so started sruggling hard and discussing Para G of Article 6 of thr-. Law of Settlement, which reads as follows:- no t 'All the lands whose documents h^ve been ne.^ledted because of/having a free hand,such lands are considered as pure Amyria Lands'.' It is quite clear that the lawyer of the •appellant did not recognize that when there is a legal cause for the registeration of the property in the name of the Treasury,the party which will have the qualifications of being the opponents of the clients,is the Treasury and not his clients. Article 6 of the Lav of Settlement states that the man who neglects his rights of having a free hand,such person loses his rights and the land should be considered as an Amyria Land,but according to Para B- 3 &amp; 4 of Article 10, declares that the man who has a free hand in an Amyria Land,such land should be registered in his name as an authorized Land. F. — Para C. 3 of Article Id of the Law of Settlement states that tue lands mentioned in the previ^’^ Article should be registered in the name of an Iraqi and who fulfils the coditions mentioned in the above mentioned Para B. 3 $ 4. But there is an annaxation to this para which reads as follows:-' The specifications mentioned in the previous para, does not include the foriegners to whom the lovt. has guaranteed the ri^its of authorization inside Basra Liwa.' My clients are of the foriegners to whom the Iraq lovt. has given a guarantee of the rights of autho rization according to this annexation. G. -- -»-b to the decision of the Commitee regarding the renewal of the registeration in the name of my clients, I do not find it necessary to speak/ i/J ' &gt; '' speak or iiscuss this question,because the free han:i which ray clients hove had all this lon^ period and their cultivating the lands etc.,all these make it necessary that these lands should be registered in the name of ray clients according to the re'adin. of the Law. H.-- Ab to what the Lawyer of the appellant has mentioned of the contents of the decision of the Settlement Commitee that the decree has not been . carried out,this claim I need not refute,because the decree whether it has been executed or not,it does not effect tne lecision reached by the Law of Settlement regarding the free hand of ray clients which they had in a continuous manner since 3b years and that the lands should there fore be registered in their names. X.-- The lawyer of the appellant thinks that the words of Para B.4 of Article 10 of the Law of Settlement which was applied by the Coraraitee, this cannot be applied to this case,because it concerns the lands which are not planted,but not the gardens. I consider this Para to be more prevalent than the previous one,which deals with ^ardens. Whether this or that oara is correct in view of applying, the free hand which ray clients have had, this fact decides that the property should be regis tered in their names owing to the wording of the two paras. J.-- His Excellency the President of the Settlement Coraraitee was himself the President of the Court which passed the 1st. Instance decree,which has been discussed previously,and this fact does not in any way prevent him from exercising his power of Settlement in this case and to pro nounce the judgement after being quite satisfied that it was in agree ment with the Law. Because if the Court of Appeal would have annuled the decree of the 1st. Instance and have sent it bacK to the Court of 1st. Instance,of which he was the President,there would be no reason or cause which would prevent him from seeing the case and pronouncing a judgement in contrary,after being quite satisfied of its being in agree ment with the Law. s 3. Finally:- (a) It is quite evident that my clients have had the said prperty and have had a free hand since thirty five years,and the appellants had never h^d a free hand during the same period. It is therefore quite clear that even we were to say that ray clients had no right of havinga free hand.but Para D of Art^-i.e « of the Law of Settlement decides that the claim of the plaintiff in regard of the said property , shoul 1 be re-' j ec ted while • tv rticle 10of the same Law decides that it is necessary that the property shohld be registered in their names* (b) But my clients’ free hand is proved by a legal document, i.e.the do cument of Tapo which proves their ownership of these pieces of land and this also decides that they,should be registered in their names according to para C.l of Article 10 of the said Law. (c) The document of Tapo which contain the ownership of my clients of the said property are supported by means and valuable documents accor ding to the o^id Law. (d) The rules which are to be excuted in the Sttlement Cases are the laws of Settlement and the reading of this law decides the rights of hauing s free hand,in respect of my clients and it recognize the Register Book of Tapo referring to them. Thus it should not consider any other decree. I vish to mention for the next time that the Law of Settlement ' depended in the first place on the investigation of the points and facts, and to act according to them and thus the law has appointed seperate Courts for them and has prevented the general Courts from seeing any case which is to be seen by the Law of Settlement and has decided to enforce their own judgement without referring to anyother of the General Laws. It is quite evident that acco^ipg to these Lavs, this property should be registered in the name of my clients and to consider^lheir documents of Tapo. The decision of the Land Settlement Commitee to register this prperty in the names of my clients is quite in agreement with the Law and it should not be cancelled in any way. I therefore request that the appealing case be rejected an 1 that the said decision be sanctioned.

A_Repl.yinr j)ir:-The fjr sx appellant; the lawyer Suieis.an Shawaf. had led arainst tiie decision dated 21 - 7-41 which was passed by the President of the Land Settelenent Committee at Far regarding the ownership of the land *©.f 1 which is named al-B&amp;shya, of the area K 0 . 3 , which is nailed al-?add*hya. The said decision was in favour Oj. my clients and their companions, a 3 xhe noints mentioned in his nleading do not bear any legal ui i le-deed (proof) so r ci** going to #ive answers as follows:-- i-.^udir o. rope of Sasrah Lfwa has riven the previous deputy of »‘y clients, Ha.ji Suleiman Faidhi; an explanation showing how the one-sixth belonrinm bo Ah mar Pasha az-Zphair and which he l^as inherited from his motre::: Fatima bint Jasin al-dfushBri, was reri=tered in the names of the sons of Shaikh ^Aibarak as-3ubah in I 9 I 5 . Thus the shares which the first a—eilant cl.iims to be belonging to the one who is under his care and to his client, are connected with this one-sixth which taken out as ar A eritame according to the leral distribution 'rom their lerators Abdulbaki and Hasan the sons of the aforementioned ah kasha. Thus the Tirst appellant has no connection *vtth the shares of iry clients/2 1V ' clierts he is mot to be considered as an ooronent and just to 10 rove that j. an* enclosinr in original the ^ explanation with the ,leral distribution. 2 .- An ^a&amp;hfe az-Zuhairi heirs have Tiled a suit against the heirs 0 ^nharah and have ootained a (decree j .■judfrenent oT the ownership 01 shares, registered in their names in Topo at t}^e present time. This increment has he^n sanctioned bj the court; appeal and has been oar^ird oui by -’.he court o* execution and the shares were left m hheir na^es in Toro before the settlement was declared. Thus the decree pas-ed by the President of the Settlement, re/rardin* the ownership, is nuite in arreement liilh paragraph 1 of Article 7 of the -lgw o' settlersnt, but the appeal of ’he appellants was gainst that Article, ro the appeal of the first appellant is not to he accepted at a] 1 and I ash* th^t f t should Pe re.-jected and tliat he uust pay all charges or the awyer, travel!ir &lt;r ~pp~*-eG and for writing ^he r^-nlyin*- r.- A s to the next His ?x.*asra J - al Faresi, accordinr to the power o^ attorney, bein* the deputy of f-y heirs of Shaikh -uoarak as S-nbahj his a^eal cannot be heard or accepted for the foil owl n*- re n snnsr- (a) He t)1b ced his anneal on 9-2-42, while a double^ r,lire appointed rpr appeal anneniiu^ airainst the decision or the President of the Settlement,^ vSO ii. is liable of be in#' lerjected. (u ) This anpeal cannot be accepted and considered as an,opposite appeal, because the case of appeal of settlement- is a special case and it has not ca^pened accord in # 1 to the rule, so other case is not to oe measured to it and there is opposite appeal in -he cases, o' settlement. In addition to that, my clients were not appellants arainst the second appellant to appeal aoainst them and his anneal is counted as an original anneal which has come after the expiration of +he leyal time. Moreover, i.he decisions of the President of the o r oet'lement, is liable of being appeals arainst, durinr a certain period or time. The second appe!lant has already seen the decision and3 w s f rmc't. cl F'°r to him. ^he tj.mo an^ he had r&gt;o any excuse which had r)re^ented hir from ^'Lacin/r his anneal in the ri*\hit;' time?' 3 ^ he cannot claim that he did no know^** he was absent, as l^nr as his denuly^ Abdul tjali] the lawyer, has comt: to the President of the Committee and the decision was explained to him and thus the appeal of the second appellant is not acoented. • i.- T- r yonr cour ^ does not want to consider the afoi^mentioned facts and insist unon having the criminal facts heinr discussed, *- p to say that my (clients have had their own shares registered in I on o^ the shares w’rich hiey have inhejited from tv.eir legators Arc.nl coki and iiassn.

Thus thejsecond anpellant nas no ri^ht to attack the .iud^ement and his action fs awaira^ the wording of this narayranh of +^e said Article. 5.- The r^al nro+est of the ^pcond A^nellant to ^e President of ihe Commit+ee was o^her’i protest ( ) and was not in agreement wi+h the J-aw for the follcjwn* - reasons :- (a) The other’s protest is placed before the court wha lias passed the decree^ and the Settlement Committee did not pass the judgement of the 1 st instant, out this was passed by the court of 1 st instance o* Lasrah and^ was proved by the Iraqi Court of Anneal, so the protest should not be placed before the Settlement Committee. A prated can be made against a decree .of w&gt;'lch the ^^onent knew nothing and /;as not represented when 'he cess was seen by the the Courts of 1st ins.ance and Court of Aureal. TThile the iu^ement passed in favour of «&lt;y clients arainst th.' second appellant was passed in the presence of t,the heirs of Shaikh Mubarak themselves anrl they have b een sumnoaoi and have shared the fruits. So their -protest cannot be accepted. (c) As the clients with the second aooellant have acted after havinr the property registered in their naves and the .-jud^ei^ent of the first instance Court h»s been carried out and he has accented it, so ±fcx± what the anpeHants have claimed the ownership of the whole land, is a sort of trying to reverse what has , o» been done by them, b-ut such efforts 4 o-nosed and 'heir nrote^t is rejected. ? or these reasons and for those Hflentioned by the previous denuty in his -leadinir which he nlaced Vbef@re the President of the Committee of Settlement, I request you to kindly reject the two anneals and tas to sanction he decree passed by the President of the Se^-tlerert th'f t v *» appellants win have to nay the char-ec o^ tte advocate, travel!inr expenses and the oharres for ^ritinr this pleading. / Advocatedepartment*.

Z I discussed these cases with Holt at the Embassy Baghdad on March 29th and again after seeing Naznat al Farsi, with whom I was very favourably impressed, on the 3 r th March. 3 ^ Nazrat al Farsi informed me that he thought an appeal by the Shaikh's opponents to the Court of Cassation in the Faddaghiya case was unlikely and if made would certainly fail. He advised that the Shaikh should appeal in the Bashiya case to the Court of Cassation and that should the appeal fail a suit for the return of the original purchase money should be filed irrmediately in Basra. He considered there was a very slight chance of a successful appeal but a reasonable chance of the suit for the return of the purchase money succeeding. ( He considered that even if the appeal was lost it would have been worthwhile as the fact that His Highness had fought for his rights to the highest Court would be of value in any subsequent action for the return of the purchase money. 4 # I have made enquiries in Basra and have ascertained from the Shaikh's agent and his legal adviser that the Bashiya estate is unencumbered and I understand that it cannot be sold or otherwise alienated for 45 days from March 22nd, the date of the decision by the Court of Appeal, or until the final hearing of Any appeal to the Court of Cassation which might be lodged by the Shaikh during that period. , 5.

After Compliments, Our agent at Kao has just informed me that the farmers there refused to deliver the dates belonging to the Landlord as some of them are claiming that they^have sustained a loss and others are refusing to hand over the dates and nothing ha,e been received yet. The agent writes that they have their dates kept in their houses buL they are refusing to give the dates belonging to the Landlord. The agent referred the matter to Mudair al Nahya who has no power to force the farmers to pay. I then went to the Mutassarif but could not meet him as he claimed that he was very busy, so I as^ed Haji Suleiman Faithi to see the Mutassarif and inform him how the farmers were refusing to hand over our share. In fact Haji Sulaiman Faithi saw the Mutassarif who has apologized saying that this case does not concern and finally 0 the Mutassarif informed him that he Insha-Ullah was going to speak to the Mudair al Nahya and to enquire from him what the possession was, but he has not spoKen go the Mudair and seven days has past by and we have received no result.

As to Al-Faddaghiya case, I wish to inform you that Haji Sulaiman Faithi the Lawyer proceeded to Baghdad and on his return back to Basra I will report the result of his meeting with Nasrat al Farisi the Lawyer. Usual Bnding./-v y Political Agency, K\i7rait, 23th April, 1943. / i. 1 Please refer to your letter of the 25th 2. The Political Agent has seen tne letters which I am returning. He was surprised to hear that the Power of Attorney had not 'been handed over to Sikandar ''ansoor especially as Shaikh Muhammad had already told His Highness that the lawyer had oeen engaged and the information has been sent to His Majesty’s Government. He considers it essential that the Power of Attorney he handed over at once so that the necessary registration formalities can be completed row ond he also considers that if it was agreed to pay the lawyer £. 1.0. 100/- now then he must be paid. F6 man can be expected to work for nothing and the lawyer must commence his work of studying the case at once. Please let me know His Highness* decision for the Political Agent J s information. '7 ts regards the fellnhpin at Pao not delivering dates, the Political Agent considers that the matter is one which is purely the concern of Shaikh Muhammad as His Highness* agent and that no doubt he will be advised by His Highness to seek the redress that is open to all land- lords in similar circumstances. 4.

You should endeavour, afterwards, in cooperation with Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan, Amir Abdul Aziz bin laud, and other reliable Shaikhs to lioera&amp;e Basrah from Turkish possession. Should this prove to be beyond your ability, you should ma^e arrangments, if possible, to prevent furnish reinforcements from reaching Basrah or even furnah, until the arrival of the British troops whom we shall send, please God, as soon as possible. I also hope that two of our men-of-war will reach Basrah before the arrival of your troops there. And though it should be your highest aim, in this connection, to liberate Basrah and its people from Turkish rule, still we request that you should use your utmost endeavour in preventing troops and others from plundering the merchandise belonging to British merchants in Basrah and its dependencies, to protect the European residents of Basrah and to safeguard them from loss and oppression. In return for your valuable assistance in this important matter, I am ordered by the British Government to promise to Your Excellency th it if we succeed therein - and we shall succeed therein, please God, - we will not return Basrah to the Turkish Government and we will not surrender it back them at all. Further ore I ivaice to you, on behalf of the British Government, cerbain promises concerning Your Excellency personally, viz: (1) that your gardens which are now in your possessions viz. the date gardens situated between Fao and Qurnah shall remain in your possession and in pO' se sion of your descend ants without being subject to the payment of revenue or taxes. (2) that if you atLaex Safwan, Umm $asr and Bubiyan and occupy them, the British Government will protect you from any consequ ences arising from thet action. (3) that the British dovernmeno does recognise and admit that the Shaiuh&amp;om of Kuwait is an inde endent Government under British protection I request that you will be good enough to read the enclosed letter and transmit the same to the Amir of Najd at the earliest convenience. I have addressed a letter to the Shaikh of llohommerah similar to this I am writing you. I am confident of your old-established friendship with the exalted Government and I believe that Your Excellency v/ill use your endeavour, in these important matters, in every respect.

The Foreign Office however considered it advisable for the question of arbitral rn to be carefully studied before vhe Tigh Commissioner was auohorised to use it as a powerful persuasive and suggested that the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown be sought. The memorandum which was drawn up on the subject for their perusal dealt mainly with the immunity from taxation wide of the question. 4.

Legal advice was tanen by the Shaikh, and his Baghdad Counsel who was a man of greater calibre, than the one regained in 1941 considered uuat the Shaikh should take the case to the dourt of Cassation though there was but little chance of success as he would thus have gone as far as it was legally possible to to to recover his property. It was Counsel’s opinion that the Shaikh had a reasonable chance of succeeding in a suit for the retu n of the original purchase oney. This advice was in contradiction to that tended in 1941 but in view of the greater erudition of the counsel, Nasrat &amp;1 , e Political . u-ut mvA &lt; - accepted snd so it was and a reference was to have been made to the Tourt of Cassation on Lay the 1st 1943.

Bear jir, ke ^r-tiiy; ;ase of Basi.iyah iToperty . v/ith referenoe to our recent conoersations regarding the above property, I beg to confinii that I have studied this case in the light of the documents, which are in niy possession, and as a result of saioe I hog to state as follovs:- 1, lhaiKh KubaraK s-3ubah # •urohased from 3hafiqah daughter of Hafidh Offendi, and wife of ,KLi al Zuhair, her share and that of the shares of 3'ier ninor children, totalling 145 shares out of 216 shares in the property, situated at Aaddagiyah, and rtnov.-n as the Bashiyah, for the value of T.Liras 3034/38, which amount was received by the aforesaid 3haflash in cash, and that in accordance with an agreement dated 31st Kohorram, 1324, signed by the naid parties* In 1938 Kis Highness, 3haihh Anmed As-3ubah, was dispossessed of the sal t purchased property, owing to the &lt;Jidgrtents passed by the Iraqi Courts, which held that the sale was void, for its non registration in the Tapu Office. Similarly the Land Settlement Court decided the case in favour of the heirs of ,li Pasha al Zuhair, for reasons ~nown to you, and I belle e that reference has bs-n made to the Cassation Court, Baghdad, regard!n the judgment of the land settlement Appeal Court. As you arc ulreecy aware, t e heirs of ohaiKh * ubarak As-3ubah, have decided to sue the sellers of the said properties for the return of the purohnre money paid by ChaiKh LuturaK .s- 3ubah, and I have been appoints by the said heirs to prosecute this case. On dlscussin the aforesaid case recently with Naarat Beg al Fariei, Advocate, Baghdad, I found, to my greet astonishment that he was of the opinion that the uairs of Shaikh ubaraK were not entitled to claim the full amount of the purchase price of T.L. 3034/38, from she aforesaid Bhafiqah and her children, on the ground that the seld 3haficah had sold the shares of the minors, in her cajacity as an Executrix, clone, without participating with the other Executor, Ahmed Pasha al huhair, who were both appointed as such by a Decree passed by the Bhare Court, J^asrah, on the 12oh liOharrum, 1324, and as such he opined that the sale of the minors* shares, by one of the Executors, could not be binding on the minors, I then explained to him that the said f'hwfiqah had sold the shares of her minor children on the authority of a decree passed by the lhara Court, on the 2nd Ifoharrum, 1317, copy of which was in my possession which per itted her sell 119 shares out of 216 shares of the aforesaid property Known as 'Bashiyah', which Include her shares and that of her minor children, with the exception of the share of her son, -ibdul Baxi, who ha i proved his majority at the time when the said decree was issued, on the ground that the said property was spoilt for non cultl ation and that the minors did not benefit therefrom as the value of the crop would not meet the cultivation expenses etc etc, and as such vae minors were liable for the return of their shares in the puronyse price. Nasrat al fnrisi was surprised to hear of the exista \ce of the aforesaid Decree and as such agreed with me that a suit rtf- a - V| could be filed a^ein.-t the iuinorg and ihallqah or ^helr heirs for the reiuad of the full aurqhase .-rice of T«L*3054/38, on the ground that the said sale was authorised by the hire )ourt and as suoh I a-a exceedingly olcasc.' for my appoint *ent in this case existanon of tiie sola important 'i ;ra lourt decree hlch bene . its the heirs of lhaikh l utsrak. I am sure that if another Lawyer was appointed the amount of whe claim woul; havf been conx'inad a :ai.ist the estate of the said lliafi' ah only, wnich would mean th&lt; rea .iaa .ion of a very stun 11 amount therefrom, whereas now the suit c.ta be filed against Slafiqah an i her children, with the exception of fodul fa« i, i,e. the shares of hafiqah and tuat of her sal,; children, in -he said property, can be attached provisionally against the full amount of the said purchase price, an^ this would maxt a .cry substantial difference in the amount of the claim# On studyiru th- ease, I gave my opinion that the said case v/vs time barred in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Limitation dot i hioh was in force in Basrr.h only for a few years and that if -lit case was properly defended it would have been dismissed for the said reason. I explained that there was a very small chance for success in the •. ppeal inasmuch as the Lawyer, who had defended the case had ad: it ted in the Go art while pleading for the application of the Indian Limitation Act, befir# ascertaining w ether the legal period he. elapsed o * otherwise, that the possession of the aui ; pr :pe *t,v b&gt; the lete Shaikh ■ ubarax as- :.ubah, had a tern, t d from the cr. te of the agreemen o of mkm sale i.e. dlst ^oht rraii, 1327, lereas on calculation of the period, from the date of -ht said aareement upto the date of -he it a peal of the said act, the ill 12 years, ; v'vi^ed in the said ,ct, for ihe possession of an immoveable property, was IncoBiplets, and as such the said ce e was n t bi; a 1 rred. On the ot it r hr 1, on st idyin* the c acur.ents, I found a document v/hich s x&gt;ke of possession of the said property b&gt; ;ihai^h ivubarak a few months earlier than the date of the said a ,rcement of safe, and if posaessicn of the saia property was pleaded from the date of the said document, the action woul. have been time-barred, and the Courts ould have dismissed this action. i. ;vin been -ressed to r oal the said juduent , ins ite of the failure of the a peal, for the aforesaiu reasons, I then lodged the a.&gt; eal an- I prosecuted the cuse peraonally. The .appeal Oou t, In uismissinr the saia appeal, held that the Indian Limitation let was applicable in this case but on calculating the period, between the date of the said sale agreement a d th€ date of the :epeal of the said Act, the Court held that a period of 11 years and about 10 months only had elapsed and as such held that the case was not time-barred by the said ;.ct. The said Court, did not admit the possession of the s* id property prior to the date of the said u'reel ent, in view, of the clear a imission of the Lawyer, of iis III gun ess ihaikh \humd, who defended that the possession started from the date of the u reeme .t, which was absolutely wrong. Mrther on reading through the plet linrs of tlffl ouoe, I1 t»v«ui*nfcioned point, I suggest that this i, port ant legal point may j.lease be oomunioated to him as it will obviou^iy ubara.o al 3ubah # V', r your ; inforha i ion 9 a lana 'settier.erit case was rec^utlv deoiled by the Jasaation Oourt which ic raoticallr ; sii-.iler to this case. In this said case, hhaidh hhiazaal had ven to one of his sons a la ip e property, situated at Lu&amp;ta, Basrah, by way of a -ift, according an ordinary deed, fhe other heirs op. c ed tais girt on the ( round thaw 1 it - was not / registered'in th^'TapU Office. ?he‘ 1 Land 3'etftl'eaeiit court, Basrah, held that'since the land wes ^1:1 ri n and the trees h ulk M therefore the gift was valid as, the planat ions and the trees were considered as uoveable properuy which could be disposed of, in any way, by an ordinary deed. •he Land Settlement Appeal Court confirmed the judgment o. the Lawer Court and on revision, the Cassation Court, Baghdad, confirmed the jud ynent of the said Appeal Court. The case of the heirs of Shainh Mubarak is similar to thi aforesaid case oi the heirs of Sheikh hhasaal inasmuch the effects of sale or a ift are the same. In both cases the Appeal and Cassation Courts held, in blu case of the heirs of Ahaiich nhazaal, that the ift is valid, owing to the fact that the trees planted on liri Land are considered as moveable property, I do not sec any raiical reason why the Cassation heirs of Shaikh , ubsrak holding that the sale, as far as the tre&lt;-s are concerned, are valid also. Therefore I suggest tint judgment. I read the Judgment, passed in the case of the heirs of haiKh^ ubare , b, the ^and ettlement Court, Basrah, I am of the opinion that the said heirs had a very s-ron case* If the pre faction of the sale, and said case had been r^rope. ly prosec uted by the the said &gt;hara Court Decree, which permitted , Liz rel ‘ ance on fne point tha*- the tx*ee 3 were moveable property together with the fact of the continual, long and undlstrubed possession which bars ail-action for recovery under the land Settlement Law. I a* sure the Baaruh Court would have decided the case in favour of the heirs of V- • di -s’ . a „ 1 During my recent visit to Baghdad, I was informed by Nasrat 3ef5 al arisi that he hoi no hope to succeed in the' Cassation court on the ground that the Appeal v/as not filed within the legal period. I explained to him that since there was a n her ,h)u i for reference i^ was - orth to resoi't to such a Court since this case 'as an i.. port an u one. He agree ’••ith rr.8 in this respect and I understand he has already filed his revision. If he makes use of ihe said shaxa Court Decree a co &gt;y; of which I can supply at ne, and argues oho validity of the agreement, of stue, as far as the trees are concerned, which ar ;muent the Land Settlement admits, I am confident he will have a substantial chance for success, unless there are reas which prevent the Cas-a&amp;ion Court fr&gt;m enuerin into the 'eta:*Is of this cose, which reasons I am not avaire of. Assuming tiiat the Cassation Court rejects ^ho revision, the only raoaarsa open before the heirs of Shaikh Aubarak is to ertlim the refund of the pruchase price, as at'oresaid. ■'he he rs of /Hi Pasha &lt;1 Suhair, whose shares nave «cold, may plead thao such an action is Lima-barred but such a defence is re .1 actable on tbie round that the lieirs ox* :;aaxidi right to sue for the recovery of the pruohaee price arose in 193 £ and as such the oeriod of linitation bad n t elapsed. \ssut.ing that the right to sue for r- fund of the oruchase price arose in 1932 t when the case 1 as ecided finally by the eel Jourt, held the invali.: iiy of t e 3 ii sale, the case is alro within time as the period of 15 years hr-d not eiepsed bet v een 1932 a:id 1943 # herefere/is very important, as agreed by as, that ail Cassation Court rejects the revision then an a,pp] ica^ :.on be ::.a(.e inatodiatcly for the provisional ettachi'.ent of thereby prevontin bhe u.utrs ror ;,r. nsferrinr their shares in the soil property* It is most essential to pr .oe the sale 1 - rreeaent n ori jinai oj v it a cert‘fled copy to t/ir Jou:t of ’’irst Instance, Basrah, when applyl for the said attac'iment as without wMoh no Court can uive and order of en attacuaont on an ordinary copy of the agreement, such as -he one 'which is in my possession.

Sir / toysfour I have the honour to refer to^your endorsement Ho. 8-S of January 5th and to enclose a copy of a letter from Shaikh Muhammad hin Ahmad As Subah, the Agent for His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait’s estates in the Basra Liwa. regard to the area of land 'which the Basra Port Authorities please see tl^ ^rrespondence ending with Baghdad letter ? T o. 38/1/36, dated the 7th of August 1936. The second is a more serious matter and concerns the reclaimed land on the river bank in front of His Highness* Pao estates. In this connection please^||e the correspondence beginning with my letter No. C/829-5/2 dated 30th August 1942. 3. I have discussed the question fully with His Hlghnesi and indicated to him that as regards the area which the Basra Port Authorities were desirous of acquiring in 1935-36 j he should instruct his agent to make an immediate reference to the Land Settlement Officer whose duty it is to examine just such claims as these and decide the ownership of dis puted property of this nature. His Highness stated that he agreed vith my view and would cause a letter of instructions to be sent to Shaikh Muhammad without delay. 4. As regards the reclaimed land on the river side of Shaikh Muhammad raises two points. The first is in were anxious to acquire in 1935-36, in which connection the property I have advised His Highness to instruct Shaikh Muhammad immediately to bring the action of the fellahin and the Mudir of Pao to the notice of the Land Settlement.Officer for th^t official has not yet given his award and the action of the Mudir of ?ao would appear to he premature to say the least of it. I suggested that Shailch Muhanmad should press the Land Settlement Officer to indicate if he had any intention of refusing to register this land in the name of the ‘Is Suhah and if so for what reason. His Highness promised to act in accordance with my advice. 5. I fear there is little hope of a satisfactory solution to the problem of the land reclaimed from the river which unlike the reclaimed land on the Thor Abdullah side of the property has not been planted 'with trees for the stipulated period of JTS time and cannot therefore be registered as 'Hiri granted in Tapu' under Article 10 (b)(iii), and (c)(iii) of Land Settlement Law 29 of 1933. It is *!Iiri not granted in Tapu' land in my opinion and as such would have to be dealt with under Article 11 of the Taw which clearly indicates that ‘’Lazma' can only be granted to Iraqis. Thus although His Highness has enjoyed the usufruct for the requisite number of years he is debarred from having the land registered in his name by his non-Iraqi nationa lity much as his grandfather was debarred from registering the 'addaghiya estate owing to his non-Turkish nationality. I anticipate that the Land Settlement Officer will act in regard to the registration ofrthis land as indicated in naragraoh 4 of my letter So. C/S29-5/3 of the 30th august 1942. 6. There are only two ways in which the Thaikh f s interests can be safeguarded if my reading of the situation is indeed the correct one and they are either to persuade the Iraq 'Government to amend Article 11 of land Settlement Law 29 of 1938 to enable the Land Settlement Officer to register this reclaimed land in His Highness * name or to advise the Shaikh to endeavour through agents to make the best arrangements he can with the new owners possibly by having the land registered in the names of persons among his tenants fr 1 endlyJ'disposed towards him and immediately acquiring control over the reclaimed area by means of long term mortgages. 7./L 7 If it were possible to adopt a firmer policy in our dealings -A/ith the Iraq. Government than it has 'been hitherto I would/strongly advise that they he approached and asked r ,&lt;&gt;J to make the necessary minor adjustment in their law to ensure that His Highness is treated with Justice and equity. However our policy being what it is I do not advocate any such approach for it would be so much time wasted and I suggest that His Highness he advised to pursue the alternative course suggested in paragraph 6 above.

As to the case of Faddaghiya property, I have already informed you that our opponent has been informed of the decision of the Court on 5th Kay, 1943, and which was in our favour and the opponent has not yet appealed to the Court of Cassation to see it. But even then, T still consider that there may be some appeal to the Court of Cassation, so I have spoken to His Excellency Ali Kumtaz and have obtained his agreement to accept to act as the lawyer in the aforementioned case, in case it will be put in to the Court of Cassation. I have prepared a written memorandum in this resuect which will exolain the case to the said lawyer, if it added to the detailed memorandum which I had then put in to the Court of C°ssation a co w of which T had already sen^ to you.

Their Deputy is the lawyer Hasan Abdulrahman. The President of the 10th Settlement Committee, Fao Branch, had passed ;he dectigjfcn re^ardin^ the land .No. 31 and 35 of the estate No. 3 of al-Faddajjiyia, whose i original shaies are considered as 216 shares, of which 36 shares belong to my clients and 180 shares belong to the Apellees, the heirs of Ali Pasha az-Zuhair, and that they should be registered as slated above. As the 180 sharea which were to be registered in the names of the Aooellees, ar^ tne legal property of my clients, all the Appellees have no right at/ to have these shares, an.d that the decisions of the President of the above- *■ mentioned Settlement Committee have been appealed against, mni to the/Court of Appeal of the Land settlement, Baghdad, the Deputy of the Apellant has asked the aforementioned Court, by the way of an opposite Appeal, to examine the decisions- under consideration and to si ad abrogate them in this respect and to have the/shares J . aforemen tioied registered m the name of my Clients. But the/Court has informed us after seeing the case on 2.2-3-13, that she has decided to reject the request of my Clients, &lt; because the dcislons ejaint.t which the appeal wat&gt; :naie, have been cone’'lereci as correct iecisions and that their request was put in after the expiration of the legalThe reasons of the TTiemo- ranlum to the Court of Cassation. time, it Aas stated in their prospectus attached here- with, under serial number 43 dated ^2- ’- ±3. ) The decision of the Court under consideration is untrue and it nrejudice my-Clieots..I therefore request that it may be examined by the way of Cassation and be rejected. I also request that a decision should finally be' reached dec id ini the rejistration of the shares under eonsidera- tion in the names of my clients,for he iollovini reasons*- (l ) Re rd i n j; the Validity o t th e A.pp gali - The Lar* of Settlement did not investigate the oooosite anneal, but it is undoutedly a special law, and •*■*■•*'*■ » i , nr in case of any case which has been neilected(silenced) it refers to what is defined by the General L^w, which is in this case the Law of the Regulations of the Code of Procedure -vhich permits the opposite appeal, especially V. % », the main ta^et of the Law of Settlement is to decide the rights of having a free hand in the land, and Articite4^0) of the Law of Settlement, which defines that cases of Settlement should be seen if no req-est has been made in connection with them. The rejection 0'' my clients’ V-v request by the Court of Appeal of the Land Settlement, does not rely upon any Legal Document, as far as form* regulations are concerned. ( 2.) Regard ing the Origin,., * The Law of Settlement deems it necessary thot the shares under consideration should be registered in the names of my Cilents for many reasons, and the following are some of them:- (A) My clients have had a free hand in the aforemen tioned shares for a period of time which is double of what is necessary ^or the procession of time, as per the Gazette and the Law of Settlement, i.e.since 132C Kijriya until the later years. The A pellants did not have any free hand in these shares, and this deemc it necessary to neglect their document in this connection according to Article 6 g &gt; of t*he Law of Settlement and maxes it necessary to have the said shares registered in the n-:«mes of my Clientsper Article 10 of the eaTie Lew. As to Rafia* bint All Pasha az-Zuhair nh her havinj ob..ained a judgement in her favour against one of ay clients, i.e. Shaitch Ahnaad al-Jabir as-Suoah. The Judge ment stated that he should not oppose her rejardinj her shares of the aforementioned shares, and this judgement was carriei o-&gt;t in l^o8. This was beyond my Client’s power who could not stop it, b^t even then this natter only refers/to &lt;vhat the aforenentioned Rafia* has claimed ajainst Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir as-Subah, and it does not affect in any case the other shares and tree rights of my other clients in those shares. ( B.) The free hand which mr clients hat had, can .alone prove their rights in the aforementioned shares, and deems it necessary to have them registered in their names, but the said hand is proved by the documents ’-'—- and deeds which proves that my clients have purchased £&gt;10 said shares for Lar^e amounts of money, and ohe of these documents is dated '&lt;£lst Muharram, l-5&lt;i^, Hijri/a, and the other is dated 14th Rama dhan, 15^^, nijri a. It i ^ ^ui te evident that the Law of Settlement, according to paras 7 &amp; lo of the same Law , has considered such documents and it defines to act accordinj to Vtu***' The decision of the Court of Appeal of the Settlement which had considered the iecisiou of the President of the Settlement Committee, to be untrue. This consideration is not correct, and it is rude clear by the following facts.- ( A. ) The President of the Settlement Committee has taken the Judgement obtained by Ra.tia’ bint A1 i Pasha az- Zuhair ajainst one ot my clients, i.e. Shaikh Ahmad al- Jabir as-Subah,as mentioned above, one of the reasones of ^ decision while the Law ot Settlement has ta.^dn into consideration the fact of having a free hand and has count it'as the basis for the decision of the ownership of the land, and it has not investigated the judgements of the Courts oni hid not paid a speoial attention to them. Any- hoM, it judgements of the CiYdl Courts &lt;tre ever to be4 ■v tv*on i.ne cons i tion in regard of the cases of Settlement,' they are not to be con-jiiered more than a document vhich is real adopted &gt;when it agrees wich the/free hand, and it will noc be mor^ effective loan the Documents of Tapo, vhich are ne elected when the free hand is oroved against therji. In the cases under consideration, my clients’ right to uave the abovementioned shares registered in their names owing to their having a free hand for a long time, is a clear % matter and it should not be neglected, depending on the aforementioned judgeements. The decree the 1st Instance Court vhich was sanctioned .by the Court of Appeal appertain to a single rrv person of the Appellants and similarly to a single person of the Appellees,vani it has nothing lo do with the others of tne both parties, as the case,which has resulted this decree, was filed personally by Rafia’ bint All az-Zuhair a ainst Shaikh Ahmad al-Tabir as-Suoah. For this reason, even if the said decree was to ^e ta*ten into consideration from this point of view, the thing which we are not prepa red to accept, even then, this decree will have no effect^ and it should not be depended upon except in connection with the shares in dispute be ween the Appellant and Appel lee in this csbe. ( B.) But the seconi reason on which the President afo r erne n tione d of the Settlement has depended in his/decision is, his being of opinion that the sale which took place outside of the rah o Office is not to be ta&lt;en into consideration, while the Law of Settlement considers the documents of such sales, as I have already mentioned. It is made clear by the abovementioned reasons that fiqo go^ree cassei b/■ the President of the 10th Settlement Committee to have + be 180 shares of the two propefties •egisterel in the names of the AppelUk&amp;te, and also the the decision of the Court of Appeal of the Land Settle ment which rejects the request of my clients for the annulment of that decision, both were not correct, I therefore request the annulment of the decision,againstTranslation of letter dated 6-6-43 from Iscaodar lansur, Advocate,Basra, to Shaikh Mohammad al-Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah, Basrah. After Compliments, According to your request I ^ent 10 Baghdad on 13-5-43, in order to dis cuss «vith H.E. Nasrat al-Faresi regard ng the Bashiyah case and to get a co l in- tersigned cony of the document^ date gardens. As soon as I reached Baghdad 1 communicated 'Vith the Court of Cassation and found out cha t the members of the Cassation had already investi- . , &lt; ; ■•• •* / :&lt; j t j \ g n i v . gated the memorandum written by Nasrat al-Faresi for the Court of Cassation, e j ■' 4- containing the purchase of Bashiya but they have ietained the decision of the case until H.E. Nasrat al-Fares.i in the beginning would oroduce the Powers of Attorney which were not/in the file of the Sett- lement, and when I had investigated all the files of the Settlement which were sent by the Court of Cassation of the Settlement to the Iraqi Court of ao f - . r Cassation, I did not find the original document of the sale, or any copy of it so that I would be able to obtain a countersigned copy of the'^ame. I, then . &amp;£* ^ i 3 . • J , J \.i- • \ : \ ' v . v h i f»i&gt; f. communicated with the Court of Cassation of the Settlement, and after a long v‘ d c F search and investigation of the case and '.he files concerning the Faddaghiya case, 1 could not get the original Document of the sale or any countersigned . . ■ 3 ■ ■ i • i J F .. ef ' , , .... 1 N cony of it. As the case is very important I wt telegraphed my clerk in Ba-sr-s and asKed him to communicate with the Land Settlement, Basrah and to ask them ^ the aforementioned document was in posession of ih- Committee in Basra ~&gt;r not. He telegraohed to me saying that the file of tne Court of First Instance eiijf on n f : of Basrah, which contained the original document, has oeen sent to the Court of Appeal.,, of the Settlement of Baghdad. On receiving this telegram, I again i i ^ communicate*! with the Court of Appeal of the Settlement and after the inves tigation of all corresoodencesrepeived from the Settlement Committee of Basra i and the statements of the papers submitted to Baghdad, I did not find the t *' 0 J - - • ■ j l 0*3 c*: : OO * i .■ J ' 1..

The ae.-noraniu*' contains ail the FT-3 Settlement, as the anneal wes not nut in durinj the le^al oerioi. As to the origin of the document of th% sale.or the ohtaininj of a countersigned copy of it, I have told H.E. Nasrat el-?aresi that I woe quite surprise 1 that the file of the 1st Instance was not to be found with the files of the Settlement. I therefore have osked him to examine his papers carefully, tecaose he might have a countersigned said copy of the/document. After &gt; careful examination of his papers, we found a countersigned copy of the said document, in one of the files, this dociAment contains the sale of the shares of Aodulbaki ax-Zohair of the Bashiya property, so I received ohe document from him. According to he informations ^toted above and which I had obtai ned during my visit to Baghdad, I returned to Hq,sra immediately and started to oreoare the oaoers for the execution by the vay of security and all the papers of guarantee etc. to ask for t- e execution by the way o f security of all the property, pialm trees and the lands of EashhaA fcr the amount of the purchase money. I am waitin^ for the decision of the Court of Cassation in this case, so that I may know whether tr.e he pase will/accept«^or rejected. If the aforementioned Court will decide to reject the appeal of Cassation, I mil then immediately ask fcr the execution of the property by the way of security and &lt;vill inform you later of the result as soon as I get any other informations in this connection. .

Their deputy is Sa^ed Hasan Abdul- Rahman. In continuation to the the application placed by my colleague, Sayed Nasrat al-Paresi,the lawyer,oeinj the Deouty of my aforementioned clients, I put in this written memorandum for trie explanation of what is stated in the said application. 1. All the documents and oaoers which orove the riphts of my clients in the lan Is unier consideration are kept in toe file of the Court of 1st Instance of • Basrah, under Ho. and the 10th Land Settlement Cpmmitte nas received those documents and papers durinj the time they *ere seein^ the case, and have kept them in their/files appertaining to the land Ho. 31 of the estate No. 3 of al Faidajhyie. I have found out that this file has not been sent to the Court of Appeal of the Land Settlement,and so it has not been sent to you. Ao it is very important to see these documents . - and papers^ to bs op&gt;ite sure of the rights of my clients, I request you to issue an order to fetch them from said the/Committee of the Land Settlement an d to postpone the seeinp of toe case to that time. t - • ' t * 2. '■!/ clients’ rights in the lands under consi- t der-tion are quite cleir for the following reasons:- ( A. ) : JIy- clients hni a free h-ml of the said lands for about 3 ; years, an i most of the plants\f ' - 2 - existing in th^: nforenaentioned nronerty nre the result of th^ir planting then there an 1 of their having spent iar^e amounts of money. This fact can be prove! by examining tne ape of the orees an! the date-palms existing ; .here, vhile th e ^ ellees i &lt; . did not have any free h nd in the lands unier consideration during the same periou. Tiic ^eadinj^of the Lav of Settlement t 1 say quite clearly that the claim of the Appellee should be re in this re spent jected and my clients riphts/should be established. &lt; * . : « iu * &lt; , As to the protestation of the Appe tlee-that Raf i a * az-2uhair had obtained a judgement apainst one of my clients,i.e. Ahmad al-Tabir As-Subah, preveatinp him from opposinp her havinp a free * hand in her shares,and that this Judpement was carried out by^~ the execution in 193S. This io of no benefit to them, because the said judpement concerns the shares of the said Rafia’ alone, an i it was passed apainot mv abovementioned client alone. Suppose that the sail Judpement will have any considerat ion in this res- •nectthat consideration -vill be regarded as far a.o Hafi-a’s shores are concerned, and can not be used for protestaion a ,ai.ost my other clients. Moreover, the Law of Settlement has decided that the riphts denendinp on a free hand should be considered, and they should not be neglected, except in case the free hand is neglect ted. The situation vhich was the result of the Judgement carried out in V 1938, should not be- considered in any cas*e as negligence of the free hand, committed by my cli-nts, but it vas,in fact a powerful rower, w ich ^as the reo.lt the execution of the power vhich sho Id not be resisted . ( B*. ) • In addition to the .fr e hand of my clients for a period of time which is double of what is required for the proft^° of time, according to the iazette and the Law of Settlement, my clients’ rights in the lands under consideration, is proved also by their superseding the previous person who had the free hand, and that was since thirty five years ago, as their legator had purchased the lands from him according to two iocuments, of which bn^ is iated llth Muharram, 132’ 7 , and the other is dated 14th Ramadhan, 131 17 , Hi jrya. These two documents are kept in the L file^the 10th Land Settlement Committee, vhich I have requested to be brought. Your respected Court is veil aware that:-1. The reelin.^b of the Lav of Settlement defines the necessity of of ta'&lt;inj; into considerstion/the correct documents which contain the fact of one receiving the ri hts from another as far as the land is concerned. This is made quite clear by the wording o-r para f 2- b of article ^ ) and f 2- c of Article 10) of the s'id Lav, especiallv that my clients 1 doc meet, which proves that they / have superseded the previous person who had the free hand and have received from him all these rights, and this is proved by their having a fve* hand for ^ period which vas double of vhat is req uired for the process of time. 2. The abovementioned lands are date-jardens, and most of them have been planted by i-y client, and a decree ^as passed by your respected Court on 'Hh July,1942, under number b/942 of the Court of Cassation of Settlement, which states clearly that the palm- and trees are considered as tran. ferrable and it is not neC o bS ary to ave them registered in the Tapo Office in case of buyinj or selliny them. As the property under consideration,inc luding nalm-trees and trees, have been purchased by the legator of my clients, since 35 vears, according to the abovementioned documents which are ^ept in the file of tne Settlement, it has according to the Law become necessary/that the property should be registered in the name of my client. For these reasons I repeat what my previous colleague has requested. (Sgd.) Iskandar Mansur, Advocate._ ft o tt Political /'i.gent, Kuw ait.

I have the pleasure'of informing you that the Court of 1st Instance has passed th^ decree , oaccordiqgo.tt which we have obtained an injunction to rest rain the heirs of Ali Pasha az-Zuhair from selling or otherwise aliena ting all their share of Bashyia prperty or produce thereof. I im enclo sing a cony of my memorandums in which I hove asked for execution by way of security and they ore both signed by.me, and also the copies of the two decrees in regard of the execution by way of security. I hove os*ed for execution by way of security, depending on the twcj countersigned cooies of the two documents of purchase which I hare found with H.E. N srat ol-Foresi, as I hove not found the original cor ,ip B 0 f the documents in the fil* of the Settlement which is in the Court of Cassotion. As it is very essential to produce the original conies of these two documents, becouse the court will not be able to see the case or to ptss any judgement,unless thes two documents are produced, owing to the necessity of having them shown to the opponent and to s^e if the signatures contained therein are signatures of the sellers or not, and as I cokid not find the original copies of the two documents neither in the Court of 1st Instance nor in the files of the Settlement which -ere sent to Baghdad, I therefore request that an in vestigation and careful search may be made to find the original copies of the two documents and have them sent to me as soon as :ossible, to enable me to carry out my wor k in this respect.

His Highness, prompted hy his son Muhammad al Ahmad, has had further misgivings about the risk of future law suits between members of the al Jabir and has asked that the property be registered either in the name of •Hakim al Kuwait' or that the members of the family of Jabir which he has specified in the v enclosed note be specifically excluded from the registration. ilas (iocumen ' ts prove that, in considei’ation of certain settlements, these members were excluded from participation in the estates of the deceased Jabir*but is nervous that, if the estates are now registered by the Land Settlement Committee in the name of al Jabir, it will be arguable that these documents have been abrogated,,and that the excluded members of the family will prefer claims to shares of the estate. ^ To obviate the risk of further law suits, therefore, he has asked me to request you to take cognizance of these documents now^and, if you are satisfied as to their authenticity, to register the property in the way he suggests. If you feel that such an enquiry is outside the terms of reference of the Land Settlement Committee and is not feasible i perhaps you would consider the possibility of recording a note in the registration stating that registration in the name of al Jabir does not affect the validity of any documents previously signed which have extinguished or curtailed the rights of certain members of the al Jabir.

The lawyer has decided to appeal against the decission of the Court. I was at Fao *hen the casetwas seen by the court and nad to stay there for five days just to arrange the estimators for the property. The following arrangements are required to oe done in order to oreserve our rights, because as r B hay£ understood tnat the &lt;-ao oeople have reached an agreement among thenseives that no one &lt;vill offer any liaoility( &lt;-j ) and their intention is to eat the'crops, and so ^e a.e to guard our rights. Fao requires at least fifty guards for the protection of the dates. I have tried to get guards from Ba^ra but I found out their salaries are very high i.e. six Iraq Dinars each one of the guards and this is what tb£ others here are paying. Fadlaghiya requires twenty four guar is. Mutawaa f requires four guards. I am executing your orders, and wish to a-now whether you want me to engage'tne guards and pay such salaries, if so , please Let me know before the ie;arture of the guards, as it will be hard to get any. to M Fao property, this can be managed easily if the autho rities concerned would interfere in the case in order to protect our rights, so that whenever I ask H.E. the Mutassarif anything about reserving our rights,he will be ready to hear me and there we will be able to reduce the number of the guards. Fao is also a prohibited territory, where no foreigner is allowed to dwell or liv p unless he obtains a oermit from the Mutassarif* a.nJ moreover it i* pretty hard to live‘there by a Rationing card. «e will have to obtain ration cards for a^l the guards.

The folio, inr - v;ent to Sasrah and celled at the Consulate end Jua^e hood in his chambers in Court, I give below the result Ox my investigations and consultations, O v* W *' ^ B.-XIIYAII . (a) You will recollect that originally I advised against a suit foi the return of the purchase money and p'-rve my reeeons for doing so in my leuter No.C/545-2/5 of 4th' ocuooer, 1941.

The case was heard in Basrah in August ohe verdict was given for the defendants. During my intent lev/ with Judge ^-ood on Wednesday he regretted that thev heu oeen forced to give the decision against Ills Hi 'hness in^ Basrah and expressed the view that thc'shrikh had no iuis statement was volunteered and as X did not feel could properly question the Judge about a case which gathered he had himself tried J did not peruse the a PP? a f ba3 bten lodged in Baghdad but no date of hearinr nes yet been fi: ed. ^ case, that I I matter. vby j.n view of the Jud e # s statement and for the reasons given previously I have little hope that the ca^e succeed on appeal or on reference to the Court should such a reference be V W to make v. monetary payment dispossessed of will of Cassation ■■■■ necessary and consider.d desirable. de should therefore be prepared to the 3halu.h in compensation for his being property v; e had^guaranteed should remain in his possession, xn order to i^ti-ate the feeling of chagrin which he will doubt i eel et our failure to fulfil our undertaking I v*iet our monetary payment should bo prompt and ■ no ionsider generous. It will be recalled that so'far any request th t the numerous he h has not made — sums expended by him on lawyers and in -ourt fees in fighting this long battle for the Bashiyah should be in whole or i,n part met by :iis Majesty’s Government. This point should in my opinion be taken into consiJeration In oemputing the sum to which he will be entitled. I suggest that suia due to His liighness in Judicial verdicts. *eps os taken nov, to ascertain t the event of further adverse he 3. Hi XCjVCITAH dACC, .-’Ulainan Jhavvwaf has made a rex^erence to the Court of Cassation and .'ill run tar the hiaikh’s Baghdad advocate hes put in a written reply. His Highness’ oase is a stronh one ^nd it is probable that the verdict will be favourable ■ i but by/ The Hon’ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Shiraz..'VI v&gt;l^r but by no means certain. Nothing is in law. Should the verdict be favourable a tiresome case will be finished. Should it be unfavourable we shall hove to work out and add up some very disturbin' figures. 4. FAO. Judge Oood informed rse that he had decided in His Highness* favour and that the decisions had been written and were being typed and would be made public as soon as the maps were received back from ohe Baghdad Survey Office. So far so good, but iu remains to be seen whether the wording of the decisions leaves a loophole for the inter.Hnoble law suits beloved of the asiatic. I fear it will. 5. The position at Feo is not particularly satisfactory for it stems that Suleiman Shawwaf has been down there and has been inviting the fellaheen to confide their troubles to him. He is understood to have enlightened them with regard to their rights ana the somewhat invidious position that the ovmer of the land must remain in until uhe estate is actually registered in Tapu. He seems to have a friend in the employ of the Fao Section of the Basrah Port Directorate who keeps him in ormed of events. 6. As far as I can unaerstaad the position the fellaheen are now eolleeting the ,f - •ind—falls* and disposing of them without reference to the owner. The ovmer also fears that before the time for dividing the season’s crop they will have smuggled the majority of the dates across the 3hatt-al- Areb. The owner normally has two judicial courses open to him. He can prosecute individual malefactors if he can obtain reliable evidence or he can evict the, erring tenant. The first course is expensive and te ,ious as it might be necessary to ?‘i le several hundred esses which owing to the difficulty of obtaining evidence would not necessarily be decided in the owner’s favour. The second and most effective course is dangerous in the present circumstances as the estate not being registered a court might hold that His Highness had no right to evict any of *he fellaheen. This interesting position has, I am informed, been made xnovm to the fellaheen by Suleiman Shawwaf, 7. L’here are non-judicial ways by which the Shaikh could safeguard his interests and one of them is by appointing watchmen to supervise the fellaheen. Shaikh f oh acuta d bin Ahmed, His Highness* agent maintains that he has been unable to induce Iraqis to take on the work and conso -neatly His Highness decided to send some of his o a subjects to Fao. Unfortunately however Fao is a prescribed area unier an Iraqi Defence Hegulation and no foreigner may proceed there without a permit from the Hutessarifijah. The feutesserif his Informed 3haikh I'olummad that Ae does not favour the grant of permits to Kuwait watchmen, very natural, as there probably would be some bickering and scuffling at 1 Fee before the watchmen end the fellaheen saw e^e vO eye. 8. I celled at the Consulate-General to discuss the matter but discovered that Knight was on leave and both Cl ham nd 4:. .hire were out. As the time of tueir return was unpre&amp;icSble and I had a greet deal to do I asued the head clerk to acquaint the Consul with the facts of the case and to tell him that I would instruct Sheikh Hohammad to call upon him and di cuss the matter. I felt th t possibly the Consulste-Ceneral could press the Futessarif to help Shaikh Mohamad to find watotaan or in the alternative^ I . ct the F.udir-al-Nehiyeh at Fao to take an active interest in affairs and a vise and induce the fellaheen to behave themselves. I also suggested to Shaikh Mohammad that he should call on Shoem.dth the Port &gt;ireotor at Fso end acquaint him with the part his employee was alleged to be playing and ask hir to warn uhe individual if investigation showed the/V-' 3 the alle 'ation uo be true.

The Iraqi Court of Cassation was formed in Baghdad on 30th Sep tember,1943, under the presidency of Dawood Samra,Assistant to the Jud^e, and the membership of Arif as-Seweidi and Hasan Kamil Tatar# authirixed to pronounce judgement in the name of His Majesty the King of Iraq, and have pronounced the following Decision:- The Appellant: Wajeeha &amp; Abduljalil son 4 daughter of Jamal and Sulaeiman al-Shaw*f, the guardian of Kamal Abdulla ai-Zuhair, the insane, in addition to the legacy of Awasha az-Zuhair,Bajyiah az-Zuhair and Abdulla az-Zuhair. B Basra, The Respondents: Ahmad, Hamood,i Miriam sons and daughter of Jabir bin Mubarak as-Subah, and Bazza bmt Sager al-Ohanim, &amp; Munira bint Moha/amad ad-Dabbus, &amp; Tif- la bint Shabeeb al-Rashdan, &lt;8: Abdulla,fahad, Subah, leebi,Ayesha,Hissa and Sabeeka sons &amp; daughters of Salim bin Mubarak as-Subah, and Lilwa bint Mohammad al-Juma* Sc ^adhha bint Basir al-Wadia* and Salim,Jabir Sc Shaikha sons and daughter of Ali bin Salim bin Mubarak as-Subah,and Hissa bint Salman al-Hamood Sc -asmyia bint ffalah al-Reiqan, and Subah,Lilwa,Bazza and leebi,son i daughters of Kasir bin Muoarak as-Subah, and Mubarak,Xhalid, Jahad, Sharif a, Nashmya and Nasmya f sons Sc daughters of Hamad bin Mubarak as-Suoah, and Abdulla bin Mubarak as-Suoah. Tne President of the Land Settlement Committee of Fao District has issued decisions to the effect that the plots numbered 35,36, 37,38.39 Sc 40 of the estate No. 3 which is called al-Jaddaghyia, aie to be considered as Amyryia Land authorized by'Tapu' to the Res pondents, whose names are mentionei above, i.e.Jabir Mubarak as- Subato and his colleagues, as their ownership of the land has been proved. When the appellants appealed against the abovementioned decisions, the/Court of Appeal for Land Settlement has decided on 21-3-43, by joined Nos.224, 225 ,226,227,228,229/941,to sanction the said decision and reject the appeal of the appellants and to make them bear all costs of the Courts. A s the appellants were not sa tisfied with the afore mentioned decision, they requested that they may take it to the Court of Cassation to reverse it, so all the documents were auumoned and carefully examined, and it was found out that the plots u ider consideration are the following Boa (35,36,39,37,58 Sc 40) of the estate No.3- Taddaghyia, and thus the Court of Appeal for Settlement has decided to confirm the registe- ration of 'the first three plots, for having been registered in M Tapu' and to register the other three plots again, as it has been proved that the respondents had had a free hand in the plants of the said land. When all the^seen by the courts .»ere examined, it was found out that these plots were originally the property of Ayesha az-Zuhair, the legator of the appellants and were registered in,.£he name of Shaikh Mubarak as-Subah, the legator of the respon dents, on behalf of Awasha az-Zuhair in a common dociment. As the two parties could not have the registeration decided at the H Tapu ' Department during the Ottoman Rule, owing to some political prob lems, the registeration was sanctioned in the presence of the Bri tish Consul/on 21st Muharram,1326, When Basra was occup ed by the Iritsh in 1915, these plots were then registered in the name of the heirs of Mubarak as-Subah. This registeration was carried out by the man who was then acting on behalf of the Civi, ^dministratio in the H Tapu M Dept, in August,1915, relying upon the sanction given by the British Consulate and it .as not oonnme^by^the^o.ji^ior °VtUr g ?eL?or remained haring free hand in these plots upto and th.ir -&gt;g tvip-atatecof having a freehand in a land by tn-.- 2 - naakes it necessary to neglect the rights of having a free hand, and it has been proved that the respondents have had the free hand in the land for a period of about thirty five years and that the appellants have neglected their rights of having a free hand in the said land during the same period, and that the judgement passed by the Court of 1st Instance of Basrah on 15-6-1938 under Bo. 373/193o, /vhich contained the cancellation of the KHAKABYI4 Documents given to the respondents in August,1915,as the regis- terat ion had not been reached in the^Tau', such judgement is only a document which the Court may consider, and as the decision had not reached the final stage; and this was proved by the fact that an appeal was taken to the Court of Cassation, according to the power practiced by the Court of Cassation to examine the said judgement inspite of the fact that the legal time was expired. When this Court saw the case, it was found that the settlement of these plots had already been published, and so the Court sent the case to the Settlement Committee for them to examine it, and ihe negligance of the said Judgement by the Settlement Court of Appeal was the right thing to be done and the Judgement which has been taken to the Court of Cassation was according to the Law, and so it was decided to sanction the said judgement and that the a peHants are to bear all the expenses of taking the case to the Court of Cassation.to ?&gt;&amp; oi 3i »riJ Jter( eraxi 3 1 ^fe^nocxee*! fcs&gt;voiq need 8#£i SI bn* S*sii bnF 3Vi7 Jtfodi 5 Jo ftoiieq f 10 ^ bn*l sr&lt;d nx tru?rf fcnajcl ^oal a 'io vSn^i? risdt teXo^I^^n ev^rf sinFlI^qq^ Jn:&gt;ire tin irti J*i \ In* .fcox^eq 9^8 sxiJ ^nxi^Jb bn*I t&gt;tp&amp; acfS nl jsbru 8£ej-d~ -l no cisieeii Jo soneStinl Soj lo t'xuoO sx^J yd l&amp;zaBcr *11UJ&gt;X ii? 9iiw k oox^fJ i *or*'0 erU r^.oxnV ,&lt;.£^I\C^': .ote’ oiiS a* t C 4 &amp; l t i&lt;iVhW ci fe^natincqaai art^ oJ navi^. aano^^ooG yino 8X dnej^fci u xini;© nx fcaxtoasi no^d don rfd noidaied d£xlt So*J add yd fcpvoiiq ©xrtf brg? ; 9 ^b 48 .
