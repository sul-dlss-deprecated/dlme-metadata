Kickinbotham, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain . Sir, I have the honour to draw your attention to the serious increase in pilfering of merchandise being landed both from the Manama and the Sitra anchorages. 2. I am given to understand that pilfering takes place in the holds of the vessels discharging cargo, when the cargo is being lightened to the shore, and in some cases when the cargo is awaiting discharge from lighters or the opening of the Muharraq causeway bridge. Coolies working cargo appear to be fully aware of the most profitable cases to open for it is generally packages containing expensive goods in great demand on shore, that are tampered with. From statements which have been made to me I believe that infor mation is conveyed to the thieves by intelligent persons who have access to ships' documents prior to the cargo being discharged from the ship or at any rate landed from lighters. 3. It has been apparent to me for some time that consi derable dissatisfaction was being felt both by import merchants and the general public at the very serious losses which are occurring as a result of pilferage between the ship ana the shore. The mercnants who met me as usual today for the weexily conference on trading matters again drew my attention to what is really a very disgraceful state of affairs. One member went -so far as to declare that an official of the shipping company was actually present recently when a case was pilferred and did nothing to protect the property of the clients of his firm. It was also stated by another person present tnat he had recently bean on board a ship and seen coolies and a police man carrying piecegoods away from the vessel without any attempt being made to prevent them. I suggest that/fc time has come when drastic action must be taken to prevent pilfering and to bring those engaged in this nefarious practice to trial. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Messrs. Gray Mackenzie and Company with the request that every endeavour be made by them to prevent any leakage of information about cargoes for it is their duty ana chat of their employees to use their best endeavours to protect goods entrusted to them by shippers. I suggest that they should instruct their employees to make an immediate report of any pilfering that may come to their notice.

Dear Sir, HB: BRID02 TOLL TICKETS File #280 062 Please refer to the State Engineer's request of August 1944 that the Company order Uanama/liftiharraq Bridge Toll Tickets through their Hew York Office. » This order has now arrived and : we to-day telephoned the State Engineer notifying him of the arrival, advising him that the cases had been pilfered and suggesting that a responsible Government employee be sent to take delivery. The loss on account of the pilferage is not very large (600 4 annas and 300 5 annas tickets) but we feel that you should know the cir cumstances. A report on the condition of the cargo in the holds of the s.s. •William 3. Meredith' showed that it was in good condition, although of course we did not have a specific inspection of the two cases containing the tickets. The Company pecking list, a copy of which is passed to Cray Mackenzie &amp; Co., showed that the cases contained tickets (without mention of kind) for delivery to the Bahrein Government. It is evident that the Gray Mackenzie A Co. coolies were informed of the contents and realising that they might be the equivalent of cash made efforts to ensure that the cases were broken. The cases were sturdily made but were handed over to us in a broken condition - of one case the whole of the top had been removed and one side plank of the second was smashed. The cases were repaired at the Company Storehouse immediately after checking the contents It is suggested that it may be possible to trace the thieves by marking with a rubber stamp those tickets that are officially Issued so that when unmarked tickets are presented the person presenting nay be held for interrogation. Ihie above is indicative of the conditions generally existing at Sitra during the unloading of cargoes. Yours very truly, ORIGINAL SIGNED BY W. P.

It has been brought to my notice that men of the Iraq Levies who arc stationed at the Muharraq side of the causeway are searching all coolies who land^ there from dhows working at unloading steamer Iuan y cases I am told that they confiscate goods in the possession of the coolies. The Bahrain Government is most anxious to do all that is possible to prevent the pilferin- and stealing from ships cargoes which is now rampant but^ at tl e Scn.e time I do not consider that it is suitable that foreign troops stationed in Bahrain should, without previous reference to the Bahrain Government, carry out searches among the civil population and confiscate goods without reference to courts or to the police. The Bahrain Government would welcome the co operation and assistance... of the. Iraq Levies in preventing thefts of this type but before the Levioo taxe ciction outside their own camp area tne Bahrain Government should be consulted. Adviser to the Government.J GONFIDh^TIAL . Ko.
