After Compliments. ^^ I have been honoured by the receipt of your letter dated 21st December 1937 corresponding to the 18th Shawal 13h6 and was acquainted with its contents. I am grateful to you for'the kina attention which you have paid to the question of certain individuals of my suojects who found a chance and ran away in order to avoid the duties which they were bound to perform during the season. As previously stated by me, this action is contrary to the rules which ought to be observed in such cases. It might also lead to difficulties which can potentially be avoided. As these divers are my subjects and were working in the diving at Qatar, they are subject to the prevalent customary rules of diving. 1, therefore, request you to send them to me so that I may summon them with their nakhudhas and make reasonable enquiries into their accounts with their nakhudhas in accordance with the diving rules in vogue. They(divers;will then be given the option of either paying c their debts or joining th^nlShudhas according to the usual custom followed in such cases. I shall be very grateful to you if you will kindly have this matter settled. iJ M {fit Usual Eliding.Confidential Political Agency, Bahrain, 12th January 1938 No, C/35-4/13.

From the old Besiclency files I have extracted and precised the follow ing : In 1766 A1 Khalifa Section of the tribe of Utah emigrants from Nejd migrated from Koweit and settled in Zuhara. By 1782 the A1 Khalifa has succeeded in establishing their supremacy over the whole of the Qatar peninsula and in this year attacked the Persian Governor of Bahrein and captured the island. From this year to 1842 there was continued fighting and confusion. In 1842 Shaikh Abdullah of Bahrein quarrelled with bis grand nephew, one Mohammad bin Khalifa, and drove him out of Bahrein. Mohammed bin Khalifa went to Qatar and rebuilt the town of Zubara which had been deserted since 1811. In 1847 Shaikh Abdullah, at the invitation of Shaikh ’Isa bin Tarif of the A1 bin Ali, made an abortive attempt to reduce Shaikh Mohamed bin Khalifa and died the following year. Apparently one Shaikh Mohamed bin Thani succeeded Shaikh ’Isa bin Tarif as head of the A1 bin Ali tribe during the next decade, and rose to power in the Qatar peninsula. In 1867 and 1868 a series of raids and counter-raids between Bahrein and El Qatar ensued in which the Resident interfered and deposed the Shaikh of Bah rein Shaikh Mohamed and fined others heavily and Shaikh Ali, bis brother, who had commanded the forces of the Shaikh of Bahrein, was installed. Shaikh Mohamed bin Thani in 1869 signed an agreement with the Resident promising to pay Shaikh of Bahrein 9,000 Krans “ Zakat ” a year, to refer all disputes to the Resident and to maintain with Shaikh Ali bin Khalifa the same relations which had existed between himself and the former Shaikh of Bahrain. This money was paid for the npxt two or three years and then discontinued when the Turks established themselves in El Bida. Colonel Pelly decided on the occasion of this settlement that while the Bahrein Chief was acknowledged to possess certain rights of pasturage, etc., on the Qatar coast, he should not be empowered to put to sea to coerce any Qatar port. In 1869 Shaikh Ali was killed and after a short interregnum Shaikh ’Isa his eldest son, was made Chief of Bahrein by the British Government. From this date on, the Turks attempted to extend their influence in this part of the Arab Coast.19 In 1872 Shaikh ’Isa expressed a wish to re-establish a garrison i n f and check the intrigues of his relative Nasir-bin-Mubarak. Colonel Zubar#; ported to Government that in his opinion the Chief had not tect the tribes residing in Qatar and had advised him to remain neutral Bosi s re th e power top ro J| In 1 875 the Government of India definitely warned the Shaikh of Bahrein tl f' the consequences w'ould be upon himself if he became involved in the mni i To this the Shaikh replied that he submitted to the orders of Govt ^ ^ but did not consider his rights to Qatar invalid or extinct in consequence er wnent In 1879 Shaikh Mohamed bin succeeded. Thani died and Shaikh Jasim bin Than 1 In 1890 Shaikh Jasim intrigued to get a Turkish garrison in Zub tra El Qatar and from then onw T ard for several years negotiations passed bet J His Majesty’s Government and the Porte to evacuate these Turkish ports ^ | In 1895 a division of the A1 bin Ali under Shaikh Sultan bin Salama I a from Shaikh’Isa to Zubara where they w ere encouraged to settle by Shaikh Jasim under the Turkish flag. A naval expedition went to Zubaia and a no^ i tion of the A1 bin Ali were persuaded to return to Bahrein, the others went to Bida. In 1901 Shaikh Ahmad bin Thani, who had succeeded Shaikh Jasim wishpT to come under the protection of the British Government, but, owing to Iressulk from the Eoreign Office and the Ambassador at the Porte, the project of makin* the arrangement fell through.

There are ^Ikiill points, however, over which a ruling is required. As I understand it, the ?rm neighbouring Arab Eulers” refers to the inhabitants of Qatar Peninsula nd Nejd. Is it intended to refer to the inhabitants of Oman, Kuwait, Zanzibar, Cadramant, Yemen, etc., the inhabitants of all which places are to be found ' ere trading at all times? In other words are local, resident subjects of the 'fillers of Oman, Kuwait, Zanzibar, Hejaz and inhabitants of Hadramant and ’emen to be considered under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Bahrein or nder that of the Political ^ gent ? A ruling is required on this point as Shaikh : sa certainly thinks he should control them. Point 2.—I have nothing to say except that up to the day of his depar- ire, my predecessor was carrying on a correspondence with the Shaikh of Bahrein over this very subject. The Shaikh had dismissed a member of the ! %i/Majlis-al-Urfi ” and had appointed another member without the knowledge approval of the Political Agent. The circumstances suggested an attempt to ake a test case to see how far the Political Agent would be supported. The Political Agent contended that under the Order-in-Council he had UEvery right to be consulted in the matter and refused to recognise “Majlis- -Urfi ” until Shaikh ’Isa withdrew his nomination. My predecessor went i:*,ivay at this stage of the crises and it has been left for me to settle the tangle, certainly consider the Order-in-Council is clear on the subject and should 3 insisted on. In the meantime the Majlis-al-Urfrs sittings have been sus- tilfiS, (feonded pending settlement of this vexed question. Pomt 3. The question of Zuhara .—I have been through a great many files i the subject and have consulted confidentially various local people of rominence, without, of course, divulging the reasons for my questions. The inclusions I have arrived at are that it would be distinctly unwise to allow fiikh Isa to occupy Zubara. On the following grounds :— rCf jfe («) Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim of Qatar would strongly resent the Shaikh of Bahrein again getting a footing on the Qatar peninsula. He is a weaker man and Zubara in the hands of Shaikh Isa would be a pistol at his head always. (5) Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim wmuld certainly object to the develop ment of a new port on the peninsula of Qatar since it would at once divert all trade from Dohad (Bida) to Zubara and he would not only lose a la.rge amount of revenue at present accruing from the Customs House A1 Dohah, but would stand every chance of seeing Dohah entirely disappear as the seaport of Qatar. Ibn Saud similarly would take offence at a revival of the port of Zubara under Shaikh Isa’s jurisdiction for like reasons to (fi) above, as such a port would mean the killing of his new trade centre of O’Jair. It should be noted that the harbour of Zubara is naturally much better than that of either Dohah or O’Jair, and with the Shaikh of Bahrein actually compelling all Bahrein trade to go to the mainland through his port of Zubara, the end of both Abdullah bin Jassim’s and Ibn Saud’s ports would be certain and quick. As matters stand a good deal of coolness already exists between Ibn Saud and Shaikh Isa owing to the latter having recently instituted a 5 per cent, tax on goods passing through Bahrain for O’Jair even though such goods never leave the Bahrein C ustoms House. Ibn Saud contends that Shaikh Isa ^ should only take demurrage charges (or Arthiyeh). H In my opinion the suggestion of Shaikh Isa’s that he be allowed to revive Isten year-old controversy should be nipped in the bud. The new move aii i fie# lulero is/ / \ obviously an attempt to extend his power territorially aad financially at i expense of Ibn Sand and Abdullah bin Jassim and will only end in troub Further I consider it is the thin edge of the wedge to Shaikh Isa laying alri - his claim to be ruler of the whole peninsula of Qatar, which claim n definitely I gather quashed some fifteen years ago. I attach a small sketch map to illustrate my remarks regarding Zubara. Regarding point 4. I have no remarks to make.

As I informed you verbally two or tliree days ago, the Shaikh of Qatar told me on my recent visit to Dohah for the purpose of smuggling. He informed me that he has no objection whatsoever to Bahrain boats going to the Qatar Coast from Khowair round to Dohah for the purpose of collect ing juss, but he says quite definitely that Bahrain boats going to the western coast will be forcibly driven off. I . undertook to inform you of this. 2. So far as I know Bahrain boats are not supposed to visit Qatar at all and presumably if any are going they are doing so without permission from the Bahrain Government. I would however suggest that nakhudas and boat-owners be in formed that they may be shot at if they attempt to land along the west coast of Qatar. 3. It is of course high time that nomal relations were re-established between Bahrain and Qatar and I trust it will not be long before there is some indication that Bahrain at least is prepared to resume them. that Bahrain boats keep on visiting the west coast of Qatar Political Agent, BahrainC/131-4/13.

In the first place, consider*ing the circumstances which have given rise to the proposal, it seems to me that the Bahrain Government are contemplating the use of a steam hammer to drive in a tin-tacki Secondly, I fail to see what object can be served by action which must necessarily tend to exacerbate feeling between Bahrain and Qatar, particularly at a time when I was beginning to hope that there might be some rapprochement between the two countries in the near future. Thirdly you will no doubt remember that in your letter No. 861 dated the 21st August 1937 you informed the Political Agent de finitely that the despatch of goods from Bahrain to Qatar had not been prohibited. If it was unnecessary to issue such a prohibition then when feeling was running so high it scarcely seems necessary to do so now. 3. This letter is perhaps rather strongly worded, but as you know it is not only my duty but my inclination to do all that is possible to restore disturbed relations to normal, and the present proposal will certainly have the opposite effect. At the very least I think the Bahrain Government might well post pone consideration of this proposal until they are satisfied by wore than one example that their interests suffer by leaving wel! alone. After all many messengers have passed between myself and the Shaikh of Qatar in the last few months and we have had one solitary example of an attempt to export goods to oatar.

As an instance, he quoted the case of one oi his cousins, Nasir bin Khalid al Thani who, he said, went to Bahrain 2i months ago by an invitation .from Shaikh Hamad through a messenger who came to i^atar for this purpose ana thcxt,after getting money from Shaikh Hamad, Nasir returned to ^atar and induced another person namely, Saif bin Abmad who is also a cousin oi his(Shaikh of Qatar); both leaving secretly ior Bahrain about 20 days ago where they are still living. He added that when those two individuals arrived in Bahrain, Shaikh Hamad gave them generous sums oi money so that they may stir up trouble for him and encourage m r»? j fl f .! ■ i i iii mi ii hd others to do as they did and thus harm his prestige in ;^atar. mat when he heard of this matter he snet for their brothers nprimanded them and obtained an undertaking irorn them to the eiiect that when their brothers return to Qatar they should not allow them to go to Bahrain again. Finally, he requested the P.A. to make some arrangements so that none of his relatives are given permission to come to Bahrain . The P.a* promised to look into the matter on his return and , . . h give the necessary advice but said that he could not pass any order in the matter as it is the concern of the Bahrain ^Government to give or refuse permission to any Qatar subject coming to Bahrain. 30/5/38.mi- ©;Q) * 9 X X X X X X X X X X X In regard to those perspns who went stealthily to Bahrain through disrespectful propaganda about whom I told you* that from what I understood the Bahrain Government had prohibited all Qatar subjects from entering Bahrain without exception, other than those of whom the Political Agent made an exception in his letter. In that case how am I to take the * action of the Bahrain Government in allowing the entry into Bahrain of certain Qatar subjects who went there v/ith ill intentions and without my and your knowldge. This is contrary to what has been decided officially by the Bahrain Government themselves# On what ground the Bahrain Government pass an official order prohibiting Qatar subjects from entering Bahrain and then give permission to some of them. Had the Bahrain Government not found those persons as a means for carrying out their propaganda, they would not have given them permission. I request you to consider this matter and not to allow any Qatar subjects to land in Bahrain unless it is done through you or on your advice. The order should equally apply to all my subjects, the inhabitants of Qatar and others. Since * the Bahrain Government have announced, through the Political Agent, the issue of a prohibition order against subjects of n Qatar, the order is to be carried out properly. As I have already explained to you, the Bahrain Government, by giving admission to those who go stealthily to Bahrain, have an have been sending messengers and money for duping the simple people and persuading them to disturb the peace and cause ill feelings. You may, of course, realise that harmful propaganda is not acceptable by honourable people and is not allowed by all laws, I hope you will consider this matter fully and by your sharp thought realsie the consequences of disturbing the peace and tranquility. They (Bahrain Government;such a thing. I have to inform you that should any of those who went stealthily to Bahrain come to any port of Qatar secretly by Bahrain boat, I will be compftlled, according to rules, to take legal action against the people and the boat which carries them.

I enclose herewith for your infor mation a copy of a petition which they have presented to me.

I think T am right in saying that you told me then that you were quite prepared to help your relatives if they returned to Qatar and lived there as your faithful subjects, but Saif bin Ahmad complains that when he went to you a few days a go and asked for your assistance it was refused.

I nave receivea your letter No.C/43b of 1938 dated 3rd July 1938 corresponuing to btn Jamah al Awwal 1357 ana understood what you have written about our verbal discussion and our corresponhence in writing with regard to Nasir bin ,.V Khalid and Saif bin Ahmad who went to Bahrain at such a time j 4 when it was not proper for them to go on account of the propaganda of others. I discussed the matter with you vei^bally and confirmed it in writir^ stating that a propaganaa is being organised in Bahrain for influencing the simple persons who snow slackness in their patriotism. As a result of such a propaganda Nasir bin Khalid and Saif bin Ahmad went(to Bahrain)and as you are aware, they went (to Bahrain) through the propaganaa which I have pointed out above and therefore this behaviour on their part indicates their disloyalty, ill intentions and breach oi the duties of their holy country. These individuals did not disclose such inclinations during all these years when they were very prosperous and comlortaole but they were dragged by others to their side with an evil intention to use tnem as an instrument in harming me, but the matter is not oi any important as they will not be successful m their imagination.. When I discussed the matter with you my object was to acquaint you with the real reasons on account of which these people w^ere mane to go to Bahrain. When I ashed you that some arrangements should be made so that such persons should not enter Bahrain, I based my request on the present circumstances and the prohibition .mposed by the Bahrain Government through the Political Agent against the entry of Qatar subjects into Bahrain. Therefore, the duty calls that the prohibition shoulu be enlorcea against all the subjects of Qatar, and the Bahrain Government have no right to interfere with people who are not their subjects asthis is the concern oi their own ruler. It is necessary that no Qatar subject should be permitted to enter Bahrain so long as the situation continues to be as it is now other than those about whom I write to you and obtain your permission. This is the procedure that should be followed m the present circumstances. This shows that the Bahrain Government would not allow anyone to enter Bahrain except those who are not patriot and can be used tor their propaganda against Qatar. This, ol course, is not permissible by any just rules, and the Bahrain Government have no justification in doing so. Under these circumstances I discussed the matter with you so that you may be aware of the real causes for all these affairs as I deemed it necessary to point out to you and draw your attention to the consequences of such acts. This matter prompted me to have a discussion with you not only about these two individuals who went or were invited to go but to reveal the facts to you which cannot be concealed. 0 T Political Agent J I am sorry to say that you did not think and did not look into the real facts of the mattjea^ In regard to tde petitiorTsudmitted to you by the petitioners and the one similar to it signed by those whom you have mentioned m which they have alleged that they were hard up, I have already explained to you that in the past they were well off and did not complain of any poverty etc. But in view oi the evil intentions which they had in mind, this excuse was made by them by the propaganda of others. In order that you may be aware of the fact, I am going to clear the position to you. These people and others, as they have told you, were earning their livelihood from the sea and the economical depression was a general one by which all the people of the Gulf were afiectea. They told you that they were earning their livelihood by working at sea. They have no right to claim anything from me but as they were my relatives, I usea to support and help them as far as possible. Above all this, I had forgiven them lor many acts which they had done but they neither realised all tnfi-oe nor have observed tne rights of the country, but on the contrary theyhave become an instrument in the hanas of others for carrying \\ out their propaganda etc. They have now been influenced by tne propaganda ana intrigues ol others with whom they are in league and they are acting against me and behaving contrary to what I haa hoped. For these reasons they do not deserve any help or pecuniary assistance fro me. In regard to what they have told you that they are starving and in need, they have told a lie as they are more prosperous and richer than any other person of this country. Previously they were very grateful to me and did not make any complaint as they have none now but they have changed their minds by the effect of the propaganda of others. O’ Political Agent! one should be cautious about such people who should be turned out ana given no aid so that they may understand how to observe their duties. These are the things which I wanted to explain to you and hope that you will give you full consideration to them ana will understand the real meaning of my letter. I hope that you are in good health ana prosperity.

I have heard from one or two sources recently that there is a good deal of family ill-feeling in Qatar since Shaikh Abdullah bin ''asim refuses to disgorge any of the money he receives from P.C.L. in the form of allowances to the poorer members of the family. On my last visit __ /a k *U V to Dohah the Shaikh complainefh that the' Bahrain Government were encouraging certain of his relatives to go to Bahrain where they were given money in order to stir up trouble and spread propaganda against him in Qatar. He mentioned in particular the cases of Nasir bin Khalid al Than! and Saif bin Ahmad. At that time I said that I thought he could go a long way to discourage hostil propaganda by making reason able provision himself for the various members of the Shaikhly family* but 1 undertook to look into the matter further on my return to Bahrain. “• Shortly after my return to Bahrain 1 iter from Shaikh Abdullah bin asim repeating his complaints, and atar tamilj were able to evade the ordinary prohibition on 1 made enquiries here how it was that certain members of the the entry of ^atar subjects into Bahrain.

Shortly after wards Naeir bin Khalid arid Saif bin Ahmad came to see me anct submitted a petition complaining that though their old income from 'the sea' had now ceased, the Ruler of Qatar refused to give them any assistance, and they had m nothing to live on* This was followed up by a petition in similar terms from several others of the A1 Than! fa mily* I then wrolJe ^to^tke Shaikh of Oatar and told him of these complaints, and suggested that he would do well to make provision for his relatives, thereby earning their gratitude and their undivided loyalty, I added that if he would write to me promising to do so I would do my best to ensure that all the Al Than! now in Bahrain should return to him.

I have little doubt that there are faults on both sides, but it is a fact that the Shaikh of Qatar and his son Shaikh Hamad k-eu a very tight hold on all money which they extract out of P.C.L. in the form of concession payments, wages ot representatives, and the share of the wages of local workmen which I believe they demand from their own people. The amount of the concession payment is kept a very strict secret, as I myself discovered in Dohah; and even Saleh al Mans, as one of the Shaikh's rep resentatives, receives only a minute portion of the amount which he is supposed to draw from the Company as his fee. In these circumstances I do not feel inclined to play Into Shaikh/-€) Shaikh Abdullah bin Casings hands by attempting to enforce a strict prohibition on the entry of any of his unfortunate relatives into Bahrain. It is the Bahrain Government’s own business whether or not they admit any Qatar subjects, though if the Buler of Qatar dealt fairly with his family I should certainly do my utmost to atop any exceptions being made to the general prohibition on the entry of Qatar subjects here# I propose, therefore, subject to your approval, to wri ue a i Inal letter to the Shaikh of Qatar saying that as he is not prepared to follow my advice I regret I am unable to exert any pressure on the Bahrain Government in the manner he desires# X do not believe that the Bahrain Government hac9*-attempted to use his poverty-stricken rela tives as a means of spreading hostile propaganda and he can scarcely expect me to use my good offices for the purpose of driving his unfortunate relatives to desperation* Political Agent, Bahrain■ 7 nnf idential* ^o.47l-S of 1938 British residency and consulate-ueneral, ^uahire, the 26th July 1938« xhe political Agentt Bahrain* 8ub.j ect? 4atar and Bahrain * Memorandum • Reference paragraph 4 Ho • C/468- 4/13, dated the 18 th July of your Memorandum 1938. 2.

I stayed in the P.C.L. camp at Jebel Tukhan and found them all very cheerful. They have built a very pleasant small camp and have nine or ten people there who seem to get on very well together and also with the Catar coolies. They are down to 2050 ft. and are setting casing to that depth this week. Afterwards they start drilling again into what may be the first oil horizon. Thera has been a little gas showing but it is still too soon to say whether there is more than a 50 - 50 chance cf oil. Halations between the Company and the Shaikh are now excellent, after a little difficulty in the late summer which Packer succeeded in putting right. 3.

Yours sincerelytranslation of letter dated 3rd Jamad-ul-Thani*1360 from ti Rule^ of Qatar to the Political Agent, Bahrain. After compliments, ■A'' 1 I have received your letter No.Ill dated 25th May 1941 tooth Rabi/II 1360) and noted its contents. I thank you very much U f , | ^ for your enquiries about my health. As regards the petition sefit to you by one Jum’ ah bin Muhammad I beg to take this opportunity to remind you of what I have written to you in the past in connec- +--5on with such matters. I have informed you that the western section of Qatar is empty and un-inhabited and that journies oo it are forbidden and I have requested you to convey this warning, and that the necessary action will be taken against whoever is found there, and I can recall that you have replied assenting to the matter. I however find that there^certain persons who still eo secretly to those places for unlawful purposes and it became therefore my duty to redouble the coastal guards to guard against persons who smuggle themselves to those places to do certain un agreeable acts. I also take this opportunity to draw your atten tion to what I wrote to you in my lettered 2nd Jamad-ul-awwal 1359 about Bahrain boats which smuggled themselves to those places and^unlwwful acts by landing there while the guards were unaware, and I informedjfthere-in that such acts mxgnt have led to bad results had these persons been met by the coastal guards. I also informed you in my above quoted letter that the situation reached a point at which I find myself obliged to take effecti onthoritv against repeated acts of this measures to assert my aatnori y • 4v^-io -r^aived no encouragement they low kind. Had these crim 12 a—o q. ^ t 0 ^4-c: How many times I have dr awn would not have dared to do such acts. Ho your attentions to these matters and the results which they might Sring! But I find that it did not stop inspito of your dtsurancos to me to prevent it. I think you will recall your reul, to my^ , . Tnmtflh bin Muhammad and his above quoted letter but this person Jam -h o.n . . ,. -n-onf of what I mentioned to you in boat comes as an undeniabl t , . . Thus while the coastal guards were taking their this connection, xnus x. -hich it is prohibited to frequen , usual rounds in those par^w they met this boat and about which I informed you repeatedly -ey and its owner trying to smuggle themselves in those parts for unlawful purposes.therefore the guards had to do their duty in — WCS&amp;- 1 «- 2 - accordance ' with instructions given to them.by arresting the ••bout and its occupants. As I have forbidden and warned, through you, send without effect I deemed it my duty to take the necessary action against these criminals. It would have been well had Your Honour asked the owner of the boat as to why he went in that boat again Tp an un-inhabited place in a stealthy manner. I/kzoi repeat what I I repeatedly made known in the past that whoever may be met by the guards at this place which it is forbidden to frequent^will be considered as an aggressor and as one who smuggles himself for an unlawful purpose and will therefore be arrested by the guards stationed there for the prevention of such persons. I therefore request you to take consideration of this and to make it known as you have already informed me that you have made it known in the past though these persons do not give up their unlawful acts and do not respect rights or honour. By re-examining my past letters to you A you will understand the matter.

He suggests that I might have asked the owner of the boat as to why he went to such an uninhabited place in a stealthy manner* He says nothing about the boat* 3* I must admit that I did not ask the complainant as to why he went to the west coast but he has already given the reason in his application which says that he went to visit his relatives who are living off Kubaijeh.

The complainant went to Qattar, with out permission, to visit his relatives, Khamis bin Mana and his wife Shemma, who live in tents in the neighbourhood of Lisha and Helwan. He landed at Rubaijeh and went inland from there, that being the nearest point on the coast to where his relatives were camping. I have informed His Highness about the matter. The Shaikhs have discussed the case on numerous occasions and would like to take reciprocal action in the case of any Qattar boats which may be caught on the Bahrain coast.

No. 1056 of 1361 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 26th J/Awal, 1361 June 11, 1942. His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - With reference to your memorandum No. 0/787 dated 8th June 194E. No exports of any kind are permitted from Bahrain to Qatar with the exception of water and stores for the petroleum Concessions Limited for which special permission was given by the Bahrain Government. Qatar normally obtains its requirements by local craft from Dubai. 2. The States of Qatar and Dubai were not included in the arrangement which created the RE system for traffic of commodities through Bahrain to certain specified ports in Saudi Arabia. This arrangement, with special provi sions regarding customs dues, exists only between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. 3. I would like to suggest, though I have not discussed this point with His Highness, that if the Ruler of Qatar is prepared to consider some arrangement by which friendly relations may be resumed between Bahrain and Qatar it would be advantageous to both these States, especially at the present time, if the Ruler of Bahrain allowed tran shipment of goods destined for Qatar through Bahrain on similar terms and conditions as now exist between Bahrain and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I feel confident that His Highness Shaikh Salman would be willing to agree to this suggestion if it resulted in restoring amicable relations between the two States wither*, some recognition of the rights of the Khalifah Family to Zubara. Under the present conditions His Highness is not inclined to take any action to help the Ruler of Qatar. In my opinion the present time is more opportune than any time since the quarrel started for an attempt to make a^concillation.

U.EGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. H/n No. ZCiHo jnCsfrt 1361 Office of tile Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 25th Dulhaj, 1361 January 3, 1942. ^ I have the honour to inform you that His Highness Shaikh Salman desires me to address you on the subject of the Arab tribesmen who came over from Qattar to Bahrain during the quarrel which took place between tiie two States in 1937. 2. The Shaikhs of Bahrain have always regarded the Naim, Bu Kawara, Cha’aban, Chibasi and Saada tribes and also some of the Musallam and Sulatah tribes as their subjects. In the old days when any danger threatened Bahrain the Shaikh used to summon these tribes to his side and they formed the bulk of the fighting forces of the Ehalifah. These tribes still supply most of the household servants and fidawis of the Ruling Barnily. In the past many of them settled permanently in Bahrain and are now living in Door, J'aww, Eedd and Muharraq, others remained in Qattar, where they acquired flocks and camels in some cases they took to living in villages but until the Qattar dispute they all visited Bahrain freely and frequently. Hrom C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. To His Britannic Majesty 1 s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, 2/5. After the quarrel with Q,atar, which was partly caused by the • .aiei uribe claiming bo be independent of the authority of the Shaikh of qattar, the whole of the Naim tribe and a number of families belonging to the other tribes crossed to Bahrain and settled in various parts of the islands. A few of them moved to Saudi Arabia, with the approval and permission of His Majesty King Ibn Saud and the Shaikh of Bahrain because they were able to find there better grazing for their flocks. The detachment of 'the Naim tribe who are living on the mainland are financially supported by the Shaikh of Bahrain and they purchase their supplies from Bahrain. They are not subject to taxation in Saudi Arabia. The leaders of the tribes who came out of qattar are in receipt of monthly payments from His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman on the same scale as were paid by his late father. While in qattar most of the men who regarded themselves as adherents of the Khalifah signed documents in which they stated that they were Bahrain subjects. 4. Since these Arabs came to Bahrain they have been officially regarded as foreigners, excex3t those of them who happen to have been born here. If they have cases they appear in the Agency or Joint Courts and they are not at present eligible for employment by the Bahrain Petroleum Company as all permanent employees before they are taken on by the Company are required to produce a certificate of Bahrain nationality. 5. Eis Highness Shaikh Sir Salman wishes the Arabs of these tribes which have come to Bahrain to be officially accepted as his subjects. He feels that his own retainero who are paid by him in many cases and who wish to og his 3/--subjects should not have the status of foreigners* I an, unable to give an accurate estimate of the number of people involved but I think something in the neigh bourhood of a thousand persons from ^attar are now living in Bahrain or on the mainland. 6. I would suggest that those who are now resident in Bahrain should be treated as Bahrain subjects as long as they are in Bahrain. It would be possible to legalise their position, were this thought necessary, by requiring each of them to take out Bahrain nationality papers, though according to our practice we only allow this in case of foreigners who own immoveable property within the State and the tribesmen own nothing. I should be glad to have your views on the subject or, if you wish, the matter could be discussed with His Highness but if the latter course is adojjted I think probably His Highness would wish to reopen the whole question of the Rattan quarrel. I have the honour to be, Sir , Your most obedient servant, Adviser to the Government.NotC/41 0 UUXVl'LLNXlAL Political Agency, Bahrain, the 11th January 1J4S To The Hon«ble the Political Resident in the Persian uulf, Bushire. MKMUKA1MDUM X enclose a copy of a letter No♦ i;440/4bSF dated 3rd January 1943 which I have received from the Adviser to the Bahrain tioveminent • The tribesmen who came over to Bahrain in 193? must have regarded themselves as subjects of the Shaikh of Bahrain or tney would have remained in Qatar and submitted to the authority of the Shaikh of Qatar. Since these tribesmen reside in Bahrain and owe allegiance to the Shaikh of Bahrain, I can see no objection to their being treated as Bahrain subjects. 3. I think it unnecessary and undesirable that these tribesmen should formalise their status by taking out Bahrain nationality papers; but X do not think the Shaikh of Qatar can have any grounds for objection if tribesmen who do not live in his territory and do not acknowledge his suzerainty are treated, as long as they are domiciled in Bahrain, as Bahrain subjects. 4. Will you kindly let me know whetner you approve of my replying to the Adviser that I agi*ee to the suggestion contained in the first sentence of paragraph b of his letter of 3rd January?

As you know they have come before under such pretexts but on medical examination on the launch only one or two of the many passengers who came on the launch (of Bin iiana^) were found to be actually requiring medical treatment, ./e are afraid that those who have come yesterday will be like that party. According to the existing arrangements all such arrivals are to be medically examined on the boat, and those requiring medical treatment are permitted to land with a police escort who will remian with him until he returns to his country. Those not requiring treatment are returned to their country. Their statements cannot be believed nor their actions. They wish to gain entry into our country and try to smuggl goods out of Bahrain. Such bad deeds on the part of these people have occurred in the past. Matters such as these cause us much regret.

But if by the end of this month no reply is received to this letter, perhaps we shall have to inform the petitioners what the position is and leave it to tiieir discretion to remain in Bahrain or return to Qatar, though if they return to Qatar it would certainly be a moral victory for the Shaikh. j Lid (£■ 5 —^U 4 . &lt;v ^ L~ U. . /sjr * ! fe v ,j 6/r' L S.

The Political Resident, after reviewing the claims of both parties, came to the con clusion that Qatar's claims were stronger than those of Bahrain. * : At P a S e are proposals made by the Shaikh of Qatar for a compromise. At pages 230-233 is a letter from the Adviser giving the result of discussions on the Dhaikh of Qatar 1 s proposals. The rock on which all nego tiations broke down was Qatar 1 s demand that the Ruler of Bahrain should withdraw his claim to sovereignty over Zubarah and the Naim tribe. 2» File 4/13/2 ; At page 133 are the Resident’s suggestions for dealing with the dispute between Bahrain and Qatar. At page 195 is a telegram from the Government of India expressing agreement with the Resident’s opinion that Qatar’s claim to Zubarah was stronger than that of Bahrain. A modification was suggested in the form of the reply which the Resident had suggested should be given to the Shaikh of Bahrain. At page 226 is H.M.G.’s reply to the Shaikh of Bahrain's request that they should intervene to protect residents of Zubarah (who were claimed by the Shaikh of Bahrain to be his subjects) from being attacked by the Shaikh of Qatar. % H.M.G. replied that though they were ready to listen to any representation which the Shaikh of Bahrain might make on any matter affecting his interests yet they felt compelled to point out that as long ago as 1875 the Ruler of Bahrain was informed that he should sever entirely his connection with the affairs of Qatar including Zubarah. H.M.G. accordingly regretted that they were not prepared to intervene between the Shaikh of Qatar and the Naim tribe. 3. File 4/13/3 s Page 36 is of interest. The Bahrain Governmeit had been asked why they had raised the transit dues on cargo | and goods for Qatar from 2% to 5% and why they had prohibited / thethe entry into Bahrain of Qatar subjects. in reply they said that they thought that by denying privi leges to Qatar subjects the Ruler of Qatar would appreciate the value to his country of friendship with Bahrain and would, after the present condi tions had continued for some time, be inclined to * agree to some mutually satisfactory arrangement regarding Zubarah. Hasan 4 # Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman^Fakroo (who is a brother-in-law of Yusuf Fakroo lives in Dohar) visited Bahrain during April 1942 and returned to Qatar on April 20th. He visited Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim and claimed to bring from Shaikh Salman, Shaikh of Bahrain, a friendly message. In Qatar great excitement was caused though admittedly there was nothing in writing. Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim and his son Shaikh Hamad thereupon sent over to Bahrain to make further enquiries Muhammad bin Abdul Latif al Mani*. This gentleman is a pearl merchant who lives mainly in Dohar but is by birth a Nejdi and therefore a subject of Saudi Arabia. As such there is no prohibition or restriction on his transit between Qatar and Bahrain. I understood from Mr. Packer that Muhammad bin Abdul Latif al Mani* is a recognized intermediary between the Shaikhs of Qatar and Bahrain. Mr. Belgrave, how ever, told me that this man was not persona grata with the Bahrain Shaikhs and that, if he had not been a Saudi Arabian subject, they would have had great pleasure in prohibiting him from entering Bahrain. 5. Muhammad bin Abdul Latif al Mani 1 left Dohar on the 27th April and arrived at Bahrain on the following day. On the 29th he had an inter view with Shaikh Salman at Rafa*• Only Shaikh Salmanoalman was present at this interview. Muhammad bin Latif informed Mr.Packer that he thought Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa had prompted the present preliminaries to nego tiation. He said that he thought the Shaikhs of Bahrain wanted to send back to Zubaraka small party of Naim who would live there and re-establish Bahrain*s interest in that place. He thought that the Shaikh of Bahrain was anxious to resume his visits to Zubarah and would give as his excuse his duty to look after the tombs of his ancestors there. Incidentally Muhammad bin Abdul Latif al Mani 1 told Mr. Belgrave that Saleh bin Muhammad al Mani* (the Shaikh of Qatar’s secretary) spreads it about in Qatar that - the difficulties about the entry into Bahrain of Qatar sub jects is caused not by the Shaikhs but by Mr. Belgrave. Bahrain he came to see me. In the course of our conversa tion I made indirect enquiries about the object of his visit to Bahrain and the subject of his conversation with Shaikh Salman. He replied that he had come to Bahrain to bring a letter to me from the Shaikh of Qatar about food supplies; and he said that his conversation with Shaikh Salman had been confined to the usual courtesies. He said that he had not discussed the question of Zubarah in any way as that was a matter which it was entirely beyond his competence to comment on. 7 # I saw Shaikh Salman with Mr .Belgrave on the 24th of May. His Highness himself brought up the question of Zubarah. He told me the history of the case at some length and stressed the strong points in Bahrain s claim. 1 gathered that he would be quite willing to see negotiations with the Shaikh of Qatar opened but that he was far too proud to take the first step. The Shaikh of Qatar, owing to difficulties about food supply etc. is also, I imagine, anxious to renew friendly relations with Bahrain but he too would certainly not take the initiative in raising the matter. I suspect that both parties would like the PoliticsO Agent to start the ball rolling. After dis~ — 6 Before Muhammad bin Abdul Latif al Mani' leftV /3 -/&gt;' r f case on its merits with H.H. it seemed to me that any compromise on the question of sovereignty over Zubarahwas not possible. only the parties would agree to differ in regard to the question of sovereignty I do not see why it should not be possible to arrive at a working arrangement which did not impinge on the main issue. Bahrain would like to resume its former connection with Zubarah since there is good grazing there, it is a pleasant summer resort and used in past times to be regard ed always in times of danger as a place of asylum for women and children. I told H.E. that I would sound the Shaikh of Qatar when I visited the pen insula. 8 . Incidentally the Shaikh of Bahrain told me that Ibn Saud as a gesture of sympathy to / • Bahrain allowed through his Customs without pay ment of duty # goods consigned to members of the Naim laftd other tribes who had formerly resided in Zubarah and who, because they owed allegiance to Bahrain, had now been dispersed and livedJin various districts of Saudi Arabia. 25/5/52=^ Afo- c^ 7?7 p(. t fr /tf&gt; ■ /Oirb d .

He showed me a letter which he had received from the Company to the effect that at the request of the India Office they have decided not to recommence negotiations until the cold weather, the letter went on to snow that they appeared to be somewhat dissatisfied with the situation at Sharjah s.o even though they had been successful in concluding their negotiations the matter was held up because the Shaikh refused to accept the Political Agreement and without the Shaikh accepting the Political Agreement apparently His Majesty's Government were not prepared to allow the Concession to be granted. This they considered to be an unsatisfactory state of affairs. I cannot remember the exact wording of the letter but this was the meaning which it conveyed to me. 2. Mr. Lermitte also stated that on the 25th of July he sent a launch to Dohar to bring back the motor vehi cles belonging to petroleum Concessions Limited. His launch had not returned. He was getting anxious and he enquired what advice I could give to him. I decided that I would send Jassim Mohammad the second Interpreter in the Company's' launch to Dohar immediately with a letter from me to the Shaikh enquiring what the position was. This would have the effect of obtaining quick formation for Mr. Lermitte without his going himself and it would also give me an opportunity to send a man to Dohar to make investigations with regard to the number of rounds and rifles issued by the Shaikh of Qatar during the recent trouble and also to obtain information regarding the actual numbers of his forces and also whether they were all of them indigenous to Qatar or w r hether they were from outside. 5. I understand not from a reliable source that the Shaikh of Qatar has used the motor cars belonging to Petroleum Concessions Limited and that they have been very badly/-badly damaged.

His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent Bahrain. - Sir, pS ^ - I have the honou; acknowledge receipt of your letter No. C/579-4/13 dated 26th July 1937 regarding divers from Qatar who have come to Bahrain. 2. During the last month or two about three hundred men, many of them with their families and livestock have been given permission by His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad to come to Bahrain from the north of Qatar. They claim to be subjects of the Ruler of Bahrain and they say that they were ordered by the Ruler of Qatar to vacate the places in which they lived and to remove themselves to other parts of Qatar, others, who took part in the recent fighting, report that their flocks and belongings were seized by the Ruler of Qatar and that they have come to Bahrain as refugees. A few of these men are divers and are possibly in debt to nakhudas in the south of Qatar, but I am informed that not more than twenty men are in this position though there are a number of divers among them belonging to Bahrain nakhudas.2. This is not the first time that divers from Qatar and other states have come and settled in Bahrain and there is a regular procedure im . Bahrain and in other diving states for such cases as these, as on this point the diving law im all the diving states is the same. If a diver, with out a 'barua” from his original nakhuda, dives •**v with a mew nakhuda, the new nakhuda becomes res ponsible for the total debt of the diver to his old nakhuda. If the diver obtains regular employ ment ashore, during the diving season, he is res ponsible for paying tt fasl-al-barr tt to his original nakhuda, but according to diving law and custom the original nakhuda has not the right to claim the person of the diver who may have gone to another country unless he is a slave diver. This condition however would not be acknowledged in Bahrain and I have no reason to suppose that any of the people in question are slaves. 3. In the past when Qatar divers have come to Bahrain the Buler of Qatar has sent the diver's nakhuda or a representative to Bahrain with a letter stating who he is and the nakhuda has produced his diving book showing proof of the diver's debt. If the diver has been diving with a Bahrain nakhuda without a 'barua' the Bahrain nakhuda has paid the -«*v - diver's debt to the Qatar nakhuda. The same pro- v****-. \ 1 cedure has been effective in eases of Bahrain divers who have gone to Qatar and similar eases in Oman and Kuwait. 4. I suggest that now or at end of the diving season Shaikh Abdullah bin Jasim should send some-^ yO, 6 O -c c fr- v' U '^; v • a 4 ' L -3- someone to Bahrain with a list of divers alleged to have come here from i^atar and with their accounts and the Bahrain Government will find out whether the men have been diving and with whom. 5. Normally no nakhuda will employ a foreign diver without a n barua tt and I think it is unlikely in any case at this late date in the season that many divers will find nakhudas. 6. In the meantime should any divers, who have no nakhudas in Qatar, apply to the Bahrain Government for permission to dive they will be allowed to do so and those who have nakhudas will be released on w Barua Rob , a n in the usual way and the Bahrain Government will put the “fourth” on deposit pending a claim from a Qatar nakhuda/.

According to Rashid 1 s report the fT war TT between the Sheikh of Qatar and the Naim all boils down to one skirmish at A1 Thashab in which the Naim lost 4 killed and 3 wounded out of a total of 30, and the Sheikh of Qatar had at his disposal some 250 camel riders, 30 horsemen and 4 cars. 2. It would be interesting to know if the above figures are more or less correct, and can you confirm? Early rumours indicated a large number of casualties, more or less severe fighting, and 7,000 men taking the field for the Sheikh of Qatar, see Deptfords report No.1951 dated the 3rd July 1937, which naturally only passed on local Arab gossip 3. In one of the subsidiary letters connected with the Qatar Oil Concession we promised the Sheikh assistance in case his territory was invaded on a large scale from outside but stipulated that he would have to take his part to the best of his ability. It would therefore be interesting to know how many armed men, judging from '—I his Naim operations, he could at a pinch put into the field and how many rounds per rifle. In the Deptford telegram quoted above the number was given as dO rounds, which seems to me reasonable. Arab Sheikhs do not dish -/out Captain T. Hickinbotham, I.A.

They get dates and other food supplies from Basrah and Kuwait and fruit from Qatif. The prices did not rise as there has been sufficient quatities of food stuff in Qatar when the prohibition wias imposed. I am given to understand that if the prohibition continues for two months more, all the foreigners would leave Qatar as they find themselves somewhat isolated.

Bahrain, 27th Rabi al xhan-i 1356 6th July 1937. To The Editor. we approach you and submit our case before the public opinion against the injustice of the unfortunate British colonization. Tou must have learnt some news of our side the summary of which is that there exists on the Coast of the Arabian Peninsula, which overlooks the Persian Gulf opposite one Bahrain island, a village called Zubarah connected with some other villages which was the abode of Al Khalifah, the present Rulers of Bahrain, prior to their occupation of Bghrain. when they occupied Bahrain they left Zubarah and settled in Bahrain leaving Zubarah unoccupied with the exception of its villages which are occupied by the F a im tribe who are the suojects of Al Khalifah. About 50 years ago Bhaikh ^asim bin ihani, die then Amir of 4atar and father of the present Amir, came and occupied Zubarah which is situated in the S a st of ■^atar. He collected his own tribes and some of Bedouin plunderers with a view to invade the %hrain Island which was then under protection nominally and not practically. Shaikh Isa father of the present Holer Shaikh Hamad, -.rent to the British Political agent at Bahrain and requested him to send away the invaders. Be acceded to to request on the condition that he should erect his flagstaff on the ground which was then on the top of the building, suppress the slave trade, exercise jurisdiction over foreigners and have access to local jurisdic tion. he IShaikh isa) accepted his demands. He went by I |a warship and ordered Shaikh ^asim bin ihani to evacuate 2uharah in three hours' timejfl^ otherwise it would be bomoarded. when the time came and he did not obey the orders it was totally destroyed by shells. ±he Amir ran away with his army and since then iiibarah remained in a ruined state and no one developed it as it was considered to be a dependency of %hrain. Uae and a half years ago a British Company, a branch of Abadan Company, obtained oil concession from Shaikh Abdallah bin Qasim ibn ■‘•h an i &gt; the present Amir of ^atar, for Qatar peninsula, ihe Company's M a nager toured all over the country and visited Zubarah and its dependencies. He found that there was more oil in Zuabarah thafc i-t '■■■’as in Qatar. He asked the Amir to give him the concession promising him British Covemment's assistance. He (&gt;Amir.,) took up the matter, ihe %im tribes were paying to - _ /-\ \ ^ r * Qatar neither Zaicatnor Customs dues as they were considered to be the subjects of A1 Khalifah. He demanded from them customs and zakat on their cattle and the provisions they imported from Bahrain, ihey refused to pay and migrated to 2ubarah. He sent someone to them to tell them that Zubarah was his. they took refuge with A1 Khalifah who gave them assurance and provided them with money, food and arms for defence. After some days the Huler of Qatar collected an arny and marched on Zubarah in order to occupy it and punish the Haim tribes, fhe Amir of Bahrain Shaikh H a mad asked for negotiations and two representa- tives were sent namely Hasir bin Atiyah and his (Shaikh of Qatar's) Secretary Salih bin Sulaiman al Mani'. But they were not successful in achieving any result because there was s foreign nand in the matter. The Amir of Bahrain was very strict about Zubarah; similarly the %im tribes; and the Amir of Qaoar was also the same as they were, fhe negotiations were going on till the end of Habi al Awal 1356 (beginning of June), ihen the Head of the Bahrain Government, who is an Englishman named C.i). Belgrave, ordered the boycott of provisions, piece-goods and petrol against Qatar. On the 1st of Habi al bhani (10th June 1937) Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa3 brother of the Haler of Bahrain, and Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, the heir-apparent, accompanied by this British Adviser left for '^tar in order to negotiate with the amir, ihey passed six days there but did not succeed. After they had returned, a messenger came to the Political Agent from the Amir of ’tiatar with a letter declaring war against Zubarah and ordering his forces to invade it. Al Kftalifah wanted to help them. But the Consul prevented them saying that if they sent any thing they would be responsible to the Government; and he did not allow them to send any thing except provisions and arms. Our Huler Shaikh Hamad bin Isa is away from both the movements^ political and literacy, as stated in your book |'Muslim Jailers 1 '. He is a peaceful man and always seeks the friendship of the British. lighting took place between the i%im tribes and the Baler of ^atar. It continued for six hours and ended in the victory of the i^lataris. I'rom Zubarah 4 men were killed and 10 wounded while from Qataris 10 were killed and 30 wounded, xhe Qataris had three lorries with them; the people of Zubarah had none. All the i%im army consisted of about 1500 souls; the Qatar people numbered 2900. when the news of this incident reached Bahrain it had a very bad effect on the natives, ihey went to Shaikh Hamad and offered themselves, voluntarily, to help their brethren and insisted on doing so. The Amir went to the Consul to inform him of the fact, but the latter prevented him from recruiting army threatening him of the Government's indignation and saying that he would make peace between them. Shaikh Abdullah, the Amir's brother who is brave and intelligent and is feared by the British, told him: 'How can we wait, O' Political Agent; while ieatar army occupied all the centres and would shortly occupy Zubarah which is-our property, as you know, from former times; they would occupy it unjustly and inequitably and you Q.PG pil't’ting US Of*i* dTpoiH clfiv flO ‘jn, « uay UO day .

Order and prohibition is in the hands of colonization^ none of the local subjects can correspond with a newspaper; and nonejis slowed to speak on politics. The warship is still in Qatar and has not returned to Bahrain. The Amirs of Al Khalifah cry like the bereaved and their hands are tied up. 'This is due to this unfotunate colonization. We pray to Cod to relieve us from it. We submit our case to you to look into the matters as they relate to an Arab Country and may interest you end rather interest every sincere Arab.CONFIDENTIAL.

The Naim and their relations, who are claimed by the Bahrain Government and themselves claim to be Bahrain subjects, have always in the past received financial subsidies and food from the Ruler of Bahrain. During the recent distur bances in Qatar, especially during their concentra tion, they had difficulty in obtaining food supplies, some of them were given rice and dates, and others, in Bahrain, were given money with which they purchased food for their families and relations in Zubara. 4. Arms and ammunition were issued by the Bahrain —- 2 - Bahrain Government to all the villages on the south coast of Bahrain and to the guards who garrison the Hawar islands when the disturbances in Qatar began. This action was taken as a result of the petitions which were written to the Ruler by the inhabitants of the south coast villages who feared an attack from the mainland. Certain inhabitants of these villages and islands whose relations and in some cases wives and children were with the Naim t ribe at Zubara crossed over to Zubara and joined the Naim and were present at the surrender when arms and ammunition were handed over as part of the terms of surrender. 5.

I had the honour of receiving your letter dated 9tn August 1937(lst Jamad al Thani 1356) issued from your camp at Karachi. I thank you for the interest you have taken in the matter of the persons about whom I referred to you. As to your statement that the Bahrain Government informed you tnat some persons claimed Bahrain nationality and the Ruler therefore allowd them to come to Bahrain. My friend i allow me to say that this is incorrect and that the Bahrain Government are mistaken in giving you this information. The persons whom I mentioned to you were my subjects and from Qatar. It is, however, possiole that someone has whispered to them and misguided them that the debts they owed would be waived if they run away to Bahrain. On their arrival in Bahrain they were not prevented from landing but were received by the Bahrain Government who promised to grant them documents to enable them to go for diving which made them not to interest themselves or care for the debts due from them or for what they did. This is, as you are aware, an inadmissible and an undesirable act. The Bahrain Government, by so doing have exeesededthe limit and acted contrary to rules to be observed in such cases and encroached on the rights of others. I neither allow nor agree to such unusual deeds and do not think that you also agree to such things. I am sure that had you made enquiries into the matter and investigated the correctness of the same, you would have corroborated my statement and it would have become clear to you that the action taken by the Bahrain Government was contrary to rules and usages to be observed and followed in such cases. The persons v/hom I mentioned toyou have run away from Qatar and left their nakhucmas in the working season and delayed them from doing their' work in the season. They were responsible for carrying out the work in this time. They are considered as offenders by the diving experts, then how could it be desirable for the Bahrain Government to allow them^eceive them and make them leave their nakhudhas in the time, of work and promise to give them documents to work at Bahrain while they knew that they were subjects of others and responsible for payments and * for necessary duty. Is not there a contempt ana insult to the rights of others? Should you think over and consiaer the matter you would find that the action of the Bahrain Goverment was inacunissible, and an encroachment on the rights of others. I am, therefore, informing you that I them to you. I am certain that you are of those just anc equitable persons who would observe the regulations and rules in force.

Broadcast regarding Shaikh of Kuwait*s intervention in the relations between Bahrain and Qatar•Personal. 16th October 1937* My dear de Gaury, It may interest you to know that on Wednesday night there was a broadcast from an Italian station at deri In Arabic to the effect that the Shaikh of Kuwait had succeeded in his task as arbitrator between the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Shaikh of Qatar and had arranged settlement between them* I should be very grateful if &gt;ou would endeavour to discover whether these stories about the internal disorders and external troubles in Bahrain originate in Kuwait* I have talked to Belgrave about it and we both consider it most unlikely that they have their origin in Bahrain* From the prominence which is given to the great virtues of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait, I am inclined to believe that they come from his own terri- toi^v« x talked to the Shaikh and he was rather annoyed as he considered it a piece of impertinence on the part of tnt: Shaikh oi Kuwait to wish to interfere and even to suggest tnat there was anything for him to interfere in in Bahrain, fte have no internal disorders of any sort at all and the minor labour troubles at the oil works are of no particular concern, but if these articles continue and these broad casts are made, I think it very probable that we shall have trouble at the oil works and I am very anxious to put a stop to them* it may interest you to know that the Shaikh wrote a letter by fi*M*S* Enterprise to the Shaikh of Kuwait and showed it to me before he sent it* There was no mention in/- G.S.H. de Gaury, M*C., Political Agent,in it of the receipt of any letter from Kuwait nor was there the slightest suggestion that Kuwait should come nere either as a friend or as a peacemaker. It seems tnat the Shaikh of Bahrain is inclined to believe that tne Shaikh of Kuwait is slightly unbalanced. You would have seen the demi-official letter which I wrote to Caroe about this question but I thought 2 should write to you a personal note as well. I am leaving here on the 27th by the Fast Mail ana hope to see you for half an hour or so on my way to Basrah where I presume I shall have the opportunity of meeting the Consul there with 'whom I have had considera ble correspondence# Yours sincerely.Oonfid ential — The Residency, Bushire, the 13th October, 1937, -p r\ &gt;Trs With ref^rerhce to your demi-official letter No*c/750-4/l3, dated the 9th October 1937, on the subject of the ownership of Zubarah, I am desired to say that both you and Weight man (should he so desire) will be able to discuss with Sir Trenchard Bowie after his return any doubts and difficulties you may feel in this matter* Captain T*Hickinbotham, Political Agent, Bahrai n*CONFIDENTIAL.

After Compliments:- I beg to inform you that Shaikh Abdulla bin Jasim al-Thani has taken off from us three lads, (who are not slaves), whose parents are living with us in our house. After armistice, he raided us and carried off 25 sheep (Erb), one she-eamel, and one donkey and all of their effects. He left nothing for them. The lads are 29, 26 and 16 years old. We request you to kindly make arrange ments for the lads to return to their parents. The effects were taken from one Abdulla bin Dalham al-Kuwari of Rafaa Jibli, Bahrain. Usual endingsConfidential.

Reference your memoraiidum Nod 1434/3.F. dated the 1st December 1937. position is that v.h n the Kairu surrendered to the Shaikh of Qatar, Shaikh Rashid, on behalf of his tribe, undertook to obey the laws of Qatar while he re sided in Qatar. It follows that, as Shaikh Rashid was personally infonried by my predecessor, if he has any complaint to make about ifce occurrences in Qatar he should complain to the Ruler of Qatar. It would only be possible for the Political Agent to interfere if a definite allegation were made that three men of the oaim Tribe had been enslaved by the Ruler of Qatar, and naturally an allegation of this sort necessari ly have to be supported by circumstantial evidence. 3. I regret, therefore, that on the facts so far before me I am not able to take the action requested.
