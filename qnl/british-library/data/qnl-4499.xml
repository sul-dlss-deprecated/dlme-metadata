Maj or. ? ■ Political Resident, in the Persianm Memorandum concerning 'the movements and business of Monsieur Michel Hatinoglou. V In May of this year, one Michel Hatinogl- -ou, a Levantine Greek, came to Bushire and in an interview with the Political Resident, informed him that a British firm known as 'The Sponge Exploration Syndicate Limited' had given him a roving commission to obtain for them a concession in Gulf waters for the exclusive right to fish for and take as their own property, sponges, pearls, corals and all under-sea produce suitable for commercial purposes. In answer to his request for the assistance of this Residency, Mons, Hatinog- -lou was informed that his Syndicate had better address His Majesty's Secretary of State on the subject. This course was eventually taken, with the result that the petitioners were given no encouragement to proceed with their scheme; they therefore changed their tactics and declared that their operations would be limited to sponges only. On the 16th.October, Mons. Hatinoglou left Bushire for Muscat. ^ On the 3th.November, His Majesty's Secretary of /■* State telegraphed to the Government of India that the Syndic- -ate had informed the Foreign Office that they had obtained a concession from the Persian Government of exclusive rights to fish for sponges from Pao to Gwadur, for a period of 50 years, and that they had instructed their representatives to proceed to Maskat and arrange with the several tribes for similar concessions along the Coast from Meebut up to and including the Bahrein Islands. Telegraphing on the 15th.November, ^to Foreign Depar- -tment. Major Cox observed that from the names disclosed as composing the Syndicate, it would seem to be only quasi- -British; that notwithstanding the paper stipulation operations would 1 limited to 'Sponges*, no invention.141 exists- which would enable a dredger 'bo gather 'the sponge while eschewing the pearl-oyster, and that, quite apart from the inherent objections to any such thing as a monopoly - 'being held 'by any Syndicate in Oulf Waters, it was doubtful if sponges existed in sufficient quantities to make a monop- -oly worthwhile; furthermore, that if we identified ourselves with a dangerous innovation by supporting this Syndicate, we should, in his opinion, not only alienate the Arab element and lay our motives open to general suspicion, but should also inaugurate a common scramble for the pearl fisheries of the Gulf. On the 22nd. instant. Major Grey telegraphed that Hatinoglou had left Maskat for Bunder Abbas, having obtained the written permission of the Sultan of Maskat for Sponge fishing for a period of 16 years, without a monopoly• Commenting upon this concession, in a telegram to the Government of India on the 24th. instant. Major Cox, a^ter observing that no special reservation regarding pearls or the pearl-banks, had been made, nor any safe-guard again- -st the employment of dredging or diving gear, asked for early/^ instruct ions from Government, as to whether (1) the Sulban of Maskat should be advised to cancel the document (i.e. the concession), which he had probably granted without fully considering its consequences; and, (2) whether other Sheikhs should ce warned against similar overtures. On the 25th. instant. Major Grey telegraphed that he was assured that Hatinoglou was going to the Pirate Coast. m&lt;\y ^• k (Copy). i&lt; FOIIL, c^. TELEGRAJvI.

The principle correspondents in the file are the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent in Bahrain, both posts being held by a number of incumbents throughout the period covered by the file.The file covers three periods:1. Correspondence from November to December 1905, relating to reports that a Levantine Greek named Michel Hatinglou is in the Gulf, seeking to arrange concessions with the region’s rulers for sponge fishing. A memorandum, undated and unsigned, reports that M. Hatinglou has signed a concession with the Persian Government to fish for sponges along the Persian coast between Fao [Al-Fāw] and Gwādar, and is seeking a similar concession in Muscat (folios 3-4). The correspondence also makes reference to the presence of a Russian consular agent in the Gulf (folio 5).2. Correspondence from May to August 1911 relating first to Gray Paul &amp; Company’s arrangement with Ullmann &amp; Co. of Hatton Garden to enter the pearl buying business in Bahrain, and to news that representatives of the French company Rosenthal &amp; Company, have been making enquiries into seeking concessions for pearl fishing in the Gulf. In a letter to the ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh ‘Īsá bin ‘Alī Āl Khalīfah, the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Zachariah Cox) warned that it would be disadvantageous to the Shaikh’s interests to grant any concessions to foreigners, and that the Political Agent should be consulted in all such matters (folios 10-11). In his reply to Cox’s letter, Shaikh ‘Īsá acceded to the request, while suggesting implicitly that neither would he consider concessions to British companies (Arabic on folio 15, printed English on folio 21).3. Correspondence from May to August 1917, relating first to reports that a Russian is on his way to Bahrain to purchase pearls on behalf of Moussaieff Brothers in Paris (folio 23), and second to reports that a company from the United States is seeking to take over the entire pearl buying business in the Gulf by offering prices of five to ten per cent above its competitors. In a letter dated 17 August 1917, the Political Agent in Bahrain reported to the Deputy Political Resident that the American company’s plan was to ship the finest pearls to the States, medium quality pearls to Europe, and the lowest quality pearls to India and the East (folio 24).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Pearl industry and trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002ed#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
