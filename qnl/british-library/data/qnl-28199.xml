(N.B.—This is an original message, sent by air mail to save telegraphic expense, but intended to be treated on receipt with the same expedition as if it had been telegraphed. It lias been drafted as if it were so despatched.) From Secretary of State To Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Repeated to Government of India, External Affairs Department and Dated 27th January,1940 Political Agent ,IC owe it. No. P.Z. 64/40. Kuwait Oil Company have stated in strict •onfidence that in the course of drilling evidence of sulphur deposits has been found sufficient to warrant further investigation with a view to commercial development. The American interests in the Company are thinking of seeking a concession from the Sheikh for the exploitation of the sulphur. Its existence has not yet been reported to His Highness as required under Article 15(A) of the Company’s agreeme.nt, but it is proposed that Rhoades, a Director of the Company, should take this step on his approaching visit to Koweit and endeavour to negotiate a concession. 2* In reply to an enquiry the Company have been informed that, although the Sheikh has no specific undertaking with His Majesty’s Government regarding sulphur, it would be in accordance with the general tenor of his agreements to seek our advice and approval before granting a concession, and that we should expect that he would do so. 3. The Company have been advised to ask Mr. Rhoades to keep the Political Agent informed of the course of the negotiations. They are specially anxious that nothing should be said to the Sheikh on the subject until it has been broached with him by Rhoades. You should therefore treat the information in paragraph 1 above as secret for the time being. But in the meantime I should be glad of your V preliminary/2. t* &gt; A preliminary views and those of the Government of India on the question of granting a concession for the production of sulphur in Koweit by the Kuweit Oil Company, or the American partners therein, if applied for. Question whether we should seek to prescribe any conditions (e.g. as to the disposal of the products) may also require consideration in due course* I should also be glad of your views and those of the Government of India as to whether when the Sheikh has been approached by Rhoades we should take steps to bring His Majesty’s Government’s attitude in the matter, as stated in paragraph 2, to the notice of His Highness at a convenient opportunity. 4. Subject to any views the Government of India may wish to express on this letter, and on the assumption that it should not be difficult to arrange that any sulphur produced is offered for marketing in India, it does not seem necessary to endeavour to negotiate a pre-emption agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company in respect of sulphur, as is generally done in respect of oil. It is understood that sulphur is a material of considerable importance, directly and indirectly, in the prosecution of the War; and as most of the supplies are drawn from foreign sources, at the cost of foreign exchange, it seems desirable that production within British or British-protected territories should be increased. It may be, therefore, that the Sheikh and the Company should be given encouragement towards the successful negotiation of a concession and the early exploitation of the mineral in question. The issue of the above has been duly authorised.Telegram W Q M . From. Political Resident, s.s. 'Nearchus'. To. Political Agent, Kuwait. No. T/122. Dated and received the 19th February, 1940.

He has also told Rhoades this I therefore do not think it necessary to inform him as contemplated in paragraph 2 of India Office No. P.Z.64 of January 27th. 3. The fact that Rhoades has come to Kuwait to negotiate on behalf of an American concern, should convey to the Shaikh an impression of the acquiescence of His Majesty* s Government. I think we should make sure that this is so for Shaikh is probably secretly pleased (in view of preponderance of local opinion of superiority of American Oil Companies over British) at arrival of an American and we should make it plain that this is only at His Majesty*s Government*s acquiescence, for Shaikh should not be allowed to think for a moment that His Majesty* s Government do not take a full interest in Kuwait. view ot slowing up of the Kuwait Oil Company s operations Shaikh proposes to demand speedy exploration which from what I have gathered from Rhoades the Gulf Company are not contemplating.

To Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bahrain. Subjects - Sulphur at Kuwait. Reference f In continuation of my telegram No. 0/57 of February 21st. 2. Rhoades has now submitted drafts of the Agreements he hopes to make with the Shaikh for the exploitation of sulphur in Kuwait. The first is an optional Agreement for a period of two years to be followed by a working agreement for a period of seventy five years. 3. The Agreements are drafted on the lines of the Kuwait Oil Company’s Agreements and the general clauses are identical. Points of interest now are: (a) The Company propose to pay the Shaikh fis. 50,000 on signature of the Option. In the working agreement (b) A total royalty of twelve annas a ton of sulphur mined.,is to be to the Shaikh. (c) There is no clause for minimum yearly payment, c.f. article 3 of Kuwait Oil Company’s Agreement. (d) Drilling programme is the same as the Kuwait Oil Company’s/ (Designation) S. 44. MFP—985 S&amp;P—(M-1597)—27 11-36—10.000.-2 Company's programme - c.f. article 2 of their Agreement. My comments are on (a) The Shaikh will probably demand a larger sum. (b) This sum is, I believe, very low. (c) Shaikh will probably suggest a figure and Rhoades does not expect draft to stand in this respect in its present form. (d) Number of feet to be drilled is the same as agreed upon for the Kuwait Oil Company but result will be roughly four times as many j?ells since sulphur is expected at 1,000 feet whereas the oil is at 4,000 feet. 4. I should be grateful if possible if I could be given some guide as to what sum Shaikh might reasonably be expected to be paid in respect of royalty. Political Agent, KuwaitfMrmiiiifm. Telegram. *S'.

The military authorities in India are greatly Interested in an adequate supply of sulphur being available and this is also essential for general trade requirements. No sulphur is produced in India, as supplies hitherto have been obtained mainly from Italy, Japan and the United States of America. It is understood there are also large deposits in Java. 2. In these circumstances we consider that the Sheikh of Kuwait should be advised to give every encouragement towards the successful development and exploitation of sulphur In his territories. 3. The Political Resident states that the British Interests in the Kuwait Oil Company are not interested in the exploitation of sulphur. In order to retain some control he suggests grant of concession to American Company registered in Canada, a solution which would probably commend Itself to American Interests, and on these terms we see advantage in the proposal, we have not yet received Prior’s final views on the subject of desirability of pre-emption agreement and we will telegraph further on this point when we receive them.4. Reference paragraph 2 of your Cxpresa letter, ve understand that Shaikh has already asked the Political Agent for adyice as regards acceptance of sulphur agroe/aent and i question of brlcFin// His Majesty's Governcaentf attituae to his notice has therefore been settled, 5. re ’ro'uld note, that the sulphur deposits in Kuwait, Judging by deposits already ’cnov/n in Kalat State, Afghanis* tan and Iran, *ould vciry likely prove to be of vary low grade, in which case there in little hope cf commercial development while suoplies of better Quality are available from elsewhere.

Resident to the Kov/eit Oil Concession and Political Agreement I enclose a copy of these documents. The draft sulphur concession is substantially the same, mutatis mutandis , as the oil concession, and there are a few points of a political or strategical colour (cf. the comments on Articles 5 (a), 8(B) and 9 in the Political Resident’s letter of 20th March) on which we would propose to ask the concessionaires to make an agreement with us, similar to the Political Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Oil Company. With these points we need not trouble you, but v/e should welcome any observations you may wish to make on the draft concession generally, and in particular we should be glad to be advised on the following points:- of four letters dated sulphur in Kov/eit. I now I now enclose for your infer and '20th March copy 2. As frequent references are made by the Political (a) R.C.Bryant, Esq Ministry of Supply, The Adelphi, John Adam Street W.C.2.&lt;§ (a) Article 3(A) of the Second Schedule: Is the Company’s obligation to drill thought adequate, or should the Sheikh he advised to press for a higher rate? (b) Article 3 of Second Schedule: Is the proposed royalty adequate (about ls5d per ton)? (c) Article 1: Is it desired that we should attempt to urge the Company to begin operations as soon as possible? (d) is it considered that His Majesty’s Government should endeavour to conclude a pre-emption agreement with the Company for the purpose of obtaining the sulphur produced by the Company if His Majesty’s Government should wish to do so 'in the event of a state of national emergency or war’’? Compare Article 11 and the Schedule of the Political Agreement relative to the Oil Concession, We have not yet received the Government of India's views on this point (cf. paragraph 4 of our express letter of the 27th January) but to save time we think it desirable to consult you forthwith. 3.

Subject to what follows there is no objection to ^ U*. tuji gr^nt concession on the lines proposed Government of India (letter dated March 27th) that Shaikh should be advised to give every encouragement towards the successful and early development and exploration of the sulphur in Kuwait. The Company’s representatives should be informed that His Majesty’s Government as well as the Shaikh are anxious that sulphur deposits should be investigated and exploited as soon as possible. They ^ think therefore that the Company should be pressed to reduce materially the option period of two years or at any rate to press on their investigations with a view to deciding as early as possible whether to take up the concession^and in modification of Article 2 (a)(i) of second schedule to undertake an obligation to drill four thousand feet in one year. If agreement is modified in these two respects His Majesty’s Government have no objection to grant concession on the understanding that the Company would be willing to enter into an agreement with His Majesty’s Government to cover such points as might be considered necessary in order to safeguard the latter’s interests such as the points (including pre-emption) covered by the political- 2 - political agreement relating to the Oil Concession mentioned in paragraph No. 5 of your Express letter V* A dated March 20th v No. C/268. 3. ^ith reference to comment in your Express Letter of March 20th bn Article 3 of second schedule it is difficult to advise. Demi-Official letter from Ministry of Supply states that American producers in TEXAS pay a state tax of two dollars hut that this is obviously more than could he expected in Kuwait and tentatively suggest that Shaikh might try for a higher rate than that in draft agreement say in the neighbourhood of two shillings six pence.

I have discussed matter with Rhoades who will undertake to reduce the option period to one and a half repeat one and a half years from date of signature. Rhoades explains that this is the very minimum in which he can obtain definite information as to the exploitadility of the sulphur deposit which is a twofold question (a) concentration of the deposits and (d) bringing sulphur to the surface, (a) is to be determined by drilling and (b) by installation of plant for the ’•Frash' process of extraction by hot water. In the present circumstances as it will be a problem to get any equipment on the ground within nine months Rhoades states that he cannot possibly make any further reduction.‘ 3. As for article 2 a (i) drilling obligation. Rhoades will now undertake to drill the first 4000 feet before the 3rd anniversary but cannot undertake to drill any given amount in any one year as drilling is only one factor in the campaign. The programme now suggested seems to me should meet His Majesty’s Government’s purpose for it will serve no useful purpose to push on with drilling unless necessary plant under (b) is also in operation and Rhoades will want to drill 2000 - 3000 feet in his initial investigations the results of which if satisfactory will leave him with the balance to drill under the second schedule. This will mean that extraction of sulphui will continue at the same rate which Rhoades states cannot be increased without duplication of equipment which cannot be justified until results are known and also no margin would be left in case of emergencies such as breakdown. 4. Rhoades will be willing to enter into agreement with- 2 - © * sb-'* with His Majesty’s Government as mentioned in the India Office telegram No. 2021 and heyond obvious necessary modi fications e.g. article 2 wishes to discuss article 3.

SCOTT 23-1 2-JjjO. FOR KUWAIT OIL COMPANY,LIMITEDKUWAIT, D.o /13 ARABIA . U ^ 3rd February, 19M My dear Galloway, I enclose herewith Sass* report in connection with the sulphur at Burgan, from which it may be seen that though the surface phenomena may be considered to indicate favourable conditions ^or the occurrence of sulphur, its existence can not be predicted from this source. The discoveiy was made fortuitously from the well samples and I believe I am right in saying that most of the discoveries made in the U.S.A* have occurred in a similar manner. Whilst traces of sulphur have occurred in all our wells, those in No,2 and No,6 wells have been very meagre and, as Sass mentions &gt; it not been possible to correlate them from one well to another, thus little can be deduced at the present time, as to the extent of the&gt;deposits. Since these lie in porous and fissured water-logged limestone, they could not be mined and are only producable by the Frasch process. Yours sincerely Major A.C.Galloway, 0•B,B•, Political Agent KUWAITi.iagwa, Kuwait, January 31st, 1941 # Mr* L, D* Scott KUWAIT Below, at your request, I have very briefly summarized for the Government of India the information re sulfur that the Kuwait Gil Company Ltd* has incidentally noted while searching for oil in Kuwait State* Kuwait State is entirely covered with a thick series of gatchy sands and gravels which completely blanket all older geologic formations* Therefore surface evidences as to what might be found re sulfur at depth are entirely limited to evidences of hydrogen sulfide gas* Emanations of this gas are well known in the vicinity of Madaniyat, and result in effloresences of sulfur on occasional gatchy surface rocks in the area* Rocks with similar effloresences are found in the Burgan Hills and perhaps elsewhere in the State* Finally, at Ain al Abd in the Neutral Zone just south of Kuwait State, there are large springs of sulfur water (water with hydrogen sulfide) which rise to the surface and flow down to the Persian Gulf* In addition to these evidences of hydrogen sulfide gas, the Kuwait Oil Company has obtained direct information re sulfur itself from study of the 'ditch samples' which we collect as regular routine at five-foot intervals during the drilling of our oil wells. Tiny bits of bright yellow crystalline sulfur have shown up in these ditch samples in small percentages along with other rocks in all six of our wells drilled to date south of Kuwait Bay in the Burgan area* These occurrences are mostly limited to the uppermost 1500 feet of stratigraphic section, which interval is dominantly Eocene limestone cut horizontally thru the middle by a bed of anhydrite 300 feet thick* These limestones occasionally carry some bitumen, and in the Burgan areathey invariably carry large quantities of very salty sulfur water* The individual horizons in which sulfur has been logged as prominent from the ditch samples are some 15 to 80 feet thick* (By 'prominent' we mean that sulfur has been logged as constituting some 5 to 20 percant by volume of the entire horizon*) Our very richest 'show' to date&gt; % 2 •“ suggests that at a depth of about 1000 feet in one of our wells we penetrated an 80 foot horizon which might average some 70/i soluble carbonate, some 20/£ sulfur, and some 10 a /» shale and bitumen* All of the 'shows” in our other wells are of a smaller nature - thinner, and probably not so rich* These other wells average about 40 feet of horizons in which sulfur has been noted as 'prominent' - and here again 'prominent' goes down to as low as five percent* Our oil wells have been exploratory - have been spaced at about 1^- mile intervals - and across this distance we have not had much luck in correlating sulfur shows between wells* To sum up* We have limestone, anhydrite, hydrogen sulfide, and bitumen, all in close association in our uppermost 1500 feet of stratigraphic section. If we could substitute the text books* 'gypsum' for our 'anhydrite', then we could say that we have in close association all four of the principal components generally considered necessary for the formation of native sulfur in sedimentary beds, - and to prove the point, we actually have some native sulfur - at least in thin beds and in minor percentages*D.O.No.C/86 3rd Fetormry, 1Q41 dear Scott, ^ O O- V ^any tdanks for your letter No. 13 of the 3rd February.

Hhoadea said he did not propose to use Dickson as an interpreter when discussing the Neutral 5one because (a) he was a servant of the Kuwait Oil Company, (b) ns would find difficulty in translating technical terms, and (c) for reasons which he did not clearly specify. I imagine that Abdulla Mulla will prove more pliable than Dickson and that i&amp;oades* decision to bide his time before approaching the Shaikh is to enable him to pave the way gently and not as he would have me believe because he did not wish to shock His Highness, whose health he under stood was not as satisfactory as it might be, by too abrupt an approach. That model of rectitude and righteousness, Asttref, the guide, philosopher, and friend of Uajor ^rank Hblmes interpreted during the Sulphur Concession negotiations/!^ Tours sincerely, 91. T.

They paid a courtesy call an His Highness on the same day and later called at the Agency. Ho 'business was discussed with His Highness or with the Political Agent. itr, Hhoades stated that he had come to Kuwait for two purposes ahich were (a) to approach the Shaikh with regard to acquiring his rights in the Neutral isone, and (b) to prepare for certain preliminary operations in connection with the Eastern Gulf Oil Company limited # s Sulphur Concession. itn regard to the Neutral *one !r. Bhoades expressed surprise that the Shaikh had obtained such early information of the puroo&amp;e of his visit. He would undoubtedly have been inierestea to ‘earn the source of Kis Highness* information but care *as taken not to satisfy his not unnatural curiosity. Hr* ihoades stated that he had been informed of the Shaikh’s attitude by the India Office when he was in T.onion, but that the instructions he had received from his principals vere clear and he had no option but to make an approach to His Highness. T informed Hr. Bhoades that Eis Highness had made it plain to me that he was not prepared to discuss this question with him or with mny other individual at the present time. Hr. Hhoades said he quite realised the position but he mast carry out his instructions. If however the Shaikh informed hira that he would not discuss the matter then there would be no more to ;e r , i for the time being. He does not propose to raise the question with His Highness for three or four weeks. * 3. Mr. Bhoades indicated that his Company (the Eastern Gulf Cil Company limited) had had preliminary discussions vlth tjhe California Arabia standard Oil Company, who have already ac aired- 2 - Ilan baud’s rlrfita In the Neutral 3one f and that there was reason to believe that in the event or these negotiations with His Highness being successfully concluded the two companies would 1 m able to conclude a actually satisfactory agreement for the development of the area. 4. Mr. .thoades stated that he would Keep Mr. G.N. JacKson (who will act as Political igent when T am in India) fully informed of the progress of the negotiations and that he proposed to utilise the services of Afcdulla Mulla &lt;?alah, His Highness* Secretary, as interpreter Mien he discussed matters with the 3haUch, 4 : ti; regard to the Sulphur Concession [r* diorvies stated that It had been indicated to the Eastern Gulf Oil Company Limited by the appropriate Department of the United states Government that personnel and equipment not required by the Defence Services could be made available for the preliininary investigation which was necessary to determine accurately if the Kuwait sulphur deposits were sufficiently concentrated to maice development on a commercial scale practicable. Tf the result of this investigation «*as satisfactory then rr. Bhoades understood that material for the inmediate development of the field and the erection of the necessary refinery would be made available from the United States. (He anticipated that within two years production would be 2. Hr. Bhoades proposes to examine the equipment remaining here belonging to the Kuwait Oil Company Limited and to draw up lists of further equipment that will have to be sent from Am.rioa for td. preliminary work and be expaota that this will talc, him three or four weeks. He will then return to the United States after visiting the California Arabia Stanlard installation at Dharan and th* Oil Company^ at Abadan. 3.

He considered that the work: would take from four to five months and that some six to ten drillers etc, presumably from the United Stntes, would be employed. 4. I understood from Hr. .Rhoades that the production of sulphur /as very neoessary for war purposes especially in this part of the world and it was for this reason that the neoessary equipment would be made available. 5.

His Highness has approached me on behalf of Abdulla Mubarak for shipping space from Bombay for the latter’s car, which has been lying there since \pril. Abdulla Mubarak does not like to risk shipping it by dhow. 5 • Abdulla Mubarak is not without a car; but Fahad As Salim has just returned from Egypt with four good ones - including a Buiok like mine - and has rather put his nose out of Joint. 4. It is this sort of thing, plus our seeming inability or unwillingness to ship a car for His Highness' right hand man, coming with the news that Irac* ins Just got 200 new lorries, and Ibn Sands* regular acquisitions, that gives His Highness a chance to pose - quite insincerely - as a Cinderella.5.

The Political Agent, Kuwait. p !?&gt; A . To. The Secretary to the Hon’hie the Political Hesident in thePersian Gulf., Pushire. Sir, I have the honour to say that the Eastern Gulf Oil Company, who have a number of American employees working here, have requested that they he allowed to send both their Company’s ■business correspondence and also the private correspondence and parcels of their employees to America through the United States Army postal facilities of the Persian Gulf Service Command. 2. They wish to he permitted to deliver their own mail to the United States Array Station in Basra ir their company lorry; their mail would he stamped with United States stamps and would he despatched to America hy the United States Army more ex peditiously than hy the Indian Post Office. 5. The Company have already been advised hy an officer of the Persian Gulf Service Command that United States Army postal facilities will he granted to them, subject to the concurrence of the Government of India. 4. The Company have undertaken to surrender incoming parcels from the United States for the inspection of the Kuwait Customs, and arrangements could he made to ensure that goods are not exported hy this means in contravention of the Kuwait Government’s regulations effecting export. Similar arrangements could he made to ensure that outgoing mails were censored here before despatch to Basra, and that incoming mails arriving from Basra were sent here for censorship before delivery. Such arrangements, now ever, would necessarily depend on the good faith of the Company and of the United States .Army officials in Basra. 5. As far as my records here show, the Post and Telegraphs Department of the Government of India have not secured amonopoly of postal services in Kuwait and there would appear to he no legal objection on this score, 6. It is for consideration, however, whether the proposed privilege, if grant©! in its entirety may not later he used to support American claims to establish their own systems oCommunica tions in Kuwait and possibly throughout the Persian Gulf; and it might be wise to concede the privilege for the duration of the war only, and subject to the Company observing sincerely such conditions as may be imposed locally in connection with customs, control of exports, and censorship, 7, Alternatively, it might be advisable to require the Company to post their mails anti that of their employees in closed covers through the Indian Post Office here, addressed to the United States Army Authorities in B«sra. The outer covers would be stamped with Indian stamps for local mail to Iraq, anti the contents could be stamped, either here or in Basra, with United States stamps. Such a system would obviate the necessity of making any special arrangements or of relying on the good faith of tne Company in respect of Customs, export control, and cemsorsnip; and would not permit of tne inauguration of a postal system in competition with the existing one. ?Jails are despatched to Basra from the Kuwait Post Office twice weekly, whereas the Company only contemplate send ing their lorry once a week to Basra. The Company could not,there fore, reasonably complain of delays between Kuwait and Basra. 8. This latter arrangement would involve a slight deviation from the Indian Post Offices* rules regarding the despatch of covers within an outer cover; also, whatever arrangements are made here for this Company, it will, of course, be necessary for them to reach agreement with the Iraq Postal and Censorship Authorities as well.

No - ' :: ... ; ^ ' J / 2. Your telegram No, 27824 dated 7th December. Shaikh’s statement that he had been unsuccessful in obtaining motor vehicle equipment now asked for from Gulf Oil Company, from political authorities and Government cf India is not correct. Since 1941 when motor vehicle supply question began to become difficult Kuwait requirements have been largely met. In those cases in which they have not been met this has been due to (a) requirements not having been essential (b) purchasers or their agents changing their minds over vehicles required leading to lapse of export permits and difficulties of approaching United States lease lend authorities for extra vehicles, and (c) the cumbersome and often contradictory regulations in India. 3. Shaikh has recently applied for permission to export from India following vehicles three l£ ton lorries one 5 ton lorry two 3 ton lorries fitted as water trucks and two other 3 ton lorries for himself, state administrative purposes and Kuwait-Subair Transport Company. I am recommending to Government of India that export of all these vehicles be allowed. In addition car belonging to Shaikh Abdullah Mubarak, (Huler’s right hani man) has been lying in Bombay for want of shipping space since April. 4 ' Shaikh did approach Political Agent, Kuwait new saloon car but he was unable to help him as only U' 1 * hanu cars can be exported from India. Political Agent \Kuwait, states that Shaikh does not need another car as he already has two 1942 saloons deterioratinr from lack of use, in this matter and is obviously puttinf as many irons in fire as possible, he has real grievance when Kuwait ration of new cars and lorries is compared with generous allotment granted Iraq and Saudi Arabia by r.K.S.C. It is moreover obviously undesirable that Gulf Oil Company should supply vehicles. In order not to compromise Patrick I suggest Gulf OilCompany reply they cannot assist and at same time suggest he approaches Political Agent for his requirements. If Shaikh ollows this advice I do not anticipate he v/ill add more than one or two vehicles to those he has already asked us for (c.f.paragraph 3 above). In any case Government of India should endeavour to supply all vehicles at earliest possible date. two Packard saloons (1939) and two older touring cars.

In his memorandum No. BPC/177 dated the 24th April, 1943, the Deputy Controller, Iraq Censorship, to the Assistant Director ( Middle East ) Censorships, a copy of which was sent to tills Residency, the former intimated that he had been informed by the United Statens Base Censor that in order to expedite confi dential official and staff mail of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company the United States Military Authorities had agreed to allow these firms to use the United States Army Postal Service. The Deputy Controller added that on the assurance of the United States Censorship that this mail would be subjected to 100&gt; Censorship no objection was being raised by the Iraq Censorship. * No communication was made by the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the two companies authorising the transmission of staff mail by this channel, originally authorised for company mail only, but since then such mail has been forwarded through the United States Array authorities, at first through the United States Army B^se Post Office at Basra, and more recently, through that opened at Bahrain. The mail is stamped with United States stamps obtained from the United States Army post office at internal United States postage rates. 3. Copy is forwarded of letter No. C/1520 dated S. 6.

C/1677 dated 5th November, 1£44, from the Political Agent, Bahrain, and of their enclosures, relating to certain questions arising fron the transmission of this mail* The position is most irregular but we cannot make Americans pay for a service they do not use, and it is net anticipated that the loss in revenue to the Indian Postal administration will be considerable* A limitation of one pound might, however, be imposed on all parcels sent through United States Military Authorities. I understand most of the parcels sent contain souvenirs for relatives in the iJtates and the imposition of this limitation while preventing the export of prohibited articles except in negligible quantities woulo. still allow such souvenirs to be sent. The Eastern Gulf Oil Company, who have a number of American employees at Kuwait, have now applied to the Political itgent, Kuwait, for similar facilities in respect of their office and staff mail. As similar considerstions apply, and we cannot deny to this company the facilities accorded to the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Arabian American Oil Company, I have instructed the Political Agent, Kuwait, that the facilities requested can be accorded subject to the following provisos! (&amp;) that it wHl cease when mail services are restored to normal. (b) that parcels arc to be limited to one pound in weight, and (c) tnat the .&lt;iall should be posted from Kuwait to Br,sra in ah outer cover or bag through the Kuwait post office. (d) that any local cenaorsnip rules in force should be complied with. (c) will ensure that the Indian Post Office at Kuwait loses no revenue, and we are in a position at Kuwait to insist on this proviso as, unlike at Bahrain, there is no United States Army Post Office at Kuwait. 5. I should be grateful lor a rajly by telegram on the suggestion made in paragraph 3 above for the limitation on weight of parcels. 3d/- GKOFPH&amp;Y PRIOR Political Resident, Persian Gulf ATTEST ED for Secretary to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf.CONFIDEMTIAL No. C/1520 Political Agency, Bahrain, 29th October, 1944 From. The Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my predecessor's letter No. C/484 dated ^pril 7th 1943, and to enclose a copy of a letter addressed to me by the Chief Local Representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company on the subject of the carriage of mails to and from America. 2. The time taken for a letter to reach the U.S.A. by American Army Post is a matter of days while the time taken through the Government of India Post Office is a matter of weeks if not months. I consider it would be very unwise to insist on all letters passing through the Bahrain Post Office f'ng the delay in receiving letters would have a very serious effect on the morale of txhe American workmen in particular those employed on the hundred octane plant construction. It is of course impossible to estimate the loss in revenue caused to the Posl 5 Office but it cannot be very consider-/?^ 1 ' and therefore I suggest that the present procedure with regard to letters be permitted to continue until the termination of hhstilities. 3. I can see no satisfactory reason why large packages should be sent by air mail and propose to inform the Chief Local Representative that whatever space may be available a slight limitation of one pound must be strictly imposed. This will allow for the sending of souvenirs to relatives in the States and will effectively prevent the export of prohibited articles except in negligible quantities. 4. The last paragraph of the Chief Local Representative' letter under reference raises two points. Firstly the question of censorship of letters and packets and' secondly the customs examination of packets. I have discussed the question of customs examination with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the Chief Local Representative at my suggestion raised the question with the Director of Customs with the result stated in his letter. I suggest that if the Bahrain Government are satisfied that there is no need for us to take exception to the present procedure, as regards the question of censorship I feel that the letters which travel through American Army channels are adequately censored and that there Is no need to insist on a further examination here, in fact it would not be advisable From a political point of view. I advise that the whole procedure now in forcebe permitted to continue except that air postal packets should have a weight limitation imposted of one pound.

The service is of great value to both the company and our American employees and we naturally hope it will continue to be available to us until regular airmail service has become re-established. Our A.P.O. mail is dispatched in Company launches to Mr. Rodstrom in Manama and by him is turned over directly to the Army Post Office at Muharraq. As the Bahrain Post Office is in no way involved in the handling or transmission of the mail we assume that there is no objection on the part of the Bahrain Government to the practice which we are following and that there is no appreciable loss in revenue involved. However, we feel that we should acquaint you fully of what we are doing. Because of various complications involved, we have not undertaken to handle outgoing parcels post packages for our employees via the A.P.O service. We may do so later ±;£ but if so we will be pleased to advise you to that effect. If there is any objection to the transmission of A.P.O mail through Bahrain as described above or if there any are any points on which you desire more complete information, will you kindly let us know. Yours very truly, ARABIAN AMERICAN OIL COMPANY 3D/- Manager of RelationsCONFIDENTIAL 'i/yfa British Residency &amp; Consulate General, Bushire, the 29th January, 1945. The Political Agent, KIT.YAIT.

It would appear therefore that the Sheikh has been duplicating /his F.C,Starling, Esq., Ministry of Fuel 1, Millbank, and Power, S.W. 1.his enquiries. His Majesty's Government would prefer to see all the vehicles supplied through the Government of India, which is the normal procedure in respect of Koweit.

Dated Bahrain, the 24th September, 1945. Reference correspondence ending with my Printed Letter No. C/879, dated the 15th September, 1945, regarding the United States Army Post Office facilities for American employees of Bapco and Araraco. Anderson spoke to me today on this subject and said that he thought A.P.O. facilities would be no longer available for his employees in this area after another month or so; and that he considered equivalent facilities were essential in order to avoid discontent amongst Bapco employees - an opinion with which I generally agree. He asked me to do what I could to obtain such facilities. He added that the only alternative to A.P.O. at the moment was to send letters to the United States of America via Lagos and test letters had established that they took about two weeks, or so, to reach the United States. Since letters sent from here to England and vice versa take only 4 or 5 days, he thought that to send letters to the United States via England would be the quickest route. 2# I should be grateful if the Government of India could be asked to arrange through the Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department for the expeditious carriage of mails from here to the United States and if I could be informed whether this can be done. 3- I also gathered from Anderson, and in respect of the return service it would seem obvious, that the coToperatlon of the American Postal Authorities would also be required. Perhaps the Government of India could also be asked to invite such co-operation. Sd/- C.J. Pelly Political Agent, BahrainA EM * s felegram ’Cypher 1 From India Office, London. To. Foreign New Delhi.
