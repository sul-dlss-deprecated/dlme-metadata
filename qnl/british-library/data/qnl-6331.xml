My dear Colonel, I don't know whether you will have reached Bushire by the tine this gets there and I don't know what your plans are Dor investing the Sheikh with the K.C.I.E. But, it I may suggest it, and it is possible, I think we ought to make rather a big Function oD it. The Turks investing him the other day with the Medjidie had a big gathering and the whole town witnessed it; there was only a ragged salute From the Sheikh's own battery, but a lot oF speech- -iFying with expressions oF cordiality, etc. Also the Sheikh was up river last year when Sheikh Khazal was invested and I Fancy rather expects a similar Function with much Firing oF salutes etc. IF you could give me a mail or two's notice and bring a Navy ship or two with you we could make quite a good show by Formal invi-tations to the local celebrities, wearing oF uniForms, heavy sa- -luting etc. The Sheikh was very pleased with the honour and the bigger Function we can make oF the inves- -titure the more it will impress the Arabs, not to mention the Turks in Basra.

Whereas We, taking into Our Royal consideration that there do not exist adequate means whereby We can reward important and useful services rendered to Us in Our Indian Empire in the advancement of the public interests of Our said Empire, and taking also into consideration the expediency of distinguish ing such services by some mark of Our Royal favour : Now for the purpose of attaining an end so desirable as that of thus distinguishing such services aforesaid, We have instituted and created, and by these presents for Us, Our Heirs and Successors, do institute and create a new Decoration—to be designated as hereinafter described,—and we are graciously pleased to make, ordain, and establish the following Rules and Ordinances for the Government of the same which shall from henceforth be inviolably observed and kept.

Eighthly. —It is ordained that if any one, after having received either of the Medals, again renders such service as, if he had not received such Medal, would have entitled him to it, such further service shall be recorded by a bar attached to the ribbon by which the Medal is suspended ; and for every such additional service an additional bar may be added. Ninthly. —In order to make such additional provisions as shall effectually preserve pure this honourable Decoration, it is ordained that if any person on whom the Medal of the Eirst Class is conferred be guilty of any crime or disgraceful conduct which in Our judgment disqualifies him for the same, his name shall, by an especial Warrant under Our Sign Manual, to be countersigned by one of Our Principal Secretaries of State, be forthwith erased from the list of those upon whom the said Decoration shall have been conferred, and his Medal forfeited and returned to Us, Our Heirs and Successors; and in the case of those who have been awarded Medals of the Second Class, such erasure of their names from the lists of those upon whom the said Decoration shall have been conferred and forfeiture of their Medals shall be effected under theForeign Office Press—No. 57—16-9-12—168. 2 2 ^ Order of Our Governor-General of India for the time being, to whom their Medals shall he returned.

To, The Officiating Civil Commissioner, B a g h jX a^yl. Memorand um» Reference, the last paragraph of my telegram No&gt; dated March 12th. 1918, recommending Khan Sahib Mullah Abdallah ibn Abdulillah, Arabic writer in this office^for a suitable reward for his services in con nexion with the settlement of the Blockade arid Ajman questions. 2 a h.E. Shaikh Salim is a somewhat difficult and distrustful character and during negociations which lasted for nearly two months I more than once despaired of overcoming his obstinacy. Throughout that period the Mullah was indefatigable in his quiet way in endea vouring to persuade His Excellency oi the fact that his A&gt; and our interests being indentical^ it was impei^tive that he should place entire confidence in us and assist us unquestioningly in all our undertakings. - w ie Shui^n and many of the principal people in Koweit have a great respect for and confidence in the Mullah, who like his father^is one of the religious leaders of the community. He has been for 17 years in our service and has thrown his influence whole-heartedly on to our side. this -act has been testified to by all my predecessors and was recognized by Government in the grant o. the title oi Khan Sahib some three years ago. 3 , Mullah Abdallah accompanied me on my recent iourney through Central Arabia and made himself extreme ly useful. I found he_was every where well-known and respected and his presence contributed greatly to the- 2 - the excellent reception which we met with in all the towns At Kiyadfc, especially, though himself no Wahabi, he was at once popular. He is a persona grata with Bin Baud, who liked him to attend our nightly interviews, and who loaded him with presents and flattering speeches at his departure. 4 , The Mullah’s pay is only Ks,150/- per mensem after 17 years service and from what I have said it will be understood that such a salary is absolutely inadequate for a man of such parts and a title-holder in the Empire. It is my opinion that his salary should be raised to Rs.300/- p.m. at the least and that, as a special reward for the services I now bring to light, he should be promoted to a further honour and granted an honorarium of Rs. 1000/-. Such a reward will have an encouraging effect t upon our friends here and w#ll enable us to attract other Arabs of character and standing to service under the British Government.

Khan Sahib Nulla Saleh bin Muhammad exerts a great deal of personal Influence on H.E.Shaikh Salim and I consider that it is in a large way due to this influence that the latter has im proved so much of late. For this and other miscellaneous assist ance I recommend him for the honour of Kh h Bahadur. ’Abdul Latlf bin ’Abdul Jalil,Director of Cu toms,gave me a great deal of assistance luring the blockade and continues to do so. He has given various Government depar .ments much help in arranging for booms and labour,supplies me with figures for trade statistics and willingly gives any assistance asked of him. E consider that he deserves the award of an honour and I there fore recommend him for Khan Sahib. Hamad (bin ’Abdul ’Azinas Sumait,Desert Officer,was attached to me as representative of H.E.Shaikh Salim during the blockade and gave me very great assistance. He is a connection by marriage of the Shaikh,has a small business of his own and is not very well-to-do. During the blockade and due to his having to re main with me most of the day his business suffered a good deal.

Recommendations for the grant of the titles of Maharajadhiraja, Maharaja Bahadur, Maharaja, Maharani, Nawab Bahadur, Nawab, Begum, Raja Bahadur, Raja and Ram should invariably be submitted separately, with a full statement of the grounds on which each recom mendation is made; they should not be included in the general list of recommendations tor the grant of Indian titles. As these high titles are given very sparingly for exceptionally meritorious service and only to persons of good family who are in a position suitably to main tain them, the following qualifications are regarded as essential (a) the possession of considerable landed property; (5) unimpeachable fidelity to Government; (c) respectable private character. 5 As a rule recommendations should ordinarily be made in the first instance for the lower titles of Sardar Sahib, Khan Sahib, Rai Sahib and Rao Sahib • but in cases of unusual services, or where the lower title would be inappropriate on account of the rank or status of the recipient, recommendations may be made for the grant of the higher titles of Diwan Bahadur, Sardar Bahadur, Khan Bahadur, Rai Bahadur and Rao Bahadur, in the first instance : such recommendations should, however, invariably be accompanied with an explanation of the reasons why the lower title is considered inadequate. In the event of a recipient of a lower title being recommended for a higher title, the date on which the lower title was granted should always he stated. 6. The title of Sardar Bahadur is regularly conferred on members of the Order of British India 1st Class, and particular care should therefore be exercised in the selection of individuals to be recommended for this honour. 7. The statements which accompany the recommendations should invariably be type written or printed, and the entries in them should be arranged in order of priority and serially numbered, it being borne in mind that when eliminations have to be made the order is usually taken as a guide.

It is essential also that the names, titles and designations of the persons recommended, and, in the ease of officials’, the branch of the service to which they belong and the offices which they hold, if these are to be gazetted, should be stated in the exact form in which they are intended to appear in the Gazette of India, and in the sanads which are granted to the title- holders. 9. A specific title should always be proposed, and the Province or State of which the person recommended is a native should be mentioned. 10. There is ordinarily no objection to the renewal of previous recommendations, and it should be borne in mind that previous recommendations are not considered unless expressly renewed. In the event of the renewal of a previous recommendation the date on which such a recommendation was made should always be given. Cf Foreign and 11.

Some time ago I .ayself had the pleasure of again bringing his good services to the notice of the Govern ment mad I am therefore doubly hap^y to have the honour of presenting him with the Sanad and Badge of his new order. I will now proceed to decorate him. To Mulla. I wish you every success in the future and hope you will ce the recipient of further favours. I have also very great pleasure in bestowing on another of our friends,Abdul I*atif bin Abdul Jalil,the first marie of recognition of his .ervioes to my Government, prede cessors of mine have left notes in my office regarding his good services to them. These together with the very gre vt help he has given to me ever since I arrived here two years ago, were brought to the nomice of the Government by me some time ago and in recognition thereof His Excellency the Viceroy of India has been pleased to confer on him mh€ * title of Khan °ahib. I have now very great pleasure in presenting him with the Smaad and decorating him with the Badge of the Order. To Abdul Latif. I wish you every success in th' future.

The wor* of Uiese aen is not haown to all, but only to the leaders of those countries who appreciate the good wor^-c of these good nen. Both Mulls Saleh and Abdul Latif have served their country very well. Our A-nlr, FhaiKh Salim al Mubarak as Sabah, who re pects the right of others (and he h ,3 shown his ability in judging others with justice) appreciates the services rendered by tnese men to their country. Likewise the men of Great Britain,who have been given charge of the Political Agency in Kuwait, have appreciated the work of these men, and have recommended them to their chiefs ior the grant of these respected titles. In the middle of the year 1919, His Majesty the King of Great Britain and Emperor of India ordered the award of the title Khan Bo-hadur' to be preoented to Mulla Saleh, and the title of 'Khan Sahib' to Aodul hatif bin Abdul Jalil. I, thereiore, in the name of my fellow country men and myself present our greatest and best thanks to His Majesty,King George V; and after that, to our Amir, Shaikh Salim al Mubarak as Sabah; and to all the men of Great Britain who have recommended these titles, and especially H.B.M’s Consul at Kuwait, Captain McCollum, as these two titles have been presented in his time.

Foreign and political Department, Simla, the 14th October 1920. Dear Trevor, It has been represented to the government of India that the liberal distribution of Indian titles which has been taken place of recent years, especially a^ong low-paid officials in clerical employment, is likely to depreciate the value of these rewards, and it has been suggested that measures should be taken to counteract that process* It is true that for special reasons Indian titles, particulaj -ly those of Rai Sahib, Rao Sahib and Khan sahib have been grant ed with unusual freedom in recent years and that a number of low- paid clerks have shared in this liberal distribution. The Govern ment of India recognise the danger of depreciation which has been pointed out to them, and consider that, in order to safe guard the prestige attached to the possession of these titles, it is desirable to limit their distribution to persons of a certain social standard and to reward the services of persons below that standard in some other way. it has accordingly been decided that, in future, recommendations for the titles of Rai Sahib, Rao Sahib and Ahan Khan Sahib on behalf of persons en gaged in purely clerical appointments drawing less than 250/- a month will not, except in very special circumstances, be con sidered. I am to request that this principle may be borne in mind in submitting lists of recommendations for Indian titles.
