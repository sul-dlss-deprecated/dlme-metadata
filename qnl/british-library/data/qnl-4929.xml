V From To Msgor T# Hlckinbotham, GkB.E,, Political Agent &amp; Consul, Muscat* The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* Subject i- tfasc^ §UC9^8Slaat ft / I 4 Sir, I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ^ )b ending with your telegram No» 707 dated October 11th, 1940. 2* At an interview with the Sultan on the 14th of October I discussed with him the question of his successor. His Highness was inclined to treat the question in a rather im personal way due no doubt to the fact that at present he has no male heir and has no particular affection for amy single member of his family* The Sultan considered that in the interests of both His Majesty^ Government and the State his successor should hold the same views as his own with regard to the Stated close connection with His Majesty's Government^ and should be personally acceptable to the majority of the people. In his opinion it would be necessary to consider the claims of his uncles Saiyid Nadir bin Faisal, Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal, Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, who is at present Minister for External Affairs, and his half brother Tarik bin Taimur. He did not think that any of his other relatives were worthy of consideration nor would they, in his opinion, put forward any claim • I asked if his eldest half brother, Saiyid Majid bin Taimur would have any claim / but while (H 5«) Ibut while not directly answering my question in the negative the Sultan said that he would never suggest that Saiyid Majid should succeed Mm as he considered Saiyid Ifajid most unsuitable. In regard to the four persons whom he had named the Sultan said that unfortunately not one of them fulfilled the two conditions that he had suggested should be fulfilled by his successor* His uncle Saiyid Nadir had&gt; he consideredi lost his influence with the people and was incapable of taking part in affairs of State owing to his indifferent health. His uncle Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal would be a very bad choice as although, owing to his pleasant manners f he was liked by persons who had no close acquaintance with hinii he was unreliable | avaricious t intriguing and was not stable in his political outlook, at times professing to be pro-British and at others unoloubtedly the reverse Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur had not outgrown his early upbringing, he was at school in Turkey and Germany, and . this was in the Sultan*s view a sufficient reason to disqualify him from further consideration* Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, His Highness^ junior uncle and full brother of His Highness*s father Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal, was definitely pro-British and thus fulfilled one of the conditions but^ said the Sultan he was unpopular with the people. His unpopularity was due to his quick temper and consequent harsh acts which provoked resentment # but in spite of this disadvantage Saiyid Shahab was in the Sultan's opinion the most suitable person to succeed him. His Highness gave me the impression that though Saiyid Shahab was by no means an ideal choice he was the best that could be made in the circumstance. The Sultan pointed out that in addition to his pronounced pro-British feelings Saiyid Shahab would , as the principal minister of State, be in a position to establish himself immediately in the event of his, the Sultan* s| sudden demise as he would be in control and would be able to use his authority to ensure that hie rivals were not / in a positionin a position to offer any serious opposition* During the course of the interview the Sultan never once suggested that any recognition private or public should be accorded to Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal as his successor by His Majesty's Government and I do not consider that any such recog nition would at the present time be in accordance with the Ruler*8 own wishes* At the end of our discussion on this subject His High ness mentioned that he had recently received letters from Dhofar and that in consequence of the news contained in them he might possibly wish to make a further statement on this subject in the near future* The Sultan visited his southern province in April of this year and has a wife living there* 3* The future is doubtful) the Sultan may have a son $ an event which will probably change his whole outlook^ or in the course of two or three years Saiyid Tarik bin Taimur may develop into an ideal successor, but for the time being I consider that Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal is the most suitable choice and should be looked upon as the future Sultan* The history of Muscat shows that during the last hand- normal procedure has been for the ruling Sultan to successor before his own death* Sometimes the his preference for a particular son or relative and sometimes he has made a pronouncement but in history of the country there are many instances and intentions of the ruler being disregarded More often than not in the past it has been powerful relative who has succeeded in establishing is what will probably happen in the future* the procedure remains much the same as it has there has been a change In the source from which draws his strength. In the old days a claimant large following in the country and exerted the / most thismost influence over the tribes of Oman was generally able to establish himself and hold his position as Sultan until his death, which was sometimes untimely, but the increase in the influence of His lfaje8ty t 8 Government and the election by the Omani tribes of a separate leader} the Imam y has reduced the value of tribal support and increased the strength that the claimant has derived from hi a close association with and good intentions towards His Majesty's Government so that today the actual succession will be largely determined by the expressed or presumed favour with which the claim of a particular individual is looked upon by His Uajesty's Government* recognition ^ be accorded to Saiyid Shahab as the heir pre sumptive, I do suggest that, in order to prevent possible strife, arrangements be made to ensure that provided he accepts the required obligations and agreements recognition as Sultan be accorded immediately on his accession. Therefore while X do not consider it desirable that any I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant.

In 1939 he was appointed Minister for External Affairs and given rank immediately after Saiyid Nadir bin Faisalo I have had dealings with Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal during 1939 and 1940 and have always found him courteous and obliging. He has often seemed to be unwilling to maJce a decision but this has been due to his disinclination to do anything of vtfiich the Sultan might not approve.(j) (Enclosure 2) IZ Sai yi d Kadir bin Paisal .

In 1926 he was President of the Council but from then onwards he appears to have played little or no part in affairs of State. In 1933 the allowances and salaries of tne members of the ruling family were reduced and he appears to have been the only member to take exception to the reduction. In fact since 1926 he has confined his official activities to being present on ceremonial occasions^ He has been in indifferent health for some years. He is suffering from an advanced condition of vinereal disease and his speech and mind have now become affected.

Saiyid Tarik remained at school in Germany until he was brought to Muscat by the Sultan in 1937 • Saiyid Tarik speaks German and according to the Sultan has imbibed certain of the Nazi ideas. When he arrived in Muscat he was unable to speak Arabic and unused to eastern manners and customs. His education in Islam and Arabic was taken in hand and he has been kept under strict control.
