Dear Mr. Laithwaite^ I was sorry to have missed you when I called at the India Office on the 6th instant but Mr. Crombie having kindly seen me, I ana now able to write you upon the subject of my visit. I am desirous of obtaining a supply of ed Oxide from the Persian Gulf, from somewhere under the British lag or Protection, and would therefore enquire whether it would be possible and permissible to obtain from the Sheikh of Shargah, a concession or some form of agreement to be allowed to work the ore deposits on the Island of Abu Musa. As far as I can ascertain, at present, all Grulf oxide comes from Persian territory* and though the Abu Musa ore - as known from specimens brought to this country years ago - is not of as high a quality as is the Persian ore, I think a trade in what might be produced from it, is capable of development. The Persian Oulf being what it is, it would seem probable that the possibilities of finding other deposits of better quality and unexploited ore are not unlikely, and I am wondering if I might be informed as to whether any information as to other ore deposits is available in your Office or in that of the Itesident at Bushire and, if so, might the information be made available to me. If/If there Is no objection, on Political ground'., to my suggestionr, I should - after satisfying the India Office as to my credentials and, subject, of course, to any restrictions imposed - suggest sending out a responsible representative to infeatigate the possibilities on the spot. In the aeanwhile - in view of trade ramifications - until anything definite is likely to transpire, 1 should be grateful if the latter my be treated as ^confidential . Yours very truly, (3gd). B.C.

The Shaikh was not prepared to accept a rental of less than Ra ,1500/~ per pl^s the royalty mentioned and kessrs. Sirick finally - in «7une 1928 - intimated that the oxide obtainaule on the island v/as not in their opinion su^i icient ly salea le to warrant their interesting themselves iii it to any further e:ctent. Their decision was communicated to the Shal 'ch who v/as also warned that before concluding an /• agreement with any other applicant he should consult the Political Resident. 2« With regard to other sources ox oxide in the Persian Gulf , the follov/ing is an extract from a letter from Lessrs. F.C.Strick &amp; Co. dated 14th November 1924;- M We may mention that, many years ago, when on a visit' to London, Monsieur Chapuis, the owner of the small steamer in the Persian Gulf coasting trade, who brought Ormu^ Oxide to our I notice, informed us at the time that he knew oi an oxide in the Persian Gulf even better in quality, but unfortunately, before he auvised us as to the locality. Monsieur Chapuis died. According to infomation picked up by Mr • Habakkuk, while at Abu Musa, from an Arab who knew Or muz and Abu Musa Oxides the onl^- oxide in the Gulf comparable with Ormuz is at Dalmah, but we have never seen samples nor have we any inx'ormation by way 01 comirmaticn.

In repl.y we are most ready to give every response in our power to your question hereupon, but, unfortunately, the lapse of time since the receipt by us of the some 100 t* tons ex the S/S 'TABARISTAN 11 is too short for us to venture upon any definite statement, for, as - And in the Oxide World, this latter day shipment of iibu i .usa Ore may be regarded as such - is a question of time, running into many months, and even two years or more; in fact, it takes us the best part of half a year to submit a sample and receive reply from Customers in some parts of the World. In this way we explain thatj so far we have really effected but little business in the 'Tabaristan' parcel, and thus have no real facts upon which to case an estimate as to the tonnage the World's Markets are good xor. All we can, so far, do is to venture an opinion uaaed upon our own judgment of the merits of this Oxide, which is, that at the price last quoted and in the quality last supplied, there should be a real and progressive use for Abu Musa Ore. It undoubtedly has attractions for its full depth of shade is not, in our experience attainable by any means at an economical cost, and, by this, we mean that it should, in our judgment, merit an opening by virtue of its * . / . own /own characteristics at its price| although this does not mean that it could ever encroach upon the field held by Ormuz Red, against which latter Ahu Musa is distinctly inferior 5 None-th^-less Ahu Musa has the attraction 01 a specially dark and good hue of its own, and fills a gap no other Oxide could fill at its price, and, our reconarnendation is that you, at any rate, retain the control for a period of a further year or thereabouts, within which time it should be possible to know what response this Oxide is meeting with, and likely to extend to. The price fixed for the S/S 'Tabaristan' parcel was 70/- per ton, and it it were possible to amend that to 60/- per ton, we should say that reasonable business should, in due course, develop, although we consider it will take some one or two years before these sales could be expected to reach 1000/2000 tons per annum. Much time is lost in the spade-work of introducing a product, but once introduced, we do consider this Oxide is likely to be adopted for regular use, and progressively so* Je just wish we could speak more definitely, but hope you will unaerstand that, at this juncture, it is not possible to us to do so.

He has promised to communicate further with us in the next few days and I will let you know the result. Meantime, we are, as you will see from the letter to Farrer enclosed, mailing enquiries as to his company of the / Department of Overseas Trade, 2, I gather that Commander Bayldon and his company would greatly appreciate any assistance that could be given them in finding a suitable agent to approach the Sheikh, if and when permission is granted to him to proceed with his application. It is perhaps, however, unnecessary to trouble you on this point at the present stage* 3, I am sending copies of this letter to the Government of India,/ The Hon*ble Lt.Col,P.G,Loch, The Residency, Bushire» i I J* IABU MUSA RED 0XID3. Mr. Crombie and I interviewed Commander Bayldon on the 9th July, and explained that his application had now been considered by the interested Departments of His Majesty's Government and that a report regarding it had also been received from the political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 2. I said that in trie first place it was well to warn Commander Bayldon that the Persian Government maintained a claim to Abu Musa in the same way as they maintained the claim to Bahrain with which he was familiar. Their claim was not, however, recognised by His Majesty's Government. He was no doubt also aware that Messrs. Stride had held a concession in respect of Abu Musa between 1923 and 1928. Subject to his producing satisfactory information as to the basis of his firm, as he had undertaken to do in his letter of 25th April (P.Z.2795/34), and to his agreeing to give certain other undertakings, there would be no objection to his submitting his application. Before any approach was made to the Sheikh, His Majesty's Government would, however, require the Company to give an undertaking not to sell, lease, or otherwise transfer to persons who were__not British subjects any concession or contract which/which they might obtain, and a clear understanding as to the nationality of the company would also 'be necessary. Any application must, further, 'be put forward through the Political Resident. 3. Commander Bayldon stated that his company would find no difficulty whatever in agreeing to the various stipulations put forward. His Managing Director, who dealt with the 'business detail of the question, was at present abroad, 'but would 'be in this country in a few days time. He would talk the matter over with him and communicate further with us. 4. I said that it might he well to deal with the question as one of some urgency, as we had now information from the Political Resident that the Sheikh of Shargah had asked permission to give a concession for the Abu Musa red oxide to certain individuals who were believed to be Persian merchants. Commander Bayldon said that he appreciated the situation. I added that the Political Resident had promised some supplementary information by bag and that this would be communicated to Commander Bayldon when it was received. (Sd.)

I now enclose a copy of a letter from him. Would ycu be so kind as to let me know whether the Department of Overseas Trade have any comments to offer and whether they have any information as to the status of Commander Bayldon 1 s firm ? 2. I gather that most of the red oxide from the Gulf is at present produced by Strick from the Persian island of Hormuz, and that Commander Bayldon and his associates are anxious to obtain a concession for Shargah with a view to making themselves independent of Strick. (Strick had, in fact, a concession in respect of Shargah from 1923 to 1928, but it appears to have lapsed in the latter year). They have asked us to keep their intentions wholly confidential at this stage.

The correspondence is, I think, self-explanatory. Commander Baylaon's firm appears to be of good standing ana reliable; he is prepared to give assurances whicn we regard as satisfactory in regard to British control, etc.; on political grounds it would be undesirable that the concession/ The Hon'ble Lieut.Colonel P # G, Loch, The Residency, Bushire. : )S.t&gt;concession on Abu Musa (ana equally any concession in respect of Dalmah) siioula go to a company which is not under British control; and we are anxious therefore to give him such assistance as we properly can. 3. We have discussed with Fowle the rather difficult point raised hy Commander Bayldon as to the line to he taken with the Sheikh of Ahu Dhahi, The sheikh is not precluded hy any of his engagements with us from granting a red oxide concession. On the other hand, for the reasons given in the preceding paragraph (as well as on general grounds) it is desirable that we should have an effective voice in his decision on any application which may be made to him. We do not, at the same time, wish to give rise to rumours as to the existence of valuable deposits in his territory when in fact there may be no such deposits; nor ao we wish to encourage the Persians if they are unsuccessful at ^bu Musa to endeavour to establish themselves on Dalmah. Fowid thinks, in these, circumstances, that, subject to your views, the best course would be that a warning should be given confidentially to the Residency Agent to keep his eyes open to the possibility of the grant of a concession by the/tjii© ohGikli of Abu Dhaoi ojici 'uO lot/ you know 3.% oncG iX there is any sign that the Sheikh has heen approached or that he is entering into discussions; when he could he warned that he must not enter into such discussion or in any way coinmit himself, without the prior approval of His IvJajesty's Government. 4. I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe, and to Worth at Bahrein.nf GIi^LOTTS HOUSE, Confidential. HEITLEY-ON-TIiAI v ISS . 20IT ISA.. Dear Mr. Laithwaite, Many thanl^s for your letter of the 19th instant, since 1 saw you last I have been endeavouring to find out what possible reason there can 'be for this other application for a concession to use the Musa ore, about which you told me. The news came as an absolute surprise to me and it seems an odd coincidence that after all these years of inaction - now, the moment we start moving in the matter, up comes another applicant. Prom what I can make out, however, it would seem that for some reason or another, the Persian concessionaire of the Hormuz deposits no longer controls them, his concession seems inoperative, whether through its period of years having run out or for some other reason, I do not know, but such things, as you probably know much better than I, seem to have a way of happening in Persia, and it looks to me very much as if he is now trying to get another string to his bow by capturing Abu Musa, and using it either as a negotiating point in dealing further with his own Government or else to ship ore from to replace the trade he seems to be in such danger of having lost, Nov; this Persian is merely a middleman between the owners of the soil and we users of the material; prima facie, therefore it would seem obvious that if we can cut out such middleman we can afford to give the Sheikh, better terms direct, thus besides ensuring the whole matter coming under British jurisdiction, it would be to the advantage of the Sheikh to have the actual users as his customer. The/J* 2. The trouble, as I see it, is how to deal with the Sheikh, direct and immediately; I think I gathered from you that if we sent a representative to Sharjah, he would be put in the fort reserved as a resthouse as a safety measure - how would .he be able to investigate the possibilities and sample the ore of Musa. The persian Gulf may have changed since I knew it but I imagine, even today, that the Resident at Bushire might be unlikely to welcome the idea of a British subject, unused to Arabs and their ways and not knowing their language, wandering about the islands in a native vessel, exploring the possibilities of the deposits. Incidentally too there is the physical difficulty of sending out a technical representative during the hot weather season who would be quite unacclimatised, and who would not, of necessity, be able to enjoy the proper housing and so forth, which those permanently serving in the Gulf, have provided for them. But there is the fact of this man, on the spot, a native of those parts, ready and willing to make a bargain forthwith. The only thing which at the moment occurs to me, is that if we could be informed what he is prepared to pay the Sheikh for the concession, we might thus informed, be given the opportunity of considering whether, even with the meagre information we have, we would be prepared to make an equivalent or better offer and thus keep the matter within the British zone of interest. If however, the necessity for an immediate decision could be staved off for a reasonable period, it may be that there are established and trading in the Gulf, reputable British firms, who by their experience and so forth could be trusted by the Resident to undertake for us, negotiations and investigations on the spot, without undue fear that by inexperience and lack of local know ledge they might involve the country in undesirable political troubles.fa v 3. I am, through the Board of Trade, enquiring as to who trades in the Gulf, 'but it occurs to me that possibly, when we meet, you might be able to give me the names of some three (or any other number) of such firms and that we might then get in touch with one or other of them and see what can be done. One of the major » factors we have to keep before us is that from what we have seen in the past, the quality of the Musa ore is not as high as that of Hormuz ore, but that does not make it impossible that there is not better quality ore at Musa - it has never been, as far as we know, expertly investigated on the spot - what has been shipped may well be, what is easiest obtained. One wonders whether, if the concession to work it came into British hands, it would not be possible to obtain the good o-ffices of the Admiralty who are very large users of our finished product, and who are thus directly interested in obtaining the best product as cheaply as possible, to grant some such facilities as would overcome some of the obvious difficulties. Would it be convenient if I fame to see you next Wednesday or Thursday, at 11/45 a.m. or anytime after, and I would bring Llr.Kinnersley (our Managing Director and a technical man) and we might go further into the matter. Yours (Sec. , a ' (Sd) R.C.BAYLDON. J.G.Laithwaite, Esq., Political Department, India Office, Whitehall, S.W.I. » |CONFIDENTIAL . INDIA PEPICS . P.Z.4671/54 . ABU IviUSA Colonel Powle and I discussed with Commander Bay1don ana JWr. Kinnersley on the 25tn July the question of the Iwusa red oxiae. 2. Tne Company were given an outline in the first place of the terms wnich the Sheikh of Shargah had sec ji ed from iwessrs. StricK anQ iiao, Qcmancied as a term of the renewal of the concession granted to Messrs. Strick which expired in 1928. They were also informed of the possioility that red oxiae deposits might exist on the islana of Dalmah, though they were warned that there was no confirmation as to the existence of such deposits. Colonel Powle intimated that in his opinion Mr. Yusuf Kanoo would be the best man to conduct their negotiations for them and they agreed to ascertain from the A.P.O.C. whether that corporation would see any objection to his employment, and if not to get in touch witn him immediately. Colonel Fowle suggested that if for any reason difficulty arose about the employment of Mr. Yusuf Kanoo the Inaia Office should consult the acting Political Resident as to the possibility of finding some substitute. ^Company intimcited that they would much like, before filially committing themselves, to form some impression, by inspection, of the nature and value of the reu oxide deposits. After discussion the best course appeared to be that they should endeavour to secure from the 3heikh of Shargah an option for, say, 6 months at a figure of, say, 500 or 1000 rupees, on the Abu Musa deposits; that Mr. Kinnersley or other representative of the Company should/5/ should proceed to the Guif at the beginning of the cold weather, say in October or November, ana should himself, with such assistance as the political autnorities could &amp; ive him, conauct an inspection ana, if that was thought awsiralDle, enaeavour to obtain a concession from the Sheikh. The opportunity woula also be taken by kr. Kinnersley to check the information which had been received as to red oxiae deposits on Dalmah; but Colonel Fowle thou^t it preferable that the Company shoula make no move as regaras Dalmah at this stage in the interests of preventing rumours spreaaing as to the existence of deposits on that islana. 4. The Company explained that the red oxide deposits at Hormuz seemed to have passed from the Moin-ut-Tujjar to another concessionnaire who was represented by the Persian Consul at tenchester. This concessionnaire was charging very substantial sums, a large consignment of oxide recently received had been valueless and the Company had no remedy in such case against him. They were therefore anxious to renaer themselves independent so far as possible. They intimated that they would be glad to reach some arrangement in regara to red oxide from Hormuz. The Resident saia, however, that (apart from any airect contact which they might establish with any le fe itii;.ate concessionnaire of the Hormuz red oxiae) this woula be a matter falling outsiae his sphere, in so far as Persia and not the Arab siae of tne Gulf woula be concerned. The possibility of Mr. Kinnersley in his forthcoming visit to the Gulf, after investigation of Abu Musa and possibly Dalmah, establishing contact either at Hormuz or at Bushire with the representatives of the Hormuz concessionnaire was, however, alluded to.. 3 - It was agreed that the Inaia Office should now write to the Company recoraing the provisional arrangements which had heen readied ana requesting assurances in regcxra to nationality, etc, of the nature which had heen aiscussea with Commander Baylaon at his earlier interview. &lt;J«G • LAI TH WAI Tiil o 25.7.34.AP.Z. 4671/34.

Dear Commander Bayldon, I write with relerence to the O-iscussicn with you and Mr.Kinnersley on the 25th instant, at which the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was present, on the subject of the Ahu Musa red oxide. 2. In the light of that aiscussion, I understand that your Company propose to ascertain from the Anglo- Persian Oil Company whether they would see any objection to the employment of Mr.Yusuf Kanoo, C.I.E., of Bahrein, to act as your agent in this matter with the Sheikh of Shargah, and that if they see no objection you would propose to invite him to proceed forthwith to Shargah, see the Sheikh and endeavour to obtain an option for six months on the Abu Musa red oxide deposits in return for an appropriate financial consideration, and to intimate to the Sheikh that a representative of the Company would come out to the Gulf in November with a view to inspecting the deposits and reaching a decision as to obtaining a concession from him. I now Commander R.C.Bayldon, R.N.(retd.), write/ Gillotts House, Henley-on-Thames•2. write to confirm that there is no ohjection from our point of view to action on these lines, and that the political authorities in the Gulf will, as Colonel Fowle explained to you, be glad to give you such assistance as lies in their power in the matter. If there should be any difficulty with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company about the use of Mr.Yusuf Kanoo's services, I understand that you will let me know and we will then ask the Acting Political Resident whether he can make any alternative suggestion in the matter of an agent. 3. At our discussion on the 9th July I mentioned that before any approach was made to the Sheikh, His Majesty's Government would require the Company to give an undertaking not to sell, lease, or otherwise assign or transfer to persons who are not British subjects and/or to a non-British Company any concession or contract which they might obts-.n from the Sheikh, and that they would also require a cleev understanding as to the nationality of your Company^ om your letter of 15th July, I understand that the Directors and employees of the Company are all British subjects^ snd that the Company itself is registered in this country• Perhaps/Perhaps you would 'be so kind as to confirm this and also to let me have the assurances to which I have referred in regard to transfer or assignment# 4.

In regard to the point as to British control, I can assure you that as regards the Golden Valley Ochre c- Oxide Co., Ltd. j it is entirely British, 'both as regards registration, shareholders and its Directors. In regard to our largest competitor in the trade with v/hon we propose to collaborate in this matter, I will see to it, that it is a sine qua non, that they too should 'be similarly situated or we will not take them in with us; I think, personally, there is no doubt but that this is the case but I will get it confirmed in writing. In the meantime any option, agreement or so forth which will be come to with the Sheikh, will be made, on our side, in my name personally, and I can thus give you my personal undertaking not to transfer it to anyone to whom exception could be taken under paragraph 3 of your letter of the 26th inst. In the event of the matter coming to a satisfactory conclusion it is our intention to form a separate small limited Company in this country, to operate the business. In forming this, I will see that in the Articles of Association, clear provision is made for British majority ownership and British control. When it comes to drafting the Articles, I will submit them to you, so that you can take advice as to the adequacy of the wording of the provision in question. If by any chance this present intention does not mature we will enter into some bond, properly drawn up, to/U7 to ensure that your stipulation will be carried out. If, perhapsI have omitted any contingency in writing the above it will, doubtless, be covered, if I say we are prepared to carry out your requirements in the spirit as well as in the wording of your letter, I had an interview with one of the Directors of The Anglo-Persian Oil Company on Wednesday afternoon and he called in a Mr. Gass, who has recently returned from the Gulf, where he had been their Manager, They assured me that they had no exclusive call upon the services of Mr. Yusuf ICanoo, C.I.E. of Bahrein, and thus no objection to him executing a commission for me - in fact, I rather gathered from Mr. Gass, who evidently held him in high esteem, that he was glad to see the chance of some business being put in his way. The next step would seem to be that we should write to Mr. Kanoo asking him to undertake the work for us and sending him a copy of the form of option we wish him to obtain for us. In view of para,4 of your letter of the 26th which I undertake to comply with, I shall be happy to send you a copy of our letter to him and of the draft option, before its despatch, should it be of interest to you. In it, will be / generally speaking, the provisions cf which you have kindly acquainted me in your lettei' of the ^.otn, and in order c.hat the local Political Authorities should know exactly Vvhat we have done, the letter to Mr. ICanoo, if it is not causing undue trouble might be sent direct to them, with a request that they would have it passed to him. In regard to the possibilities in the island of Dalmah, I presume much the same state of things applies there as it does at Snarjah. If any application were made to the local Sheik for rights to work or prospect there, he would, oeiore granting them, get the approval of the British Political O-Lficeiw. I mention this, as we set considerable importance to/- 3 - to the possibility and it occurs to me that there is the off-chance oiC the present Persian applicants, if unsuccessful at Abu Musa, might get to hear of the alleged deposits at Dalmah, and might try and get in there as an alternative before November next, when our representative will be on the spot &gt; investigating for us. If such a contingency arose, doubtless it would be possible to assure the Sheik of Abu Dhabi that his interests would best be served by waiting till then, as, if any ore of real value exists in the island, we shall not neglect it, ore of both grades may well prove useful to us^ and a first grade ore certainly of considerable value, as it would compete with Hormuz. The contingency may seem remote but with the coincidence of this native applicant for Abu Musa before us mo cannot neglect the possibility of its occurring. I should like, if I may, to express my thanks to you, for all the trouble you have taken and are taking in the matter and also to Colonel Powle for his very helpful suggestions and his kindness in offering to look after Mr, Kinnersley when he gets out there, all of which we very much appreciate.

I have postponed a reply so that I could take the opportunity to snew it to Colonel Powle. assurances and undertakings given in your letter and that we are communicating them to the Political Authorities in the Persian Gulf. We note in particular that if any concession is obtained hy you it would, as at present contemplated, he operated by a separate small limited company to he formed in this country, clear provision heing made (within the terms of paragraph 3 of my letter of the 26th July, No.p,Z.4671 /S4) for British majority ownership and British control in the Articles o Association, and that the draft of the Articles wou^d he submitted for consideration to the Secretary of State. We note also that if the matter shoula not he handled on this hasis your Company would be prepared to enter into 2 I now write to say that we note the a/ mmander f^.C. Bayldon, R^N,(Retd.), Gillotts House, ' Henley-on-Thames.- a - 10 a bond, properly drawn up, to secure compliance with the stipulations in paragraph 3 of my letter of the 26th July. I take it that I am correct in assuming that in the event of its proving necessary to operate this concession, if obtained, through the Golden Valley Ochre and Oxide Company Limited the undertakings given hy you will he accepted hy and legally binding on that company. 3. I am glad to hear that no difficulty has arisen about the employment of Mr. Yusuf Kanoo. After discussion with Colonel Powle I suggest that it would be best that the Company should address Mr. Kanoo direct, but we shall be glad to see a copy of the draft option before it is despatched, ana we will send a copy of your letter to him and of the draft option to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ana the Political Agent, Bahrein, so that they may be aware of the position. 4. As regards Dalmah I ought to explain that the Sheikh of iibu Dhabi (like the Sheikh of Shargah) is not bound by treaty to obtain the prior consent of His Majesty's Government to the grant of a concession for red oxide. We will, however, mention the point to the Political/- 3 - Political Resiaent and ask him to enaeavour to ensure that the Sheikh does not comnit himself to any other party without first letting tne Resident know. This course seems preferable to giving an iramediate formal warning to the Sheikh, one effect of which would prohahly he to give rise to rumours in the Gulf as to the existence of rea oxiae in the Sheikh's territories and so to defeat the object you have in view.

Dear Mr» Laithwaite, , In reply to your letter of the 3rd instant, I write to confirm, in reference to your paragraph 2, that neither the Golden Valley, nor any other company or person will have any rights under any lease or concession obtained as the result of the matters now under discussion 'between us, until they have complied with whatever stipulations you consider necessary to achieve the object you have in view, I hope to send you a copy of my letter to Mr. Yusuf Kanoo and draft of option in the course of a day or two. There is one other point I would like to mention - When Mr.Kinnersley was speaking to Colonel Fowle about the present position, and its obscurity, as regards the Horrauz oxide concession, owing to the fact that it appears that the concessionaire from the Persian Government, one Haji Muin Bushiri was now dead and that the concession was in the hands of his heirs, and that it would seem that the previous shipper to this country seemed to have lost control of the commodity - Colonel iTowle kindly said he would write out unofficially to the Officer acting for him and find out what the present position was. As I am, as I think I explained to you, rather having to gamble on the possibility of finding a better quality ore at Musa (or elsewhere) than has as yet been seen here, from there, owing to the fact that for certain special demands the ordinary Musa ore is not good enough, I am, naturally, much interested, until such has been found, in what is happening as regards the better quality Hormuz ore, as we do not want to go short of it. If the concession in regard to it was for sale I would certainly be innl 2. in the market as a purchaser if the heirs to Haoi Muin were free to dispose of it and not already under contract to others. Would it 'be unduly trespassing upon your kindness if I asked that a cahle might 'be sent, asking for a reply to Colonel Fowle's unofficial letter by cable - or, if he has not already written - putting the enquiry from him by cable, for cabled reply. Of course I would be glad to defray any costs of such cables and clearly understand that the whole thing would be quite unofficial unless you consider it is the sort of thing one might reasonably ask a Consular Officer out there to do, a point I must frankly confess myself rather in ignorance about.

Dear Mr. Laithwaite, As promised I now enclose a copy of my letter to Mr. Yusuf Kanoo and of the option I wish him to get for me. I have come to the conclusion that it will be quite useless going into matters of detail in regard to the suggested lease from the Sheikh of Sharjah with Mr. Kanoo, as it is impossible for him to know the considerations which will sway me and to explain them in writing would need going into details of a technical nature which one would have to express idiomatically and which would probably convey very little to him. I have accordingly confined myself to the very simple issue as to whether the Sheikh will grant me a lease on the same terms as he did our predecessors, Messrs. Strick. The Sheikh will know what he got out of it and he will surely know that as a matter of fact he had considerably the best of the deal, as Messrs. Strick took so little of the ore, not being ab3a to find a market for it. Unless I hear from you that there is anything in the letter or option to which the India Office would take exception, I propose to post the letter to Bahrein by the air mail which closes here on Friday evening. It may interest you to know that another deposit of iron ore is reported - on the island of bu Na-air, not far from Musa. The report is very brief but (through the courtesy of the Admiralty) I have got the name of the officer who reported it about twelve years ago, but as he has now retired it may take me a little time to trace him and find out if he knows any more about it. It is rather curious to note that if you start at Hormuz and draw a line on the chart/3. chart in a south-v/esterly direction, you cut through the islands of Musa, bu Na-air and Dalmah and that this line is about parallel to the coastline of Oman. It may be coincidence, on the other hand, it may be of geological significance. Yours sincerely, (Sgd. ) R. C. BAYLD01T J. G. Laithwaite, Esq., Political Department, India Office, S.W.I.21 From Commander FU C. Bayldon, R.1J. (retd. ), Gillotts House, Henl ey-on-Thames, Engl and, 15th August, 1934. Dear Sir, I am seeking a reliable Agent to undertake a commission for me in the Persian Gulf and Colonel Fowle, British Resident at Bushire, has given me your name and also Mr. Gass, of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, has spoken to me about you. I am interested in iron ore, and I am writing to ask you whether you will, on my behalf, proceed to Sharjah and there see the Sheikh and ask him to give to me an option for 6 months on a lease of the sole rights f* to work and export the iron ore from his island of Musa. If he will do this, I, on my part, will send out a representative to see the island and its deposits of iron ore and to find out if the iron ore is of a quality which will be suitable for the purposes I have in view. If it is found to be good iron ore, suitable for my purposes, then I will take a lease from him, paying him for the ore, the same as was arranged to be paid to him, ^ some years ago by Messrs. Stricks. Messrs. Strick did not take much of the iron ore as it was found by them not to be the kind which they wanted, and it is for this reason that I have to ask for a definite undertaking that if I want the right to take it I shall have it, as otherwise it is not worth my while to go to the expense of sending out an expert representative to find out if it is of any use to me. It would be useless for me to send out a representative at great expense and then to find that he had/2. had already sold the right to take the ore, to others. If, therefore, the Sheikh is willing to undertake that if I wish to have the iron ore, he will sell me a lease on the same terms as he did to Messrs. Strick, I want you now to pay him a small sum, not exceeding Rs.500, to recompense him for holding the matter open for me, for 6 months, to enable my representative to come out to you in November and see for himself what the iron ore is like, and for this sum the Sheikh must undertake not to deal with other people till my representative has been out to see the ore and he must undertake that if my representative says that it is suitable for my purpose, then he, the Sheikh, will grant me a lease of it, if I am willing to pay him all that Messrs. Strick would have paid him, had they taken it. These payments and all arrangements about them will be arranged later, when my representative has cone out to you as soon as the weather gets cool, if you write and tell me that you have arranged the matter with the Sheikh, in the way I require. I enclose two copies of an agreement which should be entered into by the Sheikh, please put in his name and the amount in rupees you have to pay him, to secure this option on a lease of the sole right to work this iron ore and get him to sign the same at the bottom of the sheet if he agrees to accept this payment for such option, and return me one copy by post and let him keep the other and please explain to him that what you are now paying for is not for the iron ore itself but for his undertaking that if my representative says in November that I shall want the ore, then I can have it, if I pay him for it what was arranged, some years ago, on the same matter between himself and Messrs. Strick. If/3. If business results from t hese negotiations, it will 'be necessary for me always to have in the Persian Gulf an Agent who will attend to the 'business for me. I shall instruct my representative to ask you if you would wish to act thus as my Agent and to arrange with you as to what terms and conditions should be come to between us - he will also arrange the payment to be made to you for acting for me now, upon the business which I am now asking you to undertake for me. In regard to the expenses which you will be incurring in connection with your Journey to Sharjah and the payment to be now made to the Sheikh, it is many years since I 'was in the Persian Gulf and I do not icnow the present condition of affairs there. Will you please telegraph to me what you estimate it will cost and I will arrange a telegraphic transfer of funds to you, through the Eastern Bank at Bahrein, so that there may be no delay in proceeding with the business. Please telegraph me to; Bayldon, Henley-on-Thames, and when v/riting use the Air Mail to save delay. Yours faithfully, (Sgd. ) R. C. BAYLDOIT Mr. Yusuf Kanoo, C.I.E., Bahrein.9H In consideration of the Sum of Rupees the receipt of which I hereby acknowledge - I, Sheikh of Sharjah, do hereby undertake to grant unto Commander Robert Corbett Bayldon, R.K. (retired) of Gillotts House, Henley-on-Thames in England (or, at his request through his duly appointed representative) at any time within six (British) calendar months from the date hereof - the sole right to work and export the iron ore which is situated in my island of Musa, upon the same terms and conditions as I did last grant this same right (which has now expired and has not been renewed) to Messrs. Strick and during such six calendar months I will permit the said Commander Bayldon or his representatives to visit the island and inspect the ore deposits in order that they may see for themselves whether such iron ore is suitable for the purposes for which they would require it. Dated this _____ 1534. Sheikh of SharjahINDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.I. j 16th August, 1934. P .Z. 5304/34. Dear Commander Bayldon, Many thanks for your letter of 15th August enclosing a copy of your draft letter to Mr. Yusuf Kanoo and of the draft option. As regards the letter itself, I would suggest that you should inform Mr. Kanoo that you unders tand • that the Sheikh had given the Strick concession of 1923 on the general 'basis set out in my confidential letter to you of 25th July, No.P.Z.4671/34. I make this suggestion for two reasons - the first that it may oe of value to Mr. Kanoo in his discussions with the Sheikh to have an outline in general terms of the previous concession (the Sheikh may well wish to ask much higher terms now than he was prepared to accept ten years ago); the second, that you will remember that we thought it preferable here to pass on this detailed information to you confidentially. We think also that both in the letter/ Commander RcC. Bayldon, R.N.(retd.), Gillotts Houss, Henley-on-Thame s.letter and in the option the reference should be to 'red oxide' (the phrase used in previous concessions) and not to 'ore' or to 'iron ore', which may give the Sheiiih a false impression and lead him to raise his demands. As regards the option we find some difficulty in following the words in brackets in lines 5 and 6 ('or at his request through his duly appointed representative') and would suggest that it would be better to omit them altogether. I take it that you are not yourself going out to the Gulf and that any discussion with the Sheikh would be conducted either by Mr. Kinnersley or by Mr. Yusuf Kanoo. But the option will in any event be in your name and so long as your representative has full power to accept an option on your behalf, that would seem to be all that is required. Many thanks for the interesting information in your letter about Sir Abu Nair. I am sending copies of this correspondence to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and to the Political Agent, Bahrein. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) J. G.

Dear Sir, I aia seeldlag a reliable Agent to undertake a conaaission for me in tne Persian Guli t anci Colonel i 1 cv,'le, British Resident at Bushire, has given me your name, and also Mr. Gass, of the Anglo-Persi an Oil Company, has spoken uO me alaout you. I am interested in red oxide, and I am writing to ask you whether you mil, on my behalf, proceed to Sharjah and there see the Sheikh and ask him to give to me a n option fo r six months T on a lease of the sole rights to work and export the red oxide from his island of Musa. If he will do this, I, on my part, will send out a representative to see the island and its deposits of red oxide and to find out if any of it is of a quality which will be suitable for the purposes I have in view. If any is found to be good red oxide, suitable for my purposes, then I will take a lease from him, paying .^iiu for the oxide, the same as was arranged to be paid to him, some years a/;o, in 1923, by Messrs. Strick • For your information I would mention that I understand that the arrangement between the Sheikh and Messrs. Strick was, that liessrs. St rick had a lease of the sole rights to this oxide for a period of 5 years, icr which tney paid the Sheikh the sum of Hs.GOCO/- down, and, in addition, a royalty to the Sheikh of Rs.S/- per ton of oxide exported by them, with a guaranteed minimum payment of such royalty of/2. ox Hs .EOOO/- a year, whether any oxide was exported or not. The lease provided that a representative of the Sheikh should he present when oxide was shipped to check the ainount on behalf of the Sheikli, and the Sheikh undertook to maintain an Agent to afford assistance to Messrs .Strick in affairs relating to their work, and he undertook to grant permission for the construction of houses for labourers and so fortn, provided that the divers living on the island or harbour were not interfered with, and the Sheikh further undertook that he would demand no taxes of any description beyond the amounts provided for in the lease. On the other hand, he would not be required to defray any expenditure in relation to it, all expenses of digging, transport, labour and boat hire being paid by Messrs ,3trick, and that at the end. of 5 years the lease would be open to renewal by Messrs.Strick, subject to agreement between them and the Sheikli as to terms# It is possible and even perhaps likely, that you will find that the Sheikh may demand larger sums in a lease to-day, than he did ten years ago; if he does so, please make it clear to him that there is no reason for it - he should be glad to get as good terms again, as it is generally well known here, that Messrs.Striok took very little of this red oxide and did not renew the lease, because they could not sell the oxide when they got it here, as its quality was such that it did not compete with oxides from Spain; they thus made no profit on the transaction, and I am only taking an interest in the matter at all, because I think it just possible that an expert man might find some oxide on the island of a quality which could be made use of and/K\ 3. and it is for this reason tliat I hay© to ask for a definite undertaking that if I vjant the right to take it I shall have it, as otherwise it is not worth my while to go to the expense of sending out an expert representative to find out if it is of any use to me. For instance, it would 'be useless for me to send out a representative at great expense and then to find that he had already sold the right to take the ore, to others. If, therefore, the Sheikh is willing to undertake that if I wish to have the red oxide, he will sell me a lease on the same terms as he did to Messrs.Strick, I want you now to pay him a small sum, not exceeding Rs.500/-, to recompense him for holding the matter open for me, for 6 months, to enable my representative to come out to you in November and see for himself what the oxide is like, and for this sum the Sheikh must undertake not to deal with other people till my representative has been out to see the oxide, and he must undertake that if my representative says that it is suitable for my purpose, then he, the Sheikh, will grant me a lease of it, if I am willing to pay him all that Messrs.Striok would have paid him, had they taken it, These parents and all arrangements about them will be arranged later, when my representative has come out to you as soon as the weather gets cool, if you write and tell me that you have arranged the matter with the Sheikh, in the way I require, I enclose two copies of an agreement which should be entered into by the Sheikh, please put in his name and the amount in rupees you have to pay him, to secure this option on a lease of the sole right to work this red oxide, and get him/4 4* him to sign the same at the 'bottom of the sheet if he agrees to accept this payment for such option, ani return me one copy by post and let him keep the other and please explain to him that what you are now paying for is not for the red ozide itself out for his undertaking that if my representative says, in November, that I shell want the oxide, then, I can have it, if I pay him for it, what was arranged, in 1923,on the same matter between himself and Mes s rs.Strick • If business results from these negotiations,it will be necessary for me, always to have in the Persian Gulf,an ♦ Agent who will attend to the business for me* I shall instruct my representative to ask you if you would wish to act thus as my Agent and to arrange with you as to what terms and conditions should be come to between us - he will also arrange the payment to be made to you for acting for me now, upon the business which I am now asking you to undertake for me.

Submitted• In accordance with your verbal instructions I visited Bu Musa on Sunday, 8th July, to see if anything was known of prospectors for the iron oxide in which the Island abounds. 2). My interpreter went to the village. The bulk of the population were away on the pearl banks, but he talked with the Shaikh of Sharjah T s caretaker. This man said that many years ago people had been there working the ore, but no one had tried since. In the general conversation he spoke of the 'Ormonde f s ' visits. He said also that a white ship with many lights had anchored off the island during the derk hours three nights before. This may have been 'Nearchus n . 3). Meanwhile I walked over the island to see what there was there. At the northern end of the beach at the South-East corner of the island there is an old loading dump of the ore. Cart tracks lead to it - and some hundreds of old rotting bags are lying about. I would say that they were at least five years old - which fits with the caretaker^ idea. Further on by one of the small red hills mentioned in the Sailing directions is the pit from which the ore in the dump evidently came. 4). I then walked across the Island and up to Jebel Halwa. The island is a flat plain with a few small outcrops of rock which form the small hills. The whole of this plain is formed of the same red material. From a cursory reference to an encyclo paedia it answers to the description of Hoematite (Fe2 03) containing 70^ of iron. Practically the whole island seems to be formed of it, and the old workings were on a scale which barely touched the fringe of it. 5). At the bottom of Jebel Halwa there is a well sunk into solid rock which seems unlikely to have been made by Arabs. The well was empty, but probably fills with drainage from the Jebel in the winter. 6). I saw no sign of any recent prospecting, but a very thorough examination would be necessary to say definitely that there had been none, though it seems unlikely.T.

Under instructions from Tehran, the Director of Customs saspended the mining operations of the red oxide mines ct Hormu^ by Haji Muin's men, though the term of the concession is said to be expiring two years hence. It is believed that the interruption is due to failure on the part of the concessionaire to pay the stipulated rent in time. The Director has gathered necessary information as to the working of the mines for Tehran, He has remarked that th* Government wish to undertake the work the.:iselves, and contradicted the rumour that the ^apanse® will be the next concessionaires, adding that it is against the policy of the Government to lease the mines to foreigners. mBy Air Mail. p.z. y^' 19 ■1 iv /uf INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, 2 3 NOV 1934 Forwarded with the coinpliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

He has not visited Dalrnah, as I gather the Sheikh is rather 'difficile' at the moment, but Colonel Loch hopes the matter will be only a question of time and could thus be arranged if we have a man out there, later, taking a shipment frcm Musa. He has now gone on to Teheran to see for himself what is the position of matters there and hopes to be in Paris by about the 7th December, but I do not know when to expect him home, as he has work to do in Spain before finally returning.

We nad a meeting on the subject of the Masa_oxide and the Golden Valley and Via Gel11a Gompany's representatives came to the conclusion that while it w as not quite the same colour as the Hormuz ore, it possessed qualities which woula make it a good substitute, and we decided to go ahead with the natter.

Would you be kind enough to let me know if there are any restrictions vvhicn he would encounter in doing so, and if any permits are necessary and how they should he obtained. He will go out by sea via India. I recollect one used not to be allowed to take a .303 rifle there, but possibly if going to the Gulf it could be passed through Karachi 'in bond'. I should be grateful for any information on the present day position. Also I am wondering whether he would have to have some official permit to travel in those parts or whether an ordinury passport is sufficient. Yours sincerely, h.c. bayldon.

When Mr. Kinnersley was out there ne was unable to visit the island of Dalmah, owing to the fact that at that time the sheikh of Abu Dhabi was a little 'difficlie'. Colonel Loch was, however, expecting to visit him within the course of a few weeks and he anticipated that after his visit tne sheikh's attitude might well be different. I am writing to ask if, when next you write out to there, you woula be kina enough to enquire if there is any further development in this matter, as we should like, if possible, Mr. Barnett to investigate Dalmah and it would be very helpful if we could hear if such a visit would now be welcomed by the sheikh. It may well be that Colonel Loch may not yet have been there but may be going there sometime between now and next March, in which case, if he would be kind enough to write a line to Mr. Barnett direct and send it through his subordinate at sharjah, I expect some way would/It? - 2 - J.G.

His pay will probably be something in the vicinity of Rs.50/- &amp; month. S. You do not mention what size of house you require and I would suggest that the best plan, as rtgtrds accommodation, would be for Mr. Barnett and the miner to bring tents and camp at Abu kusa. Then they could at leisure select the site for permanent quarters and decide what size and construction of house Is best. The tents should be double fly and you would probably find the i - 'Swiss Cottage 1 type the most satisfactory. 3. They should bring warm clothing and oil stoves as it is likely to be cold. No tinned stoves are obtainable nearer to Abu Musa than i^nrain. 4.

Red OxLde -do- -do-T ote by ^r. N.S .Kinnersley on his visit to Abu Musa Island, T visited the Island of Abu Musa on the 9th November 1934 and examined certain heaps of mineral that had been extracted some fifteen years ago, which proved to be of second £ ;id third rate quality. I tnen visited, in company with the head-man of the village, three situations on the Island, vhere this or^ had been extracted. Two of these proved to be again of second class ore but the third outcrop v. here the chief body of ore had been extracted, situated some half mile inland from the coast, contained in the main exposed body of the ore, a vein or layer of oxide which, in my opinion, if carefully extracted should produce a finished oxide, reasonably close in quality to Hormuz oxide. The reason that the oxide in the piles vss of such poor quality being due to the fact that this good oxide vas extracted in conjunction with probably some 70# of very Inferior oxide and even iron ore devoid of colouring matter. I then returned to the mainland to visit the Shaikh of oharjah by whom I was well received and I informed him that we should be proceeding as early as possible with the opening up of the mine. I then proceeded dovn the coast to Dibai, ! here I also visited the Shaikh vho again was exceedingly friendly. At this point I chartered a motor dhow and left for Abu Dhabi in order to visit the Shaikh and obtain nis permission to land on the Island of Dalmah to ascertain if oxide of good quality was obtainable there. On landing at Abu Dhabi I visited the Shaikh at his fort and was received quite well until I named the object of my visit. The Shaikh then stated that he thought I was a ' ater Engineer whose services had been promised by the Government for some time and he was very displeased that I was not in a position /to adviseto advise him on the question of the irrigation of his crops. 1 ' 1 : say tnat under the circumstances he was not prepared to give any permission to land on the Island of Dalmah. I enoe-'voureo to reason v.ith him through my interpreter vithout avail and finally with reluctance had to abandon the Journey rr-turni'ig in the motor dhow to Bahrein. (initialled). M.P.K. 14-11-1934.(2) Copy of letter dated 10th December 1934 from Lr .P.T.Cox, of Gordon ^och. Political Agent, Bchrain. I am sencing with this note four samples of Red Ochre: the two bags merked W Y' were collected on YoS Island from out crops about two miles west-north-west of the prominent blugts ne&amp;r the coast on the east side of the island; the bags marked D were collected about one mile north-east of the village on Calmah Island. On both these islands the red oxide occurs es irregular pocKets in the heterogeneous mass of rocks brought to the surface by salt plug intrusions. These rocks include basic igneous volcanics, indurated sandstones and shales, black limestones of Cambrian age and gypsum with interbedded mc.rls and marly limestones. On Yas Island the oxide generally occurs near to end largely contaminated by masses of gypsum. On i-aimeh Island the dominant rock, at surface. Is quartz porphyry. Iii ot; localities specularlte occurs wltn the red ochre. -jn ..alal Island there is sorae haematite, partly In the form of red ochre, near the south and south-west coasts. On this Island, which Is also of salt plug origin, the dominant surj.ace roclt is black Cambrian limestone. Altii rt^aro. to quantities of red ochre available on the three Islands visited, it would appear that Dalmah Is some what richer than Yas Island and that Halul contains only a :;maU deposit. Since the ochre occurs as Irregular masses, no txfct tat1rate of available quantities can be made without extensive pitting or auguring. In the Persian Gulf area red cc i- Is only known to occur In quantity In the material brought to surface by Intrusions of Cambrian or possibly pre -Cambrlan salt. It was probably formed originally by the action of circulating waters on basic Igneous rocks causing concentration and oxidation of contained ferro-magneslan minerals. It Is t-ere+ors not possible to forecast to what extent there is an LHiotrground development of ociire within economic reach of the2. surface. I have no experience of mining methods nor the value of red ochre but presume thet a deposit is worth exploiting only if it contains a high percentage of ultra-fine grained red iron oxide. £he sample 's sent are fairly representative of the best exposures seen, as will be seen from them, there is, in addition to extraneous sandy matter, gypsum etcetera, a nigh percentage of relatively cosrse grained red oxide. From the locality sampled in ^almah it is probably possible to obtain at least 50 cubic feet of ochre of this Quality and there are some five or six other localities on the same island where apparently smaller accumulations outcrop.(Copy) D.0.No;C/962-10/7• 12th December 19S4, Dear Mr. Kinnersley, I enclose a copy of a note which was kindly made tor me by a geologist who accompanied me on a tour which I have just finished. 2* As time is possibly short before your representa tive comes out here to start exploitation on Abu Musa Island, I am sending small portions of the samples by air freight. I also enclose two sanples marked r, L Tf , which were given oo me by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. When asked wfeere they came from, he replied vaguely 'From the Islands', but evidently did not wish without consultation to say the exact place.. 4. The Shaikh is now, I think, quite willing for you or your representative to go to any of the Islands to have a look round, but this should not be attempted till after Ramadhan (which ends about the 8th January) and, if you send anyone, I should like plenty of notice so that I can arrange matters. settled finally with the launch, during my recent visit to Sharjah, giving them Rs.601/-. It is too much really, but in all the circumstances I did not like to reduce it further lest it should react on your arrangements later on.

Shortly, the procedure will be that Mr.Barnett will be asked to complete a form of application similar to the one enclosed, and to support the application by producing (a) a firearm certificate authorising him to hold the rifle in this country; or(b) if there is no firearm certificate, but he desires to purchase the rifle for the purpose of exportation, documentary eridence that he is leaving the country. Such evidence usually takes the form of a passage ticket. In the case of (a), the licence will enable Mr.Barnett to take the rifle to the outgoing vessel, or to have it sent forward with his heavy baggage, just as he pleasea In the case of (b), hov/ever, the licence will be endorsed requiring the gunsmith from whom the rifle is to be purchased, to despatch the weapon to the outgoing vessel. I am to confirm that so far as I am aware, there^s no objection to the transhipment of firearms at Indian ports,and that on the presumption that the local import permit will be forthcoming, no objection will be raised by this Department as to the calibre of the firearm which Mr.Barnett desires to export.

L BEDOfiOi \ , ^ I write with reference to Loch's express letter or 30th December, c /1014.13/7, to say that we have passed on the suggestions in paragraphs 3 and 4 to Comuander Bayldon, as Mr. Barnett is understood to be likely to proceed in the immediate future. 1^1; 2. As regards paragraph 2 of his letter, you will have seen from the correspondence with^the Passport Office, copies of which were sent teyou and to Bahrein under our printed letter P.z.9V&lt;5 of 4th Januaiy, that both jv ^. Bamett and the miner have been given pas ^orts vise for Bahrein and Koweit, but that it was considered unnecessary grant a 3p eclal vlsa for or ^ ^ , in cases such as this, you would in future like specific visas given for Shargah (or other points on the I'rucial coast which individuals may be permitted to visit) Perhaps you would be so kind as to let us know and we will so Inrorm the Passport Office? 018 '•b^. SMUre. . 3/ConliQential . D.O.N0.I8I-S of .936• The Hesidency, Bushire, 6th February 1936. IC t'tl Could you please rexer to youi 1 letter No.P.Z.176/36 of the 9th January 1936 on the subject of visas for the Trucial Coast. 2. The position is that before the issue of Foreign Office y \ Circular No»T 2117/693/378 of 10th larch 1932, nobody, whether British or Foreign, could visit the Trucial Coast without special permission from the Resident. By this Circular, however, we have put the Shaikhdoms of the Trucial Coast on the same terms as the other Shaikhdoms; Muscat, Jahrain and Kuwait, for which foreigners cannot obtain visas without reference to us, but for which British subjects &lt;*an get visas, (which cannot well be refused them by the Consular authority concerned as long as they are respectable individuals) without any such reference. In other words the F. reign Office Circular in question, in the paradoxical wa^ in which things happen in the Gulf, while intended to strengthen our ha^ids, and actually doing so as regards foreigners in general visiting the Arab Coast as a whole, has weakened it with regard to the Trucial Coast. 3. Neither the Trucial Coast towns,(we do not allow Imperial Airways passengers to enter Sharjah town), still less the interior, are really fit places for casual foreigners or British subjects, to visit or reside or travel in, unless in special circumstances. rve can ot from the practical point of view adopt the 'at your own risk' attitude, since in the case / J.G.Laithwaite ^squire,C.I., The India Office, London.case of anything unpleasant happening to a British or Foreign traveller the onus of taking some action rests on us. I would like therefore as far as the Trucial Coast is concerned to get back to the old position that nobody, whether British or Foreign, should visit it without special permission from the Resident, 4. In order to effect this a iresh clause would presumably have to be inserted in the Foreign Office Circular quoted above and worded something as follows: Neither British, nor Foreign, subjects can visit tne Umm al i^aiwain /irab States of: Qatar, bu Jhabi, Dlbai, ^Jmany^Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah, without special permission irom the Resident, Persian Gulf, to whom applications shoula be made by intending travellers through the nearest British authorities• 6. we can meet without difficulty any complaints from British subjects over this restriction. If any foreigner is refused permission, and complains through his (or heri) Govern ment, we are on strong ground in pointing out that owing t,o local conditions residence, or travel, in those areas is not safe lor the casual traveller, and that owing to our special position in those areas, we have a measure of responsibility ior the saiety of fore-gn travellers. li tv-is restrictioii were imposed each case would of course be considered on its merits and any special circumstances taken into account. I quite realise that in these days, when the whole of the Arab Coast is being opened up, it is much more difficult than formerly to prevent travellers visiting it.

Kvo .. 7 C -V* ftf ./J' I met Mr•Kinnersley on the 'Barala' and gave him your letter, ne said he would have been very glad to meet you and that he would have telegraphed you an intimation to dinner if he could have been certain of the time of arrival of the boat. He had already wired intimation to Political Agent, Bahrain, of his arrival, but had not mentioned that he was accompanied by his son - a boy of about 18. He will wireless this to Ml?. Worth. He did not appear to think much of the possibilities he of Abu Musa. Whatsis really keen on is examining Dalmahand * Sir Bii Nair. He did not appear to relish the prospect of doing his journeys to the islands by motor dhow and asked whether you would be able to assist him by arranging for him K to travel - to Dalmah at any rate - on a sloop and could telegraph to Colonel Loch to this effect. I gave him your message about first consulting Colonel Loch in regard to his plans and said that if Colonel Loch was not back by the time he (Mr.Kinnersley) reached Bahrain (probably Tuesday morning) he would in all probability be back by the next Westbound air mail and that, if urgently necessary, Mr. Worth could consult Colonel Loch by telegram. He told me that Yusuf Kanoo was at present in Baghdad. 4 , A ^lu</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000ec_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/263</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000ec</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/263</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'14/115 X, B 31, Abu Musa Oxide'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-11T00:16:27</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (212 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged chronologically from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>The foliation sequence starts at the titlepage and continues through to the 5th folio from the back of the volume.
