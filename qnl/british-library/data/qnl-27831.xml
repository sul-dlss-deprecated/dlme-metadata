YJMGHTMAN. Offg. Political Resident in the (Designation) Persian Gulf.Confidential ').O.N Q.1B22/9-A. Bahrai 1958. Dear heightman. Before His Hieinneas left for the Haj he approved of ray suggestion that hi a son Shaikh Abdullah should be sent to England for a year in order to acquire a good knowledge of English. I mentioned this matter to you and to the Hon’ble the Political Resident some time ago. Since then I have been dealing with the matter and in order not to cause any unnecessary trouble I have got into touch with people myself. The Hon'ble the Political Resident, as you remember, told us that the Shaikh of Kuwait had asked him to arrange for his son to go to England and fifter taking a great deal of trouble the Shaikh had changed his mind at the last moment. Vhen Hi a Highness was in England I took him and the sons to Oxford for the day and from that time Dhaikh Abdullah expressed a desire to go to Oxford. It is of course impossible for him to become an undergraduate but I think Oxford is a most suitable place for him to be in ~---q because there are so many youn^ men there from foreign parts and there are people there who deal with foreign students. I then wrote to a very old friend of mine, the ivev. R.R.Uartin, Chaplain of New College and Vicar of &gt;t .Michaels. He was at school with me and also at Oxford with me. I also wrote to Mr .K .C.Mar chant, sub-Rector of Lincoln, my own college whom I have known since I was up there. These two recommended a Colonel Gordon Browne, O.l.O., who takes in a few pupils many of whom have been f or*igners • Gordon Browne is a Cambridge M.A. lie was &amp;t Gandhur at/Sandhurst but left the arniy before the #ar and took up coaching. He joined up again during the *ar and was in command of his regiment (the Worcesters) in France, then on the staff and then served in the hast. He passed the staff Arabic examination. He retired and has lived in Oxford for a good many years as a sort of superior coach. He has several youn^ men living with him and coaches some himself and has tutors ixi for others. He is married, hi a wife comes from Norfolk and I know of some of her relations who are proper people. See WHO*S WHO. He is now living in H&amp;nbttry road but is moving into a larger house in March. Hoth Martin and Marchant Know him personally and strongly recommend him. My idea is that if Jhaikh Abdullah goes to his place he will get something of college life without the college. I also think that it is an advantage for him to be in a place where there are people who Know him and can sometimes see and entertain him. He met both Martin and Marchant at Oxford and he and his father spent most of a day with some cousins of mine who have a house in the country outside Oxford. They too would deal with him. I used to live in Oxfordshire and I know people round lab out there. Gordon Browne’s establishment is not cheap. His terms are ?1,000 for one year, this is his normal charge, but from what I hear of t he way he looxs after the boys, I do not think it is very expensive. It would probably be possible to find somewhere cheaper, but if the experiment turns ouI, a success, I thinx it would be worth that money. Gordon Browne saya that he will teach Shaikh Abdullah ^glish and coach him in tne rudiments of international, civiland criminal law. These are subjects I suggested. He would also give him the opportunity of learning about English ideas and customs and would take him about to various places inland and by the sea. He would have his own sitting room and bedroom and fires and all that sort of thing. I have written to Sir Verney Lovett, K.C.S.I., Header in Indian History at Oxford and to Sir Richard Burn, K.C.I.iS., retired I.C.3., asking for more particulars hbout Gordon Browne and I hope to hear from tnem shortly. There are still various particulars wnich I nave to go into. If the arrangement is approved of 1 should like to send ;ihaikh Abdullah to England in March or early April and when I am home I shall be able to see him at Oxford. /ill you please inform the Hon’ble the Political Resident about this matter ? His Highness left it to me to make all arrange ments but knowing how sometimes people change their minds I thought it beat not to involve the Government of India in any trouble over the scheme until I had dealt with it myself up to this point. Yours sincerely, 3d. C.J&gt;. BELGHAVE H. Weight man, Kspaire, I.C.3., H.B.M.
