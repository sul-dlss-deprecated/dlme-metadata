Your Excellency I have carefully considered in consultation with His Majesty's Secretary of State for India Your Excellency's note of May 10th. last complaining of the j hoarding of the French dhow 'Musaffa' hy a British Naval Officer off Kholab. I have the honour to infom Your Excellency, in the first place, that the account of this incident given to the French Consul at Muscat is not in all respects accurate. The Officer in charge of the hoat*s crew went on hoard the dhow alone, and not accompanied hy sailors; and* the statement that the hull was searched and the passengers* luggage broken open is not home out hy the facts as reported to His Majesty*s Government. Moreover the Officer left the 'iviUsaffa'* as soon as he had verified the dhow's papers. His His Excellency monsieur CamhonHis Majesty*s Government regret that a British Officer should have exceeded his instructions in hoarding a vessel flying the French flag, hut they feel that every allowance should he made for the diffi cult position in which the Officer was placed and they are convinced that the French Government would not wish to magnify the inevitable accidents which must sometimes happen in the performance of such a duty. The reasons which compel His Majesty *s Government to suppress the illicit traffic in arms in the Persian Gulf are well known to Your Excellency, and you are aware that it is their earnest desire to arrive at a friendly settlement v/ith France which will put a stop there to an evil that is contrary to the interests of all civilised Powers, and in the suppression of which in other parts of the world, notably on the Somali Coast and in Morocco, the two Governments co-operate. Mean while, if occasionally the British Officers on the spot have reasonable doubts as to the genuine character of claims to French protection and seek to establish the true facts by enquiry. His Majesty*s Government rely upon the good-will of a friendly Power to overlook pre cautions which inflict no real injury and are not in tendedintended to challenge any legitimate rights of the Prencli flag. In a Lemorandum of April 1st, 1910 His majesty's Ambassador at Paris reminded the French Government of the circumstances in v/hich His Majesty's Government, acting in concert with the Persian Government and with the Sheikhs of the Arabian Coast, were compelled to take active measures for the suppression of the Arms traffic in the Gulf, a traffic v/hich had produced on the borders of the Indian Empire a state of things intolerable to any Government. The representations then made have remained without effect, the French Government having felt unable to consider any arrangements on a basis that could be entertained by His Majesty's Government, with a view to closing Muscat to the free importation of arms. The continuance of active measures has therefore been forced on His Majesty's Government much against their will. The situation is admittedly an unsatisfactory one, but it is one which it is in the power of the French Government to terminate at any moment by adopting a policy in consonance with the obligations generally acceptedaccepted by European States to co-operate in checking the distribution of modern weapons of precision amongst uncivilised races. I have &amp;c., (Signed) E. Grey.Sir, India Office, June 1911. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the 23rd May 1911, No. 18,190, forwarding copy of a Note from the French Ambassador as to the boarding of the French dhow Musaffa by a British naval officer in the Persian Gulf. 1 he Earl of Crewe agrees that, notwithstanding the suspicious behaviour of the dhow, the British officer must be held to have exceeded his rights in boarding a vessel flying the French flag. But he feels it necessary to add that every allowance should be made for the difficult position in which Mr. Midshipman Morgan was placed, and he trusts that the French Government will recognise that inevitable accidents need not be magnified on the one band, nor too readily repudiated on the other. The insuperable reasons which compel His Majesty’s Government to suppress the illicit traffic in arms in the Persian Gulf are well known, and it is their earnest desire to arrive at a friendly settlement with France which will put a stop to an evil that is contrary to the interests of all civilised Powers. If occasionally the officers on the spot have reasonable doubts as to the genuine character of claims to French protection, and seek to establish the true facts by inquiry, it is not too much to ask a friendly Power to overlook pre cautions which inflict no real injury, and are not intended to challenge any legitimate rights of the French flag. Lord Crewe would leave it to Sir E. Grey to decide whether the present incident might not usefully be made the occasion of offering some further remarks to the French Government on the general subject in connection with the memorandum presented to M. Pichon on the 1st April 1910. It might be pointed out that, although there is no prohibition on the import or export of arms in Oman, their importation in Persia and elsewhere on the Persian Gulf littoral is strictly prohibited by the authorities concerned; and that incidents such as that of the Musaffa, though its immediate cause may have been an excess of zeal on the part of a subordinate officer, must always be liable to occur so long as the illicit traffic in arms continues to be carried on from Muscat. The French Government are aware of the circumstances in which His Majesty’s Government, acting in concert with the Persian Government, and with the sheikhs of the Arabian coast, were compelled to take active measures for the suppression of the arms traffic in the Gulf. The continuance of these measures has been forced upon them, much against their will, by the failure of the French Government to consider arrange ments on a basis that could be entertained by His Majesty’s Government with a view to closing Muscat to the free importation of arms. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.The situation is admittedly an unsatisfactory one, but it is one which it is in the power of the French Government to terminate at any moment by adopting a policy in consonance with the obligation, generally accepted by European States, to cooperate in checking the distribution of modern weapons of precision among uncivilised races.

In continuation of my report,* camp No. 1, dated the 23vd Aprii, I have the honour to report that, the Mekran • serial No. 131. (Field Force landed at Sirik in Biyaban on the 24th April. 2 Mir Haiji, Governor of Biyaban, accompanied the troops and gave all ecessarv information regarding the political situation. Mir Barkat had. with ,e assistance of Glmlam Hussain Bashkardi, pillaged Biyaban, with the •nfnlrl nhiect of re-establishing the arms trade with the Afghans, and of nstim' Mir Haiii who had undertaken to stop it, and had already taken active ens £ preventing Blvaban from being infested by Afghans Besides Ghulam liFssain P Mir Barkat had the whole of the Tahirzai clan of Biyabnn at his back nd they had already taken a prominent part in recent disturbances. 3 The first thing to be ascertained on arrival at Sink was to what extent . .i i nn .M o.et sunnort from the remaining Bashkardi clans. It was ■enerally accepted that neither the Darusar nor the Maras Bashkardis would oin in. These two clans are considered the most important in Bashkard tolitics; they are both situated north of Jagdan. 4 Mir Barkat and Ghulam Hussain were both reported to be at Sahra-i- . r : tll a combined following of about seven to eight hundred men. Lo the jurgvutliac wa | i s fandiar Khan of Sindnk, of whose active 'kBarn HLFn^gXthe and tlussain. j t was introduced into the problem by the new9 tl ’ at ., th ® Afohans from Fanooch had sent a letter to Mir Barkat to the effect that they i • j thMt hp wus under no circumstances to come to terms would support im, u from Fanooch early in April while ^ftroops were Sing to Bint, and I have no doubt iu my own mind that it was iKv to an appeal from Mir Barkat asking them to 30 m him in his onerations G that this message was sent. Apparently our direct march on Bint as already reported, caused them to leave Banooch and to give up all ide57 assisting Barkat, as none of them hare been reported as arriving either at Poshaak or Sahra-i-gurg. The only Afghans in this part of the country were those already reported by Captain Craufurd as being with Mir Barkat number ing from twenty to thirty men. 6. Mir Ilajji wrote to Isfandiar Khan asking him to co-operate, and also to other minor Bashkard Chiefs, telling them that if they valued his friendship they should meet him when he came up with the troops either at Gwaj or Davao. 7. Sarzeh was reached with no opposition; it was here ascertained that Mir Barkat was si ill at Sahra-i-gurg and that the road between Gwaj and Davan was held at various points in the narrow gorges of the Gwaj river. 8. On the 28th April, the enemy was encountered at Poshaak, and driven out of the defile into the valley beyond, to which they stubbornly retired. A party of the enemy in their flight encountered a few men sent out by Mir Hajji under Khudadad, the son of Mir Kambar, who were acting on our rk-ht flank. This party was too small to take part in the general engagement. Colonel Delamain has suitably rewarded both Chiefs for their co-operation. 9. The force camped on the enemy’s position and returned to Gwaj on the 29th April. This unexpected move was a severe blow to both Mir Hajji and Mir Kambar, who both considered that another day’s march to Sahra-i- gurg would not only ha^e reduced Mir Barkat to impotence, but would have enabled them to recover most of the flocks and herds of camels driven off by Barkat. This was their attitude until we reached Sarzeh on the 30th April. Providentially the list of casualties contained the names of important men ; this materially altered the situation. The Chiefs were now convinced that something material had been effected, and that as we were not going to Sahra- i-gurg, the necessities of the case could be met by punishing the Tahirzais in the plains. 10. A 11 the reports up to date have been to the effect that eight of the enemy were killed. Two of Barkat’s confidential Sidi retainers, Rashid and Rahi, were killed. Karamdad, the head of the Tahirzai clan, lost his son Dost Muhammad, his brother Hussain and his cousin Yar Muhammad. One of the wounded Tahirzais was captured and has been landed at Jask. I recommend his release on recovery. 11. The situation in Mekran before the arrival of our troops was that a large body of Afghans were at Haimani with some thousand camels. Small parties from this centre were either engaged in purchasing arms locally or arranging to receive landings. This was more or less conducted with secrecy owing to the position of Saiyid Khan and Islam Khan, both being in receipt of allowances for the suppression of the arms traffic. This was the state of afiairs in the east. In the west the position was very different. Mir Barkat elated with his apparent success in December at Sarzeh had been steadily scheming a general insurrection against the Persian authorities in the person, of Mir Hajji, the Governor of Biyaban. Having gained the active support of Ghulam Hussain and his Bashkardi following and the promise of assistance from the Afghans in Eanooch, he began his depredations in Biyaban relying on the belief that his success would bring the whole of Bashakard flocking to his standard. Once this was done his powerful position would have resulted in his being re-appointed Governor of Biyaban and gun-running would have been re-established along the coast. Mir Hajji was forced to escape to Jask, villages were pillaged and flocks driven off. Villagers who had suffered came into Jask to crave our protection. The whole country was terror-stricken and in the state of the greatest insecurity. 12. The advance on Bint resulted in depriving Barkat of the Afghan support from Haimani near Panooch as they hurriedly left their encampments here. Belying on their arrival Barkat first of all held positions nearer the coast. As our troops advanced and no Afghans arrived, these had to be abandoned from time to time until an action was forced upon him at Poshaak. 13. The results of these operations are yet to be seen. It may, however, he calculated that the fact of our being able to strike at a considerable distance68 Trill convince botli Saiyid Khan and Islam Khan of our determination to prevent Afghans from settling in these tracts and carrying on the arms traffic. Both the'se Chiefs entertained hopes of Mulla Khair Muhammad being allowed to settle down in their country ; they were informed that this could not possibly he allowed as his only object was to he a centre for gun-running near the coast. As regards Biyaban it is to he hoped that the defeat of Mir Barkat s following will restore security to life and property, and by establishing J Haiii the Persian Governor, a very decided blow will have been dealt at the arms traffic. Beyond the loss inflicted at Poshaak, it has been difficult to inflict any very great loss on the Tahirzai, owing to the very complicated joint ownership in property which prevails with the other inhabita nts of Biyaban, and also to the fact that Mir Hajji was loth to point out their property, intending doubtless to acquire it himself in their absence, and so in som measure to compensate himself and his subjects for their losses. 14 Mir Kambar had asked permission to proceed to Kohistak where he anticipated trouble from the Tahirzai. His object was to collect their cattle before^they had time to drive them off to the hills, and so compensate himse f for two verv serious bullet wounds on his own person received in the recent raids bv these people. Orders for the embarkation of the troops were received on the^Srd May, so that they were unable to visit Kohistak, and no report Las as yet been received of Mir Kambar’s success. 15. In all these disturbances Saiyid Abdul Itahim. Barkat’s chief adherent, has been very prominent, a fact which has fully justified his depoita- tion to India last year. 16 An arms dhow had been wrecked on the Biyaban coast near Sink. Mir Barkat’s men were engaged in taking out the arms, when the arm al of the 1 ships prevented their completing their work. Some of the arms are report- ed to have*been transhipped to two smaller boats “ d 0 “^“two renresentative, however, succeeded in collecting some forty rifles ana two bags of cartridges, which were promptly handed in and thrown into under the instructions of the Officer Commanding the force. 17 In conclusion, I would draw attention to the services of Saiyid Khan, Wdar Nizam of Geh, and Mir Hajji of Sirik, both representing the 1 ersian Government who were of immense assistance in accompanying the troops in their respective provinces. ^ 18 I have &lt;*reat pleasure in recognising the great assistance given me by IS.

In continuation of my predecessor’s letter No. 406, dated the 24th March 1911, I have the honour to address you on the subject of the complaint by the representative of the firm of Messrs. Goguyer &amp; Co. that certain British sailors bearded the firm’s dhow “ Muzaffa” at Kohlab near Charbar. 2 From the enquiries made by my predecessor of the Naval authorities, as promised by him in his letter quoted above, it appears that— (а) The French dhow bore no marks of identification such as would be required by Article 34 of the Brussels Act in latitudes where that act applies. (б) The dhow “ Muzaffa ” which actually had a fair wind to proceed to Charbar was, at the time of the incident, anchored at Kohlab—where it may be noted there is no Persian Customs House, and it is therefore illegal to have communication with the shore. (c) That an officer in command of a boat belonging to one of His Majesty’s ships observing the somewhat suspicious behaviour of the dhow, went alongside to ascertain if she was really a bond fide French dhow or not.64 (d) That the Nahhoda refused to show papers until the officer actually boarded the vessel. {e) That, as soon as the officer had ascertained that the dhow’s papers were really French, he left immediately. (/) That no attempt at search and no detention took place. S Looking at the facts detailed above, I have the honour to inform you that I consider that the action of the Naval officer was, in the circumstances, entirely justified. • * xi,- j • 4 1 would venture to suggest that to prevent incidents of this kind in future to which Messrs. Goguyer &amp; Co. apparently object so strongly, it would be a great advantage if they would take steps to paint clearly on the stern of the vessels, in which they are interested and which are entitled to fly the French flag, provisional identification marks, such as the name o vessel in Latin characters and her registration number. 140 Telegram, No. 442, dated (and received) the 13th May 1911.

I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Foreign , 0 .. v Department telegram,* No. 291, dated the 1st May 1911, on the subject of the text of the Agreement which is to form the basis of the Arms Traffic subsidies to be granted to Sardars Saiyid Khan and Islam Khan. 2. I deduce from the hesitation of the Secretary of State to approve o^ the draft at first submitted by the Military Authorities that he perhaps has douht whether in its present from, the text of the Agreement is consistent with the status of Persia as a Sovereign Srate. If that surmise is correct, I would suggest that the agreement be ostensibly carried out under the auspicies of the Director of the Indo-European Telegraphs (who is also ex-officio Political Officer, Mekran Coast). Mr. Gumbly might sign it on our behalf and it might be paid (as it probably would be in any case) through the Telegraph Office at Charbar. It would be easier to defend thus, if the terms of it became the subject of discussion with the Persian Government. 3. I attach a fresh tentative draft accentuating the above aspect of the Agreement in the first paragraph, and avoiding mention of the Government of India. If this is not on the lines which the Government of India have in mind, I beg that I may receive for guidance a fuller indication of what they consider will suffice. 4. Should the draft be generally approved I request that I may be in formed by telegram. I will then consult the local officers concerned (Captain Cranfurd and Mr. Gumbly) in case they have any modification of detail to suggest. Draft Agreement with Sardars Saiyid Khan and Islam Khan. Whereas the present annual influx of Afghan arms smugglers into Mekran and the contraband traffic in arms along the coast is found to be a cause of lawlessness which results in damage to the Telegraph Line and danger to the Staff: and whereas Sardar Saiyid Khan of Gaih, Paramount Chief of Mekran, and Sardar Islam Khan of Bint, have expressed their readiness to afford their co-operation for the termination of this state of things. It is therefore agreed that so long as the said Sardars shall act up to the conditions detailed below each of them will be granted for a period of 5 years from 1911, an additional allowance of 800 rupees per annum, which will be paid in half yearly instalments through the head of the Tele graph Station at Charbar, on the 1st of April and 1st October of each year, so long as the two Sardars work in harmony and act up to the conditions laid down. The conditions are :— (i) They will at once report to the Officer in charge of the nearest Tele graph Station the arrival or presence of any Afghans in the neighbourhood of their country. (n) They will do their utmost severally and jointly to prevent the passage of Afghans through their territory and will neither protect nor conceal them, nor assist them with transport, provisions, guides nor in any other way.66 (Hi) Thev will not cede, sell or mortgage or otherwise give for occupation to A&amp;s aay part of their territories, nor allow Afghans to obtain a footing in their country as Khalipha Khftir Muhammad sought to do. iiol Thev will take steps to prevent their dependents from becoming \ ei.nts for the purchase of arms and to punish Nakhodas known to hav imnorted cargoes of arms, and will generally warn their subjects against parti cipating in the illicit traffic themselves or associating themselves with or using the vessels of those so engaged. (v) Thev will bring to notice the names of Baluchis known to be aidi g and abcttin-'the traffic and will hand over if called upon, for punishmen y constituted anthority, any of their own dependents found to he so implicated. 148 Telegram P..

From—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department. Be pleased to lay before Bis Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General f India in Council the following report on the present condition of the arms •a£Bc in the Persian Gulf. , , 2 The passage of arms from the Oman to the Mekran and Biyaban ’oast of Persia has practically ceased. A few attempts are still made to mult small quantities of rifles and ammunition across, but they are not of uffieient importance to constitute a danger. o Arms penetrate into the centre of Persia on their way to the Afghan rentier by Uo main routes, one from the Mekran Coast r,a Bint, and the tC froL the Biyaban Coast rid Serzeh, Jaghin and Gurg. The action of he Ernedhionary Force has demonstrated that both routes are unsafe and he result is that, as far as our present information shows, the Afghans have vithdrawn from Mekran and Biyaban entirely.68 L From the Mekran Coast the route lies along the hank of the Rapch river, where abundance of fresh water is to be found at all seasons of the year (as is evident from the fact that large fish were seen by several officers in the upper reaches of the river), grazing is plentiful, access to and from the fertile Bint-Geh valley is comparatively easy, and from that district northwards the route although difficult in parts, is short. The majority of the arms landed on this coast find their way to the Bint-Geh valley, and thence to the interior. 5. During the south-west monsoon landing on the Mekran Coast is very difficult, except at a few more or less sheltered spots under favourable condi tions. It is then that the Biyaban Coast requires the greater attention, as it is easy with a good breeze to slip across the 30 miles of open water from Mussandam in a night. The road runs right along the Biyaban Coast instead of touching it only at certain points, as in Mekran. With the help of the villagers on the Biyaban Coast the arms-runners are able to get away arms and ammunition to the hills without much difficulty before they can be seized, and it is therefore of the utmost importance to keep such a hold over the villagers on the coast as will ensure the refusal of their help to the gnn* runners. Having once reached safety in the mountains the arms are out of our reach, and usually are taken north via Jaghin, Gurg and Nasratabad. 6. The action taken at sea has resulted in the almost complete cessation of attempts to run cargoes, but signs have been evident lately that they would begin again if sufficient support could be obtained on the coast. Afghans came down in considerable numbers to Fanooch and Bint recently, and many of them joined Barkat Khan, who apparently persuaded them that he could arrange to get the arms through, as he had done in former years, in spite of our efforts to stop them. 7. This Chief, Barkat Khan, is actively hostile and he has been taking very strong measures to drive out the nominal head of the Biyaban district, and to bring the villagers that are now under the control of the latter completely into his own power. He hoped that after effecting this he would be able to reorganise the whole scheme of arms-running to his own advantage. The result would have been a repetition of the state of affairs on that coast which prevailed from 1906-10, only possibly worse, because pushed by necessity it would probably have been better organised. 8. Barkat has had considerable success, and several villages, particularly those which lie back from the coast and have not felt our presence, have assisted him with men and in kind. He has also drawn largely on the Bashakard tribe, with whom he is connected by marriage with the daughter of Ghulam Hussain, the Chief of Yakdar. The latter Chief was at one time quite friendly, but since Barkat’s marriage he has been more and more influenced by his son-in-law, until he bas now definitely sided against the British. In fact, Barkat's evil influence is felt principally through his matrimonial connections. The father of his first wife is Mir Haji, who has been put into Barkat’s place, but is quite untrustworthy, and will only side with us as long as we can protect him. Islam Khan is the father of his second wife, and the attitude that he has adopted is largely due to the persuasion of his son-in-law. Ghulam Hussain is the father of Barkat’s third wife. Meshedi Abbas is the father of his fourth wife. At the time Barkat married her, Meshedi Abbas was head of the Persian Customs at Jask, and was in consequence most useful to his son-in-law in conniving at the import of arms, until his removal was brought about towards the end of 1909. 9. From the foregoing it is evident that the central figure in the Mekran and Biyaban districts is Barkat Khan. If he can continue to impress his various fathers-in-law, particularly Islam Khan, as well as the villagers along the Biyaban Coast with the idea that the British can be safely defied, then we must not expect assistance from them, but on the contrary a decided recru descence of activity may be looked for next season, with regular visits from Afghan purchasers. In fact, the market will be reorganised with fresh vigour,and any reduction of naval expenditure will be out of the question. If, on the other hand, it can be shown that disregard of the wishes of Great Britain and support of Barkat Khan entails severe chastisement, then we may hope that he will be discredited, and that those who are now uncertain which side to take will decide to go with us and forbid the entry of Afghans into the district. The authority of the Persian Government does not exist in any shape or form in these districts, and therefore it is not of any use to expect assistance from them. The only time that they have attempted to assist us and agreed to keep Barkat in custody was disastrous, for he bribed his custodian and escaped very shortly after his arrival at Bushire, much to the discredit of British prestige. 10. I therefore decided to take advantage of a cargo of arms bavin 0 * been looted from a Kuwait dhow that had been recently stranded, to land the mili tary force at Sirik, in order to try to recover them, incidentally striking a heavy blow at Barkat and his following. The operations were entirely success ful. Barkat has been driven out of a position that he thought impregnable, with considerable loss. He himself thought discretion the better part of valour’ and was at Sarh-i-Gurg during the action, far from all possibility of harm’ The Bashakard tribe stood aloof as a whole, and even the Tarzeh section, to which Barkat’s father-in-law Ghulam Hussain belongs, deserted him after the fight. The Afghans who had been with him disappeared, and all who have in any way assisted him have felt the hand of the British and seen the troops in their villages. It is hoped that this will effectively discredit Barkat, parti cularly as some of his own personal property has been destroyed as retaliation for the damage that he has done to the villages of those who were friendly. 11. On the Mekran Coast, Saiyid Khan has been loyal as far as be is able and has endeavoured to prevent the Afghans from making his country a base of operations. On the other hand, Islam Khan has not been above suspicion and influenced no doubt by his son-in-law, Barkat Khan, he has been watchin^ the development of events before deciding how to act. Although nominally under Saiyid Khan, he is by far the more powerful personality of the two, and since he ^ controls the coast districts round the mouth of the Rapck river he is an important person in connection with the arms traffic. 12. The expedition which was landed once at Galag in 1910, but which did not advance in force into the Karwan district (Rapch river), shock Islam Khan’s confidence, and since then he has been considering the idea of takin°* a subsidy from us, and of keeping the Afghans out of his territory. Apparently Barkat has been trying to persuade him otherwise, and it is possible that the latter arranged that a large caravan should arrive at Fanooch and Bint iust at the moment when the question of the subsidy was under consideration J in order to bring pressure to bear on him. This the Afghans undoubtedly did whether at Barkat’s suggestion or not, and at the time when the expedition arrived on the coast Islam Khan was wavering, and had almost decided to °*o against us, and to forego his subsidy. It was therefore of great importance to demonstrate to him that he could be struck at without difficulty from the sea and advantage was taken of a reported depot of arms at Joshder, a place north west of Karkindar, and of another at Sarahingi, to advance the whole force through his territory and make a dash for Bint. 13. The column w^as accompanied by Saiyid Khan during the wffiole time but he was frequently under the influence of opium, and w r as of little use! Islam Khan also joined the force, but was rather sceptical of the ability of the troops to do much. After he had accompanied the column on one or two marches, however, and particularly after the dash on Bint he appears to have completely altered his tone. It is now obvious to him that the Bint-Geh valley is open to attack from the sea within about six days from the time of arrival on the coast, and that Great Britain therefore has the power of enforcing her will if it ever should become necessary to do so. 14. The force did not have any fighting in Mekran and Islam Khan therefore, has not had a demonstration of its capabilities in that respect! During the operations in the Biyaban district, however, the troops turned Barkat out of reputed impregnable position with considerable loss to the tribesmen. The position was far worse than anything met with on the way to Bint, and* 70 the necessary object-lesson has been supplied to Islam Khan. The accounts &lt;rf this tight which have circulated through the country have not lost in repeti- tion, and it is hoped that Islam Khan has now come to the conclusion that it will be more to his advantage to accept the British subsidy and loyally act un to its conditions. 15. On the Persian Coast and the coasts of the islands to the westward there has been a persistent rumour that arms are being run to Kishm, Charak, Shiwu, Tahiri, and other places along the coast towards Bushire. The arms for Kishm and Charak are said to come from the Trucial Coast, and for the other places from Katar. It is known that arms go overland from Oman to the Trucial Coast and also by Kuwait dhows to Katar, but we have so far not been able to find any arms in the course of transit from either of these districts to the Persian Coast. Now that the immediate danger on the Mekran and Biyaban Coasts has passed away, I have arranged for a closer watch over the dhows coming from the Arabian Coast inside the Persian Gulf. One Kuwait dhow which has been caught with arms on board will be burnt, and it is hoped that the example will deter others from shipping contraband cargoes. 16. The quantity of arms and ammunition run by these routes into Persia is probably not large, and seeing the enormously increased price of transport, it does not seem likely to be a very paying speculation to attempt to pass them up into Afghanistan. With the exception perhaps of those brought to Kishm most of the rifles landed are said to be absorbed in Persia itself. 17. Large quantities of arms and ammunition are still being imported into Maskat, principally by German steamers, and their destination is a matter of speculation. Probably most of them go by land or land and sea combined to Katar, and thence I am inclined to think that the greater part find their way into the Arabian Peninsula. It seems to me that the Arabs are arming themselves as rapidly as they can, and that they all view the revolt in the Yemen against the Turk with considerable sympathy, and this being so it seems probable that the difficulties which formerly were said to exist over the passage of arms from the coast to the interior have become very much modified. This is pure speculation, but it is the only way in which I can account for the continued import of arms into Maskat. I feel sure that only a small proportion of them reach the Persian Coast, while the remainder disappear entirely from our view. It would appear that the latter must be conveyed into Arabia, where it is probable that a very large demand exists for the most modern type, which is all that is now imported into Maskat. 18. This is not a permanent deflection of the business, and if through any lack of vigilance on our part it again became possible to run the arms across to Mekran, the trade would immediately revive, because the profits by this route are much more considerable than they can be by the long land route to Central Arabia. 19. There is lastly the question of how to deal with Maskat itself. In . 1XT this connection I have nothing to add to the telegram of Colonel Cox, No. 388,* dated the 28th April 1911, addressed to the Foreign Department, with which I thoroughly agree. I am strongly in favour of the second alternative proposed by him, namely, to give the Sultan sufficient financial inducement to make him separate from Ali Musa and his confederates, and afford real co-operation by the introduction of an effective system for the registration of arms import ed and sold subject to friendly supervision by us, or by other similar means. I \ think that this will go a long way towards keeping the arms under control. Every rifle and every box of ammunition coming into Maskat should be registered both on entry and on being re-exported. Arms and ammunition going out of the country by sea to a legitimate destination should be declared, and, if it were found that false declarations had been made for the purpose of smuggling into prohibited areas, a remedy could be devised which would hit the exporter severely. All arms moving coast-wise from one place to another in Oman territory would have to be accounted for under severe penalties, and by this means we might succeed in making it more difficult to smuggle arms out of the country. These measures will not give us complete security, and a71 watch would still have to be maintained, but it would take the form of a preventive service on the coast of Oman itself, rather than a large blockade of a considerable extent of the coast of Persia. 20. In consequence of the success of the operations of the Expeditionary- Force, I propose, as an experiment^ to pay off two launches during June and have ordered them to arrive at Bombay towards the end of May. I would ask that their gun and special fittings may not be removed, so that if it be found next season that we cannot do without them, they may be ready to be sent up again at short notice. This will leave four launches in the Gulf, which I pro pose to keep going during the hot weather. 21. It is possible that towards the end of the year I may be able to recommend steps which will lead to a further considerable reduction of expenses. I cannot make any definite statement on the subject, however, until I have seen Jiow the situation settles down during the hot weather and the early part of next season, but I feel fairly confident that matters will so shape themselves as to enable this step to be taken in November or December. 22. I hope that next season the force that will be sufficient to keep the trade from reviving will be the three subsidised ships, with the “Fox” as Senior Officer, and four launches. It would be necessary that the subsidised ships should be effective vessels, however, with full white crews, not vessels like the “ Lapwing” and “ Bedbreast” w hich carried partly lascar crews. The “ Odin” and *' Espiegie” that have taken the place of the two gunboats are quite satisfactory and suitable for this purpose, while the “ Sphinx”, which does vt-ry well for the work in the Gulf in the hot weather, is generally at Bombay for three or four months during the cold weather refitting, when her place is taken by a more effective ship. 154) No. 89—1462 XIV N., dated H.M.S. “ Highflyer” at Sirik, the 15th April 1911.

At 8-30 p.m. whilst standing down the coast under oars and when about three miles to southward of Sahm and about three and a half miles from the shore, I sighted a badan with her sail lowered. I boarded her and proceeded to search her. The Nakhoda at first denied having any cargo except fish, but a superficial search showed her to be full of rifles and ammunition. The Nakhoda then produced papers purporting to be passes from the Sultan of Maskat. I considered them unsatisfactory, and detained the badan, placing a guard on board her, and took her in tow. 3. At 4 a. m. on Thursday, 6th idem, whilst standing to the southward, and when about five miles to the southward of Sahm and three and a half miles off the coast, I sighted a badan under sail standing to the northward. I waited until she was close and hailed her to lower her sail. She held on, but after two rifle-shots had been fired (the second through her sail) she lowered her sail and I proceeded alongside and searched her. The Nakhoda stated that his cargo was fish, but on removing the upper part of the cargo a quantity of rifles and ammunition was found. The Nakhoda then produced a permit purporting to allow him to trade in arms and bearing the stamp of the Sul ran of Maskat. This I considered to be unsatisfactory, and detained the badan, placing a guard on board her. A light south-easterly breeze was blowing throughout the night. I then proceeded inshore with the two badans in tow, and anchored in shallow water until daylight. 4. On Thursday a Shamal set in, making a lee shore.

I have the honour to refer to Foreign Department telegram* No. S.—311, dated the 13th instant, regarding the • Ssnai No. 137 . Shaikh of Kuwait’s requirements in the direction of arms and ammunition. 2. The Shaikh has generally pledged himself not to let the arms and ammunition, which he gets permission to import, find their way into unauthorised hands. He also expressed verbally, during the recent interview of His Excel lency the Commander-in-Chief and myself with him, his readiness to allow the Political Agent supervisory access to them. That alone would not necessarily regulate the destination of the munitions once they left the warehouse, but I suggest that, if before exportation from Maskat the stocks of the rifles were branded with a special device, which would make them at once identifiable if ‘found outside their legitimate sphere, and if they were issued in Kuwait under arrangements subject to the supervision of our Political Agent, a fairly effective check upon their distribution would be achieved. As regards cartridges, I can only at present suggest that Shaikh Mubarak should be required to produce 75 per cent of the empty cases of those last indented for, each time a fresh indent is presented. 3. I think he could in all probability be got to introduce safeguards on the above lines, but the Government of India will understand that it would be inconvenient for the Political Agent or me to discuss them with him now, if we shall subsequently have to inform him that his indent is considered by the Government of India to be excessive and must be reduced. I therefore recommend that the Government of India first decide arbi trarily what they will consider to be Shaikh Mubarak’s legitimate requirements and that the latter be informed that we will give him immunity for the passage of those amounts if, in consultation with the Political Agent, he will devise and agree to adopt such safeguards on the above lines as shall appear to the Government of India practical and adequate. 4. I presume that the case of the dhow “ Fateh-el-Khair ” referred to in your telegram under reply is that reported in my letter No. 1297 of 22nd May 1910. The Shaikh’s attitude has a good deal improved since then and in the recent case concerning a dhow of the same t serial No. 98. name, referred to in my telegramf No. 370 of 24th April, it has been quite satisfactory. 5. While I fully realise that we should allow political considerations to influence us as little as possible when dealing with practical issues arising out of the arms traffic problem, I think we need to bear in mind at the present juncture that the reports in the vernacular papers regarding Sir Edward Grey’sZ Y rom Secretary of Stats to Viceroy, Foreign Department, 21st March 1910. ^ foreign Secret.

This should not cause any abatement of rigour of blockade, but it must be borne in mind that we have no right even to touch French dhows except in British waters, and, with reference to Admiral’s telegram to Government of India, No. 35, dated 20th February, enclosed m your Foreign Secretary’s letter of 24th February, he should be reminded that orders of 1867 only permit stopping of dhow flying French flag where there is presumption that she is wrongfully flying it.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Please refer to your telegram* No. 255, 16th instant. Just before these seizures? were effecied, a fresh appeal was Senai No. made to Political Agent by Sultan of Maskat regarding old case of the dhow “ Badil, ” which he has always regarded as a grievance. In this connection please refer to paragraphs 3 and 1 of my despatch No. 2530, dated 18th September 1910. On occurrence of present seizures, Sultan telegraphed to me complaining bitterly of Navy’s action, alleging that the dhow had never left his jurisdiction. (I would note, as a matter of tact, that a direct course fiom Maskat to foliar would take vessel east of three-mile limit.) I sent a reply to Sultan that I was making enquiries from the Admiral and Political Agent as to the circum stances and would then communicate with him again. This remains now to be done. If the attitude of the Sultan were reasonably neutral, presumably the present case would be treated according to provisious of telegram from Foreign Department, No. S.—14, dated 12th January 1910; but apparently he is now co-operating with Goguyer and Ali Musa, by allowing the use of his steamer for carrying their arms from one Oman port to another. It therefore seems clear that the position must be reconsidered; and, in my opinion, the present juncture is eminently suitable for so doing. In order to give us time for this, I recommend that I should inform the Sultan that the naval authorities state that the seizure took place on the high seas, that no flags were carried by the dhow s, that nakhodas denied the presence of arms^ and that presump tion that arms were for illegal destination was therefore justifiable. 1 would add that, under the circumstances, I have had to refer the case to the Govern ment of India for orders. Meanwhile, we should continue to detain the arms, hut in view of fact that the dhows have sunk, I think the crews might be released or sent for disposal to Sultan.Having done this, it is necessary that we should decide quickly whether our attitude towards the Sultan is to be friendly or the reverse. Apparently \ there is no longer any hope of suppressing the arms traffic by negotiations with France, and we must decide whether we will proceed in spite of Sultan, if necessary, stopping his subsidy ; or whether we will make it worth his while to cut himself adrift from Ali Musa and Company, and really co-operate with us, by introducing an effective system of registration of sales and imports under our friendly supervision, and by other means. I am of opinion that in our general interests in the Gulf, the latter policy would be best, unless His Majesty’s Government feel in a position simultaneously to assert our position resolutely at all other points in the Gulf where it is now threatened. If my view is endorsed by the Government of India then I suggest that the seizures under reference, coupled with reported use of Sultan’s steamer for conveying Ali Musa’s arms to other Oman ports where we lose touch with them, should be used as occasion for fresh discussion and negotiations with His Highness. Notwithstanding that the arms traffic has been a source of income to Sultan, I am aware that he feels acutely the worry of existing situation and j has for a long time been hoping that the tension would be relieved either by j our coming to an agreement with France or some other means. The decision f of Government as to which alternative policy they intend to adopt towards the I Sultan will regulate the extent to which the tone of our reply to His Highness regarding these dhows is to be concilliatory or the reverse. ‘ I have sent to the Admiral and Political Agent, Maskat, a copy of this telegram by post. 112 Telegram P., No. 44 dated the 30th April 1911.

The enemy were driven out of the sangar and pass after a smart engagement. Their casualties were estimated at twelve of whom five were observed (?), and our casualties were three men belonging to the 104th Wellesley’s Rifies who were dangerously wounded.

This is with • Serial No. 103 . reference to my telegram* No. 43.No. 351, dated Quetta, the 24th (received 28th) April 1911 (Confidential). From— The Hon'ble Colonel C. Archer, C.I.E., Agent to the Governor-General and Chief Commissioner in Baluchistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of an interesting memorandum by Major Y. C. Webb-Ware, Political Agent, Chagai, on' the possibility of blocking the Southern and Western Seistan routes from the Mekran Coast to Afghanistan against the arms traffic. Copy of a memorandum by Major F. C., Webb-Ware, C.I.E., Political Agent, Chagai, showing the roads which arms caravans passing through into Afghanistan by the Southern and Western Seistan Route use and how these routes can be blocked. While on the Saindak-Robat frontier this year I have made enquiries with a view to ascertaining what would be the best lines to adopt, should we ever find it necessary to move troops across the Sarhad frontier to suppress the arms traffic, and the conclusion that I have arrived at is that no^ caravan moving from the south would dare to follow any of the routes which pass through Southern Seistan to the Helmand or through Western Seistan to Lash Jawain, if we were to post a mobile force of 200 rifles at Dahaneh Baghi. Dahaneh Baghi is situated rather north of Nasratabad Sipeh (which is stated to be a miserable place with poor water-supply) and west of Garagu. It lies at a height of over 5,000 feet, possesses a plentiful supply of pure spring water with a good climate and while directly commanding all the routes which lead north from Bampur and pass west of Sarbad, it possesses the additional advantage that it is provided with a Telegraph Office giving connection w ijh Bam and the coast through wffiich news of the approach of caravans could be obtained long prior to their advent in the vicinity. The routes which caravans moving north from the coast now follow are twofold :— The first is that which runs vid Gurg and Nasratabad Sipeh to Baluch Ab and thence through Girdi to the Helmand which it strikes at either Dek Dela or Band-i-Kamal Khan. This is the route which caravans making for the Helmand usually adopt. It may be noted that in case of these caravans some, after leaving Baluch Ab, prefer to march to the Helmand via Beg and the Shelag, a route which is likely to be in some favour this year, as we are daily expecting to hear that the Hamun fceistan is discharging tresh water into the God-i-Zirreh through the Shelag channel. There are several tracks which pass east of Nasratabad Sipeh and debouch on Baluch Ab, but every one of these is directly commanded by Dahaneh Baghi. The second route is that which passes through Gurg, either from Hyder abad or Shorguz, and running along the foot of the hills, west of Nasratabad Sipeh, strikes for Lash Jawain through Nakilu. This is now the most popular route, as arms caravans are never quite certain that a force may not emerge from Robat and fall on them. This road is also directly commanded by Dehaneh Baghi within easy striking distance of which it is. West of Nasratabad Sipeh the country is open but desert of a very for bidding nature, and although the enquiries I have made go to establisu the tact that a track, which is almost unknown and very rarely ever used even by the Baluchis, crosses it yet these enquiries also show that it would be dangerous in the extreme to cross this country except perhaps in winter as it is devoid ot both water, fuel and grazing. We may take it that were a mobile force to be posted at Dehaneh Baghi and the present Kacha detachment retained, the immediate outcome would be that the routes in question which pass west of Sarhad to the Helmand and Lash Jawain would be abandoned by arms caravans. If so, the quesnon would naturally arise as to what routes would then remain open to arms caravans returning from the coast to Afghanistan.-—' 2 t j ^ W ?', c ,e routes open and these are the one which leads through Ladgasht and thence to Helmand via either Nok Kundi and Amir Chah or via Isa Tahir and Manzil, and the route which leads via Regan to Bam and passes thence east of Kabis, a somewhat risky route as it lies within easy striking istance of Kerman. The fort which we are shortly going to build at Sohtagan will effectually protect the first and until this fort is ready it would prove but a simple matter to cover these two routes, should the necessityfor th's step arise hy placing 50 rifles at Merui and another 50 rifles at Mashki Chah Persian troops are notoriously inefficient, but even so it is doubtful whether Afghans would care to trust themselves within the range of the guns which in tlew^vcf K r nr ' an ; 14 raa £ beur s ed that *ere are political difficulties in the way of posting a force in Persian territory. While this is doubtless the case, yet it must be observed that the Persian Government have quite fnrn^ qn P^tect the telegraph Ime in the neighbourhood of Dehaneh Baghi some 3° miles of which was either wholly or partially destroyed last /ear by Afghans, and as no less than fths of the Indo-European traffic now passes along this line, its interruption is a matter of serious import to us. Kacha^rl^r the ^” i0 “, 1 how is that with a detachment at Kacha, from which place sub-detachments could be sent out to Saindak and Rohat, and with another detachment at Dehaneh Baghi and a strong fort at tr 0 fl Hl a wb a b V' ff !i 0tl l e *r ln i eas l! re u at .Kerman, a blow would be dealt afthe arms trade which it is doubtful whether it could withstand. ^ ic^C, Uj l /*'if Foreign OflSce Prew—No. 255—3.5.11—15.38 /# A • o 13MAY191 ... - ' 4 [_ . 88 Telegram P., No. 304), dated (and received) the 20th April 1911.

Barkaban is on the Rapch river, 20 miles above Chakaband, 30 miles from Bint and 9 miles from Kuranadab. The column was joined by Islam Khan at the head of 30 men. On the approach of the force the Afghans retired northward from Joshder, Bint and Fanooch. On the 16th April Colonel Delamain, accompanied by Islam Khan, Saiyid Khan and a number of armed followers, left Barkaban with 90 mounted troops and arrived the next day at Bint, stopped there for ten hours, and having covered 61 miles in 36 hours returned to camp on the 18th. The attitude of the inhabitants of Bint appeared most friendly. The troops are coming back to Galag and were to re-embark on the 2lst April. The force will shortly be landed on the Biyaban coast.

As the Afghans have been purchasing arms locally and are said to have bought at least 300, it is expected that arms will be found at both places.

From—His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Squadron Jask, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Marine Department, Simla. It is reported by H. M. S. “ Espiegle ” that on the 5th, 6th and 7th April respectively she captured three badans, carrying arms and ammunition on board. The captures were effected on the high seas south of Sohar, and they were not flying any colours. The total capture amounted to 200 rifles and 66,800 rounds of ammunition. On being boarded, the Nakhodas in each case stated that they were not carrying any arms, and only when the arms were actually found, did they produce permits for the conveyance of approximately the correct numbers of arms and ammunition, signed by the Sultan of Maskat. As far as I can ascertain these passes are obtained by Ali Khan Bin Musa from the Sultan. The former then fills them up and gives them to the dhows. Of late this traffic has assumed much greater proportions, and may possibly be connected with the arrival on the coast of the Afghans. In order not to push the Sultan too hard, we have not this season interfered with Maskat dhows on the Batineh coast. But I think that pressure should be put on the Sultan by the capture of any vessels found on the high seas, as His Highness does nothing to check the carriage of arms to Sohar and other places on this coast. An j unconfirmed report states that the Sultan’s yacht is being employed to carry arms to Sohar, and neighbouring places. During bad weather the badans all sank, while being towed to Jask, where the crew and arms have been landed.4T 1 i 35 72 Telegram P., dated the 13th April 1911.

The dhow was 1 / / *24 bom d for (?) Kuwait and was met at sea 7 miles east of Khor Fakam port. It had K uwait papers signed by Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait, also papers from Calicut lor Kuwait vid Goa. The dhow had no pass but had on board ammuni tion 60,000 rounds, Mauser pistols 52, and rifles 182, said to be for Shaikh Mubarak. As the Political Agent, Maskat, and the Senior Nayal Officer, Persian Gulf, are not aware of this shipment, the dhow has, pending enquiries, been taken to Jask. Lately Kuwait dhows have regularly been carrying on a trade in arms. I, therefore, propose that, unless a satisfactory explanation can be furnished, cargo, which is not contraband, of owners other than those of the dhow should, at the owner's risk, be landed at Jask and that, to make an example, the dhow should be burnt and the arms destroyed.

The arms might, therefore, be forthwith destroyed in any case. Wiih reference to the dhow, it used to be the practice to ascertain who the owner was, before deciding how to dispose of it. He may be innocent of complicity in the Nakhoda’s action, or, again, he may be a person to whom we have no desire to do injury.

M. S. “Philomel”. f Copy annexed. No. 419, dated Maskat, the 26th March 1911 (Confidential). From— Major A. P. Trevor, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, To —The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to my letter No. 366, dated 11th March 1911, regarding the license to fly the French flag on the boom “ Musaffa ” granted to the firm of Goguyer &amp; Co., I have the honour to inform you that the “ Musafl'a ” left here with a general cargo and passengers for Tank and Charbar on the • Departure reported to Jask by telegram the momillg of the 12th March,^ and arrived ,ame dft y- at Charbar on the 16th idem. She left Charbar on the night of the 19th and reached Matrah in the early hours of the morning of the 22nd March. 2. On the 24th instant I received a letterf from the French Consul for warding a complaint from the represent ative of Messrs. Goguyer &amp; Co. in which the latter protest against the boarding of the dhow off Ras Kuhlab near Charbar on the 15th March. On receipt of this I wired reporting the complaint to the Senior Naval Officer and repeated the telegram to you. I * v L also sent an ad interim replyi to the French Consul, a copy of which is attached. 3. In reply to my telegram the Senior Naval Officer ordered the Officer Commanding the “ Philomel”, whose second cutter had made the inspection, to furnish me with a report of the circumstances. I have to-day received this report§ and have the honour to forward a copy herewith. On hearing that the French dhow “ Musaffa ” had been boarded by Mr. Midshipman Morgan, R.N.R., who was in command of the “ Philomel’s ” second cutter during a portion of his three months* annual course of training, and on learning that Mr. Morgan was to return to his ordinary duties as an officer in the service of the British India Steam Navigation Company by next mail, I asked the Officer Commanding “ Philomel ” to send Mr. Morgan ashore, so that I might record a full statement of the affair. Commander Stanley, R. N., agreed to this, and I have to-day recorded Mr. Morgan’s statement which I submit herewith. It appears clear from it that Mr. Morgan, thinking the behaviour of the dhow somewhat suspicious, boarded her to ascertain if she was really a bond ji &lt;e French dhow or not, and having ascertained that she had genuine French papers he left. In doing this he appears to have exceeded his orders and given the French firm a loop hole for complaint, but no harm was done to any one by his action which was simply “ trop de zele ”. 4. In the circumstances, however, as our officer was in the wrong, and it will probably be necessary to make some sort of apology for his action, I should be glad to receive instructions as to what line should be taken. I beg to enquire whether 1 should inform the French Consul that it is true that an § Letter, dated the 25th March 1911. Ll\officer in command of a boat belonging to one of His Majesty’s Ships seeing the dhow, which actually had a fair wind to proceed to Charbar, ancuor at such a desolate spot as Kuhlab—where it may be noted there is no Persian Customs House and it is, therefore, illegal to have communication with the shore- suspected that the dhow was not bond fide licensed to fly the French flag and therefore boarded her and, on seeing her papers were correct, left; that no attempt at search or anything of that sort was made, and that the officer has been warned not to do it again, &amp;c. Perhaps I might also tell Monsieur Jeannier that I have informed the Senior Officer of His Majesty’s Navy in the Persian Gulf of the names of MM. Goguyer’s dhows licensed to fly the French flag and suggest that, in order to minimise the chance of unscrupulous persons making use of the French flag to cover contraband, it would be advisable, if he sees no objection, for MM. Goguyer to have the name of each of their dhows and the number painted in bold letters on its stern. 6 . If this were done there should be no more confusion, but it certainly seems to me advisable that we should have a right (in the absence of any French men-of-war) to see that any Tom, Dick, or Harry, who likes to buy some red, white and blue cloth in the bazaar and make himself a French flag, can not use it as a screen for running arms across the Gulf. So far no one has done this, but it seems almost certain that, if and when Afghans and gun- running Nakhodas find that the French colours provide complete immunity from search, they will very soon begin to make themselves tri-colour flags and hoist them when they see a British man-of-war, armed launch or boat in their neighbourhood. In these circumstances occasional mistakes by very zealous officers, such as this boarding of the “ Musaffa” by Mr. Morgan, may have their advantages. Consulat de France &amp; Mascate. Mascate, le 24 Mars 1911. Monsieur le Consul et cher collogue, J’ai 1’honneur de vous adresser sous ce pli, en vous priant de vouloir bien , . .. t y donner suite, une plainte de la maison piece join e.

Britannique qui, en rade de Kohlab, pr&amp;s de Tchahbar, auraient violent^ et visitd son boutre Mocaffa, au m£pris du droit des gens (et sp^cialement du droit des gens en pays de capitulations), ainsi que des conventions passdes entre 1’Angleterre et la France au sujet des droits et ddvoirs de leurs croiseurs vis-4-vis des batiments de commerce des deux nations. La maison Goguyer n’ignorant pas que la Perse a prohibd 1* importation des armes de guerre, son boutre “ Mocaffa ” (autoris^ par Paris 4 battre pavilion francais, ainsi que j’ai eu 1’ avantage de vous en informer avant son depart) ne transportait 4 Tchahbar que des passagers (trente) et une cargaison de mais dourah.

Mes ressortissants ayant, d’ailleurs, grde et chargd ce boutre, comme ils le font pour les deux autres, au vu et su de tout le monde, les croiseurs britanniques savaient certainement dans quelles conditions reguli&amp;res naviguait le “ Mo 9 affa ”.

Je vous serais reconnaissant, Monsieur et cher collogue, de vouloir bien recueillir aux fins d’enqu£te les temoignages d^tailles du nakhoda et de 1’dqui- page, qui se tiennent a votre disposition pour le jour et 1’heure qui vous conviendront le mieux.4 Dated the 25th March 191]. From— Commander Norman L. Stanley, Commander-in-Command, H. M. S. “ Philomel ”, To—The Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat. In accordance with orders received from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, I have the honour to forward the enclosed report on the hoarding of French dhow in Chahbar West Bay, by Mr. C. W. F. Morgan, Midshipman, Royal Naval Reserve, who was in command of “Philomers” cutter at the time. Dated the 18th March 1911. From—C. W. F. Morgan, Esq., Midshipman, Royal Naval Reserve, To—The Officer Commanding, H. M. S. u Philomel'. In accordance with your orders I have the honour to report that Tuesday, the 14th March, whilst in command of the second cutter, lying on my heat in Charbar West heat, I sighted a dhow rounding Ras Kuhlab, ing the French colours, and come to an anchorage two miles north of that point. I got under way and went alongside her and asked to see her papers. The Nakhoda at first refused to show them to me. I then went on board and he at once brought them up. Seeing that they were correct I proceeded hack to my beat. He informed that he was bound from Maskat to Charbar with passengers and cargo. Seeing this dhow come to an anchorage in Charbar West Bay, I thought she might be a dhow flying the French colours to avoid being searched. He proceeded to Charbar the following morning. Statement of Mr. C. W. F. Morgan, Midshipman, Royal Naval Reserve, in Command of Second Cutter of H. M. S. “Philomel,' on solemn affirmation, states— I am a midshipman of the Royal Naval Reserve nnd have been attached to H. M. S. “ Philomel ” for the last three months for the annual course of training. On the 14th March, I was in command of the 2nd cutter in Charbar West Bay, being on the Charbar West beat; when about 11a.m. I saw a dhow rounding Ras Kuhlab I was lying near the shore at about 3 or 4 miles to the north of Ras Kuhlab when I saw the dhow. The wind was about north-west, and I bore down on the dhow with a view to inspecting her. The dhow came to anchor about 2 miles north of Kuhlab point, and as I approached I saw she was flying French colours. I took the cutter alongside and asked for the Nakhoda. One man first said he was Nakhoda, but after wards corrected himself and brought forward another man and said he was the Nakhoda. I asked the latter if he would show me the dhow’s papers. He said no. I thereupon stepped on board the dhow and again asked him to show them. The Nakhoda (the 2nd man) then showed me the papers, and finding them all correct, and having ascertained where the dhow had come from and where she was going to, I left. At Ras Kuhlab where the dhow anchored there is practically nothing in the nature of habitation or cultivation. Two small huts have been put up latelv. The action of the dhow in anchoring in such a desolate spot instead of going on to Charbar appeared to me to be very curious, not to say suspicious; this coupled with the fact that for two or three days some men with donkeys had been loitering about on top of the cliffs, without apparently having anything to do there, made me suspect that the dhow contained* arms, °and *that the French flag had been flown as a ruse to avoid being searched. The wind too was quite fair for the dhow to go straight on from Has Kuhlab to Charbar. 1 therefore boarded her with a view to ascertaining if she was a bona fide French dhow, and imme diately on ascertaining this fact I left. The boat’s crew were of course armed as is usual and I had a revolver on. When I went on board I took my5 revolver out of the holster. The man who first told me he was Nakhoda was an elderly man ; the second man was a small, slight keen-featured individual with a heard dved red and bushy eye brows. When I went on board I stood at the break of the poop, and the old man sat in the same place as he was when I came alongside. The man with the red heard was not visible, but he was evidently down below the poop, as after about ten minutes he came back with the papers. ^ Fairfax Morgan. Read over and admitted correct and signed by Mr. Morgan before me. Maskat ; The 26th March 1911. } A. P. Trevor, Major, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Maskat. Q.—Did you threaten any one with your revolver ? A.—No. I only took it out of the holster when I got aboard. Q.—Had you an interpreter ? A. No. I spoke to the Nakhodas in Hindustani which they both under stood. Q.—Did any of your boat’s crew go aboard ? A—No. I had a man at the maxim as a precaution. The crew of the cutter stood to their arms except two men, one of whom was hold ing on at the bow and another at the stern. q. Did you use any threatening or abusive language to the Nakhoda or any one else ? A.—No. Q,.—What did you do after visiting dhow and what did she do ? A —I returned to my former position close under the cliff about B miles north of Kuhlab. I had a watch kept on the dhow, which staved off Kuhlab the rest of the that day and the night. Ihe morning watch reported that she left at 5 a.m. the next morning, the 15th for Charbar. Q.—What did you consider your duty in regard to a dhow flying the French flag ? A.—I considered that, in view of the suspicious circumstances mentioned in my statement, I was justified in going aboard to see if the dhow was a proper French dhow and not a local dhow masquerading. I was quite Rware that, if the dhow proved to be French, I could not search her or seize anything on hoard. I considered that, if I went to Charbar to report arrival of the dhow, my departure would give the dhow, if she was an arms dhow masquerading as a 1 rench dhow, the opportunity she desired for landing any arms she might have aboard. Charbar is about 11 miles from Kuhlab, and in a loaded cutter it would take about five hours with a fair wind and probably longer to get back, not to mention the time required in getting a message through to the ship. Q.—Did you report matter ? A. Yes I reported the matter to the Officer Commanding, H. M. S. “Philomel”, the following afternoon, and made an official state ment to him. Ch. Fairfax Morgan.

Poli tical Agent, Maskat, and I consider pro posal to deport Ali Musa impracticable. He is a subject of Maskat, and it would be necessary for us to act through the Sultan, who would not consent to expel his own subject and banker, while Goguyer and other foreigners cannot be touched. Moreover, the deportation of Ali Musa, if it is to be efficacious, must be accompanied by the confiscation of his store of the arms. I can have the Sultan sounded if you wish, but Political Agent has already expressed the opinion that Sultan would not for a moment listen to proposal. With regard to Ali Musa’s agents. If Gregson knows who they are and could produce them, they could presumably be deported from any Mekran port, but their places would at once be filled by others.?rojn - His ''xcclleiscj the Oo«ks€B 1sr-in-Chief, To - The -ecretarj to the lovsriwnent of India, Marine Dspftrtxont, l^o• 28.

The Director, ■ oyal Indian Marine, explains that his reason for stating that the Northbrook* and 'Hardinge' could not convey the expedition was that these two vessels could not carry the required nuisfoer of niulos, and yet keep available the 1C per cent fetalis. v .'y sug estion is that 2T mules only be carried on each ship, which will be sufficient. Should any further transport be required it can be obtained it &amp;ekran. Hitherto there has been no difficulty in getting a small number of camels in Mekran, and probably, at short notice, 50 at least could be obtained. In my opinion, it will be good policy to hire some transport in the country.

A copy of my letter addressed to the Admiralty is also being sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Commander-in-ChiePs Office, Bombay, 6th February 1911. No. 88—1462 XIV-K. Sir, With reference to my telegram No. 221 of 4th December 1910, reporting the departure from Maskat of a dhow under French colours with 2,000 arms on board, be pleased to lay before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the following report in regard to the proceedings of this vessel. 2. The dhow, named “ Fath-el-Khair ” and belonging to Messrs. Goguyer et Cie, left Maskat on 21st November 1910, reported to be bound for the Arabian coast of the Gulf and to have 2,000 arms on board, with ammunition and general merchandise. It was stated that she had received on board Afghan owners of the rifles. From this it was inferred that the arms were not being taken up the Gulf in the ordinary course of trade, but that they were already sold to Afghans and that the dhow was being used solely to carry the arms through the blockade and land them on the coast. Directions were accordingly given that she was to be kept in sight by one of His Majesty’s Ships in order that the necessary steps might be taken should she land tne arms. 3. On 10th December the dhow anchored at the entrance to A1 Bida on the Katar peninsula, and remained there until 12th December, H.M.S. Espiegle ” also being present. Two Afghans were seen to be on board. She then proceeded to Wakra followed by “ Espiegle ”, but was requested by the f Shaikh of Doha to leave that anchorage. The Shaikh stated that he would seize the arms if landed, as some might be for the Bedouins. On the 17th December the French dhow accordingly weighed and proceeded to sea. 4. On 30th December she anchored at Khasab, having previously stopped at Halul Island for shelter. She remained at Khasab until 12th January, when she left for Maskat and arrived there on the 14th idem. 6. It was reported that the return of the dhow to Maskat was due to a mutiny on the part of the crew, who refused to proceed further. Since her arrival a letter of complaint has been received by the Political Agent from the French Consul at Maskat. I annex a copy of the Political Agent’s letter enclosing that from the French Consul and of the Senior Naval Officer’s reply, in which I fully concur.6 . I personally saw the dhow on two occasions when I wished to commu nicate with the “ Espiegle,” and I feel sure that nothing was done to hinder the former m moving from place to place. It is probably true that, as stated by the ^akhodaot the “ Fath-el-Khair,’ , it was the presence of the Espiegle which caused the inhabitants of Wakra to order away the chow as they did not wish to become embroiled with us, but force was not threatened or used, and I do not consider that any grounds for damages thereby arise. 7. It would have been quite fatal to the success of the blockade if this attempt upon the part of Messrs. Goguyer &amp; Co. had succeeded, as the Fath-el-Khair would probably have been chartered afterwards by every Afghan who wished to take rides across the Gulf. . S * The arms now remain on board the French dhow at Maskat, and it is reported that she is to take them to Sohar. 9. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c., E. J. W. Slade, Rear-Admiral. No. 109. Sir, British Agency and Consulate, Maskat, 22nd January 1911. I have the honour to forward herewith, for your information, a copy of a letter, together with its enclosures, which I have received from the French Consul regarding the proceedings of Llis Majesty’s Ships during the recent voyage of the dhow “ Fath-el-Khair” belonging to MM. Goguyer &amp; Cie A copy of my reply in also annexed. 2 . I should be glad to have the facts of the case, and any suggestions you may desire to make as to the lines on which I should reply. I would particu- lariy desire to know whether you think it best to controvert the facts set forth by MM. Goguyer, or to confine the reply to a statement that His Majesty’s Ships had perfect right to be at Katar or Khasab or anywhere else in the Gulf and a request to the French Consul to formulate something more specific. I have, &amp;c., A. P. Trevor, Major y P olitical Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul^ Maskat. Captain A. T. Hunt, C.S.I., R.N., Senior Naval Officer, Bersian Gulf, H. M.

Trevor, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul I have the honour to forward you, herewith, a complaint on the part of Ah 3 fll r“ p f n'? aCt , i , 0n j ° £ some British crl 'isers towards their dhow ( ‘boutre ) “ hath-el-Khair” flying the Trench flag-action which impeded the navigation of tins dhow to the extent of causin'- her to be in danger of foundering and of running out of provisions and water and which prevented her from trading in districts where, until now, trade has been open. As no agreement between our respective Governments authorises such conduct towards a French vessel, lam compelled to ask you to be ^ood enough to deal with this fair request in the way it demands, and to take'the necessary steps to prevent a recurrence of such proceedings.3 r I (Translation.) Dated Maskat, the 17th January 1911. From— Mons. A. Elbaz, To—The French Consul, Maskat. I have the honour to bring to your notice that our dhow (*‘ boutre**) ** Fath-el-Khair”, which left on 21st November with merchandise for the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, has just returned to Maskat without having been able to unload her cargo at the port of consignment on account of the machinations of the English warships. Here are the facts, just as they happened and just as they were stated to me by the Nakhoda and the second-in-command of the dhow :— “ After we left Maskat, and without our knowledge as to what to ascribe this signal honour, we were escorted all the passage by some half a score of British warships, which relieved one another from time to time but, however, without ever once leaving us alone. They permitted all other native craft to go |by undisturbed, interesting themselves only in the movements of ours. “ Although moved (touches) by such a distinction, the honour did not fail to cause us some anxiety, for these ships pressed us so narrowly that the voyage became a perilous one for us. “ Our dhow was continuing on her course towards the Gulf, when at some miles from Katar, our inseparable companion shot ahead in the direction of that town, and there she waited for us. “ Scareely had we arrived when this procedure was explained, for the inhabitants ordered us to go away since the English were threatening to bom bard the town if we were allowed to land our merchandise, and in their terror they begged us to hasten our going. “ In spite of a very strong gale blowing at the time, we left without even having been able to replenish our supply of water, for the inhabitants, threatened once more by the English, would not allow the men told off for the work to carry it out. “ The sea getting up more and more, navigation became risky and we considered it advisable to reverse our course so as to seek shelter at Khasab, which place is—beyond dispute—a town in Oman. “ Our faithful companion was ever at hand—she never left us for a moment—and kept so near to us that we had to monoeuvre to avoid an over rough fondling and one we were more willing to let pass by us. We remained at Khasab three days without being able to land. “ The inhabitants told us that they feared they would suffer the fate of the people of Eebai, and begged us to leave. The English ship, being also invited to weigh anchor, her Captain replied—* I am here to watch this dhow and I will only leave with her’. “ We must add that, in the neighbonrhood of the island of Zerko, we were insulted by an officer of the ship ‘ Alert * who obstructed us on our way.” In consequence of the foregoing I have to beg M. le Consul to be good enough to forward our complaint to his colleague, M. le Consul for England. We protest against this attitude on the part of English ships in the face of a dhow flying a French flag and we demand an explanation of the extra ordinary honours which have been paid to us against our wishes, as well as to be indemnitied for the losses occasioned which we estimate at Es. 60,000 (sixty thousand rupees).

Trevor, Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Maskat, To—The French Consul, Maskat. 4 I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of yesterday forwarding a claim for the firm of Goguyer &amp; Co., in which their represen tative alleges that the firm has sustained loss through the action of His Britannic Majesty’s ships.I shall do myself the honour of replying in due course after making the necessary enquiries. Sir, H.M S. ** Fox ” at Maskat, 30th January 1911. In reply to your letter No. 109 of 22nd January 1911, forwarding a letter of complaint from Messrs. Goguyer &amp; Co., I have the honour to inform you that on full enquiry I find there is no foundation for the various statements in that letter, except that the dhow was met with by several of our ships, hut the navigation of the sea is free to all and our cruisers cannot be confined to those waters not visited to the “ Fath-el-Khair ”. 2. As regards the other complaints, the facts are as follows. 3. The French dhow “ Fath-el-Khair ” has not been impeded in any wav by H. M.’s Ships. When met with, the International Regulations for prevent ing collisions at sea have been invariably complied with. 4. The discharge of her cargo was not interfered with at all. 5. No threat of any sort has been made by H. M/s Ships against any town or village in Katar. 6 . No communication has passed between the Wali of Khasab and H. M/s Ships for several months. 7. H. M.

Goguyer &amp; Cie. regarding the proceedings of His Britannic Majesty’s ships in respect of the dhow “ Fath- el-Khair ” flying the French flag.' 9MP 2 My enquiries show that it is the fact that the “ Fath-el-Khair ” met with several British ships-of-war, but that the latter did nothing to impede the navigation of the former, having invariably complied with the International Regulations for the prevention of collisions at sea. In regard to the frequent meetings between British cruisers and the “ Fath-el-Khair”, I beg to observe that the movements of the former at sea are not restricted, and cannot be con fined to waters not visited by the latter. I may add that I find from my enquiries that the discharge of the cargo of the “ Fath-el-Khair ” was never interfered with at all by His Britannic Majesty’s ships, nor did any British ship do anything to prevent the dhow from obtaining provisions and water. As regards the specific allegations made in the letter of the representative of MM. Goguyer, I beg to inform you that no threat of any sort has been made by any British cruiser against any town or village in Katar, and no communication has passed between the Wali of Khasab and any British ships- of-war for several months; I may add that H.B.M. Ship “ Alert ” has never been within 100 miles of the island of Zirko. In the circumstances and in view of the above facts I trust you will agree that the representative of MM. Goguyer has been misinformed and that the firm has no grounds of complaint against His Britannic Majesty’s ships. 1.
