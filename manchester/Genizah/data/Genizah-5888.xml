On the right margins there are semi-Hebrew words in mirror-writing and reversed to the main text. It seems to be a translation of Genesis into Judaeo-Arabic. The bottom part of the page seems to be cut-out in quite a straight line, although the stamp and the words seem to be broken. That is the outcome of this fragment having been glued to another fragment (Ar. 201-1, Ar. 201-2) to create one larger fragment: the stamp and writing when joined together make one comprehensive manuscript. It appears that another fragment, in Hebrew characters, was glued or stuck to this fragment, of which only small pieces were left.</dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:type>Manuscripts</dc:type><dc:title>Arabic notes</dc:title></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
