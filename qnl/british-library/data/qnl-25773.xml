Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith, in original with 3 enclosures, a letter addressed to you by Sardar Haidar Quli Khan Kabuly whose pension formed^tiu^ subject of my letter to you No .478/8/1/1 of tftTtsUi October 1936. 2 . As the Indian pension^ 2b0 Rupees monthly paid to Sardar Haidar Quli Khan was originally granted in 1907 (Pension Order No. 652 of the 28th October 1907), the present purchasing power of the pension has declined very considerably during the past 3 years owing to the increase in the cost of living here, I feel sure that you will readily understand the pensioner's request for the revision of his pension, which I strongly reco^end for your favourable / consideration. 3. The pension at present received by 3ardar Haidar Quli Khan is in recognition of the eminent services rendered by his late father, Sardar Nur Mohammed Khan Qizilbash to Field Marshal Lord Robert in the Afghan campaign of 1887. No pension has been granted to Sardar Haidar Quli Khan in connection with the very useful services rendered by him to the British and Indian Military forces which were operating in Iran during 1915/1919; nor has any monetary compensation been granted to him for the very heavy financial losses which he suffered during 1915/1919. \ 4 . Owin^ to the heavy losses which he and his late brother Jafar Quli Khan were unfortunately the victims, the Government Accountant General, of Central Revenues, Simla. 'enclosure m india foreign secretly- v rtmR o , N 3°0 ^7 26-7-1939of India was asked, during 1921/1926, to grant the petitioners financial assistance. The Government of India however, expressed its inability to make any monetary grant to them (see letter No. D.2481-N dated the 23rd August 1926 addressed by the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India to HJlI’s Minister at Tehran). Despite the Government of India’s refusal to grant any compensation to the petitioner, I trust that, at least, the services he has rendered and the losses he has suffered will be taken into account when the question of increasing the pension which he is at present receiving is under examinati on. 5. Copy of this despatch has been forwarded for information, to H.M f s Minister at Tehran. I have the honour to be, Sir Your most obedient servant (Sd.) J .R. Vaughan RusbbU H. B. M. Consul.Kerman shah. Iran. June 7th f 1939. My Lord, I beg most respectfully, to enclose herewith copy of documents which are self explanatory relating to my past valuable services to His Majesty’s Grovernment, services which have remained so far, without any recognition or reward. For your information I beg to bring briefly to your knowledge that I narrowly risked and endangered several times my life in the services of His Majesty’s Government, as evidenced by the enclosed documents, and I suffered heavy losses during the world-war,- to an amount of Rials 700 000 as all my real estates and my houses were looted and completely ruined. For these losses I did not receive any compensation whatever. I beg to submit this present petition of mine to request you to take into consideration my faithful past services and grant to me a regular pension as a reward and in order that I may live in gratitude to His Majesty’s Government for the remainder of my life. I am an old man of 66 years age and can do nothing; the small pension which I am receiving does not take into account the services rendered by me and the losses which I have suffered but merely recognises the services rendered by my Accountant General, Central Revenues, Simla. u.f.s. British Consulate, Kermanshah.&lt;3 2 - my late father, Sardar Nur Mohammed Khan. The pension does not cover even one quarter of my unavoidable daily living expenses, as, the cost of living in this country has considerably increased since the past five years* I am confident that I deserve your good offices and your favour able consideration for this humble request of mine. I have the honour to be, my Lord, With great respect, Your most obedient humble servant (3d.) Sardar Haider yuly Khan Kzilbash Cabuly.c opy . Consulate Kermanshah, April 30th, 1919 9 To H.B.M’s Minister, TEHRAN. Memorandum Reference your Memorandum No. 8 dated April 15th 1919, and Sir P.Cox’s private letter of February 8 th# The case of the two sons of the late Sardar Nur Mohammed Khan Qizilbash, Sardar Haidar «uli Khan and Sardar Jafar Quli Khan commonly known as the Cabuli uardars of Kermanshsh, is deserving of consideration. 2 e The older of the two brothers is a pensioner of the Indian Governnuent and a.s such they are under British protection. When the Turks advanced on Kermanshah in 1915, it will be remembered that Mr* MacDouall H.B.M.Consul had to evacuate the place* The two brothers stayed on in Kermanshah and at great risk supplied information to Mr. MacDouall and furdered pro-British propaganda to such an extent that their arrest was contemplated by the Government of Nizam-us-Saltaneh. The return of the Russian troops prevented this arrest, but on the second evacuation of Kermanshah the two brothers accompanied our representative to Kasvin. During their absence their property in Kermanr shah ar;d in two outlying estates of Tawalali and Kalah Shah Shaneh were made an especial object of the attention of the Turks. I attach their claim in original which amounts to Krano 711 042 and their claim of Krans 61 806 on account of servants of their household. This latter claim might fairly be included in the Sardars claim a,s they axe responsible for re-imbursing their retainers. I have seen their house on occasion when I have visited the Sardars and I do not consider their chaim for damage exorbitant*2 - 4 . To add to their misfortunes their lease fell through of the estate of Tawalali which they had held for many years and on which they had made improvementa costing a certain amount of money. The Kabuli Sardars applied to the Ministry of Finance in Tehra’i and obtained a renewal of the lease for 5 years while the Finance Department of Kermanshsh gave a lease for 5 years to the lv-oawen*ul*Molk here. Lack of communication between Tehran and Keman- sheh due to the state of war then existent probably account for this double lease of the same estate. X have succeeded in gaining possession for the Barbara of this estate from the Persian New Year f fist Moxch 1919 This leaves them another 3 years to enjoy the property. It would be a great boon to the Sardars if you could obtain for them an extention of this lease ior a iurtner period of 5 years from the Ministry of Finance at Tehran. nith this document in their possession their financial position would be much strengthened# 5 # During the past year, since I have been here the Sardars have rendered me much assistance in giving me valuable information. They have also have given me many documents of Prince Sulaiman Mirza who was arrested by us now deported early in 1917. These many in cypher, were sent by me to Civil Commissioner Bagdad and clearly show in what close communication he was with the Germans# 5 # This change of position from affluence to comparative property is sad and they are much encumbered with debt. This is largely due to their losses as mentilned| above. I have given them assistance to the extent of 300/ Tomans to tide over a difficulty in January and I hope to recover possession for them a pro perty near Harsin of which they have taken the lease but not entered into possession owing to the enmity of Azam- The question. us-Saltaneh.-3- 7 . The question of obtaining a grant of land for the Sardars in Mesopotamia will be put up if it is definitely settled that Mesopotamia, will remain under our adminis- trative controlo q, I consider a monetry grant of 2000/ Tomans and the extention of the lease referred to in para. 4 above would tide over the Sardars until their losses at Turkish hands are repaid. It would add to their personal satis faction if these favours were conferred by the Ministry in Tehran. The unavoidable delay in submitting this note is due to my absence from Kermanshah and to the list of claims of the Kabuli Sardars only having been received to-day. Sgd. J.L.R.Weir Major. H.B.M's Consul, Kermanshah. \COPY . During my enforced absence from Kermanshab*Sardar Haidar Quli Khan Cabuli and his brother Jafar Quli Khan, have rendered invaluable services, having kept me iniormed of all that occured at Kermanshah and secretly arranged a pro-ally propaganda, at some risk to themselves. They have also continued to assist in obtaining news since my return. Sgd. WoMacDouall Kermanshah, Consul, April 26th, 1916* Sardar Haidar Quli Khan Cabuli a pensioner of Indian Government was of great use to us last year, both in my absence from Kermanshah and after my return. On this account and having heard that last year the enemy intended to arrest him which was prevented by the arrival of Russian troops he fled from Kermanshah with us leaving behind his crops from land farmed from the Persian Government and a village owned by his wife, I therefore consider that he is entitled to all considera* tion on the part of British officials - as until his return to Kermanshah it is impossible for him to make a list of his losses, he is at present unable to present a claim, Sgd. f.MacDouall Kazvin, H.B.M.Consul for Hamdan November SOth, 1916, formerly for Kermanshah, British Consulate Hamdan, Kazvin, October 7th, 1916.
