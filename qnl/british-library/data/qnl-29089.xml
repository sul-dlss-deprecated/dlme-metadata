The Resident showed me correspondence on his files which indicated that Dr. Rosnan was not a person to v/hom support c&lt; uld suitably be given and that the Mission to which she alleges that she is affiliated is of a somewhat nebulous character. The Resident surr •sted and I $ agreed, that general policy should be to support the American 'issions which is known to us and to discourage the incursion of other . issions about which we know little or nothing. The Resident was also informed that Dr. hosman had obtained a H No Objection Certificate” from the Sultan for an American mission ary nurse to accompany her to Saham, although her application for this had previously been rejected by the Political Resident. The Resident mentioned this matter to the Sultan and pointed out that there were considerable dangers in the issue of No Objection Certi ficates in this matter as it would he open to persons to forge such documents. The Resident also advised the Sultan to support only ' the American .fission whose activities had been shown through a long'period of years to be unobjectionable. The Sultan made no definite comment on this advice except to say that Dr. Nosman had nqt’informed him of the previous application to the Resident for the No OTjection Certificate. C-c.-R.J.h 13.12.45I told Mis Highness that I understood from the Consul that A Dr. Hosman and a nurse named Miss Barter were on their way out to Muscat from India and said that I Believed they had obtained their visas on No Objection certificates granted by him. He replied that she had approached him earlier in the year and that he had in fact given her a No Objection Certificate for herself and for her nurse. I enquired whether she had informed His Highness that we had already refused her application and he replied in apparent surprise that she had said no tiling whatever about tais. I replied that this gave point to our view that she was an undesirable person and that her action in not informing him was definitely underhand. I told him that my view was that, since we had the Arabian Mission on this coast, we should canalize American Missionary effort through them and only grant visas to persons sponsored by them. Unless we did this we could not be certain whom we mere getting, and as he was probably aware certain American missionaries in India had been extremely tiresome. In Bahrain they had j^ut forward tae names of persons of German origin, and it v\as iiOt always ^possible to check the antecedents in every case. I added that he could of course do what he lixed and admit anyone he chose to his territories — though he incurred a heavy responsibility in doing so — but that I felt that the form in which No Objection Certificates had been granted was not very happy as it could easily be f orged. Our own No Objection Certificates were authenticated in a special way, but there was really nothing now to prevent anyone forging His Hi^iness 1 name and persuading a Consul to grant a visa for Muscat. His Highness seemed impressed by this argument and appeared to agree generally with rzy views. I took the opportunity to draw his attention to the very inferior type of passports the Muscat State were now issuing and suggested that when o portunity offered they should get better ones printed by V/aterlow or some reliable printer. He said he would do this and that he would communicate with the Consul on the sub. ect. The exist ing Muscat passports can, of course, be forged very easily and the holder would then be able to enter the British Empire with it. An extract of this paragraph should be placed on the Muscat Passport Pile and a copy of this note should be sent to the Political Agent at Muscat. ' 4 Initialled G.P. 1 S/ 12 AS No. 1C16-S.

Barpeta on the 21st and proceeded on to Basrah in the same ship, together with Mr. D. Dykstra, Missionary of the American Mission. They are attending a Conference at Basrah called by the Mission authorities. During Mr, Dykstra^‘absence the Muscat Government have issued instructions prohibiting the re-opening of the Mission School.-rV 5V Li, D.Q* No* C*/617 ■ 6A Political Agency# Unseat. 8th December 1947. r Please refer to your Hemorandum No. 1960-3 dated the 15th November 1947 on the subject of closing the American Mission School• 2. I understand that the first steps were taken last year when, during the absence of Mr. Pykstra in America on leave, the State Issued a notification prohibiting the opening of Schools and dispensaries without authority from the Government. On his return from America, Mr. Dykstra re-opened his School which consists of about 20 pupils, mainly children of the Mission Hospital workers and assistants. For a short time no question was raised. It then chanced that a mason, a British subject, working in the Mission compound took his son away from the Saidiyeh School and installed him in the Mission School. The headmaster of the Saidiyeh School apparently resented losing his pupil and reported the matter to the Minister of Interior who sent for the mason and demanded to know why he had removed his son from the State School and put him in the Mission School. The mason, apparently a man of independent mind, appears to have told the Minister of the Interior that he was a British subject and would send his son to School v/here he liked, thereupon the Minister of Interior thrust him into gaol, and the Consulate had to intervene and get him out (no report was made to the Consulate at the time that the trouble started over the question of the boy^ schooling). After this incident, the Sultan's Secretary wrote to Mr. Dykstra asking him when, and on what authority, he had opened his School and referred him to the notification pullished last year. Mr. Pykstra replied that he had not been sent a copy of this notification before and that in any case his school was not a newly opened school, that it had been going for many years, and that amongst others who had benefitted by education in the school / was The Hon'ble Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.2 was Mr. Jamali himself. It appears that Mr. Jamali told Mr. Pykstra while regretting the necessity to close the school, Mr. Pykstra would have to conform to the public notification in this respect and obtain the permission of the Government before he opened the school. I understand that the Mission have written to the Sultan about the matter and since they do not wish to create any unnecessary ill will and fuss, have closed the school, pending the Sultan's reply. In the meantime, Mr. Pykstra is setting his pupils home tasks and correcting and advising them as opportunity occurs. Though the notification refers also to the opening of dispensaries, no action has yet been taken against the Mission Hospital or Nurse Mary's Hospital in Muscat. I believe that the Mission are planning to bring out at least two new nurses very shortly and otherwise increase their staff. They are therefore anxious to settle the matter quietly with the Sultan if possible, rather than come to an open clash with the local authorities.* INDIA OFFICE RECORDS Mfcfr 9570 MICROFILM 1</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000359_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/146</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000359</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/146</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 6/1 Foreign Interests: American Mission at Muscat'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1944/1947</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-05-29T22:21:57</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (24 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 26; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence concerning the following:An application made for travel documents and permission to return to Muscat from India by Dr Sarah L Hosman of the American Mission and a nurse named May Edna BarterThe enforced closure of the American Medical Mission school by the Muscat authorities.The correspondence in the file is primarily between officials at the Political Agency in Muscat and the Political Residency in Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian Mission</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000359#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
