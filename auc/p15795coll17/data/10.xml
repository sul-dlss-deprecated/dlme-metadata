Edward Dirks served as an AUC Trustee from 1955 to 1972, and as Chairman of the Board from 1959 to 1969.  He outlines the contacts through which he became associated with AUC and elected as trustee, and describes issues of concern to the board (chaired by Douglas Horton) in the 1950s like the property near the pyramids that had been acquired earlier for the campus location, and the university’s financial deficit (which was covered by trustee donations). Developments under President Raymond McLain are mentioned, like the university self-study and Creswell Library acquisition. Dirks became chair at a time of transition, when many long-associated trustees were nearing departure, and he strove to build a more broadly-based board beyond those circles (adding members like James Barco who brought in President Thomas Bartlett), and one more connected to Egypt (through visits and holding board meetings in Cairo). Dirks outlines major developments at the university in the late 1950s and 1960s, such as getting U.S. government funding, AUC’s greatly increased budget, and the launch of new academic programs like solid state science while others were phased out (school of education, journalism). Also addressed are AUC’s resilience through turbulent political times, impact in Egypt, and role in international education.
