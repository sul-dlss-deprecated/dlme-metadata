There is an update on the situation between Carem Caun [Karim Khan] and Meer Mahanna [M카r Muhanna], with news that former is at Shustar [Sh큰shtar] and will soon reach Bunderick [Bandar Rig]. Also discussed is the difficulty of using British weight systems in Bushire and the relevance of Article VI of the grants given to the Company by Sadoo Caun [Sadiq Khan] in 1763.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024189854.0x000060#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
