From, To, COLONEL SIR W. L. MEREWETHER, k. c. s. l &amp; c. b. Commissioner in Sind. His Excellency the Right Honorable SIR W. R. SEYMOUR V. FITZGERALD, g. c. s. l, Governor and President in Council, BOMBAY. Commissioner's Office, Kurrachee, 2i)th August 1870. Right Honorable Sir, It is with great regret I have to submit to your Excellency in Council the accom panying papers, relating to matters which have recently occurred on the Frontier of Upper Sind. 2. I have already in my letter No. 52, of the 26th January last, placed on record, that I entirely dissented from the views Colonel Phayre held, as regards our position towards, and relations with, the Khelat State. I had hoped that what .was written in the above letter, with the remarks I had made on Colonel Phayre's narrative of events (copies of all these were immediately given to him) would have been sufficient to have removed from his mind the totally wrong impressions he entertained, 3. I also wrote most fully in demi-official form, at different times, with the object of getting him to see things more clearly, and in their correct light. The chief points urged in all these communications were, that our communications with Beloochistan were to be solely with, and through, the Khan. That we were in n«v way to interfere with the Government of his country, but only offer our aid to the extent of giving him good advice through the Political Agent, with the view of promoting a settled, and strong Government in the country lying next to our Frontier. 4. All has however been without effect, t and he now not only persistently adheres to those views, though so repeatedly told they were wrong, and not to be followed, but he has most unreasonably, and, I consider, unjustifiably attacked His Highness the Khan of Khelat, and passed most undeserved censure on Captain Harrison, the Political Agent at that Court, for a variety of alleged misdeeds, not one of which appear to have been committed by that Officer. 5. Captain Sandeman, Assistant Commissioner Dhera Ghazee Khan, without Colonel Phayre's direct permission, but .apparently under the impression that it would meet withthat Officer's approval, most improperly opened communications -with the rebel Sirdars of Khelat, who were in exile in Affghanistan, telling them that, if they would detail all their grievances to him, he would see them righted. 6. This very unbecoming interference by an Officer totally unknown to the Khan, and who had no official connection whatever with Khelat, was naturally most distaste ful to His Highness, and he has very justly appealed against it. Captain Sandeman's conduct is the more extraordinary, as I had in January last, distinctly disapproved his communicating with the rebel Sirdar, Moolla Mahomed Raisanee, when the Murree Chiefs tried to bring such about. He has therefore not merely unduly meddled, and shown therein great discourtesy to His Highness the Khan, but he has exhibited marked disrespect to me, in so deliberately acting contrary to the instructions I had issued to the Officer in charge of the Sind Frontier, and which I had also expressed a desire that he would follow. 6. Captain Saudeman is an Officer of the Punjaub Government, but being in charge of the District next to the Sind Frontier, I have, since I became personally acquainted with him, last November, been in the habit of freely communicating to him my views and wishes, with regard to the management of affairs on the Frontier, so that there might be no mistake. Colonel Phayre very properly observes that Captain Sandeman's proceedings with regard to the Sirdars could not be justified; but the latter does attempt it, and without the slightest expression of regret at having been led away to act contrary to what I had desired. 7. The whole circumstances of what has passed lately, are so fully shown in the accompanying papers, that further remark is unnecessary here. I have only to record my opinion, and 1 do so with extreme reluctance, that the interests 'of Government in connection with the countries beyond our border, as well as the maintenance of satis factory relations with the Khelat State, must suffer, if longer entrusted in Colonel Phayre's hands, with the opinions he holds, and with the feelings he entertains towards His Highness the Khan. I would therefore beg to recommend for the consideration of Your Excellency in CoiKicil, that the Political Agent at Khelat be placed directly under the Commissioner in Sind, but sending copies of reports to the Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind, for information; that in all matters relating to the general policy with Khelat, the Political Superintendent and Commandant on the Frontier should refer to the Commissioner, and on no account enter into any arrangements with Chiefs, or sub jects of the Khelat State, without receiving first the approval and sanction of the Com missioner. I regret very much to have to recommend, that Colonel Phayre's powers should be so curtailed, but he has left me no alternative. I have the honor to bo, Right Honorable Sir, Your most obedient servant, AY. L. MEREWETEER, Colonel, Commissioner in Sind.F rom, To, Tlic Political A^ent, Ivhelat. The Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind. No. 20 of iSTO Khelat, 2Wi June ISTOi Sill, Tn forwarding the accompanying report, I have the honor to explain that I thought it advisable to defer writing for a month or so, as I should then be in a better position to report upon the political aspect of the country. + I object to this entirelT. The final dispute that cost the Jam iris country was raised by Oaptain Harrison him self, by interfering in regard to the Kuimnul Khan estate. R. P hayre. In my letter ^o. 51. of 1809, it was explained that His Highness had dispersed the Chiefs, whose main objectf had been to dethrone him, and that he had taken the administration of the province of Beyla into his own hands, entrusting the executive duties to his Shagassee, Wullee Mahomed. The latter showed by his acts that he was worthy of the trust that had been reposed in him. All recoverable property having been restored to the owners, and a con ciliatory policy established, he handed overcharge to his nephew, Goolam Jan, returning to his more important duties at Khelat. 3. On the 21st April I left Jacobabad for KheTat, but owing to the great heat, made no stay in the plains of Cutchee. I was glad however to hear from several Zemindars that, though they had been involved in debt for some years, the ample harvest of 18G9 had not only enabled them to clear themselves, but had lefl a small balance for the current year s expenses ; the supply of grain and flour for my detachment being limited, I pushed on without a halt to Sohrub. One circumstance I particularly noted when passing through the Moolah, cal culated to show the peaceful feeling in the country, as compared to the distrust that existed in 18G9. Last year the Brahooees and other wild tribes had tied with their flocks to distant hills an:l valleys, this year their litcle camps were fctudded all over the pass, and large flocks of sheep and goats grazing all about the country. 4. At Sohrab I halted a few days, partly to rest the baggage animals, but principally to give me an opportunity of mixing with the people of thisvalley, most of whom are Minguls. Witli this object T went ont coursing and shooting, and so far gained their confidence by taking part in their favourite pastimes, that they freely allndcd to what occurred last year, and appeared anxious to convince me that they had taken no part with the rebel Chiefs. 5. On the litli ultimo, we reached Khelat, and were received a few miles from camp by His Highness' nephews, the Zugger Mingul Sirdar, and a guard of honor. After the usual complimentary visits had been paid, I contented mvself with making personal observations, and was favorably impressed both as regards the place and its inhabitants. Hegarding the former, houses, walls of fields, gardens, &amp;c. have been repaired, thereby showing confidence in the present arrangements; and with reference to the latter, the demeanour of the people is far more friendly to us than it was last year, they not only bring flowers, fruit, &amp;c. to our tents, as tokens of good will and regard, but pa}^ us marked attention whenever they meet us. 0. On the 17th ultimo His Highness paid his usual weekly visit, and talked f to me regarding Kedj, Beyla, the t rhc mam pamt is what was. mid Purrees, and the cause of dispute between the on both sides about Ivedj, Bey la, ana 7 _ r the Munees. Affghan and Persian Governments. Kedj, from p the propinquity of the Persians, and the in- trl^iiino- character of Ibraim Khan, causes His Highness more anxiety than O O ' o •/ the rest of his possessions. He is aware that the Persian Government do not approve of Ibrahim Khan's conduct, and that it is their interference that has compelled him to abstain from any overt act. His Highness is also aware that, though not able to interfere openly, he, Ibrahim Khan, indirectly instigates others to commit acts, annoying to the Govern- t The particulars should have been , ... , ' ,, . ,, , , ,,.: ven ment of Belooclnstan.t Sirdar Eaqmr JViabomed v - has threatened to resign the Naibship of Kedj, but before doing so, has promised to come to Khelat and talk the matter over with His Highness. 7. Sundry telegrams have from time to time appeared in the papers regarding Beyla, the editors of which acknowledge the information as derived from the ' Sindian.'' Were the statements made t Are they all false ? ^ by this journalist reliable, there might be causef for uneasiness, to show however that they are not trustworthy, I will allude to two of the telegrams, 1st.—Sirdar Noordeen was reported to be This IS no proof at all. ^ ^ on the eve of attacking Beyla, when he was at Kharun en route to Hazargooft. 2nd.—A dispute attributed to His Highness* detachment was nothing more than a disagreement between Misree Mull, Kcterred to Khelat. ^ Revenue Collector, and Naib Meer Mun- iA. 1 . doo, details of which were given in my letter No. 19.8. I should not have alluded to the above, had you not thought it ad visable that reports of this kind should be contradicted. Before leaving the subject, it may not be out of place to quote His Highness' own words i.o the best of my knowledge, nothing has occurred to warrant the ' statements made by the press that these misrepresentations have evident- 44 ly been made by adherents of the late Jam of Beyla. ' I feel there are difficulties to contend with, sucli as must fall to the lot of a scneieign undertaking the rule of a new province, but am convinced that in the course of a few months, the people of Beyla will have every reason to c&lt; be satisfied and contented.' 0. A letter just leceived from Shagassee, Goolam Jan, states that the high prico ot grain, and a bad harvest in prospective, may jn'ess heavily on the peo ple, otherwise that they are quiet and contented. He also reports that he has sent for Misree Mull and Meer Mundoo, with the view of adjusting the dispute, particulars of which were given in my letter No. 19. 10. His Highness allusion to the Murree* tribe, and cause of dispute + Referring to Captain Sando- between the Affghan and Persian Governments, man and the visit to Kahun.^ ^ were noted in my Diary of 17tli May 1870, and need no recapitulation. On the 6th instant His Highness received a letter from some of the Murree tribe, but could not find out by whom it had been delivered, it was so fnJIS S HrH e ^ eling0 l thetribe far certified that Mehroola and Shere Maho- lowards His J-hghness, when even the Chief Gimen does not address med's seals were affixed; the substance of the IvtfJtWs whS communication was as follows—viz ; that they ventured to attribute to Captain were well disposed towards His Highness, ac- ^ P knowledged him as their ruler, and hoped that when opportunity offered, he would employ them in his service ; that they were aware of the acts of the tribe had not been such as to meet with his approval, that they themselves were his well-wishers, but could not control the behaviour of the ill-disposed who dwelt in the hills. 11. The relative positions between His Highness and Sirdars are the same as stated in December last. Sirdar Meah Khan, the late Jam of Beyla, is, as you know, located at Hydrabad, Sind ; Moolah Mahomed, the Haisanee Chief, has been in Caubool and Kandahar since the end of last year. Latest accounts of him state that the Ameer had given him 3,000 Rupees, and had promised to ask the English Government to interfere on his behalf. His Highness appeared anxious to know whether I thought it likely that the Ameer s request would be complied with, and what course of action he might anticipate. I replied that I did not think my Government would take up Entirely premature and unantho- t i • rised. this matter, that if they did, it would be then ^ ^ time to reconsider the subject. 12. Sirdar Noordeen was, as previously stated, en route to Kandahar aboutthe latter eiul of April, nothing has since been heard of him. Tlis wife and family arc still at AVud. The proposition made by the chief men of the Min- !Xul tribe, viz. that one of their number should remain at Khelat with a few fol lowers, relieving each other from time to time, was at once complied with by His Highness, and Sirdar Meah Mahomed arrived soon after the taking of Beyla, the other chief men of the tribe have been at Khelat for a few days, having business to transact with His Highness. lo. Sirdars Ala Deenah and \\ udeerah Adum Khan, when I last allu- Tf n + them, were at See bee, and declined tore- it was represented last year, that f . x +1 • . . they were so contented, that they 11 to their country, unless His Highness fur- l,a,i gone to thoi,- homes but they nished them with a written order, sayin'- that, have no confidence m the Khan's i t i r . 5 lIltlu promises. he iiatl forgix en them, and that they were at li- bcit^ to return ; though, this order was given, they preferred remaining at Seebce. Yar Ma homed, son of Ala Deenah, was at Khelat a few days ago, and had an interview with His Highness ; the object of this visit was to ascertain what His Highness' intentions were regarding his father and Wuderah Adum Khan. His High ness informed Yar Mahomed that he had written last year, to the effect that they ucic at liberty to li\e in any part of his country, and that no one should disturb them ; that they had been allowed to draw revenue from their lands in Cutchee, and that as his original letter stilt held good, provided they choose to return, further correspondence was not necessary. With the few exceptions -above detailed, the Sirdars of Beloochistan are living quietly and contented in their respective provinces, coming to see His Highness occasionally either for pleasure or on business. 11. iiequent references having been made regarding thieves and mur- derers from English territory, who have evaded justice by concealing themselves in the Choota country, His Highness thinks it ad visable that a trustworthy Agent of I lis should be located in that neighbourhood, to whom direct refer ence might be made, as the delay caused by the present system must facilitate the escape of criminals. 1 he name of His Highness Agent, where located, and the instructions lie has received, will be communicated at an early date. 15.

On Tuesday, the 14th instant, I called upon Ilis Highness and met Siulai booltan Ali Barukzai, son of Koondul Khan, who had made a pilgrim age to Mecca, and was en route to Caubool. His Highness received him with e\ery consideration and, on his departure, presented him with four camels, kinkobs, loongees, &amp;c.. This Sirdar appeared to be a very harmless inoffen sive man, and not likely to take an active part in the politics of his country. Six other Affghans of position and influence arrived at Khelat, soliciting em ployment ; as they had been retainers of Sirdar Abdool Rehman Khan, His Highness wisely declined their services, one of their number being ivurrum Khan Barukzai, nephew of the above Sirdar's Sha^assee.

(True Copies,) R. PHAYRE, Colonel, Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind.Remarks on Captain Harrisons report No. 29, of 2Uh June, and on the marginal notes hj Colonel Phayre. The marginal note to para : 2 is most unjust to Captain Harrison, and not warranted by the circumstances as they are stated in the public records. Captain Harrison, in July 1869, gave his good offices in the Kumal Khan village question, at the express desire of His Highness the Khan, but before acting in the manner asked for by the Khan, and the then Jam of Beyla, lie re ferred the matter through Colonel Phayre to me, and was told in reply, that I w ould not sanction the arrangement proposed. The Jam afterwards seized the grain revenues of the village, collected together a large body of armed men, and sent Circulars to the Chiefs of Beloochistan, calling on them to rise in rebellion against the Khan. 3?or the above insult, and for his generally dis obedient conduct, he was in September punished by the Khan. This dispute about the village was only used as a pretext by the Jam for his offensive pro- ceedings.^ lhat he had determined on renewed rebellion long before, is shown in a letter from him to Sirdar Chakur Khan, written some time in September, in the latter part of which occur the following words :—' I am in hopes you, u and the rest of the Brahooes will act up to the plans made in April last/' that is, when certain of the Sirdars were assembled near Khelat in hostile at titude against the Khan. 2. The first five paragraphs of Captain Harrison's report, I consider, show a very satisfactory state of affairs, and a great improvement in the condition of the country, as compared with former years. These results may justly be attributed to the firmness and judgment displayed by the Khan in the spring of 18G9, when his authority was threatened by the refractory Sirdars, to the vigour and promptitude shown by him when the Jam again rebelled iu Sep (.ember, and to the able manner in which his faithful Wuzzeer, the Shahgassee 'W ullee Mahomed, carried on the operations against the Jam, Tvhich ended in the latter s defeat and flight into Sind. The statement of Xaib Fukkeer Mahomed s intended resignation is of no real importance. I believe myself he has no intention of carrying it into effect. He has a very difficult position at Kedj, keeping order amongst a large number of petty Chiefs, and harassed by threatenings of attack from the Persian side, lately developed in the form of petty plundering within the Khan's dominions. He has repeatedly asked for assistance from His Highness, which the latter was not unfortunately in a position then to render. A force was despatched to Kedj in September last, but had to be directed to join the Shahgassee in his opera tions against the Jam. The desire to resign, most probably arose from the feeling, that he was not being suitably supported. He has now gone to Khelat to report matters to the Khan, and it may be reasonably hoped that, as the latter s hands are not so tied as they were, the Naib will be sent back to his Government, with means better adapted to the wants thereof. It is also to be hoped that His Highness may at an early date visit that part of his dominionshimself, see what is required, and make such arrangenicnts as are desirable for the due maintenance of his authority, and the good Government of the coun try. Naib Fukkeer Mahomed is a most faithful servant, and his worth is well appreciated by his master. lie has throughout steadily refused to join the other Sirdars in their rebellious acts against the Khan. 3. The statements in the Local Journals have, generally speaking, been untrue, or greatly exaggerated, as pointed out by me in recent correspond ence, particularly in the report from Captain Harrison, No. 19 of 18th May 1870, and Major Ross' No. 1 A, of 31st idem, forwarded under my Memo randum No. 354, of 22nd June. 4. Major Ross states—'From my own observation, I have no hesitation ' in stating that Captain Harrison is quite correct in surmising, that the state- ' ments in the newspapers regarding the state of affairs in Beyla are gross ' exaggerations. I was at Sonmeeanee in January, soon after the occupation tc of that district by the Khan's troops, and although some instances of looting ' occurred at that town, they were undoubtedly perpetrated by tribes resi- ' dent in Beyla, and not by the Khan's men. The Officers of the Khan re- ' pressed the disorders, and I could not perceive that the traders had any ' serious cause for complaint.' This is written by an Officer residing at the opposite side of Beloochiaton, and much nearer to the scene of the supposed disturbances than Captain Harrison. The first instance quoted by Captain Harrison proves one statement to have been utterly untrue. And as regards the second, Captain Harrison's rendering of it is borne out by what was report ed at the time. 5. The statements in the papers are prepared by certain interested parties at Kurrachee, some of whom used to benefit by being the Jam's Agents there, or in Beyla, and from scraps of intelligence forwarded by ill-informed people from a distance,—native writers I should say from the style. It is hardly neces sary for me to add that they are quite untrustworthy. G. Extract from Captain Harrison's Diary of the 21st May, alluded to in para : 10, is appended to the report by Colonel Phayre, to show what really occurred on the occasion. This weekly Diary by the Political Agent- was instituted by Colonel Phayre in April last, when Captain Harrison returned to Khelat, and is a good arrangement as an useful record of events. In re marks on a letter from Colonel Phayre to Captain Harrison, now also submit ted, I commented on the awkward position Captain Harrison was placed in by no intimation of Captain Sandeman's visit to the Murree hills having been con veyed to the Khan, hence the difficulty he experienced in discussing the matter with His Highness^ it is unnecessary for me therefore to say more on this subject here. But in reference to Colonel Phayre's marginal note about the Murrees, I would obseve that that tribe is broken up into factions, and though Ghuzzeen Khan is the nominal head of the whole, as direct descendant of former Chiefs,yet the different brandies do not in all things obey him. Hence there Is nothing strange in one portion addressing the Khan direct. The letter sent proves tliat section at all events subscribe allegiance to the Khan as ruler. It has long and often been stated, that theMurrees are most disobedient In their be haviour towards the Khan, and that hitherto he has unfortunately been unable to exercise effectual control over them, but the tribe generally have never failed in acknowledging themselves bis subjects. 7. As I read it, Ills Highness docs not complain that Captain Sandeman was the cause of the raid on Phoolajee, but that Captain Sandeman should be carrying on friendly relations with, and receiving certain, Murree Chiefs, while a part of the clan was committing raids on the plains of Cutchee, a portion of ol His Highness' dominions. The way to put an end to these, by sound measures, is to give our best aid in improving the administrative power of the Khan, so that he may be In a position to punish those who first break the peace. The Dhoombkee headmen brought the hostilities of the Murrees on themselves, and their appealing as they did to the Political Superintendent on the Frontier of Sind, was a piece of great impertinence, and so they should have been told. 8. It would perhaps have been more cautious had Captain Harrison, in stead of replying to the Khan, as mentioned in the latter part of para : 11, which Colonel Phayre styles ' entirely premature and unauthorised,' merely stated that he was not informed of Government having determined on any such course, and that when It was so intimated, it would then be time to enter on the subject. Captain Harrisons reply however, as it stands, pledges nothing. 9. In Colonel Phayre s note to para. 12, he has omitted to add that Captain Harrison further reported at the time that Sirdar Ala Dinnah and Wuddee- rah Adum Khan had, instead of accepting the liberal decision of the Khan, gone on to Seebee. 10. The arrangement described by Captain Harrison In para. 14, Is a very good one, and shows His Highness' ever-existing anxiety to meet the wishes of the British authorities. The Chootahs, whose country lies to the west of Hy- drabad, have always given much trouble to the Police of Lower Sind, by their depredations in, and quarrels with the people within, that part of our border. 11. The plan now introduced by the Khan will greatly facilitate the suppression of acts of violence by this tribe. 12. In reference to the marginal note to para. 15, It Is perfectly clear that Sohrab Khan, the Chief of the portion of the Dhoombkee tribe, residing at Lchree, has only himself to blame for being disturbed by theMurrees. Hepermitted a raiil to be made by some of his people Into the Ma tree coimtry, upon which that ttibe retaliated. Unless these interchanges- of hostilities are stopped, there will always be attacks and cOunter-attacks. Sohrab Khan had been repeatedly warned against such behaviour, both by Colonel Phayre and latterly by myself, when I was last at Jacobabad. 13. Captain Harrison's letter No. 56 of 18G9, and CoL Phayre s No. 18-38, were forwarded to Government with my letter No. 159, of 2Gth March 1870. li. As the paras, of Colonel Phayre's letter No, 1838 were notnurab-ered in the copy on record herCj it is not certain to which part he alludes in the latter part of his marginal note ; but it would seem to be the following ;—• ' I fear from all 1 have seen and heard, that the Khan is absorbed with ' an undue desire of again enjoying the extra subsidy of lis. 50,000, which ' was discontinued, owing to his having failed to secure the objects for which ' it was granted. I believe now that jealousy as the likelihood of our even- ' tually granting a portion of this sum to the Murrees, prompted Ins extra- ' ordinary action, as reported by Captain Harrison- I have arrived at this ' conclusion, by observing the incessant allusions made by His Highness' ' Vnkeel to this grant, and the inordinate desire to secure it; but the more conversant I become with Khelat affairs, the more convinced I am, that ' we can never again trust the uncontrolled disbursement of that sum to the ' Khelat Government, as done in the ease of the ordinary annual subsidy.' I did not especially allude to this para, in my forwarding letter No. 159, of 26th March, because it was disposed of in my general remarks, but as it has now been prominently noticed, I must remark that the whole is merely an assumption of Colonel Phayre's, prompted by the mistaken views he has un fortunately adopted of Khelat affairs generally. 15, Whatever the Vukecl's words or manner may have led him to believe, there is nothing on record to show that His Highness was actuated by the petty motives attributed to him by Colonel Phayre. The latter is well aware that His Highness lias always been, and is most ready and, willing to act in conformity with the wishes of the British Government, he would not therefore be likely to urge a point which would be objectionable, or work in such a man ner as to counteract the proceedings of the British authorities. 1G. The reply given by His Highness to the influential Affghans, who solicited employment under him, was most judicious. 17. I quite concur in the opinion expressed in the last para, of Captain Harrison's report, and 1 regret exceedingly to observe the marginal note affixed by Colonel Phayre. IS. I am decidedly of opinion that there is ample reason for judging the pre sent state of affairs in Beloochistan as more satisfactory than has been brought to the notice of Government for many years past, and that Captain Harrisondeserves the greatest credit instead of doubting criticism—for the good judg ment he has shown in using the influence which his straight -forward and wl considered management of the delicate duties entrusted to him, has gained for linn with His Highness the Ivhan. He has also, I hold, well and systemati cally carried out the policy directed to be followed in Mr. Secretary Seton Karr's letter No. 951, of the 13th July 1869. It is therefore with extreme regret I have to note the very depreciatory tone adopted by Colonel Phayre towards Captain Harrison, in the remarks he has made on that Officers acts and reports, m place of the generous support the latter had a right to expect in the very difficult and important position in which he was placed. 19. In conclusion, I would confidently commend Captain Harrison's good services to your Excellency's favorable consideration. Kurrachee, ) W. L, ME RE WETHER, Colonel, nth A ^ ust 1S70 - i Commissioner in Sind.events like that under notice should have stated the particulars of this event, and have given a sketch of the previous history of these Janotes, their probable numbers as to fighting strength, their general influence in the province, and their disposition at this moment towards the new rule in Lus Bey la. The omission of this tribe, as well as of any other important military element, from an historical sketch of a country and period, is a failure to show the pulse of that country, and in the case of Lus Beyla, particularly un fortunate, at a juncture when the Government require full and reliable information re garding it. Such a report would disprove the newspaper reports, which you merely stigmatise as 'unreliable and untrustworthy, 6. Again, you omit to record the views and action of the Khelat Government in the unfortunate dispute which recently occurred between Major Ross and Sirdar Fuqueer Ma- med, the Naib of Kedj, ending in the Sirdar's threatened resignation. This event formed a part of the history under report, and a most important one r as I believe he is now the only man of rank who holds office under the Khelat Government. No one can impeach his. character for loyalty and integrity, and yet some how or other he appears to be on the verge of ceasing to belong to^the administration of the Khanate. 7. In your 10th para., you allude to His Highness the Khan's conversation with you regarding Captain Sandeman's visit to the Murree head-quarters at Kahun in March last, and in connection with the correspondence as per fro^m^PoHHcaf^'^Hn^ndeii^to Capt! margin which has taken place regarding it, I mention, Harrison, and reply No. 23, dated 7th the following facts, in order that you may explain why June 18/0. y 0U omitted to satisfy His Highness' alleged curiosity regarding it. 8. In your reply to my letter No. 809, you offered the following explanation ' Regarding the visit to Kahun, not being able to satisfy His Highness curiosity, I ' turned the conversation to other subjects' 9. In reply to this, I beg to state that on my return to Jacobabad from Kurra- chee, in March last, you expressly asked me what right Captain Sandeman had to visit Kahun. I replied that he had gone with certain of the Punjab border Chiefs to Luggarree Barkhan accross the border, on matters connected with Punjab bonier affairs; and that on the way back, to visit me in my own districts at Kusmore, he, and all the Chiefs with him, including the MurreeS) took Kahun en route, in order to see the country and its communications. That I fully approved of what Captain Sandeman had done, and belived that good would result from it, by accustoming these wild tribes to the presence of English Officers amongst them, unattended by any military escort, and also by the valuable geographical knowledge that the Punjab Officers could obtain by it. 10. After this had occurred, you were present at Jacobabad in the following month (April), when both the Commissioner in Sind, Sir William Merewether, and Captain Sandeman were here also, and if you were not satisfied with the explanation which I had given to you, as detailed above, you had ample opportunity of speaking to Sir William Merewether on the subject, or to Captain Sandeman himself, and of thus obtaining any further information regarding the visit to Kahun that you required. 11. No sooner, however, do you reach Khelat, than you re-open the subject in } our l)iary of the 17th May, in what I cannot but consider a questionable manner aftei all that had occurred, and I shall therefore forward copies of what you have written to Captain Sandeman, in order that he may speak for himself.12. Independently, however, of any explanation he may be pleased to give, I have the honor to remind you, that both His Highness the Khan and yourself were kept fully informed by me of the orders of the Government of India, regarding the objects of the exploring expedition to the Murree tribes and beyond, which would have taken place last December, had it not been interrupted by an unforeseen event. Indeed, I have in my possession. His Highness' own reply to my full explanation of the subject, in which he expresses his appreciation of the intention of Government, and appointed his Vakeel to accompany me. 13. I must confess, therefore, that in the face of all these facts, I cannot under stand why you should not have afforded His Highness the information he sought re garding Captain Sandeman's flying visit to Kahun in question, instead of having had recourse to the unsatisfactory alternative of 'turning the conversation to other subjects,' thereby leading a native Prince to conclude that there was more in the visit of a British Officer to a remote part of his nominal territory, than there really was ; and raising a question as to the very propriety, as it were, of Captain Sandeman's conduct on that occasion,—conduct which, you well know, had my approval as Political Superintendent on the Frontier. 14. This reminds me of what took place last year, in the matter of the arrange ments for Eastern Cutchee from Murree raids, regarding which I made a full report to the Commissioner in Sind; and as it is absolutely ISSMated aXSecember ^ necessar y' in the interests of the British Government, that no more ' negative results' shall be incurred in our relations with the Murrees and Boogtees, either as regards the Punjab, Sind, or Cutchee, I shall have the honor to bring forward this matter at any conference that may be ordered to take place during the approaching cold season. 15. When important national interests are at stake, it is the safest and wisest plan for all concerned in the transactions affecting them, to speak very clearly, and therefore I must express how greatly I deprecate the spirit of partizanship with the Khan, manifested in your proceedings under review in the present report No. 29 of 1870. 16. The Government Resolution as per margin inculcated care on this point; and considering the fatal results, with which that case was GeyernracntGflndm letter No. 1194, shortly after attended to the Jam of Lus Beyla, I hoped of 26tlti August 1869, with Bombay Go- J J ' r vernment Kesolution N o. 3030, of 21st that you would have been less open to the party in- Stptember 18t3J. fluenceofthe Khan and his advisers. I regret to say however that your unreasonable defence of the Khan last year, when I discovered how he had tacitly thwarted my arrangements with the Murrees with a view to their miscarriage, greatly shook my confidence in you as a co-supporter of the policy which had received the sanction of Government, and now again your conduct in the same direction with regard to Captain Sandeman and his valuable efforts, which have received the commendation and sanction of the highest authorities in India and at home, obliges me with great reluctance, to request that you will desist from this spirit of partizanship. 17. Before I applied for you to be appointed Political Agent at Khelat, I conducted all political matters myself, in direct communication with the Khan, who expressed his rea diness to support the wishes of Government as represented by myself and the Punjab Officers; but I am now compelled, in the interests of Government, to state that my reliance on your support, in matters affecting the Murrees and Boogtees, is much shaken, becauseI can see tliat the Khan has enlisted your interest in a vain endeavour to carry ont his own impossible aims regarding those tribes, viz : that we should only treat with, and pay them through him, as was attempted so long back as 1862, and signally failed—vide correspondence in May 1802, between the Commissioner in Sind, Mr. Mansfield, and Sir H. Green. 18 Such a plan of procedure is just as practicable, and reasonable, as it would bo for any one to insist tbat tbe Punjab border Officers from Pesbawnr to Rajanpore should not treat with the hill tribes adjacent to their respective districts, excepting through the Ameer of Caubool, Shere Ali Khan. 19. In your 11th para, under reply, you allude to the sympathy which Sirdar Moolah Mahomed Raisanee, and others of Beloochistan have received at the hands of the Ameer of Caubool, on the occasion of their recent visit to that Capital to represent their grievances; and you report having informed His Highness the Khan, with reference J? ^ thereto, that you did not think the British Government would take up the matter. Considering that the British Government has nut yet declared its final intentions upon this very important question, it remains to be seen whether your reply to His Highness the Khan was premature or not. For my own part, viewing the question by the light ot our Indian policy generally, and knowing that a rule ot implacable repression is not only a very costly one at all times, but more especially so in time of war, I venture to hope that the British Government will not make Beloochistan an exception to the general rule of their benign, and kindly influence ; and that the cause of the unfortunate noble may receive that consideration at the hands of the British Government, which the liberal and strong ruler of Atfghanistan has announced his intention of advocating. 20. I note with satisfaction that the arrangements referred to in your 14th para., for the extradition of murderers and thieves, have been made. 21. With regard to your 16th para, nothing secure will be established for the protec tion of Eastern Cutchee until the permanent arrangements with the Murrees, and Boogtccs have been carried out. Within a day or two after that para, was penned, a serious raid was made by the Murrees into Cutchee, at Poolajee, in which 16 persons were said to have been murdered, and a number of cattle driven off. I have, &amp;e., (Signed) K. PHA\RE, Colonel, Political Superintendent, U. S. F. (True Copy) R. PIIAYRE, Colonel, ^ Political Superintendent, TJ. S. F. Remarks hy the Commissioner in Sind. 1 On Colonel Phayre's letter to the Political Agent Khelat, No. 1110 dated 21st July, herewith forwarded, and which he has submitted without the latter Officer's reply thereto* I would make the following remarks. 2. In the 3rd and 4th paras.. Colonel Phayre takes exception to the manner in which Captain Harrison had described the results following the assumption of direct rule by His Highness the Khan over the province of Beyla. I can see nothing in what Captain Harri son writes, that could lead to the supposition that what he stated was intended toP I nl I COrreCtneSS 0f Which he couM P ersotlaIl y vouch, excepting that, a. 1 olitical Officer at the Court of the Khan of Khelat, these matters had been communicated to him, he reported them accordingly, and having no reason to suppose them to he false ho did not recognise any necessity for expressing doubts regarding them. ''f 110 ! ''''™ sehoWslaves ' have been for years the most trusted and most faithful servants of the Khans of Khelat; and Goolam Jan, who has been appointed ruler of the piownco of Beyla, is son of the Shahgassee, Noor Mahomed, who fell bv the side of his master, Mchrab Khan, when Khelat was stormed by the British in 1839. The Khanazadas, literally, offspring or born of the house, are descendants of house- bold slaves, and being well looked after, and educated, it has always been the custom in Leloochistan to employ them in places of trust and importance. Shahgassce is a title of honor, resembling our Chamberlain, and was given to these people on assuming office about the Khan. , r '- In P ara - 5 Colonel Phayre comments on what he terms Captain Harrison's defence Of the Khclat troops at LusBcyla, and while allowing it to be quite possible it may be, as Captain Harmon reports from the place, where be is likely to get most information on the subject, Colonel Phayrc adduces what is only generally believed elsewhere. Captain Har- nson was quite right in the version he gave. The temporary disturbance caused by the disagreement between Misree Mull and Naib Meer Mundoo was reported to Government at the time, J he Janote question, refetxed to by Colonel Phayre, was a pitiful attempt by the Chief of the Janotes to revive the cause of the Ex-Jam, but directly the Shahgassee moved to the spot, the men, some 3 or 400 hundred, who had assembled, dispersed quietly, xhcro was no serious dispute between the troops, and the Janote tribe whatever. C. Captain Harrison will doubtless explain why he omitted to record proceedings in regard to Sirdar Fuqueer Mahomed, the able Naib of Kedj, and it i* to be regretted lhat his reply was not awaited before Colonel Phayre s letter, now under review, was submitted. Major Ross forwarded a letter from Naib Fuqueer Mahomed to him, regarding Kedj sub jects taking refuge in Gwadur. Its tone was I considered objectionable, and not of the usual respectful description used by that Sirdar. I therefore forwarded it through Colonel Phayre to His Highness the Khan of Khelat, when the latter returned an original letter to the Sirdar (which was passed on to him through Major Ross), directing him in future to refer in such matters to His Highness, when he would correspond with the British authorities. /. I see no reason to suppose that Fuqueer Mahomed really intends resigning his N aib- S ap ' He has now *one to Khelat to report matters to His Highness, and receive his orders. He has persistently throughout refused to join the Ex-Jam of Beyla, Azad Khan, and Sirdar Moolah Mahomed, in their rebellious procepdings against the Khan. S. ith legard to paras. 7 to 13, Captain Sandeman's proceedings will form the suh- * '^ a SL P aiate communication. I will only here passingly remark on certain of Colonel I tia\res observations, which I consider require notice. f&gt;. As Colonel Phayre does not appear to have informed His Highness the'Khan of (. aptain Sandeman's intention to visit, or of his having visited the Murree countries, or to- in..tiucUd C aptain Hauison to do so, the latter felt difficulty iu discussing the ques tion, so turned the subject. 'Hie exploring expedition, alluded to by Colonel Phayre in l~th paia. ct his lettci, had nothing to do with Captain Sandeman's visit, and thelatter, when it was proposed, ought to have been communioateJ to the Khan in the same manner as the former was. I regret that, in the press of other business, I omitted to cleai up this point when I was at Jacobabad in April last, and that I did not before moie particularly impress on Colonel Phayre the necessity of invariably intimating to the Khan, whenever any British Officer was about to travel through any portion ot hi^ country. It did not however occur to me that such was required. 10. In para 14 the expression ' negative results' is again used by Colonel Phayre, in re ference to our relations with Khelat and the Murrees and Boogtees, either as regards the Punjaub, Sind, or Cutchee, and he states that he will have the honor of bringing forward this matter at any conference that may be ordered to take place during the approach ing cold season. If by this it is intended to show, and from Avhat follows afterwards, it would appear so—vide para 18—that he. Colonel Phayre, contemplates action towards the Murrees and Boogtees should be carried out, otherwise than in the name of, and with the consent of, His Highness the Khan, I must record my entire dissent to any such views, as being directly contrary to the policy always followed with the Khelat Go vernment, as well as involving an interferance, as unwise as it would be unjust in the administrative power of the Khan, such as is in no way contemplated by Government, The state of affairs on the Punjaub Frontier, in reference to the Patau hill tribes, in no respect resembles that between the lower Punjab and Sind Frontier, with the Belooch tribes, Murree and Boogtee ; neither is the comparison of our relations with the Ameer of Caubool, and those with the Khan of Khelat an apt one. ith the latter we have an existing Treaty, in which he binds himself to prevent outrages on British territory by his subjects in the hills. 11. These he has done his best to put a stop to, but unfortuitous circumstances have prevented his succeeding. Still, though he has not been able to reduce those tribes to complete order, they acknowledge themselves to be his subjects, call him their Khan, and Wali or ruler, and the necessity for acting towards them through him, or by his consent, is not one wit less cogent now, than when the Treaty was made. 12. It is for this reason that it has always been advocated by all the Officers who have held command on the Frontier, before Colonel Phayre, that all arrangements considered by the Officers on the Punjaub side desirable to be entered into with the hill tribes, subjects of the Khan, should be carried out only in communication with the Political Superintendent of the Sind Frentier, that he might promote their inst itution thence with His Highness the Khan, either direct, or through the Political Agent, or through His Highness Vnkeel, who generally resides at Jacobabad. This was specially provided, in order that no act of ours should in any way tend to lessen the authority of the Khan, or rendei the difficulties he has to encounter, with regard to these distant and refractory people, greater than they unfortunately have been. 13. The ' partizanship' alluded to in the 15th para, as displayed by (aptain Harrison in his report No. 29 of 1870, is not quite clear to me, and I cannot certainly agree in the propriety of Colonel Phayre's deprecation thereof, conceiving it not to exist in the form Colonel Phayre's remarks would place it. That report is a simple straight -forward record of the present state of affairs, and most justly, in my opinion, points out a very manifest improvement for the better in the alfairs of Beloochistan. Captain Harrison has, I considei, fully carried out in its spirit the policy approved of by the Government of India, in leltoi No. 1028, dated 21th July 1869, forwarded under Government Besolution No. ot the 27th August, and again, iu Government of India letter No. 1194, of the 2r)th August 1809,Mr. Secretary Gonnes letter No. 2170, of the 3rd August, and Government Resolution No 3039. of the 21st September following. The only instance that may be in the slightest degree' quoted, as interference, was in the case of the lands of Kumal Khan, in Bhagwana, mention ed in another paper. He then interposed bis good offices at the request of the Khan, and in reporting the matter, wrote as follows ' Considering how weH His Highness behaved in the late dispute, I feel that the 'When the rebellioug Sirdars were 'aid he has asked in the present difficultv is not more assembled near Kholat. W. L. M. « + W f i , , ari friendly power might accord ; having however a ■■ doubt on the subject, I have thought it better to refer the matter.' This was written on the 30th July 1869, before Captain Harrison had received the instructions of the Government of India, dated 26th August. The course recommended by Captain Harrison was disapproved by me in a letter to Colonel Phayrc, dated 17th August, in the following words :— . - I have the honor to request you will inform Captain Harrison, that his referring 1 ' 0 matter 0 _ f 1 ' s aiJ having been asked by His Highness the Khan, in the question , ' 1 t ' 1 ' S t0 Kumal Khan ' s Vllla g e ' lvas correct.

Since the fZ all direct f ( ,: 0VCniniC1 ; t | inst ™ cti ° ns . Captain Harrison has steadily abstained July tl not • T' , q,leSti0n 0f Kumal Kha ' ,S Villi « e - which '■ Ju y was not, it was afterwards proved, the cause of the Jam's rising in arms against the Khan in September.

The further remarks commencing « I re gret are, I consider, in no way justified by what occurred. la. The circumstances here alluded to are given in the correspondence forwarded to Captain Harrison's letter Ka 56, of m ' TTT 'I' ^ ^ ^ 159 ' of th * 2Cth 2/th December 1809. March last, and relate to an assumption by Colonel loltCr N0 - I638 ' ° f Plla y re ' «'&gt;» the Khan had thwarted the arrangements , . ^ a&lt; ' ma dc with the Murrees, because he, the Khan, modliled hls pievioiisly made for the protection of his lands in Cutchee. ColonelPhayro's! amngomcnt with the Murrces was, tint thoy Wore to rocolve a monthly sum of lis. 6(K), on condition that they abstained from attempts at plundering in Cutchee, and if there was any -value in that arrangement, it relieved the Khan of the necessity of maintaining troops for the same purpose, thus enabling him to employ them elsewhere. 1(). The Murrees were unable to act up to the stipulations, as (so it was supposed, and T believe correctly) the Chief Guzzeen Khan, who entered into the agreement, had not power to restrain other sections of the tribes, over whom his control was but nominal. It was with reference to this Colonel Phayre ventured to maintain the Khan had tacitly thwarted him, and repeats the charge now. I see nothing in Captain Harrison's letter No. 56, of 27th December 18G1), forwarded under Colonel Phayre's No. 1838, of the 3()th idem, which can be justly termed ' unreasonable defence of the Khan,' and I am at a loss to discover how Colonel Phayre could have so considered it. 17. As regards Captain Harrison's conduct, in reference to Captain Sandeman's pro ceedings, that is treated of in other communications, and need not be further commented on here. 18. In my letter *No. 159, of the 26th March last, I expressed my concern in having • Copy of this letter and its aocom. t0 observe from the correspondence generally, that pauiments are appended for easy re- perfect confidence in the Political Agent, Captain ference ; they belong properly, and ir . . , -i. u u u i ^ i i should have been forwarded in connec- Harrison, was not reposed, as it should be, by Colonel tiou,with the papers submitted in Janu- Phayre, or as Captain Harrison's able and judicious ary last. W. L. M. t . , , , , _ r . . J , conduct, since he had been at Ivhelat, merited, and without which it was impossible that proper relations with the Foreign Court could be satisfactorily or advantageously maintained. I regret greatly to observe that in this para. 16, Colonel Phayre not only states that his confidence in Captain Harrison is greatly shaken, but adds accusation of not acting with him in the policy, which had received the sanction of Government. In this latter respect, I hold Colonel Phayre to be most grievously mistaken. He has been misled by the impression that the views he unfortunately adopted, and enunciated in April 1869, and i-epeated in the lengthy paper submitted by him on the 6th December last, are the correct ones, and in accord ance with the policy laid down by Government. He would have the Political Agent at Khelat act as arbiter between the Khan, and his nobles, and insist on the so-called rights demanded by the nobles being awarded to them, whether the Khan approved or not, because, as he would make it out, the Treaty between the British Government and Khelat was with the Khan, and nobles, not with the head of the Government of the country. The incorrectness of these views was fully ex- No. 269 of Ist May 1809. i • i i a n i i tm • 1^+™. w„.. Mo. 287 of 7th May 186{&gt;. plained by me to Colonel Phayre in my letters mai- Ko. 415 of 22nd ,hme 18(59. jnnallv noted. The policy therein laid down was No-435 of 26th June 1869. ^ „ , t ™ n j + u n fully approved by your Excellency, ana the Govern ment of India. Again, in forwarding Colonel Phayre's outline of Khelat aftairs, sub mitted by him on the 6th December, I pointed out fully the erroneous nature of the course lie would follow, and furnished him with a copy thereof, that he might act in accordance with the opinions I had expressed, at all events until any other line of con duct was laid down by higher authority. 19. He would also seem now desirous of maintaining that the Political Agent at Khelat should not give expression to the wishes, record with satisfaction the proceedings, or com ment favorably on the actions, of the Khan; that by doing so, he commits bimselt to undue partizanship. I am of opinion that this is a most false position to place one Political Offi cer in, and one that I decidedly disapprove of, as most dangerous to him, and destructive rof the value of his position. Judging from all Colonel Phayre has written, and now writes on the subject, under the views he holds, I can understand that he does not consider Captain Harrison as a co-worker in his policy, but I maintain that Captain Harrison has well acted up to the spirit of the instructions laid down for his guidance, and that he i* justl}' entitled to approbation, and support from Colonel Phayre, instead of censure and withdrawal of confidence. 20, Paras, 17 and 18 are again prompted by the wrong views entertained by Colonel Phayre, Ever since our connection with the Khelat State, it has been the object of the I blitical Superintendent on the Frontier to carefully avoid anything that may tend to lower the power, and influence of the Khan. For this reason, in all dealings with the Murrees and Boogtees, it has always been an object to make it known to them, that what we did, was with the consent of, and in conjunction with, the Khan, This should be continued, and there is not the least necessity, because a portion of the arrangements with these tribes have reference to the Punjaub, that the old system should be abandoned. It is in reference to this particular question, that I have so repeatedly urged, that all transactions with the lull tribes should invariably, and solely bo conducted through the Political Superintendent, frontier Uppei Sind, because he is the Officer in whose charge the political relations of Khelat are placed, and who should see that the Khan's proper position is not ignored. Captain Harrison having had experience under the abovementioned system, and being im- pressed with its justice, naturally brings to notice any points, wherein it appears to him, the old course is being deviated from. It is certainly not fair then that Captain Harrison s proceedings should be written of, as in the ITth para, of Colonel Phayre's letter. r Ihe Khan also has always shown himself most anxious to readily comply with any wishes expressed by the British Government, and as Colonel Phayre is well aware (from copies forwarded to him) of the proposals submitted by me to Government, that in the event of any grant being sanctioned by the Government of India for the better settlement of the Murrees and Bhoogtees, the amount was to be disbursed at Jacobabad in the name of His Highness the Khan, and paid through his Officers; as well as that on such on ar rangement being hereafter notified to His Highness, he would at once agree the rebuke, contained in the above quoted para., should not have been administered. 21. I have already pointed out that there is no analogy between the state of affairs on the Sind and Punjaub Frontier as regards Belooch, and Patau hill tribes. I would only draw attention here to the dangerous tendency shown by C )lonel Phayre in the 18th para, to act differently to the policy ordered and hitherto followed, and to express my opinion that such a deviation from what is clearly our just line of conduct towards the ruler of Khelat, will most injuriously affect the object we desire to bring about, viz. promoting a strong Government in that immediately neighbouring State. 22. The subject of the 19th para, is discussed in remarks on other correspondence, and I have only to add that, I notice with great regret. Colonel Phayre's persistance in consider ing the rebellious and self-exiled Sirdars of Beloochistan, as 'unfortunate nobles' and the victims of implacable repression.' 23. After all that has been written on the subject, and what occurred at Khelat in May 1869, I am at a loss to understand how he continues to hold these opinions, and apply such terms, as above, to the proceedings of His Highness the Khan of Khelat in respect especially to Sirdar Moollah Mahomed Raisanee. It only proves how necessary it is that there should be an early exposition of the views of Government in regard to the policy to be continued towards the Khelat Government, and this I would beg to ask for. .

The letter contains comments alongside the paragraph's by Colonel Phayre and Merewether's opinions that many of the comments made by the Colonel are unjust and unfair to Captain Harrison and that his report shows a satisfactory state of affairs and great improvement of the condition of the country as compared to prior years. Merewether's comments also cite correspondence from other frontier officials which support statements made by Captain Harrison and his full support of the concluding paragraph of Captain Harrison's letter and his regret at observing Colonel Phayre's note affixed to the paragraph as well as his opinion that Captain Harrison deserves great credit for his work in Khelat.Letter No.1110 of 1870 from Colonel Robert Phayre, Political Superintendent, Frontier Upper Sind, Jacobabad to Captain Charles Henry Harrison, Political Agent, Khelat, 21 July 1870 requesting further information on several points in the Captain's report (No.29 of 1870) before it is submitted to Government, discussing Captain Robert Sandeman's visit to Kahun and the way in which this had been reported to the Khan, and accusing Captain Harrison of having been enlisted by the Khan to carry out his own aims with regards to certain tribes. The letter also contains comments by Colonel Merewether in regards to its contents including his own opinion that Captain Harrison had appropriately reported news that had been given to him, which Colonel Phayre had objected to; that Captain Harrison was best placed to report on the Khelat troops at Lus Beyla [Bela] and that Colonel Phayre was basing his opinion on what was 'generally believed' instead of accepting the Captain's account; supporting Captain Harrison's decision to turn his conversation with the Khan away from the question of Captain Sandeman's visit as not only as Colonel Phayre not informed the Khan of it, he ad also not given the Captain permission to discuss it, and also stating that the exploring expedition had nothing to do with Captain Sandeman's visit despite Colonel Phayre's claims otherwise. Merewether also raises his concerns over the wording used by Colonel Phayre in regards to relations with Khelat and the Murrees and Boogtees and records his dissent against any possible plans the Colonel may have to contemplate action against those tribes without the Khan's consent. Merewether also contests the 'partizanship' which Colonel Phayre accuses Captain Harrison of, and states his opinion that the Captain has fully endorsed the spirit of the treaty with Khelat. The letter concludes by noting that much of Colonel Phayre's comments and opinions are still based on the incorrect views expressed by Colonel Phayre in 1869, which despite having been corrected on in several correspondence, he still appeared to pursue.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000009#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
