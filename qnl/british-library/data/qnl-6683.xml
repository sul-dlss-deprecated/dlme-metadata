[March 1.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. Book - Co p'V 2381 / 7 / 34 ] No. 1. Memorandum. American Advisers eor Persia. THE Persian Government having expressed the desire to place their financial administration in the hands of an American financial adviser, it seems desirable that His Majesty’s Government should explain why it is that they are prepared to give to this proposal their sincere support. Their attitude is, indeed, the logical outcome of the close and at times commanding interest which they have taken in Persia for considerably more than a century, and which has arisen from conditions (a) historical, (6) economic and financial, and (c) political. A few words may be said about each of these. (a.) The historical connection of Great Britain with Persia dates from the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when an English mission assisted Shah Abbas (1598) to reorganise the Persian army. It was, however, in the early days of the 19th century that the geographical proximity of Persia to the expanding sphere of influence of the Eayt India Company, and the acute rivalry at that time existing between Great Britain and Prance in the East, led to the institution of close diplomatic relations between the two countries. Ihe connection has lasted ever since, and for the past 120 years Persia has been regarded by successive British Ministries, as well as by the Government of India, as a British interest of the highest importance. A peaceful, stable, friendly and independent Persia has been throughout this period one of tjie chief aims of British policy. During the second half of the 19th century Persia became, for reasons which are well known, a stage on which the long-standing rivalry between Great Britain and Bussia in Asia was fought out with diplomatic weapons. The tension was continuous and sometimes menacing ; at length, in 1907, an attempt to terminate it in a manner honourable to both parties, and, as it was hoped, favourable to Persia herself, was made by the Anglo-Russian Agreement of that year. Unfortunately this insirument aroused the deep suspicions of the Persian Government and people, who saw in it only a scheme for the partition of their country between Russia and Great Britain, suspicions which were, to a large extent, justified by the police and actions of Russia, who proceeded to act as though she were a dictator in the northern parts of Persia _ within her sphere. This agreement perished during the war and there is no question of its revival. The history of Persia during the Great War need not be recapitulated here. It is enough to say that she was only saved successively from German, Turkish and Russian inroads by the aid of British troops and at the cost of the British and Indian Exchequers. When hostilities ceased, leaving Persia in a state of complete financial and administrative collapse, a serious endeavour was made by His Majesty’s Government to set her upon her legs again, and tie Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1919 was concluded. No attempt was made in that agreement to impair or to compromise the independence of Persia. On the contrary, it was categorically and expressly reaffirmed and guaranteed. What His Majesty’s Government sought to do was to provide Persia with the means by which that independence could best be secured. They offered to assist her in creating an independent national military force of her own, lending her expert assistance in the organisation of a purely Persian army. They sought to purify her internal administration and to give her a scheme of sound finance. They aimed at opening up communications and developing the resources of the country. At the same time, as a sequel to the agreement, a loan of 2,000,000L was offered to Persia, guaranteed upon the customs and other revenues of the country, and she obtained simultaneously a tariff revision which proved very greatly to her advantage. Soonafter the agreement was signed and after a portion of the loan had actually been paid over, the Persian Government that concluded it fell from power and since then it has been difficult for [7961 a —1] B2 anyone, even from the inside, to follow the kaleidoscopic changes that have taken place at Tehran. Prime Minister succeeded Prime Minister with almost bewildering rapidity, and there were during this period almost as many Persian policies as there were Prime Ministers. One week the policy would be that of abandoning the Anglo-Persian Agreement, but still keeping in touch with the British, and getting as much out of them as could be obtained. Another^ week the policy would be that of breaking with the British, and inducing Swedes, Frenchmen or Americans to interest themselves in various aspects of the administration. A third week saw a cringing and terrified subjection to Soviet threats. The life of each Persian Ministry coincided with its power to bribe its supporters or to keep its opponents in subjection, sometimes even in prison. As a result of these vicissitudes, of a widespread propaganda directed to prove that Persia was bartering her independence, and of the increasing power and influence of the Soviet forces in the north, the Anglo-Persian Agreement was finally repudiated by the Persian Government, and was without much reluctance abandoned by the British Government, who were reluctant to offer an assistance that was not welcome, or to accept responsibilities that were daily becoming graver and more irksome. The Persian Government has since been engaged in the none too easy task of discovering some new and magnanimous friend who would extricate the country from its financial embarrassments, and give it the moral support of a not too openly interested assistance. (6.) Economically, Persia is in a deplorable condition. Her imports greatly exceed her exports, and her expenditure enormously exceeds her revenue. So long as the resources of the country remain undeveloped, the former disadvantage cannot be remedied; but it should be possible, with honest and intelligent supervision, provided there is the requisite force behind it, to bring about serious reforms in the financial administration. This, however, is a task which can only be achieved by the introduc tion of foreign advisers with very full powers, loyally supported (as has never hitherto been the case) by a reasonably stable and competent native administration. Many efforts in this direction have been made from time to time with varying success. The Customs were placed under Belgian officials in 1900, and have been effectively administered by them ever since. The result has been a great increase of revenue which, for the first time in Persian history, found its way direct to the Persian Treasury. On the other hand, all attempts to place the Ministry of Finance under the guidance of a foreign adviser or administrator have met with uniform disaster. The first of these was made in 1903, when M. Naus, the Belgian Director of Customs, was placed in charge, but was forced to retire almost immediately. The second attempt was that of M. Bizot, a French official, who was appointed Financial Adviser in 1907. His efforts to help the Persians to reform their finances proved entirely abortive, as they refused to confer on him any executive powers and his advice was systematically ignored. The third effort in this direction was that of Mr. Morgan Shuster, who was appointed Treasurer-General in 1911. In spite of the active support of a considerable body of Persian public opinion, and particularly that of the Persian Parliament, Mr. Shuster failed because his methods—radical and courageous as they were—brought him into sharp and inevitable conflict with the Russians*. The final effort was that of Mr. Armitage Smith, a capable official of His Majesty’s Treasury, who, in pursuance of the terms of the Anglo-Persian Agreement, was sent to Persia in 1920 to reorganise its finances. He found himself very much in the same position as Mr. Morgan Shuster had been some years previously. Against him were arrayed all ther forces of selfishness, corruption and intrigue. Mr. Armitage Smith returned to England a few months later in despair, and so did the various British officers who, in connection with the agreement, were engaged in assisting Persia to reorganise her administration. The confusion that exists in the financial department of the Persian Government afc Tehran is deplorable beyond measure. No serious effort to draw up a budget has ever been made, and the system in force—if such an expression can be applied to it— is one that lends itself to every conceivable form of peculation and corruption that oriental ingenuity can contrive. As far back as 1900 the Persian Government embarked upon a career of recourse to foreign loans. From that date until the conclusion of the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907, Persia successfully played off the Imperial Russian Government against His Majesty’s Government, with the result that she borrowed large sums of money alternately from Russia and Great Britain.3 The total debt to Russia in 1919 was approximately 6,000,000L ; but this the Soviet Government has agreed to cancel.* There remains Persia’s indebtedness to Great Britain for various loans and advances made from 1903 onwards, namely :— Loan of 1903 ... Floating advances £ 300,000 3,700,000 Public Loan, 1911 4,000,000 1,250,000 Total 5,250,000 to which must be added certain claims for arms, munitions, &amp;c., supplied by His Majesty’s Government, and the claims of British subjects for compensation for losses sustained in Persia through the negligence or culpability of the Persian Government. (c.) It has already been stated in an earlier part of this memorandum that an independent Persia is a'fundamental axiom of Great Britain’s policy in the East. The geographical position of the country is alone sufficient to demonstrate this proposition. On the east Persia is a close neighbour of the Indian Empire and it is only natural that with the many millions of Moslem subjects of the King Emperor in India, His Majesty’s Government should desire the friendliest relations with the greatest surviving Shiah State whose ancient literature and culture still exercise no inconsiderable influence in other Mahommedan countries. Strategically the position of Persia, midway between Afghanistan and Mesopotamia, in both of which countries Great Britain is intimately concerned, invests her with an importance out of all proportion to her intrinsic strength. On the south the Persian Gulf has for more than a century been the scene of active British influence and a predominant British trade. Piracy has been suppressed, the slave trade has been abolished, the waters have been lighted and buoyed, and order has been observed by the exertions of Great Britain who is in close treaty relations with all the chieftains and sheikhs on the Arab coast of the Gulf. On the north-eastern or Persian shore the Sheikh of Mohammerah who, though ostensibly a Persian subject, is virtually independent, is also in very intimate relations with the British Government. In that region the wells refineries and workshops of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Maidan-i-Naftun and Abadan are a national asset of the hrst magnitude. The British Resident and Consul-General at Bushire has for a century exerted a very potent influence both throughout the Gulf ports and in the Persian hinterland, where the connections between the British Government and the Bakhtiari khans, who are the owners of the land upon which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s wells are situated, as well as other tribal chieftains, are very close. Thu British interests in Southern Persia are of a very definite and special nature, which has been repeatedly and explicitly laid down by British Ministries of all parties and has been acknowledged by all the Governments and parties concerned. Further to the west Mesopotamia and Kurdistan march with the Persian border. The railway from Baghdad has already reached a point north of Khanikin on the Persian frontier at Quraitu, and the extension of this line within Persia is a matter that is now engaging the attention of a British railway syndicate, who have obtained an option from the Persian Government for the construction of this line from railhead to Tehran, and other options in the same vicinity. In Northern Persia, namely the provinces ol Gilan, Mazanderan, Khorasan, Azerbaijan and Asterabad, to which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession does not extend, a combined Anglo-American group is at present negotiating on the basis of a joint exploitation of the oil deposits which are known to exist in certain regions within those provinces. His Majesty’s Government are watching these negotiations with sympathetic interest, and earnestly hope that a satisfactory understanding will be reached by the two groups interested in the enterprise. Such is the general political situation. The danger against which both the British and the United States Governments will have to guard with the utmost vigilance is the * See article 8 of Kusso-Persian Treaty of February 26, 1921. [7961 a—1] B 24 tendency displayed by all Persian Governments—whatever their complexion—to play off one Power against the other in order to gain the utmost advantage for themselves by the familiar processes of oriental diplomacy. Persian statesmen have found by past experience. that they can safely exploit the rivalries of Western nations by these traditional methods. They have indeed practised them from time immemorial upon their own powerful tribes with unvarying success, and of recent years Great Britain ant! Russia were deliberately played off one against the other, until these two Powe^ 1 2 3 4 5 endeavoured, by means of an agreement between themselves, to put an end to the practice. The danger of allowing the Persians to carry on these methods with impunity is self-evident. Unscrupulous Persian statesmen succeed in maintaining themselves in office for a few months, during which they enrich themselves at the expense of the country, while Persia gradually sinks further and further into anarchy and decay, and no advantage accrues to her neighbours or to those who may seek to befriend her. The above account has not dealt with the enormous expenditure incurred by His Majesty’s Government on military undertakings in Persia, on the building of roads throughout the country, or on the upkeep for five years, from 1916 to 1921, entirely at the charge of His Majesty’s Government, of the South Persia Rifles in Pars and Kerman, which were armed and equipped in order to preserve some semblance of order and security in the southern and eastern provinces during the war. So far from these forces having been maintained in any spirit of hostility to the Persian Government, it was the latter that pleaded over and over again for their retention. The burden, however, was one which neither the British nor the Indian Government were willing any longer to bear, and in dhe course of 1921 the South Persia Rifles were finally disbanded and the whole of the British forces were withdrawn. The Persian army is at this moment under the command of a new general named Reza Khan, who is at the same time Minister of War, and his expenditure on the army is reported to reach the enormous sum of nearly 1,700,COOL a year, which exceeds the whole available yearly revenues of the State, leaving nothing for administrative expenditure excepting that which Persia can secure from foreign countries by means of loans. It is obvious that such a state of things cannot continue and that the military aspect of Persian finance is as much in need of a complete and drastic overhauling as is every other part of the administrative machine. The foregoing account, though it by' no means covers the whole ground, will have sufficed to give a general impression of the Persian situation as it appears to His Majesty’s Government at the present time. The principles which, it has been shown, must underlie the policy of the British Government in the future, as in the past, may be clearly deduced from what has preceded :— 1. The British Government, are mainly concerned in the maintenance of Persia’s independence and integrity, and are prepared to co-operate in any well- planned efforts to sustain and revive her national existence. 2. The development of Persian resources and the revival of Persian trade by any legitimate means are equally an object of interest to Great Britain. 3. His Majesty’s Government have paramount interests in Southern Persia and the Persian Gulf which impel them to take a special interest in those regions. 4. His Majesty’s Treasury cannot lose sight of the indebtedness of Persia to Great Britain, and must look to the regular payment of interest and sinking fund on these debts out of Persia’s available resources, some of which are already pledged to her. 5. His Majesty’s Government, having tried unsuccessfully to assist Persia to improve her internal administration and to introduce sound financial methods, are prepared to extend a loyal assistance to the United States Government if the latter decide, after full consideration, to undertake the task. The question by whom Persia is to be regenerated is of vastly less importance than that her regeneration should take place. A better chance of effecting this end can hardly be imagined than that a great and friendly and disinterested Power like the United States should be willing to enter the field. Some things the United States Government will do best by itself. In others it may profit by the co-operation and support of those who have been so long on the ground. From this point of view His Majesty’s Government will give to any American officials who may be chosen by the5 United States Government their fullest diplomatic support at Tehran in the hope that by the united action of the British and United States Governments and by the frankest exchange of views between them a real improvement in Persia’s internal administration may result. 6. As regards foreign commercial enterprise in Persia, His Majesty’s Government adhere without qualification to the principle of the “ open door.” His Majesty’s Government have placed on record the above considerations, and now submit them to the United States Government in the assured conviction that Persia affords a field where the two great English-speaking nations may, by working together, bring about results that will enure both to the advantage of the Persian people and to the peace and orosperity of the Eastern world.
