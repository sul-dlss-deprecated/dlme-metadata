G. McNie, of the Iraqi Ministry of Economics and Communications, on the History of Steam Navigation in the Middle East.—{Communicated.by His Majesty's Embassy at Bagdad, October 1934.) [In continuation of Foreign Office Memorandum No. 10207, Confidential, of April 24, 1913, respecting the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates.] IN spite of the remoteness and inaccessibility of Iraq from the birthplace of steam navigation, the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris saw the first steamers only seventeen years after the Comet, the first successful commercial steam vessel, had been launched on the Clyde. This early contact was due to the enterprise of the British Government in trying to find, by means of steam navigation, a shorter route to India than that round the Cape when they decided to place steamers on the Euphrates to run from Berijah near Aleppo to the Shatt-el-Arab. It could not have been by chance that the Euphrates was selected, as there was an English trading station at Aleppo in Queen Elizabeth's time, which owned over 300 vessels on that river, whether safinas or shakturs (see Note 1) is not known, and this trading station was used for the transmission of goods from the Far East as well as from Arabia. It is mentioned.by Shakespeare in one of his plays : 'My husband's to Aleppo gone, captain of the Tiger,' and there is actually a record of the journey of two London merchants to Tripoli aboard the Tyger, on their way to Aleppo, Bagdad and Ormuz. In 1835 an expedition was formed and named after its commander, Colonel Chesney, 'The Chesney Expedition.' This new venture started from England in February aboard the sailing ship George Canning, which carried as part of its cargo two paddle steamers in plates and framework, as well as the seventy-five members of the expedition, which consisted of naval ratings, marines and artillerymen. The George Canning landed the expedition at the mouth of the River Orontes in the Gulf of Sardia on the Syrian coast (Note 2), on the 12th March of the same year, and Colonel Chesney was faced with the difficult task of transporting two steamers, in sections, with all their machinery, from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, a distance of over 180 miles, with little or no roads, and very inadequate transport facilities. This, however, was accomplished safely, though many anxious days were experienced with the boilers and engines, which could not be dismantled into easily handled packages. As an instance, it is said that it took 104 oxen with fifty-two drivers to haul the boiler of the Tigris, which was the smaller of the two vessels. On reaching the Euphrates, a base was established miles below Benjek and called Port William (Note 3), after the then reigning monarch of Great Britain, and the work of assembling the two steamers was begun. The vessels were reassembled and launched, and called the Euphrates and the Tigris, and they started their first voyage on the 16th March, 1836, almost a year from the date of landing. Considering the difficulties of transport, of establishing a port, and the backwardness of the country in which they were working, this in itself was a remarkable feat. These two steamers were built by John Laird of Liverpool m 1834, the Euphrates being 103 feet long by 19 feet beam, and the Tigris 70 feet long by 16 feet beam, and had engines of 50 and 20 horse-power, respectively. The Tigris had a very short existence, as she was sunk during a violent squall on the 21st May, only two months after starting the downward trip. The squall was so great that the two vessels lost touch with each other for a time, and 7670 [10822]then almost collided, but the waves were so high and the visibility so poor that the Euphrates could render no assistance to the smaller vessel. The whole ot the cash carried by the expedition and a large part of the instruments and stores were lost with the Tigris, and the position of the wreck could not be immediately located. i u a ^ This unfortunate disaster occurred at Werdi, about 90 miles above an ^ twenty members of the crew were drowned, including Lieutenant Cockburn 01 the Royal Artillery, and Lieutenant Lynch of the 26th Bengal Native Infantiy, who was a brother of the second-in-command. Lieutenant Henry Blosse Lynch. The remnant of the expedition carried on in the Euphrates and made a survey of the River Euphrates to Kurna; they arrived at Basra on the 19th June, 1836, and then proceeded to Bushire to refit. On the 25th July, repairs having been completed, the Euphrates was towed from Bushire to the Shatt-el-Arab by the Elphinstone, and then proceeded under her own steam up that estuary to Kut-el-Frangi, the modern Margil (Note 4), which was then the home of the Basra Political Agency. Later, with Colonel Chesney and Lieutenant H. B. Lynch on board, she steamed up the Tigris to Bagdad (Note 5), arriving there on the 30th August, 1836, the first steamship to be seen in front of that historic city. She left again for Mohammerah on the 5th September. ttt - it Some time after this she sailed from Mohammerah, bound for Port William, carrying an Indian mail for Europe, but only got as far as Lam-Lam, 140 miles upstream, when a serious accident befell her machinery, and she had to drift back all the way to her starting place for repair. These repairs were carried out by the help of the Indian naval steamer, the Hugh Lindsay (Note 6), the first steamship to enter the Persian Gulf (Note 7). This accident, together with the disaster to the Tigris, helped to a great extent to discourage the home authorities, and it was acknowledged that the Isthmus and Red Sea route, though longer, would be cheaper and safer than the Euphrates route, and in consequence, in January 1837, the expedition was broken up and the surviving vessel, the Euphrates, was handed over to the Honourable East India Company. The expedition had failed, but it had served a purpose. It had introduced steamships and steam-driven machinery to a little-known country, and brought that country to the notice of people who were one day to see the possibilities of using these modern inventions on its rivers for the benefit of its people. An attempt was made by Lieutenant H. B. Lynch to reach Mosul in 1837, but the Euphrates only got as far as Nimrod at the junction of the Tigris and the Greater Zab (Note 8). The East India Company were still playing with the idea of utilising steam navigation on the Euphrates and Tigris, and sent out Commander Hawkins to take charge of the vessel and make another trip up river. In March 1838 the Euphrates steamed up the river as far as Hit, but great difficulty was experienced in passing the marshes on its lower courses, and an adverse report resulted. In 1838 Lieutenant Lynch again took the Euphrates up the same river from Kurna (Note 9) to above Eallujah, and, steaming down the Saklawiyah and Khirr Canals (Note 10), crossed the desert from the Euphrates to the Tigris, a memorable voyage, and one not to be equalled until 1912. After crossing the desert. Lieutenant Lynch made another attempt in his vessel to reach Mosul, but he had to return after reaching Kut Abdullah, about 20 miles from his goal. In June 1839, in order to furnish proper surveys of the Tigris and Euphrates, the East India Company sent out via the Cape three other iron steam vessels. These three vessels, named the A ssyria, the Nimrod and the Nitocris, were shipped in framework on the sailing vessel Urania, and they arrived in Basra on the 22nd December, 1839. Here they were immediately put together at Kut-el-Frangi, or Margil, and finished in April 1840, and from that date until 1842 the steam flotilla on the two rivers consisted of Euphrates, Nimrod, Assyria and Nitocris. The Euphrates had very little artillery, but the new steamers each carried six swivel guns and a large gun, mounted fore and aft. The activities of these four vessels were well known, and a complete navigable survey of the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates was accomplished. The chief performance of the flotilla was a trip up the Euphrates in the Nitocris and Nimrod in 1841 by Lieutenant C. D. Campbell, assisted by Lieutenant Felix Jones.They left Basra on the 1st April, and reached Meskena on the 31st May, and the little Nimrod, under Campbell, got as far as Beles^ which was considered a very remarkable feat. During the downward trip the Nimrod struck a snag or roc v and was sunk, but she was raised and refloated, and Kurna was reached abou the end of May 1842. The only result of this remarkable voyage, untortunateiy, was clearly to demonstrate that the navigation of the River Euphrates was ^ In 1837 Captain Estcourt of the Chesney Expedition had reached Ahwaz in the steamer Euphrates, and reported on its possibilities. Therefore, m 1841, the Assyria, under Lieutenant Selby, navigated the Karun (Note 11), ana a so its tributaries the Gorgar and the Diz, as far as Shuster and Kut Bandar, as well as the Bahmanshir channel, from Mohammerah to the sea. An account of several voyages performed by Mr. Layard the eminent archaeologist, in the Assyria, on both the Karun and the Tigris, is mentioned m his early adventures. . - p k All this was of great service to the countries concerned, in spite oi oostacies and obiections put in the way by Turks, Russians and Persians. The genera outcome of the Chesney Expedition and of over twenty years of labour on the part of the Indian naval officers, who continued its work, was that Iraq nad been converted from a terra incognita into a country perfectly well understood in its main features, and with certain important districts outlined m great detail. After the survey was completed and no further work could be lound tor tne four vessels, the Euphrates, the Nimrod and the Assyria were withdrawn m 1842, and taken in tow to Bombay by the East I nd ian C o mpa n y steamer Semiramis, the Euphrates on the 13th May, the Nimrod on the 29th June, and the ^5wm on the 10th August. , , i? t The Nitocris remained on the two rivers under the command of Lieutenant Felix Jones, who succeeded Captain H B. Lynch m 1843, and m lS^ he made an attempt in her reach Mosul, but only got as far as Teknt, 142 miles above Bagdad. On the 16th May, 1846, the Nit was taken to Bombay for repairs and overhaul, and she returned to Bagdad in 1847, still under the command of Lieutenant Felix Jones. . 1 During the time she was away for repairs there was a rumour that she would not be returned or replaced, and the local merchants were seriously f rt ^ ed petitioned for her to be sent back or replaced, as they declared that the presence of a British gunboat on the Tigris was very necessary for safe navigation^ The Nitocris was particularly useful in 1849, when m consequence of tribal wars all locally owned navigation was stopped, though British-owned vessels were permitted to pass freely up and down the Tigris. In 1850, however she was reported unserviceable, and in 1852 was so crippled by defective boilers that even had the Itesident approved she could not have been prudently sent on any service where she might be required to come into action ^ ^ ^ w At length in 1852 after a delay caused by the Burmese war, the Comet, a by no means new but otherwise suitable vessel, was refitted and sent out to Iraq to take the place of the Nitocris, which was broken up m Bagdad m the same year The Comet was an old vessel of the Indian navy which had been built in 1838 and had taken part in the Sind operations in 1843. It does not appear that she was named after Henry Bell's famous steamer on the Clyde as the Indian navy possessed at this time a whole galaxy of astronomical bodies including a a SaUUiU ^l^tZeh, the Euphrates, the the the Nimrod, the Nitocris, and the Comet were the real pioneers of steam navigation in Iraq. The Huqh Lindsay, as far as can be ascertained, did not return after effecting repairs to the Euphrates in 1836 and neither did the Semiramis, after its visit in 1842 to tow the Euphrates, Nimrod and the Assyria to Bombay, until its return during the Persian campaign. i i-i • ■ 4.1. About this time the Turkish Government began to see possibilities in the use of steam vessels which could ply independently of wind or current Here was an instrument to their hands to collect taxes or to overawe the unruly, a force that could be sent off without any delay and without the high costs of moving troops and baggage In 1850-51, therefore, the Turkish Government , started the Oman Ottoman Shipping Company, and their first two steamers were the and Zmti .which were built in Belgium and sent out to Iraq m sections. Two more from the same firm, the Alans and the came out m 1854. [10822] B 24 o Basra, about 1854, was visited by some of the new British steam frigates, very much larger vessels than any of the others. They were stationed in the Shatt-el-Arab at different periods during the Crimea War in order to demonstrate against the Persians, who were inclined to favour the Russian cause, and so visits were paid by the Auckland, the Ajdaia and the Akbar, the Akbar pro ceeding up the estuary as far as Kurna. The Shatt was to have another influx of steamers in 1857 when the Persian war was drawing to a close and Sir J. Outram, the general in command, arrived before Mohammerah with the steam frigates Ferooz, Assaye, S emir amis, Ajdaia and Victoria of the Indian navy. They were assisted by the river gunboats, Assyria and Planet, and also by the Bagdad Political Agency vessel, Comet. This was the second visit to Iraq of the vessels Assyria and ^ emir amis, the Semiramis having come out in 1842 to tow the Assyria and her sister ships, Nimrod and Euphrates, to Bombay. The Comet especially distinguished herself in a dash to Ahwaz with the Assyria and Planet, under Commander Rennie. With the 78th Highlanders aboard they completed the rout of the Persians without loss to themselves and the campaign came to an end. About 1856 the Oman Ottoman Company began to have trouble with their steamers, as those who had control lacked the business qualities and experience necessary for running vessels. The boats were badly managed and did not run to time, and the Wali of that time, Kozlukly Mohd. Rashid Pasha, applied to the East India Company for the loan of an officer to put in charge of their vessels; Captain A. C. Holland, of the Comet, was appointed to the command of the Baghdadi and he was the captain of the first Turkish steamer in Iraq. Single- handed he could do very little, as his complaints went unheeded, and those in authority over him did their best to work against him instead of with him for the benefit of the company, so things went from bad to worse, and the merchants were again obliged to go back to their old way of working with mahelas. At this period a wealthy Bagdad merchant, Joseph Ezra Abraham Goorjy, made a great effort to establish some steamers on the Tigris under the charge of Captain Holland, but the Turkish authorities, unwilling to proclaim their own failure, would not grant him the necessary permit. In 1862 the firm of Lynch and Co., brothers of Lieutenant H. B. Lynch of the Chesney Expedition, through the good offices of Colonel R. Taylor, the Resident Agent at that time, got permission to run steamers on the Tigris, and com missioned the City of London, which had been built on the Thames r t _ a T&gt; ._ in - e an( j q 0 an( j gent out rounc [ the Cape in a sailing ship in In the following year, 1863, during the administration of Namyk Pasha, three more steam vessels were ordered from Belgium for the Oman Ottoman Company, named the Phrat, Mosul and the Resafah. They did not, however, arrive at Basra until 1869. In 1865 Lynch Brothers had placed another steamer on the run. This was the Dejla, built in London by the same firm that built the London, and these two vessels carried the mails to connect up with the British India Steam Navigation Company, which had opened a service to Basra in 1863 (Note 12). Lynch Brothers were now strongly established. In 1871 the Oman Company brought out two more vessels which were built .at Trieste. They were called the Telafar and the Maskena, and had engines of 50 b.h.p. The Maskena was a sort of freak ship. She had four paddle wheels and was sent out in plates and angles to Maskena on the Upper Euphrates. Here she was launched and for a time she plied between Maskena and Saklawiyah above Eallujah. In 1864 the Comet was reported unserviceable, and a relief ship called the Satellite was sent out from Bombay to relieve her, but whether she arrived or was lost en route is not known as no record can be found, but she does not seem to have plied as a Residency vessel on the Tigris and the Comet was not relieved until 1884. Prior to 1869 the Otaian Ottoman Company's vessels were used purely for Government purposes, such as the transport of troops, carrying of despatches and the subjection of tribes, but, subsequent to that year, they were devoted mainly to the carrying of cargo and passengers with the avowed intention of running % I r . v5 Lynch's steamers off the river. The running of the river steamers proved a great benefit to the merchants, who no longer had to wait until convoys of mahelas were formed for mutual protection, and the thirty to fifty days spent in tracking local boats up and down the river was reduced to some six or eight. The payment of tolls to the sheikhs on the river, wherever they touched or banked in for the night, was also abolished and theft of goods by robbers reduced to a minimum. The Lynch boats became exceedingly popular for many reasons other than speed and reliability. They towed and carried a great deal of cargo, which was neither broached on the way or lost in the godowns, and their passengers were not called upon to pay their fares twice nor were they otherwise imposed upon. They sailed regularly and to time and, as they ran in conjunction with the British India Company, Bagdad, enjoyed, for the first time, the great advantage of an outward and inward weekly mail service. Under the first firman the British Government were allowed to have twc\ vessels on the Euphrates and Tigris, but when Lynch's were granted permission for a steamer service, Constantinople apparently purposely confused the political vessel with those of Lynch Brothers, and persisted in stating from time to time that the concession was only for two vessels and not for three. Right up to the outbreak of the Great War, therefore, Lynch Brothers were liable, at any time, to have their vessels stopped and a guard put on them. The reasons given were varied and childish. Sometimes it was because the firman stated steamers only were allowed and not steamers and barges, although there is little difference between towing cargo and carrying it. Sometimes it was a definition of ' duba ' (barge). An iron barge was a ' duba,' and there was no mention of dubas in the articles and though they might tow mahelas they were not, on any account, allowed to tow dubas. This attitude on the part of the Turkish Government almost suggested that they wanted to restrict trade instead of increase it in the interior, and although Lynch applied to run vessels north of Bagdad to Samarrah it was not allowed. Whenever Lynch's vessels were laid up, however, the Oman Ottoman freights were increased and the people responsible for the embargo were amongst the most disgusted, as there was more cargo to hand than both companies could conveniently carry. The country was still in an unruly state, even round and close to the principal towns, and in 1872 the British India mail steamer Cashmere was boarded and looted at Basra by a gang of armed robbers, practically under the guns qf a Turkish war vessel. The thieves got away with property to the value of 42,000 rupees and killed a fireman and wounded the chief engineer, the chief officer and thirteen of the crew. Strong remonstrances made by the British Government resulted in most of the loot being recovered, and all the thieves with one or two exceptions were caught; several were hanged and the rest imprisoned. The incident of the Cashmere described above brought the Sheikh of Mohammerah to assist the authorities in the recovery of the loot and the apprehension of the culprits, and it was through his efforts that most of the booty was recaptured. In gratitude, the British India Company gave orders that thereafter all their ships should fire a salute in the sheikh's honour as they passed his palace at Mohammerah. This practice was continued until in recent years he was removed at the order of the Shah to Tehran. On one occasion this practice again nearly led to an international incident. Apparently, by accident or on purpose, someone had placed a cricket ball in the small mortar on a British India ship that was approaching Mohammerah. This was undetected, and when the round was fired the projectile fell startlingly near the sentry on guard at the sheikh's palace. It took quite a lot of explaining by both the company and the British Government before his Excellency was pacified. In 1874 His Majesty's steam frigate Philamel paid a visit to the port and went up the estuary as far as Kurna. In 1876 the Lynch steamer Dejla was sunk and totally lost through running on to the wreck of sunken mahela in Bagdadiyah Reach below Suwairah, where the wreck can still be seen in the low-water season. In 1878 1 Lynch and Co. put a new steamer into commission called the Blosse Lynch, named after the elder brother, and she was followed by the Kalifah in 1880 and by the Medjidiyah in 1881. Life on the Tigris in those days could be exciting. In 1874 a lion and twoor three lionesses had been shot from the deck of the Lynch steamer Dejla by Captain Clements, who reported that one of the lionesses had sprung into the water and attempted to board the vessel. On the 8th July, 1880, the new Lynch steamer Khalifmh was attacked by Arabs at Seayfor near Ezra's Tomb. The marauders tried to board her and failing this kept up an incessant rifle fire and killed a quartermaster and a passenger before the vessel got out of range. The captain, Mr. Clements, and chief engineer, Mr. Cole, were both badly wounded. The perpetrators of this outrage were never brought to justice, though several expeditions were sent against them by the Turkish Government. In 1879 the Oman vessel Tela far caught fire in the Shatt-el-Arab and was completely gutted. As it was considered too expensive to have her repaired and refitted she was never used again. The Oman Ottoman Company were not very fortunate in the running of their vessels, due to the want of proper supervision and properly trained officers and engineers, and to the practice of having their repairs done by local blacksmiths instead of in a properly organised workship; consequently many of their vessels fell into disrepair and were often out of action for many months. For instance, the Baghdadi lay at Amarah for two months in 1882, and the Mosul was laid up at Basra from August 1882 until June 1883, a period of ten months. The Resafah was under repair for a year, and after 1883 the ^Basrawi was no longer employed, all due to neglect and chicanery on the part of those responsible. In 1882 it was found absolutely necessary to replace the Residency vessel, the Comet, which had, since her exciting adventure up the Karun during the Persian war in 1857, led a useful, worthy, but uneventful existence as a carrier of despatches and mails, surveillance and protection of British trade and shipping, surveying and observation work and in maintaining friendly relations with the tribes on the rivers. After forty-four years of service she had to be laid away, but she had a respite, as the new vessel building at Bombay was not ready and Lynch's City of London was chartered to run on the rivers in the meantime as the Residency gunboat. It was a short-lived charter though, as when the City of London was proceeding to Bagdad she ran on a sand-bank at the mouth of the Sweib River near Kurna, broke her back and was totally lost. Later it was found that the new vessel constructed was too large for use on the Tigris and consequently a new vessel had to be built, but it was not ready until 1884. On its arrival the old Comet was broken up at South Gate (Note 13) in the same year. The new Comet was a vessel 125 feet long by 25 feet beam, drawing 3 feet of water and having a speed of 9 knots; her crew consisted of 1 officer, 4 warrant officers, 35 petty officers and men, and her armament was two •45-in. 5-barrel Nordenfelt guns. This Comet was not a lucky vessel, and her first commander. Captain Havelin, died in his bath at Ctesiphon on her first trip to Bagdad. The inconvenience of having no captain, however, did not deter Mr. Plowden, the British Resident at that time, from projecting a trip to Mosul, and in April 1885 (far too late in the year) a start was made. The gunner, a man named Nelson, was placed in command. Fahamah was reached the first day, and after a prolonged halt of fifteen days they arrived within 10 miles of the Adhaim. After two more days they made Tikrit and two days later they ran aground about 10 miles below Baiji. Many attempts were made to refloat her, but they proved fruitless. Mr. Plowden had therefore to return to Bagdad by Killick (Note 14) and the Comet remained hard and fast for almost a year until April 1886, when she was got off by her new commander. Captain Downs, and, on the top of a big rise, reached Bagdad in twenty-four hours. In 1894 the Comet, under Lieutenant Elwell Sutton made a trip up the river as far as Samarah, but she did little of note, except the customary duties, until the outbreak of the Great War. In 1890 Bagdad was to have it first shipbuilder; he was a local blacksmith- mechanic named Joseph Haluta, and in the years between 1890 and 1895 he built the hulls of five vessels, the Dejla, the Hamidi or Nasrat, the Musoodi, the Sarawadi and the Othmanli. With one exception, the engines for his boats were purchased abroad, but the plates and angles were bought in the local market. The Dejla and the Hamidi were the first two screw vessels to belong to the country with the exception of Lynch's steam launch and Mackenzie Gray's Arab, which came out in 1874 and 1884 respectively. The Masoodi and the Sarawadi7 were stern-wheelers, but the Othmanli was a paddle boat, her paddle shafts having originally been used on the old Comet. It was a remarkable feat, as Haluta was an illiterate man and could not make a drawing or plan, but laid out his plate and frames apparently by eye. It seems likely, though, that he must have had some assistance, as his stern-wheelers, as well as his screw vessels, were the first in the country and it is known that lie bought his vertical engine (probably out of Lynch's old launch) for the Hamidi from Abdullah, one of the engineers of the old Comet. These vessels ran for a time between Bagdad and Samarah on the pilgrim trade, and then the Dejla was sold to Abdul Jabbar -el-Khedhery, who ran it between Basra and Bagdad until it was laid up in 1929. The Hamidi eventually ran between Basra and Mohammerah as the Mudheiffery, but it sank near Salchiyah in 1923. The Masoodi also went to Basra, but sunk through neglect at Sarajah Creek. The Sarawadi, like the others, went to Basra, and is still running between there and Mohammerah as the Mudheiffery. The Othmanli, Haluta's largest vessel, had the shortest life, as she sunk at the Bagdad customs wharf in flood time after a trip to Samarah in 1906. In 1892 the firm of Lynch Brothers put a new steamer, the Malamir, on the river, and her first year was marked by a rebellion against the Turkish Govern ment of the Abu-Mohammed tribe. This tribe lived on the river and were responsible for the attack on the Khalifah in 1880 and for attacks on local and Turkish vessels in 1878, when on one occasion nine people were murdered. The tribe rose under Sheikh Zaidan, and several boats were plundered between Qalat Saleh and Kurna. The steamer Mosul was also fired on and prevented from passing through the disturbed area, though, on the same occasion, British vessels were allowed to proceed unmolested. About 1896 the Meskend, with a cargo of wool aboard, caught fire at Basra, and, being completely gutted, was left to corrode at Margil. In 1902 two Turkish gunboats arrived at Basra, the Kiled-el-Bahr and the Zohaf. In 1904 the old Oman Ottoman Company was purchased by the Senniye Department of the Ottoman Government, and they brought out in the same year the Barhaniyah and the Hamidiyah. These two steamers were built on the Clyde and sent out in plates and angles and reassembled at Basra under the supervision of Mr. Graham, their superintendent engineer. In 1908 the Turkish Government sent out to the Shatt-el-Arab the cruiser Marmaris, and in the following year Lynch Brothers put their large twin-screw steamer on the river. This was the J ulnar, which was later to distinguish itself in the war. In 1910 Asfar had a steamer called the Etoile de VOrient, and in 1912 the Senniye Department brought out their largest vessels, the Basrah and the Baghdad, which were fine double-engined, four-cylinder boats, 212 feet long and of 60 feet beam. Wonkhaus had started by now, and in 1912 they brought out the large screw tug the Pioneer and two steam launches, the Tekrit the Samarah. Two fast Thorneycroft river gunboats next made their appearance on the rivers for the Turkish Government, but, as far as can be found out, they had no names given them, but were called the ' offspring of the Marmaris ' They must, however, have had some distinguishing number or colour. In 1912 the municipality instituted a ferry service between Karradah and Bagdad, and had two small steamers on that run called the Birinji and Ikinji. It could not have been a great success, as in 1912 the Ikinji crossed to the Euphrates by way of the Khirr and Saklawiyah canals in order to work on the construction of the Hindiyah Barrage, and the hull was still there up till a few years ago. The Birinji was sunk below Nasiriyah in 1914. At the outbreak of the Turko-Italian war in 1911 the Zohaf was sent from Basra to assist the Turkish navy in the Mediterranean, but she was captured by the Italians in the Eed Sea. . ^ i Before the Great War broke out m 1914 it was known that the Turks favoured the Germans, and the British cruiser Esfiegle arrived in the Shatt-el-Arab to protect British interests, and on the 7th October a curious message in Turkish and Arabic was received aboard which read : ' £ Please you8 leave the Shatt before twenty-four hours '; of this no notice was taken, and another message was received on the 13th which gave them eight days, after which force of arms was threatened. The Espiegle, however, remained until all ships had cleared and until war was declared between Britain and Turkey on the 31st. On the outbreak of war all Lynch's steamers with the exception of the Khalifah escaped capture, and the Medjidiyah, convoyed by the Comet, conveyed some hundreds of British refugees to Mohammerah. The presence of the Comet at Mohammerah after the outbreak of war was strongly objected to by the Turks. They demanded that she should be forced to leave Persian waters, and with the idea of giving her a warm reception all down the Shatt-el-Arab as soon as she appeared, they lined the banks of the estuary with artillery. The surveys done by her predecessors had, however, borne fruit, and the Bahmanshir Channel (Note 15), which was parallel to the Shatt and connects Mohammerah to the sea, was sounded and found to be sufficient for her draught. Accordingly, one day, well screened by date-palms and quite ^ * unsuspected by the Turks, the Comet steamed down the back channel to join the British Expeditionary Force, and the chagrined Turks, who were still looking over their gun sights, were politely informed by the Persians that their demands had been complied with. The Comet from now on had a brief but glorious existence, and was in action continuously from Kurna to Amarah, and it was on her that General Townsend steamed ahead of his forces and bluffed the Turkish Commander of Amarah into a surrender, though he was 50 miles ahead of his troops and had only twenty-two Europeans aboard besides himself. She was also at the first battle of Kut, and Lieutenant-Commander Cookson, who was aboard her, was killed in a gallant enterprise for which his name was honoured by a posthumous V.C. The Comet, along with the Firefly, the Shaitan, the Shushan and the Sumana, took part in the advance to Ctesiphon, and in the retreat the Firefly ran aground at Aziziyah. The Comet, going to her assistance, came under heavy shell fire from both river banks and had to be abandoned aground and in flames though the crew of both vessels escaped in the boats and were rescued by the Sumana. It is a curious fact that Mr. Tom Dexter, late dragoman of the Residency, was an engineer on board of her when she first came out from Bombay and his son, Henry T. Dexter, was an engineer on her when she was shelled and destroyed. Of the Turkish war vessels, the Mar maris was sunk by the Esyieqle at Kurna; one of its ''children' was sunk at Basra, the other was captured at Nasiriyah and is now the Tilda of the Basra Port Authority. The Kiled-el-Bahr was sunk in the Shatt-el-Arab along with the old Baghdadi, the Alans, the Etoile de VOrient and a German ship called the Echatana, to provide an obstruction to the advance of the British war vessels. The Mosul was captured by Townsend in the first advance, and, after having run for some time between Basra and Sheikh Saad, was sunk at the mouth of the Chahala in order to divert the river as much as possible into the main channel. The Basrah was captured at Aziziyah, and after being run for some time was sent to Britain in 1919, but being in bad condition it did not eret further than Malta or Gibraltar. 8 Of the Wonkhaus tugs, the Pioneer, was captured at Aziziyah in General Maude's advance, where she was acting as a gunboat, and was used by the British until 1919, when she was released and is still running on the Tigris under the Iraq flag. The other two were sunk, the Samarah by gunfire near Nasiriyah, and the Tikrit by the Turks in order to avoid capture by the British when they caught up with her near .Shergat. The early Naus had corroded and rotted at Basra long before the war, and the Phrat and the Resafah were sunk to block.the Euphrates Channel at Asawi Bend below Nasiriyah to prevent the passage of the British expeditionary vessels. The Barhaniyah and the Hamidiyah were blown up by the Turks to avoid capture, the first at Baiji and the Hamidiyah at Fatah. The Khalifah was recaptured at Aziziyah and is still in running order, as is also the Malamir. The Blosse Lynch was only broken up in 1926 and the Medjidiyah in 1928. The J ulnar yt as the vessel which made the famous attempt to break the boom defending Kut in order to reach Townsend with food and ammunition, but theo 9 boom being made of chain and wire rope laid at an angle, the J ulnar ran herself into the bank where she was captured, with all her crew who remained alive. She was under the charge of Commander Firman and Lieutenant-Commander Cowley. Firman was killed and Cowley murdered by General Nured Din of the Turkish Army, but both received post-humously the V.C. for their gallantry. The Senniye steamer Baghdad, being one of the newest and most powerful vessels with the Turks, managed to reach Mosul where she was captured, and was the first steamer in history to reach there, though there had been repeated attempts made by British Residency vessels since 1837. These being of small power could not stem the current. Steamers in Persia. We have already seen that Ahwaz had been visited in 1837 by the steamer Euphrates under Captain Estcount, in 1841 by Lieutenant Selby in the Assyria and in 1857 by the Comet and the Planet. In 1882 the Persians decided to try steam navigation for themselves, although their rivers did not lend themselves to navigation as easily as the Euphrates and Tigris, and in 1882 the Sheikh of Mohammerah had a small steamer plying called the Karun. In 1885 after the Karun River had been opened for navigation by order of the Shah, the firms of Grey, Mackenzie and Lynch despatched the Arab and the Blosse Lynch respectively to ply to Ahwaz. Later the Blosse Lynch was replaced by a stern-wheeler called the Shushan, a vessel of 150 feet and drawing only 21 feet of water. In 1889 the Shah placed on the river the screw steamers Persepolis and Susa, which had been ordered from Germany in 1885. These last were found to be unsuitable and the PersepoUs was withdrawn and made a Gulf gunboat. In 1890, for diplomatic reasons, the Shushan was presented as a gift to the Shah and was run between Ahwaz and Basra, while the Susa maintained the connexion between Shuster and Ahwaz. Naval activities died a natural death in Persia, as far as the Gulf and the Karun were concerned, as, except for the running of the Imperial Customs vessel Mazaffri in 1902, no other vessels appear to have been brought out before the Great Wai;. Bushire also had its little share of steamboat history, as it had, in 1872, an old Indian navy vessel called the Berenice, supplied for the use of the British Resident Sir Felix Jones, who had been responsible for a lot of survey work in Iraq in the early days. After 1876 Bushire was without a vessel until 1887, when the Lawrence was sent out by the Royal Indian Marine. The Lawrence was a fairly large vessel of 900 gross tons, 1,277 h.p., a speed of 12 knots and a crew of 90 men. She did yeoman service in the Gulf in British interests, and was serviceable enough to join the British expedition to Kurna when war broke out in 1914.

It is told that in the early days when the pay of the crew of the Turkish gunboats (which was nearly always in arrears) was very long overdue, they would detach and sell some of the wooden paddle floats, with the result that when orders to sail arrived, they were unable to do so, and had to make a report of an imaginary breakdown to machinery in order to get money to replace the wooden paddle floats. An interesting relic was discovered in a home in Bagdad recently; it was the ship's bell of the second Comet, which was set on fire and sunk by shell fire at Aziziyah by the Turks during Townsend's retreat from Ctesiphon, and it is hoped that a suitable home may be found for it in some British museum in the near future.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that, as the result of the action mentioned in paragraph 5 of my despatch No. 309 of the 5th June last, M. Olivan telegraphed to the Prime Minister on the 7th June proposing that, in order to allay the tension which had made itself felt as the result of the indeterminate outcome of his visit, all the inmates of the Mosul camp for destitutes and 1,000 indigents from Mosul town should be transferred to Syria at once. For this purpose he asked the Iraqi Government to establish a credit of £60,000 at Beirut in the name of the League. The Prime Minister replied accepting these proposals. Copies of these two telegrams and of M. Olivan's valedictory message to the Prime Minister are enclosed herein. 2. In a final telegram to me M. Olivan informed me that he was leaving Beirut on the 8th June and that M. Arocha would follow him on the 15th June, after visiting the Gharb and Khabur to inspect the alternative areas in which it is proposed that the Assyrians should be resettled. M. Cuenod will arrive in Bagdad on the 12th June and will proceed at once to Mosul, where the local •committee has been reconstituted, under Major Thomson, in order to arrange the transportation of those who are to leave now for Syria.

Repeated Political Resident, Bushire No.5159. Dated i&gt;th received 6th November 193b. Begins As Honourable Members will be aware from reports which have appeared in Press certain leaders of Iraqi Army delivered an ultimatum to King of Iraq on morning of October 29th calling upon His Majesty to dismiss Government of General Yasin Pasha immediately and to appoint a new administration under Hikmat Sulaiman, a former Cabinet Minister. The ultimatum added that failing this. Army which was concentrated near-by for manoeuvres, would march upon Baghdad. hasten compliance with these demands, four small bombs were dropped in neighbourhood of Government Offices, Baghdad. In early afternoon Government resigned and, at request of King Ghazi Pasha, Hikmat Sulaiman at once formed an administration. Previous to change of Government an attempt was made to persuade military leaders not to enter Baghdad and Minister of Defence, General Ja»far Pasha, was sent to meet them with a letter from King Ghazi Pasha. This attempt failed and His Majesty»s Government have been shocked to learn that General Jatfar Pasha, who was formerly Iraqi Minister in London and was a valued friend to this country, was murdered in circumstances which are not yet clear. Shortly afterwards apparently in order toApart from this incident and a few casaulties which occurred from bombs dropped on Baghdad, there does not appear to have been any further outrage, and General Yasin Pasha and other prominent politicians have been able to leave country unharmed. The latest information available indicates country is quiet and there is nothing to show at present that safety of Iraqi Jews, Assyrians or any other Iraqi minorities is in jeopardy. The resignation of constitutionally appointed Government of Iraq as a result of violent action by Army leaders is a development which naturally causes His Majesty*s Government concern. It is difficult to forecast future political developments, but His Majesty's Ambassador, Baghdad has received from new Prime Minister assurance(s) of his (in &lt;? on) necessity for Iraq maintaining close and friendly relations with His Majesty's Government, and of his intention to govern in conformity with constitution. I may add on learning of events of October 29th instructions were sent to His Majesty's Ambassador to warn new Prime Minister of deplorable effect which would be caused by any further outrage such as murder of General Ja'far Pasha, and to emphasize that one of principal criterions by which new Government would be judged outside Iraq would be humanity of their treatment of minorities.

Thus it came about cnat tne Hasnimx oovermaent had itself made arrangements to concentrate the bulk of the Army in an area wxtnin easy striicxng distance of the Capital - a clear proof that the Cabinet had no fears as to the loyalty of its troops. 9. xho fignoxn^, value of one ^rmy cannot be descrxbed as of a high order, but could be claasifiea as adequate for tne purpose for wnxcn it was subsequently usea, corps ox' offices is not drawn from the be^t materxal available, and the rank and file'are mixea volunteers and conscripts enrollea x'rom the less intelligent glasses. providea therefore, that tile real object of the various manoeuvrings leadxng up to the events of octobex 29th was not aisclosed, 3ekr jid^i coula taKe tne gamble i'or a successful issue with some #ptimism. l0» The ^ra^i aix l^rce was a aix*fern^ proposition and in view of its value as a striking force, it was essential tnat it should be in to to on BeKr 3idgi ! s siae.

A© was natural for an officer of his distinction, he paid his respects to his Sovereign soon after his return; ana in view of the friendship existing between xnem, it is probable tnat the King confided in him, complained of the irksome control applied by the prime Minister and told him of tne opposition leaders pressing demands for a change in Cabinet. 14. Be txiat as it may, the germ of the idea was soon being aevelopeu; the army concentration at should prove an excellent opportunity but action mucit be tai^en before the Chief Qf tne General 3taff returned from leuve^ ana at ^he same time, the Ai^ i^orce must bu won over. Having worked out a feasible scneme ana naving as^red himself that the Minister of Defence had n^ sus picions, the next tiling was to find a poliiidian behind whom the new movement could be ranged. 15.

He said that it was unreasonable for tne troops to be pre paring for manoeuvres over a type of country unlike that in winch the operations were to taKe place, and ordered tne division to move oown to forthwith. ijuch a move would at least ensure txiat txiose troopcs of itnown loyalty to him were in a positxon to make a rapid advance on tne Capital. 27th Oct. 20. T he fo llowing day, the 2nd Division arrived at and it wao obvious that sudden changes in tne arrangements of the training preliminary to tne combined manoeuvres had taken place, 'i 'ne acting 0. Gr. £&gt;. had apparently con ceived an iaea of a surprise test fcr a mobile force of picKea troops from the 2nd Division. Vithout the knowledge of his brigadiers, but with the co-operation of tne battalion commanders, 4 battalions were made up from companies of various units of tne 2nd Division. i'his force together witn tne hotor M.G. Company, ana the 1st and 2nd Cavalry, were to carry out a secret scheme wnich was to start operation on tne 26th October; ana sha^ir al .vadi, U-.o^O.l. 2nd Division, was responsibly for txie re-organisation 0'£ tne units to take part. «81. On this morning also Mohainmed All Jo wad, Ooiiimander of the 'Iraqi Air j'oroe accompanied by AJ^ram Mushtaq., 0. G.

It was eviaent txiat the exercise was mtenuea to simulate war conditions as closely as possible; the Dragons were carrying spares and bombs, while all aircraft were armed with machine guns ana three were carrying a loaa of 20 lb, bombs* In addition, the 'Iraqi Air tree's limited transport was loadea up witn warlike stores ana aespatched by road towaras ^iUGiiAitf. 24. This unannounced move of the Air j^orce was naturally Imown shortly afterwaixis and con jecture was rife as to wnat was afoot. In some quarters, it was suggestea tnat tii-eso activities might be connectea with an attempt at a coup d'etat^ but in view of tue complete calm pre vailing amongst members of the Cabinet this surmise dia not obtain much support. suffice it to say- that tue government had no ixUcli^ t oT'''tne impendir^g tnreat dhd' certainly tooxc no steps to combat iti events of tne 29tn October. 25. The kinister of Defence, Ja'afar al As^ari, had an early appointment on this morning to meet tne Afghan Minister of War and nis cmef of jtaff at iMOxtTn Railway station; and apparently witnout a care to worry him he attenaed tnis ceremony and displayed nis usual bland good humour,7. 2b• In the meanwnile tne bitaaxion was rapial/ aeveloijing at i3 ; WU3A' wnere BeiEr was at the head of his stpi^nig force.

T nia letter signea by jeicr iSid^i and ,^bdul Latif Nmrji f announced tnaT^urOTess tne'liashimi Cabinet resigned within three hours, military action would TbV tanen against the capital.

The premier woulu have Ixked time to consider wnom he but he realised that was important, ana, after would invite to join him an immediate announcement ^ ^ ^ _ much telephoning and message sending, tne names of the new Uinisters were published on the morning of the 5uth October, They were; ~ prime Ministe r d I'linister of interior.

The death of Ja'afar al Askari was generally icnown on the night of the 2^th, and it was widely believed that the remaining leaders In the late Cabinet might share his fate.

The ex-Minister of interior, Ha^hia All al Qa-J-lani, was in a better position ana had little to fear as there existed close family ties between himself ana the new Premier. 41. iii^mat ..jol eiinan was genuinely upset at Ja'afar's murder ana there is no doubt that he tola j^eiir'lilayi that no further political murders were under any circumstances to taiee place, arrangements were made for Yassm ai Haahimi and Hashid Ali to be escorted to the Syrian frontier by the trans-desert route, wnile the Hoyal Air ^orce unaertooic to evacuate Hurl as sa* id and his family by air. 42. a fourtii person for whose safety fears were felt was Taha al Hashimx, the ex-O^U. o., who was due to arrive from by rail on the 30th. It appears, however, tiiat a message was got through to him aavising mm nat to cross tne frontier. Two Dragons of tne 'Ira^i 4 4ir ibrce were sent to MO^WL on tne olst October, but it is not known whetner their instructions were to turn Taha bacx or to bring him to the capital. in any ca^e, the aircraft returned empty on the 2nd November, ana it can be presumed that Taha al Hashimi is also unliarmea.12. 43. _ rhuB the new Government can aevote itself to the v/oin nandj unlioupex'ecL oy the presence of those wno woula be yXx^ected go use tneix 1 considerably influence towards aiscr&amp;dicxng the new regime.

I'ne oecona is the accepted characteristic of the Arab, or Kurd for that matter, of sitting on the fence until the po s sTtn.11 1ies of^he situation are m iUll view, ^t may, therefore, be assumea that no major outbreak of internal disorder need be anticipated in tne imiiediate future. 45.

The Prime Minister of Iraq called on 21st February to see me before leaving London to return to Bagdad. 2. After some general observations regarding the Palestine Conference and the evils of political Zionism, General Nuri al Said turned to the position in Syria. He had been asked some weeks ago to convey a message from the Turkish President to the Syrian Government, but he had not hitherto passed on this message. It was to the effect that the Syrian Government should accept the present position as regards the Hatay and cease from making anti-Turkish propaganda in this connexion; the Turkish Government further desired to make it clear that, apart from the Hatay, Turkey had no wish to change her existing frontier with Syria; the message proceeded to affirm that Turkey entertained friendly feelings towards the Syrian Government, and sympathised with them in their present difficulties. It appeared that General Nuri did not now intend to take any action with regard to this Turkish message, since the Syrian Government had resigned in the course of the last few days. The General declared, however, that he was very anxious regarding the position in Syria and thought that the refusal of the French Government to ratify the Franco-Syrian Treaty of His Excellency Sir Maurice Peterson, K.G.M.G,, etc. , etc. , etc, , Bagdad.of 1936 would have very serious consequences. He believed that the anti-Prench feeling in Syria was incited by foreign powers, and he wondered whether, if complete confusion were to prevail in Syria as a result of trouble between the Syrians and the French, the Turks might not seek to take advantage of the situation.. The French were, in his opinion, pursuing a very dangerous policy in Syria and it was partly due to the French that the Damascus Government had so little influence in various outlying districts, such as the Jezireh. 3. I suggested to His Excellency that the Syrian Government would do well in their own interests to keep on the best possible terms with both the French and the Turks, and I understood him to express his general agreement with this view. 4. I then referred to the Iraqi Government's recent request for credit facilities and said that I understood that he had in the course of the last few days had a full discussion with Mr. Nixon, the General Manager of the Sxport Credits Guarantee Department, and that as a result he was arranging for Mr. Hogg, the British financial adviser to the Iraqi Government, to pay a flying visit to London to engage in further financial discussions. General Nuri confirmed this and stated that he had also discussed the situation with a representative of Messrs. Baring. The position briefly was that there were three courses which might be open to the Iraqi Government in this matter; if, as they hoped, they could obtain financial credits from Hisn His Majesty's Government, the resulting contracts would of course be placed with British firms; failing such credits they might decide on a loan, in which case the contracts would be placed with whatever firm offered to supply their requirements on the most advantageous terms, and the orders / might well go to other than British manufacturers; lastly the Iraqi G-overnment might decide simply to cancel their public works programme, in which case also the contracts would be lost to British industry. 5. General Nuri then said that he had received telegrams from Bagdad, including one from King Ghazi, referring to a dispute which had arisen in Xoweit between the Sheikh of Koweit and his Council, and expressing the hope that the Sheikh would not take drastic action against that body. 6. In conclusion General Nuri asked for my views on his Government's idea of negotiating a Treaty of Alliance with Egypt . I informed him that there would be no objection whatever, so far as His Majesty's Government were concerned, to his undertaking such negotiations, but I would ask to be kept informed, of their progress, and to be given an opportunity to study the draft text of any new treaty, if the negotiations reached that stage, in order to have an opportunity of offering comments. General Nuri agreed to this, and explained that his intention was to suggest that the new treaty should be on rather different lines from the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, for he thought it should provide that each country should send troops to the other to assistassist in case of need. The Iraqi Government would be prepared in certain circumstances to send troops to help Egypt if attacked. He hoped that an undertaking from Egypt similarly to assist Iraq would have a steadying and very beneficial effect upon Iraq's relations with Persia. ^ I am, with great truth and respect, c*« Sir, Your Excellency's obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State)-v By Air Mail. p.z.

It was not in Iraqi interests that any activities should be permitted which aimed at undermining basis on which the Government's foreign policy was constructed and such activities would be suppressed regardless of their source. These remarks have everywhere been understood to indicate the Prime Minister 1 s determination to stop German intrigues against Anglo-Iraqi friendship.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 118, Saving, of the 22nd September, I have the honour to submit to your Lordship the following further information concerning the Cabinet changes which were announced on the 21st September. 2. The Prime Minister, whom I saw on the day the changes took place, was reticent and had little to say about his new colleagues except that one was a member of the Shaukat family, one was a Shia (Sadiq Bassam) and one a Kurd (Jalal Baban), and that the latter was an honest man. This last encomium surprised me, as from many others I had heard that in May 1938 Jalal Baban had been forced to resign from Jamil Madfai's Cabinet because of his more than dubious dealings with a Government contractor. 3. I asked about the fate of earlier plans for broadening the basis of the Government by including several ex-Prime Ministers. Nuri Pasha said that this had not been his idea but Jamil Madfai's. His own view was that such a Cabinet could not work harmoniously or be stable. Moreover, Jamil Madfai had made conditions which it had seemed to the Prime Minister to be unwise, or at least premature, to accept. On the other hand, he had arranged that either the Regent or he himself should consult Jamil Madfai on matters of importance, and he hoped, therefore, to obtain Jamil Madfai's general support. 4. Taufiq Suwaidi, who dined with me alone on the 27th September, told me a different story. He said that during the summer Nuri Pasha had sent an intermediary to the Lebanon to visit his brother Naji Suwaidi, Jamil Madfai and himself and to suggest that they and Rashid Ali Gailani and Naji Shaukat should all join the Cabinet. The Suwaidis and Jamil Madfai had accepted this proposal, and Taufiq Suwaidi had undertaken to bring the others into line. Their one condition was that the Prime Minister and his whole Cabinet should first resign, and that they should enter an entirely new Cabinet and not merely join Nuri Pasha's existing Administration. Their reason for this condition was that they did not wish it to appear that they approved of the policy which had been followed by the present Cabinet, many of whose actions were, in their opinion, wrong. When they returned to Bagdad early in September the matter had been reopened with the Prime Minister, but he had told them that he was unable to proceed with the plan as the Regent did not approve of it. He was satisfied, however, that this was only an excuse. I would here interpolate that from other sources I have heard that the plan would have involved the entry of Rashid Ali as one of the ex-Prime Ministers into the new Cabinet, in order that one of the Suwaidis brothers could take his place at the Palace, since there would not be room for both brothers in the Cabinet. As the post at the Palace gives special opportunities for exercising influence not only with the Regent but with his numerous important visitors, it is thought unlikely that Rashid Ali would care to vacate it except to become Prime Minister. He may there fore have inspired the Regent to discourage General Nuri from tendering his resignation, or himself have warned Nuri against the dangers of being double- crossed if he once resigned. Without any warning, however, these dangers may in any case have occurred to General Nuri and his friends. 5. Taufiq Suwaidi went on to say that the additions which had, in fact, been made to the Cabinet by the Prime Minister were all men of the third rank and would bring no strength to the Prime Minister, an opinion with which I am disposed to agree. He added that Nuri Pasha was becoming increasingly unpopular, because of his persecution of all those who had anything to do with Hikmat Sulaiman and Bekr Sidqi, and because he was filling important [730 f—1]2 posts everywhere with incompetent personal adherents. It seemed to him that in these circumstances a change of Government would probably occur before long. 6. I observed that for Iraq's own%ake and for the sake of her reputation abroad, I sincerely hoped that if a change occurred it would be effected constitu tionally, for in these critical days any violent upheaval would be disastrous. What was wanted was a strong Government with a united country behind it, determined, in alliance with Great Britain, to see the war through to a success ful conclusion. Taufiq Suwaidi said that he entirely agreed with me, and he and the others were all avoiding any activity likely to embarrass the Govern ment. On the other hand, it was difficult for them to give real support to Nuri Pasha so long as he persisted in his pursuit of personal vengeance. Here he mentioned Hikmat Sulaiman, and said that he was convinced that the charges brought against him were fabricated, and the evidence on which he had been convicted was false. I asked Taufiq Suwaidi what he thought of Taha-al- Hashimi, the Minister of Defence, and his position in the Cabinet. He said that Taha was an honest, well-intentioned man, but better suited to be Chief of the General Staff than a Minister. The idea that Taha was ambitious and aimed at becoming Prime Minister was dismissed summarily by Taufiq Suwaidi, who said that Taha-al-Hashimi knew well enough that he was not fit to hold such a position. 7. This conversation left me with the impression that the Suwaidis, Jamil Madfai and Naji Shaukat, though possibly they were doing nothing to under mine Nuri Pasha's position, would do nothing to support him, and, in fact, would be glad to see him forced to resign. Rashid's Ali's position is uncertain, but he is most probably playing for his own hand and he may not have forgiven Jamil Madfai and his colleagues for having banished him from Bagdad last December, although his quarrel with them is said to have been composed. 8.

He would not regard such a development with serious apprehension unless foreign (i.e.German and Italian) personnel were to 'be recruited to assist in the process (see in this connection my despatch No.458)# General Nuri said that for the past week the German 'broadcasts had 'been flattering and encouraging Ihn Saud. Nuri explained that he quite appreciated that Ibn Saud was friendly to Great Britain but he feared that nevertheless Ton Saud might attack one of the Hasimite family. He alleged that two of Ibn Saud's 'Syrian advisers 11 Puad Hamza and Yusuf Yasin, were in indirect 'but close touch with German elements including German Minister here, Dr.Grobba through various Syrians in other places such as Iraq, Germany and Italy.

Your telegram No. 315(of September 5tht Relations 'between Iraq, and Egypt. ) In so far as it is practicable, scheme for sending Iraqi troops to Egypt seems open to ohjection from point of view of His Majesty 1 s Government. In particular presence of Iraqi troops in Egypt might raise all sorts of difficulties in regard to British control of armed forces there. 2. There is however every reason to 'believe that contrary to what General Nuri told you, Egyptian Government are lukewarm ahout Iraqi-Egyptian alliance (see Alexandria telegram No. 482) while scheme for sending troops, though it may at first sight appeal to Iraqi vanity, will surely meet with insuperable opposition from Iraq.i Ministry of Defence, who are always complaining ahout their lack of preparedness. I see from your telegram No. 108 Saving (of August 26th) that General Nuri himself recently spoke to you ahout the difficulties of Iraq/s position vis-a-vis Iran and Saudi Arabia. Turkey too is a factor with which Iraqi Government will always have to reckon, and inuernal position in Iraq, would itself seem to preclude despatch of Iraqi troops anywhere abroad. 3. In the circumstances it does not seem necessary for His Majesty's Government to come out irto open opposition1l s. to either scheme at this stage. It v/ould 'be greatly preferable that they should 'be dropped without my intervention since I do not wish to appear unsympathetic to any proposals for co-operation 'between Arah states, even where, as in the present cases, it is most doubtful whether any real advantage of any kind to the participants is involved. 4# You may however certainly continue to point out ohvious objections to Iraqi Government accepting any commitments abroad# In emphasising danger of such commitments you should avoid giving any impression that His Majesty^ Government are not firmly resolved to defend Egypt against all comers and are not fully capable of doing so, or that there would be any grave risk to Iraqti troops sent to Egypt.

PiilRSOlMAL • No.C/172. li Political Agency, Kuwait, March 27th 1941. During the last winter I have been to Iraq., as far as Amarah, a number of times shooting during which trips I have met Iraqi Government Officials, local Shaikhs and others, and a brief account of some impressions may be of interest. 2. The first occasion I had to leave the beaten track was sapping in the bazaars, which I did in the company of an Iraqi who is more British than Iraqi, and who seems to Imow everyone. Time after time we have been stopped by venerable Arabs who have been introduced to me as people of some consequence in the last war and who were employed as agents of some sort. One and all they wanted to be employed again and were delighted to meet a British Official, I had nothing to offer thou of course, but could not help being struck by the loyalty of these men to whom our Consuls meant nothing, whom they did not know, and to whom they could not have spoken had they known them. These men could obviously be usefully employed as spreaders of our news, but that is not Y /hat strikes one most. The pity of it is that hanging about the coffee shops as they apparently must, they should be soured and unknown to the present generation of British Official, when, for the expenditure of a little money they could be doing something useful. 2. On one occasion I travelled by launch which naturally meant tying up for the nights. Always the headman invited us to his village for the evening meal, and always they were delighted to have the honour of serving coffee. The Hon'ble Lieut.-Col. G.G-.

They were obviously friendly or we should not have he en invited and I gathered that they were armed, and they made no hones of saying that they thought their own dovernment corrupt, and much preferred the order we had enforced* 4. The Shaikhs were even more friendly, and did all in their power to make the day f s shooting over their lands a success. SO far as I could make out they were not in contact with any British Official but were outspoken enough to me, and did not try to hide their contempt of their own local officials whose peculations in all matters connected with their land and crops disgusted them and whom they looked upon as a plague of locusts. They were pretty contemptuous of the British, too, for having gained so much at such great cost and for having given it away to a handful of Iraqi families. There was a lot of rainy weather on these trips so we had plenty of time to talk. 5. Beyond the Governor of ^marah the only local official I met was a Police Commissioner, and one or two of his underlings, but they too were friendly and the present of a bcoc of cartridges and an invitation to join a shoot started a train of friendly relations. 6. Just before starting my last trip the return of Cornwallis as Embassador had been announced, and there was much talk of him. lie is, of course, well known, apparently liked and somewhat feared, and the Shaikhs wanted to be in Baghdad to meet him. One man was particularly anxious to get his word in first for Gornwallis had apparently taken a lot of interest in him and the rice /growing3. growing potentialities of his land» Without the British spur his husbandry had been lax, and he had a guilty conscience. 7^ Only once did I meet black looks and that was having crossed over the Tigris, cold and wet, I asked if the villagers could not bring some coffee. The headman said that they did not make coffee, ^uite what he meant I don't know, but I did not 'make the largesse' so he lost as much as we did. That, however is one isolated instance in a winter of pleasant associations.Per s onal. Gonfidential.

I promised to ascertain definitely what could be done by His Majesty's Cxovemrnent so soon as I could report what the Iraqi Government were prepared to do and reminded him of your hope that there would be results within a fortnight. As regards lame argument used by General Taha that Italian Legation had been left because they were harmless I pointed out that as Italy was falling under German domination Legation must be increasingly regarded as a substitute for the German Legation sent away by Government of which Taha had been a member. 3* Taufiq had then had only preliminary talk with Taha but he showed considerable uneasiness at power of military clique. I said that at my next interview I should be glad to learn what Government were willing and able to do observing that obviously the first thing to know was whether effective power was being exercised by present Prime Minister and his G-overnment or by Colonel Salah-ud-din and his clique. In case such language sounds undiplomatic in London I would explain that my experience here goes to show that the more pointedly those hostile to us behind the scenes are exposed and criticised the less support they will receive.

They stated that Taha had refused tequest of the four officers to cancel order transferring Kamil Bhabib to Diwaniyah but that Kamil had been granted three weeks' leave as the Officer Commanding at Diwaniyah had advised that owing to Rashid Ali # s intrigues among the local tribes a change of aonsnanders was for the moment inexpedient* rana assured me that in the meanwhile Kamil was not in command of his former division* 3. Taufiq Suwaidi explained that the Government felt obliged to proceed cautiously in dealing with the military clique because iiashid All was trying to organise a new political party and they did not wish to have too much on their hands at once* Government had decided to refuse permission for formation of this party. 4. Shortly after my return from these visits regent sent me further message to effect that Hlme minister with Cabinet and Presidents of the Senate and Chamber had all visited Palace this morning and had endeavoured to persuade him to accept Taha's propo sal about the officers but that he had not consented. Neither Prime Minister nor Minister for Foreign Affairs told me of incident though it had taken place only a short time before i saw them. I shall see iiegent tomorrow. 5. Prime inister assured me that there was no danger of military action and that he was master of the situation. I fear his assurances cannot be accepted at their face value any more than excuse given for failure of Kamil to proceed at once to Biwaniyah. EMCY. BUSH *P~ P'- No ^&lt;&gt;7 Date.

Bagdad# 11th Jaly# 19i4l* L* Sir, fK* 4 nlil In this despatch I continue the story of current political events from the point at *hieh I concluded my despatch Uo» IW of Jane 6th. 2. The BegenVs return en June Ist was not welcomed by all classes# Rashid Ali's foreeful propaganda had made too deep an ingress ion for so sudden a change of public feeling to be possible* The Army and police were largely sullen and resentful and the people In the streets looked angrily at those who passed on their return frem greeting His Highness at the Palace. Sensttire observers of public feeling forecast trouble and events soon justified them# Shooting, looting and rioting began in the streets of Bagdad about 3 o'clock in the afternoon and continued spasmodically throughout the night# tfhe neat morning (June 2nd) the situation became steadily worse and by about 10 o'clock the mob was out of hand, looting shops at will* Malicious persons deliberately encouraged attacks on Jews. A large number of Jewish shops and homes were looted and several hundred Jews were brutally murdered* The police force was for a time useless* Its discipline had been undermined by the political manipulations and fanatical propaganda of Rashid All's regime, and officers and men joined recklessly with the mob in breaking into and looting shops and houses all over the town# The Lord Mayor who, pending the formation of a new Government, was still nominally in control, begged the Director-General of Police to use hia reserves and to order them to clear the streets and shoot to kill, but the Director-General pleaded that he could not accept responsibility for such drastic action unless specific orders were given by the Regent* After some delay the Regent sent the order in writing and also arranged for the despatch of troops to take control* The soldiers did their work well* There was no more aimless firing Into the airj their machine- guns swept the streets clear of people and quiekly put a stop to looting and rioting* In those few hours however hundreds of families were ruined and brutal outrages were committed which all right minded persons will for long remember with shame and horror* The Jews suffered most, and there is no doubt that a large number of them would emigrate rather than face the risk of another such pogrom if they could only find a country to take them* Many have made pathetic attempts to obtain visas for India for themselves or their families only to find this way of escape now closed* 3. There is evidence to show that the riots were instigated by certain officers in the Army and police who took advantage of the temporary absence of responsible authority. Had a Government heen formed earlier it is in?) rob able that such a serious situation would have arisen# I had at my first interview with the Regent the previous day urged the extreme importance of forming a Cabinet at once and I again impressed on him the necessity for immediate action when I saw him later that afternoon* The Regent was in a difficult position# Jamil Beg Madfai was the only apparent candidate# His name had been put forward by Arshad Beg al Umari and his temporary Committee, and my enquiries failed to reveal anyone else who had the courage and influence to step into the breach# Jamil Beg, however, seemed to have no zest for the part. The Regent had The Right Honourable Anthony Bd®n, M.O., M.F* , Itc., Etc*M* 2 ** had 'been dissatisfied with hie attitude during the later stages of their stay in Palestine and knew that though generally sound in his views, he was an ageing man lacking energy and purpose- fulness and too weak in character to he able to deal firmly with the problems which would face him* His Highneso sought anxiously for alternatives, but found none, and was therefore obliged to call upon Jamil Beg to form a GaMnet# The latter refused and persisted in his refusal all that day. Ifhat night his friends brought pressure to bear on him and the following morning he sent the Lord Mayor and the present Minister of Finance to me with a message that he would accept if I would promise him my full support# This I promised to give and he assumed office when the rioting was at its height. As every minute almost was of importance, the Regent gave him a free hand and on June 3rd the following appointments were announcedJ- Frime Minister. Jamil Madfai, Foreign Affairs. Ali Jaudat-al-Aiyubit Interior. Mustafa al Umari. Gommunications and Works* Jalal Baban. Finance and Justice. Ibrahim Kamal. Economics. Hasrat al Farisi. BAucation. Ridha al Shabibi. Social Affairs. Ja f far Hamudi (appointed a few days later)# k. The new Government had much to do* Their immediate tafcks were to re-establish relations with His Majesty 1 s Government on the basis of the Treaty of Alliance of 1930, to punish rebels and rioters, to discipline the Army, the police and the public services, to stamp out Axis propaganda and to change the heart of a great mass of the people. For two or three days I had prolonged talks with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the essential conditions of a good und.r-stending with Eie Majesty s &amp;overnment and then, after I had formally given notice that in the opinion of His Majesty 's Government a state of imminent danger of war had been reached, the Cabinet on Jane 5th authorised the Minister for Foreign Affairs to comraonieate to me the following decisions:- (a) The Iraqi dovemcoent agree that for the duration of the war, and for war purposes alone. His Majesty s Government may station their ground and air forces at such places as may be necessary for the defence of Iraq, subject to i 1 . he Iraqi Oovermaent's being notified as far as possible in advance (2) due consideration toeing given to such observations as the Iraqi Government may make on account of local administrative necessities, (^) The Iraqi Qovernment agree to establish a postal and telegraphic censorship and to safeguard the interests of His Majesty's Government in these matters by employing in the departrasnt concerned a British official from among those12. - 5 - those In th© service of the Iraqi aorernment. (A later letter informed me that British interests in the control of aliens in Iraq would be safeguarded in a similar manner;. (e) I'he Iraqi Government agree to the British military authorities exercising the necessary meas&amp;re of control in cooperation with the Iraqi authorities over the Base area at Basra and will issue orders to the Basra port authorities to cooperate fully regarding all measures necessary to facilitate and ensure the safe arrival of British forces at Basra. I also received an oral assurance that relations with Italy would be 'broken off. 6. The decision about our troops has, up to the present, given good results. Our forces have moved everywhere without opposition and with few exceptions friendly cooperation has been given by the Iraqi police, military and civil officials. Hews of all movements is passed to the Ministry of Defence through the remaining officers of the Advisory Military Mission who now act as connecting link between Force Headquarters and the Ministry of Defence. 7. The press and postal censorship is beginning to get into its stride and with the tactful use of the trained staff which the Middle Bast Command is providing it should become more effective before long. 8. Details of the British cooperation which it is desirable to establish at Basra both in the 1?ort and the Base areas are being studied and in the meanwhile the provisional arrangements In operation are working reasonably well* q. He la t ions with Italy were formally broken off on 8th June and the Italian Minister and his staff leftfor Turkey via Syria on the following toy. The Japaaese Attach, installed daring May has heen obliged to leave and -the Japaaes. Qovemment have been informed that their present Minister ia persona non grata to the Segent. 10. To deal with the werst rebels and rioters military eoarts have been set up in Mosni and Bagdad and a large nuiriber of persons ineluding many of Rash id All s oats tending eapporters have been suBiaarily arrested. A new Elrefltor-Qeneral of Police has been appointed, and many Army officers have been placed on pension. Troublesome Palestinians and Syrian teachers have been packed off to their homes and new Matasarrifs have been appointed to most Liwas. These measares have to some extent itBDroved the situation bat they have not been carried oat with enough energy to make them fully effective. 11. The deafcrture of the Mufti and the Italian IiSgatlen has deprived pro- Axis and anti-British propaganda ot its motive force but the adherents of Rash id Ali, the many convinced pro- Uazis in the Army and the public services and the irrecoverable anti-British elements in all parts of the country are maintaining a widespread opposition to the Government and their endeayoura to cultivate a public spirit more friendly towards Great Britain.12# The Government began their own propaganda campaign very warily and I had naxch to do to persuade them to quicken and strengthen it. Gradually they gained confidence and by the end of June both in the press and on the radio they were attacking their opponents with good effect. ITheir handling of the soldiers and officials has been less successful and too many prominent supporters of Raehid Ali's regime have been released from prison after only a few days* detention. The Government are now talking of an internment cans? for the worst of their political opponents and this seems to be the only solution of a difficult problem. The Goverziraent are al^o ;: h collecting evidence for impeachment of lashid Ali and his Cabinet a for treason and have taken powers to try them in absentia, tfp to the present no action has been taken against Rashid Ali f s chief tribal supporters, a fact which is causing resentment among those who remained loyal to the Regent. 13. fhe Government have made a creditable attest to improve their representation abroad. The Minister at Angora, the Charge d 1 Affaires at Kabul, the Consul-General at Beirut, and several consuls and secretaries known for their pro-German activities have been recalled and a new Minister has been sent to Tehran who it is hoped will bring pressure to bear on the Iranian Government to impose effective restrictions on Rashid Ali, the Mufti, the Golden Square and their followers, now refugees in Iran. liw Southern Kurdistan is providing a further difficult problem for an already much embarrassed administration. Shaikh Mahmud, the outstanding Kurdish tribal leader, escaped from his forced detention in Bagdad towards the end of May. From 1923 until his surrender in 1931 he fought continuously against all established authority, British or Iraqi, in the name of Kurds ish independence and 10 years of exile from his own hills have evidently wrought little change in his proud and unruly character. After his escape he returned to hie oid haunts in Sulaimani and having gathered fighting men around him was about to attack Sulaimani when the Bashid Ali Government fell» The restoration by British forces of a constitutional Government offered a prospect of syo^&gt;athetic British intervention in Kurd*ish interests and Shaikh Mshmud held off his attack to see what eooXd be gained by negotiation. The Governaent thereupon sent a Kurdish official, Mustafa Qaradaghli to talk with him and at the same time collected forces in Sulaimani as a warning# Shaikh Mahmud* s proposals included the transfer to the Kurds themselves of the control of law and order, the administration of the Kurdeish districts through a locally appointed comrnittee of Kurds and the creation of a special voluntarily enlisted force for garrison duties in the KordAsh districts. These proposals were unacceptable to the Iraqi Government, who saw in them a long first step towards Knraish automony. The also felt, with good reason, that Shaikh Mahmud with his out-of-date tribal outlook on political questions and his treacherous nature was not a man with whoa any lasting arrangements could be concluded. They therefore adopted the plan of detaching his tribal allies by offers of concession to their local interests and of depriving him of any support which the educated Kurds might otherwise give to him by attempting to redress their grievances. The Kurds have long complained of the deliberate neglect of the Bagdad Government and there is a widespread feeling that the present moment is propitious to extort concessione. SomeSome Kurds go so far as to dream of automony fftiile others would be satisfied with real equality within the Iraqi State* Some, like Shaikh Mshmud, still apparently hope that Great Britain will even yet see that the Kurds have a fair deal and are never tired of telling us how much better friends they would have been to us than the Arabs, for whom we have done so much and from whom we have received so little gratitude. Others take the line that the Kurds obviously do not fit into British policy and that it would be foolish to expect us to upset the Arabs for the blue eyes of the Kurds and that if ever they are to have a future as a nation they must fight for it thetnselves# The Iraqi plan for dealing with the immediate manifestation of this chronic element of internal unrest is in principle sound and if carried out in a generous and sympathetic spirit will probably succeed. But the Prime Minister is bigotedly anti-Kurd* and onlikely to handle the problem with friendliness and foresight. The Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, en expert in Kurdish affairs, tells me that in dAscussions with Iraqi politicians he frequently senses in some of them a vindictive feeling that they would prefer to lose Kurdistan rather than secure them as loyal Iraqis by acknowledging their existence qua Kurds J they are ready to contemplate evacuation of the Kurdistan areas but never a really liberal policy. Shaikh Mahmud sent a confidential messenger to me with good wishes and protestations of obedient friendship towards His Majesty's Govemmant. I returned thanks with a pointed reminder that in this time of war His Majesty^ Government did not wish to be burdene d wi th troub les in I ra q and that in^he 30 !arge^British^forces now in Iraq they had the means to put a stop to any sueh embarrassments to their war effort. Fo/ the moment the situation is quiet; Shaikh Mahmud has promised to disperse his armed band and the Government have given him oermission to live in one of his villages near Sulaimani/ It cannot be hoped, however, that this truce will last for long* 15* People of all classes in Iraq continue to follow external events with close interest but recent war developments have not greatly influenced Iraq's internal affairs. The Free French declaration of the independence of Syria and the Lebanon made on Jane 6th and the declaration of His Majesty's Government associating themselves therewith were both well received and well advertised by the Iraqi Government. ®icee statement® of policy gave confidence to our friends but did not appreciably change the views of the solid mass of our onstinate enemies. Your own Mansion House statement on British policy towards the Arabs and their national aspirations made an excellent impression at the time but it is, I fear, now beginning to be forgotten and it would be good from all points of view that an early opportunity should be sought to have it recalled and repeated in an authoritative manner# Germanlt 1 s attack on Russia is regarded by many as increasing British chances of victory but the pro-GermaBS have been working hard to convince everybody that Russia will quickly collapse and leave the road to India open to the German Army. 16. To sum up the general situation I would say that though they have made some progress the Government have not yet consolidated their poeitioru The tribes are quiescent and their leaders are for the most pert f riendlybut Army is a potential element of danger. There the bitterness ofof defeat still kindles the fires of hatred of the British tinder the ashes of appeasement, and news of the eastern march of German forces might well be taken as a signal fbr a fresh attempt to destroy onr position In this country. I am myself taking all possible steps to make such a possibility more remote. After a long period of ostracism, the way to the Imba&amp;sy is now open and . I have visitors — tribal and others - from all over the country. With the reorganisation of our propaganda machine and the activities of the newly formed political Advisory staff, I have hopes of regaining an appreciable portion of the ground which we have lost throughout the country. Much will depend on the length of the present respite and on the coarse of the war but granted reasonably frood fortune, I see no reason why we should not be able to place ourselves in a far stronger position to resist any subversive attack against us from within the country in the future. The future of the Regent and of his GovermaBnt is linked with ours in this matter. I am doing what I can to strengthen them and have enlisted their support for my plane. 17» X am sending copies of this despatch to Mr. Oliver Lyttleton at Cairo, Hie Majesty 1 s Eepresentatives at Angora, Cairo, Tehran and Jedda, His Majesty^s High Commissioner for Palestine and Transfer don, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Koweit, His Ma^osty s Consale at Basra and Kosal, the Gen«ral Officer Cofflnanaing- In-Chief Mldflle Saet, the Conmanaer-ln-Chlef Bast I n ai.s Sgcs-aroR, the Oeneral Officer COMnanding British Troops in irao. the Air Officer Corraiar.ding Royal Air Force Habbanlya, the CotnbLned Middle Bast Intelligence Oentres, Cairo and Ira the Jerusalem Bureau and to the Government of India.

At the moment, however, all I have been able to secure is a promise of strict er surveillance. 3.

Please repeat to Cairo and Bagdad.Ho&gt; 19 0 (265/3/42) British Embassy, Bagdad. 24th January, 1942 Sir, Parliament reassembled on January 17th after an adjournment of six weeks. At the first two meetings no 'business was done as a quorum was not present. The recess has passed quietly, and the principal matters of concern has 'been the cost of living, the trial of Rashid Ali and his associates, the interpretation of certain Articles of the organic Law and the review of Iraq/s position in the war. 2. prices of essential articles show little improvement. Maximum prices for matches, tea, coffee, sugar, wheat and barley and certain grades of cotton goods have been fixed by the central supply B 0 ard but merchants are generally selling only low quality stocks at the fixed prices. T^e better quality is obtainable at a hi^ier price by private arrangements. The price of the best quality wheat was fixed early in January at l.D*4o a ten and the lowest quality (with 15% of dirt) at i«d*34. The price of flour has however remained uncontrolled and has now exceeded i.d .3 per loo kilos. t M s is a very high price for the poor to pay, in Bagdad the Mayor endeavoured to organise the sale of restricted quantities at a lower price. He was obliged however to give up the experiment as he found that without rationing it was impossible to prevent abuses. He is now trying to organise adequate supplies of controlled price bread instead, but is confronted with the difficulty of having a stock of wheat only big enou^i to last until the end of February. 3. A British expert is now helping the Iraqi authorities to solve their supply and distribution problems but so far as can be judged from the available information it will be impossible to find enough grain to feed the people in the towns unless a large quantity can be imported from abroad. such supplies can only be obtained tM»ough the good offices of His Majesty's Government and j have in several telegrams represented to you, sir, the gravity of the situation which will arise if wheat is not speedily made available for this country® T^e people in villages and settled tribal areas have generally speaking enough foodstuffs to keep them alive until the next harvest, but in the towns there are thousands of families who had not money enough to lay in supplies in advance for the winter and THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ANTHONY EDM, M.CN , MoP. , ETC., ETC., ETC,9- find who are dependent for their aailjr bread on small pnrchaaee. Tlie steudy rise in the price of flour and all other foodstoffs has hit these people hard and if adequate snppliee within their meana fail they will be faced with starvation* I4* The result of the trial by 0015rt martial of Eashid All and his associatea was published on January 6th.

As yon are aware, the actual position of the accused persons la that Hoahid All la in Berlin, Waj i Shenkat and M^haawiad Hassan Hal man are in &gt; i key, while the remainder with the exception of Salahad .Lin Sabbagh, whose whereabouts are unknown, are on their way to lionthern Rhodesia for Internment. 6. On January 20th the Iraqi aovemai^nt made a formal written application for the snrrender of all of the above- mentioned persons who are now in the handa of His Majesty*a Government (except Abdol Q.&amp;dlr yallani, who la charged with a minor offence). The prise Minister informed me orally that the Cabinet resolution to ta*.€ this step had been passed unanimously ana that it had at the same time been resolved that if any of these men wera acquitted after their return to Iraq they should fee interned at ao* 7. The prime Minister confessed to me privately however that he was doebtfV* 1 of the wisdoca of giving fnli effect at once to the Cabinet's re so In t ion and I agreed with his view that it wonId be better to have back first those who# had been sentenced and to let the others come later on if the sttnation continued to be favurrable. I have, therefore, as yo« are already aware from cay telegram Wo. 70, proposed that All LiahiUnd al Shaikh All, Ynnia Sabawl, Am in Sakl Otis la iman, Pahtai Said, Mahrmd ^al-sian and Jiddlq Shanghai shall be surrendered as soon as possible while the others are detained for a while In 3Onth Africa. 8. Oince the annonncement of the sentences I have made careful enqr ir las thron^iont the country Into the state of public feeling regarding the handing over of the convicted men and the execution of their sentences. sports show that there has been a considerable hardening of opinion against these men do ring the last month and that 00 seriorrs trouble is expected ®s the result of sr-ch action.- 3 - o In paragraph 10 of ray despatch No. 3U9 of December lUth I mentioned the Prime Minister 1 b declared wish to strengthen the authority of parliament# During the recent parliamentary recesis he has t e n » nil Ln^ possibilities of i oli g thl£ within the framework of the Organic Law- The High Court (consisting of four Senators and four Judges) provided for m Article 3 of the Organic Law has been called upon to reply to the following questions touching the interpretation of Articles 20 and 22 of the Constitution. (1) Would the addition of certain rights to the established rights of the King during the period of Regency be an infringement of the King f s prerogatives ? (2) If the male descendants in direct line to his late Majesty the King Faisal should cease can a female descendant in the direct line become heir to the Throne ? and if not, would it be within the rights of the nation to settle this matter ? (3) Would the creation of the post of Depnty or Assistant Minister, to be held by a member of Parliament, be contrary to the ConsUtution ? 10» The following decisions were given by the High Court (1) The grant of new rights to the King would not contravene Article 22 of the Organic Law. This articles forbids the modification of the King's prepogatives during a regency. The assignment of additional rights to the King would not be a modification within the meaning of this article. (2) A female cannot succeed to the Throne and, if, which God forbid, there should be no male heir to the Throne, the decision to be taken would rest with the nation under Article 19* (3) The creation of the post of Deputy or Assistant Minister from among members of Parliament is not lawful for it would weaken the legislative power. (The underlying idea of this somewhat ambiguous decision seems to be that if each Minister could appoint a Deputy or Assistant the influence of the Cabinet over the Senate and the Chamber would be much increased because of the powerful patronage which the Cabinet would thereby control within the two Houses.) 11. Questions concerning Articles 55&gt; 31 and 119 of the Organic Law have also been referred to the High Court for interpretation. 12» The Organic Law itself is meanwhile being studied by a special committee with a view to the elimination, by amendment, of the defects which have been revealed by experience. The Committee consists of 12 members, ex-Ministers and Judges, under the Presidency of Jamil Madfai. 13. Reports which have reached me from Political Advisers and other sources show that there are still too many pro-Nazis and anti-British Iraqi civil officials and Army officers at large in the northern liwas. Most of them appear to be inactive at present but they represent a potentially hostile element ana- 4 - I shall continue to make strong representations to the Prime Minister for their removal# I am also pressing for action against a number of undesirable teachers and officials who still remain andistorbed in the Ministry of Education and its varions schools# It is impossible to deal with all those persons who showed hostility when Nazi influence was in the ascendant but in spite of the fact that too many remain untouched, there is no donbt that the general political atmosphere in the country has greatly improved* Cooperation between the British and Iraqi forces is excellent and social intercourse is enconraged by the higher command on each side# A joint Anglo-Iraqi survey of certain features of the desert area south of the Euphrates between Jalal ifanf and Ramadi ^ is now being carried out and the Mosul Municipality have given their new Town Hall for nse as a Service club for British troops# llj.# The Prime Minister has been thinking a good deal^ lately about Iraq^ position in the war# Fro' 1 the beginning he has had faith in an Allied victory and has seen elsearly that Iraq could expect few positive benefits from such a victory unless she played, in some measure, an active part in the fight against Nazism, While those who believed in a Nazi victory favoured re-insurance with the Reich, Nuri Said has always inclined towards the building up of a substantial credit account with the Allies on which Iraq conId cash in when the time came for peace settlements. This was the basis of his early schemes for a token Iraqi force in the western desert and though political and military opposition to such a project was too strong for him he has never given up the hope of finding some way of improving Iraq's position at the peace conference by finding a part for her to play in the war. He quickly appreciated the importance for the Ar^h countries (especially Iraq, Syria and Palestine) of the Atlantic Charter and more recently h^ has seen the opportunity which is offered by the 26 poer anti-Axis Pact concluded at Washington at the beginning of the year# He has accordingly been sounding his colleagues and some of the senior politicians now out of office, with a view to obtaining their agreement to Iraq's adherence to this Pact and the concurrent declaration of a state of war between Iraq and Italy and Germany# He no donbt feels that Iraq's ultimate claims to the rights and privileges recognised by the Aiiantic Charter will thereby be strengthened. He may also hope that if Iraq signs the Pact the United States of America may extend the Lease-Lend Act to her. He would like Saudi Arabia to take the same step at the same time but he is awaiting the advice of His Majesty's G -overnment before making any proposals to King Ibn Saud. 15. Iraq's position vis-a-vis Syria has also been under consideration and as you already know the Prime Minister informed me about the middle of January that the Iraqi Government would be willing to recognise the Syrian and Lebanese Governments if the Free French authorities announced that the present arrangements are only temporary and that at the end of the war the Syrian and Lebanese will be free to choose what form of government shall be set up in their respective countries# 16. The French Minister, his family and the Legation staff left Iraq at the end of December# The remainder of the JapaneseJapanese Legation staff remained pending a decision as to the ronte to be chosen for their repatriation and arrangements T-PF ^l^se of British diplomatists in Japanese hands* All Japanese property in Iraq was brought under official control soon after the Japanese declaration of war on the 17» The Iraqi Government have nnder consideration a draft Treaty of Friendship with China# The Prime Minister informs me that this does not involve an exchange of diplomatic missions* 18* I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty T s Representatives at Angora, Cairo, Tehran, Jedda, The Minister of State, Cairo, His Majesty^ High Commissioner for Jerusalem and Transjordan, the Governor-General of India, the Commander-in-Chief India, General Headquarters, Middle East, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, | the Political Agent, Koweit, and to His Majesty's Consols at Basra and Mosai* I have the honour to be, with the highest respect.

This Law replaces Regulation ito.58 of 1939 governing Economic Life during the International Crisis, confers far reaching powers on the Minister of Finance and is coinprehensive in scope. Its intention is to prevent monopolies and the manipulation of prices of commodities and to maintain supplies of commodities required for normal life. For these purposes exports and imports may he restricted, importation hy merchants prohibited if the Government decide to undertake importation of eertain «omiaolities themselves, trade restricted oy licence and prices of comrjiodities fixed. The most important powers conferred by the Law are, however, those authorising the Government to tal^e possession of coiamodities and to sell them at fixed prices, to take over flour mills and factories and to operate then: for the use of the aovemment. In addition, the (jovernment may control means of transport with the exception of animals actually employed in agriculture. Lastly, provision is made for compulsory labour service 'by empowering the Government to take labour from its normal work and employ it on the production of commoditiee lor the use of the Government, which may also fix wages. v.. . 3m Provision is made for compensation for requisitioned coimaodities and factories, workshops, means of transport etc. in accordance with the decision of the Higher Supplies Oommittee. This Committee, which takes over the functions of the old Central Supplies Committee, is under the jurisdSction of the Ministry of Finance and under the chairmanship of the Minister. Its membership has been established as follows:*- Mr. L.1U Swan (Adviser to Ministry of Pinance) Mr. O.H. Loggin (Adviser to liinistry of Communications ^ Works) Major Page (Director of Supplies) Saiyid Arshad al Umari (Mayor of Bagdad) Saiyid George Georgi (Director-General of Customs cc Excise) Saiyid Abdul Ilah Hafidh (Director-General of Hevenues). Saiyid Ali Jafer (Director of Income-Tax and Supervision) Saiyid Abdul Hamid Rafat (Director-General of Interior) Saiyid Mohmmad Balin al Radihi Jirector-GcBcral of Agriculture) Saiyid Antun Shammas (Head of the Codification Department) 4. For the tiiiie being the name of 'Central Supplies Committe#' is being retained. It has been reorganised and all trade members eliminated# It is now a more compact and efficient body than when it functioned under the Hinistry of Economics. It was then subject to well-warrantcd criticism. aub-Commlttees have been set up dealing respectively with exports, local supplies, local production and imports, the latter being dealt with by the Central Imports Committee. . , 5.

He hoped to ersuade Taufiq Auwaidi to accept tiie Ministry of Foreign Affairs and help him to bear the burden of the i' aril amen tary work which he had found so exhausting during the last session and he had an eye on two or three suitable men to complete the required If ihia n quota.

He wanted most of the old *41 nister^ including Aallh Jabr and ^bdul ■ wahdi to- be dropped and to introduce men such as limar Masmi and Mustafa si ilmari with whom ,uri ^asha knew that it would be impossible for him to work in hsmony. Furthermore, he was dissatisfied with the offer of the . inistry of Foreign Affaire unless he could also have the title of deputy Prime Minister (for which there is no constitutional provision) and asked for either Interior or Finance for himself. He spoke in disparaging terms of the late Government's policy of close cooperation withifis I'a lest v* s Government and declared that Nuri Pasha was retaining lalih Jabr only because the British had told him to do so. mi SIOHT HQKaOHABLA 5# mmm mm, M#c. 9 II.P # , ETC., J-TG.19 ♦ the Aulad Faisal and a number of the followers on each side were killed. The forces engaged were so large and well-amed that the Iraq.! police in a nearby post were afraid to intervene ana the contractors in the neighbourhood were so unnerved that they suopped. work and for some time refused to go back to this part oJ; tne road. Owing to a lack; of proper understanaing 'between the Mutasarni at Mosul and the Minister of the Interior an unduly long cielay occurred before this affair was deal with and it was not until uctoDer ^na tnax the principal participants were brought into mosuI and locked up. So soon as this was done the contractors were able to resume worx but further disciplinary measures will have to oe taken before trie unruMness of the Shammap is satisfactorily curbed. 13 # The cognate quarrel of the Shammar with the Yezidi^ shaikh^ Daud-i-Daud has not yet been fully settled by the Iraqi Government and peace between the two tribes is only preserved by detaining Baud-i-Daud in Sulaimani: an arrangement that cannot be prolonged indefinitely. II4.. Dohuk and Armadiyah have not yet been altogether freed fro, the marauding bands which have intimidated the villages for so long. On August 25th fifteen men raided the Assyrian village of Barzangl in the Armadiyah district, brutally murdered a priest and looted his house# Only one arrest has so far been made for this crime but about forty men are now awaiting trial for other outrages committed by these gangs. 15» During the latter part of the summer the Biwaniyah Liwa was the scene of a number of tribal conflicts, the worst of which took place on September 9th, wban a body of men of the Aqra tribe attacked five of the Khazail and, having killed them all, mutilated their bodies. Police intervention stopped the spread of the fighting but the temper of both tribes remains hot and their future action un- certain. Their quarrel, like so many on the Euphrates, is an old one and the Aqra state that their treatment of the Khazail dead was retaliation for a similar outrage committed by K^azailis on Aqra men five years ago. These disturbances have 110 major political signif icance but they show how wild and brutish the great part of the population still is and give sinister point to the reports which I receive of the large number of rifles and cartridges which the tribes in all parts of the country have secured for themselves during recent years. 16. On the night of August 29tiV30th the railway line near Hillah was blown up by a percussion bomb of some kind as a train was passing. Little damage was done and no casualties were caused. Those respons ible have not yet been traced and it has not yet been established what type of bomb or mine had been placed under the track. 17. In late .September there was a serious outbreak of agrarian trouble in the Hai in the Kut Liwa. Men of the A1 Aid tribe raided sheep belonging to a neighbouring Sadun landlord who had refused tlv~ 1 permission to pass a canal through his land to the river, '/hen he A a relative went with two policemen to recover the sheep the tribesmen ambushed and killed most of the party. The tribal leaders rejected a twenty-four hours 1 ultimatum to submit and in a fight with the police that followed the tribesmen were dispersed and are thought to have lost about eighty men killed and serious(ywounded. The police casualties wei-e eight men killed and twenty-five wounded. 18. The Re rent went to Amman on August 31st to visit his uncle the Anir Abdullah and remained until September 8th. During his absence a Council of Regency exercised the Royal prerogatives on his behalf.

I have today returned and resumed charge of His Majesty^ Embassy# - C0R1TWAIIIS - \Uje^ *- 2 - already contributing to the war effort of the United Nations^ all that is required to qualify her for inclusion in their ranks, she may as well take her place there properly and thereby gain the rights and privileges of full membership, including those set out in the Atlantic Charter* iSuri Pasha is convinced that such action on Iraq 1 part would have a profound effect in all Near and Middle Eastern countries, and indeed among Arabs everywhere. Whether, in the event, Iraq's belligerency will be greeted with joy by the mass of the people - whose pleasure over recent Allied victories was based to an appreciable extent upon the assumption that the danger cf war was receding - remains to be seen* I personally think not* 5* More spontaneous interest is being shown by both Houses of Parliament in the question of the control and distribution of supplies and the fate of the political internees. At a meeting held on November 14th at which a number of speakers appealed to the Government to show clemency towards these victims of their political views, the Prime Minister stated that the Government had set up a committee to review the cases of individual internees and to classify them in three categories; those who could be set free immediately, those on whom the restraint imposed could be lightened and those who would have to be kept in internment until such time as they could be released without danger to the public interest* 6* The committee formed for this work is presided over by the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior and includes the (British)Technical Adviser to the Criminal Investigation Department and the Director-General of Police* Mr* Edmonds tells me that though the Committee may recommend the release of a few men interned as a punishment for petty political offenees, such as abusive talk in public about the Allies or members of the Iraqi Government, they will not advocate the setting free of any of those who played an important part in anti-British or pro*Axis plotting or agitation. There may indeed be something to be said in favour of releasing the nonentities who have been interned for petty offences and if it were certain that the Government would not go beyond the Committee's recommendations, there would be little need for anxiety. I fear, however, that much pressure is being brought to bear on the Prime Minister to release not the unimportant but the influential and well-connected internees and although in the present state of public opinion such people would be far less dangerous than they were at the time of their internment, it is still in my opinion premature to release them. It may be true that the political atmosphere is now unfavourably for their activities, but they would find little difficulty in exploiting against ourselves and the present Iraqi regime the economic discontent to be found everywhere in tfee country, and might well endeavour to do so*7. I tore spoken firmly to the Prime Minister on the folly of yielding to pressure conceding these people, tmt I have the impresaion that he 1$ now anxious to try to 'appease 11 his opponents and X think that he may also have in mind, to rally the nationalists ready 'for the post war effort to set something substantial for th«* Arabs out of TOT peace« S.

The only measures tmt stand to the credit of the administration arc the prohibition of the export of barley and order© for the collection In kind of the land tax on wlwat and rice in certain provinces. Fortunately, either because they have stocks of food or are earning wages high enough to compete with current priees. most of the people seem so far to be imnaging f44rly well and apart from one or two minor and easily settled strikes there has been no disorder caused by omamSk distress. It is nevertheless noticeable that Coiaaunism is gaining adherents particularly asong educated your^g men, Tm strong appeal Mitch its ■ doctrines now make with their promise of easy panaeeas for inequalities of wealth and ' all econosdc troubles is, of course, being reinforced by recent Russian military' successes an^. by the strength which has been developed by ceaocratic propaganda^ if Ba^lsm is destroyed Comunisn will certainly be a considerable political force in this countty after the Allied victory. It is, incidentally, being fanned by the sense of frustration induced among the more youthful of the politically-ialrided by their persistent inability to break into the eharmed circle of public life, the entrances to which remain closely guarded by an ageing group of conservative politieians, 10, It has become a ccommonplace of current reports from Middle -Eastern countries to refer to the profound effect mad© on public opinion by the victories of the Blgtith /J»y followed by the ^lo-^merican occupation of Morocco and Algiers, In Iraq the swing of the pendultim has been so inarked that mm people seem to thinlc that the war is now all over bar the shouting, and to foster a store balariced appreciation of the facts our local propagandists' have had t&amp; give up emphasising the good points in cur war position and ' to stress instead the heavy fighting that' still lies ahead before victory can be won.

The Iraqi Government should notify the United States Government (possibly inan en clair telegram from the Prime Minister to the President) of their desire to accede. Since we know the United States Government are prepared to agree, I see no reason why immediate publicity should not be given to this step* Please explain the position to the Prime Minister*,On December 16th the Ministry of Finance 'brought under official control the three woollen cloth mills in Bagdad and concluded arrangements with the owners whereby they would manufacture two qualities of cloth to be sold at fixed prices of 600 fils per 500 grammes for the first quality, and 500 fils per 500 grammes for the second quality. Work on this cloth began on January 3rd. No exact figures are yet available but the maximum output of these plants is probably about 2^0,000 square metres yearly A few days later the Bagdad soap factory was similarly taken over.

The Minister had been nursing as a particular grievance for which there was some justification the idea that^the Army were imposing too great a strain on the transport and supplies of the country, but he was well pleased with the sympathetic and helpful attitude of the Commander-in-Chief who promised the following help:- (a) to reduce from' 800 to 600 the 'ceiling' of Iraqi lorries used for military haulage; (b)^ to supply tyres and parts to keep civilian motor vehicles on the road, provided that their use for essential work was ensured by official control; (c) to explore the possibility of enabling United Kingdom Commercial Corporation vehicles to assist in transporting cereals for the Iraqi Government whenever military'exigencies permit. 6. On January l6th on the first day of the reassembling of Parliament after a six weeks' adjournment, the Prime Minister informed the Chamber that in accordance with a resolution passed on November 12th the Government were arranging for Iraq to adhere to the Declaration of the United Nations made at Washington on January 2nd, 194-2, and explained that as this adherence made it necessary for Iraq to declare war, the Regent had issued a Hoyal Iradah proclaiming the existence of a state of war between Iraq and the Axis Powers as from midnight on January l6/17th. The events and discussions that led up to this development have been fully reported by telegraph and need not be repeated here. Little of note was said in the few speeches that followed the Prime Minister 1 s announcement and most speakers approved of Iraqis declaring war in order that she and all the Arabs should enjoy to the full, the benefits of the Atlantic Charter, but neither Nuri Pasha nor anyone elne indulged in any eloquence on the contribution Iraq could make to hasten the Allied victory. Indeed one might conclude from their published statements that the Government do not consider themselves under any obligation to do more than abide by the terms of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. It will be my endeavour to explode this_comfortable theory if it really exists. The public both in the capital and the provinces received the news with a calm that was near to 'indifference.

The Regent left Iraq for Egypt on December 17th accompanied by the Prime Minister, tp visit the battlefront of the Western Desert. They both returned on January 2nd much impressed by what they had seen and delighted with the kindness and courtesy shown to them by the Commander-in-Chief. During his stay in Cairo Nuri Pasha found several opportunities to encourage hopes that closer union and collaboration would be achieved by Arab countries after the war. 15. Professor Mohammed Sadiq Johar, a senior official of the Egyptian Education Service, arrived in Bagdad on Jauary 14th to take up the post of Director-General in the Ministry of Education. The late co-Directors-General, Dr. Sami Shaukat and Dr. Fadhil Jamali, have been appointed respectively Director-General of Health and Social Affairs and Counsellor at the Iraqi Legation in Washington. Their departure from the Ministry of Education was long overdue and is greatly to be welcomed. The Government have not yet decided what powers to give to Sadiq Johar, and no doubt there will be many delays and hesitations in giving effect to Professor Hanley's reforms, which, however, have been agreed in principle by the Cabinet. 16. Early in the New Year the Iraqi Minister at Angora reported that the Turkish court to which the Iraqi demand for the extradition of Salah-ud-Din Sabbagh had been referred had ruled that sufficient evidence had not been put forv/ard to justify his surrender. The Prime Minister was much annoyed by this decision and holding that the action of the Turkish court has render it valueless he is considering the possibility of cancelling the special clause of the Turkish Iraqi Extraiditon Treaty which makes attempts against the Heads of the State an extraditable offence. 1?. In 1^38 the Persian Government closed Iraqi schools in Khuzistan. Since then sporadic efforts have been made by the Iraqi Government to persuade the Persian Government to allow the schools to be reopened but without success. On November 17th 1942 at the instance of the Minister for Foreign Affairs the Cabinet decided to retaliate by closing Persian schools in Iraq. It seems that unduly precipitate action was taken on this resolution. Police were sent to the Persian schools and informed the Headmasters that they must close their schools within 24 hours. The Persian Minister at once protested to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and gained from him a month's respite for further negotiations. The Persian Minister argues that in Persia the Government closed all foreign schools, not only Iraqi schools, whereas the Iraqi Government are discriminating in an unfriendly manner by only ordering the closing of Persian schools. To this the Iraqis reply that there are no other schools in Iraq maintained by a foreign Government. My latest information is that the Persian Government is yielding and that the matter is likely to be settled in a manner favourable to Iraq.IDOCUMENTS R alatinq to thk ADHERENCE OF IRAQ TO THK DECLARATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS Signed at Washington on 2nd January, 1942 BAGHDAD PRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT PRESS, 1943,I a4* C ONTENT S, €i — 1.

The Council also considered a memorandum submitted by the Prime Minister No. 125 dated llth January, 1943. In view of the hostile attitude which has been adopted for a long time by the Axis Powers against Iraq and of the continued activities through their agents for the destruction of the legitimate Iraqi Govern ment and of the pressure brought to bear on the Iraq Parliament (as revealed in the Parliamentary Resolution adopted by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate on llth November, 1941, and 15th November, 1941 respectively) and in view of the openly hostile action taken by them during May, 1941. And in view of the persistence of the Axis Powers in their hostile attitude from then to the present time by the attacks directed against Iraq and her interests through their broadcasting stations; and in view of their continued efforts to create differences and dissensions between the various communities of Iraq, with the object of endangering public security and public order by spreading false rumours and lying news through their Broadcasting Stations as well as by all other means avail able to them. And in view of the fact that the Broadcasting authorities of the Axis Powers openly and unceasingly use abusive expressions which are intended to impair the dignity of the Royal Family and so undermine the loyalty of the Iraqi people; and also in view of the fact that the Axis Powers encouraged those persons who defied the law and attemp ted to overthrow the Constitutional System of their country by force of arms and have, after the escape of these persons from Iraq, harboured and maintained them. And whereas the interests of Iraq in particular and of the Arab peoples in general make it imperative that Iraq should adhere to the Declaration of the United Nations signed at Washington on 2nd January, 1942, which was based on the Atlantic Charter signed by the President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on the 14th of August, 1941, and this in view of the lofty principles embodied in the said document, guaranteeing to all peoples, small or great, their liberties and independence, as well as their integrity. After the perusal of Article 26 (8) of the Organic Law, the Council passed the following resolution: — ii) Iraq shall be deemed to be in a state of war with the three Axis Powers. Hi) Iraq shall adhere to the Declaration of the United Nations signed at Washington on January 2nd, 1942,MENORANDUM SUBMITTED BY H. E THE PRIME MINISTER, No. 125 DATED 11-M943 1. The principal foundations upon which any democratic state should stand may be outlined as follows:— (a) A definite system of government determining the basic institutions and powers of the state concerned and ensuring her progress towards the realisation of her own ideals, the establishment of justice therein and the development of her vital resources in the political, administrative, constructive, economic, social and other fields. Such a system is usually ensured by an organic law which stipulates that the conduct of the affairs of the state shall be under the supervision of a parliament whose designation and composition vary with different states. (b) A head whom the people entrust with the supreme leader ship of the country and who is invested with powers enabling him to direct the policy of the state and control the proper functioning of the machine thereof in adcordance with its constitution and the laws derived therefrom. (c) A force composed of all the various armed services to safe guard the integrity of the state and defend the country against any internal or external menaces. In the present age such a force is, as a general rule, supported by international re lations which ensure the safety of the st^te and which are reinforced by treaties and pacts whereby the slate is linked with certain other sta es to whom it is drawn closer by com mon interests and conformity of aims. Recently, such international relationship has become very important not only in the case of small and new states, but also in the case of great powers no matter how large and powerful they may be, such as the allied and the axis powers which hive been interre ated with a network of treaties all of whichaim at safeguarding the existence and ensuring the safety and interest of the state concerned. One must look forward to the gradual expansion of these international relationships as, owing to the increased complexity and development of inter national interests due to modern inventions it is quite impossible for any single state to live isolated from the rest of the world. Any impairment in the above foundations in any state will inevitably threaten the very existence of that ttate and harm her in proportion to the extent cf the defect 2. If the modern history of Iraq is carefully examined it will appear that the young Iraqi state was only founded after the last Great war, i.e the war of 1914—1918. Iraq at once commenced to consoli date gradually her three foundations, beginning with entiusting the sovereignty of the nation into the hands of the late King Faisal. I, the founder of modern Iraq and restorer of her ancient glory. Then followed the enactment of her organic law, the raising of her r rmed forces, the delimitation of her frontiers, the conclusion of the Treaty of Alliance between Iraq and Great r . Britain whose interests coincided with the independence of Iraq, and finally her admission to the League of Nations and adherence to the covenant thereof.For her existence and stability during that period, Iraq was only indebted next to God, to the efforts of her sincere sons, to the Great House of Hashim and to the British Government who deemed it to be in her own interest to support the wishes of the people of Iraq. As a matter of fact not one of all the great and small countries of the world, including those who call themselves now the Axis Powers, agreed to recognize the independence of Iraq except only through the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty which was approved and welcomed by all Arab Countries. Even the leading personalities of E&gt;jypt, foremost among them the Egyptian Wafd Party, were unanimous in recommending the conclusion of a treaty of alliance by Egypt with Great Britain on the same lines 3. It is exremely regrettable that, soon after the 'Iraqi State had been founded and stabilized, fate should make her suffer the tragic loss of her great leader and founder King Faisal the First, just at the beginning of her new life. Eventually, she had to face many difficulties and was threatened with innumerable clangers, whereby elements of weakness crept into her constitution. As soon as the policy of aggression began to assert itself a few years ago by the acts of certain ambitious states, the representatives of some of those powers were allowed to seize every opportunity for aggravating that state of weakness in 'Iraq by getting into touch with certain evil elements in the country such as selfish and adventurous persons and encouraging their dangerous activities. The result was that the wicked intentions of those powers towards 'Iraq, in particular, and the Arab Countries, in general, were proved beyond all doubt in spite of their pretended sympathy for the Arab cause as expressed through their proteges, mouthpieces and sycophants In this way those powers were able to take advantage of certain we &lt;knesses in 'Iraq, to encourage the agents of destruction and to widen the sphere of their action, thus striking heavy blows against the very basis of the three foundations upon which she rests. If, in fact, the agents, who have placed themselves at the disposal of those foreign powers who are eager to devour their country, were asked to state what made them^erve those powers, they would be unable to justify their shameful conduct which most dangerously threatened the very existence and vital interests cf their country. 4. Even before the present war certain aggressive powers began to carry out their abominable policy by resorting to force and invaded some countries with their armed forces. The extent of their aggression steadily increased and finally led to a declaration of war between the Axis Powers, on the one side, and Great Britain and her Allies, on the other. The war has since so spread that it has attained its present degree of magnitude. The right policy that should have been adopted by all states,— particularly those that are small and recently created—was to denounce and resist any aggressive policy pursued by any bullying power. Had all the states of the world combined, before the outbreak of the present war, and agreed that each one would join in opposing any armed aggression even if the state attacked was a distant one maconnectfed with them by special ties or interests, we should not have recently witnessed one state after another losing their independence and becoming victims of aggression, with all the sufferings and evils4 entailed thereby, Events have proved that to be indifferent to aggression is to encourage it and to allow it to expand and spread until in time it attains its climax. The Axis Powers who did so much harm to 'Iraq by encou raging and nourishing the elements of weakness therein have gradually put into execution their aggressive plans and have succeeded in widening the scope of their plans so that a large number of countries, such as Czechoslovakia, Poland. Yugoslavia, Greece, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Siam and even some parts of China, Russia and the possessions of the United States are now groaning under the oppressive yoke of Axis occupation. There is clear evidence of the threat of an early extension of armed aggression to other States and countries at tlie first opportunity, and among those threatened are the 'Iraq state and other Arab countries where the Axis Powers have indul ged in secret intrigue and open propaganda for some years past. Undoubtedly most of the loyal leaders in those countries now regret their failure to resist the policy of aggression in its initial stages and realise the folly of their once cherished belief that they could save their countries from aggression by being indifferent to the aggres sive acts which, as onlookers, they saw being committed in detail against other states. Had all the victims adopted at the outset the wise policy of promptly opposing each act of aggressioa as it occurred, each country contributing to the full extent of her capacity, the outlook of the present world war would have now been quite a different one, and perhaps, the leaders in and promoters of this aggressive policy would not even have ventured to carry it into final effect 5. The policy of armed aggression met with great success at the beginning of the war and brought destruction to all the countries which t he powers of evil were able to enter. In 1940 the Axis victories attained their zenith materially and threatened the whole world with the evils of subjugation and destruction. The policy of treachery and destruction adopted by the Axis Powers caused a shock of terror and anxiety unprecedented in the annals of history. The world then turned towards heaven searching for a ray of hope to enlighten the dark future. During those hard times and before the United States entered the war. Mr, Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, and Mr. Franklin D. Roosevelt met and announced on the 14th of August 1941, the ' Atlantic Charter' by which they expressed the common principles underlining the policy of their respective countries for the guarantee of a happy future when peace cooperation and confidence would replace doubt, suspicion and rivalry' amongst the peoples of the world. The Charter consists of eight articles, of which the second and third ones specially concern us. They read : Second : They desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned. Third : Thev respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of Government • under which they will live, and they wish to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them.These two articles enlighten the path along which the Arab Cause is advancing. They contain the cures for its complications and sound principles for the solution of its problems, as well as the means for the attainment of its ideals. Undoubtedly, these principles will continue to prevail as the American people has unanimously decided to take part in world affairs under Mr. Roosevelt's leadership for the benefit of the American people itself, as well as for the whole world. The most important factor in shattering the belief of men in international justice and shaking the spirit of mutual confidence among nations after the last world war was undoubtedly the withdrawal of the Government of the United States of America from participation in the field of European Politics and their refusul to support the ideals which they had themselves promulgated and promised to ensure. This negative attitude of the American Government gave a free hand to the other victorious states, who were bound to one another by pledges from which it was not easy for them to disengage themselves. This led to a number of difficulties and serious consequences of which unfortunately some of the Arab Countries had a share. Ihe return of the United States of America to the policy of participation in world politics will help to remove manv of the difficulties that may arise from previous international pledges, especially any secret ones and will ensure international justice according to the provisions of the Atlantic Charter. It is most unlikely that the Government of the United States of America will abstain from associating herself with general international affairs at the end of the present war, for they have already witnessed with their own eyes the misfortunes and calamities which befell the world as a result of their non-interference in world affairs after the last war, as well as the horrors and sufferings of the present struggle which surpass anything that occurred during any previous war. 6. After the aggravation of the Axis aggression and the entry of the United States of America in the war. the leaders of twenty-six states representing the inhabitants of more than two-thirds of the whole civilized world met and signed in Washington the Twenty-Six Powers Pact (Commonly known as the Declaration of the United Nations) which confirms the principles embodied in the Atlantic Charter and which aims at defeating the policy of aggression. In this declaration they have left the door open for all other nations who may or will help or contribute materially in the common struggle to join wifh them. 7. It is evident that it is in the vital interests of Iraq (being a state bound by the Anglo - Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, as well as by the Covenant of the league of Nations, and one who carries out her in ternational obligations with all candour and sincerity) to support any Policy which tends to ensure the freedom of peoples and resist aggress ion, especially when it is realized that in the fore-front of the states which back this policy stands the country which has already proved by her actions, her friendly attitude to Iraq and shown that her interests do accord with Iraq's independence. On the other hand, the end of the states who follow the policy of aggression in this respect has always been to obliterate the political existence of Iraq and encourage every movement started by Iraq's enemies in and out of this country.6 It was the duty of Iraq to stand by the side of her Ally Great Brit »in and her Allies ever since the declaration of this war. But she was unable to do so as she was engaged in fighting Axis mtngues m her own country. the most obvious proof of the wicked intentions of those powers towards Iraq is what they have don^ and are still doing m spreading false rumours about this country and intriguing against her, and by the continuous attacks directed by their broadcasting noble House of Hashim and by abusing every person who may be /egj.t- mately in power in Iraq. By all this they hope to persuade ^ 0 ^ avow her legal pledges contained in the Anglo - Iraqi Treaty of Alh. The Axis Powers act in this way when they themselves only recognized - our existence and independence through and as a result o this Treaty of Alliance. The wicked intentions of the Axis were most evident duiing the disgraceful rebellion of May, 1941 which they not only organized and financed but also supported openly and actively^ Moreover the Axis Powers did their utmost to provide arms and funds to the leaders of that rebellion in order to encourage it and aggravate the damage it had already done which indeed almost destroyed the country and imperilled its very existence. Axis officials levealed only too clearly the real interest of their Governments in the affairs of Iraq when they arrived m ^ h dl ;- ring that notorious rebellion. The first thraK they d,d » as . to 1 ° 0 \^ t ; ever produce or Roods they could lay then hands on, and they sent Urge quantities to their countries. The Axis Po wers are not content with the loss and damage they have occasioned to life and property in Iraq. They are now harbouring a number of the leaders of that rebellion and their lo ^ rs from justice. These treacherous persons are being forced by the Axis to engage in propaganda against Iraq in order to obtain the vevy means subsistence. All these activities are positively hostile in character. All the evidence indicates that such acts are only a cloak covering pteparaUon» for armed hostile action which the Axis will not hesitate to direct against Iraq whenever an opportunity occurs. What the Axis have done to Iraq they also did and are still do ing to all Arab countries whom they aim at enslaving as everybody well knows. 8 It is obvious from the above that the Axis Powers have been aiming at the destruction of Iraq as a state, and that for years thev have exerted unceasing efforts to achieve this. Ever since the outbreak of war they have been openly hostile in their attitude towards this country and have actually most dangerously threatened its existence. Had it not been for the mercy of God, Iraq would have now been subjected to all the ooting, persecution and bondage which are being endured by the coun tries who have passed under the Axis yoke.7 The majority of the Chamber of Deputies expressed their desire that Iraq should adhere to the principles of the Atlantic Charter (vide President of the Chamber's letter No. 69. dated 12th November, 1942) The adherence of Iraq to the Declaration of the United Nations will enable her to stand formally side by side with the United Nations who are struggling for the principles of freedom and justice. Moreover, such adherence will greatly assist Iraq to attain her national objectives and realise her ideals in her internal, as well as external policies. These policies have been announced on several occasions and have in view the welfare of Iraq and that of the Arab countries which are struggling to obtain their freedom and independence. Moreover, the liabilities to be borne by this country as a result of the adherence to the above Declaration are, under no circumstances, expected to be other than thos e to which she has pledged herself under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty and th e Covenant of the League of Nations.OFFICIAL STATEMENT. In vie of the hostile attkude which has been adopted for a long time by the Axis Powers against Iraq and of the continued activities through their agents for the destruction of the legitimate Iraqi Government and of the pressure brought to bear on the Iraq Parliament (as revealed in the Parliamentary Resolution adopted by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate on 11th November, 1941, and 15th November, 1941, respectively) and in view of the openly hostile action taken by them during May, 1941. And in view of the persistence of the Axis Powers in their hostile attitude from then to the present time by the attacks directed against Iraq and her interests through their Broadcasting Stations; and in view of their continued efforts to create differences and dissensions between the var ious communities of Iraq, with the object of endangering public secu rity and public order by spreading false rumours and lying news through their Broadcasting Stations as well as by all other means available to them. And in view of the fact that the Broadcasting authorities of the Axis Powers openly and unceasingly use abusive expressions which are intended to impair the dignity of the Royal Family and so undermine the loyalty of the Iraqi people; and also in view of the fact that the Axis Po wers encouraged those persons who defied the law and attempted to over throw the Constitutional System of their country by force of arms and have, after the escape of these persons from Iraq, harboured and main tained them. In view of what is stated above and pursuant to Article 26 (8) of the organic Law, His Highness the Regent has issued Royal Irada (Decree) No. 29 dated 13th January, 1943 , declaring a state of war be tween Iraq and the Axis Powers as from midnight of 16-17 January,1943.PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BY THIRTY-TWO DEPUTIES AT THE MEETING HELD BY THE CHAMBER OF DEPUTIES ON 12TH NOVEMBER, 1942.

While the Chamber appreciates the sacrifices and efforts made by Your Highness in saving Iraq from a disaster brought upon her by a handful of persons actuated by personal greed and instigated by foreign intrigue, it is fully confident that justice will be meted out to the promoters of that insurrection so that the conscience of the nation may rest at peace and the repetition of such deplorable incidents be prevented in future . We request the Government to adopt all the proposals put forward in the Speech from the Throne as we consider that they constitute a ser vice to the country and are in the interests of the nation, now endea vouring to save itself from the calamaties and disasters which are at present crushing the world , and so fulfil the pledges made to her allies in the spirit as well as in the letter of the Treaties.

The House, likewise, realising the developments in world eonditions welcomes the decision of the Government to carry out those essential works required for organising the economic life of the country and ensuring the welfare and prosperity of the people. The House beseeches the Almighty to protect our beloved King Faisal, II, and to preserve Your Highness and to vouchsafe to the people of Iraq the progress and advancement which they are eager to attain.

F irst , their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or nther. S econd , tkey desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned. T hird , they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and they wish to see sovereign rights and self-government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of them. F ourth , they will endeavour, with due respect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all States, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access on equal terms to trade and to the raw mate rials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity. F ifth , they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing for all improved labour standards, economic advancement and social security. S ixth , after the final destruction of Nazi tyranny, they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all nations the means of dwell ing in safety within their own boundaries and which will afford assur ance that all men in all lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want. S eventh , such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceans without hindrance. E ighth , they believe that all nations of the world for realistic as well as spiritual reasons must come to the abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments continue to be employed by nations which threaten or may threaten aggression outside their frontiers, they believe, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that disarmament of such nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measures which will lighten for peace- loving peoples the crushing burden of armament.NO. 27/12/43.

Office.x___/ ^ I 1 ? / K f * \ ■ A •Y; CC-M'...r- No. 111. British Embas^, Bagdad (27/12/43) 28th March, 1543. Sir, ' p - In ngr despatch No# 2irof January 22nd, I reported Iraq 1 s formal declaration of war on the Axis Powers and her adiiesion to the Declaration of the United Nations made at V /ashington on January 2nd, 1942. This action seems to have caused noticeable heartburning to neighbouring governments. Egypt, Syria, Persia and Saudi-Arabia all hurriedly took stock of their respective positions in relation to this event and, though their reactions varied with their individual circumstances, all apparently felt that Iraq had cleverly stolen a march on them, I doim leJls Sauoi .. . g f 1 2. In Iraq-itself the first tangible fruits of the declaration were a conditional offer of a small armed force to help Great Britain and a praiseworthy effort to give more effective cooperation in providing grain supplies for other countries in the Middle Kast# On February 8th the Prime Minister called on. me to offer to send a force of a maximum strength of one .aixed brigade to Turkey, if the war should come there, and to detail a second brigade for duty as garrison troops in Palestine or Syria. As I reported at the time, I don , t believe that service abroad would be well received by either the Iraqi Amy or the public and the political objections to the 'sending Of Iraqi troops to Palestine or Syria are g grave and obvious. I accordingly welcomed your instructions to tell the prime Minister that though His Majesty! s , Government we^e grateful for this offer,' they had come to the conclusion that the best help that the Iraqi Amy could give was to Continue to cooperate in the protection of military coiiinunicatiOns in their own country. Nuri Pasha took this decision in good part, though he maintained, as was only to be expected, that I was at fault in thinking that service outside Iraq, would be unpopular•« ' J* rO -'j'- o'V/.;O'po.-.y :r' 4 -v.-. ;? f . &gt;r : , r 3, Although Nuri Pasha would not commit himself publicly at the time of Iraq* s declaration of war' to help neighbouring countries in Respect of' cereals, I made full use of the nev, situation in pressing home bo tlx on him aoid the Minister of Finance &amp;at it was the duty of the Iraqi Government now that they were belligerents to take energetic and determined action in order to prdvide the barley so sorely needed in Persia end Turkey. After Constant representations : l a Notification was eventually imblished 6n January 13th - fixing prices and establishing Government control ovej;- all P sales of barley. The Notification was the (kDvemmeht 1 s ^ first important endeavour to cooperate more fully on the economic front and represented a major step towards proper control of cereals and stabilisation of cereal prices. The main points were : - 4 . . (a) ■ 1 -•■'0»; ',! * t. : j *. .&gt; 4 i , f The Right Honourfible . Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., Etc.a Etc. n(a) In the liwas of Bagdad, Hillah, Diwaniyah, Muntafiq, Kut, Diyala, Aniara and Dulaiin the Government required all persons to surrender any stocks of 'barley which they held in excess of their own requirements for food. (h) The prices fixed v/ere ID 19 a ton for grain declared up to February 28th; ID 17 a ton for later declaration up to March 15th and ID 15 a, ton for stocks registered from March 15th to M&amp;rch 31st. Unregistered harley found after March 31st to he confiscated with a nominal payment not to exceed ID 10 a ton. Even after the Cabinet had agreed to the measures vhich it embodies for the control of barley, the publication of the Notification was unexpectedly held up at the last moment owing to the annoyance caused to the Minister of Finance by some remarks made by the Prime Minister during a debate in the Senate on the Governments economic policy. The Prime Minister admitted that the Government * s action had so far been inadequate and unsuccessful but promised better planned measures in the near future. Salih Jabr felt that these remarks implied a criticism of his own work as Minister of Finance and left the meeting determined to resign. So ^oon as I learnt of this contretemps I saw both Ministers separately and spoke to each of the folly of breaking up the Cabinet at this Juncture. The Prime Minister protested that his admission was unavoidable and that he had intended no critidism of Salih Jabr's work. But Salih Jabr was aggrieved and upset and aisposed to entertain the worst suspicions. I was able nevertheless to persuade them to meet each other and eventually a reconciliation v/as effected. This was the last and most threatening of the many hitches which had impeded the desired action and the Notification was thereafter signed by Salih Jabr a?id brought into operation. Up to the ( present nearly 50^000 tons of barley have been registered and of this quantity the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation have already purchased about 25,000 tons for export. While the amount the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation are likely to obtain from the total quantity now available will enable deliveries to be made to Turkey and Persia on a fairly satisfactory scale for about two months, the deficiencies in those two countries, especially the second, are so great that it is essential that the Iraqi Government should embark on more forceful and effective action to unearth further substantial quantities of barley known to exist in Iraq. I shall continue to exert all possible pressure to secure such action and have arranged for the Political Advisory staff to cooperate with and spur on the local administration in their efforts to locate and obtain possession of more barley. ' ■ Vv.4, Of less iHsaodi&amp;te iniport^ce but of considerable potuntial conseeu^nce is the new 'Lm far the Ee^ulation of the . .cononiic life of the Country' 1 nor before Parlisiaent. This supersets the original law enacted in 1942 and places the direction of econoirdc policy and. supplies in the hands of a Cabinet Cossaaittee of three members with the Prime Minister as Chairman. It vdll also perrrdt the transfer of the control of grains and most local produce from Finance to Interior where a new department, largely under the influence of the British Advisers, will be set up# fhis new legislation will certainly cause a considerable, and possibly angary, flutter in the Parliamentary dovecotes, and X shall be pleasantly surprised if it escapes serious imitilation at the hands of reactionary believers in the out-worn theories of n laissez-faire'• Transport has already been placed uinder the executive control of Colonel Le Blanc, an energetic officer of wide experience • I welcome this appointment for two main reasons# Firstly, Colonel Le Blanc should be invaluable in bringing about saxch-needed organisation of Irabroad transport. Secondly, since this officer was selected for his present post by idle late Oonsaander—in—Chief, Persis/lra&lt;i Force, his presence vdll be a couifort to General Headquarters, who, prior to his arrival, were not unnaturally reluctant to release to the Iraqi authorities valuable material, such as tyres, etc., which, though consigned to this country on civilian account, they feared might be misused in one form or another. Iraqi irritation over delays in securing possession of such ecjuipiiient, and over the military use of same 40,. of available civil transport vehicles, threatened at one moment to give rise to political complications. I should perhaps add here . that the prime Minister and others have also displayed a certain sensitiveness over the extent of British military participation in the control and operation of the Iraqi State Railways, with the result that from time to time I feel obliged to use njy good offices, in consultation with the Conmiander-in-Chief, to prevent occasional' ruffled waters being seriously disturbed by angry squalls. If I mention these matters it is merely to illustrate the constant watchfulness that is necessary to ensure that minor difficulties do not deteriorate into major coin|)lexities. 6. a further development in the Government 1 s economic policy was the setting up, early in the new year, of a Coiaaittee 'to examine the question of making grants of certain con odities to deserving classes of the people'. The Committee's report which has recently come into spy hands, recommends the distribution at low prices of soap, vegetable oil, rice and cloth to officials, policemen snd all regular Crovemment employees. ^ Considerable quantities of soap have in fact already been distributed as well as '6,000 metres of cloth. Special plans are being studied for the distribution of essential commodities on a v ifier scale. Kotv ithstanding these / activities,activities, the Administration continue to be much criticised for the slowness with wiiich they are grasping the economic nettle, and for their continued subserviency to powerful agricultural and mercantile vested interests. The I act is that the Prime Minister v /ith his head lull of Fan-Arab dreams, is reluctant to offend any potential political 'friends^. 7, While I have been engaged in bringing the Iraqi Government to the point of making available part of the surplub produce of the country for export to needy, neighbours, the Prime Minister and the Minister of x inanoe iiave not ceased to press for more active help from His Majesty* s Government• Their most urgent demands , have concerned a gold backing for a national loan, to be raised to reduce the steadily increasing amount of currency in circulation, the release of more civil transport from British Army use, 'the reduction of the number of sheep consumed by our forces, the provision of lease-lend agricultural machinery and the supply to the Government, instead of to merchants, of piece-goods, soap matches, coffee and tea for controlled distribution, I have reported separately on all these questions and it is unnecessary for me to deal vdth them in detail here. It will suffice to record that the visit to Bagdad in early March of Sir Arthur Rucker and Er, Lloyd from the Minister of State's office in Cairo and the talks wiiich they had with Nuri Pasha and Salih Jabr encouraged the Iraqi Government to believe that we were doing our best for^them and in fact led to practical, help being given in several ways. There remain, however, several demands which have not yet been met and provided that the Iraqi Government continue to give their cooperation in plans to satisfy our urgent grain requirements it will in my opinion be well for us to deal v.ith these demands sympathetically. It must frankly be confessed that the popularity of the LlidcGLe East Supply Centre has lately waned in this country where it is hard for local politicians and others to appreciate the difficulty of persuading other countries to cooperate in easing Iraq's burdens unless it is clearly in their own interest. Moreover, Iraqi opinion cannot see why the Middle Bast Supply Centre should worry over such problems as the dhow traffic in the Persian Gulf, for there is naturally little sympathy for the theory that all available supplies should be equally distributed to ..addle Eastern territories. As, in fact, there is small hope of establishing effective control over the dhows, I have advised that to avoid unnecessary forfeiture of goodwill, the notion should be dropped. / Q.-5~ 8. A political feature of the first quarter of the current year has bean tha revival of Arab nationalist activity. Beginning with a negative reaction to eDullient Sionism,. it later developed into a positive endeavour to find a laeans of laying the foundations of /iTab unity. Towards the end Of January, Nuri Fash?-, addressed a-long memoranobjua- to the Minister of State at Cairo on' the subject of Arab national affairs. It began rlth a renewed-^ ; protest against current Zionist clkirns sjrtd propaganda., went on to review the history of Syria!, Palestine and Iraq since the last war, and concluded with a recornnend- ation that the United Rations should immediately declare the federation of Syria, the Lebanon, Palestine and Trans Jordan into one St&amp;te'aj^d promote the formation of an Arab Union to which this Greater %ri&amp; and Iraq- should adhere at once and 'other* join at will* The Priaie Minister printed and seht copies of this memoranduia to the Viceroy 6f India, the Dominions Prime .jlnisters and amuBbci* of ^ih^lish gantlfcifeen* c in public life who have in noue \v8y officially or unofficially bce&amp; associated -..ith ono or other of the Arab countries. The Prlm£ ICLnister also acquainted King Ibn': SaucL, throu^' the Saudi Arabian Legation in Bagdad,: and. the /vmlr Abdullah (by personal o letter) with tlio esscniial features of his proposals. Having'himself thus made an effort to direct- and stimulate interest in Arab federation, . Nuri Pasha naturalty warmly welcomed your statenieiit in the House of Coxamons reiterating the assur^co first, i^ven at the Mansion House irl %, that His Majesty's C-overnment would regard vi%.sy^'athy anjr niovoment among the Arabs to promote economic, cultural oi* political umty.^. . . remark that the initiative i^st dler^iy come frou the £rabs themselvesspurred him, noreovor, to X'tirther action and he arranged for Jamil IladfaA, 'a former Prime Minister and veteran of tiie Arab' hewemenf.,. to visit 3yria and Trans Jordan discreetly to consult political leaders ^and to seek agreement v.ith them on a comfaon policy. Before he left Bagdad, Jamil MadPai told me that he and his friends had been much encouraged by your statement -and felt that the Arab leaders should at once begin the serious study of the problejd of .Arab federation. : He assured me that I could re^.on Ms entire discretion. He knew that the realisation of ^rab hopes dejxjnded on the support of m.s Majesty* s (k)Vernment ajid-he vd.shed to avoid aV action likely to eiribarra$s;us* According to the information given to me oy Niori Pasha, Arab leaders in Palestine'' have' also been moved by your promise of British sympa.thy to consider how they can help to prodaice an agreed plan for the closer integration of the divided Arab countries and both they and the Amir- Abdullah of Trans Jordan appear to have b een thinking of gathering together a congress oP conference to discuss details, .lean^^hile Tahsin Askari, lli ister of the Interior, and Tahsin Ali, ^linister of Pducatxon, have been busy arranging for the opening in Bagdad of a branch of the ''rab Union Society (Nadi al Ittihad al Arabi) recently founded in Kgypt. The declared objects of / the/ v- the society include work for a closer cooperation between all Arab countries and the defence of the rights of the ^rab World. Experience has uade me suspicious of societies of this kind and I have reminded the Prime Minister of the harm done by the Muthanna Club and have urged that the branch or branches opened in Iraq, should be kept under the closest supervision* The Committee of the Society was elected a few days ago. The majority of the members are men of moderate views and the zealots of the Muthanna have been excluded. 10. Security continues everywhere to be good and pro-Axis propaganda is not at present a factor of importance in the political life of the country.^ The Prime Minister has discussed with me his desire to bring to trial in Iraq the surviving persons who were charged before the Military Court set up in January 1942 to deal with the organisers of the coup d'etat of April, 1941. I told His Excellency that before I could recommend His Majesty 1 s G-overnment to send these persons back to Iraq from Southern Rhodesia, I should need to be assured that all his colleagues agreed with his wish to have them tried. There is, I hear, a difference of opinion on this matter among members of the Cabinet and the Prime Minister seems to have dropped his proposal, at ar\y rate for the time being. 11. On Pebruazy 22nd, an official notification was published in the newspapers summoning all Iraqis living in eneny or eneny-occupied territory to return within two months to Iraq and threatening those who failed to do so with trial in absentia, by Court Martial. No exemptions^ were provided for persons who were detained against their wishes or unable to find the means of returning to their homes but the Minister for Poreigh Affairs informs me that the Governments purpose is only to prosecute well known renegades such as the Berlin broadcaster Tunis Bahri and a number of young officers and students who fled to Europe through Turkey after the collapse of Rashid Ali 1 s administration in 1941. 12. Apart from the declaration of war, little of importance has occurred in Iraq's foreign affairs since the beginning of the year, but there are two events which should perhaps be recorded. Monsieur Kadleq, who has recently been appointed Czechoslovak Minister at Tehran, spent several days in Bagdad early in March en route to his post. He approached the Iraqi Government with a view to obtaining their official recognition of the Czechoslovak Government and their agreement to his appointment as Minister here. It appears probable that both proposals will be accepted. Secnndly, in early March the Government regularised the position of the American and Polish Forces in Iraq by obtaining the consent of Parliament to a law- granting to all Allied forces which are duly constituted in Iraq the same judicial immunities and privileges as those already enjoyed by the British Forces.13, The excitements of nationalist politics and of turbulent economics have of late heavily eclipsed the affairs of the Ministry of Education which a short time ago occupied so much attention* Nevertheless, some progress has been made towards reform since the two discredited Directors—G-eneralj Dr. Sami Shaukat and Dr. Padhil Jamali, were relieved of their appointments. Other changes have also been made among the senior officials of the Ministry and the way has now 'been opened for a further advance in the desired direction. Whether it will be achieved is a moot question, as unhappily _ Sadek G-ohar, the new Egyptian expert at the Ministry of Education, is proving very difficult to v-drk with and is becoming extremely unpopular in Iraqi circles. It is regrettable, too, that Professor Hamley, whose health has of late been indifferent, appears determined to leave for the United Kingdom as soon as possible after the termination of his contract in April. IL. The winter now ended has, climatically-speaking, been very pleasant and (what is more important) endowed with a bountiful rainfall. The prospects for the coming harvest, provided we are spared unforeseen pests or disease, are excellent. Taken by and i^gf &gt; country, notwithstanding its economic difficulties, is remarkably blessed in comparison with its immediate neighbours, with many of its inhabitants considerable prosperity. All this was rexlected in the demeanour of the crowds who recently celebrated the birthday of the Prophet on a cool day ol brilliant spring sunshine. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty^ Representatives at Angora, Cairo, Tehran, Jedda and Beirut, the Minister of State at Cai^ 0 » Majesty • s High Commissioner for Palestine and Trans Jordan, the Governor-General of India, the Coinmander-in-Ghief India, General Headquarters, Middle East, the Combined Middle wst Intelligence Centre, the Political Resident xn the Ver*±axi Gulf, the Political Agent at Koweit and to His Majesty s Consular OfficErs at Basra dnd Mosul.

The Prl»e Minister* with £i ood reason* was disappointed with Saleh Jabr for his failure to fulfil the hopes placed in him when he went to the Ministry of Finance last October; aaleh jabr was irritated with the Priaae Minister for having obstructed a grant of several thousand acres of government land whicl he wished to make t© an old friend, he had qtprrelled with the Miniel er of Justice and had fallen out with the Minister of Education* wh&lt; was becoming inore^singly disliked by all his colleague® because of his ooarseneas; and 7a he in al jMsksri had proved a failure at the Ministry of the Interior* In addition* the Prions f inlster suspected Baud si Haideri of intriguing against him and had reason to believt that in the absence of a proper Head of the Royal Diwan* minor Court officials were abusing their position to influence tribal visitors to the Palace against the aovemment. 2# In these confused but typical elrcucistances, eorae c hen gee were essential and so soon as the Current session of iarliament ended* #uri Pasha set about reorganising his cabinet. His raethod was that which is usually ec^loyed at such tiuiea in thia country! much hard talking behind the scenes with colleagues and with candidates for office* combined with uiany consultations with the Regent. Hia accellency also came to see the Ambascaaor frequently to exchange views, as a result the following changes were nsode on June 23rd. Saleh Jab* was transferred to Interior and was succeed^ at Finance by Jalal Baban.

He ^aid that in the first place he had himself been primarily responsible for the adoption of a strong internment policy, and in the second that he was quite satisfied that none of the men released was at all likely to be dangerous. This second contention was largely borne out by examination of the list of those set free# Of the total of fifty-seven, thirty were found to be men of small account and twenty-two others had bead provisionally classified by the Goamittee as fit for release. Of the remaining five, however, three were undesirables #ith Qerman wives and one a thoroughly bad man named ^akl Kadhim, jm ex-non-commissioned officer of the Iraqi Army who, as Physical Training Instructor in the Teachers * Training College, had, in May 19l|l, earned notoriety as the organiser and leader of the so- called M Death Squad* of students pledged to fight to the end against the British. At my request the Minister of the Interior arranged for the men with the German wives to be warned to be careful of their conduct and ordered Zaki Kadhlm to live in the provinces under lose police supervision. All these people had bean sent to Internment from Bagdad*. The releases of internees from the provinces were dealt with more regularly. The Minister of the Interior was guided by the recommendations made by the Mutasarrlfs and, through the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, I was able to see the list of names before any releases were ordered* Of the original tlftyufour names t\xm ttlarister was persuaded to delete nine and of the forty-five who remained only one wae of any eonsequence.

The examination of these mm has not yet been finished, but from the data so far collected it seems that they intended to drop not to the west of Mosul but much further east, close to the Persian frontier and that they expected to find confederates ready to lielp them whan they landed# An unpleasant feature of this business is that about a week passed before these agents were apprehended. During that period they undoubtedly received help, including gifts of clothing and food, from friendly villagers and possibly other helpers. A further fact that has caused no small comment is that the flight of Jtoe l6th/17th was followed on succeeding nights by others, the enemy aircraft droning around at wiU on each occasion for some time over an extensive area. So far as I am aware, not even a rifle shot was directed at these hostile machines, ana this has not helped our local prestige. ?• Hurl Pasha had intended to take leave soon after the middle of ^Tune and to pay his long talked of visit to Egypt to discuss plans for Arab unity with Kahas Pasha. The sudden illness to which I have already referred prevented him from carrying out this plan arid obliged hLu to go to the Lebanon for his convalescence. He left Bagdad on July 6th. His health being now apparently restored he has gone down into BSgypt to fulfil his original intention, but it is not clear what proposals he will make to Kahas Pasha. At the beginning of the year he had hopes of persuading the Egyptian Prime Ojaister to call together a congress of Arab leaders to draw up a plan for some kind of federation of the Arab States, but it was later reported from Jedda that last April, he told the Saudi Arabian Minister that in his opinion an Arab Congress could not usefully be held until Syria and Palestine had feeen set free. It seems therefore that he may not yet have made up his mind whether Palestine and Syria must have their independence before anything can be done to bring the Arab countries closer together or whether it is possible to work mt a scheme for federation which would take in these countries as .they are. 8. , After long negotiations and much argument, the Iraqi Government offered at the end of June to fix the price of barley containing ten per cent dirt at 1920/500 per ton delivered at collecting centres, produce tax paid. This offer, which represented a reduction of II4/?DC or eighteen per cent on the price paid under the Iraqi Government 1 s fixed price scheme for the balance of the 1942-crop, was accepted by His Majesty^ Government. Owing to the Iraqi Government's natural and characteristic reluctance to commit themselves on paper to supply a definite quantity and a last minute change of ground regarding the method of payment for barley delivered to the United Kingdom CommercialuCorporation, it was not until July 23rd that notes were finally exchanged confirming the conditions on which the Iraqi Government undertook to ensure delivery of 200,000 tons of barley at the agreed price to the Concretion, liost people think that the price &lt;f ID20/500 is good enough to induce grower£s to sell their barley without aversion | in fact, there are'signs that many of them are anxious to offer all the bpley they have and not only t^e third at present requisitioned. The price cf barley on the farms has been fixed at ml5/000. The wheat price has also been fixed - at 1225/000 on the farms for best^0 :i.v : . ^ 4 - &gt; i s s best quality, this being 'the same price as last year, and at 1032/000 delivered at collecting centres, tax paid. 9.

Among the few tangible complaints Included in this surprising tirade was his claim that the Iraqi Government were eonscripting Saudi subjects into the Iraqi Army and forcing them to take up Iraqi nationality. The trouble seems to come from the fact that in Subair there are many people of Najdi origin. The Iraqi authorities claim that Kajdis are ex-Ottomans and therefore became Iraqis -under the nationality clauses of the Treaty of Lausanne, but the Samdi Government maintain that Kajdis were never Ottoman subjects and therefore did not become Iraqis but Saudi Arabians* The point is debataole^and King Abdul Azziz can no doubt produce arguments in # support Ox his government s thesis, but there is no justification for assuming that the Iraqis attitude is part of a carefully developed plot to destroy his position and prestige* I have asked ^ ji I pig mbest quality, this being the saia© price as lust year, and at IB32/000 delivered at collecting centres, tax paid, 9m The Istlhlak (consumption) tax on all natural produco was raised by one and a half per cent^ and 'super' tax increased substantially in laws passed Just before Parliament was dissolved on June 9tiu 10 • Many classes of imported goods became much cheaper after the publication iji May of the new Law for the Regulation of the Economic Life of the Country and the subsequent issue of decrees canalising and controlling - on paper - trade in imported goods♦ As. however,' the Governnxent shcv/ed a lack of determination in setting up machinery for enforcing the decrees, the phase of lower prices soon passed and prices for imported goods are now, with few exceptions, airiest back again at their old high level# Meat, fruit and vegetables are now dearer than, ever and a large proportion of the working classes cannot afford to buy thera.

On November 6th Iraqi troops and police made a reconnaissance in force from Mergasur northv/ards in the direction of the Greater ^ab River, the Head of the British Military Mission and the iraqi Deputy Chief of the General Staff being present with the troops. They soon met with spirited opposition and lost a number of men killed ard wounded before abdndoning the reconniassance and returning to their base# Two days later a similar and equally ineffective operation'was carried out and on November 10th a convoy moving from Howanduz to Mergasur was attacked by tribesmen and extricated with some difficulty from an uncomfortable situation. In these operations the Iraqi troops and police claim to have inflicted casualties on the tribesmen, but they themselves have shown a lementable lack of training in mountain warfare. They have also lost three or four light automatics and many more rifles to the tribesmen. At the time of writing it seems doubtful whether there will be time before the onset of winter to attempt any further operations other than restricted patrolling., 12. S new . .utasarrif. Wafiq Habib, has been appointed to Sulaimani and Shaikh mud* s son, Bab a All, has been allowed to return to his home. The internment order passed against Latif (Baba Ali's younger brother) has also bfeen cancelled and there is hope that he may be persuaded to return from Sardasht where he has been adding to the confusion already existing among the Kurdish tribes on the Persian border. * 13» The Yezidi chieftains, Khalaf al Nasir and Khodaida Hamo Sharo were detained in Mosul in early September and later sent to live in Halabja in the Sulaimani Liwa. They had been giving trouble to the local authorities in the Sinjar'and it was considered that a short spell of enforced residence outside their own tribal area would make them more amenable. 14. Monsieur Msky arrived in Bagdad by the ova?land route in the early morning on October 6th and left the following morning by car en route for Tehran. During his short stay he had an interview with Nuri Pasha who told me that Monsieur Maisky was obviously eager that diplomatic relations between Moscow and Bagdad should be established as soon as possible. He was, however, determined that the first official step towards this end should be taten by the Iraqi Government. Nuri Pas ha 1 agreed in principle to an exchange of diplomatic representatives but pleading the Cabinet difficulties and his own imminent departure on leave under doctor^ orders, deferred further action to a later date. The Prime IVIinister explained to me that it was his intention to await the outcome of the thbn forthcoming Moscow Conference and of the subsequent conference which he thought would take place between Mr. Churchill, President Roosevelt and Marshal Stalin. 15. The establishment of a Russian Legation in Bagdad would withouj doubt excite much interest and speculation not only in the capital itself but throughout Iraq. Russian military successes have won as much popular admiration here as they have elsewhere among the peoples of the United Nations and the social and industrial achievements of the Soviet Government, though only dimly understood have attracted wide attention. There is, moreover, in this country an old established tradition of foreign interference and among many of its people an inherited instinct for intrigue withwith foreign influences which will give to thehad vent of a Soviet diplomatic mission a special significance and importance. It is to. be expected that many of the young men of the 'left wing* 5 will hasten to establish personal contact with the nembers of the Soviet mission and that with customary Oriental hyperbole they will pour out their enthusiasm in adulation and flattery. Iha habitual intriguers too will be well up in the rtoriing. and will eagerly seek to entanglo the Legation in thalrV plots .and schemes. The n^our-mongors' and political prophets will,also find in the arcana of Soviet foreigx; policy a rich field for the cultivation of tlieir peculiar ideals, and with the opening of diploma tic relations between Iraq and Russia there OTS.t cbine a flood of talk about what this event portends for Iraq. 16* Mr* Wilson, the tinister Resident of the United States of America, left'Bagdad on September 18th and his successor is expected to arrive with the rank of sinister Plenipotentiary before the end of November. 17# The Iraqi minister , at Washington ?/as authorised in later October to sign, on behalf of, the Iraqi Govemaent, the United ITations belief Rehabilitation Agreement. 18.

Gratifying evidence of the jroodwill of the people of this country towards Great Britain continues to come in from many quarters. Throughout September' parties, official, semi-official and private, were given all over the country to celebrate the Allied victory over Italy and I myself received nearly two hundred congratulatory telegrams. One shaikh of Amara expressed his pleasure in the event by purchasing £10,000 War Savings bonds and renouncing interest and many others have bought smaller quantities of bonds on similar terms. In the provinces Shaikhs and notables called in hundreds on the Political Advisory Officers to tell them how delighted they were by the great success won by the Allied armies in th^ Mediterranean. In everyday life, too, practical cooperation is constantly beinr. shorn as my be seen fro the following examples. On September 11th the Assistant Provost Ilarshal 2nd Indian Division reported of Bagdad that 'there was noticeclie improvenent in the relations between the civil police and the British military police 11 and of Musaiyib that 'the civil police were very obliging and always willing to assist'. FromFrom Kirkuk# too, the report on the Iraqi police was that on all occasions requests for help had been met with courtesy and alacrity* On the morning of the 'Icl al Fitr the Iraqi Army officers gave £ party at their G'lub in Bagdad to Muslim - officerG of the Indian Army and in the afternoon the Indian officers entertained the Iraqi officers. The fund vihich I and my wife recently opened to provide Qhri^^3 presents for the British sailors, soldiers and airsuen serving in this country provided another opportunity to many to show their goodwill and contributions have been received from all classes of the people and every part of the country. 22* I have refrained from consenting in this despatch upon the economic problems of the hour, feeling thafc for the moment the general ' mise~en-scene M will have been sufficiently depicted in my 'despatch Ho# 397 of November 6th now on its way to you, 3ir, by fast bag. 23* I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty's representatives at Cairo, Angora, Tehran, Jedfis and Beirut, the Minister of States Resident in tne Middle gast, His Majesty's High Commissioner for Palestine and Trans jo ixlan, the Gove nor-Gene al of Indies, General Headquarters India, General Headquarters Middle Kast, the Political Intelligence Centre, Middle iast, the Political pesident in the Persian Gulf, the Political Agent at Ko we it and to His Majesty's Consular Officers at Basra and Mosul# I have the honour to be with the highest respect.

The combating of any tyranny established, or to be establlahed, by the axis powers, the wiping out of any (reaialiiing; influences of such tyranny in Iraq and the continued exercis&lt; of caution, even after peace, against such powers or their agents in order to prevent their penetration into Iraq to disturb its peace or corrupt the spirit and \ morale oi its people. 3. he rab vllianci policy la not held by Iraq merely as a (plank of) forei^a policy but m the ver. essence ot cottmioa action tax ^rabs • a special policy above ull eon si dfc rations with diatincUvt, feu turc^ oi i ts own.

(n the contrary this conception of the Arab alliance should serve to promote solidarity and cooperation among the inhabitants of Iraq and make for equality in rights among th^m and equal enjoyment of all the benefits conferred by -%?■ the Constitution, without preferential treatment of any form for any vac or in Ivlmial, Acting on such principles Iraq 11 assume a position of distinction such as will effectively help ensuring formation of the ^rab alliance and the cWfence of the rights of the ;.rabs f k* Dofaestic ecu:lnistration is somewhat troubled (or.gives cause for some anxiety;♦ The unaeri^in^ causes must be facea **nd corrective action should be taken, H' form houlu be uiiaertaken of government departments in general &amp;na the courts, the police and r . the aru.y in particular. attain this object practical and expeditious means must be found for the training of youn men with high school education to fit them for work. When thoy have been trained such you a men woulc be given responsibilities according to the vxpuri nco they hac: gone through. To maka available suoh ^ laments' and equip ana train them quickly is indeed the first necessary step to be taken to enable the &amp;tate purge the adminis tration ana remove from it those who have bean responsible for its deterioration. The following steps might be taken (? to th end): (a) jq repeal the Cadx^e ^aw, and to substitute for it a law giving the oouncil of i in is ter s and (individual) kini stars, powers^ to be laid down by Regulation, to draw up and ssnotion permanent an teiuporar^ cadres, to determine the manner on which cadres shall from time to time be reviseu ma the lines 4m which cadres are to' bu drawn up — subject to the total coat ox* the cacirea established not ..^vvc -.. im% t»it fMMta providea for the purpose in th e budget. -This arrangement to bt adopted for a period of five years coring which the State must prepare another and more suitable and whole some law, to be brought into application at the expiry of th© 3%Sr, A i«r — year period. Under euch mrrsaigcmentf the annual budgfci shall not be accompanied, during this 3 year period, by schedules of appoint ments and cadre statements, but will only show the total cost alluded to above# (b) to repeal the Civil Berrice Law and give powers, by means of a law, for the issut of regulations to deal with civil service affairs, Such law to be in force also for a period of 3 years, in the course of which mother wore auitable anq w&amp;oles&amp;Qie law should be drawti up, in the light of the axperltmce gained, to be put into application on the expiry of the p year pcj^Jlod, It would be well to point out that (? under such new law} salaries should be dfctemined having regard to t he appointment and the degree of r esponsibility it involves and an individual occupying an appointment shall receive the salary of that appointment. This should not, however, preclude determining minimum salary rates on which to appoint school graduate! for the first time. Periods should also be fixed after serving which an official should be definitely promoted, unless he shall have failed to prove that he has qualified himself for m appointment of a higher grade. Where en official is selected to occupy an appointment of a higher grade than that actually held by him such official shall retain his original salary for pension purposes, receiving that xxtsg*# original salary and paying pension contribu tions on Its basis, and shall be paid, as wages, the difference betwe«3n his original salary and that of the higher appointment he is selected to occupy until he shall have attained the grade of the iappolnUiUit actually occupies him. t&gt;o lon^ &amp;*&gt; an official proves himself efficient in the course of holding an appointment of a higher &amp;rade than his original appointment, he shall be deemed as having been legally promoted every third year, without specific office order of promotion, until he shall have attained the grade of the appointment actually occupied by him. Where an official is returned to an appointment with a salary less than that of his original grade, he shall thereupon be deemed to have had his grade reduced, and from tiat date shall begin the period the official is required to serve for the purpose of obtaining promotion from thatgrade, Through such process the state will retain in its service efficient officials for a long period, because officials will gain their jwansion© slowly, a circumstance which will induce theru to continue in service in order to obtain comfortable pensions which are only obtainable through long service* Besides, officials will not lose considerable sums in pension contributions over a consider able number ox /ears. In as uiach as en official will hold a higtor appointment on condi tlonf such as these ana his continued holain^ of such appointment will be dependant on his good services and the energy shown by him, he will ribt hesitate to serve with devotion lest he should revert to his original salary. Such conditions of service will instil the spirit of energy and assiduoi&gt;sness in all state officials* On the other hsnd there is liability to reduction of grade where the official fails to shown diligence and efficiency in hits work. Theae meaaurfca will have s/ great Affect on^morale of officials anc will prove an incentttive to diligence and aelf-exertion in aervice. The acivantages underlying these measures, added to the powers to sanstion extensive cadres, will enable the State to secure/consider- I able number of youngiaen for training and within a short space of time to discover qualified officials wherewith to meet the needs of the adminiatration and to help purge the latter of aged and corrupt ofiicieils. I (c) Bepeal of t he Officials liisclplinary utw and the granting to tie Government power to issue for disciplinary purposes regulations designed to ensure full control of its officials by the State and ^ also ft ensure Justice in the consideration of cases concerning State officials. (d) Subject to the principles adopted in Western States in regard to Judges and qadhis and their ir^unities, it is necessary to revise the Judges and t^adhia Law on mitable lines and'such extent as to remove the effects of the ,, tyranny ,, likely to characterise the conduct of judges as a result of their interpretation of their ii j t unities in a tnaantij incompatible with public interest.(e) In regard to the Army aa i oXioe 9 It Is ineyi tably necessary to remedy the state of affairs which has caused the grave decline of efficiency and encourage the sense of irresponslbiilty in the personnel of these two Important or^aj^issatlons. it is esaeritial to recruit foreign experts and entrust them with uirect responsi bilities with the object of making these two forces comparable with similur forces in western countries and Removed from politics, 5, It is not reasonable that the Police or the/f Army should receive in the matter of pensions any preferential treatment over civil servants, except# however, for the matter of the period of Qualification for pension which In the case of these two services is fixed at 23 years m against 30 years in the case of civil servants, A|&gt;art from this, it la right to cancel those provisions introduced into the pension laws for extravagant expenditure of public funds and for demoralisation of the character of the members of these two forces, This should notf however, preclude the grant of pensions on a liberal scale to dependants entitled to pension on account of the death of members of these forces dying in the course of active defence of the atate in the course of war or in the course of punitive operations undertaken for the suppression of domestic ttprisin^s, or in the course of exercises, 6, For the purpose of stopping party activities in the Iraq Army and having regard to the bitter experiences through which Iraq has gone, it would be a sound measure to bring the Army, properly and legally, under the otnmander-in-Chief, that is to say the King, Si^ch measure will put an end to all sort of partlsonship in the Amy, 7, The stopping of the policy of distributing land to influential persons on various pretexts and instead its distribution to the real cultivators and farmers themselves in reasonable lots. Provided that no persons shall be permitted to hide under the name of a farmer or planter and that no large estates shall be given to persons under assumed names. So much for real •mirl 1 land. But as for the installation of pumps since this requires large capitalthe matter should ba studied by an ca^ittets to Xt^ oom &amp; sound basis anew which shall naturally protect the rights ot the fallah In a proper and effective; manner, . 8. The evolution of a proper financial policy to proflt Sj# the properties of the State and the working out of economic and Industrial schemes together with the acceptance of the principle of their proper protection. Furthermore the undertaking of schemea for transport inside and outside the towns and the carrying m of all these schemes by the Oovernraent provided that they shall be transferred gradually to f he people so soon as they have become successful. -ills could be done by mem s of the creation of limited companies. In this manner the St^te will set up the organnecessary for Iraq, and these organ? will be transferred to the share holders of limited coaotpanies to whom the State would gradually sell i he shares* This would not prevent soiae of these projects from being undertaken Jointly by the state and the people if people can be found fit and able to cooperate with the State in \such schemes.11. 9» As the recent developments which have taken place in tjie world have created special difficulties in regard to supplies and the feeding of the public, and as it is clear that it is not possible for any government to reiaain without a special and important organization to deal with these mtters after the war, it is evident that it is necessary to create two Ministries, the first for agricultural and natural produce and for manufactures and the second for the control of supplies and for the organization of the feeding of the public, under which heads should be included the balancing of imports and exports. It -ust be stipulated that these inistries should be established on the basis that the State should derive revenue from those commodities which are of the least importance and recesity for food and on the principle that such revenue should be expended to reduce the cost of the /m njjuUoL commoditiea^for the poorer classes of the population and for their daily living so that it may be possible to provide them with those things which they need at prices within their aeans, even if on that account the Oovernaent should be involved in loss. Part of the revenue derived in the manner mentioned above could be devoted to the schemes mentioned in paragraph 8 for the development of production and its better organization. 10# The completion of irrigation schemes in accordance with a fixed programme to cover a period of ten years, priority being 1?: ven on he basis of real need and not political expediency. It is this of which the country is in great need and with the execution of such a programme it would be necessary to study the means for finding the labour required to exploit them. For without the necessary labour the carrying-out of. irrigation schemes of any magnitude woul ' be profitless. oreover slx.ce the matter of finding the necessary labour brings into consideration the possibility of seeking it outside the frontiers of Ctaq, it must be noted that recourse to such methods would not be contrary to Iraqi interests since the Arab people are one nation. Furthermore it would be of the utmost importance to obtain the requisite mechanical appliances for such schemes after the war.1t» Action is required to educate the new generation but in smeh a way that their religion is strengthened and their respect for their faith developed through the fear of God. If this is done they will be of benefit for there can be no life for a nation whoso intelligentsia are divorced frcni the religion of that nation. It is the duty therefore of oiir national education to rnxt this consideration I before all others in the organization of their cttrriculiim in the future. After this the..next task should be to distribute primary| elementary and secondary education into three courses differinr :fr the manner in which these- courses are at present divided. The fi rst course &gt; • This should be so expanded at present as to make It possible for it to befcone in the future a comjmlsory course for every Iraqi child and it should be concerned with the teaching of reading, Titing and arithmetic. The second course . This should aim at the Completion of the first course in subjects required by every individual who desires to ^ enter in any way Into social life, The course would end at the second class elementary or at the most at/the third. This vrntM mean that this cotirse would take one or two years from the primary course and two or three years from the elementary together with certain changes in the curriculum, this education would be optional but should be made available in all liwas and in most towns. * Zte..» This t/ould comprise secordary education necessary for specialisation and should be restricted to a limited number of boarding schools maintained at the expense of the Government from which students who pass cut successfully would go on to. colleges for special studies or Into State employaent, or the Army ot the Police. tudents for this secondary course would be chosen from among those who gained the best warks In the final examination of the second course without regard to the llwas of their origin, or to their religion, or to their sect, or to their race. Scholarship and competence would be the only factors taken into account. 12. Co-operation between the legislative and the executive authorities calls for-the submission of a programme of reforms to a Parliamentary body^o4y exijoyli.i: cm absolute majority# T Is body my if memsnry ®«et privately outsido Parliament in order to reach decisions but subsequently It u«t become the nueleue of a political party which thereafter is to formed arid which will develop throughout the country outside Parliament. If this is aftlim*, it will be possible to create a constitutional Iraqi' Oomrrment of a rmrty capable to lead the country forward. Xt is therefore apparent that the proper course is to create a new Cabinet of this kind. This fact is apparent on the one hand but on the othor it is clearly necessary to lay down regulations hereby thf- Houses of Parliament siay express their opinion on the legislation submitted to them whether in the affirmative or in the negative or whether it be in fav^^r of amendment without having recourse to ?tere obstruction or procrastination. For it im&amp;t be admitted that such methods have impeded and will continue to impede farliaraentary activity. Moreover since existing ambiguities ti trelevant laws make It possible for either of tlv? Houses of Parliament to set aside any draft law that mmy be submitted to theci 4 ■ without taking a decision oonearttln^ It though the responsible inistwr say ask for the matter to ha dealt with -urgoatly and as in consequence such draft laws nay he left absndoned in one or other &gt;f the Coaaittees, there should he no doubt that this state of affairs taust be remedied at once and as it is custo ary anong constitutional nation-; of the West to regard the silence of one of the Houses of fsrliaraent on a draft law for acre than a specified period to be jonsidered as signifying aereenent of that Mouse to that draft law, it is desirable that the Chaiaber of deputies and the Senate should meet in joint session In accordance with the Organic Law to take a decision In the above sense. They could, for exanpls, decide that twenty or even forty-five days should be the maxlawa period during which a draft law should be left thus abandoned in the Co.vittee. in this way the respective chambers of the Parliaaent would be cotipelled to giv an opinion either for or agalrst th» law axsd In this way it would be possible to give effect completely to the constitution. The formation of a political party In the manner above described wouldwcniM not prevent the eremtio** of a minority party in oppo&amp;im such m alraadiy exists aM BnccmdB with complete success in twlmy*.o. lour Annex Telegrera En Clair• From 11.Ambassador 9 Bagdad.

I hare lately learnt, hoeeyer, that wh« the Sodget was before the Finance Cowaittee a ..ortnlpht afOj certain eafeers did raise the question of reyisiriE speciflo polcts of the Treaty, or rather of the letters annexed thereto. Owing a recent interHw with the Irsol Prise lrlater, therefore, I asked His excellency to enllghtm M oo the snbjeet and In particular acquaint ^ with hie own views. Handi Pschachl at once replied^ that when the matter ms raised in the Finance Cosalttse he said be woald not bear of lt| perhans after the wart not now. The reasoi; people started talking of treaty revision, he went on, was that the Matter had been raised in Egypt, and It ma thosght that what . 1&lt; __ should s. utoraatioally be done here. Bnt, the Prime minister pointed out, relations between Br1talc and Iraq are quite different and far less cosrlicated thaz- those between Britain and Rgypt. 'In Scyyt', .he said, 'yon have the ■..-uestlms ef the Sww Canal and the Swlan, both of which are very difficult. Bare there is no «ajc(r question *• cose between us. In faet the treaty Is a very good treaty, and mere and sore of us realise how such we Iraqis benefit by it'. In this respect I have reason to believe that 'iastdl Bay refresents a large body of responsible oplnloo. 3. I next asked or. what points critics in the Finance Coaislttce had suggested revision. He said J The fhssllng of asbesslMf'. What hie feels, I think. Is that if the Egyptians have m Bsbaasy in. Lordco, Iraa should have one. iut thl* of course. Is only one of rajay factors influer-c- Ing the Iraqi alnd. You are aware froa the exchange of telegrasas endteg with your Ko.473 of Septeaber 30th. 19*4, that the Iraqi Cowernaent have been thinking about the\ l topic for sosae tliae. It smm to me Inevitable that ' sooner or later they will renew and press their request for liberty of action in the sphere of dlploiaatlc repre- sentetlAB. 4. so far as the Iraqi Coveriwient Is concerned, there is no evidence that they resent the dlploaatle friaaoy accorded to Bis Majesty's Be preset! tatlve In Bagdad. It Is, after all, merely the perpetuation of a position which was granted by Turkey to His Majesty's Pepresentative in this country as Iocs ago as 1765.

Sir, Bagdad, 30^ March, 1945. ON the eve of my departure from Bagdad, it may be of interest if I briefly review the situation as it stands to-day at the end of the four years during which I have had the honour to be head of this mission. 2. When I arrived in April 1941 Rashid Ali al Gailani had established a stranglehold on administration throughout the country. His chief supporters were a clique of ambitious politicians and army officers who had been brought up under the old Turkish regime. Rashid Ali was not a popular leader, but by methods which by now have unfortunately become only too familiar, he established an armed dictatorship, and the people,''cowed into acquiescence, could offer no resistance. Few Iraqis dared to visit me during that month. 3. The fundamental reasons for this state of affairs were four. First must be put the gradual weakening of the administration and of the authority of the Government over a period of eight years which was punctuated by coups d'Etat. Next was the fact that, with the death of King Faisal in 1933, the country lost its chief unifying force. His son, King Ghazi, was wild and unbalanJed, and when he met his death m 1938 the Crown passed to a child of 4. The latter's uncle, the Amir Abdul'Illah, who became Regent, was completely inexperienced, a stranger to the country, and hampered by shyness and hesitancy. Nor had he any sensible or capable supporters to help him in establishing his position. He thus fell an easy prey to an unscrupulous gang. Thirdly, there were the Germans. Their old plans for eastern expansion were being revived; and they sent here as their minister a most industrious, experienced and energetic propagandist in Dr. Grobba. In contrast to the task of his British diplomatic colleagues, who sought to guide the footsteps of a mercurial people on to constructive paths, his role was easy : he had to undermine and destroy. In this he was powerfully assisted by the growing might of Germany and by the dynamism that emanated from Berlin and Rome. Britain, on the other hand, seemed to be sunk in apathy. Fourthly, to crown all, came the Arab rebellion in Palestine, and the harsh, but ineffective, measures which we were taking to suppress it. Day after day the German and Italian radio would denounce our actions, and day after day we made no attempt to justify them. Our foreign policy in general was weak and vacillating and our prestige sank steadily. 4. At the same time the contrast between Iraq and other parts of the Arab W ? • t ! WaS . str ^ n S- I 11 Saudi Arabia a strong man was in control of a kingdom which he himself had made, a kingdom which had never been the object of German ambitions. In Egypt and in Palestine we had maintained appreciable military lorces tor strategic reasons. In Syria the people were under control of the French army. In Iraq, however, despite its paramount importance, there were a few British aircraft but no British troops and no effective organisation to fight enemy activities. Over a period of seven or eight years we had sat back and watched our mnuence decline. It was small wonder that, comparing our apparent weak ness and ineffectiveness with the dominating position we had held only ten years betore, the people of Iraq considered that, much as some might regret it our time was done. o © . J' ^ Ifc i Wa T S obyi ° us in 1941 that Rashid Ali hoped, by feigning loyalty to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, to keep His Majesty's Government in play until such time as the Germans were able to send forces to Iraq.

When Bagdad was freed at the end of May 1941 by a small column that could scarcely have reached here had the desert tribes thrown in their lot with Rashid Ali, it became clear that the country in the main was with us, and was much relieved to see the last of that traitor and his gang. But many pro-German pockets still existed, especially in the towns, and there was still the danger of German invasion—invasion from two sides, for at the end of 1941 the enemy stood both upon the frontiers of Egypt and in the foothills of the Caucasus. In these circumstances my aim was— (a) To secure full facilities for our war requirements and unimpeded oppor tunities for training and defensive measures by our navy, army and Royal Air Force. {h) To root out pro-Nazis and bring about a change in public feeling, both to facilitate {a) and, looking further ahead, to consolidate our future position by making people realise the advantage of alliance with us. (c) Unofficially and in the hope of helping to create* greater stability, to influence the administration as far as possible, but not to the extent of causing a crisis and so jeopardising (ci) and (&amp;). Owing to my per sonal knowledge of the working of the governmental machine and my old friendship with Ministers, shaikhs and others, I happened to be favourably placed for this. 7. To attain («) and (&amp;) it was necessary to get in touch with all classes of society, who had been neglected for years, and to proceed by a co-ordinated plan. Accordingly, I formed a political advisory staff, whose duty was to act as liaison omcers between our army and Iraqi officials, especially in the provinces, to fight enemy propaganda, to make friends with leaders and, generally, to restore British in ^ U&lt; k I1C f'i Was e ^ tremel y fortunate in securing the services of several officers who had long experience of Iraq and were liked and respected by its inhabitants. Iney, with their young assistants, have produced remarkable results. They quickly helped to stabilise the country, and they are now frequently invited to assist m administrative problems. They have worked closely with the Public JxelaUons staff, which, m addition to ordinary propaganda work pf press and radio has done much to increase knowledge of Britain and the British by the establishment of reading rooms, the operation of travelling cinemas, and above all by establishing personal contact with people in all walks of life.

In short it has been my endeavour to establish, through every possible means, closer relations between Iraqis of all classes and individual Britons and I now have the^satisfaction of recording that to-day Britons and Iraqis £ t IwT 6 ^ dld tef0re -. M y task has been made easier by the fact that Iraqis as a whole were not with Rashid Ali, and that his revolt came as a profound shock to theim They were ashamed, and wanted to make amends Consequently we received full co-operation, both from the Government and from the people as a; whole, even m the most difficult days of 1941 and 1942 As a proof of this, it is to be noted that suspects of all kinds were enereeticallv rounded up and interned, that the Iraqi authorities themselves of their owi motion, tried and hanged three of the four members of the Golden Square who fell into their hands, and that all Rashid All's Ministers who are not in exile are in prison. Not a murmur has been heard from anyone against the execution of these drastic sentences. 9. As regards the question of influencing the Administration, it is not perhaps always realised how difficult Iraq is to govern. Unlike Egypt and the Levant, before the British occupation Iraq had been subject to almost no Western influences. The country consisted in fact of three of the most neglected provinces of a moribund empire. In addition, it was and is divided by secular feuds and differences—the Shia still nurtures his 1,000-year-old resentment (against the Sunni, the Kurd is antagonistic to the Arab, the Christian and Jewish communities (two of the most ancient of their kind in existence any where) are apprehensive of the Moslem majority. Townsmen have little in common with tribesmen, who are heavily armed and accustomed from time immemorial to resist by force any encroachment on their privileges. This complex society calls for the highest standard of administration. Moreover, Iraq has many hundred miles of wild land frontiers, with potentially trouble some neighbours, Turkey, Persia and Saudi Arabia. Even in peace-time it is a difficult country to govern, but with the dislocation, mostly economic, which the war has inevitably brought with it, it is small wonder that the people have felt discontented with their Government. To deal with this situation the Iraqi Government had at their disposal a corps of officials, few of whom had received a Western education, and most of whom had been corrupted by ten years of misrule. Working with them was a very small group of British officials. Fortunately, the Iraqi Government realised their own shortcomings and applied increasingly to us for help, with the result that there are now more British officials in the Government than for many years past. Indeed, we cannot supply all the officers that are wanted. Of their own volition the Iraqi Government have, since 1941, placed Britons in executive charge of Imports and Exports, Irrigation, the Veterinary Service and the Transport Service, and we have also Britons as heads of the Port and of the Railways administrations. In all the Ministries where they are employed British advisers are now effectively consulted. This has applied particularly to education, which before was a focus of anti- British agitation. On the whole, therefore, in spite of much corruption and inefficiency, it is only fair to record that the Iraqis have risen well to the occasion. Everywhere public security is good and taxes are collected. There is naturally grumbling about the high cost of living, the shortage of textiles and other commodities, but it is not serious. Only in Kurdistan to-day is there a potentially dangerous tension. 10. While the position is therefore comparatively satisfactory, it would be most misleading to pretend that it will automatically remain so. The problem of government without experienced assistance is too difficult for these people in their present state of development. This is clear now. It will become even clearer when British troops, which have done so much to steady the situation during the last four years, are withdrawn after the war. Besides the inherent stresses which I have* described in paragraph 9, there are too many personal hates and rivalries, too little mutual confidence and public spirit, and too much intrigue to ensure stability and' continuity, without some external influence. The Regent, although he showed considerable personal courage in 1941, and although his affection for Britain is beyond question, is none the less no leader. He has many of the qualities and defects of his father. With his private friends (most of whom are British) he has an easy, natural manner, and he likes and is liked by the Iraqi army, whose exercises he constantly attends, and which he is determined shall not again, if he can help it, be used against him. But he finds his public duties a very heavy burden, largely because there is no Iraqi in whom he feels he can place implicit confidence. He therefore needs propping up all the time. There is no present alternative to him, and in any case another change in the head of the State would be most unfortunate. It must always be borne in mind that the Regent is far from being a mere figure-head. In fact, though not in theory, almost every appointment, every measure of administration, is subject to his personal wish. The chief politicians with whom, for some few years more, must rest the leadership of the Cabinet are individualists. When they get into office their chief preoccupation is to score off their opponents, and to undermine hostile combinations in the Senate. No Cabinet can endure long enough to produce continuity or stability. It is we who should provide the latter, and I fear that we must do it for some tune to come; because the rising generation, while it has produced many ardent critics, has hitherto furnished no men of courage or action. So far as the educated class is concerned, it is a generation of Hamlets. The malcontents of the so-called intelligentsia have pretended in this country, as in others, to be attracted to Russian political ideas. There are probably less than a score of people m Iraq who have even the most superficial knowledge of the Russian political system, but ' communism ' has become a cloak for any critical opinion, whether honestlv or dishonestly held. Some old Nazi wolves, wearing Communist clothing, have already established themselves in the ' progressive ' fold. This problem will increase and will, indeed, become one of the most difficult which we have to face. We .have in the past, here as elsewhere, been accused of backing [65—56] ' B 2&lt;£ the old gang.' To some extent we have done so, but, as I have explained above, it has been a question of force majeure, for no new gang has so far emerged; and until it does, if the Government is to be maintained at all, it must be through those who have held sway hitherto. The real trouble lies not with us, but with the rulers themselves, who obstinately refuse to give up any of their privileges or prerogatives to others. There are now signs that they are becoming apprehensive for their future, and I and my staff continually do the best we can to stimulate their apprehension; for unless they do make some con cessions, a violent clash between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots' is inevitable in time. 11. If Iraq were not important to us, it might pay us to get out, but it is, in fact, extremely important. In addition to its strategic position, its oil and its communications, we have a third reason. We cannot afford to neglect Iraq in view of the interest which Russia and the United States are now taking in the Middle East. We no longer hold the field alone. But how are we to maintain our position ? What means can we use ? The whole tendency of all Middle East countries is, as you are aware, to eliminate foreign influence as soon as possible. Already in Egypt there is clamour for a modification of the treaty. In Iraq extremists are beginning to raise the same cry, though without so far signifying any single particular in which they consider revision desirable. In such an atmosphere it is obvious that any idea of tightening control by force, or of keeping permanently larger forces than those defined in the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, is completely out of date. Nevertheless, it is possible for us to maintain our place here, and indeed, to enhance it; because there is no doubt whatever that Iraq is fundamentally far more friendly to us than to any other Power, now or at any other time, and it is worth while to keep it so. In his speech of farewell to me last week the Minister for Foreign Affairs publicly declared that the policy of the Iraqi Government was'to continue to employ ' British scientists and experts in various branches and to train Iraqis in Great Britain to be scientists and experts.' In the same speech his Excellency stated that Iraq's friendship with Britain is the cornerstone of her policy. This statement, which would have been branded as '' treachery '' four years ago, has been widely acclaimed, both in public and in private. This feeling rests on a sound basis; for more and more people in Iraq are coming to see that the treaty, which at the time when it was signed was by many regarded as a bond of servitude, is, in fact, a guarantee of freedom. They realise that by granting us concessions as regards oil and communications (from both of which Iraq materially benefits) they have engaged us to maintain their frontiers; and they acknowledge that in a war in which so many frontiers have been obliterated we have held these inviolate without ever, even- after 1941, encroaching on Iraq's internal independence. 12. The desiderata I consider for the maintenance of our present relations are :— {a) Sympathetic and understanding treatment of Iraq's problems by His Majesty's Government, especially of economic problems and those connected with the change over from war to peace in the next few years. Such treatment will make these people feel that, apart from other considerations, their close associations with us redound to their material benefit. I have been told that some departments in London are antagonistic to Iraq because they think Iraqis are grasping. They are, and so are all Orientals—and perhaps some Westerners too. As Bismarck said of the Balkans ; ' Liberated nations are not grateful— they are exacting.' But it is of British interests that we should think, and we should realise that by downing Iraq we injure ourselves. We should not be weak, but we should be fair and just, and we should avoid like the plague adopting a 'tough line' just to be tough. Above all, we should avoid any action which might injure the amour-fro'pre of the country and its citizens. They are a small people, at the beginning of their independent existence, and it is natural that they should have an adolescent sensitiveness. Almost over night public opinion can change. An inconsiderate act or speech produces an exaggerated despondency, and a kind word an equally disproportionate buoyancy. (&amp;) The officials we send here should be of sound character and knowledge. An ambassador's influence must always be limited by the nature of his office. Our real influence should be inside the Government, through British officials. If we provide good men, there is no reason why Iraq should not ask for more, but there is nothing to gain in forcing officials on the Iraqi Government, and we must always remember that Iraqis are very critical of foreigners, whom theypay so very much higher than their own Ministers, and are quick to spot a second- rater. I have long held that the provision of the most suitable men will be best assured by the creation of a Middle East personnel pool, embracing the Foreign Office, Colonial Office and India Office, from which trained and competent men could be seconded. I trust that some such plan may soon materialise. (c) It is most important that we should maintain the personal contacts which we have created. We should therefore keep on the organisations of Political Advisorate and Public Relations for as long as possible. When the time comes to give them up, we must hope that there will be some administrative inspectors or land settlement officers in the districts. Failing this, we should consider ^he establishment of more consulates whose duties would be mainly politico-social. The British Institutes must be encouraged and the more British officials we can get into the Education Department, both in the towns and in the districts, the better. The Oriental Secretariat of this embassy will become more important as the other organisations change or disappear, and it must- place high value on personal contacts. 13. A relationship between Iraq and Britain has developed which places us in a strong and enviable position. It will- I consider, be our own fault if we allow that position to deteriorate. We must be continually on our guard and on the alert, for - naturally we have many enemies and critics, not all of them Iraqi. Finally, we must take into account in all our actions the new feeling of solidarity and unity which animates the whole Arab world. The Arabs them selves have publicly acknowledged that it is we who have sponsored it and that it is we who have made its realisation possible. It is all the more important, therefore, to consider the Arab world as one, and not as various units on the map, to be handled individually or in sections by different Government depart ments. Our policy towards the Middle East as a whole, it seems to me, requires greater co-ordination. It may, for example, seem a small thing in London to present the King of Egypt with an aircraft and to make the Regent of Iraq pay for his. But such an incident can have serious consequences as implying favouritism. And, as Lord Killearn has stated, we must be on our guard against the painful gibe that the only way to get anything out of the British is to kick them. 14. Any action which we take in regard to Syria or Palestine, for instance, will, as I have often emphasised, have a direct and immediate bearing on our position, influence and prospects in Iraq; and it is to the maintenance of British interests and British influence that our efforts should be primarily and consistently devoted. It is creditable to any man that he should feel moved to pity and sym pathy by the sufferings of the Jews, or the Assyrians, or the Kurds or the Arabs; but you cannot govern by sentiment. Political lines of force do not change, and the laws of geography and history cannot be revoked. Our interests in this part -of the world have been identical for more than 200 years. Originally those interests were selfish. They are no longer so, for, whether we will it or not, the lives and fortunes of all the inhabitants of the Middle East are as directly bound up with the maintenance of our position as were those of their ancestors with the existence of the Roman Empire. Were we to be driven from our paramount position here, the Middle East would dissolve in a chaos such as that which enveloped it when the Roman Empire decayed. In time, it may well be, other nations will be willing to share our responsibilities, as they are already eager to share our privileges. But that day has yet to come. Until it dawns, it is for us to maintain our own, and by so doing to preserve and enhance the tranquillity and prosperity of this ancient and historic land. 15. I cannot close this last despatch without recording how much I owe to my own staff. I have endeavoured to show that such success as has been achieved during the last four years has been due to the united efforts of a good many depart ments and people working in harmony to a definite end.' In this concerted plan, the embassy staff had a vital and essential part to play, and I cannot speak too highly of the manner in which, one and all, they have acquitted themselves I owe them a deep debt of gratitude. 16.
