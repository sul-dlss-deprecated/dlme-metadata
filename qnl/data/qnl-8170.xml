The question of the exact demarcation of the boundary was raised because of a need to set the administrative boundary between the Political Agent in Muscat and the Political Resident in Aden and, later, the division of areas of responsibility between the air authorities in Iraq and Aden. In 1947 the question is raised again during a period of exploration for oil.The file contains the following papers:Notes on his explorations of the Rub' Al Khali and the territory of the Mahra tribe by Bertram Sidney Thomas, dated 4 March 1930 and 10 January 1947 respectively (folios 97 and 27)Notes on the transliteration and meaning of place names by Claude Edward Urquhart Bremner, Political Agent in Muscat (folio 62)An Account of his journey to Qishn and Socotra by Captain Tom Hickinbotham, Civil Secretary in Aden, 26 April 1935 (folios 53-57)A sketch map of Dhofar by Bertram Thomas (folio 10).The principal correspondents are the Air Ministry, Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Government of India (Foreign Department), Political Residency in Aden, Admiralty, India Office, and the Political Agency in Muscat.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Residency, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Bertram Sidney Thomas</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001f9#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001f9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
