Later, when Bin'Sand gave a banquet to the foreign representatives and notables of Jeddah, they again refused to attend, though they were accepting his hospitality even to the extent oi' their daily food. Seeing that there was nothing further for them to do in the llejaz, uie)' took the first opportunity of leaving, and actually sailed for India by the steamship ' Jehangir,' which left Jeddah on the -Gth January. ) During their stay in Jeddah they exhorted Bin Saud not to surrender Ala an and Akaba to the British, as they considered it holy territory. I his subject, I learned, was also discussed between themselves and Mr. St. J. Phil by at Rabigh, who, in addition to informing them that they should insist on this point, informed them also that His Majesty's Government had been paying large sums of money to Bin baud. I his incensed them somewhat, and they were at great pains to verify this luioimation in Jeddah. . . . They are returning to India rather crestfallen, and it would not he suipiismg i, they launch out on a policy directed against Bin Saud as soon as 'hey return. Shuaib Kureshi's application for a visa to proceed to the I nited Kingdom now appears to have been an excuse for calling at this agency, and as soon as 1 realised tiiis 1 took no further action in the matter. .... t ^ S.

Agency Jeddah, February 27th 1926. W 1 Sir, I have the honour to enclose herewith a translation of a letter received from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Hejaz relating to the Indian Deputation under the Presidency of one Said Habib and calling itself the Khudam ul Haramain Deputation (servants of Kaaba). 2. The actions of the deputation since their arrival in the Hejaz have been deplorable and it is not at all surprising tiiat Bin Saud has at last been forced to take action. 3. Upon the arrival of this committee in Jeddah they were invited by Bin Saud to become his guests. This they indignantly refused stating that they did not recognise him as ruler of the Hejaz. Whereupon Bin Saud told them that it was unreasonable on their part to take up a hostile and antagonistic attitude without first having had an opportunity of judging the new regime and that with good intentions on both sides he was sure an agreement could be reached upon all outstanding questions. 4. The deputation thereupon accepted Bin Saud^ hospitality and soon afterwards proceeded to Mecca. 5. During their stay in Mecca they have maintained their attitude of open hostility and I am informed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Government have actual proof of their efforts to create disturbances and to render the people dissatisfied with the present regime. To this end they Britannic Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, rv FOREIGN OFFICE,S.W.I.they have apparently spent a large part of the 12,000 rupees wnich they were supposed to have brought from India for relief amongst the poor, distributing a hundred or so rupees here and there tv further their intrigues and propaganda against Bin Saud and to date have spent none whatever in relief work. 6. As an indication of their action and the stupid manner in which they are behaving may be mentioned the fact that in a written notification addressed to Abdul Aziz, Sultan of Lejd, they call upon him to depart from the Haramain and the Hejaz and take all his soldiers with him as the Hejaz belongs to the world * s mo si cms . 7 # in many similar ways they are manifesting their open hostility and one of the first demands they presented to Bin Saud was to he furnished with a copy of the treaty existing between Nejd and Great Britain. 8. As the Sultan is anxious to maintain peace in the country now that the pilgrimage is approaching he saw no otner alternative but to request this deputation to leave the country, and I understand that they will leave by the Khedivial s.s.

Sir , I -ia/e the -ionour to report that the new silver w oi as &lt; ^- 1 v/hich mention lias heen made in recent reports (Jeddah Report for June 1927, paragraph 12 and Jeddah Report .or October 1927, paragraph 30), havii% now arrived in sufficient quantities, a regulation has been issued by the Hejaz-Nejd Government to be known as 'the Hejd-Hejaz coinage regulation.' 2. The regulation comes into force on January 23 1927. The basis of exchar^e is the gold pound sterling, the value of which is fixed at ten Arab Mejidiehs (dollars), Tne exchange value of the dollar is fixed at eleven piastres Miri or twenty two local piastres. The parity of exchange of One pound is therefore one hundred and ten piastres Miri Ox to hundred and twenty local piastres. 3. lurkish and :Iaria Theresa dollars introduced into the country will be regarded as specie and will pay customs duty. The new silver coinage is exchangeable against gold by the Finance Department on demand at the above mentioned rates and a special department is to be opened for this purpose. The right to mint new coins is reserved to the Government. 4. The minimum penalty for issuing counterfeit coins is three months Imprisonment and One hundred pounds fine. All damaged and defaced coins will be immediately withdrawn from circulation by Inspectors empowered to examine coins circulating in the market. Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 5.5. It is hoped that the introduction of this new coinage at a fixed rate of exchange will eliminate the vagaries of exchange from which the hejaz has suffered of recent years. The supply of silver and nickel coins has invariaoly fallen short of the needs of the country during tne oilgrimage with the result that as few as one hundred and ninety piastres as against the normal rate of two hundred and twenty were at times obtainable for one pound gold and the temptation to hoard silver coins has been great in the certain knowledge that a good profit can be made thereon in the season. 6. a translation of the regulation under reference is transmitted herewith together with designs of the new silver coinage. I have &lt;ScC ., (Signed) F .h .W. Stonehewer Bird.3' REGUL A TIQII Tiie Hejaz-ilej d coins.

J CONFIDENTIAL Section 4. [E 1397/200/91] No. 1. Acting Consul Jordan to Government of India.—{Copy to Foreign 0jjice in despatch No. 8; received March 1.) (Secret.) Sir, Jeddah, January 29, I92i). [N continuation of my telegram No. 14 of the 28th January, addressed to the Foreign Office and repeated to you, I have the honour to transmit herewith a report on the activities of the Khilafat delegation as far as has been ascertainable by the means at the disposal of this agency. Copies of this despatch and report are being sent to the Foreign Office. THE Khilafat delegation, under the presidency of Vfaulana Zafar Ali Khan, of the newspaper ' Zaemendar,' and with Shuaib Kureshi as secretary, arrived in Rabigh towards the middle of December, and, after a stay of some days in Rabigh, proceeded to Medina to verify the reported acts of vandalism on the part of the Wahabi forces. Shuaib Kureshi, who called at this office, informed me personally that the reports on this subject were grossly exaggerated and that he found that the dome of the Prophet's Tomb had been hit in three places only, and one of them was certainly by a bullet fired from the Jebel Silah by the Sherifian forces, who had established their headquarters on that hill. The Syedna Hamza Tomb was intact except for several marks made by shrapnel fired by the Sherifian forces and the fact that some of the carpets or covering of the bier were missing. A small tomb not far from the Syedna Hamza had been destroyed, but was later repaired. Shuaib Kureshi also stated that he had taken photographs of the various monuments and prepared a report on the matter, which would be published in India in due course. After their visit to Medina was completed they proceeded to Mecca and had several audiences with Bin Saud, but, as far as can be ascertained, they were treated with but scant respect and given to understand that if India really vnshed to have some say in the control of the Hejaz there were more concrete ways of showing it than by sending penniless delegations who were dependent on the Hejaz even for their food whilst here. After the fall of Jeddah they came to this place and began to investigate the extent of British interference in the matter of mediation between the Sherifs and Bin Saud and what propaganda they could make out of it. ft must be counted a success on the part of His Majesty's Government's policy that, after these people had been running all over the place endeavouring to find some excuse for criticism and hearing nothing but good spoken on all sides and how, had it not been for the actions of His Majesty's representative, bloodshed could not have been avoided, they were, reluctantly perhaps, forced to admit likewise, and remarked to Munshi Ihsanullah, employed at this agency, and several other local Indians gathered in his house, that it was the only good thing that Sheitan Government had ever accomplished.' The delegation was still in Jeddah when Bin Saud was declared King of the Hejaz at Mecca, and when news reached them to this effect they became very excited and angry, and declared that Bin Saud, by his acceptance of this position, had given the lie to all his previous declarations about the Hejaz, and had thereby insulted the delegation.
