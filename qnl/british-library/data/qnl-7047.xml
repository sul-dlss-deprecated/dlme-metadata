Ahrcrit INDIA OFFICE, KOWEIT, 1908-1928. A.—Administration. 1. Sheikh Ahmad-al Jabir, C.LE. (January 1922', born 1885, has ruled Koweit since March 1921, when his succession to his uncle, Sheikh Salim (born 1864, succeeded 1917, died 23rd February 1921), who had ruled since the death of Sheikh Jabir Ibn Mabarak in 1917, was recognised by His Majesty’s Government, subject, it would appear, to agreement to impose and enforce through his territory such further restrictions on the arms traffic as might be considered desirable. On the invitation of His Majesty’s Government, the Sheikh visited the United Kingdom in October 1919, as the representative of his uncle, with the son of Ibn Sand, and was received by the King. His Excellency is entitled to a permanent salute of seven guns, the number having been reduced from 12 (personal) on his accession. 2. The principality is an independent Arab State, under British protection, but not a British protectorate. 0 Its ruler is precluded by his engagements, of which an abstract is printed in the Precis of Treaties appended to this Memorandum, from receiving foreign representatives, and from ceding, leasing, mortgaging, or giving for occupation, or any other purpose, any portion of its territory to any foreigner or foreign Power without the sanction of His Majesty’s Government; he is bound to suppress slave traffic and to prohibit traffic in arms within his territories ; and he has agreed not to give a concession for oil, or for pearl fishing, without the approval of His Majesty’s Government. 3. The internal administration is conducted by the Sheikh, assisted in theory by an elected Council of Advisers (two from the Subah or reigning family, four from the inhabitants, elected for one year), acceptance of which was made for the first time a condition of recognition by the people of Koweit on the accession of the present Sheikh.f The Council, though duly elected, has, however, never met.;}: 4. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are represented by the Political Agent (at present Major J. C. More, D.S.O.), an appointment created in 1904, maintained since that date save for a brief interval in 1905, and borne on the cadre of the Indian Political Department. The Political Agent is directly subordinate to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. He does not hold His Majesty’s Commission as a Consul or exercise Consular functions. Under the Koweit Order in Council of 1925 (see paras. 24-27 below), he is the District Magistrate and Sessions Judge, and exercises his powers subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the limits of his jurisdiction are the territories and territorial waters of Koweit, and he exercises jurisdiction inter alius over British subjects and protected persons, and over the subjects and protected persons (not being subjects or protected persons of Muslim Governments) of Foreign States in respect of whom the Foreign States concerned may agree to the exercise of such jurisdiction. 5. The effect of the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee of 1921 was to leave control of the internal administration and affairs of Koweit to the Government of India (to whom, and not to His Majesty’s Government, the Political Resident in the Gulf was instructed in 1924 to look for orders regarding them), subject to the general control of His Majesty’s Government, and to the prior concurrence of the Colonial Office in matters of political significance. Questions of policy, especially questions affecting relations with Ibn Sand, fell to be dealt with by the Colonial Office. The question of the channels through which the instructions of His Majesty’s Government are to issue on matters affecting the Principality is dealt with in para. 5 of the Note on Political Control in the Persian Gulf on page 6. Expenditure on Koweit is divided between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. In the latest year for which figures are available (1926-7) it amounted to Rs. 45,683, plus payments in respect of pension contribution amounting to Rs. 9,423, a total of Rs. 55,106. 2979c 75 10.28 C.O. to H.C., Iraq, April 2 1921, P. 1758/21.

The history of Koweit up to 1907 is given in the foreign Office Memorandum of 1908. At the time when that memorandum was composed and until the beginning of the War, Koweit was of vital interest to Great Britain in connection with the Baghdad Bailway, and during the period 1908-14 His Majesty’s Government, in their relations with the Sheikh, had primarily in view the consolidation of their position and influence in Koweit in the face of the efforts of Germany to establish herself at the head of the Gulf.

The vexed question of the rights of the Sheikh of Koweit over the islands of Bubiyan and Warba, dealt with in the Foreign Office Memorandum, was carefully investigated by the local authorities and the Government of India in 1907-9. The conclusions which emerged were that enquiry had gone far to establish the claims of the Sheikh to the ownership of Bubiyan, but that no satisfactory evidence had been produced as to his claims to Warba ; and in the circumstances His Majesty’s Government decided that it was inadvisable to raise any question of the rights of the Sheikh to either island. (Both islands were recognised as falling within the dominions of the Sheikh of Koweit by the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 29th July 1913.) Secret Desp. from G. of I., 89 Desp. to P Desp. from Sir G.

Circumstances, however, intervened to make an immediate demarche by Sir G. Lowther from time to time unnecessary or undesirable, and the question merged in the general Anglo-Turkish negotiations initiated in 1911. P. 2062/11. * P. 4214/14 (et seq.), P. 2442/18, P. 5951/19. 10. The Sheikh undertook in 1911 not to grant a pearl fishing concession to foieigneis save with the prior approval of His Majesty’s Government, and gave a similar undertaking as regards oil in 1913. Subsequent developments as regards oil concessions are dealt with in para. 29 below. With the assistance of a loan of £12,500 from the Government of India, arrano-ements were made in 1914 for the installation by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, on behalf of the Sheikh, of a water distilling plant, which was not however brought into operation until 1919.* question of Koweit played an important part in the Anolo lurkish negotiations of 1911-14. An agreement was reached, and a Convention, to give effect to it, signed on 29th July 1913. Under this agreement, in the terms of which the concurrence of the Sheikh had been secured, die territory of Koweit was recognised as an autonomous caza of the Ottoman Lmpire ; the Ottoman flag was to be flown by the Sheikh but he was to have the right to insert a distinctive emblem in the corner’- he was to continue to be a Turkish Kaimakam, and his successors were to be appointed to a similar position by the Ottoman Government- the full admunstrative autonomy of the Sheikh was recognised within the territories of Koweit proper, the limits of which were defined bv the red circle on Map Lo II appended to this Memorandum ; within a surrounding area (included within a green line on the map) which was occupied bv%ribes recognised as dependent on him, he was, as in the past, to continue to levv tubute and to perform the administrative duties of Turkish Kaimuhim^ in both regions I nrkey undertook to abstain entirely from anv interference’ though the light to appoint a Commissioner at Koweit “to m-ofpot fl ’ interests and subjects of other parts of the Empire ” was seeded to her existing agreements between the Sheikh and His MaiestvC p ’ including the Secret Agreement of 18y9, “fe redgnl ef bv fhe oT™ 1 ’ Government, and His Majesty’s Government engaged that so In,3 » change was made ,n the statu., 7 uo as now defined, they would not'itel thenature of British relations with the Government of Koweit or establish a Protectorate there. A subsidiary article (9) secured to the Sheikh the enjoyment of his private property in the Basra \ilayet. 12. The outbreak of war in August 1914 prevented the final ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement the substance of which is summarised above, and the entry of Turkey into the War in November 1914 against the Allies produced a completely new situation. The Sheikh, who had been informed officially on 8th August 1914 of the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Germany, on 21st August made a declaration of loyalty to His Majesty’s Government on behalf of himself and his tribes,’'* placed “ his efforts, his men, and his ships ” at the disposal of Great Britain, and expressed a desire to eject the Turkish garrison from the islands at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, which he claimed to be lawfully his. In return for his co-operation against the Turks the Sheikh, in a letter from the Political Resident in the Gulf, dated 3rd November 1914,j* was given the following assurances, of which the third is the most important:— (1) The date gardens which you now possess between Fao and Gurnah shall remain in the full possession of you and jour heirs and be immune from taxation. (2) You are guaranteed by the Great British Government against all consequences of your attack against Safwan, Umm Kasr and Bubiyan. (3) Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection. 13. In February 1915 sanction was given to the transfer to Koweit of the Admiralty coaling depot at Bushire,J a step originally recommended by the Government of India in 1910, and approved in 1912 by the Foreign Office, Admiralty and India Office, the taking of which had however hitherto been postponed in view of the possibility that it might prejudicially react on the Anglo-Turkish negotiations. But on the recommendations of the Naval authorities it was agreed in 1916 that the proposal should be dropped until the conclusion of the War. It was decided in 1920 that the transfer should not take place. 14. It had been agreed in 1913 that an Indian Post Office should be established at Koweit on the ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Convention ; and an office w r as in fact opened under the orders of the Government of India at the beginning of 1915. 15. Sheikh Mubarak (K.O.I.E. 1911, K.O.S.L 1914\ who had ruled Koweit since his assassination of his brother in 1896, and who had consistently co-operated actively with His Majesty’s Government, died on 28th November 1915, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sheikh Jabir, who was informed in March 1916 by the Viceroy that “ so long as you act up to existing arrangements with the British Government you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.” 16. In the earlier part of 1915 Koweit had been brought in intimate contact with the affairs of Ibn Sand on the revolt of the Ajman tribe against the latter. The Ajman were finalty routed in September, and forced to take refuo-e in Koweit territory, in which they remained until the death of Mubarak, immediately on which Ibn Sand pressed his successor, Sheikh Jabir, to expel the Ajman Sheikhs, a demand to which Jabir, reluctant to eject the Ajman lest they should be driven into the enemy camp, but unable to hold out against Ibn Sand’s pressure without creating an open breach, finally yielded in February 1916. 17. Relations between Ibn Sand and Koweit had for some years before the death of Mubarak been growing cooler. Ibn Sand had latterly resented what he regarded as the equivocal attitude of the Sheikh during the negotiations between the Ottoman Government and himself in the spring of 1914; the asylum given to the Ajman w r as a further grievance,§ and the incidence of the transit dues levied from time immemorial in Koweit, formed the subject of a complaint by the ruler of Nejd in 1916.

Darbar held at Koweit on 20th November 1910, and attended by Ibn Sand, the Sheikh of Mohammerah, Sheikh Jabir of Koweit and Sir Percy Cox, for the purpose of investing the Sheikh of Koweit with the C.S.I., the three chiefs swore together to work with His Majesty’s Government for the achievement of a common end.^j 18. On the death on 5th February 1917, of Sheikh Jabir “in whose weak hands ” to quote the Political Agent,Government in Koweit “ had almost collapsed,” His Majesty’s Government approved the recognition as successor of his brother Sheikh Salim, to whom an assurance similar to that granted to his predecessor and quoted above was conveyed by the Viceroy in March 1917. The new Sheikh was a man of very different calibre from Sheikh Jabir. Narrow in outlook, bigoted in religious matters, tactless in his personal relations, his marked individuality and strength of purpose none the less made it possible for the Political Agent to report in the spring of 1918 that he had “ established himself in a brief space of time very securely in the Sheikhdom.” But the qualities which helped him to assert himself locally shortly set him at odds with both His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud. 19. Difficulty arose with the latter over the Ajman tribe, whom Salim allowed in October J917 to return to Koweit, and over the respective rights of Ibn Saud and the . Sheikh to levy tribute on the Awazim tribe, and formed the subject of vigorous complaint by Ibn Saud at thp end of 1917. In July 1918, Mr. Philby represented that Ajman activities based on Koweit territory were causing widespread resentment in Nejd and leading to remonstrance from Ibn Saud as to the inadequacy of our support. Measures to meet this grievance—the location of a mobile column in Koweit territory, the stationing of a British post at Safwan Wells, the occupation of Koweit itself—were under exami nation when, in September 1918, Lord Allenby’s victories in Palestine made the removal of the blockade possible and temporarily eased the situation, and no action was taken beyond warning the leading Sheiks that if raids continued their subsidies would cease. 20. Difficulty with His Majesty’s Government arose over the strict main tenance in Koweit territories and ports of the blockade imposed in (?) 1915[| with a view to preventing the leakage of supplies to the enemy, whether in Mesopotamia or in the isolated Turkish garrisons at Medina and elsewhere in the Arabian peninsula — a blockade, not unnaturally unpopular with Koweit merchants, the strictness of which was relaxed by Salim. The Sheikh subsequently adopted an attitude so obstructive in the matter that, after prolonged consideration, it was found necessary to warn him through the Political Resident, on 5th July 1918, that the assurances conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should acts “ contrary to the interests of (His Majesty’s) Government ” “ unfortunately be committed in future,” he would be held personally responsible.! The hint was not wasted ; the Sheikh for the remainder of the war maintained a less unsatisfactory attitude towards His Majesty’s Government,! and his co-operation in the matter of the blockade was recognised at the end of 1918 by the grant of the C.S.I. and of a lump sum of 3 lakhs of rupees, and by the cancellation of the claim of the Government of India in respect of the loan of £12,500 made in connection with the Koweit water supply in 1914§ (see para. 10 above). 21. On the conclusion of the war His Excellency despatched his nephew, the present Sheikh, to offer his congratulations to the King on its successful outcome, and there has been no friction of importance since then with His Majesty’s Government. (2).—1919-28. 22. The termination of the war necessitated a decision as to the status of Koweit, which His Majesty’s Government had promised in November 1914 to recognise as an independent principality under British protection. The declaration of a British protectorate over the State, as over Bahrein, &amp;c., which was mooted by the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, met with no support from the Government of India, who took exception to it || It lias not been possible to ascertain the precise date.5 »&gt; o v % ; as likely to roose suspicion in the neighbouring Arab peoples, to provoke the jealousy of other Powers, and to involve His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in heavy obligations, both military and financial. Their view was accepted by the Secretary of State for India; the proposal was dropped and matters continued to rest on the declaration of 1914 quoted in para. 12 above. On the general question of status being specifically raised in connection with the preparation of a Koweit Order in Council, the Foreign Office in July 1921 expressed the view that, from the legal standpoint and on the understanding that there was no intention of including Koweit within the boundaries of Mesopotamia, “the status of this territory would appear to be governed by Article 132 of the Treaty of Sevres.” It was subsequently agreed that a final decision •on the question of status must await the signature of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, and, the Treaty of Lausanne having been signed in the autumn of 1923, steps were taken to introduce an Order in Council providing for British jurisdiction within the territory of the Sheikh. That territory, as stated in para. 2 above, may now be regarded as an independent Arab State under British protection, but not a British protectorate. 23. The questions of most importance which have arisen in Koweit since the conclusion of the War are the following :— A. Internal: — (1) Koweit Order in Council providing for British jurisdiction within the Principality. (2) Termination of the lease of Bunder Shweikh. B. External:— (1) Relations with Ibn Saud — (а) Koweit-Nejd-Iraq boundary question ; (б) Koweit-Nejd Customs question ; (c) The Akhwan menace. (2) Relations with Iraq — (a) Exemption from taxation of date gardens in Iraq of the Sheikh of Koweit; (b) Position of Koweit vis-a-vis Iraq. (3) Relations with Persia. Internal Questions, 1919-28. *(a) The Koweit Order in Council. 24. The question of extending the scope of the “ Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1907,” had been under consideration before the War, but no decision had been reached upon it, the difficulty in respect of Koweit having principally been the undesirability of taking action* before a •settlement should have been arrived at with Turkey in regard to the Arab Littoral. In December 1919 the Civil Commissioner at Baghdad again raised* the question of passing a jurisdictional Order in Council for Koweit. The India Office expressed the opinion, however,! that, although the Order was desirable in itself and though there would be advantage in issuing it at an early date, it was desirable to postpone action until a decision had been taken on the machinery for the administration of the Mesopotamian Mandate and the effect of the Mandate upon the relations of His Majesty’s Government with contiguous countries. This view was accepted by the Foreign Office^ and the matter was allowed to rest for a year. 25. The question was again raised in the summer of 1921 by the High Commissioner in Iraq, who recommended (a view in which the Government •of India concurred)^ that the promulgation of an Order in Council need not be further delayed now that Turkey was recognised as having lost suzerainty ■over the Principality. The matter was referred to the Colonial Office who, under the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee, had become responsible for policy on the Arab Littoral of the Persian Gulf. On reference to the Foreign Office they were informed that, from the legal point of view and on the supposition that there was no intention of including Koweit within the boundaries of Mesopotamia, the status of that territory would seem to be governed by Article 132 of the Treaty of Sevres under which Letter from F.O. to I.O., July 25 1921, P. 3495. * Letter from C.C. to G. of I., Dec. 22, 1919, P. 697/20. t I.O. letter to F.O., Jane 8 1920, P. 3733/20. t F.O. to I.O., Jane 14 1920, P. 4660/20. § Tel. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I., 241 S., Feb. 22, 1921, P. 1173/21.G C,0. to F.O., July 9 1921, P. 3078/21.

Turkey renounced in favour of the principal Allied Powers all rights and’ title over territories outside Europe not otherwise disposed of by the Treaty ; that, in practice, provided some prior agreement were reached with the Sheikh of Koweit, it would appear unlikely that any Foreign Powers would challenge the issue oi‘ an Order in Council on the lines of the Bahrein Order- in Council of 1913 (although the extension of British jurisdiction, as in that order, to foreigners might involve the prior concurrence of some Foreign Powers), but that, while the High Commissioner in Iraq might be authorised to open negotiations with the Sheikh with a view to ascertaining the measure of British supervision which His Excellency was prepared to accept, the actual issue of an Order in Council consolidating any agreement that might be reached with the Sheikh should be postponed until the coming into force of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey. 26. No further action was taken until the Treaty of Lausanne had been signed and, owing to the necessity for departmental examination of the provisions of the Order, the approval of His Majesty to an Order in Council was not finally obtained until 17th March 1925. Under the Order in question jurisdiction over British subjects and protected persons, the subjects and protected persons of non-Moslem foreign Governments, and Koweit subjects or the subjects of other Moslem Governments registered in the Office of the Political Agent as being regularly employed by British subjects or subjects of non-Moslem foreign Governments, was vested in the Political Agent subject to the general control of, and a right of appeal to, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It may be noted 0 that, no' foreign Power having consented to the exercise of jurisdiction over its nationals in Koweit by His Majesty, the Political Agent was instructed, at the request of the Foreign Office, that, in the event of a national of a non- Moslem Power committing some crime or misdemeanour necessitating proceedings against him, or of such a person becoming involved in civil proceedings, the matter should at once be brought to the notice of His Majesty’s Government who, on learning that such a case had arisen, would take steps to ascertain from the Government of the person concerned whether they desired that the case should be dealt with under the Koweit Order in Council. The Order in Council came into force in the 1st October 1925,| but the concurrence of the Sheikh in the delegation of jurisdiction over the classes of person in question was not finally obtained until November I 925. J Since that date various Rules of Court and King’s Regulations have been issued under the Koweit Order in Council, but no point of importance has arisen in connection with its operation. 27. It may be recorded that, a clearer understanding as to responsibility, between the interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government, for the internal administration of Koweit having been reached by that stage, the preparation and issue of the Order in Council of 1925 were, by agreement with the Colonial Office, left to be dealt with by the India Office in conjunction with the Foreign Office. (6) The Bunder Shweikh Lease. 28. The question of terminating the lease of Bunder Shweikh, the earlier history of which is given in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908, and the engagements entered into in connection with which by His Majesty’s Government are shown in the Precis of Treaties appended to the present Memorandum, came up for consideration on the conclusion of the Mar. After considerable correspondence during 1919-20, the Government of India recommended in April 1920 that the lease should be terminated as the Sheikh had maintained a consistently obstructive attitude towards His Maiestv’s Government. Uncertainty as to the status of Koweit under the Peace Treaty and consideration of the political effect on the Sheikh of withdrawal of 'the subsidy which the rent of Bunder Shweikh in fact constituted of the possibility of bringing pressure to bear on His Excellency in other wavs and of the question of retaining the site at a reduced rent' &amp;c prevented a Tel.from h.c. to s.s. forL, ^cision before the death of Sheikh Salim in February 1921.

The High Commissioner for Iraq reported in August 1922 that this decision had been communicated to and accepted by the Sheikh. There have been no further echoes of this question since that date. It should be noted, however, that while the lease has been terminated, the Agreement does not appear to have been abrogated, and that the reciprocal pledges exchanged on its conclusion i,n 1907 presumably, therefore, remain binding in so far as they are not affected by other :subsequent instruments. Oil in Koweit. 29. In concluding the review of the more important post-war internal developments in Koweit, reference may conveniently be made to the • question of oil. The Sheikh had agreed in 1913 (see para. 10 above) not to grant an oil concession without the approval of His Majesty’s Government. Here, as in Bahrein, the question of obtaining a concession was revived by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1921, and His Majesty’s Government, who were anxious to facilitate the establishment by the Company of control •over the oil resources of the north Arabian coast, agreed to the institution of negotiations, which were conducted through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Lengthy negotiations have, however, so far proved unfruitful. (I he general question of oil in the Gulf is dealt with in the Board of Trade Memorandum on page ^.) External Questions, 1919 - 28 . (1) Relations with Ibn Saud. (a) Koweit-Nejd-Iraq Boundary Question. 30. Owing to the non-ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of :29th July 1913, the boundaries of Koweit had, as explained above, been left in suspense on the outbreak of the War. Clause 6 of the Treaty concluded with Ibn Saud on the 20th December 1915, provided that the limits of Koweit territory should thereafter be determined. The question remained in a fluid state until the end of the War. 31. In January 1919, on Sheikh Salim proposing to build a fort at Major More’s Memo. Dauhat Balbul, just north of Jabal Manila, Ibn Saud took exception, claiming R 2417 / 28 - that the site in question lay within his territory. No overt act followed, but relations on this subject became increasingly strained, customs difficulties— the Sheikh having placed an embargo on exports to Ibn Saud’s ports*— * Letter from ibn Saud to further aggravating the situation. Matters culminated in the surprise and p h 6 ? 24 / 2 o m,Jur,e21 1920 ’ defeat by Akhwan under Faisal-al-Dawish of the Koweit tribesmen, under Sheikh Dhaij, who had been sent by Sheikh Salim to contest Akhwan •occupaqcy of Jariyah, at Hamdeh, near Janyah, on the 18th April 1920, from p. 6317 / 20 . which point the friction between the Sheikh of Koweit and Ibn Saud became acute. The situation was briefly,f that the Sheikh claimed on his southern t Cp. tel. from C.C., frontier the boundaries represented by the green line in the map attached to foooX^io 1920 , f ° 1 ’ L ’ Mraft Anglo-Turkish Convention, which represented the area administered by p - 6281 / 20 .' ' his father, Sheikh Mubarak, over the whole of which, however, by August 1920 he had no longer effective control. Ibn Saud, on the other hand, claimed the southern portion of the area in question by virtue of the fact that the tribes ordinarily resident therein had since 1914 or thereabouts, been under his direct control, and not under that of Sheikh Salim or his predecessor, Sheikh Jabir. 32. During the summer of 1920, His Majesty’s Government, with a view to determining the dispute, on which they had been approached by both parties^, authorised Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner in Iraq, to -discuss the matter with Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit. Ibn Saud formally claimed§ the whole country up to the walls of Koweit, “as in the time of Colonel Pelly,” and maintained that he had no cognisance of the boundaries of Koweit agreed between us and the Turks in 1913, and that such an agreement could not in any case be operative against him, especially .as he had himself recovered the El Hasa province from Turkey before the J Tel. from P.A., Kovvelt, to H.C., Iraq, 76 C., Aug. 1&amp; 1920 (K.), P. 6924/20; tel. from C.C., Baghdad, Aug. 19 1920, to S. of S. for I., &amp;c., P, 6281/20. § Tel. from P.A., Bahrein, to Pol.

War. Sheikh Salim, on the other hand, claimed to take advantage of the- frontier agreed upon between Turkey and His Majesty’s Government, as- embodied in the draft Anglo-Turkish Convention. Sir P. Cox, having heard both sides and formed his own conclusions, recommended that a meeting should be arranged during the winter of 1920 between the principals with a view to settlement. At this stage Sheikh Salim (who, like Ibn Sand, had given an undertaking in writing to refrain from aggression pending the- settlement of the issues by the mediation of His Majesty’s Government), having failed to demobilise a considerable force which he had gathered together at Jahra, at the head of Koweit Pay, was attacked b} 7 the Akhwan and an inconclusive if bloody fight ensued (October 1920). 33. Thanks to the good offices of the High Commissioner, it proved possible to avoid further hostilities, and negotiations continued until the early part of 1921. In December 1920 Ibn Sand, who in November|| had been invited to visit Basra with a view to reaching a settlement under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government, expressed his willing ness to accept the ex parte decision of the High Commissioner, but stated that he was unable to go to Basra owing partly to ill-health, and partly to internal political difficulties. In January 1921, no settlement having yet been reached, the Sheikh of Mohammerah offered to send his son Sheikh Chasib, accompanied by Sheikh Ahmed el Jabir, nephew and heir presumptive of the Sheikh of Koweit, to Nejd^f to endeavour to arrange a truce between Ibn Sand and Sheikh Salim. His offer was accepted and the mission left for Bahrein en route for Nejd in February, reaching Ibn Sand’s camp to the north of Riyadh on the 2nd March. On the 4th March the news of the death of Sheikh Salim arrived, whereupon Ibn Sand stated that there was no longer any quarrel to settle or any need for a frontier between his territories and those of the Sheikh of Koweit-—an arrangement with which Sheikh Ahmed (whose succession was recognised by His Majesty’s Government, who renewed to him the assurances given to Sheikh Salimj'), was reported at the time to be quite satisfied. (Ibn Saud had already been informed^ before- the death of Sheikh Salim, that His Majesty’s Government recognised the territory within the inner boundary (the red circle) shown on the map attached to the Anglo-Turkish Koweit and not open to dispute). Agreement as definitely appertaining to- P. 115/23. Koweit Diary for Dec. 1-8 1922, para. 195, P. 463/23. P. 915/23. 34. No further developments took place until November 1922, when at the Conference held at Ojair from 27th November to 3rd December between Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Saud (the Political Agent, Koweit, also being present) the Koweit-Nejd frontier came up for consideration. It was recognised at once that the power of the Sheikh of Koweit in the desert was much less than it had been at the time of the conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 1913, and a settlement was finally reached under which the frontier as between Nejd and Koweit starts from the junction of the Wadi al Anjah with the Batin on the west; running thence (leaving Riqai to Nejd) in a straight line to the junction of the 29th parallel of latitude with the red semicircle on the map attached to the draft Anglo-Turkish agreement,, and reproduced in Map II appended to this Memorandum ; thence following the red semicircle to the sea south of Ras al Qulaiah. The southern boundary of the recognised territory of Koweit was defined as above. It was simultaneously agreed that the tract of country bounded on the north by the above line, on the west by the Shaqq, on the east by the sea r and on the south by a straight line running eastward from the Shaqq in the west through Ain al Abd to the sea north of Ras al Mishab, should be recognised as common to the two States of Nejd and Koweit, who were to enjoy equal rights in it until such time as a fresh agreement should be arrived at between them regarding it through the good offices of His Majesty’s Government. This frontier, which had been negotiated on behalf of the Sheikh (Major More, the Political Agent at Koweit, representing his interests), was accepted by His Excellency on the 26th January 1923. 35. In April 1923 the Sheikh was informed that His Majesty’s Government Letter from h.o., Iraq, to recognised the frontier claimed by him as between Koweit and Iraq and the p.a., Koweit, April 191923 , attribution to Koweit of the Islands of Warba, Bubiyan, Maskan, Failakah^ P. 17-5 23.“15 9 AuhaL, Kubbar, Qaru, and CJnim-ei-Maradin—in other words, the frontier indicated by the green line of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 29th July 1913. The frontiers of Koweit are accordingly as shown on Map II attached to the present Memorandum. Since 1923 no difficulty has arisen in regard to them. (b) Customs dispute between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit. 36. The difficulty is not a new one ; it dates from before the war. With the acquisition of El Hasa by Ibn Saud in 1913, Nejd acquired a sea front, but the sea front in question contained no port of any real value, and the P. 1276/24. efforts made from time to time by Ibn Saud, with the assistance at intervals of His Majesty’s Government, to secure that steamship lines such as the British Indian Steam Navigation Company should call at Ojair or at Qatif, or to develop Ojair, Qatif or Jubail, have proved abortive. In these circumstances a friendly understanding with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit on the question of customs and transit dues is of great and evident importance to the Ruler of Nejd. Agreement with Bahrein, on the basis of a transit duty of 2 per cent., was reached in 1920, after long discussion and much ill-feeling, with the assistance of the Government of India. Agreement with Koweit, which in 1923 levied a 4 per cent, duty on imports and a further 4 per cent, transit duty, has not yet been reached ; and since p - 29 '/ 23 - 1920 Ibn Saud has in consequence maintained an embargo on trade with Koweit with the result that the prosperity of the Principality, as indeed of Qasim and Hail in Nejd, has been seriously affected. 37. The position is briefly that Ibn Saud, on the ground that it is impossible to collect import duty on the desert frontier between Kuwait and Nejd, is anxious for the establishment either of a Nejdi Custom House in Koweit town, or of an arrangement under which export duty only should be collected on his behalf at Koweit, a fixed sum being paid to Nejd instead of * c p . Major More’s Memo. import duty. A third proposal, 0 made in 1923 by the Sheikh’s cousin s.v. Abduiiaii-as-Saiim. Abdullah-as-Salim, was that the embargo should be raised on terms which would have involved the payment to Ibu Saud, through, an Agent and Collector stationed in Koweit (Abdullah-as-Salim himself), of the whole of the customs dues on goods exported from Koweit by land other than those + june-Juiy 192a destined for the Sheikh’s own subjects or for Iraq.*)' p.3476/23.' 38. The objection of the Sheikh of Koweit to an agreement on the lines referred to above would appear to be due as much to the fear of allowing Ibn Saud to establish a stranglehold over Koweit as to anxiety to secure an * arrangement which shall not be economically unsatisfactory from his own point of view. An arrangement which would enable Ibn Saud to collect his own dues in Koweit would, as the Government of India pointed out in December 1923, appear primd facie to contravene both Ibn Sand’s engagements to His Majesty’s Government, and those into which His Majesty’s Government have themselves entered with Koweit ; while the extension in Koweit of the influence of the King of the Hejaz and Nejd would in any event be objectionable—-the engagements to Koweit of His Majesty’s Government apart —on general political grounds. 39. There has been no development of importance in recent years, though the position cannot be satisfactory from the point of view of either Koweit or Nejd. A settlement which would be fair to both parties and unobjectionable from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government could best be reached on the lines suggested in July 1923 by the then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, which were accepted at the time by the Colonial Office and the India Office. Colonel Knox’s recommendation was that steps should be taken to obtain the agreement of Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit, firstly to the appointment of a Customs expert, preferably from India, to advise on the reform of the Koweit Customs, and on the shares of the Customs revenue to be apportioned to Nejd and Koweit respectively, and, second^, to the appointment for five years of an official to serve under the control of the Political Agent and carry out the recommendations made by the Adviser. But in February 1924 the Political Resident reported that, proposals on c.o.ietter to 1.0., 35969/23, these lines having been put to the interested parties, “neither Ibn Saud nor Aug. s 1923, p. 2999/23. 2979c B■ P. 1004/24.

Res. to C.O. Aug. 5 1928, P. 4423. The Akhwan Menace. 40. Akhwan raids on Koweit had taken place in 1924 and 1925,J but on an inconsiderable scale. The Akhwan raids on Iraq by Feisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the Principality.§ At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty s Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory ; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions origin all v imposed by H^s Majesty’s Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Riqai on 27th January 1928,|| and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again successfully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty’s Govern ment under existing engagements for the “protection of Koweit” (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument^), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive, cp. para. 47 below), was established in Koweit: \i flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its protection : three vessels of the Persian Gulf squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India agreed that His Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been despatched to Koweit were withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars.' ::: ' :;: ‘ 41. Consequent on the breakdown of the negotiations with Ibn Sand in the summer of 1928. and the possible danger of a revival of Akhwan activity on the Iraq-Nejd border, the question of granting discretion to the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, to carry out reconnaissances by air or car over Koweit territory was raised by the Air Ministry. 42. The “ very obvious and grave political objection ” to air recon naissance over Koweit was emphasised by Sir Gilbert Clayton. After considerable discussion between the Departments concerned, the Air Officer Commanding was finally authorised to carry out occasional reconnaissances both by air and car, at his discretion, on the understanding that the concurrence of the Sheikh should be obtained, through the Political Resident ; that reconnaissance should be carried out as infrequently and in as unprovocative a manner as possible; that the Sheikh should be given “no grounds for supposing that the Royal Air Force have assumed responsibilify for the defence of Koweit or that he himself has been relieved of his obligations in this respect ”; that save in qase of real emergency reconnaissance should not be carried out within 25 miles of the Nejd-Koweit frontier nor in the immediate vicinity of the Nejd-Iraq15 11 frontier in the neighbourhood of the neutral zone ; and that the authority given^ should operate only for the period of the present emergency. The question of the establishment of an advance air base in the event of a raid was reserved for further consideration if and when the need arose. e (2) Relations with Iraq. (1) Question of exemption from taxation of date gardens in Iraq of the Sheikh of Koweit. 0 J ^ s soen from para. 12 above, one of the guarantees given on •bid No\ember 1914 to the Sheikh of Ivoweit was that his “date gardens on the Fuikish side of the Shatt-el-Arab should remain in full possession of you and your heirs and immune from taxation.” 44. At the time when the Financial Agreement, arising out of Article 15 °r rr ^ n ^ 1(&gt;I r a &gt;L Treat y IfAb October 1922, was under the consideration or His Majesty s Government, it was proposed that a provision to safeguard the mu • ^ the Sheikh under the guarantee referred to above should be inserted, Ihis proposal was subsequently abandoned, an ' the High Commissioner was instructed in November 1923 to treat this ooligation separately under Article 10 of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty. Owing to an oversight, the point was omitted. when the exchange of Notes defining the obligations of Iraq and His Majesty s Government under Article 10 of the Treaty took place; and on the matter coming to notice some other method of safeguarding the rights of the Sheikh under the guarantee in question had to be devised, .he Iiaq Goveinment, on being approached, expressed the opinion that the immunity m question could not properly be continued in the circumstances without the_ authority of a special law, and that, if special legislation were intioduced, it would be rejected by the Iraq Parliament. They stated that they were, in the circumstances, unwilling to take the responsibility of intioducing such legislation, and desired that the matter should be referred to His Majesty’s Government. 45. I he foreign Office, Colonial Office and India Office agreed that there was no ground on which His Majesty’s Government could justify the discontinuance of the immunity from taxation hitherto accorded to the Sheikh of Koweit, as to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. After considerable discussion it was, however, decided that it was undesirable to give prominence to the question by the insertion in the revised Financial Agreement of a provision to cover it if any other method of safeguarding the position be found; and that this might be regarded as having been attained if the Iraq Government accepted the reference in the Memorandum accompanying Article 3 of the revised Treaty between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq (which provided foi the lecognition by the Iraq Government of British international obligations in respect of Iraq) to the immunity from taxation of the date gardens of the Sheikhs of Kow r eit and Mohammerah as one of the international obligations in question. No objection having been raised to the inclusion of the undertaking m question bv the Iraq delegates, His Majesty s Government in January 1928 placed on record their assumption that the Iraq Government w r ere now prepared to recognise those undertakings as part of the international obligations which His Britannic Majesty had undertaken to see carried out in respect of Iraq, and to recognise that they had inherited the duty of ensuring that those undertakings w r ere fully discharged. The High Commissioner was instructed to inform the Iraq Government accordingly, and to endeavour to induce them to agree to continue to afford to the two Sheikhs in question immunity from taxation in respect of their date gardens in Iraq. His Majesty’s Government added that, should the Iraq Government, while prepared to honour those under takings, feel doubtful of their ability to persuade the Iraq Parliament to pass the necessary legislation, it would be for consideration wdiether King Feisal should not be requested to pass an Ordinance in. accordance with Article 26 (3) of the Iraq Constitution to give effect to them, His Majesty’s Goveinment, taking the view that their fulfilment might be regarded as a treaty obligation on the part of Iraq which the Government of that country might be called upon to fulfil under Article 4 of the Treaty of 10th October 2979c P See P. 4537/27.

No information is available as to any subsequent developments. (2) Position of Koweit vis-d-vis Iraq. 4b. Under the engagement of 1914 between Ilis Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh of Koweit, the Principality of Koweit is recognised as an independent Principality and as entitled to the protection of His Majesty’s Government, by whom, as stated in para. 35 above, the present Koweit-lraq boundary was recognised in 1923. Formally, therefore, there is no question of its absorption by Iraq. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has, however, recently drawn attention (as the result of an incident in which an Iraq officer was alleged to have despatched an Iraq police inspector to Koweit to arrest and bring back an offender from there) to the danger of Koweit and Iraq becoming, in the minds of the native community, unified under British protection. Sir Lionel Haworth remarked''' that “ it must be an essential part of our policy that Koweit should be kept apart from Iraq—it is inevitable that it should be the tendency of Iraq gradually to assimilate Koweit even if there is no conscious knowledge of the fact among the officials of the Iraq Government. Such tendencies result, not from direct action, but from psychological factors, from the dependence of the Sheikh of Koweit upon Iraq for assistance, from the appointment of Iraq officers to Koweit during the raids, and from the common interests of people, alike in race and religion, depending upon the same market centres and in constant daily communication. It is, indeed, perhaps the natural development that Koweit should draw close to Iraq while we are there, but we do not desire her to get so close that, with the development of time, she would be left there when we leave in spite of our wishes . . . It is for us to see . . . that such help as Koweit may require may be obtained from assistance from our Navy and the training of her people—and it would be better that such training should be given from India and not from Iraq. Koweit should be trained to look to His Majesty’s Government and India alone and not to a country under our Mandate.” 47. The Political Resident had earlier in 192S urged the undesirability from the point of view alike of the immediate situation and of our future policy of linking Iraq and Koweit in the mind of Ibn Sand by establishing an air base against Akhwan raiders in Koweit territory. He reiterated his objections in connection with the proposals dealt with in paras. 40 and 41 above. On both occasions the Government of India expressed their general agreement in the view taken by him. (3) Relations with Persia. 48. No question affecting the relations between Koweit and Persia appears to have arisen in the period now under consideration, and it would be unnecessary to refer to the relationship between the two countries were it not for the information which has recently been received that a Persian instruction has been issued to the local Persian officials in the Gulf that the Persian Government can recognise no Arab rulers on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and that all persons belonging to and arriving from Koweit (as from Muscat, Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhdoms) are to be considered Persian subjects, and Persian passports to be issued to them. 49. It is impossible at the present stage to estimate the importance to be attached to the information quoted above. It may, however, be placed on record that no evidence has been traced of effective exercise in the past of Persian authority in Koweit. The two incidents on which a Persian claim might possibly be based are—first, that Koweit was regarded in 1775 as a dependency of Basra, and that a claim might therefore be put forward in view of the fact that Persia had occupied that town from 1775 to 1779, even though Persian authority does not appear in the same period to have extended to Koweit. The second and more important incident is that of 1899. In Lor. i, 1025.13 'October of that year it was ascertained that the Sheikh of Koweit had undoubtedly applied through the Sheikh of Mohammerah to be taken under Persian protection. Mr. Lorimer suggests that this move, which the Sheikh, it is stated, took no pains to conceal, was perhaps contrived by His Excellency merely with a view to testing the degree of interest taken in Koweit by His Majesty s Government. The Sheikh’s advances were, however, in any case rejected by the Shah. C.—Summary. 50. In conclusion, it may be remarked that, while the present Sheikh is far from an outstanding personality, internal conditions in Koweit at the present time show a marked improvement on the position on the death of Sheikh Salim in 1921. In August 1920f local feeling was reported to be running high against Sheikh Salim, owing to the loss of trade resulting from his quarrel with Ibn Saud, to his general incapacity as a ruler and to his total lack of tact, and it would appear that a coup d'etat was more than a possibilityJ had not the Sheikh died at a critical period of the Koweit-Nejd boundary negotiations on 23rd February 1921. Under the present Sheikh, while the customs dispute with Nejd remains an open sore and the activity of the Akhwan a standing menace, matters may on the whole, be said quite definitely to have improved. The boundary question has been settled and •on a basis not unsatisfactory from the point of view of Koweit; the question of British jurisdiction within the Principality has equally been regularised ; internal conditions are not such as to call for serious animadversion and, while the Sheikh, as stated above, is not an outstanding personality, he is not only well disposed towards His Majesty’s Government but, from the point of view of internal administration, may be regarded as a not inefficient ruler when judged by Arab standards. 51. On a broad view, the importance of Koweit is less great from the standpoint of His Majesty’s Government than that of Bahrein or of Muscat; but its absorption, or the establishment in it of a dominating influence, by Ibn Saud, could not but react injuriously on the position of His Majesty’s ‘Government alike in Iraq and in Bahrein and along the Trucial Coast. Hitherto it has been possible to maintain British influence without substantial interference in the internal affairs of the Principality ; the recent activities of the Akhwan have led to formal appeals by the Sheikh to the guarantees of protection which he holds from His Majesty’s Government, and it is to be hoped that the standing threat to his independence constituted by his powerful neighbour in Nejd and the effective assistance given him against the Akhwan during the present year may help to continue to keep him generally amenable to British influence. The desirability, at the same time, of securing that the Sheikh shall not escape absorption by Ibn Saud only to end by absorption in an Iraq, no longer under British mandate, and the increased importance which his Principality, situated at the head of the Gulf, will assume as British control decreases in Iraq, cannot be overlooked in considering the general policy to be adopted in the Principality by His Majesty’s Government. D.—Points referred to Persian G-ulf Sub-Committee. 52. The points in connection with Koweit which have been specifically mentioned in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub- Oommittee are (a) Whether the maintenance of the independence of Koweit (as of Muscat and the Trucial Chiefs) which is constantly threatened by Ibn Saud, is necessary for British purposes, and, if so, how is it to be secured ? (P.G. 3 viii, P.G. G (2) c. i.) (b) The position as between Iraq and Koweit—desirability of keeping Koweit clear from absorption in Iraq, or from coming under Iraq influence. (P.G. 6, 2 (6) (3).) (c) Extent to which His Majesty’s Government should increase or decrease the interest taken and the control exercised by them in Koweit.

In this connection the Government of India have expressed the view that the maintenance of the independence of Koweit (as of Muscat, Bahrein, and the Trucial Chiefs) is necessary in British interests ; that the veiled protectorate at present exercised over them by His Majesty’s Government suffices against European encroachments; that so long as we do not alienate Arab opinion by attempting undue westernisation it suffices also against encroachments by Wahabi State, and that if need be, it can be more explicitly asserted.
