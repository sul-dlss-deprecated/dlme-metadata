OOHHl'lHTiAl (ifcGWi Sir, V V ..ith reference to your -rinted Jonfidential Letter No.G/211, dated the 15th 1-ay 1934 and enclosures, I have the honour to enclose translation of (a) Letter i:o.R4/l511, dated the 19th I .ay from H.E. the Shaikh of ilu^Tai t to myself, together with enclosure; (b) Translation of an article i;o.42, which appeared in the Iraq newspaper the 'Saut al Ahali' (Voice of the people) under date 7th llay 1934. 2. I would ask on behalf of H.3. the Shaikh that further representations be made if possible to the Iraq G-overninent with a view to trying to get these unpleasant^ attacks definitely stopoed. 3. From our Western point of view it might be argued that such attacks thou^i in 'bad form' are in the nature of honest criticism and do little harm. The difference however is that we are dealing with the Jast, and an Arab Ruler in close relations of friendship with us. Hot only should we, I think, try and take all steps to keep his fair name from being besmudged, but we should realize that such attacks hurt deeply, where to a Westerner they would perhaps cause amusement. 4. I would ask what the feo.V-ngs of a J J„ decent people in Iraq would be, were a Kuwaio newspaper to publish/-- 2 - publish articles of the same nature against E.M. the King of Iraq, and the methods he employs in the management of his private estates. 5. In the present case the Piaster bandit' referred to is the shaikh*s land Agent at Fao, who at one time was bailiff to the shaikh of i^ohaiomerah. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lt.-Colonel, Political ^gent, Kuwait.Translation of a letter I.o ,-14 /1511, dated the 5th 3afar 1355, equivalent to the 19th Lay 19 34, from His Jxcellency the -iuler of Kuwait to the lolitical Agent, Kuwait. Af ter 'J omplime nt s, I beg to enclose herewith a copy of the Iraqi newspaper: TT Al Ahali', and to draw your attention to the false statements set out therein, and which are alleged to exist as a result of our treatment of the Fellaheen of our Date G-ardens. I feel sure that inventions of this nature will be condemned by everyone of understanding, who is cognizant of our fair treatment, sympathetic and benevolent intentions in the matter of the welfare of our properties and Fellaheen equally, I beg, therefore, to request that you will refer this unfavourable libel to the authorities concerned, so as to prevent the publication of such falsehoods which only disturb and acerbate feelings.

P . ^ ^ We have new ofrtainea the original Archie text of the Convention t rorn the Colonial Oil ice and it aas loeen examined by our iirahic experts here. I enclose a copy of a note hy tne Assistant Librarian&gt; of my letter to Dickson, ana of Dickson's reply. The Assistant Librarian informs me that Dickson's suggestion that the word ''gal' 11 is more probably a mistake for the word 'jal 11 is unlikely to be correct, and that it is most improbable that a local or colloquial wora such as 15 Jal' would be used in the Arabic version of the treaty document, which is written/ Mendel, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Office, 3.1V. 1.- 4 - IV written in the classical language. On the other hand, it appears that the assistant Librarian's om suggestion that the error may he the employment of Mai'' for 11 ^11'' is, for the reasons given hy Dickson, equally untenable. 3. Kj^The true explanation is prohahly that given in paragraph 8 of Dickson's letter of 1st October, hut I doubt whether we are likely profitably to be able to pursue the matter much further at tnis sta^e. As the error is in the text and not in the translation it could not be modified without aiscussion with the 3auaiS; which might be difficult; tnanks to the corresponaence we are now on our guara as to the possibility of any . encroachment on the Neutral Zone by Ion 3aud such as is referrea to in paragraph 7^f'1Dickson , s letter of 1st October; and we shall know where we stand if formal discussion of the amendment of the Arab Text proves necessary at a later date. Would you let me know if you agree? 4, I am sending copies of this letter and its enclosures to Bushire, Koweit ana the Government of India.

As it stands, the vvora 'dal 4 ' can only mean 'a low mountainous range 11 ? ana that this is a very unlikely description oi 'one feature is shown by the iaclj that tne proper naiLe given to it, (al-^iaciQ or Esh-.3hak.k), literally means 'gap' or 'trench 11 . But if I may he permitted to suggest an emendation in the i.rahic text, I think that it is highly prohahle that '•dal'' is a mistake lor 'til''; this latter word bears tne meaning '-a depressed piece of ground, having in it a nill from which it is possible to see all round'.

OctolDer 1st 1934. ¥jy dear Laithwaite, Will you kinaly refer to your note to me of 27th September 1934, re^araing the question oi the error in the description in the Kuwait Neutral Zone Convention of 1922, of the Western Boundary of the Kuwait Neutral Zone» &lt;0 o With all aue deference to the assistant Lihrarian, I ao not tnink tnat tne Arabic word 'aal' ' is a mistake for 'til' ' , which he describes as meaning 'a depressed piece of ground having in it a hill from which it is possible to see all rouna'. It is much more likely, in my view, to be a mistake for the commonly used Bedouin word 'jal', which is used extensively in Nejd, Hassa, and Kuwait for a long low ridge, (for example, Jal al Liyah, Jal al Zor, which are to be found north of the Bay of Kuwait ana on the road to Basra from Jahara). The word 'til' or 'tel' undoubtedly means a small hill, usually of conical shape, in Arabic, but although it is extensively used in Palestine, Syria and Iraq is certainly not used in Kuwait or Nejd, as far as 1 know. There the commonly accepted word to denote such a feature as a small hillock, cone shaped, is 'thalaat' or 'thalaiyat' its diminutive, (examples Ihalaat al Dhaba, Thalaiat as Sur, both well known hills S.W. of Kuwait and west of the Neutral Zone respectively). The Bedouin also use the term ''Idairat' for a small pud-k rising out of a ridge (example 1 Idairat al Hussin, I^cxiro.t al Hamdth), but I do not think we need bother our heads about this latter. 4/7/ o - &lt;0 - n 4. One thing is pretty certain, in Bedouin Arabia a whole host of terms are used for natural features such as dry water courses, hills, depressions, flat open spaces without vegetation, pehhly ground, rocky ground, etc., etc., which are either not found in dictionaries, or have heen so mutilated as not to he recogniaahle with their counterpart in the dictionary. A man like philhy who is an Arabic scholar coula probably say how and from what classical Arabic word these Bedouin expressions have oeen arrived at, buu 1 am airaid niy Knowledge does not go as far. 5. To return to our subject. As the ^rabic text says that the 7/estern Boundary of tne Neutral Zone is ,4 a low mountainous ridge called shaq (al Shaqq)', there clearly is an error somewhere, for as 1 explained personally to you, the shaq is a wide shallow depression anything from 2 to 5 miles across according to location, with not a vestige of a hill or rise in its bed, through out its whole length - indeed it is so shallow throughout most of its length that in many parts of it the untrained eye cannot detect where tne western side begins and ends. 09 It is true that a series of low ridges and isolated hillocks run down the Eastern side of the shaq as far as the Neutral Zone is concerndd (as per sketch below) out as these lie generally speaking anything from 4 to o miles away, and as they bear other names such as u Jebel Fuwaris', '^rhaiya', etc., etc., one cannot claim that they have anything to do with the 'shaq' 1 depression proper..7. One thing is quite clear to us in Kuwait, from the Sheikh downwards - the centre line of the 'shaq 1 ' is understood to he the Western boundary of the Kuwait Neutral Zone, ana I helieve Bin Saua ana his people recognise this also, ana the only reason why I originally drew the Political Resident's attention to the curious mistake in the text of trie Kuwait Boundary Convention of 1922 was that, as it stooa, it offered an opportunity to Bin Saud of possibly some day attempting to encroach on the Neutral Zone from the west hy laying claim to the strip of country lying Dctween the xCastern ea &amp; e of the Shaq and the series of low ridges lying 4 to 5 miles to the East of it. Such a claim would appeal greatly to the Nejdi mind. I personally think the mistake originally was due to tne fact that Englishmen or an Englishman (prohahly Colonel tore) drafted the original Boundary Convention in English, without having any personal knowledge of the ground, ana guidea hy tne million sheet map of Arabia only, ana it was then translated into Arabic for the approval ana signature of the negotiators of the Convention. It would be quite easy for a person not knowing the ground ana looking at the map to think that the 3haq was a low hill. In fact I na^e known more uhan three englishmen who have made the same mistake when reading the map. The latter is by no means as clear as it ought to be. 9 ' Apologising for this lengthy note, Yours sincerely, H.ii.p. DICKSON.stj s ^ v s -r' n p♦Z.6295/34.

Shaikh of Kuwait has complained that without ciny warning some Iraqi Tax gatherers in uniform have just been collecting taxes on animals belonging to Iraqi tribesmen at present grazing in Kuwait territory. Tax gatherers actually entered Kuwait torn to replenish food stuff supplies. Shaikh points out that his own tax gatherers were refused permission to enter Iraq territory to collect similar tax on Kuwaiti tribesmen and very properly did not cross frontier. 2.

After Compliments, I beg to inform you that during the tax collecting season last year some of our officials proceeded to collect the n Zakat tt tax from some of our tribesmen, who were camped just inside the territory of Iraq. rthen they reached Safwan, (1 mile over the border) they quite properly gave up their intention as they were told they could not collect taxes in Iraq territory by 1iie officer there. They accordingly returned to Kuwait out of consideration for the frontiers of our twin Government of the Iraq. 2. Now, however, we note a very contrary behaviour from officials of the Iraq Government. It has cane to our notice that the Mudir of the Hartha Nahiya (North of Basra) Daud as Salman, by name, with 2 Policemen in uniform and assisted by 2 merchants from Zubair, recently entered Kuwait territory and have been wandering round among the Muntafik shepherd tribes in a car for the purpose of collecting Koda tax. The news of the party* s activities have also been confirmed from other sources. 3. Furthermore the abovementioned official actually visited Kuwait Town on the evening of Wednesday last, 6th March 1935, with the persons and policemen mentioned above. Their object in coming in to Kuwait was to renew food supplies. This action of the above officials we do not consider suitable, seeing that it is an infringement of good relations. For this reason I ask you to refer the matter to Higher Authority, lest the question grows into a bigger one. I am anxious to prevent misunderstandings.

When Mr. KurfeyRetired. 1st Manager of the Ottoman Bank)came to Kuwait on 2nd March, he quite rightly called on me and asked if he could look round Kuwait and see the Shaikh and various merchants, with a view to his principa^i: deeiiing whether it was worth while thinking seriously of opening a branch of the Ottoman Bank at a later date# (Mr# Hammond and Mr. Pickering of the Imperial Batik of Persia and Eastern Bank respectively had already done this). 3. I told him, I saw no objection, provided he recognized that the last word always lay with His Majesty's Govemmait. 4. The Shaikh was out in the desert hunting when Mr.Kurkgy arrived, so the latter could do nothing# 5# As Mr. Kurkgy did not know when the Shaikh irould return he wrote2 he wrote him a letter dated 4oS.1935 and left again for Basra without seeing the Shaikh. A few days after, the Shaikh explained in conversation with me, that the Ottoman Bank Directorate in Basra had ai qui red from him (through a certain Mr. Kurkgy) about the possibilities of opening a Bank at some future date in Kuwait. That he (the Shaikh) had written and told Mr. KuiKfey, that he thought that the bank would find it quite worth their while to do so, and that he had explained that should the bank enentually decide to open in Kuwait, he (the Shaikh) would be willing to promise ttoit no other bank should compete with it for 10 to 15 years. This seemed to me harmless, and quite business like on the part of the Shaikh, so I did not think it worth EktibE mentioning anything to you until I saw a further advance on the part of the baik. 6. You will notice that on Mr. Kurkgy^ return to Basra, the Official Manager of the Bank addressed his letter of 9th April 1935 to the Shaikh and sent copy to me under his letter of sane date.

On your Express Letter No. 356-S of 30tll^April reaching me yesterday I saw the Shaikh and asked if he would let me have a copy of his letter dated 6th March to Mr. Kurkgy and he readily agreed to do so. He quite frankly said that he had nothing to hide at all and that all he tad told the gentleman was that he wculd be very pleased to see his bank open provided his principals came forward in due course and proposed terms. Should he agree to these and should the bank agree to certain conditions he himself would put forward, then all would be well. 8. The Shaikh emphasized that the road was open still for anyfor aay number of banks to ask him for a monopoly in Kuwait • 9, I may mention in passing that the Shaikh always keeps his private money with the Ottoman Bank Basra, and is on the bGst of terms with them^ He has an account witii the Eastern Bank also. The managers of both banks fairly often come to Kuwait and stay wilii the Shaikh as his guests, 10, I enclose a translation of the Shaikh's letter with this. 11, X myself do not see that the Shaikh has conmitted any particular indiscretion so far. - • * Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait.IRillSLciTIOH: fl of letter No.R-4/l9 54.

It is naturally my hope that any dealings between us now or for the future will be carried through to our mutual satisfaction. Should your principals Gome to a final and definite decision about a bank here^ and decide to open, before overtures are actually nade to me by other banks, then I shall be prepared as proposed by you, to allow no other bank to open in Kuwait for a period of 10 or 15 years/- E - qo years from the date of tiie opening of your branoli.

'Proposed establishment of branch of Imperial Bank of Persia at Kuwait. ,, Sir, IA :h ref a With reference to your Confidential Printed Letter No. 355-^ dated the 30th April 1935 and enclosures, I have the honour to say in reply that there are to my mind certain definite objections to the Imperial Bank of Persia applying for pemission to open a branch in Kuwai t,seeing that everyone knows that the concern has large connections and ramifications in Per si a, and has in the past been closely mixed up with the Persian Government itself. 2. The only other competetor in the field is the Ottoman Bank, but they do not appear to have quite definitely come forward yet. 3* As for the Eastern Bank, I think we can rule them out of the picture, for althou^i Mr. Wilson, their Branch Manager in Basra sounded me on the subject at the end of January last, and got so far as to say he would come down and see me in February, he in a subsequent letter informed me that his London Principals had definitelyZ W definitely abandoned for the present tiie idea of a Bank in Kuwait (vide also paragraphs 21 and 29 of Kuwait Intelligence Summary for 1935)• I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait.(T, si - ' /I m-* j ■ By Air :- , ai l- p.Z.sigc/SST f INDIA OFFICE, T^KITEHALL, S.W.I- 17th May 1935. pi The Hon'ble - -*-» -fv^Le^ Would you please rei^r to Laithwaite's letter of 18th March, Ho.

I now enclose a copy of a letter from the Ottoman Bank which shows that the latter desire to open an office at Koweit, and says that the Sheikh has promised his support and stated that, in view of the initial expenses involved in starting such an office, he would not allow any other bank to open a branch there for a period of some years. 2. We shall be glad to receive your views on this proposal together with your observations on the similar proposal already referred to you. 3. There is presumably not at present enough &lt;, business/ Lt.Col.T.C.R.Fowle,C.B.E. , ^ •/o The Political Agent, T.', Bahrein. ^ J,' ulcM 2. 'business for more than one Bank at Koweit. It may be that the Ottoman Bank, not being, like the Imperial Bank, dependent on Persian business, are perhaps to be preferred to the latter at Koweit. On the other hand, the Ottoman Bank are not a British Bank but a Franco- British concern. It is possible, however, that the Bank might be willing to employ only British personnel at Koweit, and to give an assurance to this effect. Are there any other points on which you think that we should arrive at a prior understanding if our answer to the Ottoman Bank is that we see no objection to the proposal to establish an office at Koweit ? An extract from the 'Statist' is enclosed, which gives a general idea of the organisation of the Bank.Extract from 'The Statist' dated Saturday, November 17th 1934. OTTOMAIT BAITK. Chief Office : Istanbul, Turkey. London Office: 26, Throgmorton Street, E.G.2. Capital - Authorised and issued £10,000,000 in 500,000 shares of £20; Paid up, £5,000,000 - £10 per share. This bank was established in 1863 to act as central bank in Turkey, a right recently withdrawn in favour of a new central bank, which began operations on October 3, 1931. The Ottoman Bank's headquarters are at Istanbul and there are agencies at London and Paris. Besides offices in these centres and at Manchester, Marseilles, and Nice, the bank has about 65 offices covering Turkey, Cyprus, Egypt, Greek Macedonia, Palestine, Transjordania, Iraq and Persia. In 1925 the bank established an Agricultural Bank in Cyprus. In addition the bank has an interest in Syria and the Lebanon, through an affiliated institution, the Banque de Syrie et du Gran Liban; in Yugoslavia, through the Banque Franco-Serbe; and, in Rumania, through the Bank of Rumania. The influx into Greece of a population from Asia Minor which had already formed part of the bank's clientele led to the establishment at Athens of an affiliated institution under the title of the British- French Discount Bank. Despite its close association with Turkey and the Turkish Government, the Bank has always been a Franco- British concern; control is exercised by a Direction ^-en^rale at Istanbul and by a General Ccmmittee with separate sections for Paris and London. By/tame- i) By a convention signed on June 5,1933, and subsequently ratified, the concession of the Bank in Turkey has been prolonged up to LJarch, 1952. Notes issuedby the bank prior to August 1914 - when the privilege of note issue ceased to be utilised - retained under the convention their character of legal tender. The bank was given the right, subject to certain conditions, to reduce the number of its agencies in Turkey from 46 to 30 and was allowed to retain certain fiscal privileges in Turkey while paying, under the same conditions as the national banks, the tax on profits realised in that country; in future the Dank was to enjoy the same advantages and the same protection as the national banks. In return for these and other privileges the bank undertook to open to the Turkish Treasury a statutory credit in current account of £1,250,000 and a temporary credit of the same amount (against Turkish pounds as security), the latter to be deposited with the newly-fonned central bank of the Republic for so long as the Ottoman Bank finds such deposit convenient. In the balance sheet as at the end of 1932 current account deposits were shown to have reverted to a more normal figure as a result of the handing over to the central bank of the Republic of the funds held by the bank for the exchange consortium, which was dissolved as soon as the central bank started its activities. This operation was reflected also in a reduction in the cash holdings of the Ottoman Bank, whose financial position however remains strong. The/ti* The pursuance of cl policy of extreme liquidity • to which the 'bank largely owed its ability to maintain its capital and reserve intact throughout the world depression-was continued last year. Improved conditions were experienced in Turkey and certain other countries within the bank^s sphere of operations, and the directors were able to report a small improvement in earnings, which had fallen progressively over the previous five years - partly, of course, because of the emphasis placed on the maintenance of a high degree of liquidity.Before you left Kuwait, 29th May^ on your last visit, you asked me to put the follcwing two questions to the Shaikh verbally, and to report his reply by means of a demi official letter. Question (a) Did he (the ohaikh) consider that he was bound to give the Ottoman Bank a monopoly, provided they agreed to his conditions, question (b) If so, why did he not consult you, before writing to I.Ir. Kurkgy the letter he did. 2 # I now write to say that I discussed the point with Shaikh Ahmad on 8th June last with the following result.- (i) In answer to question (a) the Bhaikh replied with a very decided negative. His-letter to the Bank he said, merely meant to convey that in the event of their deciding to come forward and make a firm propo sal to open a bank in Kuwait - then he was prepared to agree to open negotiations with them just in the same way as if they were an oil concern out for a concession; That he would then put forward his own terms which would include such varied matters as:- (a) Amount of Royalty or subsidy they should pay him. (b) Question of interest to be charged to him and the The Hon 1 ble Lieut-Colonel -.C.w. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, , U S H I R S.and the public. (c) Question of commission to be charged on remittances to him and to public, (d) Question of misbehaviour of Bank employees and how this would be dealt with. (e) Question of 'Hawalas' etc. etc. and then in the event of their being able to agree with his terms, and he in the meantime had not changed his mind in favour of another Bank , that he would be willing to grant the Ottoman Bank a working monopoly for 10 to 15 years. (ii) The Shaikh further said that he was quite prepared to give an exactly similar letter to the one he wrote to Mr. Kurkgy,(a retired official of the Ottoman Bank Basra J to any other Bank whatsoever, who thought fit to approach him on the subject of opening a branch in Kuwait, and that the road was entirely open to the Eastern Bank, Imperial Bank of Persia, or any other English Bank such as Lloyds Bank to come forward and see him about the matter. (iii) Lastly, that as he was anxious to see a Bank open in Kuwait at all costs now that the K.O.C. was in being, he trusted that if you or H,M # Govern ment had any other bank in mind which you wanted to assist, or preferred to the Ottoman Bank for Political reasons, you would treat the matter as an urgent one and get such bank or banks to come forward with all speed to talk business with him. The necessity of speed was of importance to him, as he could not wait too long on the convenience of other aspirants to the concession. As regards your question (b) para 1 above - the Shaikh quite frankly said that, as he was not bound by any treatytreaty or undertaking that he was aware of to consult H«M. Government in the matter of a bank, it had never occured to him to discuss this particular matter with me, before writing his perfectly normal and friendly letter to Mr. Kurkgy. But that out of personal regard for me, and wishing to convey to me that his views on Banks generally had today become quite 'modern', he had mentioned what he had done, a day or two after writing to Mr. Kurkgy. It should not be forgotten, he said, that until a short time ago Banks were anathema to Moslems like himself and his people, and one of his ideas in telling me of what he had done was to convey the fact that Kuwait was going right ahead, and that the days were gone, when -arab States moved in 'blinkers', and their rulers were thought incap able of thinking for themselves, or forming sound judge ments. 4. The Shaikh* s last words to me were 'Please tell my friend Colonel Fowle that if he wants another Bank to get in before the Ottoman Bank does then for Heavens sake to get busy and persuade it (or them) to come forward and talk business quickly, for I cannot wait for them to see if oil is found in Kuwait or not before they decide'. 5. i fear I have written a rather long letter, but I mnted to make the Shaikh's reply and his point of view generally, clear. I feel quite certain from the very candid and friendly way in which he discussed the subject, that there was no intention whatsoever of trying to gKi go behind the back of, or upset H.M. Government. He is very proud of the way he rules his State and consider that there are cerjfain things which, as an independent Suler (even though under our protection) he has a right to do without consulting us, obviously this question of a Bank4 Bank is one of them. He was quite concerned to think that you had put a different construction on the matter to what he did, and could do no more than say, that the more banks that come along, and offered to open in Kuwait, the better he would be pleased, but that he must clearly reserve the right to make final selection, in consultation with us of course, as naturally the Bank that went out to meet his terms in the friendliest and most acconmodating spirit would be accepted.s^h V Telegram R.27. ^rom Secretary of State lot India, London, To Political Resident, 3ushire.

Haji Shimlan explained that he did not like to send the letter through the ordinary post, as he believed that no letters were allowed to reach the Shaikh of Mohanmerah from the Persian Gulf region, but that if it came through the British Legation to the Ministry of Interior and in open envelope, it would reach its destination. 4.■•S— ' n 4. The letter (of which I enclose English translation) is, as you will see, quite harmless, and merely complains to the Ex-Shaikh that his Agent in Basra, K.B. Mirza Mohamed Khan, has been filing a suit in the Basra Courts against him (Haji Shimlatt) for non-payment of as 4000/- the balance of an old debt, most of which he has long since settled - That he does not deny the debt but that for old friendship's sake he wants to be given a further period of time in which to settle it, owing to the absolute failure of the Pearl trade - To this end he requests the Ex-Shaikh to instruct his agent to withdraw the suit etc. etc. If you see no objection to doing so, I should be most grateful if you could pass the worthy Haji Shmalan's letter on to His Majesty^ Minister,in your official Bag and ask him as a personal favour to do the needful - and through the proper channel of course.

I asked him to wait, but he did not agree. He filed a suit against me at the •Iraqi Courts. This surprized me, indeed, because you know as well as myself what affectionate relations and bonds of good friendship exist between us. I always thought of you as my refuge in time of need.

Maqbul Hussain has nov; sent me the enclosed letter which you may find interesting, as instancing the terrific amount of propaganda against Kuwait which the Iraq considers right to dessimate among her nationals, by means of the obedient Baghdad press. 3. I have myself an several occasions told Fowle of the deadly purport of this newspaper campaign which has been going on steadily for quite a considerable time and moves hand in hand with the Iraq Government's official pressure against Kuwait which they bring to bear in London, but I do not think i'owle ever quite realized how formidable and perfectly organized this local propaganda business was. 4./ The Hon T ble Lt.-Colonel G.Loch, I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIHE.2 (3 4. Nearly all the Iraq newspapers are received here and are read with avidity, so perhaps we are rather in peculiarly strong position to know what is going on. 5, Maqbul Hussain's statement that the belief was also prevalent in Iraq, that His Majesty^ Government were behind! the Euphrates troubles, is significant, though not news to me. Clearly only the highest officials in the land could successfully have put such a story about. These in typical fashion, while invoking His n-iajesty* s Governments aid against a wicked Kuwait with one hand, are not beneath spreading slanderous stories against His Majesty^ Government with the other. 6.

I visited the shrines in Kerb ell, in the f .morning n^xt clay and proceeded by car to Nejef in the evening, I 'passed tne'tiight in Nejef and visited Koofa also. Next day morning 1 came back to Kerbella and after a stay of 2 hours I travelled by car to Baghdad reaching the latter place at 11 a .m. I utilized every minute that I had at my disposal and went round Baghdad seeing almost all important places. T left Baghdad on the Slst and arrived Basra on the 1st. During my short stay in Iraq I am glad I saw many things and I met many people. You will be interested to hear that it is not only the high authority and officials who accuse Kuwait of smuggling etc. but it appears to oe a general belief through out Iraq, almost every one I met asked me many questions auwut uhe smugglj.«g which they believed to be going on from Kuwait to Iraq on a large scale. They were probably given to undersold that almost everything importea into Iraq comes through Kuwait only, ^s much as it was possible for me to say I explained the things to the enquirers and told them that Kuwait was quite innocent in this affair as she took no part nor took any shares in the profits made by smugglers. They could blame their own people who found it a profitable business to bring things from outside Iraq, Kuwaitis were engaged in a legitimate trade and they sold their things to those who came to buy it. They also said that during the recent tribal troubles Kuwait did not play | ; a fair game ana supplied arms and ammunitions to/lthe rebels. I told them that it was a news for me as I never heard of such things as arms and ammunition to be available in Kuwait for the puipose of Miix sale, and there was strict embargo on importation of armb into that State and the Ruler showed his i good regard for his neighbour otate Iraq by allowing none to * J take xxaqc out any kind of arms from Kuwait. It was very unkind of Iraqis to misjudge Kuwait in that respect. Murid Husain, an Indian who has lately been naturalised Iraqi and is now station master at Kerbella told me that it was a general belief that there was a hand of British Government in the recent troubles and that all the amis supplied to the tribesmen came from iinglana ana through Kuwait only. He said that most of the Iraqis consider Kuwait as danger for their SWte and think that unless they have their own control in Kuwait they shall never be able to live in peace. This is the essence of the talks I had with several people in Kerbella Nejef and Baghdad. V/hile passing in front of the Persian Consulate at Baghdad I noticed that there was a crowd in the yard and to see what was happening inside I went in, I found that people had come there tp take out the Persian nationality papers. I learmt that thoseiw^cT had adopted Iraqi nationality to escape from the law of conscription in Persia were returning to Persian nationality to avoic the enlistment in the Iraq defence force unuer the Conscription law passed oy the Iraqi Government recently. | P.T.OConfidential* D »0* No»614-S of 1935• a The Residency, Bushire, the 13th August x935» 6l&lt; v Will you kindly refer to the third paragraph of your demi-official letter No»C~260 dated the 8th Kuguet 1935 about a newspaper campaign in ^aq against Kuwait• 2* It might be useful if you would collect evidence of this campaign over a period of say six months| so that we can gauge its intensity and decide whether any action can be taken or whether the evidence can be turned to any useiul purpose.

V Newspaper campaign in Iraq against Kuwait. &gt; &amp; Sir, f Reference^crbrrespondence ending vdth your Confidential D.O.iio.614 -3 , dated li3th au ,.ust 19b5, I have the honour to enclose translations of three articles (Marked 'A', and T, C !t ) which recently- appeared in the Arab Press of Iraq and Palestine. To be strictly accurate Tt ^ M and '0' appeared in Iraq newspapers, and ^C' was sent from Iraq to Palestine and was there reproduced in 'Al ?alestine ,r newspaper of 14th august. 2, The articles have only been taken at random, and my ^rab friends assure me that many others of a similar nature, have appeared in various Syrian newspapers as well as in those emanating from Iraq* 3, ^uite clearly the articles are inspired and hazarding a guess, they appear to bear the stamp of the newly created Iraq Linistry of Propaganda. 4 # Not only are the articles highly objectionable frcm the Kuwait point of view, but as far as I can see they have been written with the deliberate purpose (a) of undermining the authority of the Shaikh of Kuwait with his people: (b) Bringing into disrepute the good intentions and policy of His i.lajesty f s Government towards the x^rab otates of the Gulf. (c)(c) Arousing the young people of Kuwait to a sense of their supposed danger from the machiavellian poliqy of His Llajesty's G-overnment, and teaching them that their eventual salvation lies in union with Iraq. (d) Presenting a glowing picture to young Kuwait patriots of a future union of all Arab States into one great and indivisible Arab Nation under the aegis of Iraq - a grand conception for immature minds, 5. At the same time the articles, especially that headed tr C ft , offers the very subtle suggestion to the Shaikh, that if he falls into line with the 'Union' idea, he will not only rehabilitate himself in ^rab eyes, but will in actual fact gain in prestige and importance, seeing that his local independence will be assured, he will be safe from foreign aggression, and v /ith the high title of 'His Highness' (to be conferred on him) will feel that he has saved his country from absorption by England, ia non-Muslim State) and gained peace, progress and tranquility for himself and his people under the protective wings of Mother IRAQ,. 6. There is the still more subtle suggestion that His Majesty's G-overnment intends to declare a protectorate over Kuwait, showing that the writer knows how greatly such a suggestion would upset the Huler of i-uwai t ana his people if taken seriously (as it easily might be if the seed falls on good ground). 7.

The British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, it seems, visited Kuwait and told Shaikh iihmad al Jabir, shortly before the latter left for London, that the S British Government were no longer in a position to resist the protests that came to them without number from Governments which were adjacent to or near to Kuwait, dealing with the many either claims preferred by their subjects, or with the smuggling movement which has reached an alarming state, as the British Resident's repeated warnings to the Shaikh of Kuwait, which all urged the necessity of reforming and reorganizing the administration in Kuwait, have been of no avail, the British Government considers that it would be in the interest of Kuwait that the latter should accept the form of administration which was sometime ago introduced in Bahrain, and which resulted in a settled state of affairs there, i.e. that Kuwait should accept British advisers to supervise its administration, especially finance and justice. The Resident also told the Shaikh that he had received several applications fran the enlightened young- men of Kuwait, all of which stated that they (the applicants) were tired of the prevalent conditions in Kuwait, and- 2 - demanded that Kuwait should be annexed to Iraq. r, If this is impossible', they said, T, we request that the British Government should interfere with a view to reforming the state which has become intolerable,' The source (person) from which I have obtained this news, adds that Shaikh Ahmad refused the Residents proposals, and in consequence left for London to try a to convince the Colonial Office to give up this idea; and that the Resident told the Shaikh at the time that his visit to London would not affect these proposals which, in the interest of Kuwait itself, must be enforced^t»B» % Translation of an article (inspired from Baghdad) which appeared in the Palestine newspaper r, iil Palestine' under date 14th .august 1955• Tt THS PiSOPLt] OF KUWAIT ASPIR j ] TO BE U1CLT3D Vi ITH '♦THE BRITISH GOVSRMvIElfr ATTjSMPTS TO jIKTEI^ HSR PROTECTION OVER THAT COU13TRY ,, . From our own correspondent. Baghdad, dated 12th August (received by Air Hail). The youngmen of Kuwait have recently presented a petition to the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in which they expressed their aspiration and desire to be united v /ith Iraq. They said in their petition, that conditions in Kuwait did not agree with the keen desire felt by the people for introduc ing into their country the methods of modern civilization. It seems, however, that British policy aims at utlizing the bad state of affairs in Kuwait to bring that country unaer her direct control, as has been the case in Bahrain. It is said also that the (British) plan of uniting the Persian G-ulf Emirates into a sort of Confederation, which * was shown up by the Press some two years ago, has today been raised again. Indeed British political activities in the Persian Gulf have during the last few months gone far I a^K beyond j^s usual standard. *Note.by Political ^.-ent.

A further interesting article by Mr. Omr al-Taibi, which recently appeared in the n Fata- al-Arab n newspaper of Damascus, is also published below:- w Latest telegrams from Kuwait and Bagdad confirm that the leaders of the Kuwait youth movement have telegra phed pleading that their country should be united with •Iraq; and that a party selected from among themselves, have actually met* the British Political Agent at Kuwait, and demanded from him the realization of their aspirations. The idea of union between the State of Kuwait and its rising neighbour,the Kingdom of 'Iraq, is one of very long standing. The people of Kuwait indeed crave for such union, not because they hate their rulers who have always been kind to them, but because they recognize tns great advantages that their country will derive following such a union; and they appreciate the necessity for greatei solidarity among Arab nations, in this age of economic progress, when it will be impossible for small territories, and a divided nation to survive unless they one and all are re-united and fused together by means of one crucible. There is no doubt that the reciprocal interests of both the people of Kuwait and the people of ^raq are now one and will become steadier with the bonds of close relationship growing stronger day by day. Iraqi nationals own/own properties in Kuwait, eind Kuwaitis own properties in 'Iraq, and each is treated by his brother, and by Hie author ities of the other country with all respect and regard* Further the Posts and Telegraphs Service has already been unified in the two countries, with much advantage to both» Neverthless if both countries were to be wholly united, the result would be Entirely admirable: For ♦Iraq would benefit from the natural position of Kuwait, seeing that the latter is a good seaport; and Kuwait for her part would benefit from the introduction of a proper administration, the developement of education, and improved trade, seeing that present restric tions between the two countries would then be abolished* Moreover, such union will be the focus point or nucleus of the great Arab empire, which all Arab peoples are endeavour ing to attain, a movement which has become so important as to be recognized by Arab kings and rulers, who have commenced singing its praises and trying to; realize it* The offer to join Kuwait with ♦Iraq by the A1 Sabah dynasty would be a new and remarkable service to the future Arab nation® Nay it will surpass all others that have gone before* It is quite a probablity the^ that Kuwait diiould become an 'Iraqi Emirate, and that her ruler would be recog- Emir nized as His Highness the tmmaai/ot Kuwait* And last but not ffinir *8 least the toaaat/sons also could be appointed to hold high positions under the Government of 'Iraq* The late Shaikh Mubarak has already in the Ottoman period, borne the title of Qaim-Maqam, This designation, however, did not prevent the Emir Mubarak from being a very good raler who always strove to promote the welfare of his country* Likewise the conferring of the title of His Highness on the present Emir, in place of the unimportant one of Shaikh of Kuwait, a British protected town, and the fact that ths State had taken refuge under the'Iraqi Arab standard, would affbrd a unique opportunity for His Highness the JSnir to serve the/,1 the rest of Arabia, with his high endowments, and to co operate with the kings and leaders of the other Arab countriei The ruler of Kuwait as well as the people are all men who put great store on their nationality and their reli- gion^ and cannot possibly prefer foreign protection to the bonds of nationality and religion* For the rest the annexation of Kuwait to ♦Iraq, would create a state of tranquility on the Arab coast of the Gulf; would make the Emirate secure against any sudden attacks and would save her from malign foreign influence, and from -m being a centre for plotting intrigues against Arab nationalisj ^the East, and especially the Islamic East» Such union would bring about better understanding between Arab countries, and would offer no opportunity to i foreigners to interfere in the settlement of the differences between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on the question of ♦♦MusabaLT, or any other questions, on the ground Hiat Kuwait was under British protection# The state of anxiety and confusion now prevailing in europe, calls for deep thinking as to what will be the eventual fate of Arab countries should 'they continue in their present attitude* When Arab countries are united, Arab peoples will be able to raise their voices high in the defence of their rights and their place in world socie/ty* Theix and only then will they be prepared to communicate their mission Ing to all the countries of the East, and to become a support/^© pillar in the cause of peace* *Note by the Political Agent * A fabrication of course*/ Ho 111 /85/55 A Vf il HIS Majesty's Oharg^' d'Affaires Bagdad presents his compliments to the Hon'ble the OulfBuahlre^ ' and has the honour to transmit to him the under-mentioned documents.

'B' ditto ditto which appeared in the TT AL BILAD' newspaer under date 26 th August 1935. 2 # I have little to add to the reiimrks passed by me in my previous letter under reierence but article B is interesting and illuminating as it comes from the famous jS^yptian newspaper the Muqattam, a reliaole daily which we may lilcen to the 'Times ' in the Middle Jlast. you will note that the writer of the article openly says that we have turned Muscat and Bahrain into virtual British possessions, and hints in veilea fashion that Kuwait which has preserved her independence still may be the next to go into the Lion's maw. 4# Obviously the Iraq newspaper f, Al Bilad', has reproduced the 'I.iuqattam's' article, because it fits in with the views of various propaganda writers in Iraq, who are seeking to persuade Kuwait to enter the Iraq fold, be/ore the villain of the piece, His Majesty's Oovemment seizes her- 2 - her for herself, 5 # As these and the previous articles which I sent you, have had the worst possible effect in Kuwait, I would, with deep respect, suggest, and provided you see no objection to such course, that the articles now sent you together ?/ith those enclosed in my despatch No•0-269 be forwarded on to His Majesty's Government, even though His Ilajesty's Charge* d*Affaires in Baghdad appears to have already taken some action with H.iil.Yasin Pasha, and with satisfactory results, vide paras 3 and 4 of British jJmbassy's despatch No.451, dated the 20th iOigust 19 35, to the Right Hon'ble Sir Samuel Hoare,Bt., G.G.S.I., Gr.B.E*, etc. etc. (copy of which was sent to me under your Printed Letter No.694-S of 6 th September). V ^ M' ^ Lf 1+ ^ Un ^ plfi* g # The reason why I venture to make the above sug gestion is that H.iii. the Shaikh Oo. i^uwait * s recen^ /isit to England may be said to be bound up with and to have been undertaken largely as a result of this pernicious propaganda, which has been going against his State in Iraq for a very considerable time now. 7 # There seems little doubt in my mind that both the ohaikh and his people believed in July last that His Majesty's Government were weakening, as a result of the Iraq Government's calculated and persistent attacks in the matter of 'smuggling', and that Kuwait was in eminent danger of being surrendered to Iraq, or of being brought under His Majesty's Government's direct control, which the iraq Government's proposal to appoint a British director of Customs, restrict her imports etc. etc. was understood to mean. To the Shaikh and his people the very life and existence of Kuwait as an independent -ti.rab State was in danger and he decided to act and act quickly. (His original intention //as I believe to have petitioned H.L .the King jImpe-C- &gt; in person). 8./8 That liie shaikh is now believed to have been successful in his mission to London, may be guaged from the truly remarkable and amazing reception which was given him on his return to Kuwait when, as already reported to you by telegram, thousands of liedouin came in frcm distances of over a 100 miles to welcome him, and fully 25,000 townsmen (excluding a demonstration of 2000 women who met him inside the city gates) collected on the aerodrome to shake hands with him. Here in spite of the efforts of over 500 armed policemen and fidawis, the crowd broke bonds, and surged round the reception shed set apart for the Shaikh and strove to shake hands with him or embrace hira. Ailly 5000 weeping and hysterical persons actually reached the Shaikh and wrung his hands, before it was found possible to get him into his car and drive him away. I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant 'Lt,-Colonel, Politi cal Agent, Kuwait.W A &lt;r Translation of an article from the 'Al-Iraq' newspaper of Baghdad, Ho. 3958, dated the 19th ^ugust 1935 KU./AIT ON THul CROboROADb. IT IS NOi TILE FOR RSFOHIviiiTION,OR ARE THE PE0PL3 STILL DOZING IN THEIR INDOLENCE? I was the first person to hear of the proposal which the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presented to His Highness Shaikh ^hmad al Jabir as Sahah before the latter packed off for the Briti da Capital - the proposal v /hich urged the necessity for reforming the situation in Kuwait by re-organizing its Government under the supervision of the British advice. Indeed, I was the first person to hear of this important news; am the v/ay I heard it admitted of no doubt in the truth of it. I, however, did not like then to make io puolic, ou u o. pity for the name of an Arab country v /hich we regret to see compelled by a foreign power to refonn its own affairs. Those at the helm ought of their own accord to carry out the reformation, so as not to leave room lor t^ny political aspirant to achieve his ends. However, now that the news auout v/hich i ciLi going to write. has appeared in the daily newspapers, and the Government of Kuwait has kept silent on the report tnd aade no comments, and has furthermore not even bothered to deny it, I have no choice but to put in my wcrd on this serious event in the political history of Kuwait. I am particularly constrained to do this because I, as my readers know, and as His Hi^mess the Shaikh also knows in particular, was the first person who discussed Kuwait politics sericasly.- 2 - seriously, and wrote a great, a very great deal in connection with the necessity of reforming the affairs and resources of Kuwait. The result of my writings, however, appears to have had no effect whatsoever. In 1^2 2 there arose in lluvrait a progressive nation al spirit, kindled by unique intelligence, and enhanced by diligent reading of newspapers and magazines. The youth of Kuwait then had a voice which resounded throughout the Arabian world, and on which most of the leading Arab newspapers made comments - a voice which demanded reforms, and lamented the negligence of those in power.Jhose who read newspapers were aware that there were Kuwaiti writers,whose pens had a good press in the columns of Iraqi newspapers. Among all,however, this paper was the leader. She carried the torch of reform ation, and was a resort for Kuwaiti free-thinkers, and in her columns were published the products of their pens, which caus ed hearts to bleed and made not only the merciful but also every hard-hearted man to shed tears. That auspicious movement went on for some years, and people hoped that it would bring the best of results to the State of Kuwait, which Nature has endowed with a unique position in xirabia, and whose importance will shortly emerge, moreover, the ab ov emeriti on ed movement rose just after the accession of Shaikh Ahmad who was famous for his sympathy for reformation, and for his bitter criticism of those in power, because they were leading Kuwait in her ruin. Ill luck, however, refused to leave Kuwait, and insisted that it should remain a target for those who have ambitions and ends to achieve, and for those vaho try to fish in turbid water, and cannot fill their pockets except when disorder exists and anarchy prevaiIs.Sovery soon the reformers were driven out or persecuted. Some of them indeed were compelled to leave their country; and others suffered of all kinds of trouble. Newspaper readers were very badly treated, and writers were warned that they must ■they must cease from writing anything in the Iraq Press. Jhe 'Al Iraq'* newspaper was banned from Kuwait, and punishments were inflicted upon those who smuggled it into Kuwait, Thus and by such means the plan was laid to kill the reform movement in Kuwait. In this the plan to a certain degree succeeded, although its after effects were pernicious to Kuwait - a fact which suggests itself to everyone who possesses the power of thinking. Ay! the reform movement in Kuwait received its coup de grace and fell a victim to shameful ignorance. Upon her grave, reformers shec. tears of blood, and their lamentation was deep - That was because she died, or to 'out it more clearly, was killed at a time when the whole world was racing in the course 01 progress b, leaps anci bounds in the same way that electricity was acj.vin£ trie place of other forms of power. Accoraingly, Kuwait has remained standing in its bedouin mentality, bereft from reforms botii in her administra- - tion and in education. As to the disorder that prevails in an Emirate whose state of affairs is such: as to the distress that comes as an inevitable result of sucn a s^ate Ox ait airs these both are matters which we need not bother to substantiate or comnjent on. V/e were afraid indeed as well as other wri ters, who had criticised the state of affairs in Kuwait, when they saw the plans which the British Political Resident has lately unfolded. The blow has fallen, and I say so with much sorrow and grief. But even at this stage the danger can be averted, as a little of thinking over the present situation will induce the Government of Kuwait itself to carry out the reformation. Now, in this neighbouring Kingdom (of 1 Iraq), for wliiobwe bear sincere affection, and whose progress afi'ects- 4 - / affects us directly, there exist many persons who are prepared to cooperate with their brethren of Kuwait and set right the mischiefs that are killing her. It is only by reformation that we can keep out those trying to violate our rights. However resolute we may be, it is of no avail for us merely to assume a negative attitude. This is my sincere advice which I solemnly offer to His Highness the imir of :_uwait, and am all confid nee that he will be so wise as to avoid the peril of foreign tyranny, into which Bahrain has already fallen, and for which she suffered, in Major Daly's time, the most terrible and distressing results.

The editor of eastern politics in the n Al x.Iuqattam leading newspaper (of ^gypt) corninenting on the Jmir of Kuwaiti journey to Jngland, said:- Tt Those who are acquainted below the surface with the true state of affairs, confirm that the .Amir's journey- to England was in response to an invitation fran the Oil Company which recently obtained a conffiessionto exploit Gil in his Emirate* I'hat, they maintain, was the real cause of the ^mir*s journey. The Emir travelled to Baghdad ana proceeded to i .Iosul and Nesibin, from where he took the Orient -depress to Europe via Istanbul, It is, however, understood that the ^nir during his stay at London, saw a specialist about a disease he had in his mouth; and that he a-so met certain members of the G -overnment who received him with honour and sincere pleasure, as is their custom with all prominent visitors to their country. L r o change in xolitics. further, we have learnt from a reliable source that there is no truth in the rumour that the -iair tried to induce the Colonial Office in London to instruct their representative in the Persian Gulf to abandon the enforce ment of the plan, which consisted in the desire to limit the jurisdiction allowed to the Persian Gulf shaikhs, seeing that neither the Colonial Office, nor the Resident himself has such a plan. The British authorities, it appears, do not propose to bring about any change orchange or alteration in the political systems of the Gulf jimirates at present. On uhe other hand everyone of the Arab dimirates on the Persian Gulf has got its own system which differs from that of the others, and the relations of each with the British Government,a£0 different from the relations of its neighbours. l.uiiiber of the Pirates. The Emirates are eight in number. Tty$§«r names are as follows:- Las cat, Has al .Ihaimah, Gharga, Abu Lhabi, Dubai, ^atar, Bahrain and Kuwait. They are all situated on the western coast of the Gulf. The eastern coast belongs to Iran, and is free from any foreign influence. The Chief .j^ir^t^s. The largest of these Emirates are three: Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait, The first lies at the southern end of the Gulf, and is adjacent to dind, while Kuwait lies at the northern end of it, ana borders upon Nejd and Iraq. As to Bahrain, it is composed of a group of islands, the largest of which are Manama, Luharraq, which include the towns of Rifa*, Hidd and Budaiyi*. As to the rest of the ^mirates, i.e. Ras al Khaima, Sharga, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and ^atar: These are smaller, less important and lower in rank than the other three mentioned above. The population in some of them do not exceed a few hundreds living in small areas. s The relations of each of the three principal Emirate with Great Britain, are different frcm the relations of its neighbours; and the first to have relations with the British, were Muscat and Bahrain. In 1861 a treaty was concluded between the Shaikh of Bahrain and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, in which the Resident undertookundertook to preserve the security of the Shaikhs territory and to repel from it any incursions, and in return the Shaikh promised to abandon the equipment of ships and troops. Another treaty was concluded in 1880 between Shaikh 'Isa bin Khalifa (father of the present Shaikh) and the British G-overnment, in which the Shaikh of Bahrain under took not to conclude a treaty with, or grant a concession to any other Government, without first obtaining the approval of His Majesty r s G-overnment. Nevertheless, in 19 23 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, deposed the shaikh of Bahrain, the same Shaikh who ratified the Treaty of Protection, and instituted his son (the present Shaikh) in his place. In this t 0 way, the Resident manage^ seize the r^irgns of real authority / which is exercised by him upto this day. Kuwait came under British protection in 1913, when consequent to a family trouble its l^mir Shaikh Liubarak-as- Sabah (grandfather of the present _i^air) resorted to asking assistance of the British Government. I'he Turks were then threatening. A British warsliip was at once sent to the waters of Kuwait. After the Great ./ar a British Agency was also located at Kuwait. But the British Government do not interfere directly in the internal affairs of this Emirate, as they do in Bahrain. As regards Luscat whose rulers bear the title of Sultans: This State was the greatest and most important power in the Gulf. But since 1864 the British started interfering with its affairs, until in 1913 they succeeded in concluding a treaty with her, under which she came under their protection. This event led to a series of internal disturbances, which divided the country into two sections: (a) the coasts, with ikascat as Capital, which submitted to the A1 Sa^d, a British protected dynasty; and (b) the interior which preserved its independence, and established an Imamate at 'Nazwa'. The British representative at l.Iuscat- 4 - % Muscat is designated a ^Councillor rt , but in reality is almost the actual ruler. This is what can today be said in a brief like this, about the position of the rersian Gulf Arab Emirates and their Govemiiient systems. I write these few words, in the hope that they may remove all differences and contentions now existing among them, which action is essential if they want to unite their affairs?CAP Gonfidenti &amp;X• U0.766-S of 1935.

The *Iraqi owns property in Kuwait and the roiwaiti owns property in ^Iraq. jiiach of them gets every assistance and respect from his fellow-brother and also from the ruler of the other-s country, ihe post, telegraph and te^hone have already been united between the two countires, the fact which proved /s cC&gt; that this step was in the interests of both countries, should both countries be now united, 1 Iraq will jet benefit of Kuwait which is situated on the sea and not on Shatt-al-* Arab 5 and, at the same time, Kuwait will get the benefit of modern reforms, spread of education in the country, l iraq society and of the removal of all the existing restrictions, ihis will lead to the increase and revive of trade, spread of education in Kuwait and will also become the seed for the establishment of an Arab empire, for which the Arabs are wor&amp;ing^and the necessaity for it is being felt by the ^ings and Amirs of Arabia, who seek, hope for and endeavour to bring this fact into existence.'£he annexation of Kuwait with ^iraq will be considered as a more valuable service, which the aubah family would offer to the 'Arab nation in addition to their past services, it would be possible to make Kuwait as an ^Iraq province governed by tiis fixe 11 ency the Amir of Kuwait and that the sons of the Amirs of this btate would be able to serve under the r Iraq government in senior posts, uiring the lurkish time shaikh Mubarak as-sabah was holding the title of (jaim-maqam. rhis did not prevent jmbarak, as a ruler, from becoming a reformer in their uurkish} country ^Kuwait) or prevent him doing his best for its advance, rhe change, for example, of the office of nis excellency the Amir of Kuwait under the British protection to that of the Amir of Kuwait under the 'Iraq *Arab standard, will pave the way before nis isxcellency the Amir to use his energy for the benefit of the rest of the ^Arab countries and to co-operate with the other 'Arab ruler^and leaders in order to construct the foundation for an r Arab union and build up the desired f Arab /—3— l Arab empire, rhe rulers and the Amirs of Kuwait, v/ho are strict about their nationality and religion have never preferred a foreign protection to an i Arab union and to a national and religious ties.4.he annexation of ruiwait with *iraq will lead to a state of peace on the uoast of the ^Arab (iulf and, at the same time, will keep this state in a stffe position in case of sudden happenings, and will also guard it against foreign control, to which it might be subjected, and will prevent using it as a place for intrigues against the ^Arab's nationalist, the j^ast and the xs'Jamic niast. xt will also give a chance for a real understanding among the v Arab states instead of disputes, and thus will leave no chance to the foreigners to interfere in the matter of settling the dispute,about the bablah and other matters, between Kuwait and the l Arab kingdom, on the plea of a British rrotection to jsuwait. ihe unsettled state of affairs in Ettrope call for a deep thinking as to what will be the faith of 1 Arabia if it were to remain in its present state, when the ^Arab states are united, the r Arabs can make their voice, about the protection of their rights and status, more heard* xhey will also be able to send their mission to all the eastern countires, which fact will stand as a strong pillar for peace and liberty. we hope that the union of Kuwait with J Iraq, which is the ideal of every 'Arab, will be achieved as soon as possible. bign e d: - 4 Umar at- x abi.si is Confidential.

I have the honour to be, Sir , Your most obedient servant. Lt^-Colonel, Political .ugent, Kuwait.(i) Translation of an article which appeared in the rt Al Karklr' weekly newspaper of Baghdad, No.318, dated the 12th -august 19 35» THE NECS^SITY OF V/SLDING KUWAIT Ii4T0 UNION wlTH , IRa^. In view of the report that important changes are to be shortly introduced into the iSmirate of Kuwait, and that numerous telegrams were recently received here, which stated that the British Colonial uffice have finally decided to bring that part of Arabia under their direct control, and to change the form of its government, it has become binding over the Iraq G-overnment to make urgent 4; efforts to accede to the requests of the enlistened youth in Kuwait who eagerly demM that they should be united, with 'Iraq, and that Kuwait should be finally annexed to this country (Iraq)* Any observer of the geographical position of Kuwait will no doubt give preponderance to its being annexed to Iraq; also because the majority of the Kuwaiti educated youngmen desire to fall in the bosom of their mother - the Iraq. Moreover, most of the thought leaders in the above i &amp;airate descend from Iraqi families; and above all it is dia? rectly connected with this country (Iraq) and is an integral part of it. Affinity, uniformity of customs and manners and the bonds of blood, religion and language - all these firm connections leave no room for doubt in the fact that Kuwait is an integral part of Iraq and that it will remain so. Any contradictory idea should be rejected and should receive no attention at all* Further, by annexing Kuwait to Iraq the latter will get rid of the calamity of smuggling which has in the last couple of years had the worst efl'ect upon the trade of Iraq.(11) Translation of an article which appeared in the 'A1 Karkh Tt weekly newspaper of Baghdad, No.319, dated the 19th August 1925 • RESPONSE SHOULD HBi AG0OHD31) TO THE KUWAITI YOUTH'S AFFKaL. ihenever I have been to kuwait for a short s^y I have been visited from time to time by the Kuwait youth who have entreated me to communicate to the authorities in Iraq their assured aspirations on the pages of the n ^l Karkh n newspaper, which Kuwaitis regard as the best interpreter for what they feel in the bottom of their hearts of the pro pensities and aspirations. Many of them have given me articles for publication in my p^per. Therefore, transmit ting the nessage entmsted to me by that great party of youth with whom we are united by bonds of blood, religion, language and tradition, I say. Young Kuwaitis like their colleagues throughout the world very eagerly feel that they must move with the times in the matter of science aiid literature; they are well aware that where main is, there must be instituted a system of education and general culture. Further, they recognize perfectly well that ruin will be the fate of a nation which has not achieved much of progress and civiliz ation, and which has not attained its position the civilization of this modern world. The youth of Kuwait are aware of the early stages of decay and deterioration that have appeared over their imiirate, for it is void of any educational system, school or institution to provide the necessary tuition for those young people who are thirsty for learning; and of anything that can be called a '♦State Organization' 1 or a ''Municipal Organization* 1 to take interest in the people's aftairs and put them on the right way - Therefore, for this and other good reasons the young Kuwaitis insist upon the realization of their desire in being united with the rising nation of- 2 - nation of Iraq; they herein make their entreaty to the statesmen of Iraq, so jealous in Arab matters, to save a vast army of citizens from the dark abyss of ignorance now prevalent in Kuwait, They want us to ask our statesmen, in the name of Arab nationalism to do their best to annexe the said jimirate, bereft from the light of learning and civilization, to the Kingdom of Iraq, which, by virtue of her faith full children^ efforts, is now in the full gaze of the Arab i an w o rid # 3o far we have dealt with the matter frcm a scientific and educational point of view. Now we turn to political side of it: young Kuwaitis consider that it is a disgrace to live under the yoke of foreign rule , while the Iraqi nation, with whom they are connected by bonds of nationality, religion and home, enjoys national Government and lives quite an independent life,. Having rendered this message which has been entrusted t o me by the Kuwaiti youth I, in my turn now, should like to say: The Statesmen of Iraq, who will no doubt do their best to save this up rising youth from the abyss of dark ignorance, must save (obscurely wcrded) Arab youth with whom we are connected by ties of blood; they are our kinsfolk and we are theirs, without any distinction save that dictated by the ambitions of imperialism which none of the Arabs will admit, A glance at the map of Iraq is sure to prove that Kuwait is in Iraqi territory, and sooner or later it will of necessity be such* The foregoing items, when realized, cannot but react to the benefit of the population of the abovementioned Kmlrate. On the other hand the benefit to Iraq will be no less in importance, seeing that the least that may result will be the eradicatio of smuggling which has had the worst effect upon the trade of Ira^, and which has greatly reduced imports through Iraqi Gustoias, thus causing- 3 - thus causing heavy losses to this young Kin^dora. The benefit is, therefore, double sided a.id will be shared by both countries equally. Rulers unquestionably realize this fact more than anyone else; they ^lould take upon themselves the duty of carrying out this remunerative concern, .ve depend upon their efforts. iiL (Proprietor of the newspaper).- 2 - Eritlksh loverrineiit, having decided to change their policy in this country, terminated his services in Iraq, and appointed him as a Political ^gent at Bahrain. J'or reasons not as yet known to us he was again discharged fron the political service, and for about one year he remained without political worfc. In 1921 a difference which had arisen between His ivlajesty King Ibn baud and i-iajor Daly, the British Political ^gent at Bahrain, gave him a chance to resume his political career. The cause of the abovementioned difference was as follows; .according to the provisions of the treaty between him and the British Government, Kir^ Ibn Saud, then Sultan of Nejd, was bound to send through the Political ^gent at Bahrain all his communications with the British Government. He observed then that Daly opposed him. He, therefore, protest ed ancl asked that the mediator ^lould be a person other than Daly. The British Government, famous as they are, to seize opportunities for turning anything into benefit, instructed their High Commissioner for Iraq, thai bir Percy Cox, to open negotiations with ibn baud in regard to the difference arising between him and Major D^.y. bir Percy, it is understood liked Dickson and watched an opportunity to get him an appoint ment. He, therefore, proposed him a s a British Political .agent at Ibn Saud's Court with headquarters at (^atif. By this proposal bir Percy wanted to hit two birds with one stone. But Ibn baud refused this proposal on the plea that the fanatic people of Nejd would in no case agree to the appointment ol Consuls in their country. Consequently bir Percy Cox persuaded his Government of the necessity of appointing Dickson as a Political i 'ediator between them and Ibn baud, on the understanding that his headquarters TOuld be at Bahrain. The British Government agreed to this; and Dickson continued to occupy that office until at last Ibn baud tore up his treaty with the British Government after he had invaded the Hijaz and obtained hishis complete independence. Thereafter Dickson (in the rank of Major) was transferred to Hyderabad (India) to serve in the British Garrison at the Haja of Hyderabad^ capital. But in 1930 he was reappointed to the corps of Political Agents in the Persian Gulf. This is the Colonel Dickson who has now been appointed by the iSmir of Kuwait as his representative to the Company that has obtained an Oil concession in his Jimirate. However, we do not know whether or not the -juir 1 s represent ative will succeed in the settlement of the difference arising between King Ibn oaud and the Oil Company. Perhaps vie may in our next issue be able to weite full particulars about the abovementioned appointment.'f CONFIDENTIAL. 1I0.932-S of 1935.

The article as you will see is written in sarcastic vein, nd is a scurrilous, and hardly veiled attacn on Kuwait and her ohalkh. 4 # i cannot believe that the present article or even the two previous ones, have in any way been inspired oy a person or persons connected with the Saudi x^rabian G-ovem- ment prefer to suppose that the editor is endeavouring to 'blackmail' the ohaiich, into payiog him a lump sum down to cease from writing against Kuwai t» ^,.ir is ano.

In any case I think i t is up to the Iraq Government to keep her press from publishing dangerous rubbish of this sort, more especially as there is an undercurrent in each article p of vicious propaganda intended obviously to discredit a friendly ruler and neighbouring State in the eyes of the Iraq newspaper reading public, 6, The two previous articles in the LTas (I regret I have been unable to obtain a copy of the first though I have referred to it) , followed by the present one, have created no little stir in Basra, and 1 have myself received a personal enquiry from a leaaiiig ^asra notable, asking what truth there was in the statement published in the Tt ^l lias', that Bin oaud was going to prevent the Kuwait Oil Company from working their Concession, as well as enquiring whether I had been appointed as the Shaikh's representative in London* 7 » I need hardly mention that neither I nor the Shaikh have divulged anything regarding the question of the Chief Local Hepresentativeship and it woulc. seem as if some hostile oil interests were again at work.

It is nearest in semblance to a communique, ana assuming that it emanates from the State of Kuwait is to the best of our knowledge, the first communique that that btate has yet sent to a newspaper. We are glad, that it was sent to the Tt ^l Nas n newspaper, whose name will be associated with this historical communique, ^n the other hana we cannot conceal our regret for the mistakes it contains, which has indeed caused us to forbear from publishing same. Communiques are usually issued only by authorized Government officials, while in the present case all that v/e know about the v/riter of the statement is that he is the son of Mulla Saleh, a Clerk in the Shaikh's employ, and merely to be thus related does not of course entitle him to issue co.-imuniques in the name of tha State of Kuwait. ^e are quite prepared to publish any denial to the news mentioned in our previous publication alchougn it was derived from the most reliable sources, provided that (a) if Abdulla al Mulla Saleh wants to follow the example of the anuouncements which appear in the tress Oi. civilized countries, he write under his official designation if he holds an office at all; and provided that ib) we- 2 - l( we do not refuse to publisti what he sends in, on the grounds that he has not given his official designation, and provided he writes politely in the style used by writers in their reftorts, but not in the language of authority and the accents of rulers. Moreover, we seize this opportunity given us by this very polite youngman, xxbdulla al Mulla oaleh, to ask him whether he is prepared to inform us; (i) Vftiether the Kuwait Oil Company has now started operations, more especially in the Subaihiyeh area? (ii) ihether the south and south eastern frontiers of Kuwait stand as th^y were defined by the treaty of Uqair in 1921? (iii) /hether he is possessed of such qualifications as to entitle him kindly to explain to us what has become of the Oil Concession granted for the Neutral territory whiefe which is shared by both Kejd and Kuwait? (iv) it is asserted that the otate of Ku.rait declined to publish the Oil agreement among Kuwaitis who frcm the highest to the lowest knov/ k nothing of it. Can he deny this? (v) 'YouId he be so kind as to send us a copy of the said agreement so that we can decorate the front page of our paper with it, printing His Highness shaikh ^hmad al Jabir as Sabah's photograph at the top.

It is understood that the oaudi Government entirely decline to recognize the Kuwait frontiers, idiich were ratified by the Treaty of 1921, on the ground that wheu :iis Majesty king Ibn oaud signed the treaty-, relating to these frontiers his concurrence was only temporary - It was merely to please his friend ^ir Percy Cox (that he di^ so) , whose mission to Uqair was the last important matter that he had to put throu^i in the -ast, therefore His Majesty did not like that he should leave the ^ast unsatisfied, Further, the King's representative at the above- mentioned Conference adds that when King Ibn ^aud signed the said agreement, he declared openly that he v. ould not be boiud by it. example of how the British representative, who signed the Uejd-Kuwait frontier treaty at Uqair, was tben aware of Ibn baud's reservations, was the provision in that m r MM ||KBV:in agreement of a clause to the effect that a particular area claimed by liejd, was t o be declared a neutral zone, ana was not settled finally.

The two articles from 'An Nas', of which copies were enclosed in your despatches, are less openly objectionable, and I doubt whether it would serve any useful purpose for me to make representations to the Iraqi Government regarding these articles, especially since the more recent one appeared over a month ago. I have, however, requested nis -i.ajesty's Consul at Basra to inform me at once of any farther objectionable articles regarding Kuwait which may appear in the Basra press, in order that i may be enabled, if i consider it advisable, to bring them to the notice of the Iraqi Government before too long a time has elapsed since the date of their publication. ?ile Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel t .C .v/.

As this article contained a suggestion that it was the intention of the Iraqi Government to annex Kuwait to Iraq., I took the opportunity of an interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on December 83rd to draw His Excellency's attention to the article. Nuri Pasha denied that the Iraqi Government had any idea of annexing Kuwait and promised to arrange for a dementi to he issued 'by the Press Bureau. Statements to the effect that there was no truth in the suggestion made 'by 'Al Karkh' duly appeared on December 27th in most of the Bagdad newspapers, and one of them added that they had received this information from the Department of Propaganda and Publicity. 3. Nuri Pasha also promised me that he would give His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait personal assurances regarding the intentions of the Iraqi Government during his coming visit to Kuwait. 4. ,T Al Karkh' is, of course, a Bagdad newspaper, and I regret that ray despatch under reference was so worded as to give the impression that, like 'An Nas', it was published in Basra. 5.

In a leader under the above heading, written a propos the three recent encounters between smugglers and the Iraqi special police force, in one of which the former were found to be using an armed car, the editor declares that the only effective means for putting an end to smuggling is the annexation of Kuwait to the Kingdom of Iraqo In this connection the editor writes ; 'Indeed, if the sufferings which Iraq has been experiencing through Kuwait were experienced by another State through a principality such as Kuwait, such other State would shake the world and find in smuggling incidents an excuse for the annexation of that principality to its territories to form an integral part thereof, .^e believe that the authorities themselves agree with us in this view and in the belief that the only means of overcoming this formidable obstacle lies in the annexation of that principality to Iraq and the removal of customs and other barriers existing between the former and the latter 'If incidents recur and the activities of smugglers assume a new phase, the authorities will perhaps be moved to make serious endeavours for the annexation of Kuwait to Iraq.' En passant the editor observes ; 'In any case, whether the motive behind smuggling is one of a purely economic nature with no other interests being involved, or there are certain external political influences at play aiming at something other than profit through smuggling, it is not sufficient for us to double our police force and incur endless expenditure,, The only solution for the problem lies, as already pointed out by Us ) in the annexation of Kuwait to Iraq.'.Confidential• 13&gt; The Residency, D .0.

I propose informing the Shaikh (of Kuwait) of the result of your interriew with Kuri Pasha (giTen in the latter of the t vo despatches quoted above), and I have no doubt thit this will have the effect of easing his mind With regard to annexation, . y* 2. TTnfortunately . have just ^tceived a further * Iraqi Press attack on Kuwait which ^ enclose ( jickson* a iilxpress Letter of 2nd January 1936, Fo.C-l, with a translation of the frticle in question). The 'An Kafj' article seems to be a particularly pernicious production. Briefly it states that when the Treaty of *Oqair whs made Bin Saud's concurr ence was only temporary, that he merely pretended to concur to please an old friend - Sir Percy Cox, that he declared openly that he would not be bound by its terms, and that Cox knew this perfectly well. The article then goes on to mention the detaching' of the Neutral Zone by the Saudi Government from ICuwait by which the latter would lose possible valuable oilfields. 5. N &amp;turally we know thut this article is a farrago of nonsense, but this is by no means the opinion that will be taken by the average 'Iraqi, JKejdi, or Kumiti, who may read the / Archiba ld Clark Kerr ,K.C.M.O., His r -ajesty's Ambassador, Bagdad•\ the article, or, if illiterate, may Hear about it, or even by the Shaikh, of Kuwait himself. vVhen the * Iraqi Press talk about the Annexing* of Kuwait, though naturally this is annoying to the Shaikh, the latter must know (at least I presume he does) that if the 1 Iraqi Grovernment were ever so stupid as to attempt annexation this would be an act of war which we would deal with speedily and effectively. But this talk about Bin Baud going back on the 1 Oqair Treaty, and Cox knowing about Bin Saud 1 s real intentions at the time he made the Treaty, seems to me a good deal more harmful® The Chaikh has always felt very sore over this Treaty which he feels (vide Dickson's demi-official letter of 2nd October 1934 to the India Office, vide India /p-IWo V&gt; Office Printed Letter No,P•Z,6160/34 of 19th October 1934) gave away tribes and territory to Bin Saud which rightly belonged to Kuwait. The Feutral Zone especially he looivS on as belonging by right to him (vide Dickson's letter quoted above) and not as joint property between himself and Bin Saud as it was made by the Treaty. 4. I am sure he will not suspect Cox, who was a friend of his, of bad faith, but the whole trend of the article may well leave an uneasy feeling in his mind with regard to the Keutral Zone. I shall do my best to disabuse him of this feeling by telling him that the article is of course - ^as he knows' - rubbish from beginning to end. 5. With regard to Dickson 's Express Letter I think it unlikely that the article was inspired, from Riath, and agree with the suggestion imde in his paragraph 3 that its motive is probably pecuniary. ♦ I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe, Walton and Dickson. v , V ^ ♦sent under d.o.P.L.No.39-S of 10/1/36.P9 _ ISrS (Copy forwerded to the Govt. of India under d.o.P.L.

I fully realize the 'bad impression which articles, such as that which appeared in 'An Nas' on December 19th, may create in Kuwait. But I do not see what I can do to stop their publication. When the local press is personally offensive to the Shaikh of Kuwait or fathers on the Iraqi Government the intention of annexing Kuwait, then I feel justified in making representations to the Iraqi Government. But political gossip like the article from 'An Nas' is quite a dilTerent matter and is the currency of journalists all over the world. I am afraid therefore that we can only rely on the Political Agent to calm the Shaikh and to persuade him to treat this sort of stuff with the contempt it deserves. 3' I regret to say that there has been another crop oi articles in Bagdad newspapers regarding the possible annexation N HU LIKUTiSNANT-00L0NEL T.C.W. POWLE, CBE,8 annexation of Kuwait by Iraq. These articles put forward the idea as coming from the young men of Kuwait, so that it was a little difficult for me to take any effective action, I did draw the attention of the Prime Minister to them on January 2Vth, hut he made the ohvious comment that the Iraqi Government had no intention of annexing Kuwait, that they had already issued a statement to this effect, and that he could not see what more they could do, 4, If these articles are 'brought to the attention of the Shaikh, perhaps Dickson could take the line that if the yomg men of Kuwait do not desire annexation to Iraq, then he need not he perturbed by these irresponsible and fallacious articles: if they do, then it is up to him and not to the Iraqi Government to take appropriate measures, ^ I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel and Dickson.COHFIDSUTIAL. % v POLITICAL , No.C-74. | -71 KUWAIT, '37 $ ' . .

I.D.25,000 and I.D.30. ^The 'im Nas' newspaper of Basrah has published a 'word in its latest number, in which it said that the 'British Government gave a pledge to both the ioaeers of 'Kuwait and Mohamnerah, in return for their help to her 'during her invasion of Iraq, not to levy any land taxes 'on their properties. This^state of affairs, the said 5)aper goes on, continued to exist up to the end of 1927, 'when the Iraqi Government found out that it was detrimental 'to their income and that they were not bound to execute 'a pledge given by another government. They, therefore, 'at once ordered the two Shaikhs* existing properties in 'Iraq to be registered for levying the usual tax on them. 'The taxes due from the said two Shaikhs for the period 'from 1927 to 19SI, when the ^stihlak Law of Taxation* 'was issued, amounted to I.D.30....11 'This is what has been reported by the 'An-Nas' 'newspaper of Basra. 3ome local papers have also quoted 'the news with its defects. As the abovementioned figure 'could not be relied upon, we deputed our local reporter 'to refer to well informed quarters frcm whom he discovered 'that the taxes accumulated against the abovementioned 'two Shaikhs were I.D.25,000 approximately.

KU'i/aI T» 23rd March ,1936• My dear De Gauiy, Reference our conversation of the other day about a Cypher Cleik to deal with your Cypher telegrams and generally to be responsible for maintaining your Cypher files and submitting your Cypher returns etc. In my opinion, and I speak with close on 8 years experience as Political ^gent here, you definitely ou^ht to have such a man to look after the Cypher side of your Office, and I confirm everything that I said to you verbally on the subject* I do not for a moment mean that such Cypher Clerk should be mixed up with your Head Clerk - the latter would, as heretofore, manage the office and your confidential correspondence, and keep your confidential files up to date and in order, work which now takes up all his time. I would again remind you that as things are at present, when a crisis arises, and the Political -u ent wants to keep a cool head and perhaps bring a calm judgement to bear on a nasty problem, the telegraph wires straightway begin to buzz and long messages and instructions (almost always in double cypher) begin to pour in one on top of the other from London and Bushire, which immediately have the effect of preventing the unfortunate P. a . from doing his job, and doing anything in the thinking line, let alone discussing matters v.l th the Ruler etc. etc. or visiting scenes he ought to be doing. Very good examples of what I mean, were the -akhwan troubles of 192 9-30 leading upto the surrender of ill Duwish - Date Garden questions when things first flared up, and comparatively recently Blockade and smuggling crises* Nor must I forget the Oil crisis when Traders tried to enterenter the field, and upset the whole carefully built up apple cart, just before the Kuwait Oil Company got their concession* On these occasions I as P. xl . ought to have been anywhere, but where I was - spending my whole time decypherlng and encyphering lengthy and more often than not unnecessary telegrams• Oftei. too, while still struggling to decypher messages, further messages ij&amp;rked important or priority, would arrive, asking why I had not replied to points of the telegram I was still trying to decypher - truly a pathetic state of affairs* Of course chaos often resulted,!, the P.ii.. , got rattled, and G-overnnent did not get the best of their nan on the spot, or even properly considered answers at times. In actual fact, I always got my wife to come to my rescue and I even trained little ^ahra (11 years old) to assist - the latter became quite proficient latterly in every kind of Cypher as well as in typing them out- You, however, have not ot a wife and child and I makitain that turning ones wife and child into G-overniier.t Cypher Clerks is decidedly wrong in principle, nor is it fair to use them for many hours on end on such vork, as I hove been obliged to do at times Just to keep the show from breaking down* It is quite true th£ t I asked for and was iven permission to make use of the ^uarmtine liedi cal Officer (Greenwa:) for Cypher work, but a he has had to meet on an aver' e 3 steamers weekly as v/ell as 4 Xiiperial airways planes, and on top of all /inc. time to do the work of the Charitable Dispensary, I foun«. in practice that he as never available when he was wanted '?or my work* As you know it is a day's journey to get out to steamers here and he could not be lightly taken from % uaranti ne wo rk * Greenway then can be eliminated thereio-'e, for he has not the time to give assistance of any practical■ practical value 'v^iere Cypher messages are concerned, I have in the past made several efforts to ~et cypher assistant ^ but I fear without avail» I admit my tries have bean made verbally, because I found it useless ever to ask for anything on paper until I had been able to make my case clear by verbal argument first. In the matter of the Cypher Gleik I always failed dismally, because foresooth I had been given a Second Cleik once 'as a reat concession', and that was considered enough. The fact that work had increased out of all proportion or comparison, sine I took over from More, my predecessor, never seemed to cut ice and I simply had to carry on as best as I could, though definitely in inefficient manner. The above are my views, i and I repeat them to you in writing. I may add for your information that I raised the matter with Laithwaite when I was last in England three years ago. The latter promised to tackle ifowle when he returned from Ireland - whether he did or no I cannot say. Yours ever, Sd.

The troubL in Kuwait lies with a batch of false retinue, and the people of Kuwait are, indeed, afflicted witl. a company of dispersed fugitives, ^o nation has ever been overwhelmed by the influence of such a retinue of irresolute profit-seekers, but had lost her ascendancy and declined to a state of confusion and embarrassment. Yesterday arrived in aw a it certain ^ionist agents showingly to discuss with its O-overniient the export of fish from Kuwait to Palestine, at a time when this had been d nied them by other w^rab countries. Having realised that 1 they were in a Muslim country, the spirit of ./hose populaticn abounded with reli.p.ous zeal and aroused ^r^b sympathies, these agents preferred to work in darkness in ord3r to succeed in their suspicious project. They, therefore, made their relations firm with that youth who has been casfc out by his own country and liss come to Kuwait in order to class himself among the retinue of profit-seekers. This ignorant youth almost drove the Government of Kuwait into an infamous problem, for absolution from which all Iluslims had resorted to ^od. Having taken notice of these evil plots the people of Kuwait at once realized that there lay hidden behind the misleading export of fish a terrible scheme of weapon smuggling by these ^ionist agents to their accomplices at Palestine . Ths; , thErefore, rose to their Grovemiicnt , refusing that latter should spoil the good name of their town, and decided that the\ should bury the incident In its craddle at anycost* At this point the Jmir perceived the serious consequences of such an i-licit ac ion and .»as taken by the latent Krab magnanimity. He, therefore, overthrew the project and the a^cvementioned agentsabovemeutioned agents returned in great disappointment. To -ie £u\.f.;it brethren who possessed this hi£:h spirit of -*rab mgnanimity, I said: 'w Q s it not right that you should have brought to the notice of the authorities among you the plots of tkose who attached themselves to them and adhered to them for nothing but the achievement of their own desires and illicit material gain, seeking it wherever and however it is to be found, and then they care for nothing but to despise you and those presiding over you . *lou are right', they replied, 'But nothing could avail in the case of these strangers.

T e havo th^ honour to be, Sir, Your Most Obedient Servants ALIMCKAlJfiD ^A WCGLBHAI .Cirf &lt;r ^ dji —^ IfAS' (1 P akit X -w Exclusion of prosperous Indians from Kuwait , P.R. Re our discussion on which you asked me to mahe a note,the main points appear to be as follows. ( The Sheikh wishes to keep out prosperous Indians desirous of setting iip as merchants because he is afraid that,owing to their ability to live more cheaply than his own people and to their greater business j japacity,they will drive many of his own merchants out of business. Moreover,much of the profit that the Indians would make they would remit home , I, Indians are being driven out of Iran and Irao and are therefore keen to try their luck in Kuwait. This problem has not come up before because it is only recently that exclusion of Indians has became a serious part of the policy of Iran and Iraq. . No obstacles are placed in the way of Indians desiring to go to Bahrain, iuscat or the Trucial Sheikhdoms .Although Bahrain may be regarded as in a different category,the Truciai Sheikhdoms are to a certain extent analogous ] to Kuwait,being like it relatively undeveloped and having a half-settled, half-nomadic population;the capital which Indians have brought into these states has been useful and might also be so in Kuwait .Against this it may be argued that Kuwait has no need of Indian capital,as there are ample resources accumulated from pearling,boatbuilding and boat-sailing,^11 of 'hich activities are on a vastly greater scale at Kuwait than on the -Hicial Coast,and that in any case Kuwait would probably lose ton the balance ,as the Indians would remit most of their profits home to India. - The proposal to exclude Indians from Kuwait is from one point of view not altogether fair,as the Indian taxpayer pays half the expenses of the Agency (the other half being borne by K .M.G.) and the Sheikh owes his ^dependence to the British protection which necessitates these expenses, fn the other hand it may be argued that H.-'.G and the Government of India cannot have it both ways, and that, if it is announced to the world that the ^eikh is independent,then,in matters which do not affect any vital BritishW interests,he should be allowed a certain amount of scope in the exercise this independence,even if his policy is harmful to individual British T , ^dian subjects. ' J '-t is not in the interests of H. .G- and the Government of India that there should be internal trouble in Kuwait,and clearly an influx of Indianjuld be liable,! or the reasons given in paragraph I,to lead to trouble to r : discontent with the Sheikh's rule. It may be argued from the Sheikh's point of view that since Indians are lov/ed to go to all the other Gulf states and are apparently useful thppe lose who are now leaving Iran and Iraq might very well go and Join their sllow-countrymen in these states.The objection would presumably be that e far as Indian immigration is concerned saturation point has been reached. ie admission on the Indian side that the possibilities of immigration are pt unlimited would suggest ttix. a possible line of compromise; the Sheikh to imlt a limi ed numoer of Indians and then to declare that saturation point id been reaci od f lie would argue against this that he already has some Indian his state and that saturation point has already been reached. In ooint of 41 ^ act there are probably not much more than half a dozen Indians in Kuwait. Another possible compromise is that the Sheikh should allow a limited iber of Indians to enter his state but should at the same time decree that Indian should carry on business without xhk an equal Kuwaiti partnet. tnout altogether excluding Indians this would render their activities iss harmful and reduce the potential drain of money out of the state. Whatever solution is adopted,it will be necessary to remenuer that, may be given iccording to the existing Foreign Office rules visas for Kuwait/without reference to the Political Agent,and that it will bo possible for Indians :o 6 e t visas for Kuwait from the Indian passport authorities or from onsular Officers who have not been specially warned,unless provision is : -£e to stop up this loop-hole. {Ml JUwZ - y y/ &gt;■ w ^ L u cCONFIDBNTIALf POLITICAL AGENCY, (f O &gt;!&lt;■ No.C-254# KUWAIT.

ABOUT ARAB KINGS AND RULERS* ^ IP. THS RIGHTS OF PAN-AEUBISM'^^' ^ . THE DDTIBS OF COURTESY. -oOo- This newspaper was kind en oughto publish my article under the title: •Ifalse Reports on Arab Rulers Spoil the Arab Cause^, which I wrote in connection with what had appeared in a Basra newspaper of the lies forged by a writer against one of the best, most patriotic, most considerate to the rights and duties of Pan~Arabism, and most concerned about the independence of his as well as other Arab countries, of our present Arab Rulers, namely His Highness tl the Grand ISmir•Ahmad Jabir al Sabah, the 2mir of Kuwait and its Sovereign# The writer maintained that His Highness the Emir intended to agree with a party of Zionist emissaries on a monopoly of the catch of fish round the coasts of Kuwait, to be supplied to the Jews of Palestine and was about to sign a monopoly agreement had the people of Kuwait not risen in his face and compelled him to give up the idea. There is no one more daring in falsification and lie forging than this writer in what he said against the Smir of Kuwait, as the fact that a Greek party tried (without success) to monopolize the fish catch in Kuwait, indicates the Emir's kind dispositions, excellent patriotism and far-reaching patronage to what Pan-Arab ism dictates to its sons in all countries upon Earth, as I have pointed out in my previous article with decisive proof and conclusive argument* His HighnessHis Higliness rejected the proposal of the monopolistic party, merely because he suspected that the intention of the monopolistic Greek Company was to supply the fish to the jews of Palestine, in spite of the Company^s generous terms and the advantage that would have accrued to the G-overnment of Kuwait# In acknowledging my indebtedness to your bright newspaper for publishing my article, out of consideration for the service of Truth and in fulfilment of the common obligation to the great Arab Cause, I should like to throw more light on certain points that I have outlined before: I have lately come to know from a reliable source that the monopolistic party offered to His Highness the Emir a cash amount of £•10,000/- and a warrant he could confiscate the amount should they fail to observe the term that none of the Kuwaiti fish should be supplied to the Jews of Palestine# This offer they have made In order to persuade him dismiss from his mind the suspicion that had caused his refusal# But he sent his private Secretary to convey to them his final word of refusal with a kind hint in consequence of which they left Kuwait# I should like to add that forgery against Arab Rulers, in matters connected with the Arab Cause In general, as the Basra newspaper had ventured to do, would injure the author, not to mention the confusion it would cause to the minds# No one considerate Arab individual has the least advantage in giving an impression about the sons of pan«Arabism, especially Rulers among them, which is in the farthest contrast with truth and reality# If there happen to be an irresponsible man, who 9 for an end in his mind, finds pleasure in forgery against the ^reat Arab Personalities and leaders of thought in Arabia, ^ man whose refractory soul cannot be restrained by morality or compunction, as Is the case In the forgery made by the writer In a Basra newspaper against His Highness- 3 - His Highness the aair of Kuwait, it is the duty of newspaper editors in all Arab countries to reject such seditions writings against Arab Rulers^ If, however, any newspaper would neglect this duty y the Press Censors in each country should keep awake against such matters; and if the obligations of pan-Arabism would not impel them, they should at least observe the duties of courtesy and the privileges of neighbourhood. Had those in charge of Press censorship in Bagdad warned the •Iraqi newspapers to the duties imposed by propriety towards His Highness the Smir of Kuwait, none of them would have published such matters as had appeared in the 'An Nas n newspaper of Basra, about His Highness the abovementioned Smir, which had the worst effects on the minds of Arab people in all Arab countries. May everyone be cautious of committing such an evil; and well would do the authorities concerned, if they should take notice of what the duties impose in this serious and deeply effective question.

Exclusion of prosperous Indians from Kuwait I discussed this question at cons iderable^ength with the Political Agent. 2. The Shaikh is, I understand, very much against letting Indian traders enter Kuwait as he fears their competition against his subjects, which may lead to economic and political difficulties. There is also a customs preference in favour of Indians in tnat they pay 4^ under Treaty and others pay 0%, Though of course this could be reduced by Shaikh, the extra is levied for public purposes such as Education, which would give an handle for an outcry if owing to our pressing for the entry of Indians, the levy had to be discont inued . In discussion our strong point which is protection could be met by the challenge of what have we done over the blockade, date gardens and incursions. 3. 'Vhat we need is a reply to questions in the Assembly or by Congress. This is afforded (aj by the fact that the Kuwait Oil Company are bound, so far as is consistent with efficient of the Shaikh or British subjects, (b) by the fact that under that Agreement already (1.10.36) 33 Indians have been brought to (c) by the fact that there are already 32 Indians (and two Arab-Indians) in Kuwait, of whom one is a general merchant, one an hotel-keeper, six are tailors and small shopkeepers. The remainder are servants, medical men of sorts, old clothing carry ir^ on of the Under taking, to employ subjects merchants /2- merchants and so on, (d) by the Shaikh's reluctance to let in more merchants as they enjoy a preferential tariff under Treaty. 4. As regards the ind ividualcase, I think that the Iwuy thing to do is to wait and hope that the appli- k cant will not pursue the matter. t L .10.36, Copy given to the Political Agent, Kuwaitv/ No. 659/3/36 British Legation, Tehran 9 10th iX:tober f 195 Copy to: Colonel Loch Dear Toud # I enclose a copy of a letter from an India called Allmohancd Dawoodbhai, who has recently been ^pemission to fo to 'ov/eit # very good reasons for refusing this nan perniscion to go to Koweit # and if they did not want him # it is no business of ours« Nevertheless it seems prina faci6 f a bit hard that the applicant should not be allowed to go to Koweit even to have a look round, and in these days* when life is difficult for Indian merchants in this country, if an applicant nust be turned down, there is something to be said for making the turn down a sympathetic process.

Khan of Mohainmerah, to partake of their father's property without delaying for the distribution under Shara* Law. 2. They decided late on the 4th to make a dash the next morning from Basra for Kuwait intending as their elder brother Ghasib believed, to sell or raise money locally on the movable property of the late Shaikh and possibly seize the arms mentioned in the telegram and letter to which I refer above. 3. They chose for their journey a 12 cylinder Buick car in which they probably hoped to outdistance any pursuers by several hours. Chasib hearing of their intention very sensibly stayed to obtain from the late Shaikh^s Agent in Basra, Khan Bahadur Mirza Mohammad .ahmad of Basra, who holds power of attorney for Ghasib and a number of the heirs, a letter to the Political Agent seeking his good offices in the matter. He was able to set out after his brothers only a few minutes behind them, at the start, out in a Chevrolet oar«- 2 - The Buick was driven here at break neck speed, as I well know since it passed me as I was entering Kuwait early on the morning of the 5th but only an hour or so later Ghasib arrived at the agency, having established a record for the Kuwait-Basra road and hastily presented to me his lawyer^ letter, a copy of which I attach. 4. Eis Jlxcellency the Juler was absent on a hawking expedition and I therefore sent for and haoded the letter together with a letter also attached, to his Secretary, reminding him verbally at the same time that the export of arms was in particular a care of yours under the agreement for the suppression of arms trade. 5 # Ghasib returned to Basra on the 5th and his brothers on the 7th^ having confessed themselves to local acquaintances defeated by Chasib and without,as far as is known to His Excellency,having removed any property of the family.

A pro'blem has appeared as to the boundary line 'between Iraq, and Kuwait due to the pressure 'brought 'by Customs Police ^he smugglers ^i^om Kuwait, T tj is evident that this pressure has resulted in putting (nearly) a stop to smuggling, which (naturally) does not harm the Kuwait Government, Complaints n ^e, wherefore, made that the Customs Police are encroaching upon Kuwait 'boundaries. The Pritish representative is taking Kuwait side and is sending protest after protest. Kuwait which was a part and parcel of this country, and which until the last day of the Othoman reign in Iran was considered a Qadha (district) attached to the Basra Yilayat, is today 'putting it across us' and demanding that we fix a boundary line between us. Our friends the English (i.e.British) are helping in the fulfilment of this demand, ''he news which we have written so hurriedly has something 'behind it. The Kuwait affair which concerns us a great deal cannot 'be described in a small space, and, therefore, details will appear under a special column in our further issues.

It began on the 11th January, on which date, returning la te from a tour in the hinterland, I found the agency Head Clerk waiting to tell ms that ^bdul i.iuttalib, a British subject, had, in my absence and contrary to the provisions of fte Kuwait Order-in- Council been arrested by the local authorities. The charge was that of selling cat in his restaurant Instead of mutton. I lost no time in securing his release, half an hour after my arrival he was out of the Kuwait prison, and temporarily detained by me in the ^ency. Sarly the next morning the Huler called on me and apologised for the error in procedure. No one could have been blander. Just £ s he was leaving me he asked if he should send me a letter about it. I pHun 'ble Lt.-Colonel P.C.Fowle,C.B.3. , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.BUSKl.-tji:.- 2 - I sail, f, No Tt , and that I quite unaerstood the case; I /ould send to his Town Lieutenant for the witnesses and investigate, ivll seemed well. ■ Later in day, however, a letter came fran the bht ilch laying out the evidence in an apparently ingenuous way; the final statement being that the Kuwait 77atch had visited the nan's house and found a herd of ei^it fat cats there. The letter concluded with a request for the man's deportation. 2. His Excellency or his officers had thus in effect tried, and convicted the man and I was to be merely his executive official for the deportation. This would not do. I sent for the bhaikh's Town Lieutenant and said that I should tiy the man the follow ing day at 5 o'clock p.m. and requested the witnesses at that hour, handing him a letter to the Shaikh to t&gt;ie ech.ie etfect. a/ing sometime previously observed an unusual number of cats in the Lieutenant's own house I sharply asked him how many he himself kept. Quailing ■ 1 ' ■ i^ ^o-it -o ur ueen, , i t h those in the haram'* —• as if the latter were inedible. He left apparently ''as good as gold'. ^11 seemed to be well. 4. At this point her ever His Excellency went off hawking for several days, ^t the time I thought itHi - 3 - &lt;0-0 I thought it suspicious. I was right. At ^ p.in. the l '.xlowing day I was informed by the Tovn Lieutenant ana the Shaikh^ Secretary that the witnesses in the c^se could not be produced at 3 p.m. without the Shai.dh's order - and the ohaikh v;es away . ? We are so sorry', th^ said. ^ ^ told the -ieutenant and the Secretary, confirming it in writing, that at o p.m. I should try the man in any case and, as arranged. I could not keep him longer detained without at least an investi -- ation. At o p.m. precisely, I Ix d the man brought be .ore me end in the absence ct witnesses, dismissed the case; writing ajnote to the Ruler, politely but firmly requesting other arrangeLxents in future when f way, * The next day the Ghaikh informed me that a -l- L wi L-nesses had come at 3 p.m.j quite ignoring his secretary's refusal in any circumstance, and as late as 2 p.m. the day before, to send the witnesses in his absence. 1 wrote to him the facts. vhe town had meanwhile been divided into two parties, for and against .ibdul Luvtalib. I visited rather publicly the restaurant and equally publiclylO - 4 - pablioly cut the Ivlayor who brought the case. This hint of action brought over the majority, ever anxious to be on the winning side, to iibdul Ivluttalib t s party. Ifor tunr. teiy, owing to his pt.st charity, it included the Ulema. Opinion being about equally divided and the Ulema and conservatives against them, the local authorities began to drop their interest in the case. Indeed there was nothing much now they could do except to be tro able some about delivering the key of the restaurant to the man. I soon obtained it for him. 7. I should add that the American Mission bad entered the case with their habitual elan. Dr.Mylrea analysed a hair found by the I.Iayor on a table in the restaurant, and certified it to be the same as that on a dead cat from a dustbin in the neibourhood. In the absence of all other witnesses this evidence, to the chagrin of the Ilission, held, I felt, no weight. 8. xibdul Muttalib has decided that his business is bound to suffer frou the accusation ana is now winding up his affairs with a view to departure this week. 9. Thus ends wlx t was knov/n while it lasted as the Kuwait Cat's meat crisis, ana which at one time threatened to be rather serious. 10./.0. As far as I can make out the case arose through tne auioi tions of the iiayor to imitate his predecessor in acquiring a restaurant. He made the error of attacking a British subject because he thought -oreingers easier game then Kuwaitis, and because the Ruler, having weakly concealed the provisions of the Kuwait Order-in-Council from most of his subjects, he did not realize that he would in the end encounter me. -e was aided by Sheikh Abdulla Jabir, the Town Lieutenant, an ambitious, jealous man who plays on the Shaikh's weakness, and who seems to be taking a rather more prominent role since his visit to Baghdad last -j-utumru itTs/^ Confidential, Office of the iolitical Reeident in the Pereian Gulf, p f O.^o^c/125, Caap, Bahrain. Bated the 5th May, 1937. Incident vAiioh occurred some t Ine a^o at Kuwait, which waa duly reported to me by de Oaury, and which can go down to hietory ae 'The Kuwait Oat'a-meat Crisie' has ■ome rather unusual features, which i»y be of interest to put on record. 2. (fee day when de Oaury returned from a tour in the hinter land, he found that Abdul Wuttalib, a British subject, had, in hi s absence, and contrary to the proTlsions of the Kumit Order in Council, been arrested by the local authorities, the charge ' l * fc on * 0:f 8e l 1 - i ''g oat in his restaurant instead of mutton. 3. de Oaury lost no time in securing J&amp;Utalib'a release and the next morning the Shaikh called on de (Jauxy and apolo t is- ed for the error in procedure. Later in the day a letter was received from the 3haikh glying the evidence against Muttalib, the most aerioua itaa of which *i. that the Kuwait Tatch had visited the man's house and found there a herd (or covey, or whatever ia the correct term) of eight fat cats. i 1 he letter concluded with a re ^ueat for the ma^s deportation. 8. A« de Oaury points out the Shaikh or his officers had :h . m effect tried and oonricted the sian and he {de Oaury) waa to be merely his executlTe official for the deportation, his of course de Oaury could not agree to. He sent for the Shaikh* a / V.R.Hay, 0.1.75., Deputy Secretary, S*ternal Affaire Department, Simla.Shaikh's Town Lieutenant ani informed hia that he would try Muttalib the following day at 3 p.w. Under what Section of the Indian Penal Code the aan could be tried is a nice point. Poaeibly Section 415 (Cheating) Might apply. Section 273, (noxioua food), would hardly be applicable, since cata-aieat, though not to erery one^ taste, cannot be held to be ^unfit for food*. 6. Before de Gaury's interview with the Town Lieutenant closed, de Gaury having previously observed an unusual number of cats in the Lieutenants own house, scored a shrewd point by sharply asking him how many he kept himself. failing, the Lieutenant answered 'about fairteen, with those in the haram 11 , and left hastily. 7. The next move in the case was that the Shaikh went out hawking # and at 2 p.m. on the next day de Gaury was informed toy the Town Lieutenant that the witnesses in the case could not be produced at 3 p.m. without the Shaikh's orders, and the Shaikh was away. de Gaury quite correctly confirmed his previous message that he would try the rjin at 3 p.m., and at that hour had the mn brought before him and - in the absence of the witnesses • dismissed the case. ^ fler i can i i n 31 on, for some obscure rsason, took up the ease i»ith oon Sid arable elan, nr. Mylrea playing the part of the local Aerloolc Holmes, or rather Or, Thorndyke, and - analysing a hair found by the Town Lieutenant on a table in Sfuttalib'e restaurant - certified it to be the same as that of a dead cat in a dustbin in the neighbourhood, de Oaury correct ly, to the chagrin of the tfiasion, decided that this erldence could not hold weight. 9. /»3- 9. The ?o*n had meanwhile been d I t idea into two parties - for and against Abdul Muttalib. In fayour of Huttalib were the TlleiBa t owing to hie paet charity, and the local authorities gradually dropped their interest in the case. 10. The affair was apparently engineered by the feyor of Kuwait who t wishing in his prirate capacity to set up as a restaurant keeper # proceeded to sweep a possible riral from his path by spreading the base calumnies already referred to. It as would seem not improbable that the Mayor haid/his confederate in this sinister affair no less a personage than the Town Lieutenant, whose attitude throughout was certainly open to suspicion* He admitted y for inutance 9 the possession of no less thun fourteen cats, surely a large number for a single household, even including the quarters for his wives, and with these as , oapital t the Mayor and himself could doubtless have started a flourishing business in the restaurant line. 11. Iluttalib himself although officially cleared decided that his business was bound to suffer from the base accusations which had been made against it, wound up his afff irs ana departed from Kuwait, whether with or without his eight cats is not known* I am sending a copj of this letter to Cleuson and Stewart* c -rt ) ' A » sent under Printed letter No .C /126 of 5th May 1937. ■ i</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001df_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/506</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001df</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/506</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 53/32 V (D 128) Kuwait Miscellaneous'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1937</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-08-28T10:42:43</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (235 folios)</extent><extent>File is arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of the file to most recent at end.An index of the topics discussed in the file is included on folio 1B.Serial numbers refer to entries in the notes at the rear of the file: red for incoming, blue for outgoing correspondence.</extent><extent>Condition: A bound correspondence volume.Foliation: The file's foliation sequence commences at the first folio and terminates at the back cover; these numbers are written in pencil, and can be found in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.The file contains the following foliation errors: 1, 1A, 1B and 1C; 112, 112A, 112B, 112C and 112D; 121 and 121A and the following omissions: 65; 179-181</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence related to a number of different topics (all of which concern Kuwait).The majority of the correspondence in the file discusses anti-Kuwaiti newspaper articles printed in the Iraqi press.
