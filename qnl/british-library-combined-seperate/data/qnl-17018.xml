It is noted that he has attempted to obtain the sum requested, but that the merchants of Bushire claim that they are unable to supply such a large amount at the exchange rate they have previously provided; it explains that the Acting Resident is currently holding out in the hope of obtaining a more favourable rate of exchange than that currently offered.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023685574.0x00009e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
