The Sheikh wishes to keep out prosperous Indians desirous of ott«A«-^ up as merchants because he Is afraid t' at,owln£ to their ability to live more cheaply than his own people and to their greater business capacity,they will drive many of his own merchants out of business. Moreover,much of the profit that the Indians would make they would remit home, 2 . Indians are being driven out of Iran and Iraq and are therefore keor to try their luck in Kuwait. This problem has not cono up before because it Is only recently t! at exclusion of Indians has breome a serious part f the policy of Iran and Iraq. 3. Ko obstacles are placed in the way of Indians desiring to go to Bahrain Muscat or the Truclal SheIklidoms .Although Bahrain may be regarded as in * different category,the Truclal Sheikhdoms are to a certain extent analo^&gt;rivo to Kuwait,being like it relatively undeveloped and having a half-settled 7 half-nomadic population;the capital which Indians have brought into ther* states l as beon useful and might also be so in Kuwait . ’ gainst this It be argued that Kuwait has no need of Indian capital,as there are amplo resources accumulated from pearling,boatbuilding and boat-sailing,all d\~ which activities are on a vastly greater scale at Kuwait than on the ~ rucial Coast,and that in any case Kuwait would probably lose On the balance ,as the Indians would remit most of their profits home to Indli' 4. The proposal to exclude Indians fro- Kuwait Is from one point of view altogether fair,as the Indian taxpayer pays half the expenses of the Agency (the other half being borne by li.M.G.) and the Sheikh owes his independence to the British protection which necessitates these expense On the other hand it may be argued that H.K.G and the Government of In£* cannot have It both ways,and that,If it is announced to the world that A* Sheikh is independent,then,in matters which do not affect any vital 3r£U- interests,he should be allowed a certain amount of scope in the exercjfc of this independence,even If his policy Is harmful to Individual 3rit*X Indian subjects. It is not In the interests of K.d.G and the Government of India there should be Internal trouble in Kuwait,and clearly an Influx ofwould fee liable,for the reasons Given In ParaGraph I,to lead to trouble to and discontent wit 1 the Sheikh’s rule. 6 . It may be arcuod from the Sheikh's point of view that since Indians are allowed to go to all the other Gulf states and are apparently woeful thppo those who are now leavlnc Iran and Iraq miGht very well go and Join their fellow-countrymen In these states.The objection would presumably be that as far as Indian immigration is concerned saturation point has been reached, The admission on the Indian side that the possibilities of immiGration are not unlimited would suggest tkK a possible lino of compromise;the Sheikh to ^fc'.rnlt a limi ed number of Indians and then to declare that saturat\on point had been reached,He would argue against this that he already has come Indian in his state and that saturation point has already been reached. In point o^ fact there are probably not much more than half a doz.cn Indians In Kuwait. 7. Another possible compromise is that the Sheikh should allow a limited number of Indians to enter his state but should at the same time decree thcT no Indian should carry on business without aan an equal Kuwaiti partnei?. Without altogether excluding Indians this would render their activities less armful and reduce the potential drain of money out of the state. 8 . Whatever solution is adopted,it will be necessary to remem er that, may be given Aiccording to the exlstin. Foreign Office rules visas for Kuwait/without reference to the Political Agent,amd that it will be possible for Indians to c e ^ visas for Kuwait from the Indian passport authorities or from Consular Cffloors who have not been specially warned,unless provision is made to stop up this loop-hole. HNote. Exclusion of prosperous Indians from Kuwait. I discussed this question at cons id erablelength with the Political Agent. 2. The Shaikh is, I understand, very much against letting Indian traders enter Kuwait as he fears their competition against his subjects, which may lead to economic and political difficulties. There is also a customs preference in favour of Indians in that they pay 4# under Treaty and others pay 5#. Though of course this could be reduced by shaikh, the extra l/» is levied for public purposes such as Education, which would give an handle for an outcry if owing to our pressing for the entry of Indians, the levy had to be discont inued. In discussion our strong point which is protection could be met by the challenge of what have we done over the blockade, date gardens and incursions. 3. '/hat we need is a reply to questions in the Assembly or by Congress. This is afforded i- (ad by the fact that the Kuwait Oil Company are bound, so far as is consistent with efficient carryir^ on of the Undertaking, to employ subjects of the Shaikh or British subjects, (b) by the fact that under that Agreement already (1.10.36) 33 Indians have been brought to BhSaraX- (c) by the fact that there are already 32 Indians (and two Arab-Indians) in Kuwait, of whom one is a general merchant, one an hotel-keeper, six are tailors and small shopkeepers. The remainderraerohants and 8 o on (d) by the Shaikh’s reluctance to let in more merchants aa they enjoy a preferential tariff under Treat./. 4. Aa regards the ind ividual'case, I think that the thing to do is to wait and hope that the appli cant will not pursue the matter. sd.

It be’an on the 11th Janue ry, on which date, returning If to froai a touz^ In the hinterland, I found the agency Head Clerk waiti ng to tell me that ^-bdul Muttalib, a British subject, had, in my absence and contrary to the ,u*ovisious of it 3 Kuwait Order-in- Couacil been arrested by the loc;.l authorities. The charge was U.Lt of selling cat in his restaurant instead of mutton. I lost no time in securing his release. Half an hour after my a rival he was out of the Kuwait prison, and temporarily detained by me in the agency. oariy th*; next morning the Huier called on ma and apologised for the error in procedure, ho one could have been blander. Just fts he was leaving me he asked if ha should t enu me a letter about it. I The TT on*ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle t C.i3. 5., Political Resident in the Persian Qulf2 - I said, 'No”, and that X quite oijjl jrstood tha case; I *?ould sonc to hie Town Lieutenant for the wit nesses and investigate. *vll seetieu well# 2 m Later in the cay, however, a letter caue from the Sbt ikh laying out tij e evidence in an apptrently ingenuous 'fay; the f ii.al stat:inent beiin’; tlifc t the Kuwait Vetch had /i sites the nan's house and found a herd of ei fat oats there. The letter concl ided with a request fai’ th-e man's depoi’Uition. ^ o. His hccellenoy ox* his officers had thus in effect tried, and convicted th&gt;.r nan anc I v.us to be merely his executive offi cial for the depox-tat ion. This would not do. 1 sent for ti e nhsikh's Torn Lieutenant ana sale that I shouln txy the nan the follow ing day at L o'clock p.ia. and requested tie witnesses at that hour, handing him a letter to the shaikh to the same effect. Having sometime previously observed an unusual number of cats in the Lieutenant's own house, I ^inrpiy asked him how many he himself kept, .nailing he said, 'Mbout fourteen, rith those in the horam” - ns if the latter were inedible. He le 't apparently ”as good as gold”. &gt;vll seemed to be well. 4. -vt this point ha ever His hccellency went off hawking for severcl days, -t the time I thoucht it- ^ - r thou^t it suspicious. I was right. 2 p.a. the following dny 1 was informed by the Town Lieutenant anc the Lhaikh’s Secretary that the witnesses in the cnse could not be produced at 5 p.ja. without the ohei.di’s order - ana the LhaiJch was away. ^ *i e are so sorry rt , th&lt;$ r said. 5. 1 tola the Lieutenant and the secretary, i confirming it in writing, that at 0 p.n. X should try the man in any case and, as arranged. 1 could not keep him longer detained without at least an investig ation. At i5 p.m. precisely, I ht d Hie taan brought before me end in the absence of witnesses, dismissed the case; writing anote to the Auler, politely but firmly requesting other arrangements in future when away. The next day the ohaikh infermed me that all the witnesses had comeat 5 p.m.; qpite ignoring his secretary T s refusal in any circumstance, and as late as 2 p.m. the day before, to send the witnesses in his absence. I wrote to him i he facts. 6 . The town had meanwhile bean divided into two parties, for and against Abcul Lutialib. I visited rather publicly tha restaurant and equally publiclypublicly cut th *3 iinyor who brought ti 0 cose. Thie hint of action brought over thu ranjori , ever aiixious to be on tiie wiiUiin .5 sine, to ^buul i^uttelib’s party. ’ortunt. tely, owing to his pt.st charity, it ind ucted the Ulema* Opinion being about equally divided and the Ulema and conservatives against them, the local authorities began to drop their interest In the case. Indeed there ms nothin; mud. now they could do except to be tro iblesone about delivering the key of the restaurant to the man. I scon obtained it for* him. 7. I should :dd that the ; n*? ric-on Mission hod entered the case wi :h their habitual elan* Dr.Mylrae analysed a hair found by the Mayor on a table in the restaurant, and certified it to be the same 1 s that on a dead cat frou a dustbin in the nei#; bourhood. In the absence of all other witnesses this evidence, to the chagrin of the Mission, held, I felt , no weight. 8 . .bdul huttalib h .s decided that his business is bound to suffer from thn accusation anc is now wincing up his affairs with! a view to ueparture this week. 9 . Thus ends wlx t was cnowu while it lasteo as the Kuwait Cat’s meat crisis, anc which at one title threatened to be rather serious.5 / 0 10* As far &amp;s I ctx± ia&amp;ke out the ease arose throu*£i the aiabitious of the J^ayar to imitate his predecessor in acquiring a restaurant. He nade the error of attacking a jjiltish subject because he thought foreingers easier gam than lluwaitis, and because the ^uler, having wealvly concealed the provisions of the -Cu**ait Order-in-Oounci 1 from most of his subjects, he di d not realize chat he woula in the end encounter me. He was aided by Sheikh Abdilla Jabir, the Town Lieutenant, an ambitious, jealous roan who plays on the shaikh’s weakness, ai ]6 who seems to be taking a rather more prominent role since his visit to Baghdad last autumn.No. 0/126 of 1937.

Before de Saury'• inter view with the Town Lieutenant eloeed, de Saury haring previously observed an unusual number of cats in the Lieutenant's own house, scored a shrewd point by sharply asking him how many he kept himself. filing, the Lieutenant answered -about fourteen, with these in the harem *, and left hastily, 7. The next move in the case was that the Shaikh went out hawking, and at 2 p.m. on the next day de Saury was informed by the Town Lieutenant that the witnesses in the case could not be produced at 3 p.ni. without the Shaikh's orders, and ths Shaikh was away. de Oaury quite correctly confirmed his previous message that he would try the non at 3 p.a., and at that hour had the mrt brought before him and - in the absence of the witnesses « dismissed the case. 6. ’he American :Uealon, for some obscure reason, took up ths cast with considerable elan.

I believe that this is not borne out by the facts, and that if we were given time to collect data it would be easy to show that in some cases a very substantial expansion in employment and trade, particularly in Bahrain and Kuwait had taken place. 3. Could you very kindly let me know what you estimate the annual Indian earnings to be in your Agency (a) from employment of all kinds other than that paid for from Government of India funds and (b) business e.g. profits from shops, trade, middle man^ profits, shipping and the actual import of Indian goods. It would also be interesting to know the fluctuation in the number of Indian residents in these areas.\(&lt;? KUWAIT, My dear G-allov/ay, ARABIA . 10th October, 1939. Vuith reference to our conversation concerning the ajTK)iint of rnoney vdiich the Company spends in India and pays to Indian employees per annum the undemoted are the details you require:- 1. Payments by our Agents in Bombay for material purchased, cost of passages of recruitments,etc. Rs. 29,500 2. Payment to Indian employee s in Kuwait including clerks, artizans, cooks, etc. Rs. 86,2i£)0 Of the amount shov/n under item 2 approximately Rs.31,000 is remitted to India in the foim of home payments etc. through our Agent, this figure is not included in the statement of disbursements under item 1. The details given have been arrived at by averaging our monthly expenditure for this year to 30th September. We anticipate that our purchases from India will increase in the near future.1 } Confidential Political Agency, ).0. No. C/388 Kuwait, 16th November, 1939. ’{y dear Colonel, 'lill you please refer to your denii-official letter No. C/240, dated the 17th September, 1939? as 2 . Indian interests in the Persian Gulf, so far Kuwait is concerned, can conveniently bo considered from two points of view, those of the present and the future. 3. As regards present earnings of Indians. The earnings of Indians in Kuwait not in Government service can be estimated at about a lakh and a quarter of rupees per annum. The above figure is made up of eighty-five thousand rupees pail per annum by the Kuwait Gil Company to about seventy five Indian employees, -id will of course increase rapidly as the ?ield Is developed. The balance of the estimated sum is earned by the remainder of the community. 4. As regards shipping and importation of goods from India. It is estimated that the value of goods carried from India by British ships amounted to approximately fourteen lakhs in 1936-37, and in 1938-39 the value had risen to approximately twenty five lakhs. Shipments from India by sailing craft valued three lakhs in 1936-37, and in 1938-39 six lakhs. It will be seen that these figures show a steady rise during the last three years in the value of KUvvaiti-Indian trade, and in addition the Kuwait Oil Company are now spending some Es. 30,000 per annum in India, a figure which will increase as time goes on. 5./ The Hon’hle Lieut-Col. C.G.Prior, crs., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, at Kuwait.5, • The standard of living in Kuwait and its hinterlml has been at a subsistence level since time immemorial, but is now undergoing a fundamental change. The discovery of oil throughout this part of Arabia in quantities that appear at present to be illimitable, modem communications and the settled Government now provided almost for the first time in history have all combined to transform Kuwait rrom what was formerly a place practically devoid of resources into a flourishing port with growing markets in the lands it serves. As this port has always looked to India as its natural market, both for buying and selling, it follows that now its importance to India is greater than ever before afcd is likely to become still more so.
