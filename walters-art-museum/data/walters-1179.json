She is represented as a hippopotamus with a swollen belly, pendulous human breasts, the limbs of a lion, and the back and tail of a crocodile. Taweret was a benevolent deity and was commonly depicted on amulets. Underscoring her function as a protector, she holds the hieroglyph \"sa,\" meaning protection, in each hand, (the cartouches on her shoulders were added at a later date, and have so far escaped a definitive reading). Although her cult gained great importance, she had no temples of her own.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/6873", "Provenance": "Dr. Edd\u00e9, Alexandria, Egypt; Edd\u00e9 Collection Sale, H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, May 31-June 2, 1911, no. 525; Henry Walters, Baltimore, [date of acquisition unknown] by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Dynasty": "Ptolemaic Dynasty", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.11", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.223_3QtrLft_DD_T08.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.223_3QtrLft_DD_T08.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.223_3QtrLft_DD_T08.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.223_3QtrLft_DD_T08.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_22.223_3QtrLft_DD_T08.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "3193", "Images": "PS1_22.223_3QtrLft_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_22.223_Back_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_22.223_Fnt_DD_T08.jpg, PS1_22.223_Lft_DD_T08.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
