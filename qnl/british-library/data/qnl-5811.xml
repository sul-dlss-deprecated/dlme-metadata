The statement made by the Petitioner is too meagre and lacking in detail, to enable me to identify the actual land claimed or the personality of Ali Bhai % T gather moreover from the petition that Turki bin Brahim was not a person enpitled to British Cc6 cuSu,Ljtcr. protection and was not registered^during his visit to this country, Tior does it appear that his jather was so register- ’ In view of these circumstances I am compelled to report that I have been able to ascertain practically nothing likely to be of service to him in recovering the alleged estate of his deceased father % That there is some founda- -tion in fact Jor the petitioner's statements appears to be clear from the concluding paragraph of a report-copy of which I have the honour to enclose- made to me by an official attached to His Britannic Majesty's Court here. The gist of tie paragraph in question coincides with the concluding paragraph of Turki bin Brahim's petition but owing to the lapse of time and lack oj detail it seems impossible to proceed further, The only method of pursuing this claim which would offer the slightest prospect of success would be for the claimant himself to come to Bangkok and here identify both the land and the so called All Bhai and to enter an action for recovery against the lc.tter or anyoiie in possession of the land Such action woula have to be taken in the Court of the nationality of the party sued, but unless the strongest proofs were forthcoming I fear that the jallure of the claimant to press his claims for so many years woula seriouslym 56 riously impair his chances cj' litigating successfully.

The attached papers relate to a case in the Basrah courts in which a Kuwaiti nakhuda sued a Jew who had posed for years in this place as a Moslem and as such had served under him in the pearl fisheries finally returning to fiasrah and reverting to his old faith; and they show that the plaintiff Obtained a decree paying Rs.70 to get it. The plaintiff now comes to me and explains that the defendant has pleaded insolvency and accepted imprisonment in lieu of paying his debt, and objects to this settlement which, he points out, merely means to him a loss of Rs.29 in addition to the original debt. The reply to this would appear to be that it is his own fault, that he should have ascertained that his man was able to pay before proceeding against him, out these people do not undertsand the view taken by the law in regard to personal liability. The plaintiff suggests that it would be more to his interest that the debtor should be released from prison and compelled to work with him until his debt has been discharged. I am not sure how Kuwaitis are now held to stand in rela tion to the Basrah courts, and whether it would be considered necessary to carry out the strict letter of the law in such a case as this. I therefore beg to lay the matter before you. ' i mi j;| r J is: 5#1No. To Political Agent, Koweit. Political Office, Basra, 11th M arch 1916.

I have consulted Senior Judicial Officer and append extract from his observations. Plaintiff having sued in the Court here, he must take his chance under the rules of our procedure and I do not see my way to take action in the matter in the direction desired by him. Chief Political Officer. /£ ^5L 3 V, a: ■? m As r Extract f&lt;’oin a nots^ dated 10th ^arch 1916^ from Senior Judicial Officer, to Chief Political Officer, Basra. x I am afraid I can do nothing whatever. I certainly cannot remit fees nor can I grant extradition for a purely civil claim. The plaintiff has come forward of his own free will and asked for trial. u e has had his trial and the result was unduly favourable to him in my opinion, for, in Mackenzie f s Court or mine, he would have a good deal more trouble and would have been put to much greater expense to prove his claim. If he can point out any property belonging to the defendant, the Courts will attach it and execute the decree pro tanto. for some time they will be ready to do tnis, for the limitation la?/ does not come into active operation, for some time yet. Otherwise, he may have the satisfaction of imprisoning the defendant for six months or until he pays up whichever is less but he will certainly have to pay for him at four annas per diem, for Government will not pay for his keep. jV0n slignt and vindictive satisfaction may be denied him, for though the defendant has not yet presented his peti tion in insolvency, he probably has other debts besides the Nakhoda's which will bring him up to the required R? 500/- and no assets and so would be entitled to relief and a protection order. * x x .

I have examined certain cases from the Basrah Court in which sons of Ahdul ^ziz el Hukhazim. are concerned • The Shaikh of Ku 'ait claims exclusion jurisdiction over these cases. The point taken by the Political Resident, Bushire, is based on the following presumption of facts as set out verbatim^ from letter dated 30th of June, 1928, viz that ‘‘that if a Kuwait subjects file a suit against another Kuwait subject in an Iraq Court bn a purely Kuwait matter (i.e. where the subject matter in dispute and tha defendants „ are in Kuwait and tha cause of action arose wholly in Kuwait ) Iraq Court should decline to entertain the case. * 1 '* There are four cases in Basrah Civil Court and nothing in the 3hara^ Court in which the sons of Abdul **.ciz el Mukhaizim are concerned and in all of them the facts are contrary to the assumption made by the Political Resident for in each case the defendant was in Iraq. (a) Ali bin Abdul Aziz el Kakhaizim filed a case against Saud ibn Abdul ~ziz resy n S Zubair ^or Rs. 1713/8/- In this case the plaintiff was in Iraq, made a Power of Attoreney at Basrah and filed the suit against his brother residing in Iraq who is duly served in -*ubair and attended to the Court. (b) Baud ibn Abdul -*ziz el Kukhaizim the above defendant filed a case against his brother ^li residing at Kubair. Ali was served at -ubair and gave a Power of Attorney at Basrsh to his advocate. This power of attorney states he was residing at Aubair. The case concerns a Hawalla for Rs.4000/- drawn by- 2 - ■HmNkT^ it (c) (d) U l ■ ■ ~ i .. i—T^sr^-——— &lt;-— • 2 - &lt;jaud at Kuwait and payu'ble by -^odul iiaz-.ak ion *ibduilah at -ubair to the order of All ibn Abdul Aziz el kakhaizim. In this case the plaintiff resided at Aubair and the defendad^vas served at Aubair or Basrah and was certainly ^enporarily reside^^t Zubair or Basrah and the suit concerns a sui r i 01 money puid at —ubair, and attachment was ordered on date gardens of defendant in Basrah. A case filed by Ibrahim el Adsani, a resident of Kuwait, who gave a Pov/er of Attorney in Kuwait to file a suit against Baud itfa Abdul Aziz residing at &lt;-ubair . Baud was served at Zubair and attended to the Court. -»o observation is necessary in this case. ■idialid ibn ^aid a resident of Kuwait filed a suit against Baud ibn Abdul ~ziz residing at Zubair who appeared. You will see therefore all these cases concerned as plaintiif or defendant Baud ibn ^*bdul **-ziz and from the records ne appears to have been a resident of ^ubair and was served at Zubair. -*s regards Ali there is no doubt that he was in Basrah and was quite properly served. Prom the letter of the Judge it appears that all these cases arise out of the bankruptcy of Baud ibn Abdul -.ziz , . . V3oJrA&amp;*- el iukhaizim at and in my opinion the three cases were filed against him in Basrah in order to, compel him to pay up more man was recovered and the fourth case is a counter - case filed by him against his brother Ali who v/as then at Zubair^appeared to the summons. The facts reported to the Political ^gent vide his 680 were that Baud and Khalif went to Iraq and filed a suit against -*li. You will see from above thatt there is only one suit against -ali which was filed on a document, true or false, which was payable at Zubair and in which suit this defendent was served at Basrah. e 174 /££} &amp; there seens little doubt that a settlement of the affair of 3aud was made in Kuwait and some of his creditors have ignored that settlesB ent and filed actions against him* I think there- is no doubo chat such actions may be filed in lr&lt; Court as he is a resident in the Jurisdiction ahd has properly in the Jurisdiction of Iraq* Cuyfiousi;. enough the lhaikli fo Kuwaic does not seem to be' interested in the cases against 3aud but is interested in the one, (not two) case against Ali. Whether that case is true or false Ali was certainly temporarily in the Juri diction of Iraq and he was prosecuting his suit against‘3aud and the subject matter of that case concerned money alleged to have been paid in Iraq. The settlement in Kuwait has been pleaded by 3aud and is a legal question for the Judge to consider* The case against «&lt;».li has been appealed. 3d.
