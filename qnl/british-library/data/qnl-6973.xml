Note on the Christian Communities in and around Mesopotamia. (ID.

Sla^ou?^ COmmUni0n With the ROman Cath0liC CllUrcL I. are divided into the following three classes : (а) Gregorian. (б) Nestorian or East Syrian. (c) Jacobite or West Syrian. II. are divided into :— (a) Armenian Uniate. (h) Chaldean (East Syrian Uniates). S Maronites 1111 ^ 468 (WeSt Uniates )' officiall y 'ailed Syrian Catholics. B. i¥iZ/.eS«—These Churches were recognised as by the Turkish Govern ment each with its civil head appointed by the Government, though in practice the 5 if i? rC n wa , s chosen - 14 is believed that aU enjoyed this privilege, though the official handbook only mentions I. I. (6), I. (c), and II. (a) as C. Geographical Position :— I. (a) are to be found in Armenia and Mesopotamia. They have three ' Catholici' m theory the chief of whom is at Echmiadsin, near Erivan. They have also a patriarch (a rank which m their Church is counted lower than Catholicos) who resides m Constantinople for governmental business. The Catholici of Sis and Akhtamar are merely titulars. The Gregorian Church is the National Church of Armenia. (6) overlap the borders of Persia and Turkey : at Urmia, Julamerk, &amp;c., in the Hakkiari and liari districts of 1 urkish Kurdistan and the Urmia district of Persia. Their patriarch resided near Julamerk in pre-war times. (c) are scattered and to be found in North Syria, Diarbekr, Mardin ; also some in Mosul and Baghdad. They have a patriarch at Mardin and first bishop called Maphrian ' at Mosul. II. {a) Mardin and elsewhere: chiefly in West Kurdistan and south-east Anatolia. Archbishop at Mardin. (6) At and near Mosul; also Baghdad. Patriarch at Mosul. (c) At Diarbekr, Syria, Mosul and Baghdad. Patriarch at Baghdad, Antioch, or Damascus (?). {d) Lebanon. D. History and Tenets :— I. (a) Called after St. Gregory the Illuminator, who converted the main part of the Armenian nation to Christianity between 250-330 A.D. The Armenian Church gradually lost connection with the Byzantine Ecclesiastical organisation and doctrine and became a national Armenian Church. (b) A remnant of the great body of Nestorian Christians who in the Middle Ages were to be found in many parts of Asia. Their doctrine dates back to the 5th century. They were accused of holding that Christ was not one person, but two—divine and human This doctrine was condemned as a heresy at the Council of Ephesus A.D. 431, and its adherents were forced to take refuge beyond the borders of the Roman Empire. They then spread into Mesopotamia and Persia. They were persecuted by Tamberlane in 1400. A remnant lingered in the plains .of Assyria, near Mosul and among the mountains south of Lakes Van and Urmia. In the 16th century the plain-dwellers joined the Church of Rome. Ihey now dwell mostly in the mountains. They deny that they are Nestorians in the heretic sense. 2573 40 10.20(c) These are traced to Jacobus Baradseus (6th century) in Syria and Mesopotamia. They maintained a position near the borders of the Eastern Roman Empiie in spite of persecution by the Byzantine Government. II. (a)-(d) The Uniate Churches are those portions of the independent Churches that have been brought (mostly since the 1/th century) to accept the spiritual supremacy of the Pope. But they differ from the Roman Catholic Churchy and from each other in matters of ritual, liturgy, ecclesiastical laws and customs. Ihey have a separate hierarchy and tend to resent any assumption of authority on the part of the Roman Catholic curia. These Churches are derivatives of the independent Churches. As regards group III. : these fall into two groups : — (a) Protestant converts from I. and II. who were officially recognised as one 'millet' collectively. (b) Secessionists : (i) New Chaldeans. (ii) Orthodox Armenians. E.—The Assyrian refugees of Baqubah, now in the Mosul Vilayet en route for' the Urmia district, are Nestorians or East Syrians, and are being repatriated to districts which may be regarded as their homes. The French interest, as indicated by their notes to the Foreign Office, is professedly in the Jacobites, the majority of whom live west of Jazirat al 'Ufnar. None of these are among the refugees who are being repatriated to the Urmia district or are maintained as refugees on our charge. What Jacobites there may be from west of Jazirat al 'Ulnar in Mesopotamia now are at liberty to return to their homes as they wish. They are in no sense Nestorians as the French seemed to imply in their first note. The refugees are, in fact. East Syrians, as opposed to West Syrians or Jacobites, and originate from areas east and north-east of Jazirat al 'Umar, from districts outside both French and British zones. Their homes were generally between Lake Van, Lake Urmia, and Mosul, in the Hakkiari district of Turkish Kurdistan and in the Urmia plains of North-West Persia (Khoi, Salmas and Urmia). In the summer of 1915 the mountaineer section of Assyrians from Turkish Kurdistan were driven into the Persian districts in and about the Urmia plains, where they joined up with their co-religionists. When early in November 1917 our Russian allies decided to withdraw their forces from North-West Persia, the Assyrians were armed by the retiring Russians, much to the resentment of the Persians. The Persians early in 1918 ordered them to disarm and attempted to enforce their order. This led to disturbances in Khoi, Salmas and Urmia. After a to and fro of fighting with the Kurds, when about the middle of April 1918 a Turkish force was reported to be advancing from the direction of Sujbulak and Ushnu, the Assyrians advanced to meet this force. An initial success at Ushnu was followed by an attack by Persian democrats, who ruthlessly massacred some 4,000 Assyrians settled at Khoi. Finally, threatened by overwhelming numbers and without ammunition, these Assyrians were forced to leave their homes in the Urmia plains and to begin their long southerly march through hostile country to seek protection behind the British, whom they had long expected to come to their succour. It is not to be supposed that they would ever willingly migrate to the French sphere west of Jazirat al 'Umar so long as there is any prospect of their being able to settle in their ancient homes. F.—The ' Millet'' which chiefly concerns His Majestv's Government as man datory Power for the vilayats of Mosul and Baghdad is the Chaldean, i.e. Group II. (6), a progressive body of cultivators and artisans chiefly resident in and around Mosul. They are not to be confused with the Nestorian Millet, whose original homes are outside the limits of French and British mandates.
