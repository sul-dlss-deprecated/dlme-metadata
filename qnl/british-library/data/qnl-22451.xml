Sir, I have the honour to forward, in ori, :iiial ; a representation I have received from Mr.Ghulajn Haidar regarding his leave,and to strongly recommend it, 2. His application for leave was refused by Residency telegram No#199 dated the 26th February 1930, and in Circular Memo No,485 of the 1st March 1930 it was pointed out that six months notice was required. Mr.Ohulam Haidar was unfortunately under the impression that since his leave application had originally been made in September last year, that, thou^i it was refused in your telegram No«962 of October 1929 his application would still hold good for this Spring and since he did not withdraw it, it would appear a reasonable assumption* 3. I regret that I am unable to verify all the statements in I f r«Crhulam Haidar^ application, but there is no doubt that his health has not been good, and he has frequently been excused duty by the Agency Surgeon. I therefore request that his application may be taken as coming under the last para- ^raph of your Circular memorandum, end favourably considered. 4. I request that advantage may be taken of his proceeding on leave to transfer here the 3rd Grade clerk ( (presumably 1 r.Athanasius) to whom we are entitled, and who for some reason unknown to me we do not appear ever to have had I would be glad of a telegraphic reply. 5.

J. Gazdar, Offg* Indian Assistant, Bahrain. ; Captain C. G. Prior, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain, Karachi• Sir, I have the honour to submit this application for favour of transmission with such recommendation as you may deem fit to the Hon'ble the Political iicsident in tj.iC Persian Gulf for his favourable consideration. As already submitted in my application dated 20th December 1929 forwarded to the Hon(ble the Political Resident with your Demi Official No. 1804 dated 31st December 1929 I have been bracketted with Mr. Fernandes ever since the grsde lists were started in the Residency. This was due to the fact that the appointment of both of us to the G-ulf service was made on the same date namely, 8th October 1904. According to Residency letter No. 1701 di ted 21st Jul 1930 Mr. Fernandes has be^n posted Treasury Officer on Rs 400- 20-500 plus Oulf allowance Rs 100 plus House rent Rs 50 plus Customs allowance Rs 50. whereas I have been posted as Treasur 25 __ i Officer Muscat on Rs 30CP2~ - 400 plus Gulf allowance Rs 75 per mensem. Brom this it will be seen that although we are both equal in seniority Mr. Fernandes will draw Rs 600 or over whereas I will draw Rs 375 per mensem. Previous to the new schme coming into force the high est paid post ( 1st grade Head clerk ) namely Muscat was allowed to be enjoyed by Mr. Fernandes to my disadvantage causing me substantial monetary loss of pay leave allowance and pension Againu Again. Sir, I became Head Clerk in 1912 and remained Head Clerk till 1st April 1930 chiefly owing to the reduction of one gazetted appointment in the English branch and cresting two more posts in the Vernacular branch. The Munshis and Interpreters who wore appointed when I was Head Clerk got gazetted appointments m ay years before me and drew higher salaries. In the circumstances I request that I may kindly be giyen equal chance for the highest paid post namely Treasur Officer Bushire: that in th. meantime I may kindly be grant ed maximum pay of the post of Treasury Officer, Muscat to recoup in part at least substantial loss I have sustained in pay and leave allowances. Further, Sir, I understand that Mr. Fermndes has appliea for an extension of the period of his service by 3 years. If this extension is granted to him I re uest that I may be granted the same concession as otherwise it 'j.ould affect me adversely and I will be compelled to retire without getting any benefit of the higher pay. I confidently hope that the Hon f ble the Political resident will be graciously pleased to grant me these requests taking into consideration ay long service in this part of the world.

Sir, I have the honour to Torvard for the favourable con sideration of the HoM v ble the Political Resident an application from Mr Gazdar, the Acting Indian Assiotant at Sahrein. Mr Gazdar had an interview with Colonel Biscoe on the occasion of his last visit to Bahrein, and he promised to see what could be done for hin. The point at iusuo then was the post of Treasury Officer at Muscat, and the situation has been entirely altered t^y the introduction of the Reform Scheme, but I feel sure that he will now receive an equally sympathetic hearing* During the time Hr Gazdar has been with me at Bahrein X have been much impressed by his zeal and industry, in fact for the last year he has literally been doing two me^s work, and his services have been Invaluable to me« As the original author of the Reform Scheme I have taken considerable interest in its chequered career, and an alteration which I can least understand, and which. If I may say so with due respect, appears definitely harmful, is the formation of two equal po3ta at Bushire and a much inferior one at Muscat. It is only right and proper that the senior officer of the ministerial staff should receive the highest salary, but the chief result to be expected from the appointment of two co-equal posts at Bushire is that whenever one of the occupants desires to take leave, the Political Agent at Muscat will immediately lose his Treasury Officer,as that official^ claim to nearly double his salary will be hard to resist, even for the shortest periods. Had the second p^st at Bushire and the TreasuryD.O.SO: $ r ■ Qjcu Thest art tht arrang#ra«nta I propose for tht rtlitf of Oazdar. I pointed out to Major Fowl# tilt great difficulty inrolyed in haviu^ any one but the permanent in- cunibent tajcing over the post of Head Clerk at Bahrein, for as you know, though, not staffed as a Treasury we have to do the work of one and in addition have a multiplicity of small deposits accounts ^fhich amount to many throusand rupees, and any sort of an interregnum would only involve me in difficult ties. It is impossible for Gazdar to leave Bahrein the first as that would leave ue with one junior clerk to run the whole ifinglish Offlce t and tho following solution^ which Major ffowle has very kindly agreed to # appears tne simplist. October, The proposal is that DeSousa should leave Muscat by the up mail of the 5th Hovember, (which does not call at Deoai and so will not be liable serious to delay) and reach Baiirain on the yth November* Gazdar leaves Bahrein by the down mail of the I^th and arrive at Muscat on the 17th, DeSousa will hand over th» treasury temporarily to the Treasur accountant, provided there is no insuperable objection to this, and as he is ao«tually working in it he will be con- versant with its details, nor as the period is inside a month will be it be necea^ary for him to send any returns in till Gazdar arrives.

Reference your memorandum No.K-65, dated the 20th September 1930. Mr. D'Souza was relieved at Bundar Abbas on the fore- K noon of the 21st April 1930 and was to have proceeded to * x Mohammerah. The first steamer leaving for Mohainmerah after the 2l6t was on the 25th April ^ut being allowed six days for % preparation in addition to the actual period of Journey by ship in the calculation of his joining time, he could and I presumably did wait for the next steamer which was on the 1st May 1930. Meanwhile he fell ill and the Medical Officer furnished a certificate on the Ist of May recom mending him three weeks medical leave. The leave was sanctioned by this office and was effective from the date « of the Medical Certificate. Mr. DeSouza went to India during this leave and owing to a change in the original postings he was instructed by telegram to report to Bahrain on the expiry of his leave. On reaching Bahrain he received orders to proceed to Muscat. He reached Muscat on the 27th June and took over as Treasury Officer there on the 1st July 1930. The period to be adjusted is therefore from the 21st April 1930 f to 30th June 1930 and the adjustment - according to rules is as follows:- (a) From 21st to 30th April - joining time under S.R.294 or in view of Medical leave taken under S.R.299. (b) From let to 21st May - Three weeks leave on Medical Certificate on average pay.

I have the honour to forward herewith an application I have received from the Head Clerk or this Agency, Mr• L«G» De Souza, Mr De Souza appears to have paid a heavy price for the short leave taken after his illness, and I trust it will be found possible to gfant him somewhat more generous treat ment# I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain#The Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I beg to refer to Residency memorandum No.2284 dated the 3rd October last and to observe as follows (1) Presumption t hat I availed myself of the 6 days for preparation and in the meanwhile fell ill . This, I respectfully beg to point out, is not correct, since, as a matter of fact, I was most anxious to proceed to Mohammerah and was quite ready to leave by the first mail. Fate, however, decided it otherwise, since I fell ill on the 23rd April and my high temperature which remained steady throughout my illness (with variations between 102 and 103 in the mornings and evenings) only registered normal on the 30th. The following day the Medical Officer gave me a certificate recommending me 3 weeks 1 leave to recouperate before taking up my post at Mohammerah. He, at the same time, informed me that he could not permit me to leave my bed for a few more days for fear of a relapse. The leave was, I think, only sanctioned on the 6th and as the mail steamer to India was in port at the time, I was really very fortunate to be able to proceed by her the same evening, arriving at Karachi on the evening of the 10th, which fact I reported to Bushire as also Bandar Abbas. (2). In my previous application - copy attached for your information - B had put up my case with a sanguine hope that I would at least, as a special case, be allowed the Travelling allowance for my journey on leave but as this has not been sanctioned I have only to note, with regret, that the good intentions of Government Servants who endeavour to do their best in the interest of (jovernment are not granted any special consideration. While I am on this question of passage—2— I wouid, however, venture to observe that as my leave was on medical certificate, it would perhaps be possible to reconsider my case in the light of Art.22lA C.S.R. Since S .R.124 under which I am disallowed my Travelling Allowance makes no mention of short leave taken on medical certificate. (3). In re -ard to the adjustment of my leave, I beg to point out that the decision is really a very hard one in my case since by this for the 3 weeks' leave taken I will have to debit my leave account with over 6 weeks( leave. In this sonnection, I would venture to point out that in Appendix No.12 'Memorandum Explanatory of each rule contained in the S.E.' it is stated that S.R.299 expresses the intention of Art.183 C.S.R as recently interpreted . So I take it that whatever kind of leave be taken on meaical certificate the period which has elapsed since handing over charge should be treated as joining time. Even assuming that my interpretation of this rule be not correct, it is really most unfortunate i^ my c^se not to have at least been allowed the benefit of S.R. 302-C• In concluding my observations I beg to request, Sir, that you will be so good as to forward this to the Secretary to the ilon T ble the Political Resiaent in thevPersian Gulf, Bushire, with your recommenaations.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with your Memorandum No:1117 dated the 10th May 1930 and to say that with the introductiaa of the Revision Scheme the Foreign and Political Departments Memorandum No:798-E dated the 33rd 1 ebruary 1925 'becomes obsolete and to request that the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf will be good enough to take the opportunity to approach the Government of India to reconsider the rules regarding officiating allowances. 2. The post of Head Jlunshi at Bahrain is an Upper Division clerkship,but it appears unlikely that an Upper Division clerk will ever be available to fill leave vacancies that occur. The Vernacular office deal with 2500 cases a year of a value of many lakhs of rupees,and the Head l unshi is in sole charge of that office,the Head Clerk only receiving sums paid over to him. The responsibilities of the post are therefore manifest and Rs.108/- paid to the present incumbent^'r^IIafiz,are clearly inadequate. 3. If the Han f ble the Political Resident approves,! would request, there fore, that the Government of India be moved to sanction that the post be one in which the minimum pay of the Upper Division will be payable to the holder if his salary in IKaT the Lower Division be less than^amount. 4. The additional cost to Government will be slight,and the extraextra responsibility incurred by the Second Division incumbent will be suitably reoogQieed.

Fundamental Rule 50(1) and (2) lays it down as a general rule that officiating pay should not be given in the case of appointments on a time scale* 2. To this rule certain exceptions were made, as defined in Foreign and Political Department Memorandum No.798-^ dated the 23rd February 1925, which allowed for acting allowances in certain posts in the case of officiating incumbents whose maximum substantive'pay was equal to or less than the minimum pay of the posts in which they officiated. Accordingly, with the introduction of the revised time scale the only posts in the Persian Gulf clerical cadre in which acting allowances may be drawn are the special grade Head Clerkships end the special grade Eunshiships. 3. Instances of the kind reported by you must be common, not only here but also in India* binder the circum stances and more especially in view of the econoicy campaign new under way, the Hobble the Political Resident does not consider that there is any likelihood of the Government of India agreeing to such a request, and he has therefore decied not to take any action in the matter.

Unless some satisfactory reply has been received by you to the letter that you said that you would write from the confidential office about the post of the 3rd munshi in Bahrein,to P.R.,1 would request you to kindly refer this matter to The Residency that I had the prioi* right, to this post as comaperd with all the new hands.

Dated,the 14th October 1931. Dear Abdul Razzaq, Many thanks for your letter of the 10th October which has just reached tne. I am sorry that you IZ a are unable to find m eye specialist in Bombay and if he does not return in time you might see Sr.Buggan I.M.S, a Parsi Professor in the Grant Medical College,who I found very good indeed. If I were you I should wait till December and then go to Kuwait. It is hardly worth while spending more time than you need in Kuwait if you can get good instructJbn in Bombay. I am glad you have found a law class to start in but do not lose your sense of proportion amidst all these legal niceties. Messrs Rattan Lai &amp; Sohani have produced over 2000 pages of commentry on the Indian Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Regulations alone,all of it very instructive and able but the only result has been that pleaders find more opportunities of delaying cases. In a place like Bahrain all these delicate distincations between criminal force,hurt,assault &amp;c. f mean absolutely nothing to the general public but what they do understand and appreciate is conmonsense and fair dealing. While you are about it,however,take a good look at the Indian Evidence Act. It is very important and rhen you read it jrou will discover that much of the evidence recorded in Bahrain is inadmissible. I will send you questions about the various codes when I get back to Bahrain. I have not got my Law rwC books with me and cannot dig^the parts out here. What they mean by the cost of a •'reader 11 is somebody like Mr. Hafiz who stands at your elbow,calls for the parties,takes the cases away# In short a Magistrate^ clerk. Make themr them give you an experienced hand and it will save you a great deal of trouble. When I first went to the Central Provinces for training my Reader knew nothing bei^g a new recruit and I knew no\ more so it took some time to get % going. I will see what can be done about getting the training charges reduced when I go back to Bahrain. They certainly do seem heavy. On the other hand there is no reason why the United Provinces Government should train Kuwaities. I hope you are having a good time in Bombay. I think it is a poisonous place myself but if you have got something to do one place,no doubt«is as good as another. Yours Sincerely, Saiyid Abdul Hassaq al Razzuqi.

You will see that the school is not working at present hut I think the proposal of the ' nited Provinces Government will be a very gooa substitute and one which will save you a good deal of money and I advise you to accept it. You will notice thajr propose to make you a third class magistrate and munsiff. If you pass the criminal law exam after your first six months I have no doubt they will give you second class powers which will enable you to pet more interesting cases,but in any case you will get the advantage of doing actual practical work and having your oases criticised by a competent magistrate and if you show aptitude they might possibly give you second class powers without waiting for you to pass any exam. You are lucky in that they seem willing to make you a from the start,for they are usually very- reluctant to part with civil powers until officers have passed the civil law exam which,in its turn it is difficult to pass without the practical/experience. If you are not going to the United provinces for some time you can reply through this .gency.

I understood during his first year in Bahrain that Lr,Anwar i-ukhlis Contemplated returning to 'Iraq and did not intend accepting a permanent post since ho was discontented with the rates of pay. He has now apparently changed his mind and is desirous of being considered for the cadre. 3. It will be noted that he wishes to be considered for an Upper Division appointment. I do not consider that he is qualified for this as his Ilnglish is not strong,though he appears to bo very proff'icient in his native tongue. His t- age is 28 years and he is of a suitable social standing for any Agency Vernacular Office. I would request,however,that he should not be confirmed in an appointment in Bahrain as he would find hiraself junior to clerks considerably younger than himself. 4. I understand that the Hon'ble the Political Resident wishes to secure an Arab 1 unshi for his tours. He has had actual experience of i r•Anwar • ukhlis's work in this respect and may care to consider him for such a post.d Copy of an express letter No.F*190-E/31 dated the 2Ctii May 1932 from Foreign, Simla, to Political Resident, BushLe.
