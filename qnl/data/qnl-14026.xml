Snouck Hurgonje, in the second volume of his publication
                           Mekkadescribes the place, as well as the festival of ‘Sittanā Mèjmūnah’ in detail.Much of the foreground, middle ground and background is littered with tents of varying shapes and sizes. In the foreground bushes can be seen and in the middle ground and background pilgrims are grouped together. Hills rise to the right and left of the horizon.In the centre background a white-washed low-lying structure with a central onion-dome can be seen. This is likely the grave of Maymūna. Tradition relates that she requested to be buried at this location, where she married Mohammed.The negative has had hand-work applied, creating a drawing-like quality in places, particularly in the background and middle ground, where the original plate may have been over-exposed.This is the first of two photographs taken from the same vantage point, which form a panoramic view over the camp. The second is X463/8.Inscriptions:Above image, on the right, in ink: ‘VII’Temporal Context:According to Durkje van der Wal in his publication
