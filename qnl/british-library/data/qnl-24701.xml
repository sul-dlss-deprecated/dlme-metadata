No. 514 (Confidential), dated Bahrain, the 26th July 1911. From— -CAPTAIN D. L. R. Lorimer, LA., Political Agent, Bahrain, To— COLONEL P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Mubarak of Kuwait during his recent visit to Bahrain. He is said to have in general preached from the text that &lt;f unity is strength.” The Arabs should be alive to the needs of the day and should combine in working together towards definite aims. At the moment it behoved all Arabs to give their effective support to the new Arab Steamship Company. It is further stated that he strongly counselled Shaikh Esa to resist foreign interference. He should be very careful in the future not to relinquish or com promise any of his rights or powers. He congratulated him on the rising Amara building, and adjured him to keep the landing arrangements in his own hands. He should try to build the pier himself, if necessary, taking a loan from the merchants. Shaikh Esa should take up a strong attitude. The people of Debai had set an example which ought to be imitated. The spirit of Patriotism (wataniyya) was a thing worthy of all praise and on it depended the life and death of the Arabs. When in doubt or difficulty, Shaikh Esa could always look to him for sincere and wise advice. Shaikh Mubarak is said to have taken his host to task for not having pro vided himself, on advice previously given, with a Steam Launch. He had, however, I think to content himself with the answer to which Political Agents are so well accustomed f ‘ I shall think over it.” 2. All this does not call for much comment. The hostility of tone towards British supremacy is unmistakeable ; but it is difficult as yet to predict exactly what practical effect such advice, if acted on, would have. In the questions of the pier and the landing arrangements, it might stimu late Shaikh Esa to make some genuine effort to put his house in order and so to remove justification for foreign interference. On the whole he is more likely to keep to the old path which has been worn by his feet for the last 40 odd years than to break out into activity and expense. As regards his mention of Debai, there is no doubt that the real or imagin ed state of affairs at Debai has for long been much occupying the minds of the Arabs here, who are fain to see in it an augury for the realisation of all their C.S.L, Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment.

Trevor, I.A., First Assistant Resident, in charge of Residency, To— S. H. Butler, Esq., C.S.I., C.T.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla, I have the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No.' 1023, dated the 23rd October 1909, on the subject of the delay to the Hamburg-Amerika Line S. S. “ Galicia ” at Bahrain. 2. I have now had the opportunity of personally consulting Captain Macken zie, and have been able to collect some additional evidence regarding the sale of the over-carried oil by Messrs. Wonckhausand Company alluded to in paragraph 7 of my letter Noi*2437, dated the 26th September 1909, The result has led me to modify the views expressed in that letter. 3. I regret that in paragraph 5 of the abovementioned letter I should have made an erroneous statement regarding the date on which Mr. Bahnson first reported the delay to the “ Galicia I have now become aware that some private correspondence took place between Major Prideaux and Mr. Bahnson beginning on the 31st January 1908. In this correspondence, however, Mr. Bahnson while protesting against the delay does not specifically request that he should be allowed to hire boats himself. This omission on Mr. Bahnson’s part is the more extraordinary for, as pointed out by Captain Mackenzie in paragraph 5 of his letter No^6o5, dated the 18th September (a copy of which was forwarded with my letter No. 2437), Major Prideaux had only withdrawn the standing per mission to hire outside boats granted in October 1906 to Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company, six days before the “ Galicia ” arrived. 4. Enquiries as to the rate at which oil was selling in Bahrain show that at the time of the “ Galicia’s ” arrival medium quality oil was at Rs. 5 per case, but immediately fell to Rs. 4 or below. The fall was due to the fact that Messrs. Gray Paul and Company had a fairly large stock in hand and lowered their rates on arrival of Messrs. Wonckhaus* consignment. A considerable portion of the oil ex S. S. “ Galicia ” apparently sold at Rs. 3-12 to Rs. 4, per case, and its value was declared at the Custom House at Rs. 3-12, per case. At Bushire Messrsi Gray Paul and Company’s books show that the rate in February and March 1008 was from Krans 14.50—Krans 15.50 and for two or three months prior to the arrival of the “ Galicia ” had been as much as Krans 16 to 17. The * Rate at which Residency salaries were cal- rate of exchange at that time Was about cuiated for February 1908 . Krans * 321 per 100 rupees, at which rate the Bushire rates are equal to about Rs. 4-8 to Rs. 4-12 per case. From this it would seem evident that Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company, gained and did not lose by selling the oil at Bushire. This is borne out by the fact that enquiries at Bushire and Bahrain show that no attempt was made to send the oil back to Bahrain. 5. In these circumstances it would seem that Messrs. Wonckaus and Com pany’s claim to compensation for loss of market is not a genuine one. In regard to the claim for demurrage to the ship, I would observe that the Hamburg- Amerika Line claim to be able to land cargo wherever they like in the Gulf and make no attempt to return it to its destination. The cargo for Messrs. Gray Paul overcarried by S. S. “Galicia”, was landed at Bushire and Messrs. Gray Paul were compelled to take delivery of it there and to make their own arrangements to reship it to Bahrain at considerable expense. So far Messrs. Gray Paul and Company have not been able to obtain any redress from the Hamburg-Amerika Company. This being the attitude of the Company it is not clear why the Captain of the “Galicia” should have considered it incumbent on him to stay as long as he did. 6. Another additional fact has been brought to my notice, viz., that the S. S. “ Nerbuda ” (B. I. S. N. Company) arrived at the outer anchorage on 31st2 January and left on the 1st February. Apparently she had not much cargo but a certain number of boats had to be in the outer anchorage ready for her. 7. Thus it will be seen that the landing contractors had to deal with 4 i steamers on the 31st January and 1st February 1908, and as they had only been recently appointed it is not surprising that these arrangements were not equal to the emergency. 8. Taking atl these circumstances into consideration, I am of opinion that no useful purpose would be served by an attempt to arbitrate in the matter and that Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company’s claim for compensation should be rejected. The following appear to be the main grounds on which this would be done ; first the fact that the landing contractors had only been in office for 7 weeks, ancT had not had time to get properly into the work : secondly that they were greatly handicapped by having four ships in harbour on the 31st January and 1st February, a most unusual occurrence, and thirdly that Messrs. W6nck- hausand Company have not adduced any proof that They incurred any actual loss. 9. Lest it should be urged that the British Government have refused to accept the claim because it is made by a German firm and accorded them differential treatement, I beg to forward ’ herewith a statement showing the delays caused to British^ India vessels in Bahrain in 1905, 1906 and 1907. In no case has any compensation been granted for a claim made by the British India Company our efforts have always been confined to endeavouring to force the Sheikh and landing contractor to improve the landing arrangements. At present these arrangements are by no means, perfect, but there has undoubtedly been a great improvment, and there would be more if the merchants at Bahrain would only consent to paying higher rates of landing charges ; at present the rates are insufficient to permit of proper arrangements.

London. October 18th, 1909 Sir:- I am directed by the Secretary of State for For eign Affairs to acknowledge the receipt of your let ter of the 7th instant respecting the claim of Messrs. Wonckhaus against the cargo-landing contractor at Bahrein. I am to state that no action has as yet been taken by the German Government with regard to this case, and that Sir Edward Grey concurs in Viscount Morley* s proposal to postpone a decision in this mat ter till after the issue of the Order in council res pecting jurisdiction over foreigners in the Bahrein Islands. I am Sir Your most obedient humble Servant The Under Secretary of State India Office.MINUTE. * U n../ , / / / , ^ j J ' I &lt; 4. With reference to the position of Foreign European merchants in Bahrein, I learn from Captain Prideaux that the four representatives of the German firm, of which Herr Wonckhans is the principal, are still in the habit, when in conversation with him, of harping upon their claim to extra territoria lity in Bahrein both in regard to criminal and commercial matters. Captain Prideaux considers in fact that they would definitely refuse to go before the Sheikh’s tribunals, and that if we were to say that this majli* with local merchants sitting on it, and the British representative supervising the finding, is a Territorial Court, they would perhaps object even to that. If, on the other hand, we say that the mnjlis is a Court which the Protecting Power in consultation with the Chief has evolved for the settlement of dis putes in which British subjects or Europeans claiming our good offices are concerned, it would seem to afford them an opening for asking us to define our position more precisely. For present purposes I asked the Chief informally at my interview on the 14th insiant to agreeTo that pending any further communication between us on the subject, findings come to by the majlis sitting at the Agency should be considered as subject to modification by the Political Agent in consulta tion with himself, Sheikh Esa, in the event of the European foreigner concern ed not being satisfied with the settlement made by the innjlis. I trust that pending full consideration of the subject, the Government of India will approve of this arrangement. 5. The present position being as described in the foregoing paragraphs, the Government of India will perhaps concur with me in thinking that the question of the administration of justice in Bahrein at the present time requires to be placed on a more precise footing, both in view of the gradual influx of Europeans into the island, and of the modified situation brought about by the appointment of a fully qualified gazetted officer of the superior status to represent our interests.

Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—S. H. Butler, Esq., C.S.I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward a set of papers, of which a list is attached, regarding a claim made by Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company against the Sheikh’s Cargo Landing Contractor at Bahrein ; and shall be grateful if the Government of India can see their way to favour me with their opinion or instructions in regard thereto. a. As far as the details of the claim are concerned the papers forwarded speak sutticiently for themselves, but I venture to make the following additional observations. [The landing arrangements at Bahrein, as at Muscat and else where in these waters, have always been a more or less chronic source of dis satisfaction and difficulty. The native rulers look upon this iiem of their fiscal administration as a state monopoly, and except under compulsion will not allow Individual firms to land their own goods. On the other hand, jealousy between the merchants th mselves does not permit of a firm of repute like Messrs. Gray Paul taking a contract for the landing of cargo because their competitors believe that th^ contractors would manipulate the arrangements so as to favour their own cargo or their own ships. It is con sequently an exceedingly difficult matter to find a satisfactory middle course between— (i) Control by the British Government of the administration of the Customs and arrangements for landing cargo. (ii) Leaving the Ruler to manage in his own way, we doing our utmost to keep him up to the mark. At Bahrein, pending the assumption of more definite control over the Sheikh’s affairs by ourselves, we have endeavoured to get along upon the second alternative course, surmounting difficulties by compromise, as they arise. 3. It will be seen from Major Prideaux’s letter of 27th February Mr. Bahnson, after apparently dropping the claim for nearly a year, after the visit of the German Consul to Bahrein. According to the statements made in the papers enclosed, the discharge of the cargo might have been finished had the ship waited another two or three hours, and having regard to Messrs. Gray Paul’s suggestion that the cargo was overcarried partly because it mostly belonged to them and partly because the market price obtainable for oil in Bahrein had fallen, it does not seem in the first the Contractors’ arrangements were defective and that owing to a combination of circumstances the ‘ Galicia ” suffered some delay. It would be difficult however to press the German claim without also taking up Messrs. Gray Paul’s; if we did, the British India Company, who have to put up with delays of this kind with comparative frequency, at one port of call or appear before the Majlis, and indeed, as Major Prideaux pointed out, it is hardly a suitable case for submission to that body. reference, discuss it with my foreign colleague and endeavour to come to an under standing or compromise, but in tiiis instance a discussion of the case with the German Consul means being drawn into an argument as to our precise position place that the German claim is altogether genuine, although it is admitted that another, would naturally complain of our differentiating in favour of the German Line. Moreover, as adumbrated in paragraph 4 of my letter No. 76 of 25th February 190) (on the subject of the judicial powers of the political administra tion of justice in Bahrein) Messrs. Wonckhaus would in all probability refuse to In other circumstances I should, before troubling Government with a2 in Bahrein, the status of the Majlis, and the powers of the Political Agent, contin gencies which in the present fluid state of those questions would be most incon venient. I feel sure, however, that from their more distant and detached point of view, the Government of India will be able to suggest or indicate a reasonable means of solution, and it is in this hope that I have ventured to trouble you with papers at this stage.

I have the horour to refer to correspondence ending with my letter No. 439, dated the 24th August 1907, on the subject of the cargo-landing arrangements in Bahrein. 2. After reviewing the position from the different points of view indicated in the 3rd paragraph of your letter No I 7 f 4 » dated the 1st August I 9 ° 7 » 1 discuss ed the question fully with the Chief of Bahrein before proceeding on leave last August, and we then settled that if a syndicate could be formed in Bahrein to carry on the work effectively but on the same lines theoretically as previously, such a solution would be the best in the circumstances of the case. 3. During the next few weeks, therefore, the Chief entered into negotiations with various persons, and finally on the recommendation of Haji Muqbil adh Dhakair, our leading Arab merchant, he concluded an agreement with a couple of Ewazi (Persian) Sunnis, who represent a Syndicate of about seven persons of their community, for the performance of the Landing duties, subject provisionally to my approval on return from leave, 4. On my arrival in Bahrein, I learnt t hat the Ewazis were landing the cargo, but that Haji Abdun Nabi had still the charge of the ‘Amaras’ (store-godowns and yards), and that much friction was naturally the result. I also found that the Ewazis had not commenced any steps to purchase boats, and that they considered the promise which they had made to maintain boats capable of carry- ing 5,000—6,000 packages to be unprofitable. The Agreement was therefore3 modified to the form which I enclose in translation for your information, and on u i f T? ri Azv m shawwal 1335 the ' Amaras * were also transferred to the new the last Led day 7th November 1907, &gt; U1C ^ Contractors.

From— CAPTAIN F. B. Prideaux. Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Major P. Z. Cox, Cl E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to correspondence ending with your letter No. 47, dated the Jth January 1908, I have the honour to report that the new Syndicate for the an in &amp; of cargo in Bahrein have caused grave dissatisfaction to the mercantile community last week on the occasion of the visits of the Steamers “ Galicia ' ‘ Waroonga,” and “ Naseri” to this port. 1 cla ’ 2. The Hamburg-Amerika Steamer ■ ' Galicia” arrived at to A. M. on the 31st January 190S with 7,481 packages for Bahrein. She remained about qa hours (leaving at 2-0 or 2-30 P.M.) and over-carried ^,800 packages. The Mail-Steamer “Waroonga” arrived at 4 p.m. on the 'Jist Tanuarv remained 43 hours and discharged ali her cargo, 2,295 packages. 3 J y ’ The Bombay Persian Steamer “ Naseri,” arrived at 5 p.m. 0 n the tst February, remained 24 hours and discharged all her 700 packages. Thus in 55 hours the Landing Contractors received only 7,676 nackapes from the three steamers m the harbour and allowed *,8oo to be overcarried g c x Tl e:: ''I anar i°n for this unsatisfactory piece of work is that while the ■ indicate have acquired the possession of five boats instead of the one owned by their predecessor they have been overchary about hiring outside boats The mfluenual member of the Syndicate, moreover, though well-meaning is in bad health, as he has never properly got over the attack of plague incurredlast spring 4. In the circumstances of the case, I think Messrs. Wonckhaus and Co vou d ave been justified ,n engaging supplementary boats at the Landing Con-' tractors expense in the same manner as Messrs. Gray Paul and Co. did last J unc. I don t think there is any ground for the charge that the Landing Contrac- tors have any desire to boycott the Hamburg-Amerika Line. In far! as one o he 6 i°eTt C h« a 1 hlsTn'r n0 ° n ii the 2nd that he gained to 1-^ V C f b 2? t . s were then a § r ound and that as soon as the tide rose rathpr 11 d a su ^ cient nu mber to clear the ships, I consider that it was ather unreasonable on the part of the Commander of the “ Galicia ” to 20 off without giving the Contractors a chance of complying with this promise Somereasons, which may or may not be true, for this action are suggested in the attached correspondence between Messrs. Gray Paul and Co. and Messrs. R. Wonckhaus and Co. Mr. Bahnson of the German firm has at any rate openly expressed his desire to have the matter quickly brought to a head, and has repro ached Mr. Wills of the British India Steam Navigation Company for not making his representations to the Government strongly enough. 5. The two real causes of the unsatisfactory state of affairs in the cargo landing connection are (1) that the Chief has no official strong enough and honest enough to work the arrangements properly, and (2) that the Arab and Hindu merchants are not whole hearted in striving for a reform themselves, as they will not consent to pay fair wage for the work done. 6. If ever the Sheikh places the management of his customs in our hands it will be easy for us at the same time to put this question of cargo-landing and Amara-storing on a sound basis. Until this time comes, I am not sure that it will not be a wise policy for the British India Steam Navigation Company to follow the lead of the Germans in forcing the hands of the native merchants, by making them take delivery of their cargoes outside of Bahrein, if the steamers are unwarrantably detained in this port. 7. For some time to come now, I believe the landing Contractors will exert themselves to do the work satisfactorily. In these circumstances, and as I under stand that the German Consul in Bushire is likely to communicate with you on the subject of the firm’s complaint, I request that you will kindly instruct me as to the nature of the reply which I should give to the letter from Messrs. R. Wonckhaus and Co. of which a copy is enclosed. Dated Bahrein, the 3rd February 1908. From— Robert Wonckhaus &amp; Co., Bahrein, To—His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrein. We herewith beg to inform you that our steamer ,f Galicia ” has landed only 2,600 cases kerosene out of 6,000 cases and about 1,100 packages general cargo out of about 1,500, the only reason being that the landing contractor did not send enough lighters. The steamer has been in port for three days, ample time to land double the quantity she actually had on board for this port. We consider the treatment we receive from the landing contractor a shame, and this way of landing or, better, not landing our steamers’ cargo is in its result equal to a boycott of our steamers, as on the one side it cannot induce our steamship company to improve their Gulf service as far as Bahrein is concerned, and on the other side it will keep shippers back to ship their goods by our steamers, as all overcarried cargo will be landed at the next port (Bushire) and the shippers have to get their goods back at their own expense, which very often means a heavy loss. By the detaining of the “ Galicia ” in Bahrein for three days and by over carrying about half of our own cargo, losses have occurred to the Hamburg- Amerika Line as well as to ourselves, and we therefore claim from the landing contractor :— Rs. 604 as per specification herewith for account of the Hamburg-Amerika Li n e ; and Rs. 1,700 for ourselves being the loss of profit on the kerosene which has not been &lt; landed. Since we had sold our whole 6,000 cases, we presume our customer will claim from us damages for not delivering the sold quantity as well as our customer or two cases perfumery, which have not been landed either, and we must leave it open to put these claims still before you. Furthermore, we will refer to you any claim the shippers might raise against our Company. It can be no excuse for the landing contractor that the mail steamer was in harbour as we learn that this steamer was delayed as well, and that the British India Agent will put a complaint in too.6 Chiefly the last day (2—2) the landing contractor acted in a most extra ordinary way, by sending nearly all the lighters to the B. P. steamer and not to our boat. When our steamer signalled for more lighters on the morning of the 2nd, we at once informed the landing contractor, who informed us that, up to the , ~ time the two lighters alongside were full, other lighters would have arrived. This was an intentional misleading statement, as about half an hour later we saw personally that the next lighter who was on the way and who micrht have arrived in time went straight to the B. P. steamer, no doubt according to the instructions he had received ashore. Another big lighter came alongside on the • 2nd but refused to take cargo. Why he did so is not known to us. We learn that any amount of lighters was to be had at Moharrek, and we are making investigations to find out whether this is right, and shall let you know in due course. It appears to us that the landing contractor wants to do the whole landing with his own few boats for profits sake. If the landing contractor cannot furnish enough lighters at this time of the year where lighters are ample in Bahrein and the steamers do not bring much cargo, how shall this be in the season when lighters are scarce and cargo plenty? For your guidance we might state that our next steamer has probably about the same amount of cargo, if not more, and we hope that you will be in a position to impress on the Sheikh to furnish enough lighters for the landing of our steamers cargo in the future. We again beg to express our desire to make our own arrangements for landing the cargo from our steamers. Dated Bahrein, the 3rd February 1908.

A V From— Mr. C. Wills, To—Captain F. B. Prideaux, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrein. We have the honour to inclose copies of letters exchanged with Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus and Co., Agents, Hamburg-Amerika Line, relative to the overcarriage of our cargo by the S. S. “ Galicia.” The mere fact of the bulk of our cargo having been overcarried, will be apparent to you that we received differential treatment, and we contend, in consequence, we have a claim on the Hamburg-America Line for loss' of market, etc.The landing contractor, undoubtedly, failed to supply the steamer with sufficient lighters, though there were a large number, both here and at Muharraq lying idle. The question of defective landing arrangements at this port have been frequently brought to your notice by us, as Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and we regret to remark that our protests and complaints have not produced any perceptible improvements, except that the former contractor has been replaced by men who are admittedly worse than their predecessor. We are calling a meeting of the mercantile community of Bahrein to discuss the landing arrangements, with the view of placing it on a more satisfactory basis to obviate recurrent overcarriage of cargo and detention of steamers at this port: if we are successful in holding the meeting we shall advise you particulars. We interviewed the landing contractor, and he has promised to see that there will be no further ground for complaint by giving the work his personal attention, and, relying on his promise, we therefore do not wish to make an official complaint against him. In conclusion, we would add that, for the S. S. “ Goalpara”, lighters were in readiness at the outer anchorage and, in consequence, this steamer received prompt despatch. No. 46, dated Bahrein, the and February 1908. From— Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co., Bahrein, To— Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., Agents, Hamburg-American Line, Bahrein. “ Galicia h . We understand the above steamer has sailed overcarrying the greater portion of our cargo, although the Landing Contractor assured you that he would finish the steamer if she waited another couple of hours. We have observed that all the general cargo, sugar, coffee, etc., in which you, as merchants, are interested in has all been landed, but that only 240 packages our own as under— 214 bags sugar 19 cases matches 7 cases lampware were discharged from the steamer at the last moment. We must strongly protest at the differential treatment that we are receiving at your hands as it appears to us impossible for all our packages to be beneath all the Bahrein cargo, especially as we had 652 packages out of 1,481 packages of the general merchandise to be landed at this port. This is the second occasion our cargo has been overcarried by your steamers recently, and, unless you can give us some guarantee that our goods will be treated in the same way as your own, we shall have to make other arrangements for our shipments from Hamburg. Please let us know when you expect the cargo will be returned. P.S .—We hear that on the first day after taking out all your cargo from No. 4, hatch work was stopped at this hold and that the balance of the cargo there was some of our cargo. Dated Bahrein, the 3rd Febrnary 1908. From— Messrs. Robert Wonckhaus &amp; Co., Agents, Hamburg-American Line, Bahrein, To—M essrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co., Bahrein. In reply to yours of yesterday, we beg to state that 385 bags of sugar and 16 cases of matches of your cargo have been overcarried by S.S. “ Galicia, ” as the landing contractor did not send enough lighters although our steamer was in port for three days.8 These 4oi packages will now be landed in Bushire as per B.L., and we request you to hand us B.L. that we might issue D.L. order on our Bushire Agents, that they deliver the goods to you at Bushire. Of course there can be no talk about a differential treatment of your goods, s~- as the Captain or the Chief Officer of the steamers order which cargo has to be landed first and so on, while we as Agents have nothing to do with it. For your information we might mention that more than half of our kerosene has been over carried as well. We would advise you to put a claim in against the Landing Contractor, as it is only his fault if cargo has been overcarried. We are doing the same regard ing our overcarried cargo. Dated Bahrein, the 3rd February 1908. From — Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co., To—The Landing Contractor, Bahrein. „ ^ , We ^Y 6 been advised by the Agents of the Hamburg.American Line that the Galicia has overcarried-— 385 bags of sugar and 16 cases of matches and that in consequence we have to take delivery of them at Bushire as sufficient lighters were not supplied to that steamer. We are informed by the Agents of the steamer that you are alone to blame for tne overcarriage, and that we must look to you to re-imburse us all expenses incurred toreturn the above packages to Bahrein. We therefore notify you that we claim all expenses, which may be incurred, and also any loss of market. There were any number of empty boats available in the port, which were neither utilized for the mail or the above steamer, so that you can have no excuse tor not supplying this vessel with sufficient lighterage. Dated Bahrein, the 4th February 1908. From— Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co., To Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., Agents, Hamburg-American Line. Bahrein. ’ , We ar f ! n receipt of your letter of 3rd instant, and as suggested have put forward a claim against the Landing Contractor for all extra expenses incurred but at the same time we would inform you this has been done without prejudice toour claim against your Company, as we sti.M contend our cargo has received different treatment to your and others, and still look to you to deliver the cargo to us in Bahrein. It is difficult for us to believe, as we ,stated in our previous letter, that out of 1,460 packages, of which we have nearly half the quantity that our cargo only should be overcarried, and the small quantity landed should * have been the last co be put out by the S.S. “ Galicia.” We know you intended at first to put out 6,000 cases of kerosene oil, but the overcarriage does not much matter to you as you will not require to return it and it seems to us that it was most probable you decided not to land the whole quantity here, as the market price of oil declined on the arrival of your steamer. Dated 3rd February 1908. From— Messrs. Gray Paul Co., Bahrein, To Messrs. R. Wonckhaus Co., Agents, Hamburg-America Line, Bahrein. We sent quit representative to you for delivery orders for our goods, landed ex b.b. ‘ Galicia, and he has now returned saying that you were prepared to issue orders on surrender of Bills of Lading for the goods lying in the Amara, and that delivery orders for the overcarried cargo would be issued on Bushire.We contend that we have a right to our goods at this port, and we must protest against your arbitrary proceeding in advising us to take rest of our cargo in Bushire, shipped for Bahrein. In the meantime, we shall take delivery of the packages which are lying here, and would request you to grant delivery orders for same, and also to acknowledge receipt of Bills of Lading for the remainder 'which you state have not been landed. Dated, Bahrein, the 6th February 1908. From— Messrs. Gray Paul Co., Bahrein, To— Messrs. R. Wonckhaus Co., Agents, Hamburg-American Line, Bahrein. We are in receipt of your favour of 4th instant, and thank you for delivery -orders forwarded therewith. Kindly note that our protest is not in any way prejudiced by the receipt of your delivery order for the overcarried cargo by the S. S. ‘ Galicia. ” No. 66?, dated 25th February 1908. From—The First Assistant Resident (In charge current duties), To—The Political Agent, Bahrein. In reply to your letter No. 88, dated 14th February 1908, I have the honour to inform you that the Resident is on tour, and the questions raised in your letter cannot be dealt with by him at present. To save time, however, I make the following observations in this office as an ad interim reply (1) The German Consul has not made any complaint so far, and perhaps it would be advisable to await his representations before replying seriatim to all the points raised by Mr. Bahnson. Meanwhile, however, you might endeavour informally to have the claim dropped, but if Mr. Bahnson persists it will be necessary to hear the case in the Majlis in the same way as other commercial cases. Mn Bahnson’s claim for preferential treatment does not seem to be sustained by the record of time in harbour and number of packages discharged, from which it would seem that average rate was 90 packages per hour for the “ Galicia ” as against about 50 and 30 for the ‘ Waroonga and Nasen respectively. (2) It would appear that the new landing contractors have hardly been in charge long enough to have been given a fair trial and no doubt on this occasion had a very severe trial, as three steamers were in port at the same time (February ist.) (3) Regarding taking delivery of goods outside of Bahrein it would seem that as the Steamer Company contracts to carry the goods to Bahrein and not to any other port, consignees cannot legally be forced to take delivery else where ; they are not responsible for the failure of the landing contractor to supply boats. It might, however, be a good thing if you were to discuss this matter with the British India Agent at Bahrein, and if the arrangement seems satisfactory you might recommend it to the British India Agent. (4) As to the proposal that the Shipping Agents hire boats, I would suggest that, shipping Agents should report to you if within a reasonable time after the arrival of any steamer sufficient boats have not been sent off. If the facts show that neglect has been shown by the contractors, the Shipping Agents mig t be authorised to hire boats and charge the boat hire to the landing contractor. Your letter and this reply will be put up to the Resident on his return, and any orders or further remarks he may make will be sent to you as soon as possible.10 Letter No 965, dated the 25th March igo8.

Wonckhaus with mv compliments that we are doing our utmost to keep the Sheikh up to his obliga tions in regard to the landing arrangements generally, and that having regard to the special circumstances of this case, and in view of the improvement which has been apparent of late in the working of the existing system I regret that I cannot see my way to support their claim for compensation. No. 272, dated the 8th May 1909. From—The Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to the official correspondence on the subject of Messrs. Wonckhaus’^ claim against the Bahrein landing Department for damages in connection with the work done on the “Galicia,” 1 enclose a copy of mv letter to the firm written as per your instructions with a copy of Messrs. Wonckhaus reply. ’ . .. att ‘ tU( ^ e adopted by Mr. Bahnson is so unreasonable that my first inclination w r as to refuse to send on the letter (which he sent me in duplicate) to you. However on second thoughts I submit it and hope you will tell me what reply to make. He ignores the main reasons for our not harassing the Sheikh and his Contractor, and there was really no reason why he should not have engaged his own boats when he saw the Contractor failing, as Wills had done some months previously in the case of the “Ula ” and Haji Abdun Nabi. I have told him this myself, and all he can say to it is that he had been led by me to believe when the German steamers first began coming here (viz., before the “ Ula’* incident) that the Sheikh would not allow Agents to land their own cargo. In the case of the “Galicia ”, even if Bahnson had promptly informed me of the hitch, I would have advised him tn follow Wills’ example. The letter now written is the more exasperating as there is good reason to believe from Messrs. Gray Paul’s complaints that the German Agents cared nothing whether the oil was landed or not, and if the Captain had only waited another hour or two, the boats, which were actually on their way to his ship, would have been able to take all the cargo.X ia Mr. Bahnson is fighting simply for the principle, as he had openly given out saying that Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co„ are far too weak on such matters. If he succeeded in getting any money out of the Contractor now, I don’t hesitate to say that he would secretly give it back again. No. 23o, dated the l6th April 1O09, From-^-The Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Messrs. R. Wonckhaus &amp; Co, Bahrein. With reference to correspondence ending with your letter of the 7th Feb* ruary 1909 on the subject of the slow discharging of cargo from the S.S. “Galicia’' jn February 1908, l beg to inform you that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has instructed me to reply to you as follows. 2. It does not appear that Messrs. Wonckhaus' contention that they were unfairly treated in favour of the two other steamers is well founded, as the “ Galicia ” discharged on the average 90 packages per hour ^s against the 50 and 30 respectively put out by the “ Waroonga ” and “ NasseriThe con tractors, moreover, having only just come into office and being still deficient of some of the boats which they engaged themselves to acquire in the course of some months, were put to a very severe test on this occasion with three steamers in the port. 3. In these special circumstances Major Cox desires me to inform vou, with his compliments, that as we are doing our utmost to keep the Sheikh of Bahrein up to his obligations in regard to the landing arrangements generally, and in view of the improvement which has been apparent of late in the working of the existing system &gt; he regrets that he cannot see his way to supporting your claim fur compensation. Dated Bahrein, the 30th April 1909. From—R obert Wonckhaus &amp; Co., Bahrein, To—His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrein. We beg to acknowledge receipt of your favour dated t6th April, No. 220, from which we are sorry to see, that Major Cox cannot support our claim for compensation for not landing of our cargo ex S. S. “ Galicia. ” We should be very much pleased if Major Cox would reconsider our clain&gt; and we therefore draw the attention to the following points in our claim. If the “ Galicia ” discharged 90 packages per hour against 50 and 30 of the other two steamers it has to be considered that our cargo was chiefly kerosene oil which counts 3-4 cases to an average package of cargo in the space of the lighters. The “ Galicia' was the first steamer to arrive and came before the mail steamer and the Bombay Persian steamer. We are of course aware that the mail steamer had the preference for discharging, but what reason is there to give preference to the S.S. “ Nasseri who came a day or two later ? As we pointed out in our letter of 3rd ^ February 1908, the landing contractor sent the third day which our steamer was in harbour practically all the lighters to the “ Nasseri,” ignoring our steamer at all. If we were at liberty to make our own landing arrangements neither would ' the “ Galicia ' have been detained in harbour for three days nor would she have overcarried any of her cargo, and if the Sheikh claims the sole right of landing for the landing contractors, they surely ought to pay for loss-s incurred by their I arbitrary treatment of our steamers as occurred at the time the “ Galicia was in harbour.We might mention that our account with the purchaser of our kerosene is still pending, as this man wants an allowance for those kerosene cases which have not been landed. Awaiting your further news. Dated the 29th May 1909. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Herr W. Wassmuss, Imperial German Consul, Bushire. With reference to Messrs. Wonckhaus’ claim in connection with a visit of S. S. “ Galicia ” to Bahrein, about which you spoke to me, I enclose a copy of a letter which 1 have addressed to our Political Agent at Bahrein to-day which will show you how the matter stands, Dated the 29th May 1909. From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Captain C. F. Mackenzie, LA., Political Agent, Bahrein. Please see Mr. Bahnson’s letter of April 30th regarding his “ Galicia ” claim, of which a copy was forwarded to me with Major Prideaux’s letter of 8th May. But for your unfortunate outbreak of plague, which would mean my going into lengthy quarantine on my return, 1 had intended to pay Bahrein a visit recently and might then have dealt with this matter personally. That course however is now impracticable. Please therefore inform Mr. Bahnson with my compliments that I have been carefully through the papers again but find difficulty in arriving at any other view than that already explained to him, which has been applied equally in the case of a British claim of a parallel nature. Nevertheless, I have no wish to seem unreasonable or uncompromising and before sending any official reply to his letter of 30th April have preferred to refer the papers for the opinion of higher authority. I will communicate again on receiving their views. G. C. B. P., Simla.—No. C 52 F. D.— 28 -&lt;M&gt; 9 «— 44 —G.E.D.Secret, No. 11. India Office, London, 21st May 1909. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. My hoftD, The proposals made in Your Excellency’s Secret letter No. 1S8, Proposed Order in Council con- d a ted the 14th November 1907, for /erring on the Political Agent at regularising the judicial powers Bahrein jurisdiction over British pvp r oi-o Pf i i A . , subjects and foreigners in Bahrein. 7 n • 1 Agent at nahrein, by the issue of an Order m Council placing both British subjects and foreigners under his jurisdiction, have been considered by His Majesty’s Government, in connection with the general question of the policy, political and com- mercial, to be followed in the Persian Gulf in order to meet the change m the situation consequent upon the development of the Bagdad Railway scheme. 2. The general conclusion at which His Majesty’s Government have arrived is that the competition to which British trade in the Persian ^ Gulf is exposed is not merely commercial, but has a distinctly political object. British claims to political predominance in the Gulf are based mainly upon the fact of our commercial interests having hitherto “ been predominant, and should our trade, as a result of a German “ forward commercial policy, be impaired, our political influence would proportionately diminish. It follows that purely political action on ‘‘ our part, not having as its objective the development of material “ British interests, might have a prejudicial effect, both politically and commercially, by reason of the suspicions it would be likely to rouse.” 3. Ihe pioposals which you have made for the extension of the juiisdiction of the Political Agent at Bahrein fall within the lines of policy appioved by llis Majesty s Government. Their adoption would mark anothei stage in the development of the virtual protectorate which we exercise over Bahrein, to which the growing importance of the island as a centre of trade may be attributed. 4. It will tend to strengthen our position in Bahrein, and to remove risks of interference by other Powers, if jurisdiction over foreigners is placed in our hands. But our protectorate has never been formally notified, except to Turkey and Persia, and in the event of controversy arising with other Powers as to the assumption of jurisdiction overtheir subjects by the Political Agent, it will be preferable that our action should be based on a request from the Sheikh to be relieved of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners. When this has been arranged, an Order in Council can be issued. It does not seem expedient to make the Order in Council the medium of formally declaring a protectorate over Bahrein. Persian and Turkish claims to the sovereignty of the island have been repudiated by us m a form to. preclude the necessity of any further discussion of the question with them. But neither Turkey nor Persia has formally abandoned its claims, and the Persian Government have not recognised, though we have consistently asserted, our right to protect Bahreinis in Persian territory. In the present political conditions of Turkey and Persia it is clear that we should scrupulously avoid any action that could be represented as an attempt to utilise their difficulties for selfish purposes. There is also the risk that the formal declaration of a protectorate might be regarded as a challenge by other Powers than Persia and Turkey, who might raise the question of our rights in a provocative form. 5. I request that the Political Agent at Bahrein may be instructed to approach the Sheikh, with the object of obtaining from him, as a necessary preliminary to the issue of the Order in Council, a request that the British Government will relieve him of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in the island. 6. As regards British subjects, no difficulty arises in respect of the proposed Order in Council in view of the terms of Article 4 of the Treaty of 1861, and of the usage that has been established. 7. It will be convenient that the first draft of the Order in Council should be prepared by Your Excellency’s Government, with a view to Providing ioi any local peculiarities that may require consideration. I have the honour to be, My Lord, ^ oui Loidship s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn.1907. SIMLA. FOREIG-N EEPA-RTMEHSTT SECRET. External.

With a view to define and regularise the powers exercised over British * Tirfe paragraph 6 of enclosure No. 5. sheets by the Agent, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* has put forward the suggestion that he should be appointed to he a Justice of the Peace and endowed with the powers of a District Judge in direct subordination to the High Court of Bombay. We concur in this recommendation, hut with reference to clause 2 of the Indian Foreign Jurisdiction Order in Council, 1902, we under stand that it would first be necessary for Bahrein to be declared by His Majesty in Council to be a territory in which jurisdiction is exercised by, or on behalf of His Majesty through the Governor-General in Council. We would accordin^lv request that, if His Majesty’s Government see no objection, the necessary Order in Council may be passed providing for the exercise of jurisdiction in Bahrein. 4. But, further, in view of the increase of foreign shipping and foreign interest generally in the Gulf, and of the establishment of foreign firms and missions in Bahrein, which has already caused practical difficulties it seems desirable that, if possible, in maintenance of the status quo in the Gulf provision should be made in the Order in Council for the exercise by the Political Agent of jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrein, before foreign interests have so largely developed as to render the assumption of the le °al duties of a protecting power a matter of greater intricacy and difficulty involving perhaps, as in the case of Zanzibar, diplomatic representations to foreign powers.

In December 1893 Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that the Chief of Bahrein was under British protection, which would also be extended to his subjects whenever there may be occasion for it.

Barnes, Esq., C.S.I., I.C.S., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. The Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein reports that during the year 1901 he has been requested by masters of merchant vessels to issue bills of health on four occasions and also to note five Marine protests : he has also been applied to for one passport and also to legalize nineteen signatures on behalf of British Indian subjects. He reports that the fees leviable for the ser« vices thus rendered would have amounted to £8-17-6 according to the scale of Consular fees, had he possessed authority to levy such fees. 2. So far as the issue of bills of health, noting of Marine protests, etc , are concerned, such acts can only be performed by officers possessing Consular ra®k, which the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, does not possess, and with which, in view of the political status of Bahrein, it will probably be incon venient to invest him. I do not, however, anticipate that much inconvenience will be experienced on this account, as the number of direct merchant vessels calling at Bahrein is not large. The mail steamers and most of the other mer chant vessels which call at Bahrein also visit Bushire, where application can be made for the performance of duties required under the Merchant Shipping Act. It will be better therefore, I think, that the Assistant Political Agent should in future inform masters of merchant vessels, who make applications to him, that he has no authority to perform duties of a Consular nature. 3. With regard to duties of a notarial nature such as the legalization of signatures, execution of powers-of-attorney, and other acts which might be required of a Notary Public, I think that it may be advisable that the Assistant Political Agent should be appointed by notification in the Gazette of India under the Negotiable Instruments Act, XXVI of 1881, to be a Notary Public for the islands of Bahrein, and authorized at the same time to levy fees to be credited to the Government of India, in accordance with the scale of fees levied under the provisions of the Persian Coasts and Islands Order in Council. 4. With regard to the issue of passports, I propose to instruct the Assistant Political Agent to forward any applications which he may receive to me for disposal. No. 914 -E.A., dated Simla, the 6th May 1902 . From—J. B. Wood, Esq., I.C.S., Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 7, dated the 16th January 1902, requesting that the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein may be appointed to be a Notary Public for the islands of Bahrein. 2. I am to point out that the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (XXVI of 1881), under which you propose to appoint Mr. Gaskin to be a Notary Public, has not been applied to Bahrein, and that there is not at present any authorised procedure by which it can be brought into general operation there. Moreover, the appointment of Mr. Gaskin to be a Notary Public under the Act would only constitute him a Notary Public for the purposes of that specific enactment, and would not authorise him, as you apparently suppose, to do such other acts as might be required of a Notary Public. Special provision has been made by the Commissioners for Oaths Act, 1889 (52 Viet., c. 10), section 6, for the perform ance of Notarial acts in foreign countries by diplomatic and Consular officers of His Majesty, and, though the law both in England and in India recognises certain acts of Public Notaries appointed by foreign authority, it is inexpedient to rely upon such authority for the appointment of a diplomatic officer of a class not specified in the statute. 3. In the circumstances above explained, it is a matter for consideration whether the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein should not be invested withj r Consular powers which would enable him to perform the functions of a Notary Public by virtue of his office and, if you think that there is sufficient justifica tion for the grant of such powers, the Government of India will be prepared to consider any proposal which you may make to this effect. 4. The Government of India are aware that the peculiar status of Bahrein may possibly render the investment of Mr. Gaskin with Consular powers a somewhat anomalous proceeding, but they are disposed to think that no practical difficulty need be apprehended from the step, and that there may be advantages m providing for the exercise of power and jurisdiction over His Majesty’s European subjects and others in Bahrein and on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf by an Order in Council similar to that which has been framed for Maskat and for the Persian Coasts and Islands. The Governor-General in Council will, therefore, be glad to be furnished with your opinion on this proposal, together with any alternative suggestions which you may have to offer. J No. 10 -S.A.., dated Shiraz, the 2 nd July 1902 . From L ibutenant-Colonbl C. A. Kbmball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, T°*~The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 914-E.A., dated 6th May, in which, after pointing out the impracticability of the proposal submitted by me for the investment of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein with certain notarial powers, you say thut it is a matter for consider ation whether the Assistant Political Agent should not be invested with Con sular powers which would enable him to perform the functions of a Notary Public by virtue of bis office. J 2. In my opinion, considering the requirements of Bahrein and the nature of our representation there, it is not necessary nor advisable that the Assistant Political Agent should have more than Vice-Consular rank, which could, as in the case of the Vice-Consul at Bushire, he conferred on him by warrant of the Consul-General at Bushire. At present, however, the Consular jurisdiction of the Resident at Bushire does not extend beyond the Persian side of the Gulf and the islands appertaining thereto, and although the question of Consular jurisdiction for Bahrein and the Arabian Coast of the Gulf was considered at the time when the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council was drafted vide paragraph 5 of the Despatch No. 110-External, dated 22nd July 1887, from the Government of India, to the Secretary of State for India—it is not clear to me whether at that time the issue of a separate Order in Council for that side of the Gulf was contemplated. The simplest solution of the question would be to extend the Resident’s Consular jurisdiction in the required direc tion without the issue of a separate Order in Council. He could then issue a warrant appointing Mr. Gaskin to he Vice-Consul at Bahrein. Mr. Gaskin would thus be enabled by virtue of his office to perform the functions of a Notary Public, and the powers conferred upon him would, for all the present practical requirements of Bahrein, be ample. If, however, a separate Order in Council is required, it should, I think, be framed with a view to extend the Resident’s Consular jurisdiction and not to create a separate and independent Consular appointment as at Maskat. same time, I am inclined to doubt whether the requirements of the case justify the issue of a separate Order in Council to provide for Consular jurisdiction at Bahrein and the other places in the Gulf not already provided for by Orders in Council. The Assistant Political Agent is already invested with magisterial powers in criminal cases over British Indian subjects, and there are at present no European British subjects at Bahrein. Thewant, therefore, of Consular jurisdiction has not hitherto been felt to any appreciable extent, and the object of my letter No. 7, dated 16th January, was merely to suggest that notarial powers should be conferred upon the Assistant Political Agent so as to enable him to perform certain notarial functions and levy fees for so doing. As a matter of fact, Courts in India are not, I think, likely to dispute the validity of the Assistant Political Agent’s attestation of 2 o v y i i /documents and the question of the levy of fees is not of much importance. If, therefore, a separate Order in Council is required to invest the Assistant Politi cal Agent with Consular rank, I am disposed to think that there is at present no sufficient justification for the measure. 4. In connection with the extension of Consular jurisdiction to Bahrein, it is, I think, necessary to bear in mind that although we have an agreem ent with the Chief of Bahrein whereby Foreign Consular Agencies cannot he es tablished in Bahrein without the consent of the British Government, it may perhaps be inconvenient to maintain this position in the event of British Con sular jurisdiction being extended to Bahrein. The German Consul at Bushire informed me once in course of conversation that he considered his jurisdiction in the Gulf to extend wherever mine did, and I think he said that his instruc tions from his Government were to this effect. This point has not of course escaped the notice of the Government of India, but I mention it so as to make my present report as complete as possible.No. 76, dated Bushire, the 25th February (received 13th March) 1906. From Major P. Z. Cox, C.I,E , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, T 0 The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to Foreign Department letter No. 708-E.A., dated the 4th May 1901, to the address of my predecessor, on the subject of the administration of justice in Bahrein in cases in which European foreigners are concerned. The instructions conveyed in the second paragraph of the letter were duly conveyed to the Assistant Political Agent, Mr. Gaskin, for guidance, but I am not sure whether, when the question was considered on that occasion, the time-honoured arrangement under which commercial justice has hitherto been administered in Bahrein, by a permanent native majlis, was familar to the Government of India ; and in any case the existing position at Manama makes me think it advisable to make another reference on the subject. 2. In the first place, I may mention that at the end of October last, Dr. Listemann who had then recently taken over the duties of German Consul at Bushire, spoke to me informally on the subject of the position of German subjects in Bahrein. He began by saying that he understood from the corres pondence on his records that the Residency would take exception to his addressing Sheikh Esa direct on behalf of a German subject in Bahrein. I replied in the affirmative, on tlie grounds that the foreign relations of the Chief were in our hands. He then went on to enquire what amount of pro tection we should consider it possible to afford to German subjects trading in Bahrein. I rejoined that my instructions were that we should always give European foreigners our good offices as a matter of courtesy, and that, if necessary, they should receive the same amount of protection 'as if they were British subjects, as had Mr. Bahnson at the time of the attack on him. As regards the commercial claims of European foreigners, I expressed the opinion that in ordinary cases it would be in their interests to endeavour to get justice from the Sheikh direct in the first instance, and that if this course failed they could then ask the good offices of our Agent. Reference was then made to the majlis or permanent committee of respect able native merchants appointed for the settlement of commercial disputes, which is a feature of the administration of justice in Bahrein. Dr, Listemann’s idea seemed to be that the interests of European merchants might be prejudiced by being submitted to the arbitration of a purely native tribunal, I informed him that speaking from memory I believed that the majlis in such cases usually sat at the Agency, under the supervision of the Political Agent, and that ordinarily I thought that the finding of the majlis would be subject to his concurrence. On conclusion of the conversation, my colleague said that he had been asking for personal enlightenment as a new comer, and since then I have heard no more from him on the subject in question. 3. The question of the formation and status of this majlis has recently been brought into some prominence in connection with the case of claims against the estate of one Seyyid Khalaf, deceased, with regard to which I have addressed the Government of India in my letter No. 75 of to-day’s date. Search has been made in the Bushire records for any correspondence throwing light on the origin of this tribunal, but nothing has up to the present been found, nor does it appear that it was an arrangement introduced specially at the instance of the Residency, nor that the Resident has hitherto exercised any revisionary powers over it. The institution seems to have been developed automatically in the days of our Native Agents and to have, up till recently, fulfilled its purpose quietly and adequately. I attach a memorandum on the subject compiled from some incidental references to the subject in communi cations received from our present Political Agent. 14. With reference to the position of Foreign European merchants in Bahrein, I learn from Captain Prideaux that the four representatives of the German firm, of which Herr Wonckhaus is the principal, are still in the habit, when in conversation with him, of harping upon their claim to extra territorial lity in Bahrein both in regard to criminal and commercial matters. Captain Prideaux considers in fact that they would definitely refuse to &lt;*o before the Sheikh’s tribunals, and that if we were to say that this majlis with local merchants sitting on it, and the British representative supervising the finding, is a Territorial Court, they would perhaps object even to that. If, on the other hand, we say that the majlis is a Court which the Protecting Power in consultation with the Chief has evolved for the settlement of dis putes in which British subjects or Europeans claiming our good offices are concerned, it would seem to afford them an opening for asking us to define our position more precisely. For present purposes I asked the Chief informally at my interview on the 14th insiant to agree to that pending any further communication between us on the subject, findings come to by the majlis sitting at the Agency should be considered as subject to modification by the Political Agent' 5 in consulta tion with himself, Sheikh Esa, in the event of the European foreigner concern ed not being satisfied with the settlement made by the majlis. I trust that pending full consideration of the subject, the Government of India will approve of this arrangement. 11 5. Ihe present position being as described in the foregoing paragraphs, the Government of India will perhaps concur with me in thinking that the question of the administration of justice in Bahrein at the present time requires to be placed on a more precise footing, both in view of the gradual influx of Europeans into the island, and of the modified situation brought about by the appointment of a fully qualified gazetted officer of the superior status to represent our interests. r 6. In connection with the question of the judicial position of the latter, I heg to refer to the correspondence ending with Colonel KembalTs letter No. 10-S.A., addressed to the Foreign Department on 2nd July 1902, on the subject of the appointment of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein to be a Notary Public, and would ask that the question of the issue of an Order m Council for Bahrein may again be taken into consideration. If it is thought necessary to give our representative Consular status for duties in connection with merchant shipping, then perhaps the terms of his appointment in that capacity might nominally refer only to Katr and Katif and not to Bahrein. * As regards Bahrein, it would seem most convenient that he should be appointed a Justice of Peace and endowed with the powers of a Subordinate Judge with appeal to the Besident in the Persian Gulf, or with those of a District Judge in direct subordination to the High Court of Bombay. As, however, tbe precise nature of the powers which it is necessary to give him and the manner in which it should be done, is inseparable from tbe larger question of our own relations in regard to Bahrein, it seems advisable for me at this stage merely to commend the subject to the wise consideration of the Government of India in conjunction with the other questions affecting Bahrein which I am now reporting upon. Memorandum regarding the Bahrein majlis or permanent Native Court of Arbitration dated 26 th February 1906 . For the last 49 years or more it has been customarv here, when commer cial disputes have arisen between British subjects or prot'egbs on the one hand and Bahrein subjects or persons of any other nationality on the other, for tbe British Agent, first Native and subsequently English—to assemble a Court of Arbitration, locally called a mail is formed from a body of respectable persons 23 whose names are borne on a permanent list for the hearing and adjudication ox Duo case. . . P rac tice at its origin received the assent of the Chief and the list includes a number of the most influential Sunni, Shiah, and Hindu Indian merchants of Bahrein. The Court has always had six permanent members and a few waiting members called m occasionally when any of the permanent members are sick or away from Bahrein. The six permanent members at present are 2 Bahrein subjects (one Sunni and one Shiah). 2 Arabs of Nejd. 2 British Indian Hindus. When the services of the majlig are required it has not been the invariable custom to refer each time to the local authorities, as no person sits in the Court m a particular case whose presence is objected to by either party, and although a munshi of the Chief s does sometimes attend at the request of one party or the other for the purpose of watching the proceedings, such is not always or necessarily the case. No doubt, however, if a witness refused to attend it would be necessary to invoke the Sheikh’s assistance, but in practice this difficulty has never occurred. The services of this mojlig are frequently invoked for the settlement of disputes between British subjects and between parties of different nation alities, and then it assembles at the Agency unless given special permission for purposes of convenience to assemble elsewhere. The Sheikh also refers to it occasionally cases between Bahrein subiects which he finds it inconvenient or difficult to settle off-hand himself. The reputation of the majlis locally is exceedingly high, and it does not appear that the Residency has ever interfered with or quashed its decisions which are usually in the nature of a compromise. During the last year only one case has come under the Political Agent’s notice in which the settlement ot the mcijlis was not accepted without demur. In that instance the Political Agent re-assembled the Court, as the objector alleged that the whole of his evidence had not been examined, and finding the objection frivolous confirmed the Court’s decision. ° The position of the Political Agent towards the Court hitnerto seems to be more analogous to that of a Judge Advocate than a Court of Appeal. Where none of the litigants were British subjects or entitled to British protection he has really no locus standi^ but yet under the peculiar circumstances of the case, principles may often be involved which affect the interests of the whole community. The litigants themselves have no right to nominate the members of the Court in their particular suit, but the interests of both parties are carefully considered in this regard, and the members selected either by the Chief or the Political Agent or by both in consultation according to the varying circum stances of the case. No. 516 (Confidential), dated Bushire,the 4th (received 13 th) March 1906 . From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to submit the report called for in Poreign Department telegram No. 972-E.B., dated 1st March, together with an expression of my views as to the most convenient method of dealing with a member of the Persian community in Bahrein who has committed an offence on board a British ship in Bahrein harbour.2. A copy of the Political Agent’s original report is enclosed. It treats Bahrein, No. 46, dated 26 th January 1906. of two distinct Cases, with regard tothe , °f which a separate reference was made to the Government of India by telegraph on 19ih February. At the time I received Captain Prideaux’s communication I was expecting to visit Bahrein a few days later and preferred to discuss the cases further with him before taking specific action on his report. 3. Under the older order of things the disposal of neither case would have presented much practical difficulty, but the critical vigilance of foreigners and agents of foreign representatives at the present time makes it advisable tor us to shape our procedure as far as possible on lines which will pass hostile criticism should any be offered, and I therefore treated the present cases with some caution. 1 Several possible solutions were discussed between the Political Agent and myself, but everyone carried with it some objection either local or le-al and 1 came to the conclusion that it would be best to refer both eases to higher authority on the broader issues involved and on receipt of instructions to carry them out as far as the local conditions admitted. J lam now desired to submit a fuller report with my own views in respect of the case m which a Persian subject is concerned. 4. Primarily three alternative courses seem to admit of consideration (?) That the Tolthcal Agent should place the results of his preliminary enquiry before Sheikh Esa and let him punish the man. From the correspondence leading up to the Ultimatum which was piesented to Shdkh Esa last year in connection with the attack on Mr. Bah ns on and on the Persian community, respectively, I gather that we have not definitely withdrawn the Persians in Bahiem from the Sheikh’s jurisdiction in ordinary matters, but have contented ourselves with asserting our right to interfere when necessary to save them or any other persons not subjects of the Sheikh from oppression. If this be the correct view, there would be no primary objection to course (1). On the other hand, . ere aie a e Ddant difficulties which Captain Prideaux mentions in para 0 rap i of his letter, and it is, moreover, probable that if the Persian were handed over to Sheikh Esa without any definite pronouncement of our decision in regard to the exercise of jurisdiction over Persians generally, the remainder of the Persian community would take alarm at this course and report the matter (ii) The Persian might be forwarded to the Bushire Besidency with a statement of the ease and might be handed over to the local Persian authorities at Bushire for disposal. Ihe Political Agent is averse to this course if it can be avoided for the reasons stated by him. ^ Apart from the latter the procedure has o be considered in its bearing upon the discussion which is now progressing between the representatives of the British and Persian Governments in Tehran or London, and it seems chiefly a question for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government as to whether this course would inconvenience them in anyway. It would m any case be an indirect pronouncement to the effect that Persians were withwrawn altogether from the jurisdiction of the heik i of Bahrein, and also were not justiceable in criminal matters by the British representative; and such a ruling would embrace the case of all foreigners in Bahrein. 4/&gt; © mmmm 1 &gt; k (m) The Political Agent might ask the prisoner if Jie consents to submit to his jurisdiction, and if he does he might be forthmth sentenced and punished under the Political AgenVs supervision. The objection to this is that the mere asking of the question would put the idea into the man’s head that there was some doubt as to our rig it to deal with him, and if he were subsequently aggrieved by the sentence inflicted on him, it would probably occur to him or some of his relations to complain to Bushire. Moreover, the local authorities here have agents in Bahrein who report everything to them which passes. There are hardly sufficient grounds for treating him as a British employe. 5 Of the three courses above suggested the last commends itself to me most, but on the whole I am inclined to advise that the man be detained by the Political Agent for some little time longer uuder present conditions, and be m e( * ^ r °i^ n if a ^ LI,ei J 2i. t er ritory conjointly by the Political Agent and the Sheikh in consultation. ^ His previous history would certainly deter him from drawing attention to himself in Persia. I admit that this would not be an entirely satisfactory solution from a Bahrein point of view as the man mi^ht be considered to have got off too easily, but the adoption of this alternative possesses none of the potential disadvantages attaching to the previous ones, and before another similar case were likely to arise Government would have time to give deliberate consideration to the question of the future treatment of Persians and loieigneis in Bahrein and the judicial powers with which it is advisable to equip our Agent. 6 In considering the cases under report I have studied Hall’s Foreign Jurisdiction of the British Crown, to wTiich I would invite reference, but have not found in it anything very helpful to a decision in regard to the present cases except in a negative way. It is clear, however, that the powers of our Political Agent need putting on a more satisfactory basis than they are at present, and I have addressed the Government of India on this subiect in a recent communication, 2\o. 76 of 25th February 1906. No. 40, dated Bahrein, the 2Gth January 1906. From— Captain F. B. Pridbaux, Political Agent, Bahrein, To—I he Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, I have the honour to inform you that there are now under detention in this Agency twelve persons who have been charged with criminal offences— eleven with having dishonestly sold a portion of the property under their custody, to wit the cargo of an Indian sailing boat at an intermediate port instead of delivering it to the rightful consignee at Bahrein, and one with having committed a serious theft on board a British mail-steamer in the full view of some six or seven coolies and in the belief that his position of authority over them would preserve him from all unpleasant consequences. 2. All these prisoners, after hearing the evidence of the prosecution in their respective cases have voluntarily confessed their guilt. It only remains, therefore, if Government concur in the recommendations contained in this letter for me to issue the judgments and sentences. 3. Before doing this, however, I think that it is necessary for me to sub mit the following observations on the general position in such criminal cases within my Political jurisdiction, and also briefly to invite attention to the points in which the two cases that have arisen differ from each other. 4. In the sailing-boat case, though the vessel is registered in India and the owner is a British subject, the crew are all inhabitants of Gwadar, and presumably therefore subjects of Maskat : they are Baluchis in nationality. The consignee is a Bahrein subject, and the offence was first brought to my cognizance by the Chief of Bahrein, who formally requested me to deal with it. I do not propose to sentence the accused to a term of more than six months’ imprisonment, and as arrangements can be easily made for the enforce ment of this punishment with hard but useful and productive labour in Bahrein, I venture to express the opinion that no considerations of any special intricacy affect this case. 55. In the other case the circumstances are more serious. The offender is a Persian, who is proved to possess a very bad character, but who has apparently been allowed employment on board the British Indian Steam Navigation Company s steamers on account of his influence over the class from which the coolies are drawn, this influence being due to his reputation for cruelty and general wickedness during a period of service as Ferrash-bashi and executioner under the Deputy Governor of Lingah. In an endeavour to involve in his own misfortune the permanent servant of the Steamer Company, whose office was immediately to supervise him this individual has confessed to having committed not onlv the offence of which he is accused, but also of having habitually pilfered cargo. At the same time he has most successfully concealed the Its. 300 now stolen. I am of opinion that this man s punishment cannot be adequately fixed at less than two years’ rigo rous imprisonment. He is said to be practically impervious to the effect &amp; of floggings and hot-iron firings which punishments he was made acquainted with in Ins own person before he fled from Persia, so that if his present offence had been committed mthat country, there is not much doubt that he would now be condemned, by any but a friendly judge, to suffer the loss of his right hand. . The Government of Bahrein have no arrangements for keeping convicts iuf 11106 ! i f °| r . tb ! s . 1 ] ortest periods. In this particular case, too, the Sheikh would doubtless object, if he were asked to feed aud imprison a foreigner wio had committed a crime ou board a vessel in his waters certainly ° but claiming extra-territoriality against him. Were the offence sufficiently unimportant as to merit only a few months* —ament, the difficulty could perhaps be evaded by thLon^tutTon of a Court, composed of myself and a representative of the Chief, as is customarily done v.hen an accused is a Bahrein subject or a foreigner who prefers not to - o to e f tlSh S ° 0d ° ffiCeS ’ aD&lt;1 the 0tller party is a or foreign subject . , 7 - If 01 does \\ s f e ™ desirable that the trial of the accused should be informally completed by me and that he should then be made over to the Persian authorities to undergo such sentence as they may be capriciously pleased to enforce upon him. It is possible that in such circumstances he might suffer a no more worse punishment than imprisonment until the Maho- medan Bew Year s day, but, on the other hand, as a refugee from Persia, and more particularly if he is a fugitive from the jurisdiction of the present Governor of the Gulf Ports, Ins treatment might be worse than the Government of India would care to contemplate. 8. It seems to me that such a case as this may occur again. Moreover there are a number of foreigners, such as Native Christians, in the islands in regard to whom a sentence of a long term of imprisonment here or even the trial or a capital charge would be impossible. 9 - :Forei g n Department Notiflcation No. 468-E.A.. dated the 22nd r q&gt; 7 o 19 ?V j°!? m oAlu ate . d ^ predecessor under your office endorsement No. 379, dated the 20th April 1901, the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein was granted the powers of a Magistrate of the 1st Class in respect of offences committed by Native Indian subjects of His Majesty.
