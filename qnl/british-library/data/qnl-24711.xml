With reference to your letter of the 22na. inetent respecting the travelling expenses of His Majesty's Vice Consul at Hodeida, I am directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to point out for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, that the Consular Office at Hodeidah is not on the sane footing as the Consulates in Persia, and that the liability of the Imperial Government is limited to the payment of a fixed contribution of Three hundred and fifty pounds a year towards the total expenses of the Post. As regards the practice of this Department m such cases, I am to state that, after five years residence at his post, a Consular Officer is entitled to one half of his own travelling expenses, and one third of those of his family when proceeding on leave of absence.

It is contrary to the general practice of the Government of India to give passage or grant a passage allowance to an officer of the Indian services proceeding on leave, hut an exception is made in the case of junior Army and Marine officers when invalided, who are given passage one way, and 11 not-entitled” passages are also occasionally granted to officers, whether military or civil, on leave on private affairs, if there is room in the military transports. Assistant Surgeon Richardson is drawing small pay in comparison with other consular officers in the service of the Government of India, and if the Foreign Office are willing to make a contribution towards his travelling expenses I think we might, as a special case, do the same. I would suggest that a letter he sent to the Foreign Office (1) stating that under Indian rules Assistant Surgeon Richardson is not entitled to travelling expenses when' I S. 11 % 8 when proceeding on or returning from leave; (2) inquiring what alloioance would he made hy the Foreign Office to one of their officers in similar circumstances, and (3) saying that if they would he willing to contribute half the amount in question towards Assistant Surgeon Richardson f s expenses ice would he willing to contribute the other half. //S-. l 1 1 (1 /a fleJ-. £0w Departments are requested, if they suspect that there is any mistake in this tilegram, to communicate immediately with the Private Secretary to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.

'908 No. 334 of 1908. GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FINANCE DEPARTMENT. ACCOUNTS AND FIN ANCE. Rates of Exchange. To The Right Honourable VISCOUNT MORLEY of BLACKBURN, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 5th November 1908. My Lord, We have the honour to forward, for Your Lordship’s consideration, a copy of correspondence with His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Jeddah, relating to a representation made by Dr. G. A. Richardson, I.S.M.D., His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Hodeida, in respect to the loss to which he is subjected by fluctuations in the rate of exchange between Indian currency and that ordinarily used in Yemen. 2. Dr. Richardson urges that, owing to the continuous appreciation of the Maria Theresa dollar, which is said to be the current coin of the province, and a concurrent rise in the cost of living, he is placed in a peculiarly dis advantageous position at Hodeida; and, as a solution of the difficulties in which he is placed, he suggests the adoption of one of the following courses :— (j) the grant to him of an exchange compensation or a local allowance; (it) the payment of his salary in dollars, rupees being converted into dollars at a fixed rate of Rs. 143f per 100 dollars, or (Hi) the payment to him as compensation of the difference between the intrinsic value and the fictitious value of the rupee converted into dollars as represented by the rate of exchange on the first day of each month. 3. Dr. Richardson draws his pay in rupees, the greater number of which he must, for domestic purposes, convert into dollars. The continuous deprecia tion of the value of the rupee is, therefore, a serious consideration for an officer in his position, and entitles him to some relief. After fully considering his representation, we are of opinion that it will sufficiently meet his claim if we allow him, at his option, to receive his salary in dollars at the rate of Rs. 150= 100 dollars, which is approximately the average rate of exchange betwee.1 k l *——11—&gt;1 . mun .' '• rupee and the Maria Theresa dollar for the past five years, and we solicit Your Lordship’s sanction to this proposal. In * Vide Your Lordship’s Political despatch No. 48, 1 dated the 1 st May, 1908 . view of the recent addition which has been made to Dr. Richardson’s salary, we see no adequate reason for giving this further concession with retrospective effect. We have the honour to be, My Lord, Tour Lordship’s most obedient, humble Servants, (Signed) 99 C. H. SCOTT. H. ADAMSON. J. S. MESTON.—li —&lt;1 t E^cld. No. 1. No. 45, dated the 17th October 1907. From—J. H. Monahan, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Jeddah, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from Dr. Eichardson, British Vice-Consul at Hodeida, applying for an exchange compensation allowance, and I would respectfully recommend his application to your favourable consideration. A permanent exchange compensation or local allowance of Es. 50 (fifty rupees) which is his first proposal seems, I would submit, the easiest and simplest mode of relief and in every way reasonable. SUB-ENCLO. ENCLO. No. 1. No. 78, dated Hodeida, the 2nd October 1907. From—G. A. Richardson, Esq., His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Hodeida, To—J. H. Monahan, Esq., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Jeddah. I have the honour to represent for your consideration and for favour of your kind recommendation on the subject to the Government of India, the disad vantageous conditions under which I serve at Hodeida, and more especially due to loss in salary accruing from a serious fluctuation in the rate of exchange of the Maria Theresa dollar, which might be described as the current coin of this province. 2. My salary is paid to me here in dollars, as rupees, besides not being obtainable, would be of no use. If paid in gold, British or foreign, the calculations are based on the existing rate of exchange of the dollar at Hodeida, and by no means depend on that of the gold coin itself in the monetary markets of the world. 3. The rate of exchange of the Maria Theresa dollar, whose intrinsic value is roughly estimated at Is. lid. (or 100 dollars being equivalent to Es. 143|), has steadily risen during the past five years. The average rate of exchange in 1901 (the year of my appointment to Hodeida) was Es. 142 for 100 dollars, and since has varied between 135 and 145 till during the past two years, when it has never been below 165 or 175 G.-, for 100 dollars). 4, The above represents a loss to me in salary of nearly 20 per cent, during 1906 and 1907 owing to a depreciation of the Indian rupee. 5. To quote an instance in support of the obove statement, I might point out that on first appointment on a salary of Es. 3001 used to receive 211 dollars rough ly, whereas during the past two years on a salary of Es. 400 a month and the rate of exchange fluctuating between 165 and 175, this has only amounted to between 228 and 242 dollars. 6. The value or purchasing power of the dollar locally, while it stood at this inequitable rate, has nevertheless remained the same. 7. Wages to servants, the cost of labour and the necessaries of life are paid in dollars here and at the same rate throughout the year, irrespective of the rise in exchange, which entails a serious pecuniary loss. Added to this circumstance, I might state that the cost of living at Hodeida has steadily advanced 50 per cent, in excess of what it was six or seven years ago. 8. In short, I beg to represent that I am placed in a peculiarly disadvanta geous position here owing principally to the daily fluctuations in the rate of ex change, and which has not to be contended with, or not to the same extent, by an officer of the Crown, serving in any other part of the world. This also, in spite of the fact that no remedy Could be found if I were paid m rupees, or even in British, foreign or Turkish gold, or British or Turkish silver. 9 The Maria Theresa dollar is scarce owing to the official prohibition against its import into the country, and at the same time the current com of the place, and is essential for all commercial and domestic purposes. The above 713 F.D.anomaly is not denied by the local authorities, who are obliged to have recourse to its use in order to pay for supplies purchased locally and for transport; be sides, there is no alternative to receiving same when offered as payment for tithes and other taxes by the Yemen peasantry. 10 . I have already discussed this question of exchange with His Majesty’s Commercial Attache at Constantinople, who was at a less to suggest a remedy and was of opinion that the existing evil and the pecuniary loss resulting there from were inevitably allied with other disadvantages incidental to service in the hopeless Ottoman province of Yemen alone. 11 . I would therefore request that you will be good enough to recommend to the Foreign Department of the Government of India that the hardship I suffer in this respect be carefully considered, 12 . I would further respectfully suggest for consideration as a partial remedy the following proposals: ( 1 ) that an exchange compensation or local allowance of fifty rupees (Rs. 50) per mensem be sanctioned as a permanent measure, in addition to the salary lam now receiving or such I may hereafter be in receipt of, while stationed in this part of Arabia ; or ( 2 ) that my salary be paid in dollars and the basis of exchange for conversion of rupees into dollars be fixed at the intrinsic value of the latter, viz. % Rs. 143J for 100 dolkis for the purposes of calculation; or ( 3 ) that the difference between the intrinsic value and the fictitious value represented by the rate of exchange on the first day of each month be paid to me as compensation. The current rate of exchange can be certified to by two merchants of this town. 13. May I be permitted to add in conclusion that a local personal allowance of rupees fifty per mens m was sanctioned by the Government of India in 1905 to the Vice-Consul at Jeddah, whose duties you will admit. Sir, are by no means as important and of as responsible a nature as these at Hodeida, and who does not labour in the same degree, under the serious inconveniences to te contend ed against here.

Rs. 1904 .. 140 134 136 1905 160 136 145b 1906 .. 177-| 163 165 . 3. During the past year, viz., 1907, the rate of exchange for 100 dollars varied between Rs. 165 and Rs. 175, and the average rate for the year was about Rs. 168 for 100 dollars. x 4. The low rate of exchange for the year 1904 noticeable in the above table was exceptional and attributable to the fact that a considerable quantity of dol lars poured into Hodeida from the interior for the pure! ase of food-stuffs owing to the severe famine prevalent throughout the Yemen during that year. There was at the same time no demand for Maria Theresa dollars locally for the pur chase of native produce, of which there was a marked scarcity. 5. The rates of exchange quoted have been obtained from commercial houses here, but those at which my salary was paid were even higher by one per cent. 6 . I beg to request you will be so kind as to recommer d to the Government of India that in the event of my application receiving favourable consideration, the local allowance or exchange compensation may be granted with retrospec tive effect from October 1907, as I have already suffered serious pecuniary loss in consequence of the fluctuations in exchange. 7.

It nemr* desirable at this stage to swmarise the course of recent correspondence regarding the Vice- Consulate at Hod&amp;ida. In a letter. do,ted 99 Feb. 1905, this Office informed the F.O. that the (r-ovt. of India hod drawn attention to the fact that £900 a year only was contributed towards the Vice-Consulate from Imperial revenues, and that ■hey considered that they would not be justified in accepting the whole cost (ah out £140 a year) of providing the Vice-Consul 7 PkViGe-Con'tul with extra office as'ietonce• The letter added that the Secretary of State in Council would hear half the cart, if the Treasury would hear the other half. The F,G, i in their reply* dated the PAth J'cvrch ISOS, stated that the Treasury were unahle to contribute the f70 a year in question. Looter, in a letter dated the 10th August 1CC5, this Office informed the F.C. that the Govt, of India hod with drawn their recommendation in favour of providing the extra assistance referred to, and there the matter rested. In ICO 5 attention was dr aim to the large expenditure incurred at the cost of Indian revenues hy the r ice—Consul in the sending of telegrams. The F.O. declined r in a letter coded ~he 30th Oct. 1905, to accept any liability on this account and the 1.0, rejoined, in a letter of 10th Jan. 1906, by drawing attention to the inadequacy of the Imperial contribution towards the Vise-Consulate ana explaining that the Govt, of India were being ashed for a statement showing to what extent expenditure ap the 'Ice-Consulate had increased since 1834, uihen it was fAOO a year only. On receiving thi ~ statement from the Govt, of India thi^ Office again addressed the F.O., in n letter dated 10th August 1906, pointing out that the average outlay at the Vice-Consulate was between 1600 and 1700 a year, towards which Imperial revenues contributed £200 a year only, and it was ashed that the irhole correspondence should be laid before the Treasury. In a Utter of ^ 14th 1'iro 1F07 the F.O. informed thi? Office that the Treasury hsd increased the Imperial contribution p'on £200 to £300 a year, but 'were 2 xd ’05 118$ r 05 J53o&lt;J ’05 /05Z 7 l)b ’0*[ unableN ( 1 ) 2qsq. 7 oy ■£QSi-l- ' ’oj ^±L 'unable to .^notion a half and half division of the 'expenditure ». Nothing was said to indicate that this increase in +hs Imperial contribution had anything to do with the proposal which had been before the Secy, of State in Council in IPO'S for giving the Consul extra office assistance. Subsequently, in a letter dated the 20th April 1907, ■he i’.0. jorwardsd to this Office a despatch from H.j r . Ambassador at Constantinople, recommending (l) an increase in ^he Vice-Consul’s salary from £&gt;320 a year to f&gt;350-£450 a year, and (2) the grant to him of extra office assistance at a cost (as before) of £140 a year. In its reply, dated the 27th Hay 1907, this Office first, pointed out that, the '_!rea,sury having declined to agree to an equal division of the cost of the Vice-Consulate 9 the -'hole co't of the increased expenditure thus recommended 1 'Oula j all on Indipn revenues, and the letter Cone hided :- ' «?• In these oirciMstances the Secy, of state in 'Council does not consider that the Indian interests ,r concerned Justify an increase in Or. Richardson's emoluments. 4* As regards the proposed increase of +he office establishment at an estimated maximum cost of £140 a year, n the Secretary of State in Council adheres to the view 'expressed in my letter of the 22nd Feb. 19OS and would be 'prepared to admit a moiety of the increased cost as a charge 'upon Indian revenues, provided that ^he remaining moiety be 'borne by the Imperial Exchequer'. The F.O. now forward, in a letter dated 19th Nov. 1907, correspondence v.nth the Treasury in which the latter contend that, when they sanctioned the increase of the Imperial contribution from £200 to £300 a year, their intention wo,s(1) to provide fundo for an immediate addition of *'140 a yea~ to the office allowance (of which sun the Govt, of India had explained their willingness to pap half), and (2) to provide a margin for any further additions in the near jutuxe. It was certainly never understood here that such was the intention. Application was made Toy this Office for an increase of the Imperial cont-^ihution to adjust more equitably between the two Governments the burden of existing expenditv.re, not to provide in any way for expenditure still to he incurred, and it was believed that the application had been favourably met b^ the Treasury to the extent above indicated. The position is unsatisfactory, but the explanation given by the Treasury, as to their intention, mns+, i+ is submitted, be accepted by this Office, especially as the letters which passed between the F.O. and ■Treasury p^ior to the F.O. letter to us of the 14th 1 larch 1107, of which copies have been unofficially obtained from the F.O., seem to give some ground for the Treasury explanation of their own position. Meanwhile, the interests of the vioe-Consulate are suffering, as is clear from Fir w. O'Conor's strongly-worded despatch of the 27th August last. The following draft is submitted.

A proposal had, u&gt; is true, been earlier under discussion for providing the Vice-Consul with extra assistance at a cost of about £140 a year, but, so far as this Dept, was concerned, it was believed that the consideration of the proposal had been definitely conclipdsd, when the intimation was made to you in a letter dated 10th August 190-5, that the Govt, oj India nod w 1 1hdrawn their previous recommendation in favour of th^ proposal . p. Subsequently, the attention oj ihis Dept. was independently drawn to the whole question of the .adequacy of the contribution made by the Imperial Exchequer in respect of the Vice- Consulate, owing to the large expend iture which was found to have been incurred at the cost of Indian revenues in the sending of certain telegrams by the Vice-Consul. For this expend iture the S. of S. for Foreign Affairs was unable to accept any liability, as announced in your lent ter of* the 30th (3$3o/of) October 1905, and it was stated in reply, in my letter of the 10th Jan. 1905, that the Secretary of State in Council could not regard the Imperial contributionily (/esz/oG) °1 APPROVED COUNCIL 7 JAN. 1908 conbribucion of ^£200a year as mg trie liability which equitably be undertaken by the Imperial Exchequer: it was added that the Govt, of India had be..n ashed to furnish a statement as to vne increase of expenditure at vine Vi ce-eonsulaie since 1884 'with a view to a reconsideration of the whole qaesvion oj vne incidence of the charge'. Tl„s is at emenv, afverwards f orwardea in my letter of the 10th August 1906, snowed that the average outlay on the Vice-Consulate was between 68600 ana 68700 a year, and the opinion was expressed that vne importance of the Vice-Consulate was as great from the Imperial as the Tndian point of view. f. Cn the receipt, therefore, of your letter of the 14th March 1907 it was supposed that the increase of the Imperial contribution by the round sum of 68100 a year was a step towards effecting what was held by this Dept, to be a more equitable adjustment between the two Governments of the burden of existing expenditure; the increase was not thought to be in any way connected with proposals for improv ing the efficiency of the Vice-Cons late, such as those which had been earlier under discussion as to the office expenditure.&gt; In view, however, of the explanation nOaj furnished by the Lords Oonvnrs • as to o'/ieir intention in sanctioning the in, ci eased contribution from Imperial revenues t a/nd also of the importance attached by Sir I.

I can only say that it appears to me to be a matter of deep regret that at a moment when it is admitted on all sides that we should make a strenu ous effort to foster British trade in this Empire, and that Hodeidah is becoming a port of very con siderable importance, we should be prevented from doing anything to uphold our interests by a dispute ir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P., , &amp;c t ^ u&amp;C.as to the proper method of paying a sum of little over £100 a year. I feel strongly that I cannot take the respon- sihility of accepting this decision without urging you most earnestly to give the matter your further consideration and to press the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury to sanction the necessary expenditure. It seems to me impossihle to admit that an understanding, such as that of 1887 which, the .treasury cite, as to the importance of Imperial in terests at a particular place, can he meant to hold good for ever however much circumstances may change, and equally Impossihle to deny that in this case circumstances have greatly changed. On the other hand I do think that the Treasury might he justified in declining to hear the entire cos., of the post, as they would presumably have to do, if, in accordance with the suggestion at the end of your Despatch it were proposed to include the Hodeidah Vice Consulate in the Levant Service.I therefore venture to hope that my original proposals may he put forward once more and pressed as strongly as possible. I would add that, as Dr. Richardson tells me, the increase in the contribution of the Treasury made last March does not in any way affect his emoluments but merely relieves the Indian Exchequer to a proportionate extent.

TREASURY CHAMBERS, 12th Novenber 1907 Slr:- I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury Mr. Langley's letter (33483/07) of the 29th ultimo recommending that the Imperial contribution towards the expenses of the Vice Consu-^d late at Hodeida should be increased by £110 per an num, in order to provide for additions (which would be divided equally between the Imperial and Indian Exchequers) of £140 per annum to the office allowance and £30 per annum (calculated apparently at the mean of the scale) to the salary of the post. In reply I am to request that you will submit the following observations to Secretary Sir E. Grey. •In Sir E. Gorst's letter of 4th March 1905 it was proposed by the Marquess of Lansdowne that, in order to provide for additional office expenditure at Hodeida of £140 per annum (the items of which are identical The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.— identical with those constituting the addition of £140 now recommended) the fixed contribution from Imperial funds should he increased from £200 to £270 per annum, on the understanding that all other ex penditure would he borne, as heretofore, by Indian funds. The Board of Treasury were, however, as in timated in Their letter 4424/05 of 20th March 1905, unable to assent to this increase. On August 51st, 1905, My Lords were invited by q ir E. Barrington’s letter 27654, to reconsider this decision and by Their Letter (15922/06) of the 7th March 1907, while declining to agree to a half and half division of the cost of this post with the Indian Government, They sanctioned the increase of the Im perial contribution from £200 to £500 per annum. The intention of My Lords in assenting to this increase was (1) to provide funds for an immediate addition of £140 per annum (of which the Indian Gov ernment had expressed its willingness to pay one half) to the office allowance in accordance with the only proposal made by your Department, viz: that originally put forward on 5th March 1905, and (2) to provide ammmmmKmsi a margin for any further additions in the near future In these circumstances Their Lordships are sur prised to learn that, so far, the Vice Consul has ieceived no benefit from the increase of the Imper- !■ ial contribution, and They can only point out that if the increase is applied to the purposes for which ‘ m it uas given it will practically be sufficient to J w cover the cost of the additions to the emoluments of the A/ice Consul for which -application is made in the letter under reply.

With reference to the correspondence which took lace in 1905 between the Foreign Office and India Office, ending with Sir E. Gorst's letter of the i 24th March of that year, I have the honour to trans mit copy of a letter, which I have received from Mr. Richardson, again raising the question of the status of the British Vice Consulate at Hodeidah. Mr. Richardson was lately in Constantinople and I had several interesting conversations with him, ' which left on my mind a very favourable impression of his ability and energy. Mr. Richardson discussed with me at length the excellent opening which he, rightly I think, believeqV to exist for British trade in Hodeidah and the sur rounding Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P., CXjC . , &lt;UiC ■ , cxC •surrounding regions of Arabia. At present this country is almost untapped and such trade as there is, remains in the hands of the Italians, who main tain a Consulate General at Hodeidah. In particu lar, Mr. Richardson thinks that the cotton trade might well be pushed, if care /ere taken to meet local requirements. But it is not only in the field of trade that there is an opportunity for Brit ish activity, it is believed that the interior of the country is rich in minerals, and if Mr. Richard son were free to travel there, he conceives that he would be able to furnish most useful confidential re ports on this subject. Moreover, the present moment is opportune for endeavouring to promote British Trade and Industry, as not only are there as yet no competitors other than Italian, but the Arabs are well-disposed toward the English and would welcome an opportunity of trading with them. But if any use is to be made of the opportunit which I believe to exist, it is obviously necessar; thatwm HP 1 «« ■ that further assistance must he given to Mr. Richard-; son in his work, and it is only fair that his remu neration should he placed on a scale similar to that of other Vice Consuls. With regard to the work of the Vice Consulate, it has already been admitted to the full both by the Foreign Office and the Government of India that Mr. Richardson requires an increase of £140 in his of fice allowance, hut the Foreign Office refused to contribute anything towards this amount and the Gov ernment of India refused to pay the whole. The pro^ posal therefore dropped. In my opinion it is im- possible any longer to contend that there are no British interests at Hobeidah apart from those of India, and I cannot tTut think that His Majesty's Gcv eminent should bear half the cost of any addition that may be made to the expenditure of the post. Ab regards the amount of such addition, in the first place it appears to me to be quite unreason able that Mr. Richardson should be expected to per- form his duties for a salary so very much less thanUz ziis Colleagueb in t»h9 Lsvant } particularly HodQi- dah is. from the cost and inconvenience of living onere, a place at which a Levant Vice Consul would certainly be granted a local allowance. I would therefore suggest that Mr. Richardson should be placed on the usual scale of £350 - £450, his house being allowed him also, as at present. I would also strongly urge that the allowance for office expenditure, now about £160 should be in creased to £300. This would make it possible for Mr. Richardson to engage the services of a competent clerk to assist in the routine work of the office. He tells me that there are over 300 British In dians settled at Hodeidan,that the Consulate is fill-! ed daily.by claimants, that all his time is taken up in Office work, that he is unable to devote his at tention as he would wish to Commercial matters and that he has no hope of being able to do so, unless he be relieved of some of his work by a clerk. He therefore begs that such office allowance, as will cover this expenditure, ma? r be given to him. He wouldwould also 'be enabled to spend more time at Sana, which I consider to be very desirable, as the place is at present almost unknown and may have great pos sibilities as a market. I feel sure that parsimony in regard to such a Post as Hodeidah would be a bad policy and that money spent, is likely to be well invested; and I therefore venture to beg that His Majesty's Govern ment will give ray proposals their serious considera tion. I have dc.. (Signed) N. .R. O'Conor.—N ALEXANDRIA, March 24th, 1907. Sir:- I have the honour to put forward for Your Ex cellency’s kind consideration, the following repre sentations on the subject of my salary and office allowance at Hodeida. Since the establishment of the Vice-Consulate at Hodsida in 1884, the salary of the Vice-Consul has V been fixed at two hundred and forty pounds (£ stg 240) per annum rising by five annual increments of sixteen pounds each, to three hundred and twenty pounds (£ stg 320). In 1901, a house rented by the Government of India at thirty eight pounds yearly (£ stg 38) was rented for occupation by the Vice-Consul free of rent. I would respectfully beg to point out that cir cumstances at Hodeida have considerably changed since 1884 His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir N.R.O’Conor, G.C.B., G.C. .G. &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c .1884 in almost every respect, rendering the above salary insufficient for subsistence and quite in- adeqwte for the work entailed and the increased im portance of the post. ■flie original intention in creating the consular post at Hodeida, It would appear, was principally to afford assistance and advice to British Indian pil grims who were annually quarantined at Camaran en route to Mecca for the performance of the Haj . The Vice-Consul^ duties were almost solely con fined to the above pilgrim traffic previous to some ten yeen’s ago, since when commercial and political interests in the Yemen generally have demanded great er attention on the part of the Vice-Consul. At the same time the number of pilgrims passing through Camaran has nearly doubled. The salaries of many Vice-Consuls in the Ottoman dominions and at similar posts in the Persian Gulf range from £ stg 350 to £ stg 450 per annum. The nature of the work at Hodeida and the importance of the ccmmercial interests involved there and in the YemenYemen generally, I beg permission to represent, are by no means inferior to the above and therefore call for remuneration on an equal basis. The cost of living at Hodeida is very much greater than that in other towns in the Ottoman Em pire or in Persia and from experience I can say it is indeed a more expensive place than others on the Syrian Coast or than Basra, Mohammerah, Bushire or any town in the Persian Gulf. The want of a fixed coinage in the Yemen, where Ottoman supremacy and Turkish administration are not yet quite firmly established, is a circumstance that contributes towards personal pecuniary loss by caus ing a marked depreciation of British gold and the Indian rupee, on which basis my salary is calculated. This is brought about by the currency in the country of the TT aria Teresa dollar, which besides being sub- ject to almost dally fluctuations In value. Is very scarce owing to the strict prohibition against Its T importation into the vilayet. It is nevertheless thethe coinaee most ordinarily adopted In comnercial and domestic transactions. The inconvenience oT being isolated in the scorching and enervating climate of the Red Sea and in an unique oriental town where the conditions of life are barely tolerable Is an element that is gen erally taken into consideration in fixing the salar ies of consular officers at similar, though less un healthy, tropical posts. I therefore humbly beg to request that Your Ex cellency will be so kind as to recommend to His Majesty^ Government that a revision of the salary of the Mode Ida Vi ce-Consulate must be considered and that it be placed on a more equitable basis. I would suggest that the salary be fixed at a minimum of £ stg 350 per annum rising to £ stg 450 per annum by four equal increments of £ stg 25 year ly, further that the consular residence be continued to be granted free of rent. The maximum salary would, in my case, be attained after ten years’ sor-service, as six years have already been passed in my present position. Passing to the subject of an increased staff, it would be as well to state that the latter consists at present of (l) a dragoman on £ stg 96 per annum, (2) a cavass on twenty five pounds; and ( 3 ) a door keeper on fifteen pounds yearly. There is also an allowance of ten pounds (£ stg 10) per annum for stationery and petty expenses, and the sum of fifteen pounds (£ stg 15) is paid for the annual rental of the office. Briefly, the office allowance disbursed at Hodeida amounts annually to one hundred and sixty-one pounds (£161) which is very much less than that of my Italian colleague. I represented in detail in December 1903 in a despatch submitted through the Jeddah Consulate, the considerable extent to which consular work at Hodeida had increased during the past decade and hav. now only to add that this statement has been still further borne out since, and that the public servlethae made greater demands on the utility of the Vico- Consulate at Hodeida. The recommendations of His Majesty's Fmbassy to the Foreign Office in 1904 on this subject. It will he remembered, were in short, as follows (a) the pro vision of a clerk to assist In the routine work of the Consulate; (b) entertainment of the services of a A cavaBs to accompany the Vice-Consul on hi e annual l visit to Camaran on behalf of British Indian pilgrims and (c) of the grant of a small additional office allowance. The necessity for the extra cavass has since been accentuated in that his services are essential with the Vice-Consul during his Yemen tours which precede the pilgrim season. The total cost of putting into execution the above recommendations submitted by Your Excellency, were estimated by the Government of India at one hundred and forty pounds (£ stg 140) annually. His Majesty's Indian Government expressed its readinessto boar one moiety oi the proposed additional expen diture on the Vice-Consulate conditionally that the other moiety would be forthcoming from Imperial funds. Owing, however, to the disinclination of the Home Treasury tc sanction the sum of seventy pounds (£ stg 70) as the Imperial contribution, the Govern ment of India were reluctantly obliged to hold the proposals in abeyance. This was, notwithstanding the fact that both His T ajesty's then Princlapl Secre taries of State for foreign Affaire and for India respectively concurred in the joint opinions of the Indian Government and of Your Excellency, that a case had been made out for extra clerical assistance for the Hodelda Vice-Consulate. 1 can assure Your Fxcellency that the work at the Vice-Consulate at Hodelda where there are more than three hundred British subjects and where the total volume of trade, mainly in British hands, ex ceeds a million sterling, compares very favourably with that of Jeddah that has both a Consul and Vice- Consul ana a big staff. TheThe Vice-Consulate at Hocieida deale with the Hi whole vilayet of Yemen where there are no other British Consular posts established and where the prospects of increased trade with Men and the open ings for British commercial enterprise in the Interior, known to abound in mineral products, are very hopeful in the near future. Good results may only be anticipated by afford ing facilities to a British official to visit such districts occasionally, who by cultivating friendly relations with the Ottoman officials and local inhabitants would be able to obtain and furnish use ful information regarding mineral deposits. The circumstances, in my humble opinion, justify the creation of an additional consular post at Sana*a or elsewhere in the Yemen. May I be permitted to observe that Italy whose commercial and political interests in this vilayet are unimportant is represented by a salaried Consul- General at ModeIda and a salaried Vice-Consul at ■ okha. —I would venture to suggest, lor the present, that Your 'Xceilency s s previous recommendations on the suoject or an increased stall at Hodelda be renewed to His Majesty's foreign Olllce with a request that the Treasury be induced to bear a moiety ol the pro posed additional expenditure, in view ol the Impor tant Imperial interests involved at that place .

K« proposes to disnioB the draeotaan on the first opportunity, and it will apparently be necessary, in order to secure a suitable nan for the appointment to offer hin the full pay at present drawn by the holder of the post. The temporary arrangement now proposed for increasing the pay of tho cavass, and for entertaining a second carass would then cone to an end ns there would no longer be any savings available to provide for tho extra charges. 4# 1 lim directed to nay that in the opinion of the Covernnent of India, it would not be advisable to adopt the course suggested. If the present cayass's pay were raised to three pounds a month, it would be difficult to reduce it again to two pounds, on the appointment of a competent dragoman, and. the reduction of tho present dragoman^ pay in the manner proposed could only he expected to have the result of making him more useless and unreliable than he is at present. 5 * Aa whole difficulty appears to hare arisen owing to the unsuitability of the present holder of the postpoet of dragoaan. It eeena donirr.ble that no tiise should be lost in dispensing with his services, if this can be done without difficulty. I &lt;un to sxiggest that, if no properly qualified candidate is available to fill hie place, the present consular oavass, who is described by Dr. Bichard con as a very intelligent find competent officer, might be temporarily placed in charge of the duties of drago- man, another nan being entertained as cavass in his place.

A copy of a Despatch addressed to the Government of India is enclosed, and of their reply, from which it will be seen that they adhere to the views stated in their letter No. 236, of the 8th December 1901 (which w^as forwarded to you with my letter of the 22nd February 1905), viz., that the considerations which led His Majesty’s Government to accept the principle of a half and half division of the charge in 18S4 for this Vice-Consulate are equally applicable now. It appears from the figures now forwarded by the Government of India that the average outlay is between 600/. and 700/. a year, towards which the Imperial Treasury only contributes the sum of 200/., which was fixed in 1887. The Secretary of State in Council cannot regard this contribution as any longer representing adequately the Imperial interest in this Vice-Consulate; and, without repeating the arguments, stated in my previous letters, he would urge that the whole corres pondence on this subject should be laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, with a view to their reconsidering their position in the matter, as stated in Sir G. Murray’s letter to your Department of the 20th March 1905. Mr. Morley has little doubt that Sir E.

Sir:- I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.47 dated the 17th of June, 1905 for- vvaidi 115 an application from the Vice-Consul at Hodei- dah for an additional grant of Rs: 350/ on account of extraordinary telegraphic expenditure and for a grano oi Rs:150/ on account of his annual entertain ment allowance. 2. The former item is said to be required on account oi the necessity of reporting by telerraph to His Britannic Majesty's Embassy at Constantinople tne progress of events in the Yemen Vilayet. The ex penditure is being, incurred under the orders of His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador, and I am to say that in tnese circumstances the Government of India do not consider that it can legitimately be debited to Indi revenues.

I have now the honour to inform you that the charges for soate telegrams up to djfolii amount to Rs:2035 and that sanction for a further grant of Rs:435 will be required to cover the excess incurr ed . It is also proposed that the Government of In- dia be asked for a grant of Rs:455 for expenditure in telegrams uo be utilized during the remainder of the current year. G.P. Devey, Esq, Jeddah.It will fee seen that with the sanction of ■■ * 8 the additional funds applied for on two occasions since the Budget Estimates were passed, the figures for the above item will he brought up to Ks! 2500. I have no special explanation to offer for the seemingly abnormal expenditure as compared to S I ! i V fc ' that of previous years, other than it was incurred almost solely in messages of a political nature, and more so in replying to communications received from His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople. The Arab revolt in this province which has almost been quelled accounted for a great portion of the increased correspondence by telegraph, while piracies in Yemen littoral of the Ked Sea recently have added to the same. The accounts of this Vice-Consulate for the year 1902-1905 shew an expenditure of Ks. 1240,. under the head of 'Telegrams', and those of 1905-1904, and 1904-1905, Ks: 1400, and Hs.850 respectively, whereas in the.current year they will most probably amount to about Hs:2500. InIn view of tne recent correspondence that has passed oetween the Indian and Imperial Governments witu reference to the reapportionment of the burden of maintaining this Vice-Consulate, perhaps it may not be out of place to point out that nine tenths of the amounts shewn above as expended in telegrams during tne past four years, were incurred on behalf of Imperial interests against the annual contribution of £200 from the Horne Exchequer.

I have &amp;c., (Signed) N. R. O'Conor. His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Copy. \ No. Hi. H 0 D E I D A . October 4th, 1905. Sir:- I have the honour to submit the following report on the subject of a claim for Rs.7,355 (£490) forward ed to this Vice-Consulate by the Political Resident at Aden on the 21st ultimo. i The above sum represents the value of a cargo of dates, grain, flour, sugar, etc., shipped by one, Shereef Mahomed Hassan Rifay of Aden on the British sambook 'Alwani', that was robbed in June last at Ras Majamela by Zereneek pirates, while on her way from Aden to Medi, (see my despatch No. 83 of June 28th). I immediately requested of the Political Resi dent that a sworn statement of the petitioner be taken and sent to me. The owner who is in possession of a passport from the Aden Residency and described as a British subject, is G. P. Devey, Esq. , F.R.G.S. , His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Jeddah. i * m mj ttis a brother to Shereef Ahrned Hassan, the subject of whose .nationality is dealt with in niy Despatch to you No. 100 of the 13th August last. The applicant in this case besides being bom in Aden has been resident there all his life. Having inferred from telegraphic correspondence with His Majesty's Ambassador that this claim should only be supported if there was irrefutable evidence of the bona fide ownership of the cargo as contended, t I referred the matter to Aden for further information which has been duly furnished me since. The Political Resident informed me by telegraph that e was satisfied that Shereef Mahomed Hassan was the real proprietor of the goods robbed from the 'Alwani'. I lea^n from the latter's agent here that he pro duced documentary evidence to shew that the cargo be- longed to him and that he was the actual shipper of the same. In support of his claim to the property that was robbed, an entry from the books of the Aden PortPort Trust was shewn. The value of the various articles was declared before the Aden Magistrate and a detailed list of the items has been furnished to this Vice-Consulate. The delay in presenting his claim for compensa tion is explained by the petitioner as being due to his not having precise information as to the amount of { Ms property stolen, obliging him to send men to Ho- deida to make full enquiries. About six weeks ago, the brother of the owner mentioned the fact to me that he proposed submitting a claim for compensation on behalf of the Aden pro prietor. I replied that satisfactory proof would be required to establish a bona fide.ownership of the goods and that as the shipper v/as in Aden, he had better approach the authorities there and produce the necessary documents in support thereof. * .1 learn that the principal cauee of the delay was due to the mischievous interference of the father of the Aden merchant, an Ottoman subject, who without lu i If thethe knowledge or concurrence of his son accepted a private assurance from the local authorities that the goods would be recovered, and that it was quite unnecessary that their owner should apply to the Aden Residency for assistance in obtaining their restitu tion. It has been ascertained from the petition for warded to the mutasarrif of Hodelda by the aforesaid Ottoman subject immediately after the occurrence of the piracy, that the merchandise were described as be longing to a foreigner resident at Aden. Later on, f « S*' » f in the presence of the Governor and myself this man stated that they belonged to his son in Aden, of whose nationality I had no knowledge at the time. The nakhuda of the barque 'Alwanl' when making his affidavit at the Consulate mentioned that the car go was shipped by Shereef Mahomed Hassan Rifay of Aden whom he erroneously described as a Turkish subject. In my despatch No. 83 I have remarked that the owner of the 'Alwani's' cargo was a Turkish subject. I was then under the impression that both the father at Hodeida and son at Aden were partners and of the sameI ! ■■■ ■ same nationality. In short, in view of the opinion expressed by the Political Resident and the result of njy inquiries I am convinced that the petitioner Shereef Mahomed Hassan Rilay is the rightful and genuine proprietor of the merchandise that was pirated. The captain of His Majesty's Ship 'Fox' was ac quainted of the facts of this claim by the Aden au thorities and it was ultimately decided that we should include this among our demands, with reference to the ' * piracy question. v 141 I have now the honour to inform you, with satis faction, that the local authorities intimated to me a few days ago, that the claim would be admitted and the amount has since been handed over to me for transmission to Aden. They, however, added that the right to protest later was reserved to themselves, a step, I think that will hardly be taken. I thought that it was as well to finish the whole question with reference to this case at one time, whichwhich opinion has met with the approval of His Majes ty’s Ambassador. My reasons were firstly, that I am about to proceed on leave shortly and I considered that it would be unfair to shelve the matter till the arrival of my locum tenens, and also because the pre sence of His Majesty's Ship 'Fox' afforded an oppor tunity to press for a settlement, and I need hardly mention, caused the local officials to be more dis posed to do so.

To The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, Jlis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. posal to increase the establishment of the Vice-Consulate at Hodeidaand Ramaran, having regard to the present apportionment of the cost of the Vice- Consulate between Imperial and Indian revenues. TT ^ 2 * o In Mr# Courtne y ,s letter of the 22nd May 1884, addressed to the U ndei- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty s Treasury intimated their acceptance of an arrangement under which the cost of the Vice-Consulate was to he borne in equal shares by His Imperial Majesty’s Government and by the Government of India. Their assent was only obtained after strong representations had been made by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs^ pointing out the importance of the Imperial interests involved, and the necessity for a contribution being made from Imperial revenues. In 1887, when the question whether additional expenditure in respect of the Vice-Consulate should be undertaken came under discussion, an arrangement was eventually concluded, under which His Majesty’s Govern ment became liable for a fixed contribution of £200 a year only. This sum represented approximately half the annual expenditure prior to the year 1887 ; but, in view of the reluctance with which the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury had consented to bear any part of the cost, and in consideration of the fact that an increase in the establishment was held to be imperative in the interests of efficiency, the Government of India decided not to press His Majesty’s Government for a larger contribution. 3. We think it advisable that the Vice-Consul should have ample facilities for, and time to devote to, the promotion of commercial interests and the supply of intelligence, and we accordingly consider that the additional expenditure which he proposes should be incurred; but the considerations which led Her Majesty’s Government to accept the principle of a half-and-half division of the charges in 1884 are^equally applicable now; and we would refer, in this connection, to the recognition of the importance of the Imperial interests involved, contained in the present correspondence. We consider, therefore, that it would be inequitable to ask the Government of India to undertake all additional charges in excess of the contribution from His Majesty’s Government. There is, in our opinion, the greater objection to this, in view of the fact that the actual expenditure on the Vice-Consulate in 1902-03 amounted to £945, of which £200 only was borne by the Home Government. Any further^ increase in expenditure would result in the imposition of a quite dis proportionate burden on Indian revenues ; and, in view of the decision which W k / f Uwas formerly arrived at in respect of the equality of interests, we consider that ment the C ° St ° f the present P ro P osals should be borne by His Majesty’s Govern- We have the honour to be, Sm, ^ our most obedient, humble servants, ttzrlL J'P r l^r-^CCSir:- I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to transnilt to you, to be laid before the Secretary of ' \' jpi ^ / Sta^e for India in Council, the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Ambassador at Con stantinople forwarding and recommending an applica tion for an increase of the travelling Allowance as signed to Mr. G.

I have the honour to state that the area for v/nich Intelligence is called for is most extensive, ji ciiid. It would take several years to ok tain complete iniormation on all pointson the lines laid down in the above instructions. Besides being single-handed, and the only polit ical or Consular oiiicer in the Ottoman sphere of Yemen, you are no doubt aware of the difficulties the foreign intelligence officer has to contend with in the Turkish Dominions and more so in this Vilayet. The \ G.P.Devy Esq., Jeddah.The local authorities, being naturally sus picious of the presence of foreigners generally in Arabia, place insurmountable barriers in the way of one who seeks for information, as for ex ample by prohibiting Arabs or Turkish officials from visiting him. The establishment of friendly relations with the Vali of the province has to a certain extent tended to inspire confidence as to the real ob ject of my having established a summer residence at Sana'a, so much so that His Excellency cordial ly invited me to repeat rny visit to the capital this year. lily knowledge of Arabic and free intercourse % with the civil said military ofiicials, as well as with the principal Aral Sheikhs in the Vicinity of Sana*a have placed certain facilities in the way of acquiring the necessary information hy de grees . I have made notes of the journey doth of geographical and military interest during the two trips undertaken into the interior last summer.I am not without hope of obtaining the greater part of. the information required and placing reliable 'W J &gt; &gt; intelligence about the Yemen in the hands of the Government of India although the same may take a few years to accomplish. It is my intention to leave again for Sana'a on or about the 15th of June next and after a resi dence of three months there return to Hodeidah, after visiting the principal towns bordering on the British sphere of influence, en route to Aden and going over part of the territory recently delimited by the joint Anglo-Turkish commission. The Turk jealously closes his gates to all foreigners, as has been instanced during the past few years in the case of certain missionaries and other travellers. It is most desirable that I should avail myself of the opportunities now offered of visiting and re porting on various parts of this province about whichAs travelling in Yemen is of necessity very expensive and quite out of tlie reach of my slender resources I leg to request you will kindly recom mend to the Government of India that financial as sistance he afforded me in the interests of the public service. The sanctioned allotment of the Budget Esti mates of the Vice Consulate, under the head of 'Travelling Allowance' for the current year is seven hundred rupees and the actual expenses of an annual visit to Sana*a and a trip through such parts of the Vilayet as is practicable may be met from the above if the same were increased by five hundred rupees. I respectfully venture to suggest that should the Government of India approve of my meeting the travelling expenses of the journey as proposed, its sanction will be conveyed to me directly by telegraph, to enable me to proceed to Sana’a by the middle of next month if possible.

The present establishment consisting of a Drago man who is also Arabic Clerk,a Cavass and a door keeper, was assigned in 1884 when this Consulate v/as first opened. During the nineteen years that have elapsed, Brit ish interests in the Yemen, commercial and political as you are aware have greatly increased. G. P. Devey Esq., His Britannic Majesty's Consul Jeddah.this Consulate is over 300, and there are a great many Indian subjects unregistered and distributed throughout this vilayet that look for support in time of need. British merchants are also establishing new businesses at Hodeida, and in short, British trade which predominates is daily gaining ground. The above circumstances have entailed a consider able increase of work in the Consulate which the addition of important political duties has contributed - I to further augment. You are. Sir, in the best position to judge of I: i'fre numerous reports and despatches relating to the Yemen, political and commercial, that have to he submitted by me through you to His Majesty's Em- bassy and the Foreign Office. These necessitate correspondence in triplicate jj exclusive of office drafts and copies. Orders were recently issued to furnish reports on the Yemen to the Political Resident at Aden, with whomwhom there is much other correspondence. Regular and complete commercial reports of this district are also now rendered, the compilation of which demand much trouble and labour, especially in collecting statistics, as no information can be expect ed from the local Custom house in that respect. Police cases, suits between British and foreign subjects, and claims against the local government are * none too fev; at Hodeida and throughout this district where there are no Consular agencies. Last hut not least, are the important duties of my post at Camaran, in connection with the annual pilgrimage to the Hedjaz. In the execution of the various duties above enumerated, I am without the assistance of an English clerk, which is most essential. As explained to j you during my visit to Jeddah, for the past eighteen months, owing to pressure of work, I have had to write and copy my reports at night, and to engage a private clerk temporarily at my own expense.I therefore heg to put forv/ard the following proposals for kind consideration of His Majesty's (l) The entertainment of a clerk, well conver sant with English, who may be also appointed Regis trar of the Consular Court, on a salary of £80 per annum rising to £100 by five equal annual incre ments of £4 each. suitable man, knowing English and Arabic v/ell possessing other minor qualifications could not be obtained for a smaller remuneration, owing to dearness of living at Hodeida and adverse climatic conditions. It will be necessary to secure the services of a man to fill the post from Aden, Egypt or Bey- rout. This addition to my staff will relieve me of minor routine work and the submission of accounts and ordinary returns but will enable me to devote greater attention to more important affairs. (2) r(2) The appointment of an extra cavass on £25 * 1 ^ per annum plus an initial outfit allowance of £5. During my residence at Camaran I find it neces sary to take the Consular Cavass with me, who has a considerable amount of work during the detention of pilgrims at the Lazaret. There is also sufficient business to keep one employed at Hodeida during the above period, and I find it necessary to send my Cavass to and fro be- tv/een Hodeida and Cainaran at great inconvenience to myself. (3) The office allowance of £10 annually based on requirements in 1884, is insufficient and hardly covers stationery charges. There are many incidental expenses among v/hich may be mentioned the provision of coffee and cigar ettes in accordance with the Custom in Arabia, during the frequent visits of the local authorities andincurred. I In conclusion, I beg to assure you. Sir, that the above proposals are put forv/ard in the best in- | terests of His Majesty's service and it would be a great advantage if the necessary sanction could be obtained from the 1st of April 1904. In bringing to notice the increasing importance ; of Hodeida as a comnercial and political centre, might I be permitted to mention that Italy, whose I interests are very limited indeed, having barely a ! dozen subjects and three comnercial houses, hitherto represented by a trading Consu], has appointed a salaried Consular officer from the 1st of January next at Hodeida, Signor Sola, who holds the rank of lj[ Consul General.

Sir:- I have the honour to inform you that should local circumstances permit and there he no urgent or important public business to detain me, I propose to leave for Sana'a shortly after the 25th instant. The Yemen authorities here assured me that the road between this and Sana'a is perfectly safe and , that the Capital itself is quite secure and that proper lav; and order have been established there. This appears to agree with the information in my possession. I have not yet decided what route I shall take and what course will be adopted on my return. I on anxious to traverse the tract of country between Sana'a and Taiz and thence travel to Mokha, from which port I can embark for Hodeida. My stay at the Capital under ordinary circum stances Y/ill extend till the end of September, and Dr. S.M. Hussain, K.B., Acting British Consul, Jeddah.I hope to he hack again at Hodeida hy the 15th of Octooer at the latest. I informed the Government of India while on leave of my intention to spend part of the summer at Sana'a and that the cost of the journey there and hack would he debited to them as usual; adequate provision , having been already made in the Budget to meet the proposed expenditure. The. Indian Government have been generous enough to supply me with a hill tent and some camp accessories., to facilitate my travels. I have also ordered a few Scientific instruments from home, to enable me to make certain observations of the road &amp;c. Two copies of this despatch are being forwarded to the Embassy direct, to save time. I have &amp;c., (Signed) G.A. Richardson. His Majesty's Vice Consul.The chief increases occur under the heads of Travelling Allowances, Telegrams and Postage, House-rent Allowance, and Estao1ishnent charges. It seems clear from the correspondence that these increases have heen incurred partly at least in the interests of the Imperial Government. In his letter of the 22nd Pehruary 1904 the British Amhassador at Constantinop1e, in recommending the grant of additional denial assistance to Hr. Richardson, stated that 'our” (? Imperial and Indian) trade and political interests are of great importance in the Yemen and i is right that the vice Consul should be free to devote his time uo their encouragementt Later in the same year the Ambassador stronglv i ecommenaea an increase of 1r• Richardson f s travelling allowance no. Rs. !00 to Rs. 1200 a year, a measure which v. . r as sanctioned by the Government of India. The question of the extent wo wdeh Impe; ial interests have been concerned in tne costly telegrams of phepast four :’ ears seeas doubtful, but there can be little doubt, ^“ e -' were involved to some extent. On the whole there is a gooo case, I think, for asking the Treasury to increase their ^contribution,though, as remarked by 'r.

I request, therefore, that you will furnish me with a detailed statement of the heads of service under which the expenditure has increased since 1887, with a view to reopening the whole question of the incidence of the charge, should the nature of the increase be found to justify such a course. 16815. 1.91.

Witli rererence to previous correspondence between this Office and the India Office on the subject of Hodeidah, I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to transmit the accompanying cony of a Despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Jeddah to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, enclosing correspondence which has passed between him and the Government of India relative to the telegraphic expenditure recently incurred by the Vice-Consulate at Hodeidah. In forwarding the correspondence the Ambassador observes that the expenditure incurred by the Vice-Consul was due to the negotiations connected with the Alwani piracy case, and that the telegrams sent by the Embassy on the same' subject have been paid for out of Imperial funds. I am to state that in any circumstances the Imperial contribution towards the cost of the Vice-Consulate is in aid of all charges, and that Lord Lansdowne cannot accept liability for the cost of the telegrams sent by the Vice-Consul. &gt; 11th October 1905. I have the honour to transmit herewith the accompanying copy of a Despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Jeddah, enclosing ^corre spondence which has passed between him and the Government of India relative to the telegraphic expenditure recently incurred by the Vice- Consulate at Hodeidah. I would observe that the heavy expenditure incurred lately by Mr. Richardson has been due to the negotiations connected with the Alwani Piracy case, the various stages and 'settlement of which I have had the honour to report to your Lordship, and in which solely British Indian subjects were concerned.

Gorst’s letter of the 30th October last relative to the telegraphic expenditure recently incurred by the Vice- Consul at Hodeida, and to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the correspondence has been referred to the Government of India. I am at the same time to observe that Vice-Consul Richardson states that a great portion of the increased telegraphic charge is accounted for by the Arab revolt in Yemen, and that “ nine-tenths of the amounts “ shown above as expended in telegrams during the past four years “ were incurred on behalf of Imperial interests.” These statements, in the opinion of the Secretary of State in Council, confirm the view that it is not the protection of exclusively Indian interests, but of interests in which the Imperial and Indian Governments are jointly concerned, that has caused the increased expenditure on the Vice-Consulate at TIodeida, which ‘See Government of India letter, date,] is s h own by the Government of 8th December 1904, ]So. 230 (Secret), enclosed i with letter to Foreign Office of 22nd Emta to ha\ e risen to 94o/.

Put the amount of the increased cost now thrown upon Indian revenues is such, and the scope of the appointment has undergone so considerable an extension of recent years, that the Secretary of State in Council cannot regard the contribution fixed in 1887 as representing any longer the liability which should equitably he borne by the Imperial Exchequer. He has, therefore, desired the Government of India to furnish a statement showing in detail the heads of service under which the increased expenditure has been incurred,</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100029145977.0x000002_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/86/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100029145977.0x000002</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/86/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 2776/1905 Pt 2 ‘Arabia:- Jeddah Consulate.

The correspondents are ministers and senior officials at the Foreign Office, the India Office and the Treasury in London, the Consul and the Vice-Consul at Jeddah, the Governor General of India in Council and the secretaries at the Foreign Department of the Government of India in Calcutta and Simla [Shimla]. They discuss a pay increase in 1913 for the Indian cavass (government servant) Abdul Samad, employed at the Vice-Consulate to provide protection and aid to Indian pilgrims travelling to Mecca and Medina; the seasonal recruitment and rate of pay for a punkah-wallah (manual fan operator) at the Vice-Consulate in 1912; the grant of a personal allowance to Vice-Consul and Assistant Surgeon Dr Abdur Rahman in 1912 and to his predecessors Dr S Muhammad Hussein and Dr Abdur Razzak, in 1905 and 1895 respectively. There is also extensive correspondence between 1909 and 1910 about Foreign Office proposals to increase the fixed annual contribution made from Government of India revenues towards the cost of maintaining the Jeddah Consulate, and a counter proposal from the India Office suggesting that the annual Indian contribution should be reduced.  Included in the correspondence for 1909 is a statistical table showing the total cost of the Jeddah Consulate during the preceding three years (folio 74). The earliest correspondence dates from  1900 and discusses an anticipated reduction in the total amount of annual charges to be transferred from the revenues of India to those of the United Kingdom (also referred to as the Imperial revenues), in view of  the recommendation made by the  Royal Commission on the Administration of Expenditure of India (also referred to as the Welby Commission) about the equal division of charges between the Government of India and the Government of the United Kingdom (also referred to as the Imperial Government).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100029145977.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
