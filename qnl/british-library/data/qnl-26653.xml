General Legentilhomme said it was quite impossible for anything to happen on the island of Dumeira without his being informed. He reminded me that there was a French police post of Dumeira on the coa^t and that French aircraft made reconnaissance flights over the island at least once a month. He himself on the 12th July last had, with the Air Officer Commanding at Aden, flown over Dumeira at a height of thirty metres and had demonstrated that there were no military works of any sort on the island. The ''gun'* was an abandoned topographical mark. 3. According to General Legentilhomme the position at Dumeira has not changed since the spring of 1938 when a landing was made on the island, photographs taken and a detailed/ His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of c tate for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, S.

There is nothing to show whether the gun sighted by the British aircraft has been mounted by the French or the Italians but it seems desirable to remind the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs of their undertaking to keep His Majesty’s Embassy informed of any developments and their request to the Ministry of the Colonies to watch for any move by the Italians to occupy or fotify the Island.

Secret . 3 BRITISH EMBASSY, PARIS. January 25th, 1939. My Lord, His Majesty 1 s Minister on January 24th made an enquiry of the Political Director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with regard to the Island of Dumeira in accordance with the instructions contained in oaragraph 4 of Your Lordship’s Secret despatch No. 192 (J 205/13/66) of January 23rd. 2. M. Charveriat said that, although he had no very recent information, the Island of Dumeira, so far as he knew, had not been occupied by the Italians.’ The French Government’s reply to the Italian note denouncing the Franco- Italian Agreement of 1935 had made it clear that the French Government did not consider that agreement as dead, but, on the contrary, that it still provided a good basis for the regulation of the questions with which it had dealt. The oosition was that, should the Italians change their present frame of mind, and indicate their willingness, after all, to settle these questions on this basis, the French Government would be morally bound to agree. In that case, the Island of Dumeira, though it had meantime reverted to the status it had occupied before the signature of the agreement of 1935, would/ The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc. , etc., etc.would be subject to the terms of that instrument, and become Italian. The question of its status was in fact in suspense. M. Charveriat gave the impression that considered the French Government to be precluded from seeking to change their intentions with regard to Dumeira as expressed in the 1935 treaty, so long as the Question of Italian claims had not again been discussed between the two Governments: he was unwilling to be drawn on the questions whether, in any such discussions, an attempt would be possible to vary the terms of the 1935 agreement in respect of the Island, or, whether, if that agreement ceased to form the basis of such discussions, the French Government would seek to withdraw their recognition under Article 6 of Italian sovereignty over it. 3. M. Cherveriat having then telephoned to the head of the African section to enquire whether there was any fresh information with regard to Dumeira which he could give Mr. Campbell, stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had requested the Ministry of the Colonies to watch developments at the Island and to report any movements by the Italians for its occupation, A French aeroplane had flown over the Island at low altitude on January 23rd and had detected no sign of human life. As for the juridical status of the Island, this was at the moment governed by the Franco-Italian Agreement of 1900, by which, according to M. Charveriat, the two Powers agreed that it should be under the joint sovereignty of France and Italy ('a sort of New Hebrides”)? but agreed also that neither Power should exercise that sovereignty, (see State Papers, Volume 94, pp 588 and 589). In reply to the question what the French Government would do if, in the circumstances, the Italian Government sought to occupy the Island, or in any way to exert their authority there/there &gt; M. Charveriat was unahle to say anything heyond indicating that such a development would he a matter for consideration 4. M. Gharveriat undertook that the Ministry would keep His Majesty’s Embassy informed if there were any developments in respect of the Island, and if by any chance the French Government decided on any action with regard to its status, 5. From the foregoing I gather that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to persuade the French Government not to cede Dumeira under any future arrangement which might be concluded with the Italian Government so long as they are unaware of the real nature of Italian colonial claims and so long as it has not been demonstrated that a negotiation or an agreement on the basis of the agreement of 1935 is unattainable. I have, etc., (Sgd.) Eric Phipps.No. 192. (J 205/13/66). Secret. FOREIGN OFFICE, 3.7.1. 23rd January, 1939. Sir, With my despatch No.58 of the 7th January I forwarded to Your Excellency a copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Cairo, in v/hich Sir Miles Lampson expressed the hope that opportunity would be taken of the denunciation by Italy of the Franco-Italian Agreement of the 7th January, 1935, to prevent the Italian Government from obtaining possession of the Island of Dumeira at the southern end of the Red Sea. 2. This recommendation has been considered by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, who strongly support the proposal that opportunity should be taken of the denunciation by Italy of the Anglo-French Treaty of the 7th January, 1935, to persuade the French Government not to cede the island of Dumeira under any future arrangement which may be concluded with the Italian Government. I request that you will furnish me with your views as to the possibility of persuading the French Government in this sense. 3. In your despatch No.375_ (37/8/38) of the 30th March last you reported that the French sloop ”D*Iberville” visited the island of Dumeira on the 17th February last and that five separate parties and officers were landed and explored the island, but found no trace of fortification or of any human occupation whatsoever. The Lords /Commissioners His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir Eric Phipps, G.C.M.G., C.V.O., etc., etc., etc., ParisCommissioners of the Admiralty suggest that, as the French Government have so far refused to credit reports of the Italian occupation of this island, they might he urged to establish effective occupation thereof themselves, in view of the obvious danger of leaving it vacant. 4. I am not prepared to give any such direct advice to the French Government on so delicate a matter, for I realise that in the present state of affairs the effective occupation of this island might provoke Italian counter action, which might envenom still further the already inflamed relations between the two countries. On the other hand, subject to any views which Your Excellency may hold I authorise you to enquire of the French Government what their intentions are with regard to Dumeira, and to invite them to keep His Majesty’s Government informed of any action they may decide to take in regard to this island. I am, with great truth and respect, Sir, Your Excellency’s obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) (Sd.) V.

Accordingly, I boarded the ihip and was aatoniahed at the very cordial reception accorded to me. Commander Hodocanacchl received me moat waraly and enquired aomewhat feelingly regarding the welfare of ay wife and children. He said that the cordial reception given tothe TXftHK in ?**rGh 19B7 had been greatly appreciated ma that on coming to Kamaran they felt that a happy time was aeeared.

He promised to do »o and apologised moat profusely for the omission on this occasion. 7 . Commander * odocanacchi then expressed a desire to call officially.

The visit to ftOffHXYA waa regarded as a huge joke. The idea of visiting each a filthy hole was referred to in the neat derisive manner. The Cemender remarked that never In the whole of hie career had he seen ao aumy fliea. He was also Highly amieed at the order of the local Oovemor to the effect that only 5 men could be allowed ashore at one tlrae. He said he had never experienced such *a comic opera under official auspices.' vii. In conraon with the Officers of the T1GRE those of the PANT tiA expreasel themselves freely regarding conditions at ? assawa. ? *?Jnhealthy% 'unfit for human beings', ninaatisfactory as a base' and indeed, shortly, nothing but a 'hell hole'. such were the candid opinions expressed. Thus ended a good lunch somewhat marred by the most disgustingly dirty table cloth and napkins. The napkins had obviously been in use many times before. 9. Comander Hodocanacchl as red permission for hie men to land at Ksmaren* tinlike the TIOHK he aa^ed where the men ought to land and for some reason, particularly emphasised the fact that they were only to lend where J would direct then. I accorded permission to land at any of the piers most convenient to them and informed him that there were no restrictions cm the Island. I, however, made it clear that there were no prostitutes on the Island and that it was no use looking for them. I proffered this information, naturally, without any reference to the visit of the TIORX. Sailors were landed at 100 at s tine and, with one exception, their conduct ashore was exemplary* r ne party ehsaed a woman into her house and she, wisely, bolted the door. rtic or two of the men attempted to scale the wall but the arrival of the Civil Police prevented any disorder.

Women confined tbemaeivee to their houoea and two wedding ceremonies were cancelled. Shopkeepers had placed »tr&lt;mg tables across the ineide of their ahopa to atop any ruahing tactics. All these precaitions proved in thie case, fortunately, entirely unnecessary. Several r fflcere hunted gaeelle during the after noon of the 25th., but were uneuccceaful. X, therefore, organieed a *ehoot* for the following morning under the direction of the inspector, hetachraent Aden Armed Police. A party of h Italian Officers engaged a herd of 8 gaselle at very close vpiartera but failed to register. The Inspector took a hand and dropped a fine buck. Later, one of the officers got a decent buok with a good shot. Meanwhile, 7 conducted the Commandant# and several Officers over the Pilgrim Casspe and nialnfaction Plants. They showed considerable interest in the Quarantine Station arrangements and asked many questions including an important one as to the necessity of maintaining a uarantlne Station at Ka&amp;aran at all. 10.

There are 125,ooo people including the .Services, sick.and local population. The Conmandante remarked that theywere endeavouring to 'crowd-in * 125,000 where originally there were only 3,000 inhabitants. Buildings are being erected as rapidly as possible but auitable accommodation is far below normal requirements. ii. &lt;ne Officer was extremely bitter about the amenities of life in Italy, aasawa and Asmara. He said 'Nowadays we have to put up with bad food, rotten cigarettes and liberty is curtailed. Not like former day® when we had sll the good things of life. Hi. During conversation with the Commandants the flight of the Italian aircraft to Rio dc Janeiro waa mentioned. I remarked that X thought we had some *world-flier»* over Kaaaran recently because two unknown aircraft had passed over the Island flying in the direction of the Farean group of Islands. He became interested and I enquired whether any Italian machine® had been over here. He said he wan not aware if that was so but added carelessly *We have thousands of aeroplanes in Africa and Aaaab and one never knows where they might go.' ffQTK:- This refers to ths recent flight of foreign 1 sircraft ? believed to have been .tallan,/ which paaaed over Canaran, oheiya and 'i'^ Island (3audi) where oil drilling operations are in progress.!▼.

He reports (para.2) that the Crov/n Prince’s stock is rising and he is beginning to have very little doubt that this Prince will succeed his father in the first instance (though he is quite unfitted to rule). In para.6 he states that the King is fit enough but looks tired; that he is in full possession of his faculties and still attends to the minutest affairs of'State. Paras.8-11 deal with Italian activities in the Yemen. Captain Seager does not appear to have found much outward evidence of Italian 4136b 1000 10.35 intrigue/intrigue, and the Yemenis themselves appear to he singularly indifferent in the matter. In para.14 Captain Seager states that the King is rumoured to he endeavouring to introduce a system of conscription, and that in this connection he has engaged the services of one Hassan Tahsin Pasha, who claims to have heen the G.O.C. of the Hejazi troops in Saudi Arabia during the Saudi-Hejazi wars.

Extract from Report by Captain Seager, the Frontier Officer, dated 30th July, 1937. 8. I talian Activities in the Yemen . I have no fresh information to report regarding Italian activities in this country. Doctor E. Dubbiosi, the organising head of Italian activities in this country, returned from leave only three days ago. During his absence, Doctor Ferri, who left the country about a month ago, and Doctor Cicconi, an alleged high jumper of international repute some years ago, who was in private practice at Trinidad two years ago, acted for him. In this interim period they appear to have been content to act merely as paymasters to their agents in this country. It is unfortunate that I must leave San^ shortly as Doctor Dubbiosi has doubtless arrived with fresh instructions and it would have been interesting to observe whether any new form of renewed activities were envisaged. 9. Doctor Cicconi, who speaks English quite well, told Petrie that he anticipates trouble with Dubbiosi as the latter is a reserved taciturn creature strictly opposed to any form of social activity; and Cicconi is a man about town who likes his innocent little parties and recreations. 10. The Italian colony in the Yemen now numbers eleven souls. They are:- (a) Doctor E. Dubbiosi (b) Doctor Cicconi (c) Signor Kiccuci and wife Chief Italian doctor in the Yemen. Italian Surgeon - San’a. Clerk to Doctor Dubbiosi and undoubtedly his right hand man in political work. On Petrie’s authority I have it that he has nothing to do with the medical work. He lives in one of the most secluded parts in San*a in a house which would be an ideal centre for the visits of agents. He is a native of Florence where his/\ A J 2.

During my three weeks’ stay in the Yemen I heard no one hint at or mention the Italian bogey; and my contracts were comprehensive in the capital and on my way to and fro. I could explain the present atmosphere in this connection more clearly by saying that if an official unaware of the political situation in the Red Sea was to have visited San’a instead of myself and had been charged to report on the general political situation after a three weeks’ study, he would surely have heard nothing from officials, notables, merchants or tribesmen about the Italians, let alone their intentions unless he had asked them pointed questions. This has surprised me considerably and I have to confess that it is difficult to account for it. I could venture a theory that as the n Italian menace” to this country has not materialised following a two year period when such a contingency was the topic of the day, the Yemenis, with typical oriental casualness and inherent natural desire to let unpleasant things slide when these do not rear up and goggle at them, have subconsciously relegated the ’’menace” to the background. If something tangible under this head does take shape it will be the front page again, but why, in their way of thinking, should good time be wasted by kicking against the pricks when these pricks do not appear to prick. As I constantly emphasise the unexpected nature of/of things in this peculiar country I do not dare to push my theory any further. In any event it fits in v/ith the present atmosphere; and I venture to say as much as this with reserve. As it will be seen further on I have not yet had the opportunity of speaking to the Governor of Taiz who might raise the question of the Italians and their activities in this country. If he does so I will report separately in due course. 12. Though it is irrelevant here it is worthy of record to state that the Yemeni intelligentsia appear to be very interested in the Spanish war which they follow closely. They all fear that circumstances may arise there which will start a general war.% (tailS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT.) SECRET.

Foreign Office, S.W.l. 12th October, 1937. Sir, Conclusion (c) of the 51st Meeting of the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee held on the 8th June, was to the effect that the Foreign Office, in conjunction with the Admiralty and tha. Secretary of the Sub -Committee, should prepare a report, for submission to the Ministerial Sub -Committee, upon the question of drawing the attention of the Italian Government to the British Imperial interest in the Yemen, and the procedure by which this might be most effectively achieved. 2. A memorandum was accordingly prepared in the Foreign Office and was about to be sent to the Admiralty and the Secretary of the Sub-Committee for their observations when the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy called here and held the language recorded in the enclosure in Foreign Office letter S 3956/872/9i. of the 19th July. 3. In view of Signor Crolla’s remarks Mr. Secretary jiden considered it essential to clarify the uncertain situation either by obtaining more precise information as to the motives underlying these remarks and in particular as to the intentions of the Italian Government with regard to the extension or amplification of the Rome Understanding, or else by taking some early action of a nature to set at rest any doubt which the Italian Government might entertain as to the attitude of hisMajesty’s Government towards the Understanding. But the prospects of obtaining further light upon the motives of the Italian Government were small, since that Government were clearly uncertain as to their own future attitude and policy.- and appeared to he feeling their way with the object of ascertaining the reactions of His Majesty’s Government. 4. In these circumstances Mr. Eden decided to adopt the alternative course without delay and to state in the speech which he was about to make in the House of Commons on the 19th July, and in which he proposed to deal with Anglo-Italian relations in the Mediterranean, that the factors which affected that sea applied equally in the Red Sea. This he did in the following terms ’’This country has every intention of defending its national interests in the Mediterranean as elsewhere in the world. Yet it is important that there should be no misconception anywhere. While we are determined to defend our own interests, we have no intention of challenging those of others. This is why we made with Italy the Mediterranean agreement of last January. We stand by that agreement. If the Mediterranean is for us a main arterial road - and it is - yet there is plenty of room for all on such a road. If we intend to maintain our place upon it, and we do, we have no intention of seeking to turn anybody else ofi it. Least of all do we wish to interfere with those who geographically dwell upon it. There is ample room for all. Free traffic through and out of the Mediterranean is the common interest of Great Britain end of all the Mediterranean Powers.-3- \ ^4 ’’In t. e of certain reports t. at have reached me there is one further categorical assurance that I should like to give. This country has no intention of pursuing towards any other country a policy either of aggression or of revenge. Such a possibility has never even occurred to the British people. The word vendetta has no English equivalent. Jhe foreign policy of this country will never be based upon such a notive or influenced by such a sentiment. If any apprehensions exist upon that score they should be instantly allayed. To entertain them is truly to misconceive the British character, he wish to live in peace and friendship with our neighbours in the 1’editerranean, as elsewhere, for while we will defend our own, we covet nought of theirs. ’’The moment is perhaps opportune to add that what I have said about the mediterranean applies equally to the Red Sea. It has always been, and it is to-day, a major British interest that no Great Power should establish itself on the eastern shore of the Red Sea. I need hardly add that this applies to ourselves no less than to others”. I am, etc., (S igned) G.REiTDEL.

Ibn Saud’s remarks about his contempt of and, at the same time, fear of the Italians, seem to ring true, and we may probably be fairly confident that whatever happens Ibn Saud will be very careful not to break with H.M.G. if he can possibly avoid it. It is perhaps desirable to keep hold of this basic idea when considering H.M.G.’s relations with Ibn Saud, particularly in regard to Palestine. 4136b 1000 10.35 L0\ tiHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Sote by Sir R. Bullard respecting King Ibn Sand and the Italians. WHEN 1 was at Riyadh Ibn Saud seemed to be more concerned than ever about the Italians. He referred to M. Mussolini slightingly as the “Sword of Islam, but spoke with apprehension about his disposition to interfere in the affairs of other countries—now Abyssinia, now Spain or the Red Sea. He said that according to news from the Yemen the Italians were showing great activity in the Red Sea and had recently landed men on Hanish Island and its neighbour. I reminded the King of what Mr. Rendel had said to him about the Italians and the Red Sea during his visit to Jedda, but he was only half reassured. I promised to keep him informed of any Italian move in the Red Sea of which we might become aware. The King said that only two or three nights before, the Italian wireless had again referred to the close interest taken by M. Mussolini in Moslem affairs. He quoted with amusement the neat rebuke administered to M. Mussolini by the Agha Khan when M. Mussolini claimed to be the protector of Islam, but j said that in his opinion the Italian propaganda was dangerous. He heard about a year ago that the Grand Mufti of Palestine had accepted Italian help and imme diately asked the Mufti whether the story was true. The Mufti said that it was baseless, and that he would tell Ibn Saud the facts when he came on the pilgrimage. When he came to Mecca the Mufti assured Ibn Saud that he was not even in touch with the Italians; certain people who claimed themselves to be in touch with Italian circles had asked him why he did not accept Italian help, but he had refused to have anything to do with the Italians. As for himself, Ibn Saud did not even want to buy rifles from the Italians. The price at which the Italian rifles were offered had now been reduced to 10s. gold, but he had said that as the rifles he already had were of other makes he did not wish to buy Italian rifles as that would be confusing for his army. (Fuad told me on another occasion that the excuse was not strictly true, as they already had in fact a small number of Italian rifles.) Ibn Saud said that if he took anything from the Italians they would want something in return. In order to elicit his opinions I played devil’s advo cate. I said that His Majesty’s Government were offering a stock of arms at a low price; would they want something in exchange? No, said Ibn Saud; the interests of Saudi Arabia and Great Britain were identical. And would not the Italians allege that their interests were identical with his ? Ibn Saud indicated that he didn't care what the Italians said. When all was said, he declared, the British were the best people. They were better than the Italians, better than the Turks— better than the Arabs. He would even have preferred, from a purely Saudi point of view, that His Majesty’s Government should retain the mandate over Iraq. With the British as his neighbours he felt safe. As an Arab and a Moslem he must sympathise with the advance towards Arab independence, but the indepen dence of Iraq had created a situation which he viewed with grave anxiety. And now the British were going to give up their responsibility for Transjordan I EASTERN (Arabia). July 29, 1937. [E 4486/27/91] Section 1. Copy No. Foreign Office, July 29, 1937. R. W.

Sir, With reference to my Secret despatch of the 26th May 1937, on the subject of the extension of Italian influence on the Red Sea Littoral . nd in Aden protectorate territory, I have the honour to inform you thn.t about three weeks, ago persistent rumours were in circulation that an Italian warship had sent ashore agents in the bubeihi country, to the west of Aden, and that the &gt;e nau distributed arms and money to certain inhaoitants of that district. It was not possible to obtain ny definite or circumstantial reports regarding these incidents, but in view of the persistence of the rumours, it seemed desirable that investigations should be conducted as to their accuracy. 2. on the Idth of June therefore I sent the Second Political Officer, Captain the Honourable k.A.B. Hamilton, to the ubeihi country, and between that date and June the 25th he visited five different centres in the area concerned while a dhow acting dnder his orders visited perim and Bheikh Sa’id. 3. as a result of his investigation, Captain Ham.ilton has come to the conclusion that within the last two months the Italians have turned their attention to the deep anchorage that lies to the west of Ras al Ara on the coast between Aden ; nd Perim. he further thimea that they have established some sort of communication with the shore: there were repeatea references by the local Arabs to 'a white-painted steamer” which had approached the land, and to The Ri ,ht Honourable W.G.A* Onasby Gore, P.C., H.M.’s principi 1 secretary of State for the Colonies, Downing street, a.W.l.to a vessel ueacribeu as a submarine that had been seen on several occasions near the shore* explored, in submarines, the Has-al-Ara anchorage; and it is averred that during the last two months Italian vicinity and have lectured the people on the weaioiess of difficulty of establishing the truth or falsehood of such reports; for naturally, as soon as it is Known that investigations to that end are beln^ made, it is hard to find anyone who will admit to any kh owlecUe which might connect him with the subversive activities of a foreign power* But, ■ while I am satisfied that no '. un-running**, or distribution of money on a large scale has recently tu.*.en place within the Protectorate, I am nevertheless forced to the conclusion that Italian agent have, of late, been active in the iiubeihi country* the i rubian mainland adjacent to SheiKh &amp; id would be in keeping with the eusoected Italian design of securing coi of both coasty of the southern Red Sea, and of thereby g command of the Straits of Bab-el-Mandao, in the furtherance oi which project Italy is believed recently to have fortified Dumeira and Raheita on the African shore opposite perim. 7* At this stage I desire merely to acquaint you with the situation as it has presented itself t^o me, and to state that I am considering what steps should be taicen locally to counteract these activities. At present, I am examining the possibility of adopting two complementary measures: the 4.

'Norfolk* were intended in any way to deprive you of the use of tha t ship sliould you have oersonally considered it desirable. I was under the impression# however# that this suggestion emanated from the Commanding Officer of H.M.3. 'Norfolk'# as I was not of the same opinion as the latter# firstly as to the safety of a ship of that size in badly chartered waters# and secondly with regard to the effect on other countries# of the visit of an Q' Gun Cruiser to waters which would naturally be thought out of the ordinary *nd be apt to arouse cariosity and cause comment. On the other hand, the visit of a Sloop to euch waters would be a normal occurrence and likely to pass unnoticed. The 1 nding of Italians on various Islands in the Red 3eo has been constantly reported# ena with one exception only these reports h;&lt;ve proved entirely false. I do understand# however# that some Italians have been prospecting for oil in the d&amp;rafan and other Islands# an&lt;2 I Hie Excellency the Governor of Aden# rovemaient House# Aden.I have even heard it rumoured that they have asked permission to prospect in amaran Island and its vicinity. I am not, however, so seriously concerned about the above information, as I am of the fact that Italians have engaged a large number of Yemeni subjects during the last year for service in Kritrea as labourers, or possibly even, according to some reports, as soldiers. Apparently the Italians send these labourers back to Kodeida periodically,with ample sums of money, end engage others in their place. It is surely unreasonable to engage labourers for such short periods, if efficient labour is what the Italians require; on the other hand, if their intention is to influence the natives of the Yemen for other purposes, this is precisely the action needed, in any case the Italians appear to find plenty of money to pay them. The Political aspect of this matter is hardly within my province, but should my premise be correct, and the process of educational propaganda continue, I feel that under certain conditions an Italian Yemen would be easy to bring about. I have no doubt th, t in that case the balance might be rectified by the opposition of Saudi Arabia. four excellent Political Officers, with judicious agents, could doubtless ascertain the nature of the teachings given in Kritrea to these Yemeni labourers, with their reactions thereto, and I feel sure that such information would be of considerable value. These are matters which it is quite impossible for a sloop, or its officers, to dealwith and which I consider to be of prior importance to the possible occupation by the Italians of an Island from which they mi^ht be evicted. * The Red Sea Sloops have orders to keep in close touch with you, and I hope you will not hesitate to make such useenclosed) use of them as you may consider desirable with a view to elucidating the at? te of affairs* They are free to make out their own cruise programmes which are subject only to the concurrence of the Adair Ity and myself, and in peace time I see no reason why they should not be used as you may require* I attach for your information a copy of a Naval Appreciation of the Red : ea situation which I recently forwarded to the Admiralty* n view of its moat secret nature perhaps lour Excellency may consider it desirable to destroy it afte perusal* I much regret that I have so far not had the opportunity of meetiiio four Excellency as you were home on leave during all the time I was at Aden* I am looking forward however to hearing your views on the matters discussed in this letter* I have, etc. (Signed) A* Ramsay.

Blr, I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency’s secret and personal letter No. E*I*3464 dated 5th June 1937, and to than* you for the assistance that you offer in the use of Red jea oloops in dealing with the developments of the situation in southern Red 3ea and in the neighbourhood of den. There is no doubt th^t the Italian;; are endeavouring to forward their interests in the Yemen oy every means available short of direct and open intervention. Their propaganda work; in the Yemen, and especially in the coastal Tihama, is increasingly active, ana the frequent rumours of their occupation of islands in the Red bea are sign of the general apprehension that prevails. The engagement of Yemenis as labourers &lt;ind some times as soldiers, to which you refer, is one of the methods that they aopt to increase their influence. Unfortunately it is nmt within our power to stop it. The recruitment of Arabs from southern Arabia for Italian Colonial Force is a practice of long standing which commenced before the Great ar and has continued at intervals since that time. It has been increased since the autumn of 1935 owing firstly to the Abyssinian \/ar and more recently to the need for labour for carrying out the extensive works of uevelopment that Italy is undertaking at Massawa, , ssab and other places in her East frican possessions. The Italians offer ^ood wages Which appeal to the inhabitants of poor countries such as the Yemen His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies Station, Colombo.\ mum s ; Yeiaen end also the Aden Protectorate. Arabs coming bacic from Italian employment frequently bring stories of ill-treatment, but they are generally prepared to undergo this for t e sake of their financial gain# Incidentally a good deal of the money that theybrin^ with them ia smuggled, as the Italian authorities have forbidden the export of lire. 2. I do not thinx that the short periods for which the labou ers wotk are altogether the result of Italian design# It is custonuiry for such labourers to worK for a comparatively short ti.ie and to return to their families with the money earned, and in this respect the Italians allow them to follow their 1nclinations. The Yemen is an independent state, and it is not possible for us to prevent this labour recruitment, nor would it in any way add to British popularity in southern Arabia if we were to debar its people from taking advantage of an opportunity of mailing money* It is this desire to maxe money th t is the dominating motive with these people and although the Italians no doubt wish to extend their influence through them, the reports that they bring ere by no means Iw&amp;ys favourable. 3. We have recently had reports of the appearance of vessels, suspected of ueing Italian, off the coast immediately to the east of Perim and within the limits of the Aden Protectorate. It is thought th; t these ships uiay hove been sending munitions into the southern Yemen b this route. I have sent a Political Officer to the district to make furtner enquiries and H.M.S* 'Londonderry' intends to wa.eh this coast when she is in the neighbourhood. 4. I realise th; t sotie of the stories that reach us may be exaggerated or untrue, but I nevertheless feel that there is inereasirio evidence of Italian designs to obtaining control of both coasts of the southern Red gea and to establish themselves in Uie Yemen.

Anglo-Italian Relations in the Middle East. Signor orolla, the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy, called on me this morning and said that he had been instructed by the Italian Government to raise the question of our policy in Arabia as it might affect Italy. As I knew, and as he had told me on February 3rd last, the Italian Government attached the greatest importance to the maintenance of the Rome Understanding of 1927. But since the date of that Understanding there had been many developments. Italy, owing to her conquest of Abyssinia, occupied a more important position in the Red Sea area, and her interests were more deeply engaged and more widely extended there than they had been before. All that occurred in Arabia was thus of importance to her, and she had become, so to speak, much more ’’sensitive” in this area than in past. The Italian Government had therefore oeen disturbed by certain recent developments which suggested that His Majesty’s Government might be adopting a more forward policy. 2. Signor Crolla began by alluding to the recent arrival at Jedda of two British aircraft, apparently to bring documents to Sir R. Bullard, and to Sir R. Bullard’s immediately subsequent departure for Riyadh to interview Ibn Saud. He had a long complicated story about reports current in Jedda as to the objects of this visit, which had made/made the Italian Government very uneasy. Apparently realising that this was hardly a sufficient ground for the uneasiness v/hich he had been instructed to express to me, he went on to say - alleging, however, that he did so entirely on his own initiative - that he had read in the ;, Daily Herald'’ about a month ago that we were extending our authority and influence north of the Hadramaut, apparently with a view to establishing ourselves in the hinterland behind the Yemen. His explanations were confused and confusing, but he seemed anxious to suggest that His Majesty’s Government were now adopting a much more forward policy in Arabia, and that Italy, in view of her increased interest in East Africa, could not remain unaffected or indifferent. 3. I began by telling Signor Crolla that it seemed to me increasingly difficult to deal with these constant unjustified suspicions on the part of the Italian Government, in view of the background of hostility and suspicion which was being created by the perpetual attacks launched against everything we did by the Italian press. Hardly a day passed when I did not read in my telegrams of some new and utterly unjustified misrepresentation of our policy and motives in Italian newspapers. This was not my immediate concern, but it made it much more difficult to clear up local questions such as Anglo-Italian relations in Arabia and the Middle East, when one knew that whatever we said or did would be distorted and used against us in Rome. It t made one despair of ever getting anything properly straightened/\ A J straightened out. # 4. As regards Arabia, I could tell him at once categorically that we held firmly to the Rome Understanding of 1^27, and that we attached great importance to its integral maintenance. It was clearly laid down in that Understanding that it was a mutual and important interest both of Italy and of Great Britain that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. We had meticulously observed our own part of this Understanding, even to the extent of holding aloof in cases where we might have obtained a dominant position for ourselves in matters connected with Saudi Arabia. I hoped that the Italian Government would be equally scrupulous in keeping to their part of the Understanding, but I felt bound to say that the words and actions of certain Italians had done much to lend colour to the doubts which were felt in certain quarters here as to the ultimate intentions of Italy in regard to the Yemen. Our ov/n policy was, however, perfectly clear and simple. We desired to see the independent Arab States remain independent and strong. We had no desire whatever to extend our influence beyond those limited spheres in Arabia in which we were legally entitled to exercise it, and any rumours to the contrary were merely malicious inventions. 5. As regards the particular cases to which Signor Crolla had alluded, I could tell him quite frankly what had been the object of Sir R. Bullard’s journey. As Signor Crolla knew, we were faced with an extremely difficult problem in Palestine resulting from our conflicting obligations. The Royal/Royal Commission had now produced a Report and recommendations, which might well arouse strong feelings on both sides. We had felt it essential to ensure that the Commission’s Report and recommendations should be clearly understood by the leading personalities in the Arab world, and that there should be no risk of unnecessary misunderstanding owing to incomplete or inaccurate information. We had therefore decided to send Sir R, Bullard to Riyadh to explain the Report and recommendations of the Commission and the conclusions of His Majesty’s Government thereon frankly and accurately to King Ibn Saud the day before those documents were published in this country. This had involved Sir R, Bullard reaching Riyadh with the Report and conclusions of His Majesty’s Government not later than July 6th, and, seeing that the Report had not been in our hands until the evening of June 22nd, it had not been physically possible to arrange this without sending the necessary documents to him by air. I had myself been responsible for the proposal to send the two aircraft to Jedda, and had only hit upon this way of sending the papers to Sir R, Bullard after I had found that all the other methods of communication would have been too slow. It was quite possible that Sir R.Bullard might take the opportunity of his visit to Riyadh to discuss any other outstanding matters with the King, but the object of his journey was perfectly simple and straightforward, and it was absurd to read deep ulterior political motives into it, or to represent it as implying any change of policy on our part.\ 6. As regards what Signor Crolla had said about our adopting a forward policy in the hinterland of the Hadramaut and extending our authority round to the 'back of the Yemen, this was equally off the rails. There had 'been no question whatever of our extending our authority in this area. The 'boundaries of the Aden Protectorate dated from 'before the war, and from the days of the Anglo- Turkish Conventions about Aden of 1905 and 1914. This applied also to the Arab States under British protection on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, to which Signor Crolla had made an allusion. The legal boundaries of our sphere of influence both in the case of the Aden Protectorate and in that of our Arab protected States on the Persian Gulf were laid down in the two Anglo-Turkish Conventions of July 29th, 1913 and March 9th, 1914, and the relevant article was Article 3 of the latter Convention, which laid down the so-called blue and violet lines. This Convention had been published in Volume XI of Aitchison’s Treaties (l933 Edition, Volume XI, page 42). The legal position was still governed by it, and as regards the north-west frontier of the Aden Protectorate, the frontier had been confirmed by the Anglo-Yemeni Treaty of 1934 (Gmd 4630), Article 3 of which provided for the maintenance of the existing frontier. There had never been any question whatever of our extending our influence beyond this line, and the last thing we should contemplate doing was to penetrate beyond it and adopt a forward territorial policy in spheres in respect of which we had no legal claim. As regards the Aden Protectorate, which legally extended up to the/V the '’violet line” to the north-west, and up to a line running inland from i^as Dharbat Ali on the east where it marched with the dultanate of Muscat and Oman, our treaties with the various chiefs and leaders in the northern and eastern areas corresponded exactly to our treaties with the various chiefs and leaders in the south western district. There was no difference between one part of the Aden Protectorate and another except that we had not in the past exercised any active control over the northern and eastern areas because there was no immediate reason to do so and they were difficult to get at. But now that the hinterland of Pejran etc. was being opened up and the influence of neighbouring Arab States was making itself felt, it was obviously necessary that we should ourselves establish our own authority within our own legal area. This did not imply any change of policy or any new departure. it was merely an internal measure within a sphere for which we were internationally legally responsive. T. Signor C roll a asked whether v/e were not negotiating with Ibn Saud over the northern sphere. He alluded to reports of my having carried on negotiations myself with the King on this subject when I visited Arabia last March. I replied that there was no particular secret about the fact that discussions had been going on with King Ibn Saud for some time about a possible revision of the blue line frontier. Although this was the legal frontier, it had been fixed at a time when the country was little known, and there were now indications that some of the tribes who wandered/V V&gt; . 1 '. 4756 1£37_J; wandered to the east of the blue line did in fact come under Ibn Saud’s authority. The area was one of little importance and consisted almost wholly of uninhabited desert. We were therefore not inclined to insist too strongly on the legal line, and conversations had been proceeding in a desultory way with a view to some new line being agreed on. They were for the time being more or less in abeyance, and, as far as we ourselves were concerned, the area which was of most importance to us was the coastal belt. But, however this might be, the fact remained that legally the whole area to the east and south east of the blue and violet lines fell within our sphere of influence, and was internationally under our protection, with the exception of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, which was an independent State. Our actions in this area therefore could not possibly be regarded as involving any new policy or any departure from the spirit of the Rome Agreement. 8. I told Signor Crolla that I had given him this full and frank explanation, as I wished to clear up any risk of misunderstanding and to try to convince him that our policy had not changed, and that we still held firmly to the principle of the Rome Understanding that no European Power should establish itself in independent Arabian territory. But I felt bound to add that the Rome Understanding really seemed hardly applicable to this area, since that Understanding specifically referred to the Red Sea and to the Arabian Red Sea coast. The areas under our protection to the south-east and east of the violet and blue line s/lines, which had nothing whatever to do. with the Red Sea, therefore hardly seemed to come into the picture. 9. Signor Crolla replied that the Italian Government felt that the Rome Understanding of 1927 ought not to he applied in too narrow or local a spirit. In their view, it was important that there should he a clear understanding about British and Italian interests to cover the whole of Arabia and the Middle East. I asked Signor Crolla whether he meant by this - as he had at one moment seemed to imply - that the Italian Government wanted the Rome Understanding extended or amplified. I was unable to get a definite reply from him to this question, but he continued to say that it ought to be interpreted in the widest possible spirit. 10. Signor Crolla was not easy to follow, as he wrapped his ideas up in complicated language with a mass of allusions and implications, from which he showed great agility in retreating whenever I tried to hold him down on any particular point. My first impression was that he was trying to represent that we had violated the Rome Understanding and that Italy might therefore regard herself as free to adopt a forv/ard policy. He did indeed at one moment hint at something of the kind. When he realised, however, how strong our case was for saying that we had scrupulously observed the Rome Understanding ourselves, he rather changed his ground and began, somewhat petulantly, to insist on how unjustified our suspicions were of Italian designs on the Yemen; he had assured me over and over again, and particularly on February/February 3rd, in the most categorical terms that Italy had no intention whatever of adopting a forward policy in the Yemen or of violating the Rome Understanding. It seemed to him that, if it was a question of unjustified suspicions, our suspicions of Italy were more unjustified and seemed harder to allay than the suspicions which the Italians had entertained against us. I did not pursue this subject further, beyond making it clear that the Italians themselves had done much to shake our own confidence in them. The interview was, however, entirely friendly. 11. At more than one stage in the discussion I made it quite clear that His Majesty’s Government still attached very serious importance indeed to the principle enshrined in the Rome Understanding that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. But in the absence of a final decision of the question whether some public statement should be made on this point - a question which is still under consideration - I avoided making any new statement about it which could commit us further than we are committed already.

I am to observe that the despatch was not received in time for circulation at that meeting. 3. Similar letters are being sent to the Foreign Office, Admiralty, War Office and Air Ministry. I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant, £££?, r n &gt;. DEPf: | [18 JUN1937 I India c . - - L*-t THE UNDER SECRETARY OP STATE, fcf.CUWURE IN WEEKLY LETTtR , 2 5 24JUN1957 &gt; i ^ffiTARY, POLITKML AND ^PT. INDIA OFFICE ■.j- * INDIA OFFICE\ r=\ V QOVKRNOH’S O^TICKf Aden* 26th May# 1937* Sir# I have the honour to refer to your secret deep uteri of 26th November 1936 and to my telegraphic reply of 10th December 1936 regarding Italian activities in the Yemen, and to state that in view of further developments in that country I consider it desirable to summarise again the position as far as I am aware of it at the present time* 2. The unsatisfactory internal situation in the Yemen is due to three principal factors# v^hich are# firstly# doubt and anxiety regarding the succession to the Imam’s throne# secondly, the discontent of the Dhafa’i population of the Tihama with 2*eidi rule and thirdly# the prevalent Deliel that Italy is actively fishing in these troubled waters and intends to intervene as soon as a suitable opportunity offers. 3. As I have pr viously reported to you# the old King has long desired to ensure the succession of his eldest son, Seif al Islam Ahmed# and with this object he arranged some years ago for his election as heir. The weakness of this arrangement lies in the possibility that the valiuity of the election will be contested and in the personal unpopularity of Ahmed# who is reputed to be a cruel# bigoted and vicious tyrant. Until recently# however, it has been generally anticipated that Ahmed would succeed on the death of the present King and that rival claimants to the throne would postpone any active move against him until his oppressive rule produced sufficient discontent to give them a favourable opportunity. Lately a belief has been growing up that under the The Right Honourable . 0. A. Ormsby Uore# P.C.# Secretary of State for the Colonies# Londonthe influence of Italian intrigue the crisis may be accelerated and may even be brought about before King Yahya's death. 4 * I’be possible rival claimants to the throne may be divided into two groups. In the first place there are Seif al Islam Ahmed's brothers. The Imam has eleven sons livingt and of these the milder husein or tlie pleasure loving 'Ali would be more welcome to many people# both Zeidis and sheila is# uhan Ahmed. secondly# there are members of the powerful Al azir family, of whom the most prominent are iSeiyid Abdullah al Wazir (Governor of Hodeida)# aeyid 'Ali al /azir (officer Commanding at Taiz) and heyid Muhammad al vazir (Governor of Dhamar). This family is a collateral branch of the ruling house and its members are therefore eligible for election to the Imamate# although Seiyid *Ali al Vazir is# or should be# disqualified by his physical defect of blindness in one eye. The whole Wazir family between them control the tiost important b'hafa'i districts in the Tihama and in the southern Yemen adjacent to the Aden Protectorate border. They are alleged to be in close contact with the Italians# whose influence is strong at Hodeida and Taiz. Seiyid Abdullah al Wazir would probably make a strong ruler and would not willingly subject the Yemen vj foreign control# but circumstances may prove too powerful for him. Seiyid 'All al wazir is alleged to have no eucii scruples and to be willing to accept foreign protection in oraer to serve his own ends. 5 * The discontent of the Shafa'is with Zeidi rule is ol long standing, and in the past they have taken every opportunity to escape from it. They did so in the eighteenth century# when the independence of a part of the Tihama was maintained for some time by the Sheikhs of Abu Arish. Later on in the nineteenth century the Bhafa'is welcomed the presence of the Turks, vho protected them againstagainst the Zeidis, and when Turkish power in the Yemen came to an end in 191d» the shaTa’is would have accepted British control, and many of those in the southern Yemen anticipated that the Aden protectorate woula be extended to include them, and some of their representatives came to Aden to make their submission. British policy at that time wavered between the Imam in the interior and the Idrisi on the coast, but it was eventually decided to sacrifice the Idrisi and to aim at an understanding with the Imam. The dislike of the Bhafa'is to Zeidi government was exemplified when they held up Colonel Jacob’s Mission on its way to ban 1 a in 1919 in order to prevent the conclusion of an agreement which they rightly suspected would have the effect of placing them under the Imam, when they eventually released the Mission they endeavoured to make a condition that they should be taken under British protection in order to keep the Zeidis out of their country. Great Britain rejected this op &gt;ortunity of obtaining control of the Yemen coast, and in the eyes of the discontented Shafa'is the Italians have now taken the place of the British as the foreigners to whom they may look for help. Evidence is accumulating that Italy is exploitin, this position to the utmost, but Italian policy may be reluctant to antagonise the Zeidis completely, and would probably prefer to establish a prd-Italian successor to the Imam governing the entire Yemen to promoting a separate Shafa’i State in the Tihama under Italian protection. Nevertheless, it appears that the Italians are endeavouring to prepare the way for an ostensibly spontaneous appeal by the Shafa’is for their intervention, and the situation is such that I submit that it requires the most careful attention of His Majesty^ Government to prevent the establishment of Italian control on both sides of the Red Bea. I't has hitherto been the polic of His Majesty’s Government to favour the continued independence and^ ^ ^ ^ integrityintegrity of the ^emen Kingdom, and the Frontier Officer at Aden and I have made no response to tentative and secret overtures made to us from time to time hy seiyid ’All al Wazir of Taiz* While maintaining friendly personal relations with the members of tile Al Wazir family, British officials have been careful to give them no encouragement in their intrigues against the Central Government at Gan 1 a. If civil war breads out in the Yemen the heads of the Al Wazir family may, however, become de facto rulers of Hodeida and of districts adjoining the Aden protectorate and in that case it would be important, while maintaining our neutrality in the civil war, to come to some wonting understanding with them in order to prevent as far as possible the intrusion of other foreign influence. The outcome of the present situation in the Yemen i$ difficult to foretell. King Yahya’s death has often been predicted, but in spite of his chronic Kidney trouble he is a strong old man and may well survive for several more years. He has so far observed the Treaty of San*a faithfully and as lon^ as he remains in power the Government of Yemen may be expected to maintain its friendly official relations with Great Britain, although it will continue to discourage British as well as other foreign enterprise in the country. It is quite possible that Seif al Islam Ahmed may succeed in establishing himself as the next King. With all his faults, he is believed to be a etron^ and determined man. He is a soldier, and he shares his father’s wish to keep all foreigners at bay. It is therefore unlikely that he would willingly become a puppet in Italian hands. In my opinion the success of his rivals would be very doubtful unless they are ^iven foreign assistance, but active Italian aid would probably turn the scale in their favour. Italian prestige has been increased by Italy’s easy auccess in Ethiopia and more especially by her defiance of the League ofof Nations, which was oniversally regarded hy Arabs as acting under the leadership of Great Britain. The failure of the latter to save Ethiopia and her apparent indifference to the fate of the Yemen facilitate the work of the Italian propagandists. 9. Many of the reports emanating from the Yemen continue to be contradictory and confusing, and when the Frontier officer, Oaptain seager, returns to Aden next month I propose to send him to dan’s through Taiz and Hodeida in order to obtain authoritative information on the latest developments. There are several outst.oiuing questions of more or less importance which can furnish the ostensible reason for his visit at this time. His re jort will be communicated to you as soon as possible. Meanwhile I submit that the policy of His Majesty’s Government in the event of direct or indirect Italian intervention in the affairs of the Yemen needs very careful oonsider'ition. This is probably being given to it already, and I trust that steps are being taken to safeguard British interests in this area. I shall be grateful if a communication of the views of His Majesty’s Government on thi^- subject can be given to me, more especially with regard to the attitude that local British representatives should adopt if they are approached by the contending parties in the Yeracne I have, etc. (Signed) B.

C # Memorandum (E.2816/872/91) on the iubject prepared by the Foreign Office. (Paper No. MoE.(O) 226), THE CHAIRMAN referred to the previous discussion on this question at the 48th Meeting of the Sub-Committee on the 14th December last in which a recommendation, subject to the views of the Chiefs of Staff, was made regarding the policy to be adopted by His Majesty’s Government. Those viev/s had no 1 - been received, and confirmed the Sub committee's opinion regarding the importance of the Yemen. He suggested that their Paper should be noted. MR. RENDEL said that he had little to add to the Foreign Office memorandum of the 2nd June which summarised the position in regard to the Yemen. All sources of information confirmed the view that the situation there was very unstable. There was a great deal of internal intrigue going on and civil war might well break out before the Imam died. If Ibn Saud had been inclined to move against the Yemen there was little doubt that he might have found some party there to help him, but there was no indication that he was prepared to do so, if only lest such a move should bring him into conflict with the Italians On the whole Ibn Saud seemed more likely to continue the policy which he had adopted after the Saudi-Yemen war, when he refrained from any attempt to establish himself in the Yemen*- 3 - There was certainly a gr^at deal of Italian intrigue going on. He drew attention to certain recent reports v-hich had already been circulated to all the Departments represented on the Committee* which were of a definitely alarmist nature. &lt; These were supplemented by a great number of indications of increasing Italian activity in the Yemen* which might easily produce a most dangerous situation. Sir Miles Lampson in Cairo considered the Italain danger a grave and imminent one. On the other hand* it was naturally easier from Cairo to see Italian intrigues in their local aspect than in relation to Italian policy as a whole. Prom the latter point of view, there had recently been indications that the Italians were anxious xor their own reasons to keep the Rome Understanding alive, and that they were more nervous of the consequences which might follow if it were allowed to lapse, and His Majesty’s Government were to be thereby released from their obligations under it, than anxious to take the initiative in violating it themselves. The Italian Government had twice within the last two months sought assurances that His Majesty’s Government were not contemplating a forward policy in Arabia, and that they still held to the policy of the Rome Agreement. This suggested that the Italians might still be anxious to observe the Rome Agreement, not from any desire to observe their obligations as such, but because they might think it to their own interest to do so. It thus seemed an open question whether the Italians would adopt a forward policy in the Yemen or continue to observe the Rome Agreement. If His Majesty’s Government were now to take some definite action, e.g. by a public statement in the form of an answer to a Parliamentary Question, it might be that this would just tip the scale- 4 - . V 7 and deter the Italians from an adventure. On the other hand, it was most difficult to foretell how the Italians would react to any move. V/hile a clear statement might act as a deterrent, it might equally provoke some new outburst of hysteria. Moreover, assuming that the Italian danger was serious, and that a public declaration was the best way of meeting it, it was essential to know how far we should be prepared to implement such a declaration in case of necessity. It would be fatal to attempt a bluff. The Italians had already called our bluff once, and we could not risk their calling it again. The first point for consideration seemed to be whether, if we made a declaration, we should be prepared to see it through. THE CHAIRMAN observed that we had already gone a long way towards committing ourselves to the policy of keeping the Italians out, if only by what had recently been said to King Ibn Saud. MR. RENDEL said that we had only repeated to King Ibn Saud the formula already used in the Rome bnderstanding. There was therefore no new commitment. On the other hand, it would be much more difficult to with •raw from a public statemsnt than from what had already been said. The Italians would appreciate this point, and would realise that vie could not go back on a public statement v/ithout very serious loss of prestige, while they might assume that we should be readier to hedge if the Rome Understanding v/ere left unsupplemented by taking the line, for example, that circumstances had changed since it had been concluded, or that it was for some other reason no longer entirely applicable. The probable reaction of the Italians was really the dominating factor in considering what action should be taken, but on the whole he thought that the balance of advantage lay in favour of a public statement, provided it could be so drafted as to forestall\ ^ (V) any Italian reaction on tie grounds that it was gratuitously provocative 9 O’MLLEY said that, as was clear from his remarks to the Dominion representatives at the Imperial Conference, the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs was not at all happy about the formula adopted by the Committee of Imperial Defence in regard to Italy, i.e. an unreliable friend but not a probable enemy. In the near future a Paoer would be submitted to the Comittee of Imperial Defence in which the Foreign Office emphasised their view that Italy should for the time being be regarded not necessarily as our most formidaole potential adversary, but as the country most likely to involve us in hostilities, and. most lively to take advantage of any opportunity that might be presented ,oy our being in difficulties elsewhere. Our vital interests interlock with Italian aspirations far more than with those of O-ermany. Regarded in this general perspective the position in the Yemen became more ominous. It was no good imagining that any valid assurances could be obtained from Ital'. She was purely opportunist and would go at any time as far as she thought she could with saxet5^ in total, disregard of any previous undertakings. The only hope for the observance by Italy of the Rome undertaxing of 19^'7 la,, in the fact that she might think the consequences of releasing us from it would be to her own disadvantage. He recognised that the new formula in regard to Italy might call for serious modifications in our general strategical policy and would be a matter of much concern to the Defence Services. The cues\ion would have to be considered of our ability to stand up to Italy ■orocedure in an Anglo-Italian war. —o- and ourCAPTAIN PHILLIPS observed that plans for an Anglo-Italian war would shortly be coming before the Planning Committee and would reveal a deficiency of material much of which was also required for the defence of this country. MR. 0*MALLICY said that personally he was in favour of some public statement on the Yemen question although the Secretary of State had left the matter open for discussion. He thought it would be as well not to leave Italy under any misapprehension. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS said that the Admiralty thought that a public statement would be open to grave objection on the grounds of the publicity that it must inevitably attract. He understood the Rome Agreement had never been made public but it was now suggested that a public statement on the same subject should be made. Caning out of the blue he thought this was bound to lead to considerable criticism. It would be very unfortunate if the Press in either country made a sensation of it and it led to further trouble with Italy. The statement would, of course, contain nothing that was not known quite well to both Governments, and looked at from this angle there seemed no particular reason for saying anything to the Italian Government publicly or privately. On the other hand he thought it might be advisable to disabuse the Italian mind about any possible weakening in our attitude towards the Yemen. If it were considered necessary to take some action he suggested that the best method would be a straight-forward private approach through the diplomatic channels to the Italian Government. The best way to get a patient to take nasty medicine was to give it to him in private. An opening was provided by the interview between Mr. Rendel and Signor Crolla on the 3rd February last.and Signor Crolla on the 3rd February last HR. CLAU30N said he thought the Admiralty view had a good deal to commend it, and if the approach were made direct it would be more likely to have the desired effecto MR. RENDER said that it was rather misleading to describe the Rome Understanding as a secret one. He gave a brief account of the circumstances which had led to its conclusion, but it had been at the time an entirely informal agreement, and, as far as he knew, the question of its publication had never arisen. It was in fact in the nature of diplomatic talks and correspondence, and no doubt there had seemed at the time no more reason for publishing it than for publishing any other part of the correspondence passing between His Majesty’s Embassy and the Italian Government• THE CHAIRMAN thought that, whatever the precise nature of the arrangements had been if it were published now Parliament would regard it as an agreement which nad been of a secret nature, and take exception to its not having been published at the., time it was made. MR. RENDER questioned whether a private statement to the Italians now, warning them that His Majesty’s Government regarded it as a vital British imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself in the Yemen, would add anything to the Rome Understanding. The Italians would wonder why His Majesty’s Government made the statement, and they would also almost certainly use it as an opportunity for seeking to reopen the whole subject, and start new discussions regarding Anglo-Italian interests in—8— the Middle East. v It woula he unlikely that we snould gain anything by such a uiscussion, ana we .night then fall between two stools. The Italian attitude was likely to be that a commitment entered into privately coulu be abanaoned without loss of face, out they woula appreciate that it would be far more difficult for His hajesty’s Government to go oack on any kind of public statement. GROUP CAPTAIN PIRIE said that the Air Ministry did not go quite as far as the Admiralty but felt there were objections to the procedure oy Parliamentary question and answer. He thought Signor Crolla’s approaches provided a basis foi mentioning the subject to Italy out it would be unwise to be too specific in advance of a decision as to our ability ana willingness to implement any commitment if it should become necessary* LT.-COLONEL OSBORNE agreed. There was clearly a difference between our ability to unaertake immediate action ana our ability to undertake action later when we were better equipped. MR. R3KDEL, answering a question by Mr. Cowell, said that the interests in the Rome Unaerstanding were mutual. The Italians always expected other people to act as they would act themselves, and the iaea that v/e should refrain from attempting to do something which was in our own interest merely because we had proaiised not to do so would never occur to them. They no doubt imagined that we were continually on the look out fox j an opportunity to embark on a more forward policy in Arabia, although as a matter of fact our actual policy was to keep the situation as static as possible.It was obvious to the Italians that His Majesty’s Government would stand to gain certain definite advantages by violating the Rome Understanding, For example, Kamaran, v/hich we already administered, would make an excellent naval base, and the Italians no doubt realised that it would suit the British Admiralty very well to annex it* In the same way, the Farsan Islands would offer a most convenient landing ground for the Royal Air Force,and the Italians no doubt appreciated that the Air Ministry would welcome the opportunity of being able to use them freely* Finally, it was obvious that Ibn Saud would welcome some kind of British alliance, and the Italians no doubt imagined that we should be very ready to establish a privileged position for ourselves in Saudi Arabia* The Italians probably felt that we were only deterred from doing all this by the fear that, if we thus violated our obligations under the Rome Under standing, they would equally violate theirs, and establish themselves in the Yemen* They therefore had a definite motive of self-interest in keeping their own side of the bargain in the hope of thereby inducing us to keep ours* They certainly had no higher motive than this, but it might quite conceivably prove an effective one*MR. HaLE said that the Treasury were not deeply concerned in this matter hut they supported the Admiralty view generally. He observed that we were frequently reminded that Mussolini was a journalist. He therefore probably attached more importance to what appeared in the Press than most rulers did. This was a good reason for avoiding undue publicity. But was it necessary to take any action? Was there any reason to suppose that anything we could say to Italy now would affect their view of their own interests at some future date? Were there any grounds for thinking that Italy really underrated our interest in the Yemen? THE CHAIRMAN said the Foreign Office representative appeared to be In favour of some public statement, whereas other members of the Sub-Committee were opposed to that course. But in any event as he saw it the Sub-Committee were dealing with a subject v/hich might have far reaching and serious reactions, and ho thought that it would be ed/is able at this stage to make a report to the Ministerial Sub-Committee. MR. O'MALLEY said that the publication now of something which looked like an International Agreement might involve the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in a somewhat embarrassing explanation. THE CHAIRMAN observed that this supported the Admiralty view. MR. RENDEL said that if any public statement was made, it could be drafted so as to repeat the vital phrase in an unmistakable way without any reference to the Rome Agreement. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS said that if it were possible to refer back to the 192? Agreement, his objections would be largely met, but he did not think this could be done, and a public statement now would therefore be regarded by the Italian public as some thing entirely new. If this lead to an unfortunate reaction,it could only be defended by publishing the Rome Agreement. - 10 -a, D \ MR. O’MALLLY said that the nature and effect of a confidential approach to the Italian Government would he fundamentally different from that of a public statement. It would or might he regarded and treated as an invitation to enter into negotiations, hut it was difficult to believe that in view of the inefficacy of the Declaration of 2nd January, fresh negotiations would have fruitful and enduring results. What, as he understood it, they were discussing were the merits of a warning and not of a negotiation. In the second place a warning made confidentially was not a thing which in his view Italy would take very seriously. A public v/arning was quite a different thing - a thing which would probably elicit a good deal of public support in this country and from which it would be clear to the Italians that we could not lightly recede. For these reasons he saw little advantage, in present conditions, in a confidential approach to the Italian Government. MR. RENDER agreedo He said that there appeared to be three possible courses - (l) a public statement, (2) a private approach which might lead to negotiations for a new Agreement, and (3) no action® Captain PHILLIPS said that although his first reaction when he read the Foreign Office paper was in favour of taking no action, he was now disposed to think that it would be an advantage to make a fresh statement privately to the Italians, having regard to the misleading inferences which the Italians might draw as a result of the Abyssinian affair. The Rome Agreement was 10 years old, and an opening had been given by the Italians for a reference to it. He thought it was unduly pessimistic, even in 1937, to assume that a private statement by the British Government, regarding a matter in which it said it had a vital interest, would carry no weight with the Italian Government. He would -ll-be sorry to think that this represented a correct view and he did not agree with it. He thought that the suggested statement to he made privately to the Italian Government might take the form of pointing out that conditions in the Yemen were radically different from those in Abyssinia* In the latter place we had no particular interest, hut in the former we had a vital strategical interest* The Yemen was not in the League of Nations, and this would not he a League matter hut a clear issue between the two Governments* He thought the wording in the Rome Agreement could not he improvedr MR. SEAL pointed out that Italian intrigue in the Yemen was a new factor which ought not to he ignored. MR. RENDEL observed that the intrigue was not new, hut the field had become more fertile* MR. SEAL thought that the intensification of the intrigue was certainly a new factor. He added, in favour of a private approach rather than a public statement, that in the event of Italy going into the Yemen when we were involved in difficulties elsewhere, e.g. in a war with Japan, it might not he possible for us to take steps turn the Italians out at once, although it would he necessary and possible for us to do so at some later stage on the assumption that we were victorious. In such circumstances our temporary loss of prestige might he greater if a public statement had been made*(a) To take note of Paper NOo CoOoS* 563, 'being a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the strategic importance of the Temenc (h) To endorse the recommendation contained in conclusion (c) of Item 1 of the Minutes of the 48th Meeting of the Sub-Committee.

I am, etc., (8 i gned) G-. W. REED EL. Whit eha11 Gardens, S. W. 1 i-th June, 1937.7 (E 2816/872/91) The Yemen. (A ) Elements in the present situation, I, Internal, The internal situation in the Yemen is disquieting. For some years accounts of the unpopularity of the King have 'been reaching us with increasing frequency. These accounts have “been circulated to the various Departments of His Majesty's Government concerned, and need not “be further summarised here. But it is perhaps worth drawing attention to the extreme anxiety expressed on this subject hy King Ihn Saud in the series of conversations which he had with Sir Reader Bullard and Mr. Rendel in Jedda at the end of March (see record enclosed in Sir Reader Bullard’s despatch Eo,41 of the 23rd March - already circulated ; * Mro Hope Gill of His Majesty’s Consular Service, who recently accompanied Captain Seager, the Aden Frontier Officer, on his last visit to Sana’a, was much struck “by the dangers of the internal situation, to which Captain Seager himself had already more than once drawn attention. Reports from a variety of sources all tend to confirm the impression that the situation is dangerous, 2, Briefly it seems clear that the King of the Yemen is Becoming increasingly unpopular, that his chief Minister, Raghih Bey, is generally Believed to Be in the pay of the Italians, that Seif el-Islam Ahmed, the heir apparent, is much disliked and that it is douBtful whether he will ever Be allowed to succeed his father, and that the country as a whole is much divided and likely to fall into rebellion or civil war on very slight provocation. The Shafai/the/ The Shafai elements of the coastal plain are in particular hostile to the Zeidi elements in the mountains, while among the latter the Wazir family, although Zeidis, seem to he increasingly hostile to the present regime and to he actively intriguing against it, II* External # This situation appears to offer a fruitful field for Italian intrigue# For many years the Italians have had their eye on this corner of Arabia, partly because they have regarded it as one of the few parts of the world which was not already under the influence of some other Power, and partly because of the obvious strategic and commercial advantages which they could secure by its occupation. Italian intrigues with a view to the establishment of Italian influence have been actively proceeding for many years, chiefly through the agency of Italian medical missions# There is no reason to believe that these intrigues have hitherto proved very successful, since the Italians appear to be unpopular and generally regarded with much suspicion. On the other hand the unexpected and overwhelming success in Abyssinia has /* undoubtedly made the Italians feared and to some extent respected, and the danger «f their su r cessful penetration in the Yemen has thereby been much increased. 4.# as against this it should be noted that, by the Roma Understanding of 1927, the Italians formally recognised that it was a vital British interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian coa*^ of the Red Sea. The Understanding amounted in fact to a mutual self-denying ordinance on the part of the Italian Government and His Majesty’s Government by whichthe/ the two Governments virtually undertook to refrain from any forward policy in this area* Y/hile it is of course obvious that the Italians in their present frame of mind would not be deterred from establishing themselves in the Yemen by any mere treaty engagements or other promises to tne contrary, there is reason to believe that they are no less nervous lest His Majesty’s Government should themselve adopt a forward policy in Saudi Arabia than His Majesty’s Government are nervous of Italian ambitions in the Yemen, It may be therefore that the Italians will observe the letter of their undertaking if only in the hope of ensuring that His Majesty’s Government observe the letter of theirs. nevertheless, there is every reason to believe that Italian colonial, military and naval local authorities, as distinct from the central government, are inclined to pursue a much more forward policy in this area, and the possibility cannot be excluded that these authorities might provoke an incident leading to some form of Italian intervention, which Rome might be either unable or unwilling to control or to repudiate. 5. It is extremely difficult to decide in advance what particular action on the part of the Italians should be regarded as a definite attempt cm the part of Italy to establish’ herself (in the words c r 'ine Rome Understanding^ on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea”. Such an attempt might in the first place merely take the form of causing local trouble in the hope of deriving some advantage, or pegging out some claim, in the resu .tant confusion. Should civil war break out in the Yemen it is possible that Italy might go a stage further and intervene in the conflict in much the same way as she has intervened in Spain. Asthe Spanish conflict has proved, it may he extremely difficult to establish the precise extent of such intervention, and there is the further danger that even a very small degree of intervention might produce an incident which Italy could not ignore and which would lead to action on her part, which it might be difficult for His Majesty’s Government effectively to challenge - e.g. an ostensibly temporary occupation or some strategic point. Italian action might also take the form of direct intervention of a military character leading to the % establishment of Italian influence in a way which would unquestionably fall within the terms of the Rome Understanding, 6, It would be of doubtful utility to speculate on all these possible hypotheses, since the precise extent to which some of them could be regarded as an attempt on the part of Italy to ’establish herself on the Arabian coast ''of the Red Sea' would necessarily depend on the circumstances existing at the time. Possibly, the safest course will be to follow as closely as possible, in any new declaration (see e.g. paragraph 10 below) which may be made by His Majesty’s Government on the subject, the terms ol the Rome Understanding itself, thus introducing no new element, into the situation, but leaving His Majesty’s Government complete freedom to interpret their declaration as circumstances may render desirable. 7. Finally there is the question of the strategic importance of the Yemen from the point of view of imperial communications, etc. This aspect oi the matter is fully dealt with in the memorandum of the 19th February by the Chiefs of-Staff Sub-Committee, which has already been circulated/circulated to the various Government Departments concerned (B) Su^^ested Action * 8. It seems clear from the foregoing that His Majesty’s Government cannot remain indifferent to the situation which is developing in and in regard to the Yemen and that urgent action on their part may he called for in order to parry as far as possible some of the dangers which it obviously involves. 9. Two courses of action have been suggested. The first is an attempt to negotiate a new agreement with Italy which shall expand and reaffirm the Rome Understand■’ of 1927 and bring it more closely into line with present conditions. The chief argument in favour of this course is that the Rome Understanding of 1927 is unsetisfactoril worded, and contains provisions which are no longer applicable, so that the Italians might conceivably invoke the lapse of some of its provisions or the obscurity of others as justifying them in adopting a more forward policy. On the other hand, it is clearly useless, with Italy in her present frame of mind, to attach any value whatever to any Italian treaty undertaking as such, so tha even if a more satisfactory instrument could be secured, does not follow that we should be any better off 0 The position in fact seems to be that, if the Italians think . to their interest to honour the obligations contained in the Rome Understanding of 1927, they will hardly try to equivocate about its terms, while if they do not think it to their interest to observe the existing agreement, f more carefully worded and appropriate instrument would n~ deter them from breaking their word. On the other hand, the attempt to negotiate a new instrument might easily/\ A easily lead to the situation heconing worse rather than hetter. The Italians might regard any suggestion to negotiate a new instrument as an admission that the present instrument was unsatisfactory or invalid; and, if the negotiations broke down, they might then affect to regard this as completely releasing them even from such obligations as they now have towards us. Moreover, the attempt to devise a ne / undertaking might involve the raising of a number of extremely difficult and invidious questions, and we might even find ourselves obliged to tie our own hands far more tightly than is at all desirable* 10- The second alternative is that put forward by Sir Miles Lampson in paragraph 15 of his despatch No. 225 of the 18th February and Sir Eric Drummond in his despatch Noo 218 of the 15th March, i.e. that His Majesty’s Government should take an early opportunity to make some public statement - e.g c in reply to a Parliamentary Question, formally reaffirming the statement contained in the Rome Understanding, and recognised by the Italians therein, that His Majesty s Government regard it as a vital interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian coast of the Red See. Such *a statement could not be regarded as introducing any new element into the situation, since it would merely reaffirm and restate a principle which the Italians have already formally admitted. It would, however, act as a clear warning to the Italians that we are carefully \ atching their activities in the Yemen, and that we will not remain indifferent to any attempt on their part to violate their obligations towards uso It would also give great satisfaction to King Ibn Saud and perhaps the King of the Yemen. The very vagueness/\ vagueness of the statement might he useful, since it is generally a good policy to keep people like the Italians guessing as much as possible. A draft Parliamentary Question and answer to give effect to the suggested course of action are enclosed herein to serve as a basis for discussion. . 11. On the other hand, there are certain points which must be carefully gone into before it is possible to recommend the issue of any such statement by His Majesty’s Government. 12. The first point is that it is necessary to be sure that in the event of an obvious end flagrant case arising.of a European Power attempting to establish itself on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea in such a way that its action cannot be explained away end is in obvious conflict with our avov/ed policy. His Majesty’s Government would in fact be prepared to resort to force against that Power. We should in fact be involving ourselves in a public commitment, and ought to be sure that we are prepared to implement it. 13. But it is questionable whether this commitment is in fact so new as it looks. We have already made tnis statement to the Italians and they know our views. If they were obviously to ’’establish 5 ’ themselves on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea, and we did nothing we should have suffered hardly less of a defeat and Humiliation at their hands than if we had made a public statement in Parliament here and taken no action when trie time came. It is doubtful in fact whether the new element of publicity involved really materially alters the situation, which already exists in this respect. 14. Moreover, there is no doubt from the Chiefs of Staff/v y Staff report that it is in fact a vital British interest for us to prevent the Italians from establishing themselves in the Yemen, If then we were not to resort to force, in the event of their trying to do so and refusing to yield to peaceful pressure, we should he abdicating from our recognised responsibilities, and * accepting a defeat quite incompatible with the maintenance of our Imperial interests and international position. It is questionable, then, whether, by making a declaration in the sense suggested by Sir Miles Lampson, we smould be in fact increasing our own commitments or responsibilities in any way* 15. The second point that should be considered is that of the circumstances which would in fact call the declaration into play* This has been dealt with above, and it is suggested that we can only leave this problem to be considered in the light of the circumstances existing at the time, 16. Finally, it seems essential that any declaration in the sense proposed should be brought into line with the general policy of His Majesty’s Government towards Italy. It clearly will not do to suggest that such a declaration should be made, so to speak, 'out of 'the blue', irrespective of the general course of Anglo- Italian relations. Both the moment and the manner of the proposed declaration will need carefully thinking out. The declaration - if it is to be made at all - can hardly be put off indefinitely if it is to have the effect we desire. On the other hand, if it is made prematurely it may produce yet one more of the violent hysterical reactions in Italy with which we have become so/so painfully familiar. It is for consideration then whether the proposed declaration - if it is in principle approved - might not he coupled in some way with the next important statement to he made in connexion with Anglo- Italian policy, and whether the most suitable occasion for it might not he some obviously significant date, such as, say, the 2nd July, i.e. six months exactly rafter the Anglo-Italian declaration regarding the Mediterranean.. It could perhaps form part of some general statement on Anglo-Italian relations, and he so worded as to make it clear that no new threat or v/arning was being uttered, hut that in this particular question we would regard Italy s exact observance of the Rome Understanding of 1927 as one of the criteria of her future policy towards us. 17. Certain further points, such as the answers to he given to requests for further information as to the precise meaning and effect of the declaration, if made in the form of the draft parliamentary question and answer attached hereto, will need consideration at a later stage.DRAFT QUESTION . ’’To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ’’whether His Majesty’s Government prop -se to take any ’’steps to extend the recent Anglo-Italian understanding ’’regarding the Mediterranean to other areas, notably the ’’Red See, in which the aims of His Majesty’s Government ’’and the Italian Government might cone into conflict”.

CONFIDENTIAL. &gt; • ri March 1, 1937. Section 2. [E 1242/27/91 Copy No. M . Lam/pson to Mr. Eden.—(Received March 1.) 223.) (No. Sir. Cairo, February 18, 1937. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your secret despatcli No. 81 of the 25th January, in which, with reference to my secret despatch No. 1385 of the 18th December, you ask for my further views regarding the possibilities of Italian penetration of the Yemen and on the whole question of Italian activities in Arabia in the light of such bearing as the conclusion of the Anglo-Egyptian alliance has upon it. 2. I do not believe that Italy would hesitate to violate the Rome under standing of 1927 if she felt that she could do so with impunity. We have the example of her Abyssinian adventure. I agree, however, that the Rome under standing is at least a deterrent to any early Italian invasion of the Yemen, seeing that a violation of it by Italy would free us to take our own measures in the Yemen and also to assist, should we so desire, Ibn Baud’s penetration from the north. No doubt, therefore, Italy would not embark on anything like an actual invasion of the Yemen unless she were fairly sure that we should remain passive oi* unless our hands were too full elsewhere for us to take effective action. 3. I also agree that, as things are at present, Italy's preoccupation with her task in Abyssinia is likely to make the Italian Government pause before attempting anything really drastic in the Yemen in the immediate future. 4. But I doubt whether the Italian mind is at present working along the lines of actual conquest or invasion of the Yemen. The more likely policy is one of gradual penetration beginning with the corruption of Yemeni elements and leading to the creation, perhaps on the death of the Imam if no earlier opportunity presents itself, of a native Government subservient to Italian dictates. It is to this danger that Ibn Baud is evidently and very naturally alive and, as you are aware, our secret information bears out that he is in touch with certain Yemeni elements with a view to provoking and supporting a rising in the Yemen on the Imam’s death. Maybe he hopes that such a rising would result either in his own virtual occupation of the Yemen or in the establishment of a regime subservient to himself. At all events his activities are doubtless—and again very naturally— designed to forestall the Italians and secure that the Yemen shall not fall into their hostile and powerful hand. For it is clear that a puppet Government in the Yemen supported by Italian money, arms and technical assistance, would consti tute a grave menace to Ibn Baud. In this respect Mr. Philby's wanderings on the western and northern frontiers of the Yemen are of interest, particularly the report of his reconnoitring in connexion with a motor road towards the Yemen frontier (see section 6261 of Aden Political Intelligence Summary No. 522 for the week ending the 27th January, 1937). 5. The menace is one which closely concerns ourselves. Clearly, if the Italians, through their adherents in the Yemen, were to worst Ibn Baud, we should be faced with a position gravely prejudicial to our interests in Arabia and with a threat to our communications through the Red Sea. 6 . As regards the second and wider question raised in your despatch under reply, it is self-evident that an independent Egypt will endeavour to play a prominent part in Arabian affairs. The whole trend of events points that way, and the creation of a general Egypto-Arab entente, which, we know, is in the minds of Egyptians as well as Arabs, is advanced by the Anglo-Egyptian treaty, in that Egypt gains thereby liberty of action in the foreign field, so long as not demonstrably hostile to British interests. 7. The question therefore turns primarily on how the Anglo-Egyptian treaty works. If the Egyptians play the game and behave as true allies, the Anglo-Egyptian treaty, in spite of Egyptian and Arab aspirations incompatible [956 a—2]2 in themselves with British interests, should not help Italian designs in Arabia. The Italian danger is well realised by both Arabs and Egyptians, who, if they could reach some reasonable modus vivendi with us, would probably not wish to get rid of us militarily and aerially in view of their need of our protection against Italy and of their preoccupations with their own internal difficulties. 8 Furthermore, as indicated by Mr. Kelly in his despatch No. 1039 of the&lt; 4th September last, the capacity of either Egyptians or Arabs to pursue any consistently steady policy of co-operation is limited. Nevertheless, at a time of crisis such a possibility must be reckoned with and might be dangerous. It would certainly be exploited by Italy if we played our cards badly. 9. In short, our general policy and the measure of our strength are, as I see it, the decisive factors in the situation. We have to show Egypt and the Arabs that we remain a powerful Empire ; that we will, if need be, stand no nonsense and stand up for our position and interests, but that we are at the same time an Empire which stands for just and fair dealing both with Arabs and Egyptians. Native confidence in our strength has been seriously shaken by Italy’s Abyssinian success. As I have endeaA^oured to point out in the past, our policy in regard to Abyssinia was never regarded here as a collective League effort but as a trial of strength between Great Britain and Mussolini. As regards native confidence in our fair dealing, Palestine is now the crux of the problem. While I do not suggest that we should swallow whole the Arab case against Zionism, it is essential that it should not appear to the Arab and Egyptian Governments, and to the average moderate opinion in those countries, that our weight is thrown definitely on the Zionist side. Any such conviction must create a real sense of injustice among all who speak the Arabic language or belong to the Moslem religion; and a combination between Egyptian and Arabs which began with a challenge to Zionism might end with a challenge to our military position in the Middle East. This is speculative ground, but in such circumstances it is always possible that the Egyptians and Arabs might seek to use Italy to embarrass us and Italy in turn might be afforded the opportunity of using the Egyptians and Arabs against us. 10 . If we can by our general policy retrieve the impression created by the Abyssinian fiasco and avoid the impression of injustice to the Arabs in Palestine and elsewhere, we shall have done something to diminish the dangers of Egypto- Arab solidarity and lessened the field for Italian intrigue. 11 . In any case we should not on any account ignore Italian intrigue, more particularly in the Yemen. We cannot compete with the Italians in secret intrigue in that or any other region. But we should ensure that we keep in touch with Yemeni and other Arab elements disposed to resist Italian penetration and to maintain the real independence of the Yemen. At the same time I feel most strongly that we should do everything possible to avoid discouraging Ibn Saud. His attitude has shown that he is more eager than ever for co-operation with us. His line over the Palestinian problem has shown beyond doubt to what extent he, an essentially Islamic figure, has been prepared to discourage Pales tinian extremism in order to keep in with us. His repeated approaches to us during recent years for assistance in the creation of a Saudi Air Force show' in practical form that he really wants our help. In spite of technical difficulties in the way of our giving him assistance in the matter of aviation, I most earnestly hope that a serious effort will be made to overcome them, both to prevent Italy occupying the field and to maintain our influence with Ibn Saud. He is the out standing figure in the Arab world to-day and even if it costs some financial sacrifice, which would seem a condition of any effective action, I believe we should accept that as a moderate insurance premium. (See, in this connexion, mv despatch No. 190 of the 10th February.) 12. If we continue to drift—as. without disrespect, seems at this distance to be our tendency—relying on the Rome understanding of 1927, on which I personally place little reliance, and if the Italian game of peaceful penetration in the Yemen succeeds, Ibn Saud must surely conclude that we are the wrong horse to back and I am afraid his conclusion will be justifiably shared by most, if not all, of his neighbours. . „ , . . . , ,, « n 13 \n essential point to remember m all this is that we should careiullv weio-h—and Palestine is very much a case in ]ioint—whether if we antagonise the \rabs we can cope with them and the I talians at the same time. 14 As I see it from the angle of Cairo it is particularly important during the next few years that our political contacts with the Arab world should be as3 Arabia, i, if they : wish to i against 39 of the A rsue any t time of It would , as I see he Arabs sense and time an gyptians. yvssinian ■egard to t trial of idence in I do not essential d to the le finitely injustice ion ; and llenge to die East. ‘ that the r in turn ainst us. d by the Palestine Egypto ;ue, more in secret keep in letration ae I feel spng Ibn tperation ; to what ^e Pales- les to us show in mlties in sarnestlv*- mt Italy the out- financial jq should don, mv stance to which I ration in ng horse f not all, carefully onise the t during ild be as close as possible and that we should do all we can to encourage the goodwill which is still widespread among the Arab peoples. 15. Whatever the outcome of our efforts on the lines indicated in the pre ceding paragraphs, I must once more repeat my firm conviction that we are faced ? &gt; with the alternatives indicated in paragraph 5 of my despatch No. 1385 of the-^'-'Z^''^ A l^th December last, i.e., either some conclusive and effective arrangement with Italy to protect our interest in the Red Sea or a trial of strength between ourselves and Italy. I still have no confidence in the efficacy of any agreement with Italy. On the other hand, it is clearly desirable to do everything possible to obviate the second alternative and I am tempted to wonder whether the best chance of doing so may not lie in some unilateral and public declaration of our interest in pre venting the domination by any European Power of the Arab countries bordering the Red Sea. Such a declaration might serve as an effective warning to Italy, while at the same time reassuring Ibn Sand without the necessity of entering into any direct commitment with that Monarch. It would, I fully appreciate, be necessary to avoid the appearance of any challenge or provocation to Italy, but I suggest that the Italian Government could not well object to a public statement in the sense of the first part of paragraph 1 of point 4 of the Rome understanding of the 7th February, 1927, viz., that the guiding principle in British policy in the Red Sea is the security of Imperial communications with India and the East ; and that for this purpose His Majesty’s Government regard it as a vital Imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea. Perhaps such a statement might be conveniently made in answer to a parliamentary question. This at all events is a procedure which 1 venture to suggest as worthy of consideration by His Majesty’s Government. 16 I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty s representatives at Rome, Bagdad and Jedda.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. 21st May 5 1937. • 1 Sir 9 It was recently arranged that the question of the future policy of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the Yemen should he discussed by the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee at a meeting to be held on Thursday 5 the 3rd June 5 at 3.30 p.m. 2. This question was last discussed by the Sub committee at its 48th meeting on the 14th December of last year, and, in accordance with conclusion (a) of that meeting, the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence were duly asked to report, from the strategical point of view, on the importance of the Yemen as a British imperial interest. The report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee has now been received (C.0.S.563 of the 19th February), and circulated to the departments represented on the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee, and this will naturally form the first document for consideration at the impending meeting of the-2- ( \ Middle East (Official) Sub-Cornmi ttee* 3. I an nov/ directed dy Mr.Secretary Eden to transmit to you copies of the following documents and to request that you will he so good as to cause them to he circulated to the memhers of the Sub-Committee fir- consideration at its impending meeting. (1) Despatch No.1383 of the 17th December 1936 from His Majesty's Ambassador in Cairo, enclosing a report dated the 31st October 1936 by the Sudan Government Intelligence Officer, on the general position ox nis Majesty’s Government in the Middle East. (2) Despatch No.1385 of the 18th December 1936 from His Majesty's Ambassador in Cairo, drawing attention to the dangers of increasing Italian activity in the Yemen. ( 3 ) Foreign Office despatch No.81 of the 25th January to His Majesty's Ambassador in Cairo commenting on (l) and inviting a further expression of Sir Miles Lampson's views ( 4 .) Despatch No.223 of the 18th February from His Majesty's Ambassador in Cairo replying to (s) and suggesting that His Majesty's Government should make a declaration to the effect that they would not tolerate the doruination by any European Pov/er of the Arabian countries 'bordering tlie Eed Sea. ( 5 ) Foreign Office despatch No.182 of the 24th February to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Rome recording a conversation between Mr. Kendel of the Forei^ Office and oignor Crolla, the Counsellor of the Italian Embassy in London, about the policy of His Majesty's Government and of the Italian Government in regard to the Yemen. (Note: I am to explain that the reference in paragraph 2 of this paper should be to a private letter from Ur. Ingram dated not the 16th February 1937 but the 16thSeptember, 1936, A copy of this letter is also enclosed for convenience of reference)., (6) Despatch No.41 of the 23rd March from His Majesty’s Minister in Jedda enclosing a record of various conversations between King Ibn Saud on the one hand and Sir Reader Bullard himself and Mr. Rendel, who has recently returned from a visit to Saudi Arabia, on the other.

Section 1. [E 8028/381/65] Copy No. Sir M. Lampson to Mr. Eden.—(Received December 29.) (No. 1383. Secret.) Cairo, December 17, 1936. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a note on Near Eastern Affairs written at Khartum by Mr. E. S. Attiyah, the Sudan Government Intelligence Officer, after a visit he paid to Egypt, Palestine and Syria during last summer. 2. Mr. Attiyah was educated at Victoria College, Alexandria, from which he graduated to Brazenose College, Oxford. 3. Mr. Attiyah’s report dwells first on the weakening of Great Britain’s position in the Eastern Mediterranean owing to the general native interpreta tions of Italy’s successful Abyssinian adventure and to Spanish developments. However, he believes that the majority of thinking people in these parts view with apprehension the possibility of a British eclipse, and would still be prepared to support Great Britain in any conflict between her and the Fascist Powers, provided a solution of the Palestine problem could be found acceptable to the Arabs. The failure to find such a solution must, he thinks, involve a recrudescence of armed hostility on a larger scale, involving other Arab lands. 4. He then suggests that, in addition to the settlement of the Palestinian question in a manner acceptable to the Arabs, Great Britain and trance, in order to make more secure Arab co-operation, might sponsor the creation of some sort of Arab federation under their aegis. This, I may record, is an old dream which seems no more practicable now than seventeen years ago. 5. I need not dwell on Mr. Attiyah’s picture of Egypt after the signature of the treaty. It is. on the whole, an accurate one, but it has already been presented to you in frequent reports from Mr. Kelly and myself. 6. The statement regarding the persecution of ihe Copts must be taken with a grain of salt. Many Moslems, on the contrary, are complaining that, owing to Makram’s position, Copts are at present being favoured at the expense of Moslems. This is, indeed, an obsession with the Prince Regent, who never fails to allude to it in his conversations with me. 7. With reference to the suggestion that Ahmed Maher was excluded by Nahas from the dinner given by the ex-Khedive to the latter at Carlsbad, it is possible that the exclusion w T as only due to the fact that Abbas Hilmi Pasha has not been on good terms with the Maher family generally. I draw this inference from certain information given me here by one of the ex-Khedive’s intimates. 8. Mr. Attiyah’s impressions regarding Egyptian intentions towards the Sudan are reassuring. He thinks that the Egyptians will lay stress on Egypto- Sudanese fraternisation rather than on a more active Egyptian share in the Condominium. 9. With regard to the more important part of Mr. Attiyah’s note, namely, that dealing with the Palestine question, I have on several occasions during the present year touched on its dangers to our position generally in the Near East. There appears to be a consensus of opinion among competent observers that the Arabs will not acquiesce peacefully in any solution of the question which does not assure a continuance of Arab predominance in Palestine. If His Majesty’s Government are unable to admit such a solution, then it would seem advisable to be prepared beforehand for the consequences. If, after the Royal Commission's report, His Majesty’s Government feel compelled to adopt a solution unacceptable to the Arabs, it is generally anticipated that there will be a recrudescence of trouble either in the near future or later when the Arabs have recovered from the strain of last summer’s struggle, and that the reactions in neighbouring Arab countries will be wider and stronger than during the conflict now suspended by a sort of truce. [881 ff—1] B10. It wiii be remembered that only an amelioration of Anglo-Egyptian relations through the negotiations for, and subsequent conclusion of, an Anglo- Egyptian treaty, together with an easing of the Anglo-Italian tension through our unavoidable acquiescence in the Italian victory in Abyssinia, enabled us to withdraw troops from Egypt in order to provide essential reinforcements for Palestine. The events of this year seem to show that we have not enough forces available to deal with serious trouble in more than one quarter at the same time. No doubt any such limitation will be present to the minds of ilis Majesty’s Government in determining their future policy in the Near East. 11. Even supposing, however, that Arab exhaustion were to preclude an immediate resumption of the armed struggle, an unsettled Palestine would still remain a permanent factor of disturbance in Arab lands, and even in Egypt. This factor will always be weighing in the scales against co-operation with us among numerous elements who otherwise would, as Mr. Attiyah points out, be only too anxious to co-operate with us if we could give them a chance. Moreover, it would seem probable that Moslem countries of the Near East, excluding Turkey, must, sooner or later, be drawn into collective or separate action in favour of the Palestinian Arabs. For it must be remembered that these countries are not only actuated by a sense of Moslem or Arab solidarity, but also by real apprehensions that a Jewish absorption of Palestine would inevitably involve overflows of Jews and Jewish influences into neighbouring countries. 12 It would not be safe to rely much on local factors tending to pre-occupy Arab States with their own local nationalisms and thus to indispose them to co operate with the Arabs of Palestine. Factors such as the establishment of the new regime in Iraq by coup d'Etat and the traditional isolation of Egypt may operate for a time against co-operation with the Palestinian Arabs, but in the long run the Moslem States of the Near East cannot remain indifferent to an Arab eclipse in Palestine. 13. Here I would invite attention to Reuters’ telegram of the 12th December from Jerusalem, according to which the Arab leaders in Jerusalem propose to summon a congress representative of all Arab countries in the Near and Middle East to meet in Cairo, and that Auni Bey Abdul Hadi is understood to be leaving for Cairo to discuss the project with Mustapha-el-Nahas Pasha. I have telegraphed to His Majesty’s High Commissioner in Palestine to ask if he can confirm this; but have at present not received his reply. 14. The Prince Regent asked the oriental secretary on the 13th December whether he had any other information on the subject, and, on receiving a negative answer, said that he too had none. He added that, though a couple of days ago he had had a long conversation with Nahas on many different subjects, including that of the treaty with Saudi Arabia, the Prime Minister had made no mention of any idea of such a congress here. His Royal Highness concluded, therefore, that the Egyptian Government had had no previous knowledge of the project. 15. I need hardly dwell on the inconvenience of such a congress in Cairo. But we must remember that Nahas, in addition to a certain vanity which is pushing him to seek a prominent role in this Arab drama, cannot afford to be too unsympathetic to appeals of Egypt’s Moslem neighbours. Egyptians, proud of their recent independence and their predominant economic and cultural role in the Near East, have long been proclaiming the necessity of Egypt’s playing a more active part in co-operation with Arab lands. Administrative measures even have been contemplated for this purpose, e.g.. formation of an Oriental Section in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for organisation of propaganda in the East. Even a well-disposed Egyptian Government would find it difficult to evade playing a part in a struggle so intensely interesting to the Arab and Moslem world. Their opponents, always on the look-out for pretexts to promote their partisan aims, would be quick to seize on what they would no doubt qualify as subservience to the British and betrayal of Moslem interests. The Government would probably find it difficult not to make some sort of gesture in favour of the Arabs, with a view to silencing the clamour of their opponents. 16. The situation indicated above, while disquieting to us from the point of view of our relations with the Arab States and Egypt, becomes even more disturbing in view of the powerful assistance which it is affording to Italy in her propaganda and penetration in Arabian lands and even Egypt. 17 His Majesty’s Government are fully informed of the propaganda, deliberately hostile to us, conducted by Italy in all these lands. The dangerouspossibility of Italy establishing herself in Saudi Arabia, through the training and controlling of Saudi aviation, has formed the subject of correspondence with His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda (see correspondence ending with your despatch No. 13 32 of the 2nd December, 1936). Equally notorious is the Italian penetration of the Yemen, through her agents disguised in civil functions (e.q., doctors)— through her intrigues in view of the succession of the old and sick Imam— through her provision of arms and financial facilities—through the reality of the menace she presents to the Yemen since the establishment of her East African Empire. It is possible that the Imam’s death is not so near as is repeatedly predicted, but his eventual disappearance is likely to afford an opportunity for much fishing in troubled waters, caused by rivalries among the Imam’s sons and certain tribal elements. Italy will, no doubt, make the most of any opportunities afforded to her by any internal confusion in the Yemen. 18. It is obvious that all this Italian effort will be greatly facilitated by the continuance and development of Arab hostility to Great Britain, owing to an unsettled situation in Palestine. The Arabs are aware of the Italian danger to themselves, but despair is a bad counsellor, and, if the choice were to appear to them to lie between the Zionist absorption in Palestine, with its menace to the Arab world generally, and of co-operation with Italy against Great Britain and France, who, after all, are in the position of standing in the way of Arab aspira tions, it is greatly to be feared that the second alternative might appear to them the least fatal. 19. It is not within my province to express opinions regarding the internal problem of Palestine, and it is only on the external reactions to that problem that I am venturing to dwell. Whatever may be the necessities of the Palestinian issue, I would earnestly urge that, anyhow, it be not examined in isolation from our whole position in the Near East, and that we consider carefully whether we have the means of maintaining our position in the Near East against an Italian thrust facilitated by Arab co-operation, based on despair of us and an appre hensive respect of Italian power as demonstrated by the conquest of Abyssinia. 20 I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Commis sioner for Palestine, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, and His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. I have. &amp;c. MILES W. LAMPSON, High Commissioner. Enclosure. Note by the Sudan Government Intelligence Officer, dated October 31, 1936, on Impressions and Information gathered during his Visits to Egypt, Syria and Palestine in the Summer of 1936. (Secret.) THERE have been three predominant topics of interest in the Near East this summer :— (a) The Italo-Abyssinian affair and its termination: (b) The Palestine troubles; and {c) The treaties between England and Egypt and between France and Syria. The treaties are the only bright spot in an otherwise very gloomy picture. 2. I am sorry to state that as a result of the Italo-Abyssinian business British prestige has suffered an extremely severe set-back in the Near East. Italy’s bold and successful adventure is regarded everywhere as a serious reverse for the British Empire; for the League aspect of the matter is considered to be nothing more than an elaborate piece of window-dressing designed to camouflage an essentially Imperialist duel between Britain and Italy—and for the first time the Arab and Islamic world has seen the British Empire successfully challenged over a big issue in and around the Mediterranean basin. The Spanish civil war, coming immediately on top of the Italian victory in Abyssinia, and implying (as it seems to most observers to imply) another Fascist triumph to the detriment of British and French democracy, has unfortunately enhanced the newly created [881 ff—1] ' b 24 impression of England’s vulnerability, so that many people in Egypt, I alestine and Syria are wondering whether really England s supremacy in the Aieditei- ranean basin and the East is not approaching its end. Everywhere one comes across feelings of insecurity and fear—chiefly experienced by intelligent and thinking persons, for in spite of all the clashes that have occurred since the war between Near East nationalism and llritish policy, tbeie aie few thinking individuals in that part of the w’orld who do not ^till believe that British ascendancv is the ultimate preserver of order and stability in the East, and who (provided Oreat Britain is whiling to satisfy some of then deepest aspirations) would not dread the prospect of its being seriously challenged. 3. In order, however, that the Moslem peoples of the Near East should give their support to England in any conflict that might break out between her and the Fascist Pow^ers^ one imperative condition must be fulfilled—namely, the solution (if a solution can be found at this stage) of the Palestine problem in a manner acceptable to the Arabs. For Palestine has definitely become the focus of Arab-Moslem feeling all over the Near East—the treatment of her problem will react profoundly in Syria, Transjordan, Iraq, Arabia and even Egypt. 4. The Arabs of Palestine, supported by their co-religionists in all the neighbouring Arab States, are now determined to fight to the death against the policy embodied in the Balfour declarations. They have made up their minds that they will not allows their country to become a national home for the Jews, absorbing more and more Jew ish immigrants, and coming more and more under Jewish political control. The strike they carried out, and the determined self- sacrificing desperation that was behind it, and that one saw in every Arab one spoke to in Palestine this summer, is a fairly clear indication of this back- to-the-wall resolve. The cessation of the strike is nothing more than an armistice. The country for the time being w^as tired; 20,000 troops had arrived in Palestine, and the orange export season was at hand. If the strike was allowed to ruin this season the country would have been financially weakened to a disastrous degree. Moie- over, the Royal Commission seemed to offer a chance which the leaders on the advice of the Arab King decided to take. Should, however, the British Govern ment refuse to modify their policy—in other words, should they decide to uphold the policy of the Balfour declaration, it is practically certain that the trou le will break out again—probably on a larger scale, involving the active co-operation of the Arabs in Iraq, Transjordan, &amp;c. „ 5. In order, howover, to gain the goodwill of the Arabs of the Near East to an extent that would make Britain’s position among them really secure m t e none too improbable event of another European war. a more comprehensive am constructive policy than the mere pacification of Palestine is requned^ 1 e Arabs still cling ardently to their dream of an Arab State, or, at least a federa tion of Arab States. They bitterly remember that England promised to help them achieve this ideal during the war. and accuse her of having betrayed them at the conclusion of it. It is certain that if another w r ar breaks out, while the Arabs are still feeling as they are to-day, they will refuse to believe any more pi onuses, and, while harbouring no love for Italy or Germany, will pursue a purely opportunist line and seize the occasion to realise their long-cherished ambitions in whatever way they can do so. To-day there is not a single Arab in Palestine who has any love for Italy. Yet it is an open secret that the Palestine revolt has been helped by Italy with money and arms. 6. In view of all this one wonders whether it would not be possible for Britain and France, acting jointly (since it is the two of them that control the destinies of the Arabs—and since, moreover, it is more than likely that they will find themselves once again fighting a common battle in the event of another war), to sponsor the creation of some sort of an Arab State Federation under their segis. France has now signed a treaty with Syria—England has a treaty with Iraq. Palestine is, of course, the chief difficulty, but if that was overcome, even perhaps without the co-operation of France,* Britain might be able to do something along these lines. Egypt and the Treaty. 7. As was to be expected, the treaty has on the whole been well received in Egypt. The opposition to it among some of the minority groups (one can scarcely call them parties) is of a largely factious nature—although there are a numberof individual politicians and journalists in the ranks of the minority who are imbued with the constitutional necessity of organising an opposition immediately in the interests of democratic government, and who not unnaturally see in the treaty the first legitimate target for their criticism. 8. The Sudan part of the treaty is regarded as being rather vague, and Au'e is considerable confusion of thought as to how it will be implemented, e.g., number of troops to be returned, number of Egyptians to be employed in administrative posts in the Sudan, the exact functions of the senior Egyptian officer, &amp;c. 9. The post of Inspector-General of Egyptian Irrigation is likely to go to Abd-el-Qawi Bey Ahmed, who from our point of view (as well as from the Egyptian) would be an excellent choice. I saw Abd-el-Qawi Bey himself, and he told me privately that he was hoping to get the appointment, the only considera tion militating against him being the fact that he was not a Wafdist. As, however, the Wafd is somewhat poor in first-class men of the type of Abd-el-Qawi Bey, Nahas will have to recruit a few servants from outside the Wafd ranks, and Abd-el-Qawi Bey may well be one of them. 10. The minority groups, as well as patriotic individual observers, view the future with considerable misgivings. They rightly hold that the next few' years wTll be a decisive period in Egypt’s history. The responsibility for what happens in Egypt can no longer be laid on the British Government. It is now exclusively held by the Egyptians themselves, and everything depends on how the Wafd is going to conduct itself. The omens are none too good, but one, of course, must make allowances for the initial period. Everywhere one hears of disquieting signs—and often one hears them from intelligent and disillusioned Egyptians. In the first place, the Copts are being persecuted, and this in spite of the prominent part they have played in the Wafd, and of the fact that they have two Ministers in the Cabinet, one of whom. Makram Pasha, is known to dominate Nahas. Nahas himself is not fanatical, but there is still a good deal of fanaticism among his followers, and Makram is too careful of his position and popularity to take any risks on behalf of his co-religionists. Again private influence, nepotism and corruption are extremely rife, and that old evil, the unjust distribution of irrigation water in the provinces, is becoming very acute; every Deputy who owns agricultural land uses his influence over the local irrigation authorities to obtain preferential treatment, and sometimes the Deputy’s wishes are confirmed by an order from the Minister. 11. It is, of course, only human that the Wafd, reaching the land of milk and honey after so many years in the wilderness, should desire to enjoy some personal refreshment on their arrival. One must not forget that, even in enlightened European democracies (the few that remain of them), party followers have to be rewarded on the attainment of office by their party; or that in France, for instance, the private influence of the Deputies is often scandalously exerted for personal ends. The British are too often inclined to judge conditions in the East by the admittedly austere standards of public life in England. Their perspective w'ould be more correct and their outlook more tolerant if they adopted America or France as a standard of comparison. A much more serious danger is the existence of the new student organisations. 12. Wearing coloured shirts, these bodies of unruly young men have now definitely learned the Fascist secret of imposing an imperium in imperio by means of organised terrorism. I heard during my stay in Cairo that several opponents of the treaty had been threatened by the Blue Shirts (Wafdists) with physical violence if they aired their views too freely; while Makram, I was told, was believed to be in danger of being assassinated by the Green Shirts, who held him responsible for the treaty of which they did not approve. 13. The split in the Wafd itself (Nahas and Makram versus Maher and Nokrashi) is more acute than it ever has been. Abd-el-Qawi Bey told me that when Nahas, Makram and Maher were at Carlsbad this summer after the signing of the treaty, the ex-Khedive sent a message to Nahas inviting the three of them to dinner, Nahas’s answer was that he and Makram would be pleased to dine with Effendina, but that Maher need not be with them, and, in spite of the Khedive’s espostulations, the venerable leader insisted on ruling out the President of the Chamber of Deputies. It is quite likely that this split will one day come to a head, in which event both factions will probably try to establish a dictatorship with the help of theBlue Shirts. Maher and Nokrashi will not come into the open yet, as they realise that the magic of Nahas’s name with the masses would be too much for them at the present stage; but if the people become dissatisfied through maladministra tion. and Nahas begins to lose in office the halo which he developed in opposition under the blows of Sidky’s policemen, then those two masters of secret organisation and the political plot (it is Nokrashi actually who controls the party machine!^ of the Wafd) might decide to strike at their leader. 14. The chief trouble with Egypt is that its political and civil life is still controlled by that old clique of politicians who were either brought up in the traditions of the corrupt Turkish school or received their training in the demagogic days of the Nationalist movement. A new generation of public- spirited civil servants is beginning to appear, but it is still small, and it will be some time before it displaces the older clique. The most outstanding personality of this new generation is Amin Osman, the new Under-Secretary for Finance, who before long will be in the Cabinet. The Egyptian Attitude to the Sudan under the New Regime. 15. For some time to come, at least, the official Egyptian attitude to the Sudan will, I believe, be correct. Nahas means to behave himself and create a good impression; and it is unlikely that the implementation of the treaty will cause us any trouble. The Egyptians will now concentrate on developing ties with the Sudan—visits, financial help to schools, possibly (though not very likely) economic projects, &amp;c. Occasionally, of course, we may have embarrassing incidents, outbursts of indiscretions, &amp;c., such as may very likely attend on the proposed visit to us this winter of 100 Egyptian students. There will be at the beginning, that is to say, a good deal of fraternisation, repeated emphasis on the ties that bind the two countries together, &amp;c. As, however, the Sudanese themselves would not welcome any suggestion that the treaty has given Egypt new rights in the Sudan, and as the Egyptians are anxious not to appear to their darker cousins to be claiming any sort of right over them, they will, I think, exercise caution and restraint. The Egyptians have been made to realise (by the Fagr articles, by Sheikh Ahmed Othman-el-Qadi’s conversa tions in Egypt, &amp;c.), that any over-insistence by them on their share in the Condominium would stress their character as rulers in Sudanese eyes; and that the Sudanese would resent their appearance in this role. Hence the stress, from their side, will be not so much on their active share in the Condominium as on fraternisation under the protection of the Condominium. And personally, I believe that any excess of interest they show in the Sudan during the next few years as a result of the treaty will gradually decrease as the novelty of the new regime wears off.1385. (820/4/36) SECRET THE RESIDENCY, CAIRO, December 18, 1936. Sir, Since my despatch No. 1383 of December l?th was written, I have received your despatch No. 1155 (ji /34-4-/2oi7/9i) enclosing a record of a conversation between the Saudi Minister in London and Lr. Rendel on November 23rd. 2. I have read this report with especial interest seeing that it very much bears out the train of ideas elaborated in my despatch under reference. The information in King Ibn 3aud r s possession clearly confirms what we nave heard from other independent sources, namely an intensificatioii of Italian intrigue in the Yemen. 3. I have never disguised the extreme gravity with which I view one situation that is apparently now developing. At great pains we have been elaborating with Egypt arrangements for the safeguarding of the Suez Canal as an essential link in our Imperial Communications. I trust I am in error in fearing that those communications risk being blocked by Italy at the other (southern) end of the Red Sea. 4. Viewed from that angle, the present overture of King Ibn Saud through his Minister as recorded in Lr. Rendel’s note strikes ne as being of the highest potential importance; and I most earnestly trust that it be not lightly turned dov/n or ignored. ibn Saud, who is a particularly The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., e tc., etc., etc. powerful/V powerful character and the dominant factor in Arah politics to-day, is doubtless acting mainly through motives of self-interest; so indeed are v/e. But it seems to me clear from what the Saudi Minister said that Ibn Saud fears tnat the Italians, having gained the domination - if not indeed the annexation - of the Yemen will next turn their attention to the neighbouring Hedjaz and other contiguous Saudi territory. Clearly it is one thing to have the Imam as a neighbour: it is quite another to have the Italians. 5. I have long felt convinced that we are approaching the parting of the ways with Italy, who, having annexed Abyssinia was certain sooner or later - and probably sooner rather than later - to try and do the same thing across the Red Sea in the Yemen. X am more convinced than ever that that is her aim and ambition. If I am correct - and I believe I am - there seems to me only two alternatives: (a) some arrangement with Italy that will definitely check her expansion at the Southern end of the Red Sea and prevent this threat to our interests; (b) a trial of strength with Great Britain to ensure that such expansion does not take place. 6. I am well aware of the present conversations between London and Rome with a view to a 'detente' in our relations. And I trust I may not be considered out of order or an alarmist if, nonetheless, I formally record my doubt whether any understanding with Italy in her present mood of cocksureness is going to achieve what we want, or put an/an end to the growing threat to the safety of our communications at the Southern end of the Red Sea, coupled with the safety of Perim and our possession of Aden. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, to the Chief Commissioner and Resident and Commander-in-Chief, Aden, and to the Governor-General of the Sudan. * I have, etc., (Sgd.)

Sir, I have read with interest Your Excellency’s Secret despatch No. 1385 (820/4/36) of the 18th December regarding the question of Italian activities in the Yemen. I am fully alive to the most disquieting features of the situation discussed in your despatch and the question of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in this matter is forming the subject of consideration in the Midale East Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. 2. In the meantime, while I do not wish to minimise the dangers of the position, there are certain considerations which suggest that the Italian Government may not be so firmly determined on a policy of intensive penetration in the Yemen as has sometimes been suggested. I shall welcome an early expression of your views on the following considerations. 3. In the first place, as you are aware, the Italian Government have virtually undertaken in the Rome understaading with His Majesty’s Government of 1927 not to establish themselves at any point on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. I realise- that it would be unwise to place too much reliance on such an undertaking on the part of the Italian Government but it should be noted that it is accompanied by a corresponding virtual undertaking on the part of His Majesty’s/ His i acallency Sir 1*U«* l .C • £«$#, 4tC. f Cairo*\ w Majesty’s Government that they also will not establish themselves on any point of the Arabian coast of the Red Sea; and that the Italian Government have in the past shown that'they attach great importance to this undertaking to which they have frequently appealed^ The view has more than once been expressed that one of the many motives inspiring Italian policy to-day is a fear that Kis Majesty's Government may themselves be aiming at some extension of their territorial or political influence in Arabia, Such a fear is unfounded, but to the Italian mind it may appear to possess some reality, and it cannot, therefore, be entirely excluded in considering Italian policy in this area. The Italians no doubt realise that if they were to violate the Rome understanding of 1927 they would thereby free His Majesty’s Government from any obligation under that under standing, They would thus enable His Majesty’s Government to occupy any area they desired in the Yemen such as, for example, Sheikh Said or the hinterland in the neighbourhood of the Aden Protectorate frontier near Taiz (where indeed British control might be welcomed). Moreover, they would justify His Majesty’s Government in entering into closer and more intimate relations with King Ibn Saud, 4. No doubt Italian local authorities in Africa and officers of the Italian Army, Navy and Air Force - looking at this question from the purely military, naval or air point of view - are anxious to secure for themselves a position of predominant influence in the Yemen, But in view of the considerations urged above it is questionable whether the Italian Government in Rome, v/ho are fully aware of the magnitude/ Imagnitude of their task in Abyssinia and of the risks involved in any new adventure in Arabia, are as eager as the Italian fighting services to pursue a definitely aggressive policy on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. 5. The above considerations are not conclusive, but they deserve to be taken into account in any appreciation of the situation. In addition to your observations on them, I desire to learn your views on the whole question of Italian activities in Arabia in the light of such bearing as, in your opinion, the conclusion of the Anglo- ■Egyptian alliance has upon it. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador in Rome and to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda. I am, etc., (For the Secretary of State) (Sgd.) J.C. Sterndale Bennett.!

Lampson to Mr. Eden.—(Received March 1.) (No. 223.) i^ir. Cairo, February 18, 1937. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your secret despatch No. 81 of the 25th January, in which, with reference to my secret despatch No. 1385 of the 18th December, you ask for my further views regarding the possibilities of Italian penetration of the Yemen and on the whole question of Italian activities in Arabia in the light of such bearing as the conclusion of the Anglo-Egyptian alliance has upon it. 2. I do not believe that Italy would hesitate to violate the Rome under standing of 1927 if she felt that she could do so with impunity. We have the example of her Abyssinian adventure. I agree, however, that the Rome under standing is at least a deterrent to any early Italian invasion of the Yemen, seeing that a violation of it by Italy would free us to take our own measures in the Yemen and also to assist, should we so desire, Ibn Baud's penetration from the north. No doubt, therefore, Italy would not embark on anything like an actual invasion of the Yemen unless she were fairly sure that we should remain passive or unless our hands were too full elsewhere for us to take effective action. 3. I also agree that, as things are at present, Italy’s preoccupation with her task in Abyssinia is likely to make the Italian Government pause before attempting anything really drastic in the Yemen in the immediate future. 4. But I doubt whether the Italian mind is at present working along the lines of actual conquest or invasion of the Yemen. The more likely policy is one of gradual penetration beginning with the corruption of Yemeni elements and leading to the creation, perhaps on the death of the Imam if no earlier opportunity presents itself, of a native Government subservient to Italian dictates. It is to this danger that Ibn Baud is evidently and very naturally alive and, as you are aware, our secret information bears out that he is in touch with certain Yemeni elements with a view to provoking and supporting a rising in the Yemen on the Imam's death. Maybe he hopes that such a rising would result either in his own virtual occupation of the Yemen or in the establishment of a regime subservient to himself. At all events his activities are doubtless—and again very naturally— designed to forestall the Italians and secure that the Yemen shall not fall into their hostile and powerful hand. For it is clear that a puppet Government in the Yemen supported by Italian money, arms and technical assistance, would consti tute a grave menace to Ibn Baud. In this respect Mr. Philby’s wanderings on the western and northern frontiers of the Yemen are of interest, particularly the report of his reconnoitring in connexion with a motor road towards the Yemen frontier (see section 6261 of Aden Political Intelligence Summary No. 522 for the week ending the 27th January, 1937). 5. The menace is one which closely concerns ourselves. Clearly, if the Italians, through their adherents in the Yemen, were to worst Ibn Baud, we should be faced with a position gravely prejudicial to our interests in Arabia and with a threat to our communications through the Red Sea. 6. As regards the second and wider question raised in your despatch under reply, it is self-evident that an independent Egypt will endeavour to play a prominent part in Arabian affairs. The whole trend of events points that way, and the creation of a general Egypto-Arab entente, which, we know, is in the minds of Egyptians as well as Arabs, is advanced by the Anglo-Egyptian treaty, in that Egypt gains thereby liberty of action in the foreign field, so long as not demonstrably hostile to British interests. 7. The question therefore turns primarily on how the Anglo-Egyptian treaty works. If the Egyptians play the game and behave as true allies, the Anglo-Egyptian treaty, in spite of Egyptian and Arab aspirations incompatible [956 a—2]2 in themselves with British interests, should not help Italian designs m Arabia. The Italian danger is well realised by both Arabs and Egyptians, who, it t ie\ could reach some reasonable modus vivendi with us, would probably not wish to get rid of us militarily and aerially in view of their need of our protection against Italy and of their preoccupations with their own internal difficulties. '8. Furthermore, as indicated by Mr. Kelly in his despatch No. 1039 ot the 4th September last, the capacity of either Egyptians or Arabs to pursue any consistently steady policy of co-operation is limited. Nevertheless, at a time ot crisis such a possibility must be reckoned with and might be dangerous. It would certainly be exploited by Italy if we played our cards badly. 9. In short, our general policy and the measure of our strength are, as I see it, the decisive factors in the situation. We have to show 7 Egypt and the Arabs that we remain a powerful Empire; that we will, if need be, stand no nonsense and stand up for our position and interests, but that we are at the same time an Empire w r hich stands for just and fair dealing both with Arabs and Egyptians. Native confidence in our strength has been seriously shaken by Italy s Abyssinian success. As I have endeavoured to point out in the past, our policy in regard to Abyssinia was never regarded here as a collective League effort hut as a trial of strength between Great Britain and Mussolini. As regards native confidence in our fair dealing, Palestine is now the crux of the problem. While I do not suggest that w r e should sw r allow whole the Arab case against Zionism, it is essential that it should not appear to the Arab and Egyptian Governments, and to the average moderate opinion in those countries, that our weight is throw n definitely on the Zionist side. Any such conviction must create a real sense of injustice among all who speak the Arabic language or belong to the Moslem religion; and a combination between Egyptian and Arabs which began with a challenge to Zionism might end with a challenge to our military position in the Middle East. This is speculative ground, but in such circumstances it is always possible that the Egyptians and Arabs might seek to use Italy to embarrass us and Italy in turn miqbt be afforded the opportunity of using the Egyptians and Arabs against us. 10. If we can by our general policy retrieve the impression created by the Abyssinian fiasco and avoid the impression of injustice to the Arabs in Palestine and elsewhere, we shall have done something to diminish the dangers of Egypto- Arab solidarity and lessened the field for Italian intrigue. 11. In any case we should not on any account ignore Italian intrigue, more particularly in the Yemen. We cannot compete with the Italians in secret intrigue in that or any other region. But we should ensure that we keep in touch with Yemeni and other Arab elements disposed to resist Italian penetration and to maintain the real independence of the Yemen. At the same time I feel most strongly that we should do everything possible to avoid discouraging Ibn Sand. His attitude has shown that he is more eager than ever for co-operation with us. His line over the Palestinian problem has shown beyond doubt to what extent he, an essentially Islamic figure, has been prepared to discourage Pales tinian extremism in order to keep in with us. His repeated approaches to us during recent years for assistance in the creation of a Saudi Air Force show 7 in practical form that he really wants our help. In spite of technical difficulties in the way of our giving him assistance in the matter of aviation, I most earnestlv*- hope that a serious effort will be made to overcome them, both to prevent Italy occupving the field and to maintain our influence with Ibn Saud. Fie is the out standing 1 figure in the Arab world to-day and even if it costs some financial sacrifice, which w'ould seem a condition of any effective action, I belie\e we should accept that as a moderate insurance premium. (See, in this connexion, mv despatch No. 190 of the 10th February.) . ,. 12 If we continue to drift—as. without disrespect, seems at this distance to be our tendency—relying on the Rome understanding of 1927, on which I personally place little reliance, and if the Italian game of peaceful penetration m the Yemen succeeds, Ibn Saud must surely conclude that we are the wrong horse to back and I am afraid his conclusion will be justifiably shared by most, if not all, of his^ne g^ egsential p oint t0 re member in all this is that we should carefully wei°h—and Palestine is very much a case in point—whether if we antagonise the Arabs we can cope with them and the Italians at the same time. 14 As I see it from the angle of Cairo it is particularly important ^nng the next few years that our political contacts with the Arab world should be as c i: 0 I 1 a C Si Si V t: V a n S' t] t I t ii t a s I3 .rabia. f they ish to gainst of the ^ ie any ime of would s I see Arabs se and me an utians. sinian ard to rial of nee iu do not ^ential to the initely justice i; and age to * East, lat the n turn nst us. by the lestine gyp to- i, more secret eep in oration I feel ig Ibn ^ration d what Pales- 5 tO US low in ties in rnestlv*- t Italy be out- lancial should m, my nice to hich I tion in y horse not all, refully lise the during 1 be as close as possible and that we should do all we can to encourage the goodwill which is still widespread among the Arab peoples. 15. Whatever the outcome of our efforts on the lines indicated in the pre ceding paragraphs, I must once more repeat my firm conviction that we are faced ^ith the alternatives indicated in paragraph 5 of my despatch No. 1385 of the 8th December last, i.e., either some conclusive and effective arrangement with Italy to protect our interest in the Red Sea or a trial of strength between ourselves and Italy. I still have no confidence in the efficacy of any agreement with Italy. On the other hand, it is clearly desirable to do everything possible to obviate the second alternative and I am tempted to wonder whether the best chance of doing so may not lie in some unilateral and public declaration of our interest in pre venting the domination by any European Power of the Arab countries bordering the Red Sea. Such a declaration might serve as an effective warning to Italy, while at the same time reassuring Ibn Saud without the necessity of entering into any direct commitment with that Monarch. It would, I fully appreciate, be necessary to avoid the appearance of any challenge or provocation to Italy, but I suggest that the Italian Government could not well object to a public statement in the sense of the first part of paragraph 1 of point 4 of the Rome understanding of the 7th February, 1927, viz., that the guiding principle in British policy in the Red Sea is the security of Imperial communications with India and the East; and that for this purpose His Majesty’s Government regard it as a vital Imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea. Perhaps such a statement might be conveniently made in answer to a parliamentary question. This at all events is a procedure which I venture to suggest as worthy of consideration by His Majesty s Government. 16.

LAMPSON.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). February 24. 1937. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 784/27/91] Copy No. Mr. Eden to Sir E. Drummond (Rome). (No. 182.) Sir, Foreign Office, February 24, 1937. THE counsellor of the Italian Embassy called here on the 3rd February in order to discuss Anglo-Italian relations in the Red Sea area. He said that the Italian Government had been rendered uneasy at the recent journeys of Captain Seager (the British frontier officer on the Aden-Yemeni frontier) from Aden to Sanaa, and of Mr. Philby to the Hadramaut. Signor Crolla seemed rather confused about these journeys, and at times spoke of Mr. Philby’s journeys to the coast of the Persian Gulf, where, as was explained to him, Mr. Philby had not been for many years. But it appeared that the reference to these journeys was merely intended to introduce the subject, and that the real object of his visit was to say that Italy relied entirely on, and held firmly to, the Rome under standing of 1927. and to express the hope that His Majesty’s Government themselves were prepared to continue equally to base themselves on that instrument. 2. Signor Crolla was told in reply that it must be self-evident that His Majesty’s Government could have no ambitions in the Arabian peninsula, and no wish to increase their responsibilities by adopting any kind of forward policy beyond the areas already under their sovereignty or protection. Their policy, as the Italian Government must know, was the maintenance of the status quo. 3. As regards the journeys to which Signor Crolla had particularly alluded, Captain Seager was, as the Italian Government were aware, the British frontier officer on the Aden-Yemeni frontier. His Majesty’s Government had no repre sentatives in the Yemen, but the fact that they had a common frontier with that country naturally led to the necessity for discussing various frontier questions of common interest. In the circumstances, it seemed entirely natural that Captain Seager should go to Sanaa from time to time, in the ordinary course of his work as a frontier officer, in order to keep in contact with the Yemeni officials. As regards Mr. Philby, it was no doubt universally believed abroad that he was a British agent, but it must be sufficiently obvious that such activities as his recent incursion into the Aden Protectorate were hardly those of a British agent. Signor Crolla was then given a brief account of Mr. Philby’s career, and told that the Italian Government should not be misled by the ridiculous reports to which Mr. Philby’s adventures inevitably gave rise. He eventually said that the Italian Government were under no misapprehension on this point and did not take Mr. Philby seriously. He did not explain, however, why he had referred to him at the outset of the conversation. 4. Signor Crolla was then told that, while it. seemed fairly clear that His Majesty's Government could have no conceivable object in attempting to extend their responsibilities in Arabia, the position was not so simple as regards Italy. Italy made no secret of having embarked on a forward policy, and. whatever the attitude of the authorities in Rome might be. it could not be denied that there had been a great deal of loose talk in local Italian military and naval circles about the obvious strategic advantages which Italy might obtain if she secured a foothold in the Yemen. It was no doubt unnecessary to attach excessive importance to such remarks, but this kind of talk had unquestionably created a great deal of uneasiness in certain quarters. 5. Signor Crolla said that any such uneasiness was entirely unjustified. Italy had her hands more than full in Abyssinia, and the last thing she wanted was an Arabian adventure. In any case, her policy was to adhere firmly to the undertakings of the Rome understanding of 1927. and he wished to give a formal and categorical assurance to this effect. The Italian Government, for their part, had. he repeated, certainly felt some uneasiness at Captain Seager’s journev! There had been reports to the effect that he had discussed with the Imam the 931 aa—1]possible cession or lease of certain points on the Red Sea coast. These rumours, though they were unconfirmed, had given rise to much suspicion as to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. Signor Crolla was told that these stories were entirely ridiculous. It was just as much to the interest of His Majesty’s Government as to that of Italy to adhere strictly to the undertakings contained in the Rome understanding. The last thing which His Majesty’s Government^ could have contemplated was to have attempted, in violation of those undertakings, 4 to obtain any cession or lease of this sort from the Imam, even if there had been any prospect of the Imam considering such suggestions. In any case, Signor Crolla could regard wdiat was being said to him as a formal assurance that nothing of the sort had ever been contemplated, and that such action would be entirely contrary to the basic principles of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in Arabia, which were the strict maintenance of the independence and integrity of the two Arabian States, that is to say, of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. Signor Crolla, after expressing appreciation of this assurance, said that he felt that the detente in Anglo-Italian relations ought to be extended to the Middle East as well, and that he would like to see the Rome understanding of 1927 developed. He was given no encouragement to pursue this line, but he went on to explain that the Italian Government attached importance to the observance of the provisions in the Rome understanding for Anglo-Italian consultation. 6. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives at Cairo and Jedda. I am, &amp;c. ANTHONY EDEN.Copy (E 6026/2617/91) 211/2/36.. British Embassy, 16th September, 1936, Rome. My dear George, Your letter of the 7th September (E 5523/2617/91) on the subject of Italian designs on the Yemen. You have no doubt by now seen our despatch No.S50 (203/1/36) of the 29th August on this subject. There is really not a great deal which we can add to the information contained in that despatch. At various times since the conclusion of the Italo-Yemenite Treaty in 1926 there have been rumours that Italy was casting an acquisitive eye on the Yemen, but at the same time and up till last year, the Italian authorities showed a desire to allay these suspicions as far as possible. e ought not, however, to forget the speech v/hich Signor Mussolini made to the Quinquennial Fascist Assembly in 1934. In this speech, to which we drew your special attention in our despatch No.950 and which formed the subject of the Embassy 1 s despatch No. 245 (189/2/34) of the 19th March, 1934, he said that 'Italy’s historical 'objectives have two names: Asia and Africa. South and 'east are the cardinal points which should stimulate the interest and determination of Italians. Northwards there is little or nothing to be done; nor is there more to 'be done westwards neither in Europe nor beyond the ocean. 'These objectives of ours have their justification in geography ano in nistory. Of all the great western- 'Powers of Europe the nearest to Africa and to Asia ia G. vr . Rendel, Esq. , C.M.G. 'Italy/'’Italy# A few hours by sea, fewer still by ai'r, suffice ”to join Italy to Africa and Asia. Let no one misunder- ’’stand the scope of this secular task which I assign to 'this and future Italian generations. It is not a matter ”of territorial conquests, and let this be understood by ”all near and far alike, but of a natural expansion v/hich 'should lead to collaboration between Italy and the peoples 'of Africa, between Italy and the nations of the Near and 'kiddle East.' As an assurance of peaceful intentions Signor kussolini’s declaration has of course proved valueless in the event, but it is perhaps of some interest as an open indication, if one were needed, of Italian aspirations in the Near and Middle East. There can be no real doubt that Italy desires to increase her influence in that part of the world and there is every reason to suppose that she would be glad enough to establish a footing on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea if a favourable opportunity offered. All this, however, does not mean that Signor Mussolini has already prepared plans for an early advance against the Yemen. On the contrary we believe that while there are no doubt not a few Italians - and some of them perhaps in high places - v/ho are casting covetous glances at the Arabian shores of the Red Sea, no serious authority contemplates any forward action in that area for the moment. Italy has trouble enough on her hands, particularly in the economic and financial spheres, and of covirse Abyssinia has still to be digested; indeed, the greater part, of that country has not yet even been swallowed. Italy’s/r Italy's foreign policy is essentially opportunist and I therefore hesitate to venture any prophecy as to future trends. iwy own personal view is that Italy will quietly hut determinedly make a drive during the next few years at undermining our influence in the Arab and Moslem world; so we must be prepared for intrigue of every sort. But I doubt whether they will 'strike' just yet. They are more likely to concentrate on preparing the ground, perhaps in the hope that they may eventually be able to get what they want without having to 'strike' at all. Yours ever, (3gd.) E.M•B. Ingram.1 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT IN my despatch No. 40, dated the 23rd March, I reported that during Mr. Rendel’s short stay in Jedda. from the 17th to 22nd March, we had several interviews with His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. I now have the honour to enclose a summary of these conversations. The conversations themselves and unavoidable hospitality occupied most of the time during the last two and half days, so that there was not time to make a complete record before Mr. Renders departure. 2. It might have been more satisfactory to divide the record up into portions according to the various subjects discussed, and to send each portion separately with a covering despatch, but there is not time to do this before the bag goes, and in any case the subjects overlap a good deal. Where comment seems to be called for I hope to send it by the following bag. and the question of Palestine, at any rate, requires a telegram. 3. In two or three places I have inserted material which may appear to be remote from present-day politics, e.g., references to Ibn Saud’s relations with the Sherif (later King) Hussein and to his dealings with British officials in the Persian Gulf before the war. I think these references are relevant as showing that the mind of the King is always roving back to the times when, as he thinks, he deserved well of Plis Majesty’s Government and reflecting that he has got precious little out of it. I am not saying, at the moment, that any bitterness that Ibn Saud feels on this score is justified, but only that it exists. 4. I have been more than six months at this post, but it was not until now that I could come into contact with the man who directs foreign affairs, as he directs everything else in Saudi Arabia, The peculiar position in which foreign representatives are placed in this country is familiar to you, but it may be of use to illustrate it from my short experience. I arrived at Jedda in the middle of last September, and presented credentials to and dined with the Amir Feisal. a purely nominal Minister for Foreign Affairs, who at once retreated to the hills of Taif. The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fuad Bey, was on leave, and did not return until towards the end of November, and for two months I saw no one connected with foreign affairs except the King’s secretary. Yusuf Yasin, who came to Jedda at the end of September to arrange for the exchange of notes about the Treaty of Jedda and connected matters, communicated a long statement from the King about foreign affairs, and retired to the other side of Arabia. Between the return of Fuad Bey towards the end of November and his hurried and surprising departure on leave a few days before Mr. Rendel was due to arrive, I have had occasional interviews—sometimes at tiresomely long intervals—with Fuad Bey. whom there is reason to think that the King does not entirely trust, and who I think has misled me on one or two occasions. 5. I may mention that during the course of the conversations reported in the enclosure the King twice said that he hoped I would pay him a visit at Riyadh. For many reasons such a visit is not to be undertaken lightly, but it may be useful to have the invitation in hand if matters of importance have to be dealt with and no satisfaction can be obtained here during the long interval between two successive annual visits of the King to Jedda. the only place in Saudi Arabia where a foreign representative is allowed to reside. 6.

Record of conversations in the course of interviews granted by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz to Sir Reader Bullard and Mr. Rendel on March 20, 21 and 22, 1937. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba were present throughout, and the Amir Feisal appeared on two occasions^ Sheikh Hafiz Wahba and Sir Reader Bullard interpreted. First Interview, March 20. The King began by laying down the principles which governed his life : (1) his religion, (2) his determination to keep his name above reproach, and (3) devotion to his religion and to the interests of his subjects. He was a self-made man, having started with nothing in the world, and provided that he stuck to his principles he was prepared to go back to nothing. Times were changing, the pristine honesty of the world was declining, but he would never pursue a crooked path. He believed in consulting everyone, but no one could lead him by the nose. He would always speak to His Majesty’s Government frankly and sincerely. All sorts of stories were afloat about his subservience to the Italians, but he could assure His Majesty's Government that they were nonsense. Mr. Rendel said how much the King’s frankness was appreciated by members of the Government in Great Britain, and Sir Reader Bullard said that he was sure that the King was never suspected by His Majesty’s Government of subservience to Italy, and that His Majesty’s Government knew that his policy was directed to what was their object as well as his, viz., the maintenance of the independence of Saudi Arabia. 2. Ibn Saud said that he was a Moslem first of all, but he believed that of all the European Powers the one with whom it was to the advantage of the Arabs everywhere to be on good terms was Great Britain. After some talk on these lines Sir Reader Bullard took the opportunity to convey the thanks of His Majesty’s Government for the advice which the King had given to the Mufti of Jerusalem when the mufti appealed for his help recently (Foreign Office telegram No. 12 of the 1st March). The King expressed pleasure at this mark of appreciation of his efforts and repeated what he had said to the mufti (he had advised him to co-operate with the British in maintaining order and to await the result of the Royal Commission), and he said that he had also warned the mufti not to let himself be made an instrument for Italian intrigues. He went on to say that he wanted the whole “ bundle ” of Arab States to be on good terms with His Majesty’s Government. He was not thinking of Palestine for the moment; that question was being considered, and he trusted that a solution would be found that would be satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government, to the people of Palestine, and to the Arabs in general. No, he was thinking of danger which threatened the Arab world in two places, the l r emen, and Iraq. 3. First the Yemen. The Yemen was in a ferment. The whole country was against the heir apparent, Ahmad, while the Imam said “yes” to everyone, but did nothing. When three of the sons of the Imam came on the pilgrimage recently, Sayyid Husain spoke to the King about the situation in the Yemen and asked for his advice. If there was a revolt in the Yemen, what would be the attitude of (1) Ibn Saud, and (2) the Italians ? According to Sayyid Husain— and Ibn Saud knew it to be true—the whole population without exception hated Ahmad and the Foreign Minister, Raghib, a Turk who is in Italian pay. They had asked for the removal of Raghib, but he was protected by Ahmad. They had sent the Imam a written protest (here the King gave us a copy), but without effect. If they were free they would revolt and sweep away both Raghib and Ahmad, and the Imam too if he opposed this popular movement. 4. To this enquiry from Sayyid Husain, Ibn Saud said he had replied that, as for himself, he proposed to observe a policy of complete neutrality and non-intervention in Yemen affairs. He had withdrawn once when he might have occupied the Yemen, and he did not propose to reverse that policy. If there should be trouble in the Yemen, the most he could do would be to consult other Arab countries if asked by both sides to try to make peace, and to see what could be done to give effect to the request. As to Great Britain and Italy, Ibn Saud had told Husain about the Rome understanding of 1927, and had said that both the British and the Italians had assured him that it was their firm desire that* 3 the independence of the Yemen should be maintained. In conclusion, Ibn Saud declared vehemently that there must be an outbreak in the Yemen—perhaps before the death of the Imam. In that event, what would the Italians do and what would be the attitude of His Majesty’s Government? 5. Mr. Rendel replied that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated the dangers of the situation in the Yemen. There was no doubt that the Italians ^had been, and still are, intriguing actively in that country and would be very ready to fish in the waters they had helped to trouble. But while the internal situation was perhaps more dangerous than it had been, he was inclined, for the following reasons and speaking purely personally, to doubt whether the Italian danger was now quite as acute as it had been a year ago. In the Rome understanding of 1927 His Majesty’s Government had made it quite clear, and the Italians had formally recognised, that His Majesty’s Government regarded it as “a vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea.” (At this point Sir Reader Bullard gave King Ibn Saud, for convenience of reference, a copy of an Arabic translation of the relevant text, which had already been communicated to His Majesty by Sir Andrew Ryan.) There was, of course, no reason to trust any Italian promises as such, but it was obvious that, in view of the terms of the Rome understanding, any attempt by Italy to establish herself in the Yemen would be a direct challenge to His Majesty’s Government. No doubt Italian hotheads, possibly Italian local officials, cherished designs on the Yemen. But Italian policy would be directed from Rome, and present indications suggested that for European reasons, and in view of British rearmament, Italy was not now anxious to embark on any conflict with His Majesty’s Government, but was rather seeking to establish better relations. Even if this view should prove mistaken, he did not think King Ibn Saud need be seriously disturbed by Italian activities in the Yemen. Saudi and British interests were closely parallel, and it was difficult to see how any development which threatened Saudi independence could fail equally to threaten British interests, so that the probability was that, in any such event. Ibn Saud would, in any case, find Great Britain at his side. At a later interview the opportunity was taken to mention that the Italians themselves seemed anxious to keep the Rome understanding alive, and apparently feared a forward policy on the part of His Majesty’s Government (see Foreign Office despatch to Jedda, No. 182 of the 24th February). 6. Mr. Rendel added that he understood (from Sheikh Hafiz Wahba) that His Majesty wished to know the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards his suggestion for an exchange of information about the Yemen, &amp;c. Mr. Rendel saw no reason why this should not be possible. His Majesty’s Government would be glad to pass on to Ibn Saud any information of interest which they could properly communicate to him. though in doing this they would, of course, be assuming that Ibn Saud was satisfied that there would be no risk of leakage at the Saudi end. 7. Ibn Saud then turned to Iraq. He had good information, for people wrote to him from all parts of the Arab world and he had seen many Iraqi pilgrims, and the reports all tallied with each other. Everyone was suspicious of the new Iraqi Government and regarded it as not Arab. There had been much to be said against Yasin-al-Hashimi, who had even gone so far as to ask Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to tell Ibn Saud to beware of the British Government, but at least his policy was an Arab policy. To the policy of the present Iraqi Government there were two objections: it was communistic, and it was under Turkish inffuence. The Turks had begun by trying to get possession of the Sanjak of Alexandretta, and their next aim would be to acquire Mosul. 8. Mr. Rendel said that the title of Communist was sometimes misapplied to anyone who favoured economic social reform. He understood that such reforms were long overdue in Iraq, where there was much extreme poverty, and it was possible that Hikmet Suleiman’s legislation was necessary, and was not imposed in any spirit of communism. It might be well, therefore, to reserve judgment on this point until the Amir Saud and Sheikh Hafiz Wahba should have seen the situation for themselves during their impending visit to Bagdad. (Here Ibn Saud said that Hikmet Suleiman did not care a rap for the poor or for anyone.) As to Turkish influence. Mr. Rendel believed that, while the maker of the military cou'p d'Etat, Bakr Sidqi, and some of his military associates, might be described as pro-Turkish, Hikmet Suleiman showed signs of wanting to shake [981 m—5] b 24 himself free of military influence, and the longer he could maintain his Govern ment, the more hope there was that he would become less dependent on the army s support. As to the attitude of the Turkish Government, a year ago Mr. Rendel would have scouted the suggestion that Turkey might embark on a policy of adventure. In this opinion he had been seriously shaken by Turkey’s Alexandretta policy, but the Turks had not “got away with it” over * Alexandretta. and they had, he thought, felt themselves much isolated at Geneva and had retreated from the extreme position they had taken up. The fact that the Turks had received so marked a check over Alexandretta ought, he felt, to make them much less likely to put forward any other similar claims in future. Second Interview, March 21. 9. Ibn Saud said that he wanted to make some remarks under four heads : — (1) His relations with His Majesty’s Government. (2) The Arabs in general. (3) Palestine. (4) The future. The interview went on for over two hours, but never got beyond the head. Ibn Saud went over the whole course of his relations with His Majesty s Govern ment from the moment when he first entered into communication with them through the Political Agent at Bahrein, and suggested that their common interests demanded that the Turks should not be allowed to establish themselves strongly in the Arabian Peninsula, and received an assurance that His Majesty s Government would not allow the Turks to approach him either by sea or through Koweit. He recited his dealings with Sir Percy Cox during the war, recalled the loyalty with which he had offered to help the feherif Hussein against the Turks, and spoke of the “guarantees” which he had received from Sir Percy Cox. Nothing whatever had come of these “ guarantees, though he had been promised “all sorts of things.” He had assisted the Arab policy of His Majesty’s Government by communicating to them the written and oral offers which he received from the Turks as an inducement to him to join them against Hussein— offers which he refused, alleging that he could not move against the British because they were his neighbours on the Gulf, and saying that, in any case, he could not join the Turks when they were slaughtering Arabs. At first he even told His Majesty’s Government that he would accept Hussein as King of the Arabs, but later he was obliged to withdraw this offer. He told Hussein that the resources in money and arms which were supplied by the British were being wasted through being dealt out to the various sheikhs according to the number of followers they said they had, and asked that, if he sent his son and some men to help, they should only be given arms for themselves and food to eat, and Hussein had replied that Ibn Saud must be either mad or drunk. Ibn Saud thereupon informed the British Government that he must lay down two conditions : that he would not recognise Hussein as King of the Arabs, though he did not object to his being King of the Hejaz. and that when the war was over His Majesty’s Government should allow him to settle his own scores with Hussein. He had always listened to the advice of His Majesty’s Government, even to his own hurt. On more than one occasion he had fallen out with his chief supporters, the Ikhwan, for that reason, e.g., when he retook Turaba, which the Sherifians had unjustly occupied, and His Majesty’s Government asked him not to go any further; when he refrained at the request of His Majesty’s Government from taking Aqaba, where the ex-King Hussein was staying, and Maan; and when he listened to the mediation of the British agent at Jedda and ensured the peaceful occupation of the city to the disappointment of some of his followers. For all this loyal support, and after all the promises made to him, what had he got? Nothing whatever. On the contrary ! 10. He would put his complaints under three heads :— (a) His Majesty’s Government had not given him the help he needed. (b) Their boundary policy was always squeezing him in. (c) By their Gulf policy they tried to make him dependent commercially on Koweit and Bahrein.Whereas a friend in need of help looked to a more powerful friend to assist him, he had had no help from His Majesty's Government. Look what His Majesty’s Government had done for Egypt and Iraq ! Those countries might be richer than Saudi Arabia, but Saudi Arabia could, in his opinion, be more useful than either to His Majesty’s Government. 11. After expressing great interest in the valuable historical survey which the King had given, but pointing out that what we had to adopt as a basis was the facts of to-day, Mr. Rendel suggested that one difficulty was that, whereas countries like Egypt and Iraq, which contained rich natural resources, could be developed by commercial enterprises which would earn their own profits, Saudi Arabia did not at present appear to be economically in that category. If, how ever, Ibn Saud had any particular kind of help in mind and would specify what it was, he could be sure that the suggestion would be considered very carefully. Ibn Saud said that there were all sorts of help that he might mention, but he would speak first of aviation, to which he attached great importance. He had sent to His Majesty’s Minister through “ that man ” (pointing to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin) a suggestion about the training of Saudis in aviation in Great Britain. As to the Italians, he swore as a Moslem and an Arab that when the Italian aeroplanes arrived, he wished that Allah would destroy the machines and the men in them. Mr. Rendel reminded the King that the failure of other countries to follow our example in reducing armaments had compelled us to rearm, and that the expansion of the British air force was employing to the full all our resources for the manufacture of aeroplanes and the training of men as pilots and mechanics, and that, while this should tend to deter other nations from disturbing the peace of the world and should therefore be of advantage to His Majesty, it made it more difficult than it would otherwise have been to give His Majesty direct assistance in matters of aviation. Nevertheless, if His Majesty would make specific suggestions, they would be examined most carefully and sympathetically. 12 . The subject was again referred to at a later meeting the same day. Mr. Rendel repeated his warning about the peculiar difficulties created by the pre occupation of His Majesty’s Government with their scheme of rearmament, and spoke of the necessity for co-ordination of skilled men with suitable machines if time and money spent on training and equipment were not to be wasted, and of the possibility that Saudi Arabia, having a very small urban population among which to find men with a suitable preliminary training in mechanical work, &amp;c., might find it more difficult than, e.Q., Egypt, to produce suitable candidates for aviation work. Sir Reader Bullard suggested that, whereas it might suit the Italians to undertake the training of any number of Saudis because of the political effect it might be expected to have, His Majesty’s Government would be reluctant to embark on any scheme that would not have a reasonable chance of success. He also asked the King what His Majesty thought would be the effect upon the Italians of any close relationship between Elis Majesty’s Government and Saudi Arabia in matters of aviation. Was there any reason to think that this might encourage them to seek to extend their influence elsewhere, e.q., in the Yemen ? It was true that the Italians had themselves wished to identify themselves closely with Saudi Arabia in aviation affairs, but how far was that merely a phase of the war with Ethiopia and their hostility to His Majesty’s Government on that point? The King said that the Italians still wished to be allowed to develop Saudi aviation, and implied that he didn’t care what they thought. He added bitterly that the pilots trained.in Italy were no good. At one point in the con versation the King said that if Iraq shook itself free of Turkish influence he would not mind having some Iraqis to help in aviation later on. 13. It was arranged that Sheikh Yusuf Yasin should prepare for His Majesty’s Minister a note of the Saudi requirements in aviation matters. This note, Ibn Saud was assured, would receive the most careful attention. Third Interview, March 21. 14. The King said that he wanted to speak about his future in relation to His Majesty’s Government. He began with a long and rather pointless account of the negotiations for the Saudi-Iraq Treaty of Friendship and Alliance. In so far as it had a point it was intended to show the Iraqis as rather slippery customers. At Riyadh, said the King, Naji-al-Asil suggested to Ibn Saud that6 Iraq should deal with His Majesty’s Government in the matter of Palestine on behalf of Ibn Sand, and that Ibn Saud should deal with the Imam about his adhesion to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty. Ibn Saud had expressed surprise at this request, and had said that both States must act together in both matters. He spoke of what appeared to be a similar attempt to side-track him in the matter of securing the adhesion of the Imam to the treaty. He then spoke of the surprise he had felt at the Iraqis wanting to insert in the treaty a reference to the League of Nations, of which Saudi Arabia was not a member, and added that the Imam would never consent to sign anything in which there was a reference to the League. Mr. Rendel explained that members of the League could not assume any obligation which might be incompatible with their existing obligations under the Covenant, and that they were therefore bound to make a reservation to that effect in any treaty involving military assistance, &amp;c. Moreover, Iraq was also bound by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance, which, as His Majesty’s Government had pointed out to the Iraqi Government, involved a similar reservation on the part of Iraq. Mr. Rendel said that, of course, such a reservation would not affect a party not a member of the League, and that consequently neither Saudi Arabia nor the Yemen would be affected by such a reservation on the part of Iraq. 15. The King then said that he had often been asked whether the Arab States of the Persian Gulf could not adhere to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty. He had fended off such enquiries, alleging the unimportance of such States, but he would be glad to know the opinion of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Rendel reminded His Majesty of the position of His Majesty’s Government in the Gulf. They had had relations with the Arab rulers there in some cases for as long as a century and a half, having been compelled to take action in regard to gun-running, piracy, the slave trade, &amp;c. As a result, as had been made clear at the time of the Treaty of Jedda, the foreign affairs of Kowei t, Bahrein, Qatar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms were in the hands of His Majesty’s Government, who exercised sovereignty over them in those affairs and therefore could not allow them to enter into treaty relations with any foreign State. Ibn Saud seemed to accept this statement without demur. 16. This subject led to the question of the frontiers. Mr. Rendel repeated the arguments which he used with Sheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 19th March, saying that His Majesty’s Government had made great concessions in this respect, whereas His Majesty was holding firmly to his original demand. In the northern part of the eastern frontier there remained nothing between the parties but the Jabal Naksh and Khor-el-Odeid. with perhaps an adjustment in the Sufuk (Safaq) region that might go some way towards meeting the King’s wishes. Could not His Majesty make some concession here? It would make an excellent impression on the Foreign Office if he could. Ibn Saud repeated his familiar statement that the whole of the coast belonged to his ancestors and that the present rulers would not deny it. Koweit, for instance; all the tribes living in Koweit were really Saudi tribes. It was true that he had recognised the treaties between the coastal rulers and His Majesty’s Government in the Hadda Agreement^ 1 ) but on the question of the boundaries there was a limit beyond which he could not go. The boundary of Qatar was well known to be Araik, which was in the nufud. 17. The maps which were at hand were examined, but Araik was not marked on them. Sir Reader Bullard said that he had seen a map on which, unless his memory was at fault. Araik was shown to the south of Jabal Naksh! In that case there would no longer be any disagreement on that point. 18. As to Khor-el-Odeid, Ibn Saud said that, in claiming it for Saudi Arabia, he was thinking of the interests of His Majesty’s Government as much as of his own. for no one but himself could keep order there. When crimes were committed there it was to him that the people applied for redress. 19. The King seemed very anxious to pass on to another subject. It appeared at first that he was wanting to evade the boundary question, but when the other subject came to be broached it was found to be a question of capital importance. What, the King asked, would happen to him in the case of war? Suppose war began in Europe, or in the Yemen, or anywhere? Could not His Majesty’s Government make some treaty or some other lesser undertaking with him ? It could be secret if they wished. 20. Mr. Rendel said that any such undertaking, and more especiallv anv kind of secret guarantee, was precluded by the British constitutional system, ( 1 ) This reference should be to Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda.w 7 whidi would in any case make its eventual fulfilment uncertain. Sir R. Bullard added that His Majesty’s Government were obliged, as members of the League of Nations, to register all treaties with the League. Mr. Rendel then went on to say, as he had said the previous day, that he could hardly imagine any occasion on which a threat to Saudi Arabia would not be a threat to His Majesty’s ^ Government, and added that this community of interests was a stronger bond than many a treaty. We had given too many promises in the past, under pressure of war in particular, and could not give one in this case. Sir Reader Bullard reminded the King once more of the terms of the Rome Agreement of 1927. His Majesty s Government had recorded in writing that they regarded it as a “ vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea.” The King seemed to derive comfort from this conversation. Fourth Interview, March 22. 21. The King said that in this the last conversation before Mr. Renders departure he wished to speak about Palestine. The Arabs were now really alarmed by the Zionist policy. They feared that a Jewish Government would be established in Palestine and would include Transjordan in its scope, and they were even beginning to fear that there might be designs on Medina itself, the burial-place of the Prophet Mahomet. Some of these fears might be exaggerated, and due to irresponsible talk by individual Jews, but there was also genuine ground for apprehension, and he himself was very anxious about the question. Great Britain was powerful and could crush the Arab opposition, but he feared that there might be dangerous repercussions in other Moslem countries in which His Majesty’s Government had special interests, e.g., Egypt, Iraq and India. 1 here were many enemies watching for an opportunity to injure Great Britain. The chief of these was. of course, Italy. The attempt that Italy was making to win recognition as the friend of Moslems in general and of the Arabs in particular was well known. The Italians had used the pilgrimage for propa ganda purposes, and had done their best to induce him to speak in praise of their pro-Moslem policy. He had resisted this attempt, and he had no belief whatever in Italian professions, for he knew what had happened in Tripoli and in Abyssinia, but there was a real danger from the Italians, nevertheless, if the troubles in Palestine should flare up again. Nor were the Turks inactive. They had many agents in Palestine, who never failed to rub it into the Arabs that the result of their revolt against the Turks was subordination to the Jews. The Zionist policy, as it was being carried out at present, was contrary to British interests, and that was one reason why he was against it. As a Moslem and an Arab he naturally sympathised with the Arabs of Palestine. He had suppressed these personal feelings hitherto out of friendship for His Majesty’s Government, and he could always suppress his feelings if policy required it. But the Zionist policy was not even in the interests of Great Britain. Moreover, His Majesty’s Government must realise that he stood alone, and that he had to think of his position in a Moslem world where he was the butt of much criticism, and where many of his co-religionists would not even admit that he was a Moslem. He felt that he had come to the end of what he could do in the matter of Palestine. 22. His Majesty was assured that his views would be communicated to His Majesty’s Government without delay. 23. Ibn Sand said that he had one last question. Suppose that there was trouble in the Yemen and the Italians asked him about it, as they might very well do; what should he say ? Should he reply to this effect:— He did not propose to interfere in the internal affairs of the Yemen, and the Rome understanding of 1927, the relevant part of which had been communicated to him by the Italians as well as by the British, seemed to require them both to adopt a similar attitude of non-intervention. Mr. Rendel said that this reply seemed to meet the circumstances exactly.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). April 12, 1937. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4. [E 1964/678/91] Copy No. Sir R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—{Received April 12.) (No. 44.) Sir, Jedda, March 25, 1937. IN the summary of conversations with Ibn Saud which I had the honour to submit as an enclosure to my despatch No. 41, dated the 23rd March, the question of the Yemen was referred to in paragraphs 3. 4, 5 and 23. I now transmit a summary of the document which the King handed to me when we were dealing with this subject. The document is a multigraphed copy of a typewritten original in Arabic, in the form of an open letter to the Imam. I understood from Ibn Saud that the letter had been distributed widely in the Yemen. It urges the Imam to designate his son Husain as his successor, instead of Ahmad, and to begin now to train Husain for the task of government. There is a pan-Arab touch in the request that two Moslems from Syria, Egypt or Iraq should sit on the Council of Notables whose formation is recommended. In so far as foreign interference is referred to. it appears that the British are placed on the same level as the Italians. 2. Ibn Saud spoke with great earnestness about the certainty that trouble must break out in the Yemen on the Imam’s death, if not before. The open letter assures the Imam that a revolt will break out before his honourable coffin has reached the cemetery. The open letter might be a piece of propaganda for Husain with nothing behind it, for all I could tell, for I have little direct knowledge about the Yemen, but Ibn Saud was doubtless telling the truth when he claimed to be very well informed. He referred to the Wazir family as being with the rest of the Yemen against Ahmad. It will be remembered that Muhammad-al-Wazir came on the pilgrimage this year. He shared to some extent in the honours paid to the three sons of the Imam by Ibn Saud. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to Cairo and Aden. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. Enclosure. Summary of the Contents of an Open Letter addressed to the Imam Yahya and signed “ The Loyal Tongue of the Nation.” THE Imam’s rule has been partly good and partly bad, but his piety has caused, and still causes, his people to overlook the bad things and to be loyal to him and to his house. However, times are changing and men with them, so he would be well advised to listen to frankly uttered counsels. He wishes his son Ahmad to succeed him. Such a succession would be disastrous, for Ahmad is incapable of governing; in such an event the people would be dissatisfied, and, on the death of the Imam Yahya, they would rise in armed revolt. The agreements entered into with England and Italy, with a view to strengthening Ahmad’s position, would prove valueless. The writer then advises the Imam as follows :— (1) To consult the Amirs, Ministers and officials as to the man they consider a suitable successor to the Imamate. It does not follow, of course, that they will speak their minds freely. (2) To proclaim A1 Husain as his successor and initiate him, in the Imam’s lifetime, into the work of government with the assistance of a council of notables. Among the members of such a council should be two Moslem leaders or upright men from Syria, Egypt or Iraq. This would be welcome to the people who consider A1 Husain an honest and pious man, and would mean the frustration of foreign designs. [981 m—4](3) To persuade Ahmad to surrender his rights for the common weal and recompense him by giving him the Amirate of Hejah, with the revenues thereof, on condition that he takes his orders from the capital. (4) To promote unity among his sons and send some of them to Egypt to be educated at A1 Azhar or some other institution, under the supervision of tutors appointed by him and by the Egyptian Government. Haste is urged in putting these suggestions into execution, and the Imam is told that his adherence to the Saudi-Iraq Treaty will strengthen the Yemen; thus there is no need to fear foreigners. The importance of his recognising A1 Husain during his lifetime is stressed once again, as is the importance of A1 Husain’s travelling in Egypt, Syria and Iraq in order that he may see how foreign countries are ruled.(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIIAHNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERKMENT).

THE above-mentioned delegates have, under instructions from their respective Governments, discusseu certain Questions regarding British and Italian interests in Southern Arabia and the Red Sea. The delegates, acting under their instructions that the respective policies of the two Governments in SouthernArabia and the Red Sea should he pursued in a spirit of friendly co-operation and developed on parallel though independent lines, have reached the conclusion that their Governments are in agreement on the following points 1 0 That it is in the common interest of the two Governments to pursue a policy of pacification in order to avoid so far as possible conflicts between the various Arab chiefs. 2 e That such influence as the two Governments may be in a position to exercise respectively with Ibn Saud, the Imam Yahia and the Idrisi of Asir, should be directed towards eliminating causes of conflict in order to arrive, if possible, at pacific and friendly settlements between those chiefs, 3. That while continuing to exert their influence in the cause of peace, the two Governments should not intervene in any conflict, which, despite the efforts of the two Governments tov/ards pacification, may break out between those chiefs. 4, That the guiding principle in British policy in the Red Sea is the security of imperial communications with India and the East. For this purpose His Britannic Majesty’s Government regard it as a vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea, and more particularly on Kamaran or the Farsan Islands, and that neither Kamaran nor the Farsan Islands shall fall into the hands of an unfriendly Arab ruler. That, on the other hand, it is the interest of Italy, in view of her possessions on the western coast of the Red Sea, that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea, or on Kamaran or the Farsan Islands, and that neither Kamaran nor the Farsan Islands should fall into the lianas of an unfriendly Arab ruler.5. That there should he economic and commercial freedom on the Arahian coast and the islands oi the Red ooa for citizens and subjects of the two countries and that the protection which such citizens and subjects may legitimately expect from their respective Governments should not assume a political character or complexion^ 6, That the presence of British officials at Kamaran is solely for the purpose of securing the sanitary service o± the pilgrimage to Mecca, but that for administrative reasons His Britannic Majesty 1 s Government do not consider it possible at present to agree to the Italian request for the participation of an Italian doctor in the quarantine service. But since the Italian Government maintain their point of view in this matter, His Britannic Majesty*s Government are disposed to reconsider the question when the number of pilgrims originating in Italian colonies or possessions increases to such an extent as better to justify the presence of an Icalian doctor, 7, That it is in the common interest oi the two Governments to use their respective influence with the Arab chiefs in such a manner as to safeguard as lar as may be possible the mutual interests of Italy and Great Britain, and that, therefore, it is desirable that the two Governments should maintain close touch with each other in all questions affecting the Red Sea and Southern Arabia, in order to avoid misunderstandings between them or misapprehension on the part of the Arab chiefs in regard to the policies ».hich the two Governments intend to follow in the above-mentioned areas, RONALD GRAHAM.

I HAVE the honour to inform you that l have read with great interest the copies of the despatches from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Cairo, Nos. 1385 of the 18th December last, and 223 of the 18th February, regarding Italian policy on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. 2. The appreciation of Italian aims in this quarter formulated by Sir Miles Lampson agrees in general with the views submitted to Mr. Rendel in a private letter from Mr. Ingram on the 16th February last; that is to say, that while it is not the immediate aim of Italian policy directly and openly to interfere on the Arabian shores of the Red Sea, efforts will be made to increase Italian influence and prestige in that area in the hope that it may ultimately perhaps be unnecessary for Italy to take any overt action to secure her purpose or, at least, that if such action is necessary it may be taken at a moment and under conditions favourable to Italy. 3. If it is considered that this Italian policy calls for energetic and strong resistance on our side, there might perhaps be some advantage in stating publicly and clearly that we, for our part, are determined to abide by the spirit and the letter of the Anglo-Italian Agreement of 1927 in regard to this question, that we attach the greatest importance to its full observance, and that the Italian Government have informed us that this is equally their policy. 1 see no reason why the Italian Government should take exception to such a declaration, though, of course, the actual phrasing would require very careful consideration ; indeed, in the light of the conversation reported in your despatcli No. 182 of the 24th February, 1 believe that they might on the contrary rather welcome it. Italian character being what it is, the Fascist Government no doubt suspect us of intrigues no less subtle than their own; they are, of course, aware of the friendly relations existing between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Sand, and they are perhaps afraid that we may support Ibn Baud in a forward policy in the Yemen before they have had time to mature their plans. 4. The question arises of the opportune moment for such a declaration ; I assume that it would be done by way of a question and answer in the House of Commons as suggested by Sir Miles Lampson. I think on the whole that it would be best that it should be made at a comparatively early date, so that it could in a sense be linked up with the demarche made by Signor Crolla as reported in your despatch No. 182. It is true that relations between Italy and the United Kingdom are not at this moment too happy, and that perhaps later in the year the atmosphere will have improved. If, however, we wait till then, the declaration might have the appearance of being somewhat uncalled for, and therefore awake suspicion, while if it is made soon the Italian Government could hardly feel any resentment, since it could be represented to them that His Majesty’s Government considered after Signor Crolla’s statements that it was an announcement which could not but give pleasure to the Italian Government. 5. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives at Cairo, Bagdad and Jedda. I have, &amp;c. ERIC DRUMMOND.

Terhis of referenoe . In accordance with Conclusion (a) of the 48th faceting of the Middle East (Official) ~ub CoiniTiittee ^ we have been esited by the Foreign Office to report, from the strategic point of view, on the importance of the -emen So an Imperial interest. This question h s arisen in connection with reports of Itali: n political activity in the Yemen. The Yemen in relation to In roerial security. In this prper we confine ourselves to examining the possible effect of Italian penetration in the Yemen uoon our strategic situation. We h ave not dealt either with the economic consequences of Italian influence or with its effect on our prestige. In a recent paper* we emphasised that 'our sea ana air communications passing through the Mediterranean to Africa, India, the Err East, Australia and New Zealand are of prime importance in our imperial organisation. The British Empire cannot afford to allow any extension of Italian power which would further imp-ir | our security in this area, our control of the Suez Garni and its accroaches or our prestige in the Middle East.' The Yemen derives its strategic importance from the possibility of the exploitati ,n of its position in relation to our sea and air communications I and the approaches to the ouez Canal to which we referred m this quotation. Moreover, the Red Sea is the only alternative s*a paper No c C o 0 o Se 491 £ -1- Hiroute to Lrypt in the event of war with Italy. rh The Red oea is our direct route to the Par East and the use of Kaiuaran Bay would become specially important to us if we re at ^ ar a^inst Jap^n. he should not therefore wish Italy to ac' uire a degree of influence in the Yemen which would enaolo her to create obstacles to our use oi '-.aiaaran 3 . Kamaran Island has been in British hands since 1915 but under the Rome Agreement of 19 7 we are precluded from erecting defences or introducing a military garrison in time of peace. It seems possible that if Italy exercised a strong influence m the Yemen she might pr.v-il upon a pro-Italian Immn to agitate for our withdrawal&gt; with the result that we might be unsole to rely on the use of Kamaran Bay. 4, Our sea c oi.ununieditions I . ta ^ Eecur iJx ag;a in st nav i a t tggck. If we were at war against Italy, it is unlikely that she would have any considerable surface naval forces in the ned ceex* Our ability to control the passage of ships through the buez Canal in time of war would make it impossible for Italy to increase the nav 1 strength she had in the Red Sea at the outbreak of war, £n d in these circ’-mstances she could not hope to maintain surface. v is e is for long, once we were able to detach naval forces to de 1 with them. She might hope to maintain submarine forces for a longer period, although, unless we were heavily involved elsewhere we should be able to detach adequate forces to urotect our ship^ing against them. For her submarines a base at Ifassawa would be both more secure and more convenient than any base which might be developed on the Yemen coast. It there.ore seems unlikely that Italy would grin any material advantage by attempting to develop a naval base of any sort on the Yemen coast.-3- Whatever the situation in the Yeuien 3 we may thus expect to he ..rhle to deal with the uurely n r v-1 threat which 11' - ly could develop and to use the Red Sea as a route t or shinning * nrovidea that we could give adequate protection ‘g-inst air attack. 5. o ecurity ap - ' inst air a 11ack. -Ithougii the Italians 1 ready posses:, air h-ses in Eritrea from which their aircraft will he able in future to reach almost any part of the Red cea ? the danger from air attack would he greatest near the southern exit froiti the Red Sea. Between Xamaran Island and Aden 9 a distance of some 300 miles 9 our convoys 9 even if they followed the east coast * woul ■. h ,ve to pa c e Italian air bases in Eritrea at distances varying from only 50 to 150 miles. In the ii.imeaiate futures, and so long as our forces remain equipped with short range bombers* the strength of our counter attacks against It' lion air bases vould be mr teriaily increased if we could make use sf Xamaran Island* and possibly landing grounds in the Yemen co stsl plain in a dition to operating direct from the Sudan and Aden. On Xamaran Island there is a landing ground in regular use by the Royal mir Force and* provided that we had adequate n?vel forces in the Red Sea* and Italian influence in the Yemen was slight* we ought to have no great difficulty in retaining ths irlrnd. Assuming* therefore* that in war our air forces in that are: coul i be adequately increased* our ability to concentrate an air counter-offensive froiu all sides* combines with the di ficulty which Italy would experience in maintaining technical supplies* should give us a considerable advantage in air warfare. This* in conjunction with the effect of / . gun fire shoul l provide adequate protection for our shinping in the Red Sea after the initial phase.-4- V —* 6. ihe situation would be ustfriclly altered if Italy ^controlled t’re Yemen. There would he little to prevent the capture of Kamarm Island, which is undefended and only 4 mij.es frol , the mainland, and even without the construction of aerodromes in peace, the Italians, with the co-operation of tne inh,-.hi .ants, could ruic'ily develop air bases in the coastal belt after the outbreak of war. Our shipping would then have to pass even closer to potential sources of air attack and we should be less favourably pieced for the development of our counter offensive. It is, therefore, clear that if Italian influence in the Yemen secured for them air facilities in Kama ran or on the mainland, 4 - ^+Vw=&gt;r&gt;rn c-p hn^e to use a it would ~&gt;lace which v/e ourselves ini&amp;ht otherwise no j; ? us at a disadvantage. 7. Pni i'i T'~' af Br-b-el-Mandeb. The Straits of Bab-el-M ndeh are only tO miles wide and coast defence guns, if mounted on both shores, could command the whole width of the Straits; and at this point Italy already owns part of the western coast. In 1S35, when the Imam of the Yemen was having a fort rebuilt at Sheikh Sa’id on the Yemen shore of the Straits, rumours of Italian interest in this strategic point were current, .or Italy to construct batteries of heavy coast defence guns on both sides of the Straits of Bat-el-Kandeb may seem a remote possibility. At the same time it should not be ignored, long as Italy controls the territory on only one side of the b traits, coast defence guns would give her only a limited - ^ advantage. If ever she controlled the territory on both sides, she might be strongly tempted to establish heavy guns on both shores.V 3. Air coirmin icati ons . The air route from Egypt down the Red Sec and along the southern coast of Arabia is vitally important to us as an alternative route to India 5 should the Baghdad route ever be denied to us. On this route we use an intermediate 1-nding ground in Tamaran Island and 9 as ''e n-ve already seen, this island might easily he made untenable if the Yemen were under the control of ^n unfriendly Power. The importance to us of a p rticular land.ine&gt; ound diminishes as the range of airercaft increasesbut it will always be preferable that our air communications should pass over friendly territory. On these grounds Italian influence m the Yemen would be prejudicial to our interests. 9. ..mien. Our naval forces operating in the Red Sea would normally be based on a.den. In war against Italy the : den Protectorate would h-ve an -dditional importance as a British air base 5 against which the Italians if confined to the African shore of the Red Sea could not make any land attack. The Aden Protectorate h'S a. coamon land frontier with the Yemen which would cause us little anxiety in war so long as a militarily weak Arab regime continues. Disputes in connection with the Yemen frontier were settled by our treaty m 1954- and as a consequence we have been able to restrict ourselves to occupying such portions of the Protectorate as are essential to the security of the naval base. Even a moderate degree of Italian political penetration of the Yemen 9 if b'eked by money* might encourage the Imam or his successor to re-open the disputes and we should then h ve to expect a recrudescence of frontier raids.\ If Italy were able to in such influence in the Yemen s v’ould eneble her to organise serious land attacks against the Aden Protectorate it v r ould constitute an entirely new threat to the security of Aden. 1'\ The possibility of land attack on a serious scale would depend on the attitude and martial qualities of the Yemeni population r nd on communications both to •''nd within the Ye-pen. The best fighting material in the Imam’s army is the hill tribesman but it is doubtful whether he would prove adaptable to military organisation on European lines or preserve his martial qualities i. called on to fight elsewhere than among his native hills. The vlue of the Inara’s army 5 which is at present some YO 5,000 strong is doubtful an in 1904- it failed to put up any serious o'~'position to the V/ahabis in the plains. If 5 however 5 at some future date Italy established her influence in the Yemen to an extent which enabled her to introduce a military mission to organise the Yemeni forces and to back them up by Italian specialists our situation at Aden would be radically altered. In smite of the limited road coiomunications leading from the Yemen to the Aden Protectorate 5 the vulnerability of Italian coi.imunications across the Red Sea and the small capacity of the Yemen harbours 5 a considerable garrison of all arms would be necessary to make Aden sec-Te. 11. Developments by Towers other than Italy . The present orientation of international interests in the Red Sea makes it unlikely that any European Power other than Italy will attempt to establish influence in the Yemen. We have therefore only considered Italian penetration. There remains the possibility -6V si that Itm Gaud try to absorb the Yemen in preference to accepting the continued risk of the growth of Italian influence. Prom r purely military point of view the danger th t Ibn Sand would develop the strategic potentialities of the Yemen to our disadvantage is remote, and control of the country by him would be infinitely preferable to control by Italy. £UI iLAKY . ( 3 ) The Yemen derives its strategic importance from the possibility of the exploitation of its position in ation to our sea and air communications through the Red bea * In a ' dltion t0 its i‘»lortynce as part of the through route via the mediterranean and the fcues Canal, the Red Sea is the only alternative sea route to Egypt in the event of war with Italy.

(c) If we were at war against Italy the full use of K'maran and the Yemen coast would be ~n important asset in our air measures for the protection of our shinping. jfv on tne other hand, Italy was able to use Kamaran and to develop other air bases in the Yemen the protection of our shipping in the Red oea would be made much more difficult. (d) The possibility that the Straits of Bab-el- f.iandeb might be commanded by coast defence guns mounted on coth shores makes it strategically important that Italy should not gain control of the Sheikh Sa’id area. -7-over (e) Our alternative air route to the E'st p- sses the Yemen and it ie consequently important that this area should not he in the hands of any major foreign Pov/er. (f) The Yemen is a potential L se for l^nd operations agrins t the den Protectorate. (g) Even a moderate scale of Italian influence in the Yemen might 9 in v/ar 9 enable them to get possession of K iiiaran and develop air bases in the coastal belt* The Italians would need to establish a much more extensive influence in the country before they could either instal guns to command the Straits or instig te land attacks on a serious scale gainst the Protectorate; but taking a long view these possibilities should not be ignored. (h) It is to our strategic interest that neither the Y&gt;.iiCn nor any part of it should be allowed to fall under the control of Italy. (Signed) ERNES CHATFIELD 0 M E. L 0 ELLINGTON. ' C.J.

Rumours have for some time been current at Hodaidah and Kamaran that Italian 7arehip had visited Island to the north of the latter and had landed a party at Baklan Small island about 20 miles West Medi* Administrator of kamaran sent observer to investigate and reported on loth May that the rumours wore without foundation. Naval reports fro» Port Sudan now state that small Italian men-of~war have landed personnel at Peeht Island. Italian occupation of any island in this vicinity would presumably constitute breach of Clauee of the Rome conversations of 1927, and in view of persistent reports and of ruraoura of contemplated Italian intervention In Yemen in the event of disputed Succession or of Tihama revolt against Sanaa Government I suggest visit by His Majesty’s Ship to the waters between Kamaran end Parsan to obtain further information and to indicate that His Majesty’s Government are watching the situation.Mo.122.

X raise the point merely for the pur oee of elucidation since the sentence in question is capable of the meaning that Hia rajesty*s Govern ment are prepared to maintain the independence and integrity of the two Arab states in question as against each other - an attitude which would involve a departure from the principle underlying clause 3 of the ome Understanding. 3.

(E 784/27/91) 'FOREIGN OFFICE, 3.V. 1 • ! 24th February, 1937. Sir The Counsellor of the Italian Embassy called here on the 3rd February in order to discuss Anglo-Italian relations in the Red Sea area. He said that the Italian Government had been rendered uneasy at the recent journeys of Captain Seager (the British frontier officer on the Aden-Yemeni frontier) from Aden to Sana’a, and of Mr. Philby to the Hadramaut. Signor Crolla seemed rather confused about these journeys and at times spoke of Mr. Philby’s journeys to the coast of the Persian Gulf where, as vas explained to him, Mr. philby had not been for many years. But it appeared that the reference to these journeys was merely intended to introduce the subject, and that the real object of his visit was to say that Italy relied entirely on and held firmly to the Rome understanding of 1927, and to express the hope that His Majesty’s Government themselves were prepared to continue equally to base themselves on that instrument. 2. Signor Crolla was told in reply that it must be self-evident that His Majesty’s Government could have no ambitions in the Arabian peninsula and no wish to increase their responsibilities by adopting any kind of forward policy beyond the areas already under their sovereignty or protection. Their policy, as the Italian Government must know, was the maintenance of the status quo . 3. As regards the journeys to which Signor Crolla had particularly alluded. Captain Saeger was, as the Italian Government were aware, the British frontier officer on His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir Eric Drummond, G. C.M.G. , C. B. , etc., etc., etc., Rome. thethe Aden-Yemeni frontier. His Majesty’s Government had no representatives in the Yemen, hut the fact that they had a common frontier with that country naturally led to the necessity for discussing various frontier questions of common interest. In the circumstances it seemed entirely natural that Captain Seager should go to Sana’a from time to time, in the ordinary course of his \.ork as a frontier officer, in order to keep in contact with the Yemeni officials. As regards Mr. Philhy, it was no doubt universally believed abroad that he was a British agent, but it must be sufficiently obvious that such activities as his recent incursion into the Aden Protectorate were hardly those of a British agent. Signor Crolla was then given a brief account of Mr. philby’s career, and told that the Italian Government should not be misled by the ridiculous reports to which Mr. Philby’s adventures inevitably gave rise. He eventually said that the Italian Government were under no misapprehension on this point and did not take Mr. Philby seriously. He did not explain, however, why he had referred to him at the outset of the conversation. 4. Signor Crolla was then told that, while it seemed fairly clear that His Majesty’s Government could have no conceivable object in attempting to extend their responsibilities in Arabia, the position was not so simple as regards Italy. Italy made no secret of having embarked on a forward policy and whatever the attitude of the authorities in Rome might be, it could not be denied that there had been a great deal of loose talk in local Italian military and naval circles about the obvious strategic advantages which Italy might obtain if she secured a foothold in the Yemen. It was no doubt unnecessary to attach excessive importance to such remarks, but this kind of talk had unquestionably created a • • •a great deal of uneasiness in certain quarters. 5. Signor Crolla said that any such uneasiness v/as entirely unjustified. Italy had her hands more than full in Abyssinia, and the last thing she wanted was an Arabian adventure. In any case, her policy v/as to adhere firmly to the undertakings of the Rome understanding of 1927, and he wished to give a formal and categorical assurance to this effect. The Italian Government for their part had, he repeated, certainly felt some uneasiness at Captain Seager’s journey. There had been reports to the effect that he had discussed with the Imam the possible cession or lease of certain points on the Red Sea coast. These rumours, though they were unconfirmed, had given rise to much suspicion as to the attitude of His Majesty*s Government. Signor Crolla was told that these stories were entirely ridiculous. It was just as much to the interest of His Majesty’s Government as to that of Italy to adhere strictly to the undertakings contained in the Rome understanding. The last thing which His Majesty’s Government could have contemplated was to have attempted, in violation of those undertakings, to obtain any cession or lease of this sort from the Imam, even if there had been any prospect of the Imam considering such suggestions. In any case, Signor Crolla could regard what was being said to him as a formal assurance that nothing of the sort had ever been contemplated, and that such action would be entirely contrary to the basic principles of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in Arabia, which were the strict maintenance of the independence and integrity of the two Arabian States, that is to say of Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. Signor Crolla, after expressing appreciation of this assurance, said that he felt that the detente in Anglo-Italian relations ought to be extended • • •\ extended to the Middle East as v/ell, and that he would like to see the Rome understanding of 1927 developed. He was given no encouragement to pursue this line, hut he went on to explain that the Italian Government attached importance to the observance of the provisions in the Rome understanding for Anglo-Italian consultation. 6.

Sir, 17ith reference to Conclusion (e) of the 48th meeting of the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, held on the 14th December 1936, by which the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office are invited to pursue the question of British Consular representation in the Yemen, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to state that, as the result of a careful examination of this proposal in the Foreign Office, a number of serious objections have become apparent. 2, In the first place, were the King of the Yemen to admit British Consular representation he would not be able to refuse the same treatment to the Italian Government. It seems more than probable that the result would be a race in v/hich each Government would strive to outstrip the other in the size and influence of its Consular establishments, and that His Majesty’s Government would either have to meet the expense involved in maintaining a more imposing establishment than the Italian Government or stand by and see the Italian Government acquire precisely that position which it is desired to prevent them from acquiring. 3. But in any case the recent refusal of the Imam as reported by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad in his despatch ^No.616 of the 31st December last (a copy of which was sent to you in the Foreign Office letter, E 362/34/93 of the 4th February), to consent to the establishment of an Iraqi Diplomatic Miasion either at Hodeida or Sanaa suggests that it is most unlikely/ The Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office,unlikely that he would agree to the establishment in his country of British Consular offices. Even if he were to give his consent, it would probably be long before a Consul, on whose doings a fierce light v/ould from the start be directed, could live down the suspicion, with which he v/ould be regarded and evolve an alternative system of intelligence and reporting of equal efficiency to that by means of which the Residency at Aden at present obtains information regarding events in the Yemen. 4. In the second place the establishment of Consular representation in the Yemen presents difficulties from an administrative point of view, since the climate and living conditions are such that special conditions of service would be necessary, v/hile the fact that frequent changes of officers would be inevitable v/ould be likely to detract from the satisfactory performance of the difficult duties which the officers would have to carry out if the post were to have any value at all. considers that it would, in present circumstances, be preferable not to pursue the suggestion further and would be glad to learn whether hr. Ormsby Gore is in agreement with this view. In view of the foregoing considerations Lord Halifax Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, India Office and Treasury. I am. Sir, Your obedient ServantNo. 81. FOREIGN OFFIGS, S.V/.l. (F 8029/2617/91) 25th January, 1937. Secret. Sir I have read wi s Secret despatch Ho. 1385 (820/4/36) of the 18th December regarding the question of Italian activities in the Yemen. I am fully alive to the most disquieting features of the situation discussed in your despatch and the nuestion of the policy of His Majesty’s Government in this matter is forming the subject of consideration in the Middle Fast Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence^ 2. In the meantime, while I do not wish to minimise the dangers of the position, there are certain considerations which suggest that the Italian Government may not be so firmly determined on a policy of intensive penetration in the Yemen as has sometimes been suggested. I-shall welcome an early expression of your views c&gt;n the following considerations. 3. In the first place, as you are aware, the Italian Government have virtually undertaken in the Rome understanding with His Majesty’s Government of 1927 not to establish themselves at any point cn the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. I realise that it would be unwise to place too much reliance on such an undertaking on the part of the Italian Government but it should be noted that it is accompanied by a corresponding virtual undertaking on the part of His Majesty's Government/ His Excellency Sir Miles Lampson, K.C.M.G., C.3., etc., etc., etc. Cairo.Government that they also will not establish themselves on any point of the Arabian coast of the Red Sea; and that the Italian Government have in the past shown that they attach great importance to this undertaking to which they have frequently appealed. The view has more than once been expressed that one of the many motives inspiring Italian policy to-day is a fear that His Majesty’s Government may themselves be aiming at some extension of their territorial or political influence in Arabia. Such a fear is unfounded, but to the Italian mind it may appear to possess some reality, and it cannot, therefore, be entirely excluded in considering Italian policy in this area. The Italians no doubt realise that if they were violate the Rome understanding of 1927 they would thereby free His Majesty’s Government from any obligation under that understanding. They would thus enable His Majesty’s Government to occupy any area they desired in the Yemen such as, for example, Sheikh Said or the hinterland in the neighbourhood of the Aden Protectorate frontier near Tai* (where indeed British control might be welcomed). Moreover, they would justify His Majesty’s Government in entering into closer and more intimate relations with King Ibn Saud. 4. No doubt Italian local authorities in Africa and officers of the Italian Army, Navy and Air Force - looking at this question from the purely military, naval or air point of view - are anxious to secure for themselves a position of predominant influence in the Yemen. But in view of the considerations urged above it is questionable whether the Italian Government in Rome, who are fully aware of the magnitude *f their task in Abyssinia and of the risks/risks involved in any new adventure in Arabia, are as eager as the Italian fighting services to pursue a definitely aggressive policy on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. 5. The above considerations are not conclusive, but they deserve to be taken into account in any appreciation of the situation. In addition te your observations on them, I desire to learn your views on the whole question of Italian activities in Arabia in the light of euch bearing as, in your opinion, the conclusion *f the Anglo-Egyp^ian alliance has upon it. 6.

YET^N, I had a further talk this evening with Mr. Hope Gill who has recently ‘been in the Yemen on his way Lack from Abyssinia. It will be remembered that, largely as a result of an earlier talk I had with him, the question of the future policy of Eis Majesty’s Government in this part of Arabia was considered at a meeting of the Middle East(Official) Sub-Committee on 16th December, (see minutes in E.7835/2617/91 of 1935), Hut on that occasion it was a-ssumed thao the moment oi acute aanger would probably only occur on the death of the Imam and that the Italians would be unlikely to make a really dangerous political move until then. 2. Mr. Hope Gill does not quite share this view. He agrees that the Italian Government is likely to decide its main lines of policy in the light of the European situation and that Anglo-Italian relations will probably turn rather on European than on Arab considerations* But he has been very much impressed by the determination with which local Italian military, naval and air authorities are pursuing the objective of the establishment of an Italian foothold in the Yemen and he feels that it is by no means impossible that these authorities should at any moment and without waiting for the Imam to die,- stage some incident which would give them an excuse for intervention and make it impossible for the Italian Government to repudiate their action or draw back from the adventure v/ithout grave less of prestige. YThat I gather he contemplates is that the local Italian authorities should arrange for the murder of some Italian subject or protected person and should follow this ud with an immediate landing* No doubt the incidentcould 'be worked up somewhat on the lines of the famous incident at Coyfu. 3. Mr. Hope Gill is also much disturbed at the acute division between the Zeidis of the hignla.nds and the Shafais of the coastal plain in the Yemen. He thinks it ver 3 ^ possible that long before the Imam’s death the intense rivalry of these two sections 01 tne population oj- g~±g Yemen v/ill break out into open civil, war in which the Italians might well find an opportunity of intervening. They are at present apparently subsidising both parties and particularly the Zeidis* but are probably stimulating their mutual hostility. The Shafais would have no difficulty in finding capable leaders against tne Imam. j^. o Mr. Hone Gill took the vi ew tna.t one only way in wnich the Italians could be deterred from embarking on some adventure in the Yemen would be by receiving a cl^ar warning that if they did so His Majesty’s Government would take drastic counter measures or retaliatory accion. e agreed that it would not do to make any threat which we could not carry out or which might lead to an ouborean ox wider hostilities. jxut it occurred ^o us trat it might never— the less be possible to find some local means oi rei&gt;aliacion in connection with Anglo-Italian relations in East Africa which could be used as an effective threat. 5 a t think this conversation shows that the Middle East (Official!) Sub-Committee on 16th December (E.7855) did not go Quite far enough in its discussion oi this cities bion* and tx-at it will be necessary to consider the possibilities of the situation further in the light of Hr. Hope Gill’s remarks* Mr. Hope Gill has also seen Sir C. Parkinson, who, I understand, is very uneasy at the situation. 6. Query: in the first instance discuss orally with Sir C. Parkinson with a view to recommending further action. (Signed) G.7/. IMHDEL.No.1385 2. THE RESIDENCY, (8^0/4/56) CAIRO. (E 80^9/0617/91) 18th December, 1936. Sir, Since my despatch No.1383 of 17th December was written I have received your despatch No.1155 (E 7344/S617/91) enclosing a record of a conversation between the Saudi Minister in London and Nr. Rendel on 23rd November, 2. I have read this report with especial interest seeing that it very much bears out the train of ideas elaborated in my despatch under reference. The information in King Ibn Saud’s possession clearly confirms what we have heard from other independent sources ? namely an intensification of Italian intrigue in the Yemen. 3. I have never disguised the extreme gravity with which I view the situation that is apparently now developing. At great pains we have been elaborating with Egypt arrange ments for the safeguarding of the Suez Canal as an essential link in our Imperial Communications. I trust I am in error in fearing that those communications risk being blocked by Italy at the other (southern) end of the Red Sea. 4. Viewed from that angle, the present overture of King Ibn Saud through his I inister as recorded in Mr.Rendel f s note strikes me as being of the highest potential importance: and I most earnestly trust that it be not lightly turned down or ignored. Ibn Saud, who is a particularly powerful character and the dominant factor in Arab politics today, is doubtless acting mainly through motives of self-interest: so indeed are we. But it seems to me clear from what the The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, K.C. ,i ,r .D. , etc. ? etc., etc.Saudi Minister said that Ibn Saud fears that the Italians, having gained the domination - if not indeed the annexation of -the Yemen will next turn their attention to the neighbouring Hedjaz and other contiguous Saudi territory. Clearly it is one thing to have the Imam as a neighbour: it is quite another to have the Italians. 5. I have long felt convinced that we are approaching the parting of the ways with Italy, who, having annexed Abyssinia was certain sooner or later - and probably sooner rather than later - to try to do the same thing across the Red Sea in the Yemen. I am more convinced than ever that that is her aim and ambition. If I am correct - and I believe I am - there seem to me only two alternatives: (a) some arrangement with Italy that will definitely check her expansion at the Southern end of the Red Sea and prevent this threat to our interests; (b) a trial of strength with Great Britain to ensure that such expansion does not take place. 6. I arn well aware of the present conversations between London and Rome with a view to a 'detente'' in our relations. And I trust I may not he considered out of order or an alarmist if, nonetheless, I formally record my doubt whether any understanding with Italy in her present mood of cocksureness is going to achieve what we want, or put an end to the growing threat to the safety of our communications at the Southern end of the Red Sea, coupled with the safety of Perim and our possession of Aden. 7. i am sending copies of this despatch to His hajesty s Minister at Jedda,to the Chief Commissioner and Resident and Commander-in-Chief, Aden, and to the Governor-General of the Sudan.

Although the now famous Maffey Report found there was little to fear from an occupation of Abyssinia by Italy, the views of Europeans, Arabs and Somalis in the Red So* area appears to be that the conflict between Italy and Great Britain is all but certain to break out within the next few years. They only differ on the subject of time: when it will become impossible for Great Britain to acquiesce further in their lines of communications to Egypt and the Eastern Mediterranean and their territories in Africa and Arabia being threatened by the Black Army of Italy. In 1^35 Italy prepared for a war against the Abyssinians, they say; in 1939 or 1940 she will prepare for a war against British territories, possibly when Britain is already engaged in the Far East or in Europe. 18. Points of interest which arose in conversations may be summarised as follows (a) Although the King of the Yemen is anti-Italian, he is old, his Prime Minister is strongly pro-Italian and the' King’s son is being educated at ASMARA by the Italians. (b) A great deal of pro-Italian propaganda is going on in the Yemen and considerable suras of money are being spent by the Italian in this territory. (c) Two Battalions of Yemen troops have been formed as part of the Italian Army of Abyssinia. ' IT (d) A number of Somali Battalions are also being formed. Recruits are being paid 300 lira a month. It is reoorted that this pay is attracting even British Somali seamen: out of 45 told recently to report only 2 came forward. (e) Imports into Abyssinia are being confined to Italian products and manufactures. British goods are being refused entry. The economic position of Italy and her Colonies makes such action necessary. (f) The Italian troops are discontented and the majority are to be repatriated. The future Italian Arrqy in Abyssinia is to consist of 40,000 Italian and 160,000 black troops. With this Army it is not thought that Italy will find it difficult to subjugate the country. Their , f^ightfulne88 , against the black population is likely, as in LIBYA, to have the desired effect. (g) Great Britain....COK^ID^KTIaL (g) Great Britain has ’lost face* greatly in the whole native area of North Jast Africa ant Arabia. The people are not interested in what is said, but in what happens, anc Italy has seized Abyssinia desoite the opposition of Great Britain. ^ view anpears to be held generally that Great Britain is only too prone to believe the unfriendly actions ana statements of a foreign power to be bluff.

These two subjects are not the direct concern of this Office, but the first is ot general interest m view of its bearing upon the safety of communications with India - though of course it is not comparable in importance with Egypt and the Canal. The meeting was called with the idea of discussing the question of endeavouring to obtain from the Italians (in connection with the Mediterranean detente) some undertaking in regard to the Yemen, whose strategic position at the southern entrance to the Red Sea is of course important. Such an undertaking might be based on the Rome Understanding of 1927 (of which a copy is flagged m the bound volume below). The Conclusions of the meeting are on pages/ v 4136b 1000 10.35pages 10 and 11 of the Minutes now submitted. It will be seen that the general feeling was in favour of counter balancing any peaceful Italian penetration by peaceful nenetration on our own account (e.g., by broadcasting, etc.) rather than endeavouringto secure any further undertaking from the Italians - which would in any case be difficult to draft or to enforce. The discussion about the Aden protectorate amounted to very little. The conclusion is on page 15, and is m favour of a 'forward policy' which will make it difficult for Ibn Saud to encroach on Protectorate territory (Mr. Philby has been wandering It is understood that in the course of the recent conversations at Rome we have obtained Count Ciano’s promise to discuss Arabia in a friendly spirit, if this atsome future time becomes necessary.

Telegram No. 97 from the Resident at Aden, 10th December, 1936. (Paper No. M.E.(O) 210.) THE CHAIRMAN read extracts from a despatch, dated 12th December, 1335, from the Colonial Office to the Resident at Aden on the subject of relations between His Majesty’s Government and the King of the Yemen, as laid down at that date® He drew special attention to the fact that in the Anglo-Italian conversations at Rome in 1927 it was recorded that His Majesty’s Government regarded it as a vital Imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea. MR. RSNDEL remarked that this despatch had been prepared as a result of one of the previous meetings of the Sub-Committeeo But the position had now somewhat deterior ated and the Foreign Office were uneasy at the recent increase in Italian activities in the Yemen and at the uncertainty of the future in the event of the death or disappearance of the Imam. It had been suggested by His -1-- 2 - V 0 &lt;3&gt; Majesty’s Atnbassador at Ror.ie&gt; and in other quarters., u .-o the opportunity might he tahen, in connection v/itn tne proposed understanding v/ith Italy# to deal with the question of Anglo-Italian relations in Arabia and the Yemen- before proceeding further with the matter, however, the Foreign Office wished to obtain the views, particularly 01 hie Service Departments, as to the importance of tne Yemen as an Imperial interest# It ha.d ueen descrioed u&gt;_&gt; a ”vital” Imperial interest that Italy should not estab-^isn herself in the Yemen - but how far were we prepared to go to prevent this? For example, was as mucn importance attached to keeping Italy out of the Yemen as co re Gaining the control of the Suez Canal? The Suez Canal was accepted as a ’’vital” Imperial interest, but it v/as not so well established that we should be prepared to go to war for the VmnAn * CAPTAIN PHILLIPS said if an authoritative view on the strategical aspects of the Yemen was required, it would be necessary for the Foreign Office to ask tne Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee for a report# He could only express an unofficial opinion at the present time# He recalled that in 1927 it was considered important to prevent Italy or any other European Power esoaolishing themselves on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea and it seemed that events since that date had not lessened tne importance of this# The width of the Rod Sea at its Souchem end was only 15 miles, and Italy, by the use of big guns on the Western side could make it most inconvenient, but could not prevent the passage of the Straits? In the event o_ her placing guns on the Eastern and Western sides of the Straits however, it would probably only be possible to effect0 t, j a passage iDy night# It also seemed that if Italy occupied 'both the Eastern and Western shores, air attack on shipping would he rendered much easier* Another point was that with Italy in occupation of the Yemen a land attack on Aden was a possibility and we should presumably have to strengthen our garrison accordingly, though such an attack could not be made in strength unless we lost control of the Red Sea# be stressed the importance of Kamaran Island which had the only good harbour in the Red Sea, and which was on the Yemen coast# MR. RENDER agreed with 'Hie suggestion that the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee should be asked for a report on the strategical importance to us of maintaining the independence and Integrity of the Yemen as against Italy. WING- COMMANDER PIRIE also agreed, but said that the Air Ministry probably did not attach so much importance as the Admiralty to idle Yemen, as the Italians could operate aircraft over any part of the Red Sea equally well from Eritrea. It might be that the object of the Italian propaganda in the Yemen was to prevent our establishing a base there, rather than to establish themselves in that country# MR# RENDER said our attitude had been that it was extremely important to prevent the Italians establishing themselves in the Yemen# The reasons were not only strategic but also political, since the establishment of the Italians in the Yemen would be a severe blow to our prestige in Arabia, where we were still the pre-eminent Power# Apart from possible developments in connection with Palestine, which might, in certain circumstances, have very serious results for us throughout the Arab and Moslem world, the Arabs were prepared - 3 -to remain on good terms with us, as they considered that we were the strongest and least interested of European Powers, That was a matter of great importance, parti cularly in connection with the safety of the route to India, etc. But, if Italy established herself in the Yemen, either in spite of us, or with our connivance, our prestige in the Arab and Moslem world would go down. MR. CLAUSON said that the India Office were of course primarily interested from the point of view of communications with India. So far as they were aware it was as impcinant now as in 1927 that no other European power should establish itself on the Arab coast of the Red Sea. A re-afi irmation of the Rome understanding of 1927 should be acceptable to the Italians, and would be quite satisfactory xrom tne India Office point of view. After further discussion it was agreed, that the Foreign Office should obtain the views of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee on the importance of the Yemen, as an Imperial interest, from the strategical point of view. THE SUB-COMMITTEE then considered whether the question of the Yemen should be raised at the outset of the conversations for an Anglo-Italian d6aente. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS said it was for consideration whether the Italians would run the risk of antagonising us over the Yemen. He referred to Italy’s traditional desire to keep on good terms v/ith Great Britain, which it seemed to him nothing but the action taken hy the League of Nations last year could have caused her to depart from. The Admiralty felt very strongly on the necessity for He did not consider that Anglo-Italian friendship.V A Italy was likely to coiiiiiit a breach of the Rome under^ standing of 1927 in present circumstances 0 The Admiralty would he very reluctant to see the present negotiations fail, and if the Yemen questions would preclude any chance of obtaining the main agreement, he felt that they should be dropped for the present. MR. RENDER said that the Foreign Office were fully alive to the desirability of concluding a general Anglo- Italian understanding. It had been decided, however, that the question of Anglo-Italian relations in Arabia and the Red Sea ought not to be raised in the initial stages of the discussions for such an understanding, i»e. , that it should not be taken up, as Sir Robert Vansittart had recently put it, 'in the first round'. Tjie question was whether it would be desirable to raise the question in the second round. The Rome understanding of 1927 was in many respects inappropriate and unsatis factory. There would be obvious advantages in getting something clearer and more adequate. If, as Wing Commander Pirie had suggested, the main Italian pre occupation was indeed the fear that His Majesty f s Government might establish themselves in the Yemen, it might be easier to reach a new understanding with the Italians that would be satisfactory to both parties. On tixe other hand if the matter were taken up and no agreement were reached, our position might be worse than before, since we might have thrown doubt on the efficacy of the Rome understanding to no purpose. More over, Italy could not be relied upon to observe any treaty undertaking as such.. Whether she observed her undertakings to us or not seemed likely to depend sn how- 6 - V anxious she was to remain on good terms with us in major European and Mediterranean questions. If she wished to remain on good terms with us, she would probably sufficiently observe the spirit of the Rome understanding, and a further understanding might be unnecessaryo If on the other hand she was prepared, in view of her general political relations with us, to violate the Rome understanding of 1927, she might be equally ready to violate any new undertaking she might give us. At the same time Italian intrigues in the Yemen had recently increased and were causing great anxiety in Arabia. If anything could be done to check or reduce them, it would be to the good. THE CHAIRMAN asked whether the Committee were prepared to recommend that at a suitable time, in the event of the first stage of negotiations for the Anglo- Italian settlement being satisfactory, the question of a revision of the Rome understanding of 1927 should be taken up. WING COMMANDER PIRIE agreed with Captain Phillips as to the necessity for a general settlement in the first place, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS emphasized the necessity for a general agreement, and suggested that it might be wiser for the present that the Rome understanding should not be taken up. He quoted a remark made to him some time ago, that in Arabia nothing was mere permanent than the temporary.MR*SEAL considered that, although the Rome understanding cannot he regarded as entirely satisfactory, it would he difficult to hreach the question of a revision with the Italians without suggesting that in some degree at any rate we were doubtful of its binding force* He, therefore, thought that we should leave it to the Italians to raise the question of the Rome understanding. After further discussion it was considered that the Sub-Committee should recommend that whilst appreciating that the Rome agreement was in some ways inadequate and inappropriate, they were disposed to think that the possible disadvantages of His Majesty’s Government taking the initiative in attempting to obtain a re-affirmation of the Rome agreement outweighed the possible advantages. THE CIIAIRMATT then referred to Telegram Ho. 97 dated 10th December, 1936, from the Resident, Aden, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Sir Bernard Reilly had given his opinion as to our future policy in regard to the Yemen, and the action in the event of the death of the King, After discussion it was agreed that the contents of Sir Bernard Reilly’s telegram should be accepted, and that the view of the Sub-Committee in regard to our policy and action on the death of the King, should be recorded as follows :- Subject to the views of the Chiefs of Staff, the Sub-Comm .11 tee consider that British policy requires that neither the Yemen nor any part cf it should fall under the control of any European Power. There -7-is no question t'f gi\ing encouragement to opponents of the recognised heir; and in the event cf the death of the King, His Kalesty’s Government should recognise Seif el Islam Ahmed as soon as it appears that he is accepted as Imam, hut should remain neutral and retain freedom of action if his misrule leads to civil war 0 In that case His Majesty’s Government should reach an understanding with the de facto ruler of the Yemeni provinces adjoining the Aden Protectorate and of Hodeidah and should endeavour to counteract other foreign influences in these districts* THE CHAIPJvIAM then raised the question of the use of broadcasting in Arabic to which Mr. Seagar had referred in paragraphs 21 to 26 cf his report of 28th October, 1936. MR*BLAXTER said that the Colonial Office had already in draft a letter to the Chief Secretary of Palestine, asking what could be done in this respect by the Palestine Broadcasting Station^ MR. RENDER explained that the question of British broadcasting in the Middle East had long been under consideration and was now being actively pursued by the News Department of the Foreign Office in consultation with various other authorities in England and the Middle East. He was not fully informed as to the precise present position but he suggested that if the Sub-Committee thought it desir able that the matter should be pursued, the Colonial Office should take it up direct with the News Department of the Foreign Office and the other Departments concerned. After further discussion it was agreed that the matter of broadcasting in Arabic for reception in theV y Hear and Middle East should he taken up hy the Colonial Office in conjunction with other Departments concerned, MR* SEAL suggested that the Sub-Committee should consider making a recommendation in regard to the necessity for intensifying our activities in the Yemen: for example, despatching more doctors - prospecting for oil, etc. The amounts of money involved would be very small, and it would be of advantage to show more political interest in this area. If it were true that Italy is more concerned with priority encroachments on our part in the Yemen than v/ith her own hold over the country such activities on our part would be likely to lead Italy herself to propose a re-affirmation of the Rome understanding which would suit our book very well. In his view the understanding was by no means a satisfactory instrument ? and if Italy took the Initiative in this way our negotiating position would be a good one. TiiE CHAIRkAIT said that he thought we must go cautiously, but that if only we could have Consular represent ation in the Yemen, that would be the most effective means of obtaining a greater influence in the country, even -chough it involved other countries like Italy having recognised Consular representatives. MR, COWELL reminded the Cub-Corrmittee that the King of the Yemen had previously been opposed to the appointment of Consuls. MR. RIILDEL agreed that it would be most desirable to have an official representative in the Yemen. He appreciated the difficulties which the Imam had hitherto placed in the way of such representation, but he wondered whether it might not bepossible to get over these difficulties if instead of trying to appoint a diplomatic representative at Sanaa we merely tried to secure the acceptance of a Consular officer at Hodeidarn He had not obtained any instruction on the point, hut he thought the Foreign Office would certainly raise no objections to such a proposal. The appointment of a Consular officer at Hodeidah would have the further advantage of showing that we were closely watching the situation in the Yemen, and it might thus help to reassure Ibn Saud, TRY CHAIRMAN suggested that if the King of the Yemen sent a responsible Minister to represent him at the Coronation, the matter might perhaps be taken up by the Foreign Office with the Minister, After further discussion it was considered that if it could be arranged, it would be desirable to have a British representative at Hodeidah, if not at Sanaa, and that the Foreign Office and Colonial Office should be invited to pursue this matter. CONCLUSIONS. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed: (a) To invite the Foreign Office to ask the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee for a report on the importance of the Yemen from the strategical point of view, as an Imperial interest.To record their view that, whilst appreciating that the Rome understanding of 1927 is in.some ways inadequate and inappropriate, they are disposed to .hmlc that the possible disadvantages j aiesty’s Government taking the mioiati/e in attesting to obtain a re-affirmation or review of the Rome understanding out weighs the possible advantages* To recommend, subject to the views of the Chiefs of Staff, that the -p^-i- ivi ■nn'i i nv should be adopced: British policy requires that neither the Yemen nor any part of it should fall under the control of any European Power* There is no quesuion of giving encouragement to opponents of the recognised heir; and in the event of the death of the Kin&amp;j Hio Majesty 1 s Government should recognise Seif el Islam Ahmed as soon as it appears that he is accepted as Imam, but should remain neutral and retain freedom of action if his misrule leads to civil war. In that case^ His Majesty’s Government should reach an understanding with the de fax to ruler of the Yemeni provinces ad joining the ^den Protectorate and of Hodeidah and should endeavour to counteract other foreign influences To invite the Colonial Office, in con junction with other Departments concerned, to consider the question oi broadcasting m Arabic for reception in the Near and Middle East. To recommend that the appointment of a British Consular representative in the Yemen is desirable, and to invite the Foreign Office and Colonial Office to purcue this matter.V ft r *i'» ! PQ | _ L.'.'ilZ-J I^ rr ■ Q laa.SQ.Il&gt; As regards the Yemeni succession, the policy recommended by Sir B. Reilly seems the only one. But if in due course there is a civil war between Ahmed and the Ibn el Wazir family, and if the Italians back one side, which proves to be the winning horse, the situation will clearly be one of great difficulty for H.M.G. Events will clearly need careful watching. There seems much to be said for reaffirming the Rome understanding of 7th February, 1927. The immediate subject of the present conversations is British and Italian interests in the Mediterranean; but British interests in the Red Sea are exactly the same as those in the Mediterranean, so far as India is ^ - concerned, and it would be difficult to secure the f-opwer v ''~ ^ without the latt-er. When the present conversations have reached a certain point, it would be logical, and might be easy, to peg on to them a reaffirmation of British and Italian interests in the Red Sea.

Sir, With reference to the end of paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 352 of 22nd July last, I have the honour to t ran slid t herewith a Memorandum prepared hy Captain Bo'.'o Seager, .--cting Political Secretary, on Italian activities in the femen and connected matter. 2. I wish to draw your attention to the question raised by Captain Seager on page 9 of his Memorandum and I should be grateful if I may be informed of your views on this subject. I have etc., (Signed) C, W. LAKE. Acting Resident, etc. The Right Honourable v ! .G.A. Ormsby-Gore, P.Co, Secretary of State for the Colonies, Dovoing 31 ree t, 3 .' r 0 1. -1-MEMORANDUM, In the ensuing memorandum I will (A) commence with a Uriel statement about certain Italian nationals in the Yemen, (B) endeavour to portray a sKetch of the outlooK of Yemenis vis a vi s of foreigners in general which would account for, (C) a delinition of what is in my opinion the essence of present Italian policy in the Yemen, which is forced on tnem by (B), together with a speculative expose' on their objectives and other connected matter, (D) set out and discuss certain aspects of the internal political situation in the Yemen with particular regard to the future and, (E) conclude with a sketchy memorandum on the Yemeni Army and its war resources generallyo (a) The information that can be assembled oi visible Italian activities in the Yemen has been included in the Aden weekly Political Intelligence Summaries from time to time, and I do not consider it important enough to warrant repetition here, I will, however, refer briefly here to the 3 Italian doctors in the Yemen, v/ho are, in my opinion, the persons through whom Italian policy, or, to be more precise, through whom secret Italian activities are being directed. This last I will enlarge upon later. There are three Italian doctors in the Yemen? one at Santa (Dr, Dubbiosi) to whom the other two are subordinate| one at Ta f iz in Seiyid f Ali ibn al Wazir’s governorate; and one in Hodeida in Seiyid Abdullah ibn Al V/azir’s governorate. These doctors can be said to have been absorbed into the Yemeni administration, temporarily anyhow, but they are paid by Italy while the costs of the medical services, medicines, etc,, are paid ior by the Yemeni Government, These doctors-3- go about their duties quite naturally, and, to an observer, they are merely European doctors in a foreign land. It has heen my personal experience when taiming to them that they go out oi their way to talK platitudes and are very careful to avoid all mention of politics. Doctor Jubbiosi, during the Italo-Abyssinian war, caused news bullet ins,to be circulated to high Yemeni officials, but this he did quite openly. (B) An experienced traveller in Arab countries, on arrival in the Yemen, will be at once strucK with its bacKwardness, its unworldliness and the mentality of its inhabitants — particularly that of the Zeidi ruling class — which can be liKened, if I can hazard a guess, to the mentality which ruled in Mecca hundreds of years ago. All are bigoted and fanatical Moslems, and suspicious to a degree which has to be seen and felt if it is to be believed. All are instinctively anti-foreigner, but this they cannot help as it is in-born; it is thus easier to understand why it is fixed in their minds that every foreigner - be; he a resident or a visitor - is bent on some mission or vocation detrimental to Yemeni interests, and, as such, harmful and dangerous to associate with them at all. Thus all European visitors and residents, for instance, whatever the length of their stay, have to house a Yemeni guard which is planted on them simply for the purposes of spying and reporting on their movements to the Palace where this intelligence is collected. On my two stays in San 1 a in 1935, for example, my guard commander used to proceed to the Palace two or three times a day to report on my doings 5 and if I ever suggested, what was to him an extraordinary request, such as a proposal to visit the local museum, which was fifty paces from my bedroom, and which visit would necessarily be in his company, he would grimly tell me this was impossible without authority$ and off he would trot to the Palace to getsanction 9 which was refused more times than it was grant edo It is in this Kind of atmosphere that the foreigner lives in San*a and it is as had, if not worse, in the other hig towns e.go Hodeida, Ridha, Dhamar. The foreigner is a tormented being in this sense and his movements, speech and even his intimate life are quite unashamedly and openly spied upon, I owell on these homely details with a purpose and crave indulgence for doing so hut it is essential, at this stage of the memorandum, that I should bring out and lay stress on the efficient supervision and rigid control Kept over foreigners in the Yemen at all times. (C) In the light of the foregoing it is obvious that an observer who sets out with the avowed intention oi making a study of Italian subversive activities in the Yemen w r ill be sadly disappointed if he thinks he is going to see any tangible evidence of these activities. The reasons are not far to seek as in the circumstances it is obvious that nothing but a secret and underground policy - which, to put it briefly and compactly, is, in my opinion, aimed at undermining the King T s authority - can be followed if any headway is to be made in a country whose King is so fanatically determined to shut out any form of foreign penetration and infiltration. No one Knows this better than the Italians themselves, and no one knows better how the natural anti-foreign bias and hostile atmosphere cramps their style. They have accordingly been compelled, as far as one can reasonably judge, to suborn and intrigue v/here they would have wished, had it been possible, to penetrate more openly and more quickly in the hope of urging this small kingdom, of its own volition, and, in spite of itself, to lean dependently on Fascist Italy. In any event, whatever this policy, and whatever their objectives, there is not much doubt that the Italian authority is causing substantial sums of money to be paid5- A Ik secretly to high officials in the Yemen,, (See Appendix A* at the end or the memorandum.) Real proof in support of this sweeping statement there is none. ; and, it would he extremely difficult to find, because it follows that the success of this Italian policy necessarily depends entirely on the skill with which it can he hidden from a very inquisitive public; and it is clear that it would he disastrous to Italian interests if they were found out. In the absence of any evidence one has to fall hack on reasoned conjecture if one is to guess at Italian objectives and there must he objectives. I accordingly venture to submit the following i- As far bacK as 1925 Fascist Italy interested herself in the Yemen, and her purpose in so doing may have been dictated purely by commercial reasons at the outset, but I do not thinx so if only because of her political interest in the Idrisi. In any event her interest was real, even if she was precipitate at the outset. The Yemenis profited by her precipitancy, and, while fending off warm advances, managed in inimitable fashion to get a rake off. ' 5i r 0 i suppose, damped Italian ardour to a certain extent if it did not anger them, but a lesson had been learned and one can assume that stock was taken of the peculiar circumstances ruling and the initiation of a subtler and different kind of iDolicy was envisaged and applied. In 1933 I assume that Italian political interests began to overshadow any comaiercial interests she might have had, and still has in the Yemen, if only because of the growing tension in Saudi - Yemeni relations; and in 1934, following the conclusion of the Anglo-Yemeni treaty, which preceded the Saudi-Yemeni war, *Not reproduced.- 6 - it is natural to suppose that her political interest was thoroughly awaKenedo At the end of 1954 -if not long before - the conquest of Abyssinia was contemplated.,, and in the light of such a campaign further stocK was doubtless taKen of the position vis a vis Eritrea’s neighbours on the Eastern littoral of the Red Seao It would no doubt have been apparent at once that Yemeni neutrality and friendli ness to Italy would count as a great asset in such a campaign 9 as 9 apart from any other consideration - and there are other considerations - the Yemen would serve as an excellent buffer state between the colony of Aden and the Aden Protectorate on the one part and Italian possessions in Africa on the other 0 Prom this I surmise there was probably a secret recrudescence of activity in the Yemen and I do not doubt that the Italiars increased their payments or bribes to senior Yemeni officials 9 particularly to those in Gan’a,, That this alleged policy proved successful in the campaign is clear as the Yemenis (l) maintained a policy of helpful friendliness (2) provided tens of thousands oi their boot labourers so sorely needed by the Italians (3) supplied meat 9 vegetables, chicKens, eggs, and grain, etc., in fleets of dhows, and (4) (here I snate on very thin ice as it is sneer conjecture) kept Anglo—Yemeni relations amicable out at a standstill 0 , by this I mean that the Yemeni Government avoided the taking of even minor decisions in matters affecting both administrations which would, no doubt, have resulted in a much closer raocroch*-ment and understandingo It can be argued, however, perfectly logically, tnat tne Yemeni Government 'would have taxmen the line it did in any event, but, as a t&gt;rivileged close watcher of events, I noticed that, during the campaign, Italian influence was in evidence in that it wore down the Yemeni Government to\ -7- 13 „ A relax restrictions which it had imposed at the beginning of the operations e.g. decision to refuse permission to Yemeni labourers who wished to proceed to worx for the Italians in Sritrea and Italian domalilando Be that as it may - it is now a matter of the past - it is my considered opinion that secret Italian influence in the Yemen is strong to-day 9 and that in the circumstances 9 it would be well if a much closer watch was Kept on their ''activities’* in that country as graver issues might arise in the near or distant iutureo The Italian campaign in Abyssinia is officially over 9 and 9 no doubt ? a review is being made oi Italian political relations with the Yemen owing to the changed circumstances in the Red Sea; while the Italo-femeni Treaty expires in December next and this alone should call for fresh stocK-t aiming * The major issues raised by the recent regional understandings in Europe and the non-recognition to date of the Italian conquest of Abyssinia make it easy for me to believe that Italy would very much like to strengthen her hold in the Yemen, if only in order to safeguard her flank on the Eastern littoral of the Red Sea; and in this connection the Yemeni ports of Sheikh Sa’id, alocha, Hodeida, Luheiya and Meidi would be of value to her» in the light of the Rome conversations of 1S27 it is clear that Italy is precluded from taking the initiative and establishing herself at these ports, that is to say, ix she continues to adhere to the decisions taken in the course of these conversations, but it might be different if circumstances arose and she was invited by the Yemenis in the Tihama and elsewhere to occupy the Yemeni sea coast» That such an invitation might be forthcoming may sound preposterous, but domestic politics in the Yemen to-day, v/here the current topic of the day is the Imamic succession, may lend themselves to such a contingency in certain given circumstances»A(D) The Yemeni Kingdom is firmly held together by King Yahya and by King Yahya alone; and all are agreed in the Yemen that when he dies conditions will become chaotico The Shafa'is who inhabit the Tihama almost exclusively together with a belt of coyntr*y adjoining the Anglo-Yemeni frontier^ are thoroughly disgusted with Zeidi rule 9 v/hich is particularly harsh and tyrannical - if it is the only hind of administration which can succeed with such a turbulent population. The Zeidis desoise the Shafa f is and treat them with the utmost contempts in fact they look upon them as heretics and unbelievers and spurn them accordingly. The Yemeni Shafa’is are a proud sect who lack cohesion, and are, of course, groaning in misery. They have, generally speaking, insufficient backbone to make good rebels and can be defined as good conspirators, who prefer intrigue and treachery but if led and inspired, might do well for a time and before their natural characteristics broke up their unity. As they would always be too jealous to agree to a Shafa f i leader in any insurrectionary movement, they might, ir. certain circumstances, agree to a Zeidi leader and a Zeidi leader might be available in the given circumstances; but I must advert to the question of the Imamic Succession belore proceeding any further. As I have said previously the burning question of the day in the Yemen is the Imamic succession; and this is inter alia exercising the minds of Seif al Islam Ahmed, the Imam’s eldest son and probable, but, by no means, certain, successor, and the great V/azir family who to-day govern more than half the Yemen through their relations and satellites. Seif al Islam Ahmed’s stronghold is in the Zeidi highlands, where the Wazir’s own immense and valuable property, and the Wazir’s stronghold is in the Tihama (where they hold the key positions in the administration from Sheikh Sa’id to . oidi ^ and the whole-9- V V Mb of the Shaia' i 'belt — less one stretch of about twenty miles ~ nf,joining the Anglo-Yemeni frontier. Seif al Islam Ahmed detests the V/azirs and has marKed them out for destruction if he is able to do so and if he comes to powers the ’.Vazirs know this so well that (a) they have unsuccessfully tried to obtain assurances of support from this Residency in the event of iuture trouble v/hich they confidently anticipate and (b) they have 9 according to our Political ClerK in Ilodeida^ been corresponding secretly with the Italian authorities in Assab 5 while the Officer Commanding Ta f iz 9 Seiyid 'Ali ibn Al Wazir - the brains and diplomatist of the family - told me quite frankly last yec-.r that the Italians had maae several overtures to him v/hich he had firmly rejected,, It follows then that a critical position may arise and grave issues be raised, in the days and months following King Yahya's death. If Geif al Islam Ahmed succeeds - and he is consideied to be the favourite - and .he follows his avowed intention ofbrc.lcjrg U p the y/azir family there is no reason why the latter, in self defence for instance, should not invite the intervention of Italy if they are unable - as they would prefer - to stand alone by themselves as leaders of the Shafa’is in the Tihama anyhow, or as kings of a new lhafa'i Kingdom; and, to carry conjecture a bit further, it is not impossible that the Yazirs are at present engaged in arriving at a working agreement along these lines, I am convinced that they - and indeed all Yemenis - would prefer our intervention, if anyone hen to intervene, but, as we do not appear disposed to come into the j)icture at a time when th€;y are much exercised about the future, I suppose they feel compelled, in the circumstances, to cultivate on what may be fertile soil.Whether., to go o.ie ste.p I'ar«: jer 9 Italy could or would intervene is another matter^ hut I believe she would like to do so if she dared to face up to the grave issues which would at once ariseo There is a point which I should liKe to bring up here*, the Italian conquest of Abyssinia has much impressed all Yemenis as it has frightenea them badly; and being impressed and frightened at the same time it would not very much surprise the writer if the Italian Mission which should visit the Yemen in the course of the next five months in connection with the expiring Italo-Yemeni Treaty^ found them actually malleable and obliging.. I thimc that the Italian Mission will not be satisfied with an innocuous treaty this time and may perhaps try to bounce the Yemeni Govern ment into the granting of concessions 9 the nature oi which might create some misgivings in the mind of His Majesty's Government. This ? of course* is pure speculation, but the Yemen, with its mind already anticipating the death of the King, who at present is probably more nervous than any of his subjects, feels that it has its bacK to the wall and that Italian demands - if these are in fact put forward - should be met as a way out of a muddle or as a measure to ward off destruction. In the circumstances I should be glad it I may be in formed whether, on my journey to the Yemen at the beginning of October next, I may, should I be consulted, be able to oii^r the King any form of assurance that His Majesty’s Government, ior instance, have the welfare oi the Yemeni Kingdom at heart and would view with disfavour any infringements of her sovereign rignb£? In conclusion I must, of course, emphasise strongly that unforeseen happenings - and these are not uncommon in countries like the Yemen - may change the whole course of events in the Yemeni Kingdom before, or after, the present King's death, but, the moment of drafting this memorandum, I believe that I have reason and it is incumbent on me to set out this endn ol conjee ture even if I may have forged links of a questionable consistence Bo Wo SEAGER» Aden, 18th August, 1936.

The reasons for this have seen set out ±n the above papers ana it would serve no useful purpose xf I seat the bounds again ana savertea to the subject of the tactics employeu by the Italians in the Yemen. I might say again defo-e I leave the subject, that in the present circumstances I fear we are totally unfitted through lack of fun..s to even dare to pretend that we have fathomed or correctly mterpxetea Italian designs - ana it is clear they have designs of some sox’t unless they love the Yemenis as brothers ana insist on a wholly disinterested role of public philanthropy - as only an espionage system can be expected to co;ie v.iti* an organisation whose mam shoots are bribery and corruption on a large scale. I realise that the Aden Government has but only a fragmentax j y knowledge of the essence of the present Italian policy xn Moslem countries as our vision is necessarily limited to the Yemen where we know of the existence - to keep it within its proper proportions - of a small underground tributary of muduy rater flowmg from the main stream which can be toimed Italian Moslem policy. Whereas, we h ve the doubtful privilege of guessing where is this tributary and where it leads - ana m our imagination it looms ahem as a dreadful monster - it is pre-supposed and not overlooked that a number of important organisations, both official ana private, 'whose secrets are necessarily locked up in Whitehall, have been and ore concentrated on a study of the main trend of Italian Moslem pol±cy, ana connected off shoots, directed from Rome.

It is sad to relate in this connection that in the whole of the Yemen there is only one British (European) national: Mr. L.It. Brown of Messrs.

I do not hnov'/ whetner he coimuunicateu this infoimation to Lonuon but I record his statement fox what it may be worth. o. Thxough a conversation I had with Raghib in connection with the Yemeni Government’s request for a British aoctox* ana X.uy doctor, I have obtained a fresh line on the financial amangements governing the appointments of the Italian doctors m the Yemen. -15--16- Attached 9. See paragraph 4 above: (a; anu (c) ai'e iiia;jors and (b) (d; ana (ej captains m the Italian Ari.iy Medical Sex vice. Each xS paia 300 dollars a month (about £30 at present rate) by the Yemeni Goverix^eiit who also pay fox all their living expenses and supply all extras aovvn to cigarettes ana matches! rent is a charge on the aoctoxe but it is a negligible charge as it is only three pounds sterling per house per month* Raghib (who shoula know!) went on to say that the doctors also receive the pay and allowances of their ranks from the Italian Government: ana on this basis (a) ana (c) shoula receive in all at least £70 a month each ana (b) (d) ana (e) about £60 e ch. As they have no expenditure, other than the rent referreu to above, they must ao themselves extremely well though it is fair to say that without such attractive t- financial considerations Sux 5 opeans coula not put up with the ueaa ana alive life m the Yemen. 10. The salaries of the five Italian doctors ana two engineers together with the pay of Dx. Duboiosi*s Secretary, must cost the Italian Government aoout £300 a month and this is a conservative estimate. I have askea Dr. Petxie to prepare me a short report which I will attach 5 * to this memorandum - on the medical siue of the Italian doctor’s activities. Amongst other things, it appears that the Italians have presented the Yemen Govern- ment with an X-Ray apparatus, which, according to Dr. Petne is the best one he has seen bet een Palestine ana India. 11. Local reports have it that the Italian bribery ana corruption account exceeds a total of £500 a month. This shoula, of course, be taken with ieserve, but, I do not think it woulu. surprise me to hear that the monthly disbursement on all their services etc. in the Yemen cost the Italian Government a total of £1,000.-17- ** {nu\ I nx-esuiiie that Vc.lue ib oein^,' reccivect fn this uioney.

Seager, the Frontier Officer, as a result of his recent visit to San'a. 2, Captain Seager has written an interesting review of the present position in the Yemen, with which I am in general agreement, although I cannot endorse the reflections made in paragraph 16 of his Memorandum on the avarice of the King of the Yemen and his officials, or on the had breeding and the lack of manners of the latter. I have personally met with consistent courtesy in ^ c* I r.3 g wi 1 ’H. whom I Yemen from the King and all his o„.« into contact, end I tell.™ this to t. the experience of other officers who visited this country, Wlth regard to money, there is no doubt that both the King and his officials value it very highly, but I cannot agree that , . . on else: there are many matters the King puts it before an eis in which money will not tempt him, and I think that the same is true of some, at least, of his officials. 3 , tir. Salih Ja'far, the Political Clerk m Hodeida, has recently also submitted an interesting report on internal conditions in the Yemen, of which he gives a picture similar to that portrayed by Right Hon. W.G.A. Ormsby-Gore, Secretary of State for the Colonies, Downing Street, S.W. 1. _ 2 i_DOI/ EDST IC POLIT ICS I1T THE YEMEN * il General o The Yemeni Kingdom held together hy King Yahya f s personality alone&gt; is quiet externally 'but is simmering with discontent internally* All classes and creeds of the population? including the officials? are dissatisfied with the present administration, if the reasons for this dissatisfaction are not identical* 2* The Zeidi and Shafai populations - particularly the latter - :m a land administered in accordance with the Sharia Law are 'being exploited and tyrannised 'by a limited 'band of senior and influential Zeidi officials? each of whom has an army of corrupt satellites to assist in the exploitation of the mass* A harsh rule? in my opinion? is justified as the population is very mixed and extremely turbulent; and the mass even if it complained under this head are well aware themselves that a harsh policy is no more than they deserve; but their exploitation is monstrous* For instance? the collection of the yearly u ashur M or 10/o tax of the agricultural produce is a scandal* The 10?o tax is duly collected and transmitted to the Treasury in San T a after which the exploitation begins* The Governor of the district wants his rake off; his sub-governor or sub-governors want the same and similarly with all the subordinate officials. The Sheikh of the parish wants his share also while the soldiery (or ’'organised banditry” as they have aptly been described by a Red Sea Sloop Commander) taxe what they like and when they like* Complaints are not listened to and if a peasant? goaded into despair, takes the extreme measure of killing his tormentor, the most dreadful retribution follows. The result is that the population is cowed - in particular the Shafa’is - and poverty is rife. -2C--24- 3o i.r* % Hope Gill of His Majesty's Consular Service, who accompanied me to San‘a, commented on the apparent poverty of the population in what is a very rich land and rightly expressed his astonishment at this phenomena* 4*. The majority of the officials, particularly those of minor standing, suffer at the hands of the limited hand of senior Zeidi officials referred to in paragraph 2* Their pay is very sns.il and their duties onerous# their turn too they grind the face of the peasant while always hearing a hatred for the central Yemeni Governmento 5« In my opinion the country is ready either (a) for civil strife when it gets the chance or when King Yahya relaxes his grip or (h) foreign occupation. I helieve the country would welcome either in cheery and whichever cane first* Civi3 striie would give them a chance of relieving their pent up feelings while foreign occupation would he a novelty or a change which they desire and which they imagine would he an improvement on their present lot.. Personalities in the Yemen and connected matter . 6* I found, to my surprise, on my recent visit, that the entire judicial machinery in the capital, was in the hands of Seif A1 Islam Ahmed, the 'Crown Prince', who dis penses justice sitting on a chair under an umbrella near a side-entrance to the palace visible to us from our Sanayah residence# It appears that his illustrious father has delegated certain powers to him in order to give him a taste of judicial administration*7, From all reports which I have heard to date the 'Crown Prince” can he vulgarly described as a nasty mess. He is said to possess every vice? and against all logical reasoning, appears to he doing his best to get himself* thoroughly detested. If these reports are true I can only assume he has grave defects in his character which he is unable to correct or even curb as it is obviously a suicidal policy to follow, On the other hand there are reports that the peasantry do net view him with disfavour as his judgments, just or unjist' are pronounced at once and carried into y r* 11 'h t ri yi r , n the sDoti ano. thii Yemen and greatly appreciated* The peasantry are not a force to be reckoned with in present days but that the ’’Crown Prince” should show any statesman—like qualities is well worthy of comment. I think he is a firm believer in the mailed fist as the sole solution of all difficulties and has got himself into hot water with his distinguished fauher by threatening all manner of local notables with the most fearful punishment when displeased with them® 8. The current topic of the day? as it was in 1935, is. the Irnamic succession and is discussed daily in the households of the great and the small® The general con census of opinion is that the 'Crown Prince” will succeed but that his reign will be a short one. He is rumoured to have some at taches with the Italians, but I da not, at present; attach much importance to these reports® 9j 1 was also surprised to hear on my present visit that Seiyid Abdullah Ibn A1 Wasir? Governor of Hodeida (and cousin of Seiyid All Ibn A1 Wazir? Governor of Ta'iz andbrother of Beiyid 1 uhawmad Ibn A1 v/azir, Governor of Dhamar) intends in due course to put forward his candidature for the Inarnate; and that he is at present spending considerable sums of irtcney in propagating his cause in the Yemeni (Zeidi) highlendso If this report is true it is an interesting development since my last visit here in June 1935, I do not doubt that the “Crown Prince” is aware of Seiyid Abdullah’s activities and this will no doubt even further strain their relations which are already at breaking point* 10o In the light of the foregoing, if the ’’'Crown Prince” does succeed in the first instance it is possible that Seiyid Abdullah Ibn A1 Wazir will succeed him if 210 fresh issues are raised before or after the present Imam’s death® 11® There are other candidates for the Imanate&gt; These are:- (a) Seiyid Ali Bin Hamid, Governor of Kaukaban, a district about 20 miles north west of San’a. (b) Seiyid Bin Abu Naib of Sada* (c) Seiyid Abdullah Bin Ahmed Bin Kassim Hamid Ud Din, a nephew of the Imam, These persons have local standing and might obtain local suoport but at present they lack funds, a fatal deficiency in this country* 12» Qadhi Abdullah A1 Amri f the ’’Prime Minister” appeared to be down in the mouth when I first saw him on my present visit; and, after the audience at which he was -26-present, I asked him whether he was feeling as well as he might,, He replied heavily that his duties were heavy and that he had 'been much pre-occupied of late» Prom reports which I have received his present state of mind can he explained,. He is said to he worried about the future of the Yemen and this is of course irrevocably hound up with his own future. His relations with the Imam are as cordial as ever* (He recently gave out that all those who had the welfare of the Yemeni Kingdom at heart should do their utmost to prolong King Yahya f s life). The Qadhi's relations with the ''Grown Prince' are not happy and it is most unhealthy to he in the latter’s had hooks. The 'Crown Prince' is probably occupying too xmch of the lime light at present and this cannot he very agreeable to the Qadhi. The latter’s relations with the Italians are said to he not so close as they were previously hut there is no doubt that he still has strong Italian attaches all the same. 13. Qadhi Muhammad Raghib Bey, the 'Minister for Foreign Affairs' is going as strong as ever and seems to he in the highest favour with the King, higher than he has probably ever been before* If anything he is bound up even more closely with the Italian cause. My relations witl him are excellent and cordial to an extreme but I belong to the cause which is not his so any advantages I could possibly derive from the closest friendship with him are completely neutralised by his opposite political leanings. 14. His relations with Seif A1 Islam Ahmed, the 'Crown Prince' are said to have improved as a result of the u -^ , l a 6gift£ efforts of _r. Dubbiosi, the head Italian doctor-28- in San’a; 'but I very much doubt, however, whether such is the case. The Italian doctor’s intervention is interesting;. He no doubt wants to be assured that in the event of the accession of the ‘'Crown Prince', who is an incapable administrator, Italian strings can be pulled through Paghib; but, that should the latter fail, or the 'Crown ^rince' strangle or expel him, the Italians might (a) foment internal disoraer with a view to an occupation of the country or (b) promise the 'Crown Prince' support against his enemies in the Yemen* 15, Raghib is said to have been mortally offended when the 'Crown Prince' divorced his (Raghib’s) daughter about 18 months ago. Negotiations are said to be in progress to restore the divorcee s to the 'Crown Prince’s' harem but so far nothing definite has materialised* 16, Raghib is astute, wily and tortuous, but is a most charming personality and certainly the only official in the Yemen v/ith any breeding or manners* I think he would like to favour the British cause as he is pro-British by instinct but money is his god as it is with the Yemeni King and all his officials* The fact is that he has real cause for alarm; he is an old man and as his future looks a most unpromising one his dismissal from Yemeni Government Service will mean destitution unless he can pile up money in the interim; and this he is doing* 17* On the day I left San T a he gave me cheques to the value of £550 which he asked me to nay into his account with Cowasjee’s in Aden* The cheques were sixiianttjf — — '''V. - - - in nmnber, and as in the ease of his recent financial operations the details of which are recorded in our archives P were payable to Dr o E* Dubbiosip the chief Italian doctor in San f a and by the latter made over to Haghib Bey* 18, I should like to affirm positively that he is in Italian nay but I cannot make this conclusive state ment until I have irrefutable evidence that such is the case. He has undoubtedly the strongest attaches with Dr c Dubbiosi and this in itself might be understandable as the latter is his medical adviser* but* under this head alone, he gives me cause for suspicion as he is positively clumsy in his endeavours to bring out, in a typically Turkish way* that he has no attaches at alls ’’Squared' minister for Foreign Affairs, placed in his unique position of sole foreign adviser to the Imam, who is probably the most suspicious and distrustful ruler in the world, is a menace; but the position would be grave if it were not for the fact (a) that Kaghib has an un holy respect for His LI a jesty f s Government (l have stated elsewhere that he is pro-British by instinct) and (b) that the Imam himself Is beginning to lean towards us in spite of the cautionings and warnings of his Italian paid entourage, Haghib has to follow his ruler’s lead but sets his traps and snares by arousing the Imam’s suspicions in any matter concerning his dealings with His Majesty’s Government through the den 19, This attache continues to distress me as a Government*Yemeni A&amp;ainist.ratlvQ Arroointioent so These were still pending when I left San’a and I emphasise that the appointments are still under con sideration., 20. It has been reported to me but not yet confirmed that the following appointments are under consideration - (a) Qadhi Muhammed Abdullah Asshami, a nroteye of the Wazirsji Governor of Hidha province who acts as Yemeni Frontier Officer? as Governor of Beidha. This in itself would not be a promotion but it is reported that it is intended to subordinate Ridha province to Beidha and this is important enough® This would give the Wazirs -an even firmer grip on the Aden/Yemeni frontier. Qadhi huhammad Abdullah Asshaini ? is a pious little man and much trusted by the L...am» Be is an expert in tribal matters and is of a retiring and shy disposition.

He no doubt expresses the sentiments of all 1 Moslems and Christian ,j?abs all over the world whose only language is Arabic. 23„ Though the Yemen has only four sets at present the information, news and/or propaganda broadcasted from Europe in jrabic, is soon circulated; and it is not then astonishing that the man in the street hears an Italian version of world events. It cannot be expected that he is to know the difference between news and propaganda. 24, In the circumstances I cannot urge strongly enough that we too broadcast in Arabic. Our bulletinswill le listened to and believed while Italian broadcasts in Arabic which may follow or precede ours will be discounted not a little because our version will be accepted before theirs* Such is still our great reputation in Moslem countries* 25. If, however, we continue to allow the Italians, amongst other nations, to have a clear field, we cannot hope to maintain our supremacy in Moslem eyes. 26.

The Resident at Aden,E (1769/3 Bri e isli Legai i on 5 Jedda 11th October 1936 Sir I have the honour to report that after the exchange of notes on October 3rd, Shepih Yusuf Yasin ashed whether he could see ue about certain other questions, and it was arranged that he should call at the Legation on October 5th. He had already ashed whether I wished to continue the discussion of the fuwait and frontier questions or would prefer to await the return of Fuad Bey Hamza, which was expected to occur /ery soon, and I had told him that the Saudi counter'-draft of Article 1 of the proposed Kuwait regulations against snuggling was being considered by His Majesty's Government and that as to the other matters it would perhaps be well for ue to wait until Fuad Bey’s return since I was new to the pest and needed as much tine as possible to mate myself fully acquainted with the relevant files. Sheylih Yusuf had made no objection to this, and had concluded that all questions of major interest were tuerefore in abeyance and .hat on October 5th he would discuss minor questions at issue, such as the black-listing of certain pilgrim guides. He however embarked upon a long statement on foreign affairs which he said he had been charged to make by His Majesty King Abdul Aziz. He spoke very carefully, hesitating from tine to time as though to recall Ibn Gaud’s exact words. The statement however was so clearly, in its more important parts, only a repetition The Right Honourable A nthony Eden, M c c 0 ? m.P. 9-36- o^r iaviy statenents nacU to the Legation during the Ethiopian dispute that it has been possible to cut down to a page or so the sir nary which I attach to the present despatch. 2 , in reply I said that Sheylch Yusuf must no o expec l. a detailed answeri I was ne 1 ' to the peso and I had nob been warned what he proposed to talx about. (I nigh„ have reminded him that when he ashed for a neeoing I had inquired whether he wished to s eak of anything of great importance, so that I night be prepared, and that he had waved this aside.) As to Palestine I was happy to say that v/hen I was received by Hr. Eden after my a ointment he authorised ne to convey to His Majesty Ping Abdul Azis his personal thanks for the help offered in connection with the Palestine dispute. On all other points except one ny remarks were purely conventional. The exception was Italy, thorn h even on this point I confined myself to general!ties. I said that it was clearly impossible for me tc go beyond statements made to the Saudi Government by Sir Andrew Ryan acting on instructions from His Majesty’s Government. For myself I would suggest that the Saudi Government should take a long view and not t ink only of the Ethiopian question, which had been comnlicated b;. the fact that the whole world was trying to find a solution by hitherto untried methods. The Saudi attitude towards the Italian offer of money and arms was presumably rcm ted by a desire to maintain their independence — an aim which must have the fullest sym oh,y oi His Majesty’s Government. His Majesty would do well to loox a/ain at the Rome Understanding of 1927. It was not usual to give such assurances as the Saudi Arab Government had wished to receive. What would happen would de ;end on world-37- A ru affairs, on a host of circmist&amp;ncos* The -ling had at lease one solid fact to , r o a &gt;on — oae 1 eng exjer'ience of His Ha jest v’ s Governnent to which S hegkh Yusuf had referred v/ioh appreciation* 1 seared, on.-.is v/ha.o Saeyiih Y.isux ano. s&lt;--.id would 'he rsnorted to the Foreign Oxxice and. i conduced v/ith suitable thanJis for the assurances of frie r shin, and with similar assurances on our own aart* 3.

Friendship with Kis Majesty’s Government had long been the basis of Ton Baud’s foreign policy. He hsa been in relations with them since the eaily days of his career and was grateful for their support. In particular he was grateful for the help they gave hin 1 at a moment when the Turks were aoout to attack him: they asked the Turks to ^ive them a few months’ notice before he beginning of hostilities, so that British subjects ana theii property might oe removed from Nejd, and in the interval he was able to come to terms with the Turks. Ibn Saua now saw danger in three quarters; near, farther off, ana remote, vis., Italy, Turkey and Gexmany. (N.B. Germany was not mentioned again). The Italians hau been the last to recognise Sauai Arabia, and their conduct in regard to Asir and the Yemen haa been very suspicious, but at the time of the gtniopicJi uispute there had been a complete revolution in their policy towards Saudi Arabia. Italy had recently wisned to ai ve Ibn Suudams ana munitions to the value ol perhaps a million pounas. He had not wanted to accpt, but to avoid giving offence he had accepted a few aeroplanes, had informed Sir Andrew Ryan ana haa askea whether His Majesty’s Government coula give him assurances, regretted that they had not been able to ao more than refer him to the Rome Understanding of 19&lt;,7.

I5N SAU D A D I TALIAN A MBI TIONS IN ARABIA, The Sau i Minister came to see me this evening and brought a very long confidential despatch in Arabic which he had just received from King Ibn Saud, M* Zada gave me the substance of the despatch as follows., But he seemed to find unusual difficulty in translating it and in making the points in it clear 0 2. As His Majesty’s Government would have observed, Ibn Saud had recently been consulting them more and more frequently on questions of foreign policy. This was because (l) he considered that the true interests of Arabia lay in friendship with Great Britain, (2) because he wanted to align his policy as far as possible with that of His Majesty’s Government, and (3) because he wished to do nothing which might cause His Majesty’s Government embarrassment. But he appreciated that the questions which' he asked them from time to time might also be embarrassing to them and he wished to know first of all whether His Majesty's Government welcomed this attitude on his part, or would prefer that he did not consult them so often. 3. The despatch went on in this strain for some time, nd then explained that Ibn Saud was ve?*y uneasy about the situation in various parts of Arabia, and in particular in the Yemen and in Iraq, Much propaganda was being carried on against His Majesty’s Government, who were being represented as the enemies of the Arabs, who were being incited to adopt a hostile attitude towards them in consequence® This propaganda had been carried on by the agents of four Powers in particular, viz., Italy, the Soviet Union, Germany and Turkey. 4. On my cross-questioning the Minister as to preciselywhet all this meant, it turned out that what it all 'boiled ^own to was thet Ibn Saud w.. s ve ’y uneasy about Italian propaganda in Arabia in general and about Italian intentions in the Yemen in particualr* Ibn Saud explained that Italian agents were being particualrly active in the Yemen, where they were, by bribes and propaganda, under mining the influence of the Imam. This might lead to the fall of the Imam, or in any case to the development of an extremely dangerous situation if the Imam should ior any reason disappear. Ibn Saud was anxious, if possible, to come to some understanding with His Majesty’ s Goveinmenc about the situation. j v/aited untix the whole of this d ccument had been explained before replying# I then began by repeating^ what I had often said before, that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciated and reciprocated Ibn Saud’s friendly feelings towards them, and appreciated in particular the way in which he wished to avoid any conflict of policy with them and from time to time consulted them on political questions with this object in view. There was certainly no reason wh^ Ibn Send should not continue to keep in touch with His Majesty’s Government on questions of policy, and His Majesty’s Government would always be glad to answer any questions he mighb ask them, whenever it was possible for them to do so# 6. As regards anti-British propaganda, the four countries which Ibn Saud had named as being responsible for it were in rather different categories. I was surprised to hear the Turks mentioned, as our relations with Turnkey had recently been particularly friendly. At this the Minister explained that Ibn Saud was no doubt thinking of the past. I said that if this was so, it was no good raking it up, but-42- thst I found it rather difficult to believe that the Tur^s were really carrying on any anti.-British propaganda now* As regards Germany, she wcs 5 of ccurse 5 keenly trying to develop and expand her commerce in the Middle Bast; while Soviet Russia was, by the nature oi things, boon r to Cc rry on propaganda everywhere in favour of her political ideas; but it would be useful to kno^ whether Ibn baud had any special cases in mind. In reply to this, the Minister admitted that the only propaganda about which Ibn Saud was seriously worries was th r t of Italy. He did not see i inclined tu follow'' up c.ny of the other suggestions, which may have been mere window- dressing. 7. I said that it w; s, of c urse, well known that loaly had been carrying cn a great deal of active propaganda all through the Middle East® We were well av/are that this had often been violently anti-British - e«go the broadcasts from Bari, etc©, which were well known. Moreover it was clear that a good deal of Italian money had at one time or another been spent in such propaganda activities. In so far as they might be carried on in Saudi Arabia itself, only King Ibn Saud himself could deal with chenr As regards such activities elsewhere., it would be useful to know v/hether Ibn Saud could give us any further detcils, end whether he had any definite suggestions to make. 8. The Minister replied that Ibn Saud had no definiuo urcposals; but merely wished to bring the facts to our attention, particularly with regard to Italian intrigues in the Yemen® As regards Italian intrigues in Saudi Arabia, he would be very grateful for any information we could give him* I said that this might be difficult,-43- since one might knew that propaganda was going on and money being spent, when it was nevertheless not possible to quote chapter and verse# With regard to Ibn Saud T s suggestion that we should reach some understanding with Ibn Srud with regard to possible Italian activities in the Yemen, I explained that the position was that His Majesty’s Government desired to see Saudi Arabia strong and independent, and to sec the independence of the Yemen equally maintained* This principle underlay the /nglo-Ital- ian Understanding of 1927, the substance of which had already been corammicet'.d to Ibn Sand, by which Great Britain and Italy recognised their mutual interest in seeing the independence of the Arab kingdoms maintained, and mutably renounced any intention of establishing themselves on the Arabian coast of the led Sea- Italy was thus bound by an understanding with His Majesty’s Government not to establish herself in the Yemen, and she would hardly be likely to violate that understanding unless as part of some major dispute, which would turn not on local Arabian but on major Aurcpean political issues. Whatever one might think of the value of Italian promises - regarding v/hich one might well be sceptical - there could clearly be no question of His Majesty’s Government reaching an understanding with Ibn Saud which would be ba«ed on the assumption that a friendly European Power was about to violate an undertaking which it had assumed towards this country# 9» ihe Minister, after some conversation in Arabic with M, iada, replied that Ibn Gaud did not mean an understanding of this kind, but that he merely wished His Majesty’s Government to know that they could rely on him to support them in the event of Italy attempting any adventure in the Yemen in violation of her undertakings. I said that I would record what the Minister had said and submit it forA s\i \ oenside-etion, but I made it clefir thft, while we fully appreciated Ibn Seud’s attitude towards us and the dangers of the situation in the Yemen, we could not proceed, on any assumption that Italy would disregard the Home Under stsnding. 10, The Minister then reverted to the question of Italian propaganda in Iraq? 'but admitted the t King Ihn 3aud had nothing to go cn and was merely puzzled and disturbed by what had recently happened in th?t country, 11 . The upshot of a long end somewhat confusing conversation seemed to be that Ibn Sand wished for seme hind of assurance that we did not regard him as a nuisance; wished to warn us of Italian activities in the Yemen anr’ of the danger threatening from that quarter, which would be greater to him even than to us; and seemed to hope to obtain fromus some kind of undertaking to join with him in resisting any Italian attack on the femen, a suggestion which the Minister abandoned as soon as I i*.a. s * (E 7489/2617/91) -s IMPORTAI^T COImFIDERTIAIj# FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.lo 7th December, 1936. My dear Parkinson, You will remember that there has recently been a good deal of correspondence about Italian activities in the Yemen, and that Mr. Ormsby-Gore recently wrote a private letter to Mr® Eden suggesting (if I remember rightly) that this subject might be dealt with as part of any general Anglo-Italian settlement. 2. I now enclose a copy of a confidential note of a conversation which I had on 25th November with Hope Gill, ^f our Levant Consular Service, which throws further light on the situation in the Yemen and the designs which Italy appears to have on that territory. 3. It has recently been decided here that it would be a mistake to raise this question with the Italian Government at the outset of the impending conversations for a general Anglo-Italian detente ; but the desira bility of trying to secure a revision of the Rome Understanding of 1927, so as to bring it more into line with present conditions, and to make it a more definite guarantee of non-intervention In Arabian affairs, is fully appreciated. Much must, however, depend on the degree of importance which we should attach from tie Imperial point of view to the maintenance of the integrity and independence of the Yemen in all circum stances, and whether or not this object should be regarded as a 'vital' B r itish interest. The question therefore of our future policy towards the Yemen, and that of the possible revision of the Rome UnderstandingO.B ir C. ParKinsori 9 of 1927 ? seem more or less to hang together. 4 0 I have now been instructed to arrange for a preliminary discussion of the whole question to taKe place in the Middle east Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence as soon as possible? and I am therefore writing to you to ash whether you would agree to this, and if so, whether you could arrange with the Secretary to have a meeting of the Sub-Committee called at as early a date as may be convenient to all concerned. If you agree 1 think it would perhaps also be well to circulate to the Committee copies of the recent despatches from Aden on this question^ I am sending a copy of this letter and its enclosi re to b'ebb. Yours sincerely, (Signed) Co W. TiEbDEL©ITALY ADD TH2 Y£AEh. I nad a visit today from Mr. Hope Gill of the Levant Consular service who recently visited the Aden protectorate and the Yemen on his way hack to Lngland from Abyssinia. I understand that he spent some time travelling through the Yemen and staying at Sanaa, and, as he knows Arabia well and speaks Arabic fluently, his impressions are of considerable value- 2 0 Mr. Hope Gill emphasised the extreme activity of the Italians in the Yemen. He said there was no doubt that they were pouring money into the country and that Ragheb Bey the Imam’s chief Minister, and the Governors of Taiz and Hodeida were in Italian pay. The Italian authorities in kast Africa are apparently making no secre’t of their anxiety to obtain a footing in the Yemen. Many irresponsible Italians have been talking in this sense for some years, but the present talk is apparently rather more serious and is based, according to Mr. Hope Gill, on the view held by the Italian military, naval and air authorities that it is essential for Italy to have naval and air bases on the Yemeni coast for the protection of Italian East Africa. 3. Mr. Hope Gill said that the Imam was effusively friendly. He appeared to be nervous of Italian activities, but still seemed to be retaining his grip on the country. He also said that the Imam ’ s probable successor. Seif el Islam Ahmed, was particularly friendly, and had charged him with special messages of friend shj.p to His Majesty’s Government which he proposes to deliver shortly, and that he was certainly not in Italian pay or under Italian in fluence. This conflicts with some reports we have recently received about Ahmed. But Mr. Hope Gill felt that the Italian danger was, nevertheless,very acute, since he con siders that the Italians are suborning all the&gt;^v coastal tribes and in particular the Shafai? who are already on had terms with the Zeidis of the hinterland and who might easily break into open revolt. In that event he considers it possible that the Italians might arrange for the £hafai to invite them to come to their assistance and might thus obtain an excuse for some kind of intervention which they could represent as not being in conflict wioh their obligations under the Rome Understanding* 4 « i had not time to discuss the matter in further detail with hr* Hope Gill&gt; and I understand that he has a good deal more to say on the subject. I therefore hope to get into touch with him again when he promises to show me various notes and documents which he has brought with him* Meanwhile his report seems to me to be of importance and considerably to strengthen the case for attempting to reach an early agreement with the Italians for the revision and strengthening of the Rome Understanding of 1927. 5o Although the Local Italian military and naval authorities would no doubt be most reluctant to abandon their designs on the Yemen, it seems possible that the Government in Rome might be prepared to do so ? as part of an arrangement for bringing about a real detente with this country* 6.&gt; (Mr* Hope Gill is staying until the end of this week at Harewood Court, Hanover Square *- telephone number Mayfair 0441)* (S igned) G* W.

Altnoagh validity of election may be challenged it is expected that he will be generally acknowledged -nd will be strong enough to stifle immediate opposition from his brothers. Ibn el hazir family who are collaterals of Imam and whose most powerful representatives 're Abdullah Governor of ilocieidah, Ali Governor of laiz and hohaimied Governor of Dhamar are deemed disposed to await events in anticipation that Ahmed’s tyrannical polic will provide them with an opportunity to c.isplace nin.

In my opinion British policy should continue to favour preservation of integrity arid independence ol the Yemen and should therefore at present give no encourage ment to opponents of recognised heix. We should however keep on good te^ms with Wazir family without committing ourselves to helping ta_em.

Sir Ronald Graham, GCMG.,GCVO., CB., His Britannic Majesty ! s Ambassador in Rome, and Brigadier-General Sir Gilbert Clayton, KCMG.,KBE.,CB., on behalf of His Britannic Maj esty’s Government, and His Excellency ll Cavaliere Jacopo Gasparini, Governor of Eritrea, and His Excellency 11 Grand'Uff. Raffaele Guariglia, Director-General at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Italian Government. THE above-mentioned delegates have, under instructions from their respective Governments, discussed certain questions regarding British and Italian interests in Southern Arabia ana the Red Sea. The delegates, acting under their instructions that the respective policies of the two Governments in Southern Arabia and/and the Red Sea should be pursued in a spirit of friendly co-operation and developed on parallel though independent lines, have reached the conclusion that their Governments are in agreement on the following points;- 1* That it is in the common interest of the two Governments to pursue a policy of pacification in order to avoid so far as possible conflicts between the various Arab chiefs. 2. That such influence as the two Governments may be in a position to exercise respectively with Ibn Said, the Imam Yahia and the Idrisi of Asir, should be directed towards eliminating causes of conflict in order to arrive, if possible, at pacific and friendly settlements between those chiefs. 3. That while continuing to exert their influence in the cause of peace, the two Governments should not intervene in any conflict which, despite the efforts of the two Governments towards pacification, may break out between these chiefs. 4. That the guiding- principle in British policy in the Red Sea is the Security of imperial communications with India and the East. For this purpose His Britannic Majesty's Government regard it as a vital imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian diore of the Red Sea, and more particularly on Kamaran or the Parsan Islands, and that neither Kamaran nor the Parsan Islands shall fall into the hands of an unfriendly Arab ruler. That, on the other hand, it is the interest of Italy, in view of her possessions on the western coast of the Red Sea, that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea, or on Kamaran or the Parsan Islands, and that neither Kamaran nor the Parsan Islands should fall into the hands of an unfriendly Arab ruler.* 3 . 5. That there should be economic and commercial freedom on the Arabian coast and the islands of the Red Sea for citizens and subjects of the two countries and that the protection which such citizens and subjects may legitimately expect from their respective Governments should not assume a political character or complexion. 6. That the presence of British officials at Kamaran is solely for the purpose of securing the sanitary service ol the pilgrimage to Mecca, but that for administrative reasons His Britannic Majesty^ Government do not consider it possible at present to agree to the Italian request for the participation of an Italian doctor in the quarantine service. But since the Italian Government maintain their point of view in this matter, His Britannic Majesty's Government are disposed to reconsider the question when the number of pilgrims originating in Italian colonies or possessions increases to such an extent as better to justify the presence of an Italian doctor. 7. That it is in the common interest of the two Governments to use their respective influence with the Arab chiefs in such a manner as to safeguard as far as may be possible the mutual interests of Italy and Great Britain, and that, therefore, it is desirable that the two Governments should maintain close touch with each other in all questions affecting the Red Sea and Southern Arabia, in order to avoid misunderstandings between them or misapprehensions on the part of the Arab chiefs in regard to the policies which the two Governments intend to follow in the above-mentioned areas.

Our present information tends to show that any Italian activities in the Yemen, which may have underhand motives, are of a nature designed to avoia detection even to the closest observer as it is well known that the present ruling monarch would deal harshly and summarily with any foreign rs or foreign organisations whose activities were aimed at undermining his authority to the detriment of his State and the future inviolability of his Kingdom. « There is reason, therefore, to believe that Italian methods and practices in the Yemen, to which His Majesty s Government might take exception in certain circumstances are confined to subterranean and secret channels which amount in effect to a form of 'peaceful* penetration and infiltration✓ /? infiltration broijg t about, as far as one can judge, by extensive bribery of tbe highest officials# There is, of course, an ostentatious and superficial side to their activities and this Captain Seager will no doubt report upon in due course# He is now drafting a tneinor&amp;nduin on Italian activities in the Yeraen which is based on the somewhat meagre information at present in our possession# This I hope to be able to forward to :/ou shortly, together with a military report on Yemeni war resources. 4, In my opinion the best way to discover secret Italian activities in the Yemen - and these may well take such root as to present a startling fait accompli in a few years* time or following the present King’s death - is to employ more agents there# This is at present quite impossible on the present monthly grant of Hs#230/- (about at our disposal for Secret Service# These agents would work under the Political Clerk in Kodeida, Salih Ja*far, who has for many years, proved himself to be worthy of trust. 5# I therefore strongly recommend that the grant for Secret Service be increased to $.1000/- (about £106) a month and that sanction for the increase may be given by telegraph so that the necessary arrangements for keeping the desired special and close watch may be made as soon as x&gt;ossible. 6. The amount of the increase required is necessarily only guess work, but I am of ox^inion that half-hearted measures should not be adopted and that it is better to have too much money at one’s disposal for such an important purpose than too little. I should, of course, take care thatthat all expenditure was carefully considered and expended /-». to the hest advantage and It might he possible after a few months trial to fix on a sum somewhat less than that now asked for* 7 # I enclose, for your perusal, a copy of a secret comnuni cation which I received from the Civil Administrator, Kamaran, a few days ago.

V ') J [E 3322/56/25] Copy No. ^ ^ A. Ryan to Mr. Eden.—(Received June 8.) (No. 146. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, May 17, 1936. IN my telegram No. 63 of the 13th May, I had the honour to submit a summary of the account given me by Sheikh Yusuf Yasin of the visit of my Italian colleague to Ibn Saud’s camp at Ashaira on the 10th May and of what passed between M. Persico and the King. I do not think it necessary to send you a full record of my conversation with Sheikh Yusuf, but I may supplement my telegram by mentioning three points of some importance which I omitted from it, as follows :— (a) My Italian colleague, according to Sheikh Yusuf, began his statement to the King by thanking him for having observed neutrality in the Italo- Abyssinian war and for not having taken part in sanctions. The King replied that he had adopted his attitude for the sake of friendship with all concerned. (b) M. Persico stressed the friendly dispositions of his Government towards the Arab nations and their readiness to give any required assurances in this respect. (c) At the end of the private conversation, in which the sheikh engaged me after he had carried out his instructions to inform me of what had passed at Ashaira, he threw out a question regarding reports that His Majesty’s Government might withdraw from the League of Nations and regarding the consequences of such a step, if it were taken. 2. I did not comment on (a) or (b) above. As regards (c), I took the general line that I knew of no pronouncement by any responsible person which could lend support to the reports in question; that many people, it was true, thought that the League should be reorganised to make it more useful; but that, whatever happened (and no one could foresee what would happen), it would astonish me greatly if Great Britain abandoned or despaired of the League. I adduced various considerations in support of my opinion, making it clear, of course, that I was only expressing my private views as between two friends, in accordance with Sheikh Yusuf’s request. 3. Mr. Philby, who was at Ashaira during M. Persico’s visit, spent the evening at my house on the 13th May. His account of the audience, based on what he had heard from his friends, and possibly from the King himself, was generally similar to that given me by Sheikh Yusuf, though not so complete and more loosely put together. He was even more outspoken than the sheikh about the perturbation caused in the King’s mind by the outcome of the Italo-Abyssinian war. The reason for the King’s reaction was, he said, his concern for British prestige. I could not get him to say definitely why the maintenance of that prestige should interest the King so greatly, but the implications of his language were clearly these : Reliance on Great Britain was the corner-stone of Ibn Saud’s policy. Great Britain had failed to oppose a successful resistance to Italy in the case of Abyssinia and had, in fact, let that country down. How, then, could the King have confidence in the will or ability of His Majesty’s Government to resist Italian ambitions in the Red Sea? Like Sheikh Yusuf, Mr. Philby spoke particularly of the Yemen, saying that, when referring to the intended negotiations between Italy and the Yemen, my Italian colleague had spoken of a “ strengthening ” of the relations between the two countries. 4. Mr. Philby is, as you are aware, not in the innermost secrets of Ibn Sand, and his language is very apt to be coloured by his personal sentiments. Nevertheless, I think that what he told me on the 13th May faithfully represents [731 h—2] 9JUL 19362 Ibn Saud’s present outlook. The King watches, as best he can, events in Euiope. but he has little true comprehension of them, much less of such concepts as that of collective security or any sort of security upheld by moral force. He has little real interest in Abyssinia, and has seen in the recent conflict not so much a wai between Italy and an African Power as a struggle between Italy and breat Britain. He sees in the result a sweeping victory for Italian force in this sti uggle. Obsessed, as he has been for years, with the fear of Italian ambitions in the ffed Sea, he fears that that force may in the future be turned against the Aiabian Peninsula. As a Moslem ruler still engaged in consolidating his position m Arabia and jealous of his hardly-won independence, he has no genuine love for Great Britain, a Power which blocks his way in various directions, m the east and south of the peninsula, but he has much less to fear from British policy on this side of it than he thinks he has to fear from that of Italy. 5. The only fortunate feature of this is that Ibn Sand probably believes that it was not so much the ability as the will to save Abyssinia that was wanting in the attitude of His Majesty’s Government as conceived by his simple mi nd. He probably still believes that a breach with them would be fatal to him, and hopes against hope that they would see him through in the event of a breach between him and any other European Power. He dare not go against Great Britain. He dare not offend Italy. Neutrality ’ is more than ever his slogan, because, as I have said, he has seen not a war in Africa, but a conflict, not yet ended, between Great Britain and Italy. He does not yet know what its effects in Arabia may be. and it is with reference to this struggle that he clings to the slogan. I have, &amp;c. ANDREW RYAN.FOREIGN OFFICE E* 2702/56/25 SECRET S. W. 1. 25th May, 1936. Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to invite a reference to Foi’eign Office letter No.E. 2702/56/25 of 21st May enclosing a copy of Jedda telegram No.63 of 13th May and of Mr. Eden's reply thereto on the subject of Italian relations with Saudi Arabia and the Yemen. 2. Mr. Eden has had under consideration, with reference to Sir Andrew Ryan's telegram No.63, the possibly increasing danger of Italy embarking on some new adventure in the Yemen. Although the balance of probability still seems to be against Italy attempting further acts of aggression in this area, the danger of her doing so clearly cannot be altogether excluded and it therefore seems desirable that every effort should be made to obtain a regular and rapid supply of such information as may be available which may have any bearing on the question. 3. I am accordingly to suggest, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies that the Resident at Aden might usefully be instructed to keep a special watch on the situation, and to report by telegraph at frequent intervals whether there are any signs of increasing Italian activity in South West Arabia. 4. Possibly Sir B. Reilly may even consider it desirable that a special officer should be sent to the Yemen to observe and report on any developments in this direction. 5.

My telegram No.57 My Italian colleague visited Ibn Saud at his camp up country on May 10th in accordance with an arrangement of which Yusuf Yasin had previously informed me privately. Ostensible object was merely to pay respects as owing to his recent absence he had not seen the King for a long time. The King had agreed to audience only after repeated requests. Arrangements were those usual in the case of formal /grp. omtd^/ in occupied parts of Abyssinia before pilgrimage and of happy future awaiting Moslems there; of Italian misgivings about Saudi-Iraq Treaty (see my telegram No.55); of offer of aircraft which he again described as wholly disinterested; and of proposed renewal of Italo-Yemen Treaty. The King replied politely but in general terms only on the first and fourth subjects. He repeated what Yusuf Yasin had already said about Saudi-Iraq Treaty. to Yusuf Yasin regarding abolition of Ethiopian Empire and Italian annexation of Al^ssinia. Yusuf Yasin enquired as to object and character of communication. He said that if it had Yusuf Yasin has given me an account of what passed. Italian Charge d»Affaires spoke of facilities afforded to Moslems My Italian colleague has since made oral communication any object other than to convey general information Saudi- Arabian Government could not concern themselves in any way with the consequences of a war in which they had declared neutrality.2. He expects written confirmation of Italian communication. Yusuf Yasin invited my comments. I expressed personal views of the obvious nature on my Italian colleague's visit to the King and the subjects he had mentioned. As regards later Italian communication about Abyssinia I expressed opinion that any Power which had previously recognised Ethiopian Empire would be well advised even if not a member of the League of Nations to avoid any hasty recognition of Italian annexation. Yusuf Yasin said that his Government entirely shared this view. In still more private and personal conversation as between friends Yusuf Yasin again voiced the King's fears of Italian policy in Red Sea and possible aggression against the Yemen. I expressed generally reassuring views.» &gt;; y t ■ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS ^Rl'TA^NIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). April 14, 1936. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4.

THE UNDER SECRETARY OP STATE, INDIA OFFICE.e ^1 the agz*eed record of the Anglo-Italian conversationa at Home in 1927# in which it is laid down that 'fiis Britannic Majesty’s aorernment regard it as a vital Imperial interest that no European power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red ,&gt;ea... That# on the other hand# it is in the interest of Italy# in view of her possessions on the western coast of the Red yea# that no -uropean power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red cea...' If Italy were to occupy Sheikh .Aid or any other part of the :;Yemeni coast# whether by arrangement with the King of the Yemen or by force of arms# she would therefore have committed a breach of an agreement entered into with His Majesty’s Government. - The effect of this would be to create not a merely local problem but a majorinformation which leads them to suppose that Italy in fact contemplates any occupation of Yemeni territory, uich evidence as they possesi of the views of the Italian dove ment tends on the contrary to show that they continue to attach particular importance to the preservatior of the territorial integrity of .Saudi Arabia and the Yemen • 4* At the same time rumours have recently been current that His Majesty’s Government themselves contemplate the occupation of sheikh &gt;ald. lliese rumours are 9 of course, entirely without foundation, but their existence obliges me to furnish you with certain explanations in regard to the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards this piece of territory, which, as you are aware, was the subject of special mention in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914' Any occupation of sheikh Bald by His lajesty’s Government would be a breach not only of the engagement which they contracted in 1927 vis k vis the Italian GovernmentGovernment, but alao of the Treaty which they concluded with the King of the Yemen in which provides that the frontier between the Aden Protectorate and the Yemen shall follow for the first part of its course after leaving the sea the boundary line laid down by the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914« If doubts are expressed in any quarter as to the attl tude of His Majesty’s Government, a reference to the 1934 treaty, with the necessary elucidation of the terms of its third article, should be a sufficient answer# bhould, however, the King of the Yemen's fear of an Italian aggresaior on the Yemeni coast lead him to enquire urgently df you what attitude His Majesty's Government would advise him to adopt in such circumstances, you are authorised to inform him that as a result of an agreement concluded between them som years ago the Italian Government and Hie Majesty* Government are under a mutual obligation not to establish themselves on the Arabian shore of the5. It ie understood that requests hare been made by the Italian authorities in Eritrea to the King of the Yeraen for permission to send sick and wounded soldiers from the Italian forces in Eritrea to the Yemeni coast to recuperate. The King of the Yemen has so far refused permission, but the question may arise again at any moment, and in these circumstances Hia Majesty's Government consider that it will be well for you to Inform the King of the feraen, should he seek advice in the matter, what is the position in international law. Under International law there ia no rule forbidding a neutral Power $o allow the entry of the wounded or sick of a belligerent Power into its territory. A neutral Power may grant or refuse such permission, and in fact in the pact such permission has in practice been refused more often than granted. If permission is granted, the wounded and sick must remain on the neutral territory and must there be guarded by the neutral Government, and after they have recoveredrecovered they must be prevented from returning to their home State or rejoining their Corps so that they can again take part in the operations oi war. Vhlle, therefore, the King of the Yemen would be at liberty, under the general principles of international law, to allow wounded and sick from the Italian forces in Kritrea to be brought to the Yemen for recovery, he would be under an obligation to secure that all such wounded and sick remain in the Yemen until the war between Italy and Ethiopia is over. 6. Consideration has also been given to the attitude which should be adopted in the event of an application from the King of the Yemen for the supply of anas or of a request from him for assialince in connection with the fortification of oheikh Said. The present position is that the King of the Yemen is at liberty to purchase arms from private firms in this country, and there is no objection in existing circumstances to his continuing to do In the event of a request from him for .the supply so./7 supply of armaments by His Sajeety'a GoTcrament* you should inform him that it will be necessary to consult His Ala^ebty’s Government before an anwwer is given f and on learning from you of any such request. His Majesty’s Government will consider the matter in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time* V'hile there might be no objection to the supply of armaments to the King of the Yemen which would enable him to ati’engthen his defences, provided that surplus stocks we:e available, you will appreciate that the situation would be entirely different if Italy were to comadt an act of unprovoked aggression against sheikh ^aid or other parts of the Yemeni coast* The supply to the Yemeni Government of arms which would be immediately used against Italian troops would raise issues of major importance to Anglo-Italii relations, and obviously the most careful consideration in the light of all the circumstances prevailing at the time would be necessary before any decision could be reached7. In the event of a request hy the King of the Yemen for advice as to the beat method of fortifying the Yemeni coast. His .ajesty’s Government see no objection to giving further advice such as has already been given by Captain feager to the local Yemeni authorities if they ask for it. They consider it Important, however, that nothing should be said to the King or the Yemeni authorities which would in any way give the impression that His Majesty’s Gove ximent were accepting any responsibility for the defences of the Yemen or that they were anxious to see those defences strengthened. I have, etc/ YSMST_- SHEIKH SA t IT.)o THE SUB-COMMITTEE had under consideration the following paper:- M.Ec(C) 199 - (i) Letter from the British Resident at Aden to Sir Cosmo Parkinson (Colonial Office)- (ii) Letter from the Air Ministry to Sir Cosmo Parkinson. (iii) Extracts from Secret Political Intelligence Summaries dated 2nd October^ 9th October and 16th October 3 1955. THE CHAIRMAiT explained that as the question of Sheikh Sa’id affected so many departments, he thought it could most conveniently be dealt with at a meeting of the Sub committee. He suggested that tne main points for the Sub-Committee to consider and, if possible, decide upon, were:- (l) The British Government's policy regarding Sheikh Sa' id. (s) Sir Bernard Reilly's question regarding Anglo- Yemeni co-operation, more particularly in regard to the supply of arms. (3) The question raised in the Air Ministry letter regarding the attitude of Great Britain if the Italians forcibly occupied Sheikh Sa : id or any other part of the Yemen. Dealing with the question of policy, MR. CGwELL said that the Colonial Office were of opinion that so long as the Imam held Sheikh Sa'id there was no objection to his fortifying that place. They would, however, oppose occupation by any European Power. He considered that we should reply to Sir Bernard Reilly that His Majesty's Government would oppose any concessions in the Sheikh Sa'id area by the Imam to a European Power. The draft Treaty which Sir Gilbert Clayton had tried, though without success, to induce the Imam to accept, had laid down that the Imamshould not alienate territory to a foreign Power, and., although no such provision appeared in the Treaty actually concluded with the Imam, that principle still remained part of tne Policy of His Majesty’s Government. THE CHAI.'Ri'IAN remarked that the following statement in oir Bernard Reilly’s letter appeared to accord with our policy regarding Sheikh Sa’id:- we do not seek to acquire it for ourselves, hut wish it to go into the possession of any ocner European Power, and for this reason we v/ish the Yemen to retain it, as in former days we wished Turkey to do so.“ MR« REjTDEL said tnat the foreign Office would certainly not wish to see Sheikh Sa’id fall into the hands or any other Power. In practice the only Power likely to tnreaten Sheikh Sa’id at present was Italy. But Itcly had already entered into a formal engagement with us iu 19^7 (the so-called 'Rome Understanding', see foreign Office print No. E 1369/B2/91 of 1927, circulated to the meeting) by which she recognised and accepted the prin ciple that it was a vital British Imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea. Any attempt on Italy’s part to occupy Sheikh Sa’id would therefore be a direct violation of this undertaking towards us. Italy had frequently invoked the Rome Understanding in recent years, and there were reliable indications that she even now attached more importance to the principle laid down in it of the main- ♦ tenance of the independence and integrity of such Arab States as Saudi Arabia and the Yemen, and to tne exclusion oi British domination on any part of the Arabian coast of the Red Sea, than to attempting to acquire a precarious foothold there herself. But the important point was tnat—3- / if Italy did attempt to establish herself at Sheikh Sa’id or elsewhere in the Yemen, she would he violating a formal international engagement to His Majesty’s Government on a matter specifically stated to concern vital British Imperial interests, so that the question would not he merely a local one hut would automatically became a major Anglo- Italian issue, which would have to he dealt with in the light of the European and not merely of the local Arabian situation. from the local point of view there would of course he no objection to our encouraging the Imam to turn the Italians out provided this did not precipitate hostilities between the Italians and ourselves. But as the Imam appeared to he on had terms with the Italians, there should he little need to encourage him to do this. If the Italians were to establish themselves in the Yemen against the wishes of the Imam, they would he committing sin act of aggression against an independent State; and although in this case the State would not he a Member of the League, such an act of aggression would no doubt fall to he dealt with at Geneva under the appropriate Article of the Covenant, and would thus again become a European rather than a purely Arabian question. If, in spite of all this, Italy were to violate the Rome Understanding and try to establish herself at any point on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea, a further effect would presumably be to release us from our self-denying obligations under that understanding vis-a-vis the Italians - a result which the Italians v/ould certainly be anxious to avoid. In reply to a question by the Chairman, Mr. Rendcl said that he saw no need to inform the Imam that we had no intention of occupying sheikh Sa’id. we had signed a formal Treaty with the Imam under which we recognised Sheikh Sa’idas Yemeni territory. To say that we had no intention of violating that Treaty hy occupying some particular point in Temeni territory, such as Sheikh Sa’id, might only cast doubt on the value of the Treaty and suggest that, in other circumstances, we might indeed be ready to violate it. If any statement of our policy was required, it would perhaps be best to follow as closely as possible the wording of the relevant part of the Rome Understanding and say that His Majesty’s Government regarded it as a vital Imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea, adding that the Italian Government had formally recognised and accepted this prin ciple. THE CHAIRMAN asked whether it could be held that legally the Imam had succeeded to the Turkish obligations regarding the ’’yellow patch”, referred to in Article S of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. MR. RENDEL said that the Imam had always refused to recognise any international obligations entered into by the Turks in respect of the Yemen. Although those obliga tions were probably binding on him in international lav/, we had acquiesced in his view to the extent of concluding with him in 1934 a new Treaty which, in fact, replaced and superseded the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. It would, therefore, not be practical politics to go back to the Imam on the question of the so-called “Yellow Patch”. MR. COWELL then drew attention to the fact that the Italians had asked the Imam for permission to send sick and wounded to Mocha.n / ‘in im. REl'TDEL suggested that Sir Bernard Reilly should he informed that this v/ould not he in accordance with inter national practice® He read an extract from Oppenheim’s International Lav/* 5th iidition* 1935* Volume II* page 559, referring to Article 14 of the Fifth Hague Convention, which he explained merely defined the existing and generally recognised position. The purport of this was that while neutral powers might grant the passage of wounded through their territory, any combatants, and the conveyances and personnel accompanying them must remain in neutral tenitory and not rejoin their corps. The Imam would he acting in an un-neutral manner if he allowed his territory to oe used as a clearing station for Italian wounded. If he granted such permission, the Italian personnel would nave to remain in Yemeni territory until the end of the Italo-Lthiopian war. MR. CO'WEIjL agreed that it was important that Sir Bernard Reilly should he well posted with this information in order that he might advise the Imam as to the position in international law. WIUu- COMMANDER ITRIn said that whilst the Air Ministry did not wish to see Sheikh Sa r id fall into the hands of any other Power* they considered that the Imam should he responsible for its defence. we should, however, let him know that we were not less anxious than he was to see the Italians kept out. MANOR OSBORNS said that the War Office agreed with the Air Ministry view. He asked whether the question was not already covered by an Italian Treaty v/ith the Imam of 19&amp;6* MR. REND EL agreed that this was so but said the Treaty could not be relied upon. -5“In reply to the Chairman, MR. BLAXTBR said the Colonial Office had information that the Italians v/ere sending a delegation to Sanaa with a view to negotiating the renewal of this Treaty. MR. SEAL said that from the Admiralty point of view Sheikh Sa’id was important as commanding the otraits of Bab-el-Mandeb. There was no harbour. They supported the views expressed at the meeting on the undesirability of Sheikh Sa'id falling into the hands of a European Pov/er. MR. CLAUSON said the India Office were not concerned in this question except in so far as it affected British policy in the Red oea regarding the security of Imperial communications with India and the East. They agreed with the statement of policy in Sir Bernard Reilly’s letter s to which the Chairman had referred. In reply to a question by Mr. Seal* who pointed out that it might conceivably be held that Sheikh Sa’id was not on the ’’Arabian shore of the Red Sea” as in the Rome Understanding 3 since it was actually on a peninsular dividing the Red Sea from the G-ulf of Aden* MR. RENDER said that he thought that any place on the Yemeni side of the frontier could be regarded as on the Arabian shore of the Red Sea, and therefore as covered by the Rome Understanding. In reply to a question by the Chairman regarding French interests in Sheikh Sa’id, MR. MALCOLM said that the French had at one time claimed the place on the grounds that it had been purchased from an Arab Sheikh by two Frenchmen in 1869, but they had not raised the question since the end of the Great War. In reply to a question by Mr. Clauson, THE CHAIRMAN said that Sir Bernard Reilly would not take action with the Imam unless asked to do so. It would be unnecessary-7- 1 * A to give the Imam the subject matter of the Rome Understanding, in view of our recent Treaty with him. Several of the provisions of the Rome Understanding were now inapplicable and the vital point was that neither we nor the Italians wished to have a European Rower on the Red Sea. We could* however* refer to the Rome Understanding in a general way and inform the Imam that for some time there had been an understanding between ourselves and the Italians on this question. MR# REJTDEL agreed with this view. THE CHAIRMAN then raised the question of British assistance to the Imam* including the supply of arms. WING COiBLINDER PIRIE said the Air Ministry considered that whilst we should be willing to assist the Imam* we should not give him the impression that we were ready to undertake the defence of oheikh Sa’id. The Air Ministry considered that the Imam should be permitted to purchase arms and ammunition if necessary* say in an emergency* from Aden * and v/e should also be prepared to advise him on the lay-ouc of his defences. THE CHAIRMAN said he understood that the Imam was at liberty to purchase arms* etc. * from British firms* but that there was no question of such arms being sold to him by His Majesty's Government. MR. RENDER was of opinion that there was no reason why the Imam should not buy arms from the British Govern ment* as Ibn Baud had been permitted to do* but if per mission were granted it should first be clear that we were not committing an act of war against Italy. If the Italians had not committed an aggression there would be noharm in allowing the Imam to purchase. If* however * Italy had committed an act of aggression and we sold arms 5 we might be regarded by the Italians as allying ourselves to their enemy. Ve should have to consider our policy in the light of the new act of war end it might become a major Anglo-Italian question. In the Saudi-Yemen war we decided not to supply arms to either party. MR. S1AL pointed out that in view of our special interests in Sheikh. 3a’id* which were known to Italy* any aggression on the part of Italy against oheikh Sa’id would at once raise the issue of peace or war. He did not think that the supply of arms to the Yemen v/as a matter of great practical importance* as it v/as inconceivable that the Yemenis alone would be able to resist an Italian attack* even if we did supply them with arms. THE CHAIRMAN suggested that Sir Bernard Reilly should be advised rhat the Imam was at liberty to purchase arms from British firms* but that it might perhaps be better to make no reference to the purchase of arms from the British Government. MR. COWELL thought that Sir Bernard Reilly's instructions might state that unless Italy committed an act of aggression^ the Imam would be free to purchase arms from British firms or from the British Government. In the event* however* of an Italian aggression* Sir Bernard should refer this question to His Majesty’s Government for instructions. MR. BLAXTER said that sometime ago the War Office had informed the Colonial Office that it was not the policy of the British Government to supply arms* except to British Dominions and Colonies.* A, MAJOR OSBORNE said he could not make a definite statement on the War Office policy in this respect. He v/as not sure that this ruling did not apply mainly to rifles. He considered that the Imam v/ould require machine guns and* possibly* artillery. Before the meeting concluded MR. WARD drew attention to a despatcn from Sir Percival Phillips (writing from Aden) in the ’Daily Telegraph* of the 16th November* in which it v/as alleged that the Italians were making use of the coast line of the Aden Protectorate itself * especially the town of Mukalla* for the purpose of smuggling supplies across to Eritrea and getting round the effect of sanctions. The article also referred to the rumours which were circulating locally in the Protectorate about the interest Italy was suddenly taking in the Hadramaut and the coast* and it stated that Italian propaganda was being carried on by agents who had penetrated even as far as Socotra. Although this article was doubtless exaggerated* it did convey the impression that the Italians were taking a close interest in the wilder parts of the Aden Protectorate itself* and this seemed an important development. Mr. Ward recalled that at its meeting on the £lst August last to consider questions of policy in the Hadramaut* the Sub-Committee had come to the conclusion that the possibility of complications with other Powers was one of the reasons which justified a policy of extending British influence and control in the outlying parts of the Aden Protectorate. MR. BIjAXTER undertook to see that Sir Percival Phillips* article was brought to the notice of Sir Bernard Reilly for any comments that he might have to offer. -9-CONCLUblON* THE SUB-GOMITTEE agreed:- To invite the Colonial Office&gt; in consultation with the foreign Office&gt; to draft a despaoch to Bir Bernard Keiliy* British Resident at ^denj, replying to the questions raised in his letter to Sir Cosmo Parkinson, dated *3rd October, 1935, in the light of the discussion at the meeting; and to circula ^ the despatch to the Departments concerned for their official concurrence.

The point at issue - at least primarily - is what reply the Resident should give to a possible request from the Imam for help in fortifying his coastal districts. It is clear that it is most undesirable, from the point of view of Imperial communications, that the Italians should establish a footing at Sheikh Sa f id. Once they had done so, it might be exceedingly av/kward to get rid of them. It seems desirable, therefore, that if the Imam were to request help in obtaining,- say, machine guns for defence purposes, H.M.G. should supply them, preferably against payment. Any attempt on Sheikh Sa’id would of course be in direct opposition to the understanding reached at the Rome Conversations (P.1641/27 in Volume attached) and if there were any occasion for a diplomatic move at Rome, the Conversations would be an appropriate peg to hang them on. But in the absence of any evidence that the Italians have in point of fact any serious designs on this coast, a diplomatic dem arche might be premature and undesirable. It would no doubt be better to let the Italians know by implication - e.g. by our helping the Imam with his defences - that we are prepared to support the Imam against such an attempt. If the Imam were to ask for a statement of H.M.G**s attitude in the event of Italian aggression upon his coasts, it is for consideration v/hether he might not be. X of the Rome Conversations - e.g. that H.M.G. have long regarded it as an important British interest that no European power should establish itself on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea, and that this was made clear to the Italians some years ago. It would obviously be impossible for H.M.G. to say v/hat action they would take in hypothetical contingencies, but a general statement of this kind might reassure the Imam in his dealings with the Italians. It is proposed on Tuesday to take the line (which is presumably the line taken by all other Departments) tha'ji it is vital from the Indian standpoint that the Italians should not obtain a footing at Sheikh Sa’id or elsewhere in the Yemen, and to suoport any measures, such as the supply of arms or assurances to the Imam, or a diplomatic demar che if occasion should offer, v/hich may be under consideration. Much, of course, will turn on the attitude adopted by the Colonial Office, who apart from the Foreign Office are presumably most nearly concerned.

Secretary to the Sub-Committee. 2, Whitehall Gardens, S 0 1 20th November, 1955*I. The Residency, Aden, 23rd October, 1935. My dear Parkinson, The following information may be of interest to you in connection with the present situation here. Seager (who is at the moment acting as political Secretary; was visited a few days ago by a Yemeni from Ta'ia, named Sheikh Saleh Hurub - a close confidant of the 0&lt;&gt; C* Ta’iz, Seiyid Ali bin el Wazir - who told him that he had been asked to call on the Italian Consul. He asked Seager’s advice as to whether he should avail himself of this invitation, Seager replied that, though it was no business of his, he thought Sheikh Saleh might get a line on the Italian Consul and that this might be of interest to the Yemeni Government. Two days later Saleh Hurub visited Seager in his house and passed on the gist of his conversation with Cavaliere Pasqualucci. This conversation it appears was in the form of a cross examination, and the following questions amongst others were put and the answers taken down by the Consul’s clerk (aj Has the Yemeni Government asked the British Government for help, either verbally or in writing? (b; Was the British Government paying out any gold to the Yemenis? (c) as the British Government paying out increased sums of money to the Protectorate tribesmen on the Anglo- Yemeni frontier? (d) Were there any British officers or soldiers in Sheik Sa.'id?I A \ (0) Vas it the British. Government vhich had requested the fortifying of Sheik Sa’id? (f) has the British Government supplying any war material? After replies had been given to these questions my informant was told int er a lia; (1) that the Italians attached great importance to Sheikh Sa ? id c (ii) that the British Government would never dare to interfere, and, moreover, could not, if the Italians had any designs on the Yemen*. I pass this information to you as an illustration of the Italian Consul's activities, and of the interest taken by the Italian Government in Sheikh Sa'id, which overlooks the Straits of Bab el Mandeb and Perim from the Arabian side, As you know, Sheikh 8a'id and the immediately adjacent area formed the '’Yellow Patch/ 5 referred to in Article 2 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914, No reference to it was made in the Treaty of San’a of last year, but presumably our policy with regard to it remains the same as it was in Turkish days, namely that v,e do not seek to acquire it for ourselves, but we do not wish it to come into the possession of any other European Power-*, and for this reason we wish the Yemen to retain it, as in former days we wished Turkey to ao so. The Italians on the other hand evidently believe that we have designs on this strategic point, and they would probably be very glad to acquire it themselves. Their suspicion of Anglo-Yemeni co-operation in this area is interesting, and is indicative of the growing change in the relations of theths Imam was inclined to rely on Italian help to protect him against the supposedly aggressive objects of the British,, T - T e has now far more confidence in us 9 and the Italians’ aggression against Ethiopia has gone far to transferring his suspicions to thenio inese developments may tend to accelerate the process of strengthening our ties with the Yemen? and of so bringing it into a British rather than an :talian orbite I am not disposed to press forward the Anglo-Yemeni rapprochement too rapidly, and at present we at Aden are limiting ourselves to giving the Yemenis good advice when ashed for (as, for example, recently about the defences of Sheikh 3a’id), and to cultivating the good neighbourly relations that have existed since the signing of the Treaty. On the other hand, if the alarm that now exists in the Yemen with regard to Italian designs against Sheikh Sa'id and the adjacent Yemen coast, including Mocha, continues, it is possible that the I'ing of the Yemen will make further and more direct overtures for British help in fortifying and protecting his coastal districts against Italian intrusion. Should this happen I shall of course report to you olficially, and shall not commit myself in any way without instructions. I mention the possibility now as I should be glad to know your general views with regard to the attitude that we should adopt in the event of Yemeni suggestions for closer co-operation with us, and especially of requests for our help in obtaining armaments.

Dear Parkinson, Tlie following is an extract from a letter we have received from Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, subsequent to the visit which he paid to Aden towards the end of October ''''here is a certain amount of excitement about the Yemen at Aden. As you doubtless know the Italians have asked tne Imam to allew them to send sick and wounded to Mocha. The Imam has so far refused but he has indicated to Reilly that he would like to know what would be the attitude of Great Britain if the Italians [ use force. Reilly expects to have a very definite question on this subject sent to him by the Imam in ohe near future. I don't know what the answer is. V/e certainly don't want the Italians there and it would he very awkward if they occupied Sheikh Sa'ud, which is the Peninsula at the extreme Southern end of the Red Sea on the Arabian side. Guns mounted here and at one corner of Rritrea could make exit from the Red Sea very uncomfortable.

Report 'by Captain Seager, Frontier Officer in the Aden Protectorate. Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. SEEJN political committee 22 nd flovember 1935• Previous papers :— Captain Seager^ report contains valuable information on the domestic situation in the Yemen. Cross currents of hatred and jealousy between the leading personalities: Abdulla al Amri, the virtual dictator of the country; his colleague, Raghib Bey, the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; the presumptive Crown Prince; and the powerful Wazir family, are perhaps a normal feature of any Oriental despotism and might lead to a series of Palace revolutions which would not have much effect on the world at large. However, the possibility that the civil servants are in the pay of Italy and the efforts of the Y/azir Family to enlist British support remove these quarrels from the entirely domestic sphere and may give rise to international/ 3330 1000 12.34international complications. A further disturbing feature is the latent hostility between the tribesmen and the Zeidi element which at the moment is the backbone of the administration. If this animosity were allowed full play, civil disturbances would result which might cause complete disintegration of the Yemen. 2. For the moment the prestige rather than the personality of the Imam is sufficient to keep these discordant elements quiescent, but it is clear that his death will be followed by a period of unrest which would provide a favourable opportunity for intervention on the part of any foreign Power who desired to take advantage of it. (Sgd.) HOOD 4/11. It is a pity that Sir Bernard Reilly does not commit hi mself ‘ in his covering despatch to any expression of opinion on the main points dealt with by Captain Seager (who has only been a year or two in S.W. Arabia) - e.g. the extent of Italian influence - at San 1 a. He said a year ago (paragraph 39 of his despatch at P.Z. 2248/34) that this influence was much exaggerated - and even if it has been considerably strengthened since then it is no doubt exceedingly unlikely that the Yeminis would in present circumstances do anything to encourage Italian penetration. It is to be hoped that the Iman will survive until conditions are more stable in that part of the worldl Though, if he does not, his country is no doubt quite as likely to he absorbed by Ibn Saud as by the Italians - who presumably will not be able to add to their commitments for several years.

TliliSALGE visited PERIM for a few hours on loth February, while conveying the SA f NA Mission to ADEN, and the o portunity was taken of discussing the matter with Mr. C.O. DAYEY, the ; Gk&gt;v ernment Ajen t. 3 . Mr# Davev states that although he was informed by the London Offices of the ^erim Coal Company that the Italian surveying ship 'AMMIRALGLIO MAGh T AGH^ ,, would visit PERIM for coal during December, 1933, she has not yet been in the port. 3. On 13th January, the Italian sloop 'OSTIA' arrived and embarked oil fuel'. Mr. Javey called, and was requested by the Commanding Officer to allow officers to land at the KIGrB LIGHT for the pur ose of taidng a round of angles of peaks on the Arabian coast, including, presumably, the vicinity of SHEIKH 3STD. This permission was granted. Jubsequently mr. Davey was informed by the Island golioe that the officers, after makin; their^ observations at the HIGH LIGHT, descended to the OLD LIGHT on OBSTRUCTION POINT and there made sketches. I 4. It is understood that these sketches were also of the Arabian coastline, but time did not admit of this being confirmed. H.M#3. PENMANCE will therefore call at PERIS on her return passage from DJIBOUTI, when the oliee officers coneemed^will be interviewed. 5. Mr. Davey was informed that 'OSTIA' will c 11 for fuel at monthly intervals until May, when she is expected to return to ITALY, He also gathered that 'AMMIRA&amp;IG MAONAGRI' is engaged in survey work in the vicinity of A3SAB. 6 . In the event of further requests to land for graphical purposes being made on any future occasion Javey proposed that permission should a careful watch being kept proposed that permission should again oe granted, (watch being kept on the movements of the observers, and a report forwarded. 7. These proposals were discussed with and concurred in by the Chief Commissioner, ADEN, in view of the following facts - (a) Details of PEEIM island and the neighbouring Arabian coast are already snown in considerable JU^ail on Admiralty chart Ho .3592 'xERIM Island and DAB-EL-MAN DEB Small Strait.'2 . (bj i'iothin^ of a secret nature exists in BEBIM. (c) It is impossible to detect or prevent any scotching or-photography that a forei^ man-of-war may undertake v/hile on'passage thro%h the omall Strait or elsev/here in the vicinity of the Island. (d) ihe difficulties which would attend the refusal of-permission after having wanted it on a previous occasion. 8 . In a general consideration of this incident, it will be recollected that the vicinity of SIIBIKK SETD has always received the particular and sensitive attention of His Majesty’s Government, owing to its dominant position with regard to iEBIM and the Straits. In the • nglo-Turkish Boundary Agreement of 1904-5, this area was known as ’The yellow patch'* on the map.a special clause providing that on no account would TURKEY alienate her tenure of it in favour of any other Power. 9* Prom intercepted w/T messa -os eu claim it now appears certain that both 'AilllHAUL 10 MGfcAGfil' and 'OSTIA” are engaged in some work (presumably survey) in the ASSAB- THIO area, and that a shore observation party, eauipped with a portable ' 7 T set has been landed. The sloop 'ASIO” also an rears to be taking part in the operations. It is hoped that further information as to this activity will be obtained,during the forthcoming visit of 0.3. PEKZAUGE to ASSAB ( 6 th - 9th March]. ^10. The only other foreign v/arships who have visited PEEIM since 1 st January. 1934, were the Butch destroyers ”BANKER!” and '/AN NE83 ft , who called on 8th-9th January, outward bound. (3d.) R.H.
