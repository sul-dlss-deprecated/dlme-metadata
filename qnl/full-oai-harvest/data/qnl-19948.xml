Hennell states that as he was unable to assemble an imposing naval force, he sent a communication to Sheik Yoosoof ben Moobaruk, Chief of Nabend, requesting that he settle the matter by paying the moderate sum of 80 tomans. Hennell reports that the Sheik of Nabend has denied that his people have committed any piracy and has claimed that the accusation was raised by his enemy, Sheik Houssein ben Jubbarah, Chief of Congoon. Hennell states that he has corresponded with the Sheik of Congoon's deputy, and has asked for the crew of the plundered boat to be sent to Bushire to give evidence. The letter concludes with Hennell remarking that the indifference shown by the Sheik of Congoon scarcely entitles him to British interference on his behalf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051546.0x00005a#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
