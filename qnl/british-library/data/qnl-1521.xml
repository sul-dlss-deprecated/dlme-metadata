FOLLOWING from acting consul at Shiraz :— “ I have received telegrams from Manchester and Bombay begging protection for agents of certain British firms ; also from Armenian archbishop recommending to me Christian community. “ Except in case of those who can thoroughly establish their right, granting of flags seems to involve too heavy responsibility, and if Persian soldiers are provided for any but Europeans they would be first to pillage. “ I am writing, as only measure offering some prospect of success, to all Arab chiefs informing them in detail what houses are inhabited by British subjects or ■protegee, and urging them, in the event of fighting in neighbourhood of these, to ensure that they be respected and to do all in their power to safeguard non-Mussulman population. I am also obtaining from Kawam instructions to same effect. This step, inadequate as it is, seems only one possible, and I fear that I am unable to give more than vaguest comfort to those applicants as well as to British subjects, whose interests I am by no means in a position to protect.” I have replied as follows :— “ British subjects and bond fide agents of British firms who have Biitish-owned goods on their premises may fly flag, but no others. ^ I approve your communication to Arab chiefs. (Telegraphic.) SITUATION at Shiraz. No. 2. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 2.) Tehran, October 2, 1911.

It is urgently necessary in any case that 300 men should be dispatched to Shiraz.” Following is my reply :— “ You can tell Soulet from me that unless he immediately removes himself and his men from the neighbourhood I shall recommend my Government to take immediate steps to protect our interests, and to visit the penalty for any damage to these directly upon himself and Nizam. “You can also warn Arab chiefs that I shall recommend my Government to take steps to exact full reparation for any harm to British lives and property.” I have also again drawn attention of Persian Government to the menacing situation, and urged them to warn the various chiefs of the necessity of preventing harm to British subjects. No. 3. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 3.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, October 3, 1911. SITUATION at Shiraz. In continuation of my telegram of the 2nd October, I have the honour to repeat following personal telegram which Lieutenant Wilson, who is now at Shiraz, has addressed to His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire :— “ I fully share acting consul’s view of seriousness of situation. We both’ concur in thinking that matters have now reached a stage when it is doubtful that even the strongest warning would serve any purpose, and I think that Europeans do undoubtedly stand in serious danger. “ There appears to me no possibility of things settling down.” I submit that the 300 men destined, if our scheme is approved, for Shiraz and Ispahan should be dispatched without delay and the fact made public forthwith. Such a step is justified independently of the roads by the situation at Shiraz. No. 4. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) YOUR telegram of 2nd October Your action is approved. Shiraz.

ESCORT reinforcements. Reference to my telegram of the 6th October. Acting Consul Knox telegraphs as follows :— “I venture to urge very strongly that no delay should occur in dispatching reinforcements. Winter sets in after the end of November, and lack of supplies will0 s am, k| d Bek wliile. then render the road impassable for 200 men. Furthermore, it will be impossible to ensure winter supplies for men and horses here unless local action is taken immediately if, as appears extremely probable, there will shortly be a great scarcity. “ Situation continues to be very strained, and I think general disorders are impending on the roads. This afternoon some inhabitants of suburb fired on Kawam as he was leaving the consulate and killed some of his men. It is not improbable that further trouble in the town may arise out of this incident.” I do not think there should be any delay in dispatch of reinforcements in view of above telegram. Subject to your approval, I would propose following wording for my communica tion to the Persian Government:— In consequence of the general disorder prevailing in Southern Persia, His Majesty’s Government have decided to increase the British consular escorts at places where British trade interests require temporary protection. These escorts will be occasionally employed for the protection of British caravans. These reinforcements will be withdrawn as soon as a gendarmerie adequate for the protection of the southern trade routes has been organised by the Persian Government. I would propose to make this communication to Persian Government as soon as I receive your authorisation to do so. Persian Government have already learnt that our scheme has appeared in the press from their Minister in London. No. 17. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 7.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, October 7, 1911. PERSIAN Government have now appointed Ala-ed-Dowleh Governor-General of Ears in the place of Farman Farma, who made difficulties about proceeding to Shiraz. Deputy governorship has been entrusted to Kawam, who has left the consulate. Acting consul is assured by Kawam that he will forthwith send the more unruly tribesmen in charge of his son to a distance of 50 miles from the town, and that he will keep only those in whom he has confidence. Colonel Cox, who I gather has been consulted by the Government of India respecting the immediate need for British troops, has replied urging their immediate dispatch in the interests of security of British subjects and merchandise as well in Shiraz as on the roads. Adverting to Kawam’s departure from the consulate, he says that this relieves anxiety on the score of the safety of the consulate, but there is no ground for supposing that it will lead to a restoration of order and security in Shiraz. He adds : “ Nizam and Soulet have withdrawn a few miles solely in consequence of our definite threat and of the rumours of our preparations to carry it out. Latter, however, is unlikely, even were Nizam to leave Fars willingly, to retire from an active role in the province, and if we fail to carry out our decision, which is now generally known, forces of disorder will gain a new impetus, and the damaging impression that theie is no fear of our carrying our decision into effect will be revived. I he state of the roads is worse than ever hitherto.” No. 18. Mr. O’Beirne to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 7.) (Telegraphic.)

Aide-memoire communicated to Mr. O’Beirne by M. Neratof. PAR son aide-memoire datedu 13 (26) courant, 1’Ambassade ,de la Grande-Bretagne a bien voulu communiquer an Ministere Imperial des Affaires Etrangeres le projet du Cabinet de Londres de creer un vice-consulat a Bam et d’augmenter I’effectif des escortes des consulats britanniques a Bouchir, Chiraz, Kerman et Bender-Abbas, ainsi que du consulat anglais a Ispahan, si toutefois ]e Gouvernement russe n’y avait pas d’objections, etant donne que cette derniere ville se trouve dans la sphere d’influence russe. Le Gouvernement Imperial apprecie a leur juste valeur les considerations qui ont amend le Cabinet de Londres a recourir a la mesure dont il s’agit et declare n avoir aucune objection au renforcement de 1’escorte consulaire anglaise a Ispahan. De son cote, le Gouvernement Imperial est egalement preoccupe de letat d’insecurite generale qui regne non seulement dans la region entre Ispahan et Teheran, qui a ete tout dernierement encore le theatre degressions reiterees de la part de bandes de brigands, mais encore dans les provinces du nord de la Perse, on les troubles, qui avaient commence a se calmer en presence des troupes russes, reprennent leur essor. Neanmoins, le Gouvernement russe ne voudrait en aucun cas recourir, sans y etre absolument force par les circonstances, a I’envoi de nouvelles troupes en Perse, ainsi que cela avait lieu en 1909 ; mais, si les troubles continuent a se propager, il se verra probablement oblige de renforcer egalement les escortes de quelques-uns de ses consulats du nord de la Perse, ainsi que celle d’Ispahan, afin d’assurer les communications et le commerce russe entre cette ville, d’un cote, et Teheran et Chiraz, de I’autre. Le Gouvernement Imperial aime a esperer que le Cabinet de Londres voudra bien le tenir au courant des demarches ulterieures qu’il compte entreprendre dans la presente affaire. Saint-Petersbourg, le 23 septembre, 1911. (Translation.) IN a memorandum dated the 13th (26th) instant the British Embassy was good enough to communicate to the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs the proposal, of the Cabinet of London to establish a vice-consulate at Bam and to increase the strength of the escorts of the British consulates at Bushire, Shiraz, Kerman, and Bunder Abbas, and also of the British consulate at Ispahan, if the Russian Government had no objection, in view of the fact that this last town is situated in the Russian sphere. The Imperial Government fully appreciate, the considerations which have led the Cabinet of London to resort to the measures in question and state that they have no objection to the reinforcement of the English consular escort at Ispahan. On their side, the Imperial Government are equally concerned at the general state of insecurity reigning not only in the region between Ispahan and Tehran, which has been quite lately the scene of repeated attacks by bands of brigands, but also in the provinces of North Persia, where the disturbances, which had begun to die down owing to the presence of Russian troops, are breaking out again. Nevertheless the Russian Government would not wish, unless they were absolutely compelled by circumstances, to resort to the dispatch of fresh troops to Persia, as in 1909 ; but if the disturbances continue to spread they also will probably be obliged to reinforce the escorts of some of their consulates in North Persia, as vcell as that at Ispahan, in order to secure communications and Russian trade between that town on the one side and Tehran and Shiraz on the other. The Imperial Government hope that the Cabinet of London will be good enough to keep them informed of any further steps which they intend to take in the matter. St. Petersburgh, September 23, 1911.Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, OctoberS, 1911. YOUR telegram of 7th October : Indian troops for Shiraz. You should confine your announcement to the Persian Government to a simple statement that, owing to possible danger to British lives and properties at Shiraz and elsewhere, His Majesty’s Government are compelled to strengthen the consular guards at Shiraz and possibly also at Ispahan and Bushire. You should say nothing as to patrolling roads or escorting caravans. No. 20. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edioard Grey.—(Received October 8. ) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, October 8, 1911. ESCORT reinforcements. A member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs visited me yesterday, and urgently begged me on behalf of the Minister to advise His Majesty’s Government to abandon intention of increasing consular escorts at Bushire, Shiraz, Ispahan, Bunder Abbas, and Kerman, which had been reported in the British press. He urged that since my note of the 14th October last year Persian Government had made every effort to improve matters, but their energies had been diverted to the suppression of the insurrection. Pie begged us still to have patience, more especially in view of the improvement of the situation at Shiraz and the appointment of Ala-ed-Dowleh as Governor-General of Ears. I replied that the state of the southern roads had been, even before the ex-Shah’s return, more insecure than ever, that the three main channels of our trade with Persia had been for some time practically closed, and that, though I believed no decision had been taken, I had recommended a scheme for increasing certain British consular escorts with a view to protecting British lives and trade independently of the situation at Shiraz. Scheme was now under consideration. He asked me how the escorts could protect trade, and I replied that they might occasionally be used to escort caravans. Your telegram of the 8th October reached me after I had drafted above. Am I now authorised to make official communication to Persian Government on the lines indicated in your instructions ? I await announcement that dispatch of troops has been definitely decided upon before doing so. No. 21. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, October 9, 1911. YOUR telegram of 5th October. Unless some arrangement satisfactory to the Russian Government can be arrived at we cannot approve of Stokes’s appointment. No. 22. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Foreign Office, October 9, 1911. THE Persian Minister called at the Foreign Office on the 4th instant and. questioned Sir A. Nicolson as to the announcement in the “Times” of that morning in respect to the dispatch of Indian cavalry regiments to Persia. Sir A. Nicolson replied that for some weeks past the situation at Shiraz had been going from bad to worse, while the condition of the whole of southern Persia approached very closely to anarchy. During the last two or three days the position at Shiraz had become really critical, and there appeared to be real danger to the lives of British subjects. We [503] ^ B 4were, therefore, contemplating a considerable and immediate increase to onr consular guard at Shiraz and possibly at one or two other places. We had abstained from taking any such steps as long as possible in the hope that the situation might possibly improve, but our last telegrams were of so alarming a character that we could no longer defer taking measures to protect our own people. Mirza Mehdi Khan asked if we could not give the Persian Government a little more time wherein to organise some protective measures. Sir A. Nicolson replied that we really could not wait longer, as we might be endangering the lives of our subjects; that he did not wish to blame the Persian Government, who doubtless had had to contend with great difficulties, but the case of our people was urgent and pressing, and it would be wrong for us to abstain from giving them such protection as was possible. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. No. 23. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, October 9, 1911. YOUR telegram of 8th October. Persian Minister called here to express hope that His Majesty’s Government would not send increased escort to Shiraz, but leave Persian Government to re-establish order, which they had been hitherto prevented from doing by ex-Shah and other agitators. He was told that His Majesty’s Government appreciated Persian Government’s difficulties, but that latter’s measures in this respect could not be efficacious for some time, and if, in the meanwhile, untoward incidents occurred affecting British lives and property, responsibility of Persian Government would be great, and British public opinion would compel His Majesty’s Government to exact all kinds of reparations and compensations, and His Majesty’s Government would itself be blamed for confiding in Persian assurances. It was therefore in interest of Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government should take steps to accord necessary protection to British lives and property. We had no desire to occupy and no intention of retaining increased consular guards longer than was absolutely necessary. Persian Minister then said his Government’s troubles were due to encouragement and support of ex-Shah by Russians. He was told that if Russians had really done so Persian Government would have found ex-Shah more difficult to deal with than had actually been the case. You should now make official announcement as instructed in my telegram of 8th October. t* litr No. 24. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received October 10.) (Telegraphic.)

Sir 5 Foreign Office, October 12, 1911. I TOLD Count Benckendorff to-day that I recognised the natural objection of Russia to the employment of a British officer to command gendarmerie in the north of Persia, but I pointed out to him that, as the organisation of the gendarmerie would remedy the injury to British trade in Persia, our action in supporting the Russian objection to the employment of Major Stokes ought to be recognised as extremely loyal to the entente. Count Benckendorff admitted the force of this, but told me he gathered from what he heard that M. Kokovtzoff felt that the tout ensemble in Northern Persia was becoming increasingly British. Mr. Shuster seemed to select British p e opln&gt; and an Englishman had been appointed to control the Posts and Telegraphs.

CONVEYS substance of the following despatch, dated the 14th October Sir ’ With reference to your telegram of the 9th instant, I have the honour to transmit herein copy of the note which I addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 10th instant, stating that His Majesty’s Government had decided to increase the guard at His Majesty’s consulate at Shiraz. I also enclose a translation of his Excellency’s reply. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY.10 Enclosure 1 in No. 29. Sir G. Barclay to Vosuk-ed-Dowleh. M. le Ministre, Tehran, October 10, 1911. I HAYE the honour to inform your Excellency, under instructions from His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that, owing to possible danger to British lives and property at Shiraz and elsewhere, His Majesty’s Government are compelled to strengthen the consular guard at Shiraz, and possibly also the consular guards at Ispahan and Bushire. I avail, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 2 in No. 29. Vosuk-ed-Dowleh to Sir G. Barclay. (Translation.) Your Excellency, Tehran, October 11, 1911. I HAYE taken note of the contents of your Excellency’s note of the 10th instant respecting the increase of the consular guard at Shiraz. In reply, I have the honour to state that, as your Excellency is aware, the maintenance of order in the southern provinces and the improvement of affairs in Ears, being the principal matters of concern to the Persian Government, w T ere receiving special consideration. When the Government were taking fresh measures, and were about to succeed in bringing about the improvements in view, the Kawam incident and the taking of refuge by him in the British consulate frustrated this intention. Immediately afterwards, the insur rection of the deposed Shah, Salar-ed-Dowleh, and their followers broke out, and the Government’s efforts had to be directed towards their extermination and the reparation of the mischief caused by them, which was indispensable for public security. The Government were therefore unable to direct their energy, as they wished, towards the settlement of affairs in the south. The money which had been prepared for funda mental reforms, and should have been expended on necessary undertakings, has been misspent. Furthermore, the moral assistance of the British Government, which might have given support to the measures taken by the Persian Government against the deposed Shah, was not forthcoming. Now that the Government are free from embarrassments in the north and west, and are about to direct their attention to the south by employing their whole efforts to restore order and security, the step contemplated by the British Government, which might form a precedent for others, would be extremely unexpected and unwelcome on the part of a friendly Power. The steps contemplated by the Persian Government in regard to Fars, which are communicated for your Excellency’s information, are as follows :— Firstly, order will be given to the Cossack detachment, numbering S50 men (horse, foot, and artillery), now on their way to Kashan, and who left Kum yesterday, to proceed at once to Shiraz after accomplishing their task at Kashan. Secondly, Ala-ed-Dowleh, the new Governor-General of Fars, will shortly leave Tehran for his post, with the necessary force. Thirdly, the Swedish officers, who have been specially engaged by the Persian Government for the organisation of the gendarmerie and the maintenance of security on the roads, are busily engaged, and the result of their work will soon be apparent. A sufficient force for the protection of the southern roads will be sent. Fourthly, the Persian Government have taken steps to bring about a reconciliation between Kawam-ul-Mulk, Soulet-ed-Dowleh, and their followers, whose animosities were chiefly responsible for the complications in Fars, and these steps have now proved entirely successful. I he two persons above named and their followers have resolved to make up their differences, and in accordance with a written agreement, sealed by Mirza Ibrahim Mujtehed, they have undertaken in future to absolutely obey the orders of the Government, and to take no measures tending to complicate the affairs of the country. In view of the steps which have been and are being taken, I feel confident that within a very short time the defects still existing in the south will be entirely removed, and that perfect security will be established. In the meantime, every measure will be1J taken for the protection of British lives and property and those of other foreign subjects. Under these circumstances, it is expected that your Excellency, who represents a friendly Power in whose friendship the Persian Government have complete reliance, will dissuade the British Government from taking the step contemplated, so that the Persian Government may have time to complete the measures they have undertaken, and that an uncalled-for step on the part of the British Government may not delay the achievement of their plans. I avail, &amp;c. VOSUK-ED-DOWLEH. No. 30. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 14.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, October 14, 1911. SHIRAZ and southern roads. Reference to your telegram dated 12th October. Ala-ed-Dowleh informs me that if the proposal to dispatch British troops to Shiraz is carried out he will not proceed to take up his post at that place. Although he assures me that he will go if His Majesty’s Government cancel their decision, 1 am rather doubtf ul whether, in that case, he would not discover some other excuse for refusing the appointment. The considerable force to which Persian Minister referred is composed partly of the Cossacks who, as I reported in my telegram of 13th October, are now operating against Nail) Hussein at Kashan, and I do not believe that the Russian colonel will permit them to go so far unaccompanied b}^ the two Russian officers who are with them at present. In addition to the Cossacks, I believe it has been arranged to send a force of ordinary Persian troops with Ala-ed-Dowleh, but it has been proved in the past that such soldiery melts away at Shiraz. In their representations to me, Persian Government have laid great emphasis on agreement concluded between Kawam and Soulet. Such a reconciliation is, however, scoffed at by Ala-ed-Dowleh, and, in reply to my enquiry, acting consul at Shiraz telegraphed as follows on the 13th October:— “ About ten days ago a document w T as sealed by Kawam, which had previously been sealed by Soulet, and which Avas subsequently sealed by Mirza Ibrahim, the chief stipulations of which were, that the ruling of the Persian Government in the matter of the Governor-General and the immediate dismissal of their forces should be accepted by both parties, that Soulet should protect traffic on the Bushire road, and that looted property should be returned by both sides. No importance was attached to document by Kawam, who signed it without oath and without keeping a copy—both parties intending signature merely to be a demonstration of public spirit. It is unnecessary to add that all its conditions have remained unfulfilled, and the general situation cannot conceivably be affected by it. u It did not previously occur to me that this document could be contemplated in the light of a settlement, seeing the little importance attached to it at the time.” Mr. Knox also informs me that Kawam is constantly telegraphing to the Premier, urging dismissal of Soulet from the ilkhaniship of the Kashgais, and that Soulet is, on his side, engaged in active intrigues against Kawam. In view of these reports, I am forced to regard any real settlement with some scepticism. It cannot, however, be denied that situation in the town has shown^ momentary improvement since the time wdien the decision was come to to send British troops. If, therefore, this step has been decided on solely on account of the situation in Shiraz itself, the improvement already noted and the prospect, which it seems justifiable to entertain, that if Ala-ed-Dowleh proceeds a further amelioration will occur, perhaps warrant our holding our hand. In these circumstances, if, as I infer from your telegram of 8th October, the state of the roads is to be left out of consideration, Persian Government might be informed that we will postpone the dispatch of troops for a week, but that, unless Ala-ed-Dowleh is on his way to Shiraz when that period has elapsed, they wall then leave for that town. The roads, however, are in a truly desperate state, and pending the organisation12 of an efficient gendarmerie, which is remote, there is no likelihood of any real improve ment on them. In addition to the assault on Miss Ross, of which I informed you yesterday, a large robbery of British goods has occurred near Bunder Abbas, and latest reports from His Majesty’s consul at Kerman show that no road between that town and Bunder Abbas is passable, and that conditions are Averse than consul has yet known them. 1 append two telegrams which reached me yesterday from acting consul at Shiraz and His Majesty’s consul-general, Bushire. Shiraz telegram of 13th October :— “ All telegraph lines to Bushire have been totally interrupted for last forty hours. Another gholam sent out to investigate was robbed of everything and severely beaten. Loss of tools and telephones in these robberies is causing much inconvenience to department. So far as can yet be ascertained, damage already done is most serious, line being cut in several places and large quantities of wire carried off. It is at present impossible to obtain guards for working parties, and there is consequently little hope of prompt repair.” Bushire telegram of 13th October :— “ Ala-ed-I)owleh telegraphs to Governor of Gulf Ports that Nizam and Soulet, who are in rebellion against the Government, are on their way to Kazerun to raise money; he continues that governor must at all costs oppose them, and should raise the khans on the road and in Tangistan against them, and that Nizam’s estates are forfeited to the Government and should be taken possession of. Action on above lines can only result in continued and violent disorder on road.” Cox’s telegram then recapitulates a series of outrages on telegraph employes. No. 31. Sir G.

THE Persian Minister has the honour to refer the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to his conversations with Sir Arthur Nicolson on the 4th, 7th, and I2th instant regarding the intention of His Britannic Majesty’s Government to strengthen their consular guards in Shiraz and possibly elsewhere. When on the 4th instant Sir Arthur Nicolson informed the Persian Minister of the intention of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, Mirza Mehdi Khan stated that, in his opinion, such an action at the present moment was most undesirable and unnecessary. The Persian Government had, before the recent lamentable events (viz., the return of the ex-Shah under the circumstances already well known, and the activities of Salar-ed-Dowleh) taken elaborate measures to keep the province of Ears and the trade routes secure. As His Britannic Majesty’s Government well know, the efforts of the Persian Government had not remained fruitless ; order and security was maintained, and this fact was recognised by His Britannic Majesty’s Government. The recent deplorable and serious events, however, diverted the attention of the Persian Government to the northern and western districts. Just at the time when they were busy initiating reforms and putting things in order, when they had, on the one hand, contracted a loan and on the other brought foreign experts to assist them in the reorganisation of the Departments of State, the events referred to took place ; the Persian Government had therefore to devote attention, energy, and money to save the country from so great a danger which was threatening it. Now that they had done so, they would concentrate their whole attention to the province of Ears and to the southern districts and the trade routes ; the Swedish military officers have been brought to Persia to organise a gendarmerie for this very purpose. The Persian Minister further pointed out to Sir Arthur Nicolson that, in view of the above facts, any action by Great Britain would produce a bad impression, and would be taken as a departure from the generous policy always pursued by His Britannic Majesty’s Government. Mirza Mehdi Khan said that in his opinion the situation in Shiraz, however unsatisfactory, was not such as to be of danger to Europeans, and begged that His Britannic Majesty’s Government might not take any action. After reporting this conversation to his Government, Mirza Mehdi Khan received a telegram from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, which he communicated to Sir Arthur Nicolson on the 7th instant. The Minister for Foreign Affairs approved what Mirza Mehdi Khan had said in his conversation of the 4th instant, but asked him to add that, had His Britannic Majesty’s Government given Persia their moral support, the Persian Government would have been able to devote their whole attention to the south. The Persian Government therefore begged that now, instead of increasing their consular guards, His Britannic Majesty’s Government might give them this so-much-needed moral support which it is their right and obligation to give. The Persian Government are daily harassed by most serious interferences of the Russian authorities—interferences to which the attention of His Britannic Majesty’s Government has every time been drawn. The Persian Government needs the support of Great Britain to put a stop to these interferences, which encourage malefactors and lower the prestige of the Government. On the 12th instant the Persian Minister communicated to Sir Arthur Nicolson another telegram from his Government. In view of the communications made through Mirza Mehdi Khan to the Foreign Office, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs had been surprised to receive a note from Sir George Barclay saying that it was intended to increase the consular guards in Shiraz and possibly in Ispahan ^ and Bushire. The Persian Government had taken measures to restore order immediately. ^ The Ala-ed- Dowleh had been appointed Governor-General of Fars and was on the point of leaving Tehran with a strong military force. A detachment of Cossacks, which had been sent to Kashan, had .orders to proceed to Shiraz. The Soulet-ed-Dowleh and the Kawam-ul-16 Mulk had made peace and had undertaken to act in perfect unison in assisting the Central Government to keep order. They had further solemnly promised to obey the Central Government in every matter, and had sent out of Shiraz all their armed followers. The Soulet-ed-Dowleh had further undertaken to keep the Shiraz-Bushire road secure. Moreover, the Swedish officers who have been engaged by the Persian Government for the purpose of organising a gendarmerie and protecting the trade routes arrived in Persia some time ago and are well advanced in their work. Under the circumstances the Persian Government do not see the need of any action on the part of His Britannic Majesty’s Government. The sole cause of unrest in Shiraz was the dissension between the Kashgais and the Kawamis; this has been out right by the fact that the Soulet-ed-Dowleh and the Kawam-ul-Mulk have made peace and are working in unison. European subjects are not exposed to any danger, and their safety is, as it has always been, the special care of the Persian Government. But Shiraz is already quiet, and, in view of the measures taken by the Persian Government and the fact that they are now able to devote their whole attention to the south, there is not the least cause for anxiety as to the future. The Persian Minister therefore, on behalf of his Government, begs to repeat the request that His Britannic Majesty’s Government might not take the contemplated action.

Following from His Majesty’s consul-general, Bushire :— “ Dispatch of cavalry. I have understood all along that three squadrons of cavalry only were going to Shiraz and one remaining at Bushire. If this is so I consider force should move up in one body. Knox only questions (feasibility of this course on account of supply difficulties at the Shiraz end, but these can be surmounted from Bushire. But if, however, four squadrons are to be sent up, I see no objection to their proceeding in two detachments unless any untoward development occurs between now and 27th October.” I conclude that four squadrons are intended for eventual distribution between Bushire, Shiraz, and Ispahan, and on this assumption I would propose that^ three squadrons should move up to Shiraz simultaneously, fourth squadron remaining at Bushire.

Barclay. Sir, Foreign Office, October 17, 1911. THE Persian Minister called at the Foreign Office to-day to renew the request of his Government that the dispatch of reinforcements to the consular guards should be postponed. Sir A. Nicolson went over all the old ground again with him and read to him the substance of most of the telegrams which we had received, and pointed out to him the extremely critical situation at Shiraz about a fortnight ago, and the17 deplorable condition of the roads at the present moment. Although Shiraz was for the moment fairly tranquil, this temporary improvement was largely owing, we under stood, to the knowledge that we were dispatching additional escorts, and there was no guarantee whatever that a recrudescence of the former critical state of things would not take place if we were to postpone sending our detachments. We really could not wait till some indefinite day for the Persian Government to take necessary and, above all, efficient measures themselves. The presence of our increased escorts would in reality be of assistance to the Persian authorities, and we could not admit that they would diminish the prestige of the Ala-ed-Dowleh or any other Governor-General, as the Persian Minister asserted. Sir A. Nicolson said that he was afraid that the Minister must inform his Government that, wdth every possible desire to show our good-will to them, we could not postpone measures undertaken for the protection of British lives and property. We had allowed a very long period to elapse before deciding on these steps in the hope that the situation would improve, I am, &amp;c» K GREW No. 41, Sir G.

CONVEYS substance of the following despatch, dated the 18th October ~ Sir, With reference to my telegram of the 18th instant, I have the honour to transmit herein copy of a further note from the Minister for Foreign Affairs protesting against the dispatch of reinforcements for the consular guard at Shiraz. 1 have, &amp;e. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 41. Vosuh-ed-Dowleh to Sir G. Barclay. (Translation.) Your Excellency, Tehran, October 18, 1911. WITH reference to my note of the 11th October in answer to your Excellency’s respecting the increase of the consular guard at Shiraz, I have the honour to inform you that the situation in Ears has improved on account of the appointment of his Excellency Ala-ed-Dowleh to the post of Governor-General, and at present the town is quiet and there is no disturbance in the neighbourhood. As you have already been informed, the Cossack force at Kashan has been ordered to proceed to Shiraz with the guns and ammunition now with it, and another force consisting of 3,000 men will be sent by degrees. The Swedish officers are at present making plans for the foi matron of a gendarmerie for Ears, so that after preliminary arrangements two^ of die new Swedish officers, who will arrive on the 1st December, will be sent there with a staff of Persian officers. In order to hasten the execution of this plan, instructions will be sent that before the arrival of the Swedish officers the men required for the gendarmerie shall be enlisted, so that when the officers arrive at Shiraz they wall be able to begin their effective duties without delay. Orders have been given to some companies of soldiers who have arrived at Shiraz from Behbehan to guard the foreign consulates. Although the Persian Government was not entirely free from its embarrassments in the north and west, and had, without delay, turned its attention to the south with the object of establishing full security in that region, the new r s of the proposed dispatch of 500 Indian troops from Bombay on the 24th _ October is contrary to the expectation of the Persian Government and inconsistent with the fuendship existing between the two States. The confidence of the Persian Government in its success in the task of restoring order in the south will be replaced by a feeling of disappointment, and Ala-ed-Dowleh, who is considered by the Persian Government to be the only person who can restore order in Ears, would be prevented from taking up his appointment. _ , . . I hoped that, in view of the explanations contained in my note of the 11th instant, your Excellency would dissuade your Government from sending the Indian troops [503] 018 in question. Now that the news of their intended dispatch has been received, it is obvious to what extent the Persian Government’s plans^ will he hampered. Ala-ed-Dowleh, for instance, on hearing the news,_ gave up the intention of going to Pars, saying that he could not admit of the taking of such a measure during his governorship. It is obvious that the appointment of Ala-ed-Dowleh, the dispatch of the forces mentioned, and the measures contemplated by the Persian Government, the pre liminaries of which are already in hand, are better means for the restoration of order in Pars than the dispatch of Indian troops, which may possibly bring about consequences contrary to those intended, and render the measures of the Persian Government ineffective. Therefore I earnestly hope that your Excellency will inform your Government without delay of the measures taken and in contemplation by the Persian Government, and that you will dissuade your Government from dispatching the Indian troops so that Ala-ed-Dowleh should start as early as possible and put affairs in Pars in order. In the hope of receiving a favourable reply, I avail, &amp;c. VOSUK-ED-DOWLEH. Telegram continues :— Your telegram of 14th October leads me to assume that it has been decided to dispatch as many as 400 British troops, and that, consequently, the impression I had received from your telegram of 8th October (please see my telegram of 14th October) that the condition of the roads was to be left out of consideration was incorrect, and that the troops are intended as part of our scheme for the roads. In these circumstances I venture to submit that it might be politic to inform Persian Government of the possibility of British caravans being escorted by the reinforced escorts, and further, that these reinforcements will be withdrawn as soon as effective results have been obtained from measures taken by Persian Government to restore security on the roads, and to maintain order in Shiraz.

Ilkhaniship of the tiibe is alieady being claimed by Soulet-es-Sultaneh, the brother of Sonlet-ed-Dowdeh, and it is reliably stated that the latter has written to the chief mullahs in Shiraz to the effect that he is impelled by the rumours reaching him from the town to stir ^ up general disorders in the south. A telegram has also been received from Zaigharmes-Sultaneh stating that he will delay his departure until a force of Arabs is sent to meet him on the road. Principal Aj'ab chiefs quitted Shiraz this morning, presumably with this intention.’ 5 No. 45, Mr, O’Beirne to Sir Edvxird Grey.—(Received October 19.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, October 19, 1911. CONVEYS substance of the following despatch, dated the 20th October Sir, I have the honour to state that I called yesterday on the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, wdio said that he wished to speak to me about a very pessimistic telegram vdiich he had received from M. Poklewsky. It seemed from M. Poklewsky’s report that the outlook in Persia was exceedingly dark ; things w r ere going from bad to worse ; dis orders were increasing, and he (M. Neratof) did not think that the Russian Government could much longer refrain from taking “measures of extreme rigour,” and, in fact, proceeding to an “occupation ” of Persian territory. In answer to various questions which I put to him, his Excellency said that the disorders were particularly serious in the Ardebil region, where the Shahsevans were on the move, and there had been frequent attacks on Russian convoys. Another element of disorder was that Yeprem, who had at least maintained the outward semblance of a police force, was now reported to be quarrelling with the Persian Government and leaving his post. Speaking of the pending Cabinet crisis, M. Neratof said that if the “ extremists ” obtained control at Tehran there would be no authority left in Persia with which to deal. He then went on to speak of Mr. Shuster. He complained strongly of that gentleman’s attempt to obtain a control over the whole Persian administration such as was quite incompatible with Russian interests, and referred particularly to Air. Shuster’s declared intention of obtaining a free hand from the Medjliss in regard to railway concessions and loans. I said that his Excellency already knew what were the views of His Majesty’s Government regarding an occupation of Persia. If Russia occupied North Persia, I thought it would be a matter of extreme difficulty for you to defend such a step before British public opinion. I was therefore certain that His Majesty’s Government would do everything in their power to remove the causes which, in the opinion of the Russian Government, called for Russian intervention. I reminded M. Neratof that Russia had recently vetoed the various proposals put forward with the object of enabling the Persian Government to restore order in the country— proposals which, for our part, we had welcomed as affording some hope of an improvement in the state of things in the south. Russia had objected to these proposals, but she had suggested nothing to take their place. I begged his Excellency to tell me frankly what it was that the Russian Government wished done. M. Neratof replied that the first thing necessary was that Mr. Shuster should understand that he must act in concert with, and in accordance with the interests of, Russia, and of course, his Excellency added, of Great Britain also. The Persian reforms must be proceeded with gradually and in such a manner as to take Russian interests into account. It must be remembered that the question was not merely one of the good of Persia, but also of the special position of Russia. If Mr. Shuster obtained a free hand from the Medjliss in regard to railway concessions and loans, it would be necessary that he should give an undertaking, in such a way as to inspire confidence that he would keep it, to the effect that he would act entirely according to the wishes of the two Powers. Mr. Shuster, however, was hardly the man to give an undertaking of that kind. His Excellency regretted that Russia should play an “ obstructive role ” in Persia, but it had been forced upon her against her will. I left his Excellency, saying that I would report his remarks to you. This morning, fearing that the Russian Government might possibly take some immediate [503] 0220 action, I addressed a private letter to M. Neratof, saying that I thought I had under stood from him that the Russian Government had not yet taken a definite decision with regard to the proposed measures in Persia, hut begging him, in the contrary case, to give me the earliest possible notice. His Excellency replied that the Russian Govern ment were at present only considering the necessity of a military expedition, and that they counted on the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in endeavouring to avoid active intervention on a large scale.

RUSSO-PERSIAN relations. Please refer to Mr. O’Beirne’s telegram dated 19th October. The principal feature of the situation in Tehran is the manner in which the extremists and the treasurer-general are co-operating. There is very great tension between Shuster and the 'Cabinet. A threatened ministerial crisis was avoided by a proposal to induce the Medjliss to curtail treasurer-general’s powers, but this idea appears for the time being to have been tacitly abandoned, in consequence of the opposition of the Medjliss, who feared it w r ould cause Shuster to resign office. Samsam-es-Sultaneh, wdiom I saw yesterday, expressed himself very bitterly in regard to treasurer-general. His Excellency gave me to understand that the Cabinet greatly resent the firm control Shuster is exercising over Government funds, and that they are alive to the danger which his defiant attitude towards the two Powers involves. I see no reason to suppose that Persian Government are responsible for treasurer- general’s recent utterances in the British press, which I hear will be followed by a more detailed indictment of the policy of Great Britain and Russia in Persia,Apart, however, from these publications, Shuster lias taken no specific step, such as could justify action on the lines indicated in Mr. O’Beirne’s telegram of 19th October. Russian Government must, however, find the g'eneral trend of his policy obnoxious. No. 50. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 22.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, October 22, 1911.

I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 51. Vice-Consul Strauss to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Sultanabad, September 16, 1911. I HAVE the honour to confirm my yesterday’s wire running thus :—• “Royalists took Sultanabad on the 14th September.” On the 10th September Amir Mufakham departed with his people, marching via Gulpeighan and Ivhonsar to the Bakhtiari country, and the same day Sardar Zaffar Bakhtiari left towards Kum. Both together had about 1,500 well-armed men, and it made an unfavourable impression in the town that they gave up their position here without firing a shot in defence of it. The Sultanabad people then wrote to Salar-ed-Dowleh for protection. They got the reply that, if their letter had not reached him the very same day, he would have started for Sultanabad with 30,000 men and 22 guns to destroy the place entirely. Two days later he sent about 400 men to take possession of the town. Most of them were people of the well-known robber Abbas Khan Chenari. During bis short stay in Sultanabad Sardar Zaffar collected about 50,000 tomans of taxes (“ maliat ”). The poor peasants of our province have suffered great losses ; they were robbed by Salar-ed-Dowleh’s men as well as by the Bakhtiaris. The news is spread that Salar-ed-Dowleh has appointed Hajji Seif-ed-Dowleh, the brother of Ain-ed-Dowleh, Governor of Sultanabad. People say he will be here in about two days. His park and castle were looted and destroyed by Amir Mufakham. I have, &amp;c. • T. L. STRAUSS. 503 [503] * See “ Persia, No. 3 (1912);’ No, 334, 0 3* See “ Persia, No. 3 (1912),” No. 369. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 23.) Sir, Tehran, October 2, 1911. I HAVE the honour to enclose a copy of a despatch which I have received from His Majesty’s consul at Kerman describing the deplorable condition of the Kerman- Bunder Abbas road. Since the date of this despatch there has been, as reported in my telegram of the 2nd September, a further large robbery, in which Messrs. Castelli lost heavily, and there have also been other robberies in which British Indians have suffered. With regard to other trade routes in Persia, I regret to have to report that no improvement in the state of affairs described in my despatch of the 5th September'^ can be said to have shown itself, and the political chaos prevailing at Shiraz, as reported in my recent telegrams, naturally prevents any organised attempt on the part of the local authorities to restore order on the trade routes leading to that city. Further north the dislocation caused by the advance of the rebellious Salar-ed- Dowleh, and the organisation of the military expedition sent to meet him, has rendered the safe conduct of travellers and caravans even more precarious than formerly. The Bakhtiaris, however, seem convinced of the necessity of restoring order on their road, and are contemplating measures which may fructify as soon as the khans can turn their undivided attention to them. I have, &amp;c. G, BAB,CLAY. P.S. October 3. —Since writing the above I have been informed by the Persian Government that the Government of Behbehan has been entrusted to the Bakhtiari khans. As you will remember it was the appointment of a governor inimical to Bakhtiari interests which was the signal for an outbreak of disorders on the Bakhtiari road. G. B. Enclosure in No. 52. Consul Haig to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Kerman, August 24, 1911. WITH reference to the question asked in the House of Commons on the 10th July, 1911, regarding the trade routes between Kerman and Bunder Abbas, I have the honour to inform you that I have received no report of the robbery of any carpets subsequent to the robbery of those belonging to Messrs. Nearco, Castelli et Freres in April last, hut owing to the insecurity of the road a large caravan conveying carpets has been delayed for several weeks past between Kerman and Baft, and has not yet been able to proceed on its way. 2. There are three roads between Kerman and Bunder Abbas ordinarily used by caravans : (l) by Jiruft and Budbar, (2) by Baft and Daulatabad, and (3) by Siijan, and the condition of all three during the past, three months has been deplorable. The sufferers have been Hindu traders in Kerman and Bunder Abbas, British-Indian subjects, whose caravans were robbed on the 2nd July, at Tizirk (near Sirjan), when property to the value 1,898-50 krans was stolen, on an uncertained date early in July, when property worth ] 1,007’75 krans was stolen by Bashakirdis in Budbar, end on the 20th July, when property worth 9,735-50 krans was stolen at the Gudar-i-Surkh, on the Jiruft road. ^ The value of the property stolen amounts to 22,647‘55 krans, or about 4531, and the freight paid on it to about ‘2621., the direct and immediate loss of the Hindu merchants being thus about 715Z. To this sum must he added the interest charged by their vendors, and the loss caused by their missing their market. Loss under these two heads is incurred not only on goods actually stolen, but also on those delayed owing to the insecurity of the road. 3. Not only is there no prospect of any improvement in the condition of the roads, but on the contrary every probability that matters will become worse.. There is no governor in Budhar, and the Bashakirdis, who inhabit this district, are not evennominally undei control. On the Baft road two sections of the Afshar tribe have taken che field against each other, and the whole of this road between Kerman and Daulatabad is msecuie. I have just been informed that 3,000 of the Baharlu tribe from Fars, with two guns, are marching to plunder the villages in the Sirjan district, in order to avenge a defeat suffered by them there last year, and that 350 robbers of the Baharlu and Ainarlu tribes are raiding the villages of the Bafsinjan district. On the other hand, it is commonly reported that the acting governor is wdlfully exaggerating the numbers of the robbers for the purpose of filling his own pockets by obtaining sanction from Tehran to military expenditure on an extravagant scale. I am unable at present to say whether the estimates of the strength of the robbers or the rumours of the acting governor’s dishonesty are more likely to be true, but whichever be true the prospect is sufficiently lamentable. Until lately, I should have hesitated to suspect the present acting governor of wilfully magnifying the woes of his country, but I have recently been reluctantly compelled to accept the view that this official regards his position merely as means of filling his own pockets. If the robbers are, indeed, so numerous as is reported there is very little chance of any effective action being taken against them, for the present acting governor, wFo also holds the appoint ment of commander of the provincial forces, is the Sardar-i-Nusrat, who recently retreated from Persian Baluchistan before Said Khan and Bahram Khan, and his lack of prowess in the field is not counterbalanced by any administrative ability. Most of the provincial troops are inferior in courage, mobility, and other soldierly qualities to the robbers against whom they may have to serve, their pay is in arrears, and their strength is short of the sanctioned establishment. I would add, to their credit, that I believe they are as willing to fight as their leader is. 4. Since my arrival in Kerman, on the 31st May, 1910, I have failed to recover from the local government any compensation for highway robberies, and my failure has not been due to lack of importunity. The local government has not been sufficiently strong to compel robbers to disgorge and the general revenues have not sufficed for the settlement of claims. Baluchistan has paid no revenue for the past four years, excepting an insignificant sum plundered by the Sardar-i-Nusrat during the recent expedition. The collections in other parts of the province have been imperfect and irregular and a large part of the money collected has gone into the pockets of rapacious governors, of whom Kerman has had five during the past year, and of the heads of departments established by the constitutional government, which in this province is neither understood nor appreciated except by those who hope to enrich themselves by the tenure of some office in the administration. I see no prospect of being able to obtain satisfaction of any of the claims which I have put forward and am constantly pressing on the local government, and the disproportion between the amount of these claims and the available resources of the Government has rendered the local officials hopeless and apathetic so that they no longer regard the satisfaction of claims as being within the range of practical politics. I am, &amp;c. T. W. HAIG, Lieutenant-Colonel. No. 53* Sir G. Barclay to Sir Bdward Grey.—(Received October 28.) Sir, Tehran, October 4, 1911. IN continuation of my despatch of the 4th ultimo, # I have the honour to report that the total defeat of Arshad-ed-Dowleh and the rout of Salar-ed-Dowleh’s forces have broken the back of the insurrection. Each was completely decisive as regards the danger threatening the capital from the east and west respectively. In the former fight a mixed Government force, 1,000 strong, of Armenians and Bakhtiaris, under Yeprim and the Bakhtiari Khans, Sardar Mobtashem, Sardar Bahadur, Amir Mujahid, and Zaigham- es-Sultaneh, assisted by a former German non-commissioned officer Herr Haase, who has long been in Persian service, routed the insurgents, wdio numbered about 2,000, at Imam Zadeh Jaafer, in the district of Veramin, on the 5th ultimo, capturing Arshad- ed-Dowleh, who was afterwards shot. As a result of this engagement and of a smaller victory of the Government troops under Sardar Mohiy, in the Saved Kuh district, two C 4 [503] See “ Persia, No. 3 (1912),” No. 367.24 or three days later, the Turkomans, who formed the bulk of Arshad-ed-Dowlelfs force, made the best of their way back to their own country, the movement on behalf of the ex-Shah in Mazanderan collapsed, and His Majesty left Savad Kuh, took boat at Kara Tepe on the Caspian, and arrived at Gumesh Tepe with only seven followers. When last heard of he was reported to be near Astrabad with a following of some 400 Turkomans. Salar-ed-Dowleh’s forces, after defeating Amir-i-Mufakham in the Malayir district on or about the 6th ultimo, occupied Sultanabad, the Bakhtiaris who were in that town under Sardar Zaffar and Sardar Jang retiring to Kum. Salar-ed-Dowleh himself skirting Sultanabad advanced to Noberan with a force of some 4,000 men with the intention of proceeding either via Saveli or Zarand to Tehran. His telegrams to Tehran showed that he was now playing for his own hand. In them he used a Persian expression equivalent to the use ol the first person piural by sovereigns. As soon as it became known that he was taking the Zarand route a well-equipped Government force of some 1,200 Armenians and Bakhtiaris under Yeprim, Sprdars Mohtashem and Bahadur, was dispatched to deal with him. The encounter which ensued and in which the Bakhtiaris from Kum under Sardar Zaffar and Sardar Jang took part, took place on the 27th ultimo in the neighbourhood of a village named Bagh-i-Shah, 8 miles from Saveh. The combined Government forces must have numbered some 2,000 men. The insurgent force was a horde of miscellaneous tribesmen—Kalhurs, Burs, and others— 4,000 strong, commanded by Daoud Khan chief of the Kalhurs, and other tribal chieftains. The fighting resulted in the rout of the insurgents with the loss of 500 killed, the loss on the Government side being trifling. The defeated insurgents fled westwards, and Salar-ed-Dowleh, who appears to have taken no part in the fighting and to have awaited the issue at Noberan, is now reported to be in the neighbourhood of Harnadan closely pursued by the Government troops. The only undefeated force on the ex-Shah’s side which now remains is that of Shuja-ed-Dowleh in Azerbaijan. This force has been successful in several petty combats in the near neighbourhood of Tabreez, capturing Basminch, a village some thirty minutes east of Tabreez, and even occupying the suburb of Karamalik, ten minutes west of that town. Except for the Julfa road which still remains open, Tabreez is completely invested but for a fortnight there has hardly been any fighting. The defeat of Salar-ed-Dowleh appears to have discouraged Shuja-ed-Dowleh’s followers as defections from his force are reported, and His Majesty’s consul at Tabreez states that the opinion is gaining ground that he is only holding out in the hope of making terms for himself.

One school is for Tehran and the others for the provinces. The Government is to subsidise the Tehran school at the rate of 600L a-year and the provincial schools at 480L a-year each. Half the pupils will have to pay fees and the other hall will receive tuition free. At the same sitting the Minister of the Interior presented a project for the engagement of seven more Swedish officers, i.e., one captain and six lieutenants. The captain is to organise the supply departments of the gendarmerie and police, while the lieutenants are required to form a gendarmerie training college. For this purpose a credit of 28,000 tomans was asked for and agreed upon without any debate. The re-engagement of Mr. George New, of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment, by the Persian Telegraph Administration, a step which is strongly supported by Mr. Shuster, has lately been before the Medjliss. When the question was first raised, the Medjliss refused to agree to the proposal, but Mr. New’s engagement for three years at 800Z. a-year was sanctioned on the 3rd October. On the 26th September the Electoral Law was sent by the Medjliss to the Cabinet for revision. Yeprim has been granted a life pension of 3,600 tomans a-year. The Press. —The “ Medjliss ” is the only newspaper which now appears, and it contains nothing of much interest. Tab reels. Early in September, Shuja-ed-Dowleh, working in the interests of the ex-Shah, moved to within a few miles of TabreeZ, and threatened to attack the town if not recognised as Govern or-General on behalf of Mohamed Ali. Since then Shuja-ed- Dowleh has invested the town and only the Julfa road has remained open. There has been little real fighting between the force defending the city and Shuja’s irregulars, and in view of events elsewhere it seems that Shuja is now anxious to make terms. Ghilan and Mazanderan. The province of Ghilan has remained quiet, and Mazanderan is now again under the authority of the central Government. Several Mazanderan chieftains who joined the ex-Shah have been captured and brought to Tehran. Amir Mukarrem has taken refuge with the Russian consular agent at Barfrush. There is as yet no real Persian authority at Astrabad, and it is only through the action of Russian consular officers there that order is maintained. There have been several outrages on Russian subjects in the district. Meshed. The province of Kbotassan has remained normal under an acting governor. The appointment of Ala-ed-Dowleh as Governor-General w^as announced on the 27th September, but he is now being urged to go to Fez instead. Ispahan. All the roads leading to Ispahan have been Unsafe, and robberies are reported on nearly all of them. Several posts from and to Tehran have been robbed, the caravan serais have been plundered an the Ahwaz road and goods carried off on other roads.26 The Kashan district has been the scene of fighting between the Bakhtiaris and Naib Hussein’s followers. On the 22nd September, Haib Hussein attacked Kashan and succeeded in capturing the town after two days’ fighting with the Bakhtiari defenders. Ten Bussian Cossacks travelling up to Tehran were held up by the naib who robbed them of their horses, arms, and other equipments. He apparently thought better of this later and released the prisoners, returning their effects to 'them. A detachment of the Persian Cossack Brigade under two Bussian officers is being sent from Tehran against the naib. Yezd. The state of affairs at Yezd is deplorable. There appears to be no authority what ever, and the town and district is dominated by roughs. The new Governor of Kerman was ordered by the Government to restore order at Yezd on his way to his post, but he has been unable as yet to enter the city. Some of the Government officials have taken refuge at the telegraph office. Absolute anarchy prevails in the district. Seistan. The roads all round Seistan continue to be unsafe. The Kainat is still quiet. Kerman. Amir Azam has not yet reached his post, and Sardar-i-Nosret is acting in the interim. The state of the roads, especially that to Bunder Abbas, is extremely unsatis factory, and robberies are of constant occurrence, and British trade is greatly suffering in consequence. The matter is reported upon in a separate despatch of the 2nd instant. Kermanshah. Since the departure of Salar-ed-Dowleh, the town has been fairly quiet, as all the bad characters left with the army. Kerim Khan at Kasr-i-Shirin is reported to be in a state of panic, being on bad terms with everyone on both sides of the border. Two cases of cholera were reported on the 16th September from Kasr. Hamadan. After his defeat on the 27th September, Salar-ed-Dowleh retreated towards tlamadan, hotly pursued by the Government forces. It is reported that he reached Hamadan at the beginning of October, and prepared to defend himself there. The telegraph line having been cut, the only communication with Tehran is over the Bussian telephone via Kazvin. Accurate information is at present unavailable. No. 55. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) ^ . Foreign Office, October 23, 1911. 1OU may assure Persian Government that, if they will devise an effective scheme to restore security or protect the roads, the British escorts will be used solely as consular guards to protect consulates and British lives and property in the towns wheie they are located, and will not patrol roads or make expeditions pending the execution of Persian scheme. AY hen Persian scheme is in operation and effective, increased escorts will be withdrawn. ? scorts l iave already started, and their distribution between Ispahan, Shiraz, and Bushire is left to your discretion.Sir Edward Grey to Mr. O'Beirne. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, October 23, 1911. YOUR telegram of the 19th October. I saw Count Benckendorff, and urged upon him that I could see nothing which necessitated an occupation of North Persia. Count Benckendorff replied that M. Neratof had been rendered most anxious by the prospect that the control of affairs in Persia was falling into Shuster’s hands. It was impossible for his Government to allow the predominance in Persia of a power which took no account whatever of them. He had, however, not heard that a military expedition was contemplated. To this I replied that, although I quite understood that Russia must protect her own interests if they were being undermined, I thought the danger was over estimated. Please speak to M. Neratof in sense of the above. No. 57. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 24.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, October 24, 1911. I HAVE made communication to Persian Government indicated in your telegram of yesterday, and have authorised British consul-general at Bushire to send 200 men to Shiraz and 100 to Ispahan as soon as possible. No. 58. Mr. O'Beirne to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 24.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, October 24, 1911. CONVEYS substance of the following despatch, dated the 25th October :— Sir, I called yesterday on the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and communicated to him your views, as expressed in your telegram of the 23rd instant, on the subject of the threatened Russian action in North Persia. M. Neratof said that Russia desired the independence of Persia as much as you did, but the dispatch of a military expedition would not destroy it. The dispatch^ of a Russian force to Kazvin did not have any such effect, and the presence of Russian troops at Tabreez had, on the contrary, undoubtedly saved that town from falling into the hands of the ex-Shah’s supporters. I reminded his Excellency that he had spoken to me of an “occupation,” and he said that “occupation” was perhaps too strong a word. M. Neratof s tone on this occasion was m marked contrast to that which he used at my conversation with him of the 19th instant. He appeared quite to appreciate the force of your observation that Mr. Shuster had been able to effect nothing to which the Russian Government objected, and he said that so long as that was the case Russia would take no action of the kind contemplated. 1 endeavoured, but without much success, to induce his Excellency to indicate more precisely what were the arrangements with regard to existing difficulties in Persia which he would consider satisfactory, and which would remove all cause for strong measures on the part of Russia. He reiterated that Mr. Shuster should be made to understand that he must act m consultation with the two Poweis. I have, &amp;c. HUGH O’BEIRNE.28 No. 59. &gt;Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, October 24, 1911. INCREASE of consular escorts. See your telegram of the 24th October. Two squadrons sailed from India on the 20th and 21st October. You should discuss with Colonel Cox the advisability of these two squadrons being sent to Shiraz immediately. I have agreed with the Viceroy of India’s proposal that the transports used for conveying the first two should return to Bombay for the two remaining squadrons. They will thus not arrive until November. No. 60. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 25.) (Telegraphic ) Tehran, October 25, 1911. INCREASE in consular escort. I have requested Ala-ed-Dowleh to send instructions to the local khans between Bushire and Shiraz to do everything in their power to facilitate the passage of our troops. His Excellency readily consented to do so. Apparently he has determined to proceed to Shiraz to take up his post. No. 61. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—‘(Received October 25.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, October 25, 1911. PLEASE see your telegram of the 16th instant. I can, I think, obtain 2551. forthwith as a compassionate grant in settlement of Miss Ross’s claim. The matter will be considerably, possibly indefinitely, delayed if any reservation is made as regards an additional indemnity for the beating. If I can obtain the sum of 2551. I would strongly recommend her accepting it. Do you approve provided she consents ? No. 62. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edwa7'd Grey.—(Received October 25.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, October 25, 1911. SOUTHERN roads. British merchants at Shiraz are most anxious to forward goods to Ispahan and Bushire, and have approached His Majesty’s acting consul on the subject. The roads are very insecure, and it would be better that caravans should await the arrival of the British troops if the latter might be used as escorts. The communication which I made to the Persian Government yesterday presumably, however, precludes this, at any rate until the Persian Government have been given reasonable time to elaborate an effective scheme and to put it into execution. As soon as the cavalry reaches Shiraz the sepoy guard should be leaving that place: their connection with the consulate will then have been severed, and they will be travelling to Bushire in the ordinary course of events. Do you think it would be too inconsistent with the spirit of my communication to the Persian Government if the opportunity, which is certainly a tempting one, were taken to send a commercial caravan to Bushire under British escort ?Sir Edward Grey to Mirza Mehdi Khan. SECRETARY Sir E. Grey lias the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Mirza Mehdi Khan’s memorandum of the 13th October respecting the state of affairs in Southern Persia and the decision of His Majesty’s Government to strengthen their consular escorts there. Sir E. Grey has the honour to state, in reply, that, as Mirza Mehdi Khan has already been informed verbally, the reinforcement is now under orders, and that it is too late to counterorder it. The escorts wdll be allocated to certain specified towns in Persia for the protection of the consulates and British life and property. His Majesty’s Government will welcome any measure which the Persian Government may take for restoring security and for reopening the roads to peaceable trade intercourse, and when these ends have been atttained the reinforcements will be withdrawal from Persia. Sir E. Grey would remind Mirza Mehdi Khan that His Majesty’s Government have already on many occasions received assurances of the Persian Government’s ability to restore order, and that these assurances have so far not resulted in any satisfactory action. His Majesty’s Government do not, therefore, feel justified in accepting them at the present juncture, when, owing to the powerlessness of the Central Government, a state of practical anarchy exists in the province of Ears and elsewhere. This anarchy culminated in a situation at Shiraz which threatened the gravest danger to British life and property, and which is apparently liable to recur at any moment. The nomination of Ala-ed-Dowleh as Governor-General of Ears, and the reconciliation between Soulet- ed-Dowleh and Kawam-ul-Mulk, to which Mirza Mehdi Khan alludes in his memo randum, scarcely seem likely to have the pacifying effect which Mirza Mehdi Khan anticipates. Indeed, His Majesty’s Government have received recent information to the effect that an English lady doctor has been robbed and badly beaten near Abadeh, on which occasion Messrs. Dixon lost goods to the value of 1,4001.; that a telegraph gholam has been robbed of his instruments and his horse within 4 miles of Shiraz ; that a second gholam, accompanied by a Government sowar, is surrounded by tribes men at 8 miles distance from that town. The post from Bushire has been robbed, the road south from Shiraz is so dangerous as to be practically impassable, while that leading to the north has been completely closed for the past month. Soulet-ed-Dowleh, so far from assisting the Central Government to keep order, as Mirza Mehdi Khan states that he has promised to do, has, according to His Majesty’s Government’s information, openly threatened to renew trouble. His Majesty’s Government are further informed that 300 soldiers of the Hamadan regiment were recently worsted by a large band of Kuhgeluis, near Yezdikhast, after a severe conflict; that on the 13th October four bales of piece-goods, the property of Messrs. Ziegler, v r ere seized by robbers on the Shiraz-Bushire road ; and that earlier in the month Messrs. Weir were robbed of goods to the value of 400?, near Kamarij. In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government cannot consider the state of Southern Persia in general, and of Shiraz in particular, as being other than menacing to British life and property, and it has become incumbent upon them to provide British subjects with that adequate protection which is at present beyond the power of the Persian Government. As soon as security is established in the disturbed legion, His Majesty’s Government will withdraw the additional escorts which they have now been reluctantly compelled to dispatch from India. Foreign Office, October 25, 1911. No. 64. Sir Edward Grey to Mr. O'Beirne. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, October 26, 1911. YOUR telegram of 7th October. You should inform Russian Government that we have for the present abandoned the proposals respecting Bunder Abbas, Kerman, and Bam, and that we are only sending 400 men for distribution between Bushire, Shiraz, and Ispahan at the discretion of Sir G. Barclay in consultation with local consular authorities. The first portion of this force will arrive at Bushire on 26th October; the second half will arrive in30 November. You should also say we have informed the Persian Government that decision to send increased escorts has only been taken owing to danger to British life and property at Shiraz and elsewhere, that we shall welcome any measures which Persian Government may take to restore security and reopen roads to peaceable trade, and that when these ends have been attained reinforcements will be withdrawn from Persia. No. 65. Sir Edivard Grey to Mr. O’Beirne. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, October 26, 1911. YOUR telegram of the 24th October. Persia’s independence cannot, I agree, be allowed to be marked by unfriendliness either to Great Britain or to Russia, and it is obvious that, in view of the geographical situation, no Government which refused to respect interests of Russia could be tolerated by the latter at Tehran. This we shall certainly impress on Shuster when the occasion arises, and I need hardly point out that our refusal to let Major Stokes resign was already practically a declaration in this sense. Unless Persian Government are provided with funds the southern roads will continue to be impassable, and our trade will suffer. It is therefore important to give Persia financial assistance at an early date. As soon as you have a favourable opportunity, you should speak in the above sense to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. No. 66. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.)

I INFORMED you in my memorandum of the 23rd September (6th October) last that it tv as possible that the Imperial Oovernment would be obliged to reinforce some of our consular escorts in Persia in view of the unsatisfactory state of things in that country. My anticipations have been realised ; we have now decided to reinforce the escorts of our consulates at Ispahan and Resht, the first by 150 men, the second by 100. The detachments in question will be dispatched shortly. Yours sincerely, A. NERATOF. No. 68. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 28.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, October 28, 1911. I HAVE the honour to report that Messrs. E. C. Haycock and Schindler, British subjects, have been appointed by treasurer-general at Ispahan and Shiraz respectively as his agents. It is possible that appointment of Mr. Haycock may lead to objections on the part of the Russian Government, as His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan reports that his Russian colleague has openly expressed his surprise at the appointment of a British subject in the Russian zone of interest. I understand that Mr. Haycock, who is married to an Armenian, has been since 1897 in Ispahan, where he has been engaged in business. I have no reason to believe that he is in any degree Russophobe. M. Poklewski quite understands that the appointment was made entirely without my knowledge, and that I could not have stopped a private individual from accepting a post offered to him by treasurer-general. No. 69. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received October 28.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, October 28, 1911. ESCORT reinforcements. I venture to suggest that Lieutenant Wilson may be authorised to remain at Shiraz in order to accompany to Ispahan the squadron destined for His Majesty’s consulate-general at that town. Troops would greatly benefit during their march up by his knowledge of Persia. It would not be necessary to retain him for very long, as one of the squadrons now being disembarked at Bushire will proceed to Ispahan. * No. 70.

I am under the impression that he is expecting another 200 for the increase of his consular escort at Ispahan.

Two members of the Eussian consulate in uniform, with ten Eussian Cossacks, ordered them to retire, threatening to fire. The party retired. The incident so far is unexplained, as Shoa-es-Sultaneh claims Turkish, not Eussian, protection. The matter has now been referred to the Eussian Minister.” ( 2 .) “ Tehran, October 10. “ Two further incidents took place yesterday in connection with the confiscation of the various properties of Shoa-es-Sultaneh. Eussian Cossacks with consular officials were present at each property. They arrested five Treasury gendarmes who were sent with a Treasury official to make the inventory, and took them on mules to the Eussian consulate. “ To-day a strong body of Treasury gendarmerie marched to Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s principal property, where they found a small guard of Persian Cossacks only. They evicted the guard and took possession. The Eussian Cossacks are now said to have withdrawn from all the properties. “ All these proceedings appear to have been due to the initiative of M. Pokhitonoff, the Eussian consul-general. The Eussian Minister has rectified the matter, and the incident now seems to be closed, except that the Persian Government is addressing a protest against the action of the consul-general.” As you will see from these telegrams, the action of the Eussian consul-general wa directed against the seizure of certain properties of Shoa-es-Sultaneh, who is not a Eussian subject. Eussian Minister is to-day demanding, in accordance with orders from St. Petersburgh, the withdrawal from the Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s properties of Shusters gendarmes, who are now in possession. These properties being mortgaged to the Eussian bank, and one of them being leased to a Eussian subject, the Eussian Minister had made all proper reserves with the Persian Government as to Eussian rights, but the Eussian Government bases its demand on the fact that Shuster’s gendarmes were sent to take possession without previous notice having been given to the Eussian consulate-general. M. Poklewsky is further to demand a formal apology for an incident alleged to have occurred on the 10th October at the principal property in question, when the gendarmes in possession are said to have pointed their rifles at two passing officials of the consulate- general and at the consulate-general itself, which is close to the property. This story is disputed by the officer commanding the gendarmes, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs had offered the Eussian Minister reparation for this incident in the event of confirmation of the story of the Eussian consular officials after a joint enquiry. The Eussian Government reject this proposal, and demand an apology forthwith. No. 77. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .—{Received November 2'.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 2, 1911. ME.

Barclay. gi r Foreign Office, November 3, 1911. THE Persian Minister called this afternoon and complained that the Russian consul at Astrabad was encouraging and assisting the ex-Shah, and that several Russian Turkomans were in the following of the latter. He also complained that the ex-Shah had ordered arms and ammunition in France and Germany, and that these consignments would have to pass through Russian territory. In regard to the first complaint the Russians had denied that their authorities were in any way encouraging the ex-Shah, and in regard to the second, they had promised to give orders to their customs officials to prevent the transit of the munitions, though they could not guarantee that the articles might not be smuggled through. Sir A. Nicolson asked the Minister what he wished us to do. We could not intervene in the matter, and we could not go to the Russians and say that we disbelieved all they said and gave credence to all the reports which reached the Persian Government. The Minister said there were Russian Turkomans with the ex-Shah. Sir A. Nicolson regretted not to be able to give him anything to console him; but we had no ground for intervening. I am, &amp;c. E.

Please ascertain and report if there is any confirmation of this. No. 80. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 5.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 5, 1911. ALLEGED Russian support for ex-Shah. A story has been current here that Russian troops landed and took part in the fighting reported in my telegram of the 29th October. The statement made to you by the Persian Minister (see your telegram of yesterday’s date) is probably a version of this story. No confirmation of the story has reached me. My only reliable source of information for events in the Astrabad district is the Russian Minister, who states that the story has no foundation. A few bluejackets were landed at Bender Gez after the fighting was over, because the Turkomans showed signs of looting. The Naval station at Asurade gave medical assistance to the wounded. Some of the wounded Government troops were taken to the hospital for treatment, and are now there. A few of the Government troops are still in the shelter of the Russian agency at Bender Gez, where a large number took bast after the fighting. No. 81. Sir G.

A message reached me this morning from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which his Excellency urged me to use my influence with, the Russian Minister for moderation. I replied that the Persian Government would do well to comply with the demands, and I pointed out that the Russian Minister could not modify demands which his Government had formulated after careful deliberation. No. 82. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 6, 1911. APPOINTMENT of Mr. Lecoffre : see your telegram of 2nd November. Russian Government are sure to be annoyed at this appointment, and it is not unlikely that they will defend their interests by energetic measures, which might even go as far as an occupation of Northern Persia. You should advise Shuster most strongly to do all in his power to conciliate the Russian Legation, and point out the probable result of continued provocation on his part. He should be made to under stand clearly that Russian Government have it in their power to employ means which would seriously impede the discharge of his duties, and which it would be impossible for him to withstand. He must be made to see that the Russians are sure to take measures for the protection of their own interests if administrative posts in their sphere of interest are filied by British subjects, and that His Majesty’s Government cannot deprecate such measures, as it would be contrary to the spirit of the convention of 1907. His Majesty’s Government are pledged to avoid any displacement of Russian influence by British in the north, and the Russians are gaining the impression that under cover of Shuster’s administration this is being done.

The Persian reply to the Russian demands is dignified and temperate in tone, but it formally rejects the demands, stating that they are inconsistent with the dignity of Persia and with the friendly relations existing between Russia and Persia. The Persian Government maintain their innocence and declare that the Russian Government cannot have fully grasped the facts of the case when forming their judgment. They invite a full elucidation of all the circumstances and declare themselves ready to hold an enquiry. As the Russian Government formulated their demands after long deliberation they can hardly be expected to draw back.36 No. 85. Mr. O'Beirne to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November G.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, November 6, 1911. CONVEYS substance of the following despatch, dated the 7th November :— Sir, The Russian Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs said to me yesterday that he was constantly receiving reports from Persia of a most unsatisfactory character, that the situation was becoming impossible, and that if matters did not improve it would really be necessary for Russia to do something. His Excellency referred particularly to two subjects of conflict which had arisen between the Russian and Persian Governments—certain recent appointments made by Mr. Shuster, and an incident between Persian Cossacks and Mr. Shuster’s gendarmes in which the Russian consul-general was concerned. The second of these matters has been referred to in recent press telegrams from Tehran. According to the very brief account of it which M. Neratof gave me, the Persian authorities (for wTiose action his Excellency thought that Mr. Shuster was responsible) desired to take possession of certain property belonging to adherents of the ex-Shah in wdiich the Russian bank had an interest. The Russian Government did not object to the sequestration of the property, but they were bound to safeguard the interests of their bank. The Russian consul-general had placed Cossacks as guards over the property, and there had been a conflict of some sort between the Cossacks and Mr. Shuster’s gendarmes. Thereupon, the Persian Government had gone so far as to demand the recall of the consul-general, and also, I think, of some subordinate officials of the consulate who had been involved in the dispute. The Russian Minister had of course returned the Persian note, and there had been a lively explanation between M. Poklewski and the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Everything now depended on the further action of the Persian Government. If they persisted in the attitude which they had taken up the matter would become excessively serious, and he did not know what action the Russian Government would have to take. The relations between the two Governments were, as I could see, extremely strained. As regards the question of appointments, M. Neratof stated that Mr. Shuster had nominated three Treasury agents at Shiraz, Ispahan, and Tabreez respectively, who were, his Excellency said positively (though this I questioned), all Englishmen. The Russian Government did not object to the first two appointments (they had received favourable accounts of the nominee at Ispahan), but the person appointed to Tabreez, a Mr. Lecoffre, was known to them as being violently antagonistic to Russia. This appointment could not be maintained. I said that his Excellency could be certain that the appointments in question had been made without the knowledge of Sir G. Barclay, and this assurance M. Neratof readily accepted. As to the tension which had come about in Russo-Persian relations, I said that it would be a pity if the proceedings of an American citizen should lead Russia to take measures in North Persia to which she w T ould otherwise not have resorted. The thing was to prevent Mr. Shuster from doing what w T as obnoxious to Russia, and it seemed to me personally that the two representatives at Tehran, if instructed in that sense, would find means to make it clear that Mr. Shuster must cease from his present course of action, or must go. M. Neratof discussed the subject for some time, but did not seem to think that any action on the part of the representatives at the present moment would help matters. It was true, he said, that the Persian Government were themselves not very pleased with Mr. Shuster, but he had strong support in the Medjliss. Moreover, there was his contract with the Persian Government, which his Excellency thought would make it difficult to dispense with his services until his term of employment had expired. I have, &amp;c. HUGH O’BEIRNE. No. 86. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edicard Grey.—(Received November 7.) (felegraphic.) Tehran, November 7, 1911. MISS ROSS. The Governor*General has instructed the deputy governor at Shiraz to send100 men to escort Miss Ross to Shiraz from Abadeh, where she is now detained. I doubt, however, whether the deputy governor will be able to provide the guard. His Majesty s acting consul at Shiraz is of opinion that Miss Ross’s health will probably suffer from her enforced stay at Abadeh. He also reports that she is most anxious to proceed to Shiraz, and he asks to be allowed to dispatch a suitable detach ment of the Indian troops, when available, to escort her to Shiraz, provided of course that the commanding officer concurs. Mr. Knox does not think that the local authorities would raise the slightest objection to this course. An objection to this, however, is that if we use the consular guard in the case of Miss Ross we shall probably be obliged to do so in other cases. But if a suitable Persian escort is not forthcoming, it would appear to be the only safe way of bringing the lady to Shiraz. Mr. Knox states that the lawless element is watching the case of Miss Ross with great interest, and doubtless our treatment of the question will have great local significance. Please see your telegram of the 26th ultimo. Miss Ross acquiesced in the proposed manner of settlement, and I have accepted as full settlement of the first robbery the promised and immediate payment by the Persian Government of the value of the property then lost. I shall present them with a claim for the second robbery, and am now considering the amount to be claimed. No. 87. Mr. O'Bcirne to Sir Edward Grey.—{Beceived November 7.) (Telegraphic.)

The Russian Minister addressed at the time a suitable reply to the Persian Government’s note demanding the recall of the Russian consul-general. The only comment which the Persian Government has made on the return of this note has been an expression of regret that it should have been returned. The matter might therefore be considered closed if the acquiescence of the Persian Government in the return of the note were all that w r as required. The great difficulty is, however, the demand for an apology and for the withdrawal of the gendarmes from the property in question. No. 89. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Beceived November 8.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 8, 1911. APPOINTMENT of Englishman as Treasury agent at Tabreez. I spoke to Shuster this afternoon, as instructed in your telegram of the 6th instant. The latter declared that he was most anxious to conciliate the Russian Legation, and that he had always been desirous of doing so, but he was not prepared to allow all progress in Persian reforms to be nullified. He thought that His Majesty’s Government would see convincing proof that this w r as the aim of the Russian [503 | D 338 Government in the specific instances of obstruction cited in the open letter which he has written for publication. He said that Azerbaijan finance was in a deplorable condition, for instead of revenue coming in to the Central Government, the latter had to remit money to the province. Lecoffre was an expert in Azerbaijan finance. His appointment to Tahreez had been decided upon four months ago, and he was quite determined that he should proceed to the post. He had had no idea when making the appointment that Lecoffre was a Russophobe, and he was compelled to select his instruments from the scanty material at his disposal. I laid strong emphasis on the danger which the Persian Government would incur by defying Russia, and I enquired what he thought the attitude of the Persians would be in the face of the Russian protest. He replied that he presumed they would “ wait like a condemned man until he was hanged by someone stronger than him,” which was what they were already doing in the case of the demands referred to in my telegram of the 6th instant.

No. 94. Mr. O’Beirne to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 10.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, November 10, 1911. CONVEYS substance of the following despatch, dated the 11th November :— Sir, 1 called yesterday on the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs in order to ascertain how matters stood with regard to the latest Russo-Persian incident. At our conversation of the 6th instant, which is reported in my telegram of that date, M. Neratof had said nothing about a demand on the part of the Russian Minister for an apology for insults offered to Russian consular officials, and I was yesterday not yet aware of the contents of Sir G. Barclay’s recent telegrams on the subject. I had, however, seen some press telegrams, which seemed to show that the difference between the two Governments had reached a critical point. M. Neratof now informed me that M. Poklewski had made the following three demands verbally of the Persian Government : That they should acquiesce in the return of their note asking for the recall of the consul-general; that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should express his regrets for insulting conduct of wdiich the Persian gendarmes had been guilty towards certain Russian consular officials; and, lastly, that the gendarmes should be withdrawn from the house of Shoa-es- Sultaneh, which had been the scene of the dispute, and should be replaced by Persian Cossacks. The Persian Government had apparently acquiesced in the return of their note, though they stated that they regretted M. Poklewski’s action in returning it. They had declined the other two demands, asking that in the first place a joint enquiry should be held into the facts. On this point M. Neratof explained to me that the insults which the Russian Government complained of consisted in the gendarmes having pointed their rifles at two officials of the Russian consulate, who, as 1 understood, were passing Shoa-es- Sultaneh’s house. The facts were vouched for, his Excellency said, by the two officials, and also by a Russian officer who was present. The only other witnesses who could be questioned were the gendarmes themselves, and the statements of the consular officials must be accepted. Proceeding, M. Neratof said that M. Poklewski had reported to the Imperial Government the attitude taken by the Persian Government in regard to his demands, and that he had thereupon been instructed to present the same demands to the Persian Government in writing, and to ask for an immediate reply. He was probably carrying out these instructions on the day of our conversation (yesterday). He was further instructed that if he did not receive a satisfactory reply within two days he was to inform the Persian Government that relations were broken off, and that ihe Russian Government would take the measures which they thought necessary. M. Neratof added that he would tell me in confidence that the measure which the Russian Government had determined upon was the dispatch of a Russian force to Kazvin as on a previous occasion. It should be of sufficient strength to permit of a detachment being- summoned by M. Poklewski to Tehran which would remove the gendarmes from Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s house and instal Persian Cossacks in their place, after which it would return to Kazvin. I made no comment on what his Excellency told me beyond saying that I supposed the Persian Government would give way. I have, &amp;c. HUGH O’BEIRNE.;||i I,®;'' 40 No. 95. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.

It is probable that, if Shuster were to co-operate with the Russian Legation instead of working against it, he would not find it obstructive. As regards Mr. Lecoffre, if the Russian Government request the Persian Government not to ratify his appointment, you may advise the Persian Government to comply with their demand. To do so would be in their own interests, as, if they refused, Russia might be induced to take action with a view to protecting her interests in Persia. No. 96. Sir G.

STOKES begs that you will be so kind as to forward the following telegram to the Secretary of State for India :— “ Refusal of my resignation by the Government of India has been communicated to me. It places me in the position of having to choose between disregarding the orders of His Majesty’s Government and breaking my faith pledged on conditions officially formulated by His Majesty’s Government themselves (see Foreign Office telegram of the 21st July). I most respectfully and most earnestly request His Majesty’s Government to reconsider their decision and to permit me to resign. I have throughout acted in entire good faith, and the difficulty of my position is not in any sense of my own making.” A telegram reached me from the Government of India on the 5th November to the effect that they were unable to accept Stokes’s resignation, as His Majesty’s Govern ment could not advise His Majesty to accept the resignation of an officer who handed it in solely in order to take service under a foreign Powrnr in circumstances which, in their judgment, made his action detrimental to British interests. 1 informed Stokes on the same day of this decision, and added, as requested by the Government of India, that he was to proceed to Simla as soon as possible to join the general staff branch there. I have urged him repeatedly since then to leave Tehran, but I doubt whether my words will have any effect. In view of the possibility of the forcible removal of Shuster’s gendarmes, if the Persian Government do not yield to the Russian demands the matter may prove very serious, for if Stokes persists in his hesitation to obey our orders, he would probably become involved in any conflict between Russian Cossacks and Treasury gendarmes.

I have, &amp;c. HUGH O’BEIRNE. Enclosure in No. 101. Official Communique to Russian Press. (Translation.) October 31 (November 13), 1911. WITH regard to the conflict with the Persian Government, the official information bureau makes the following communication :— This conflict arose from the measures taken by the Persian Government for the confiscation of the property of certain partisans of the former Shah Mohamed Ali and especially of his brother, Prince Shoa-es-Sultaneh. The Persian Government informed the Russian Legation of their intention to confiscate the property of certain persons who had taken part in the struggle of the ex-Shah against the Government, whereupon the legation on its side, without protesting in any way against this principle, held it necessary to remark that the interests of Russian subjects, which might be connected in one way or another with the property owner’s name, must be safeguarded in a proper manner. Some days afterwards, on the order of the Financial Adviser, Morgan Shuster, a party of the gendarmerie just organised by him occupied the house of Shoa-es- Sultaneh, which was guarded by some Cossacks of the Persian Cossack brigade, who were posted there at the wish of the Turkish Ambassador in Tehran. This last circumstance is explained by Shoa-es-Sultaneh being a Turkish subject. Several officials entered with the gendarmes to make an inventory in the house of the Prince’s possessions. The Government had not held it necessary to inform in due time our consul-general in Tehran, whose direct duty it is to protect the interests of Russian subjects. The consul-general learned by chance of the conduct of the Persian gendarmerie. He knew that the Prince had obligations to the Russian Discount Rank, which are secured on the real estate of Shoa-es-Sultaneh, and saw himself compelled to send his officials to the house and to the country estate of the Prince to protect the interests of Russian subjects and of the bank, and to charge them to insist on the removal of the gendarmes until the receipt of the required guarantees from the Persian Government. At the instance of the consular officials, who were accompanied to the spot by a small convoy of Russian Cossacks, Shuster’s gendarmeswere removed from the house and the country estate, whereupon the former was occupied again by Cossacks of the Persian brigade. Shuster, who saw that he had been guilty of an incorrectness in this matter in his relations to the Russian Minister, sent his assistant to the consul-general, and only then presented to him the confiscation order, on which occasion this official, according to the opinion of the consul-general, behaved very arrogantly. Yet before the end of his conversation with Shusters representative, State Councillor Pokhitonoff learnt that over a hundred Persian gendarmes had again occupied the house and the garden of the Prince, having got there over a fence and forcibly disarmed and sent off the Cossacks of the Persian brigade. When afterwards the officials of the consulate-general, Petroff and Hildebrant, returned to their quarters, which are opposite the house of Shoa-es-Sultaneh, they saw in a room over the entrance gate a number of Persian gendarmes, who dared to point their rifles with the evident intention of firing at both officials, but thanks to the accidental presence and inter vention of a native officer of the Per sian Cossack brigade this was prevented. (The officials heard clearly the order : “ ready ! ” and the clacking of the charging of the rifle magazines.) The assumption that the gendarmes did not know on whom they aimed is unpermissible as both officials wore uniform and are well known at the place. Hereupon the Persian Government, departing from all traditions, made a claim on the Imperial Legation to recall Consul-General Pokhitonoff and the two above-named officials of the consulate-general from Tehran, and indeed this claim was made in writing in two notes following one another. On examining the incident the Russian Government confirmed the correct behaviour, suitable to the circumstances, of the consul-general in Tehran and his officials. On the other hand, it marked the openly provocative behaviour, contrary to the traditional friendly relations of both Powers, not only of the Persian gendarmerie under Shuster’s orders, but of the Persian Government itself. It suffices in this connection to point to the sending of a hundred gendarmes to Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s house before the conclusion of the negotiations with the consul-general (as if foreseeing a collision with the convoy of our consul), the forcible removal of the Cossacks of the Persian brigade from the said house, which had been entrusted by officials of our consulate to them to guard, but especially the fact that the gendarmes aimed their rifles at our officials, and the sending of the two above-named notes by the Persian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Russian Government regarded this behaviour of the Persian authorities and their Government as wholly unpermissible from the standpoint of Russia’s dignity, and instructed the Imperial Minister to take up the matter verbally in a friendly way with the Persian Foreign Minister, to give him back both notes and to require :— 1. The replacing of the gendarmes in the house and on the estate of Shoa-es- Sultaneh by Cossacks of the brigade until the interests of our bank and of Russian subjects connected with the property of the Prince are fully secured ; and 2. An apology for the insulting conduct of the Persians towards the officials of the consulate-general. The Persian Government, however, rejected the explanations of the Minister and put forward a plan for a mutual enquiry into the behaviour of the officials of the consulate-general, which was naturally absolutely unacceptable, as the Imperial Government alone can judge of the correctness or incorrectness of the orders or proceedings of their officials. In view of this the Russian Minister received instructions to present again to the Persian Government the same demand for satisfaction, this time in writing and with the warning, that, in case the Persians do not yield forthwith, the Ambassador will break off relations with the Tehran Cabinet and the Russian Government will prepare to resort to the measures which seem needful for the protection of their interests. According to a telegram received from State Councillor Poklewski-Koziell a note in this sense was handed on the 29th October (11th November) to the Persian Foreign Minister together with a warning in the sense indicated.Mr. O’Beirnc to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 13.) (Telegraphic.) St. Pctersburgh, November 13, 1911. CONVEYS substance of the following despatch, dated the 14th November :— Sir, At a conversation which I had with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday his Excellency, after dwelling on the most recent misdeeds of Mr. Shuster, said that he could see no issue from the difficulties of the situation in Persia. The latest proceedings on Mr. Shuster’s part, to which his Excellency referred, were his refusal, notwithstanding Sir G. Barclay’s remonstrances, to rescind the nomination of Mr. Lecoffre as Treasury agent at Tabreez and the course which he had taken in regard to Russian lease-holders in Persia. So far as I gathered from M. Neratof, the treasurer-general had quite recently addressed a circular direct to Russian holders of property under lease, whether from the Persian Government or from private individuals, calling upon them to notify their claims to him, failing which they would not be recognised by the Persian Government. In thus ignoring the Russian consulate-general Mr. Shuster had, M. Neratof said, acted contrary to all established usage in Persia. I have, &amp;c. HUGH O’BEIRNE. No. 103.

CONVEYS substance of the following extract from a despatch dated the loth November:— I have the honour to report in continuation of my telegram of the 10th instant that I called on the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday evening, the 14th, to enquire whether any answer had been received to the note handed by M. Poklewski to the Persian Government on the 11th instant. M. Neratof said that he had heard nothing as yet from M. Poklewski, and that if he did not receive a satisfactory communication next morning the Russian Government would act. I had seen a telegram in that day’s papers reporting that the Regent and the Persian Ministers had resigned in consequence of the Russian note. I referred to this report* and I said to M. Neratof that, while I fully realised that the present question Avas the concern of Russia, it Avas one Avhich indirectly interested His Majesty’s Government (to Avhich his Excellency cordially assented), and therefore I felt justified in suggesting to him that, if owing to the resignation of the Persian Government, it Avas materially impossible for Persia to comply immediately with the Russian demands, it might be more generous for the Russian Government, instead of taking measures forthAvith, to name a definite time—a week for instance—within Avhich the demands must be fulfilled. M. Neratof replied, that he Avas perfectly convinced that nothing would be gained by this delay ; it was evident that the resignation of the Persian Ministers was merely a device to avoid compliance with Russia’s demands, and Avhatever Ministers held office at the expiry of the week’s grace would resign for the same purpose. He went on to say that, if Russia should take the measures contemplated, she maintained (as things now stood) the undertakings which she had given to His Majesty’s Government with regard to Persia, and she would give you through the Russian Ambassador assurances similar to those which she gave on the former occasion when Russian troops Avent to Kazvin. I have, &amp;c. HUGH O’BEIRNE.Sir Edward Grey to Mr. O'Beirne. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 14, 1911. RUSSIAN complaints against Shnster s action, as reported in yonr telegram of yesterday, seem to be better founded than dispute about Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s property, as regards which I am inclined, judging by the version of facts in my possession, to consider that there has been some misunderstanding. You might tell Minister for Foreign Affairs that I fully realise that the Russian Government cannot abandon the standpoint they have taken up in this matter, but the real and more substantial difficulty seems to be Shuster’s anti-Russian policy in Northern Persia, and the Russian Government should, I think, make public their own case against that. Could they not formulate their complaints against Shuster and make a formal demand respecting them ? You should inform Minister for Foreign Affairs that it is my sincere hope that the Russian Government will not go further than the assurances given me by Count Benckendorff regarding their intentions, that is, to restrict dispatch of detachment to Kazvin and not to send any men to Tehran unless required by Russian Minister for protection of legation. It would be deplorable if a crisis were precipitated which led to a Russian occupation and the fall of Persian Government. No. 110. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 15.)

Instructions were received at the Russian Legation last night to break off relations with the Cabinet if one existed ; a detachment of Russian troops would then be dispatched to Kazvin. M. Poklewski has telegraphed to his Government this morning to the effect that no Cabinet has yet been formed, but that if when formed the new one does not immediately satisfy Russian demands he will break off relations. He has also telegraphed his opinion that if compliance with the Russian demands does not result from the dispatch of troops to Kazvin it will be necessary to send 2,000 men to Tehran in order to make certain of attaining the object in view, and that in order to keep open communications 2,000 more will be needed as a reserve at Kazvin. The Treasury gendarmerie could muster 350 men if necessary, but I fear that the force sent in the event of the Persian Government’s refusal of satisfaction must be so large as to make resistance hopeless if all possibility of bloodshed is to be avoided.

Poklewski had reported that the Persian Prime Minister46 and the Minister of Foreign Affairs had resigned, and that there was_ no present likelihood of a compliance with the Russian demands. Under these circumstances M. Neratof said it was his personal opinion that Russia must take action forthwith. I then made a strong appeal to his Excellency in favour of allowing Persia a short further period of grace. I suggested that the^ Russian Government might declare that, in view of the resignation of the Persian Ministry, they would not take the immediate action on which they had determined, but they would allow, say, three days, in which Persia could give the required satisfaction. I urged, that if the Russian Government acted in this way they would be in a better position to defend subsequent strong measures, should these be forced upon them. Otherwise, they would be accused of taking advantage of the temporary absence of a Persian Government to intervene by force in that country. M. Neratof on this occasion did not altogether decline to entertain my plea for a further delay. Without giving me a definite answer he held out some hopes that he might take the course suggested, but he said very positively that five days having already elapsed since the presentation of the Russian note, it would be necessary if Russia accorded a further delay that she should also increase her demands. It occurred to him that he might put forward a demand for the dismissal of the officials responsible for the action of the gendarmerie, including Mr. Shuster, under whose orders that body stood. This was an idea which, he said, he must consider further. I have, &amp;c. HUGH O’BEIRNE. No. 113. Mr. O'Beirne to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 15.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, November 15, 1911. I SPOKE to M. Neratof as instructed in your telegram of the 14th November. His Excellency explained to me that the Russian Government considered it absolutely essential that the house in dispute should be evacuated by the gendarmerie force. In taking possession of the property the gendarmes had disarmed the men of the Cossack brigade, and they had subsequently insulted Russian consular officials. It was, therefore, absolutely necessary for the Russian Government to effect their with drawal. With this object in view, a detachment would, if necessary, be sent up to Tehran from Kazvin. With regard to your suggestion that the Russian Government might formulate their complaints against Shuster, M. Neratof pointed out that, from a formal point of view, it would be difficult for them to protest against appointments such as that of M. Lecoffre to Tabreez, since such a protest would constitute an interference in the internal affairs of Persia. His Excellency, however, is now considering whether he might not base a demand for the dismissal of Shuster on the ground that the treasurer- general must be held responsible for the action of his own gendarmes (see my preceding telegram of to-day). It is evident that the Russian Government consider that Russian prestige is gravely involved in the dispute over Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s sequestered property, inasmuch as it developed into a conflict between Shuster and his gendarmes on the one side and the Russian consul-general and the Cossack brigade on the other.

I THINK I ought to inform you that, as the Turkomans have been pillaging in the neighbourhood of Astrabad since Mohamed Ali Shah’s victory over a body of the Persian Government’s troops, and in view of the fact that the lives and property of Russian subjects on the spot and also the town itself are seriously threatened by these hordes of nomads, we are reinforcing the escort of our consul at Astrabad by 1 200 Cossacks and two quick-firing guns. I have just received a telegram from Poklewsky informing me that the official note respecting the settlement of the incident of the dispute was handed to the Persian Government yesterday, the 29th October (11th November).

N eratof:— Although His Majesty’s Government quite agree that the decision and formulation of her own demands must rest with Russia, they feel considerable anxiety as to the ulterior consequences which her action may have. In my opinion, it would have been possible for Russia to wait until the detachment had reached Kazvin and then formulate her demands, and, before taking any further action, to allow more time to elapse. We ourselves, if we had had to secure redress of a grievance, would probably in the first instance seize a custom-house. I see no reason why Russia should not, if necessary, do this, and await the effect of her action before bringing further pressure to bear. No. 121. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.

The Councillor informed me that the Russian Ambassador in Vienna stated positively that he had never seen the ex-Shah or made to him any declaration whatever. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY.Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. Sir ’ r rrryr-n n -n P , ^ . Foreign Office, November 16, 1011. O D the Councillor of the Russian Embassy to-day that I was seriously concerned about 1 ersia. ' Russian Government were satisfied that they had grievances which demanded rediess, the\ must, of course, formulate their own demands for redress. -That was no concern of mine. If they thought that no satisfactory settlement could be reached without the dismissal of Mr. Shuster, I could urge no objection. I did not wish to suggest the dismissal of Mr. Shuster, but I mentioned it lest there should be an impiession in St. Petersbuigh that I w r as prepossessed in his favour. As a matter of fact, he had given me endless trouble by his inconvenient appointments of British subjects in spite of all I coidd say to him. We were, however, deeply concerned as to the possible consequences of the action which the Russian Government might take, not so much the direct consequences as the ulterior consequences. The Russian Government intended to send troops to Kazvin. They contemplated sending on from there some force to Tehran. I heard from Sir George Barclay that M. Poklevsky said that, if a force were sent to Tehran it must be a large one some 2,000 men. This would mean an occupation of the capital of Persia. It was sure to have an effect upon the Mahometan world, and it was a most serious thing. I would therefore suggest that, when the Russian Government had sent the troops to Kazvin, they should pause, and formulate their demands upon the Persian Government. If further pressure became necessary, why should the Russian Government not seize some of the customs, or even impound the revenues of Tabreez ? This was the sort of pressure that was relevant to Mr. Shuster’s action. An occupation of the capital was bound to excite Mahometan feeling, and might react most unfavourably in India, especially if it were thought that we were in any way a consenting party to it. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. No. 123. Note communicated by M. de Etter, Not ember 17, 1911. LE Gouvernement britannique n’ignore pas que le Gonvernement persan avait revetu ces derniers temps, dans ses rapports avec la Russie, un caractere notoirement inamical et que la responsabilite de cette attitude doit retomber principalement sur le conseiller financier, Mr. Morgan Shuster, qui, depuis son arrivee en Perse, s’est pin systematiquement a ignorer les interets de la Russie. Le Gouvernement persan a perdu du terrain et s’est trouve, en grande partie, impuissant vis-a-vis de Mr. Shuster par suite de 1’appui dont il s’est assure aupres du Medjliss et du parti nationaliste. Un incident regrettable a surgi dernierement a Teheran, provoque par I’intention du Gouvernement persan de confisquer les proprietes des partisans de 1’ancien Chah Mohamed Ali, et, entre autres, celles du Prince Shao-es-Saltaneh, dans lesquelles des interets russes se trouvent engages. Mr. Shuster, charge d’executer cette mesure, y a encore precede dune fa$on provocante vis-a-vis de nous. Les gendarmes places sous ses ordres ne se sont pas seulement permis d’oecuper de force I’immeuble du Prince avant que les pourparlers a ce propos entre les representants de Mr. Shuster et le consul general de Russie aient pris fin, et de deloger les Cosaques persans auxquels etait confiee la garde de la maison, ils out de plus vise les representants du consulat general avec 1’intention evidente de decharger centre eux leurs fusils. De son cote, le Gouvernement persan—contrairement a toutes les traditions—s’est cm autorise a nous adresser deux notes exigeant le rappel du consul general et du personnel du consulat general de Russie. Jugeant ces aetes inadmissibles tant an point de vue du prestige que des interets de la Russie, le Gouvernement Imperial a charge le Ministre a Teheran, premierement, de renvoyer an Gouvernement persan les deux notes precitees et de lui notifier verbalement 1’exigence de remplacer les gendarmes financiers par les Cosaques persans [503] ' E50 jusqua ce qu’il soit etabli dans quelle mesure les interets des sujets russes se trouvent engages dans les proprietes de Shoa-es-Saltaneh; et, secondement, d’exiger que le Gouvernement persan fasse des excuses, par le Ministre des Affaires Etrangeres, pour le fagon de proceder des gendarmes persans. Contrairement a notre attente, ces exigences moderees ont ete rejetees par le Gouvernement persan, et, par suite, le Gouvernement Imperial s’est vu oblige de charger M. Poklewski de renouveler ses representations par ecrit, en ajoutant que nous nous attendons a ce que nos demandes soient executees sans le moindre retard, et que dans le cas contraire il cesserait tons rapports avec le Gouvernement persan, et que la Eussie se reserverait de prendre telles mesures qu’elle jugera necessaires. Aucune reponse n’ayant ete regue jusquici du Gouvernement persan, notre Ministre a regu l ordre de cesser tons rapports avec ce dernier. En meme temps, le Gouvernement Imperial, considerant que ses interets ont ete serieusement leses et que, par suite, une pression de sa part sur le Gouvernement persan s’imposait, a decide d’envoyer des maintenant a Kazvine un detachement se composant de differentes armes, en laissant an Ministre la faculte d’appeler a Teheran une force suffisante pour eloigner les gendarmes persans occupant actuellement la maisou et la propriete de Shoa-es-Saltaneh. Ces mesures, necessities par les circonstances susindiquees, revetent certainement un caractere purement provisoire. Aussitot que I’incident sera clos et que des garanties quant a Fattitude correcte idterieure vis-a-vis de nous du Gouvernement persan seront assurees, notre detachement sera rappele en Russie. Le compte rendu telegraphique sur la reponse, faite par Sir E. Grey a Finter- pellation an Parlement a cet effet, a ete tres favorablement accueilli par le Gouvernement Imperial. Nous considerons, de notre cote, que les mesures prises par nous ne sont nullement en contradiction avec le principe de notre entente avec FAngleterre pour les affaires de Perse, et nous sommes decides a ne pas devier de la ligne de conduite poursuivie jusqu’ici basee sur Fesprit de solidarite complete et de cooperation avec FAngleterre. • Ambassade Imperiale de Russie, Londres, le 4 (17) novembre, 1911. (Translation.) THE British Government are aware that the Persian Government have lately assumed a notoriously unfriendly attitude in their relations with Russia and that the responsibility for this attitude must fall principally on the financial adviser, Mr. Morgan Shuster, who since his arrival in Persia has been pleased systematically to ignore Russian interests. The Persian Government have lost ground and have found themselves to a great extent powerless against Mr. Shuster on account of the support which he has secured from the Medjliss and the Nationalist party. A regrettable incident has recently occurred at Tehran, caused by the intention of the Persian Government to confiscate the properties of the supporters of the ex-Shah Mohamed Ali, and amongst others that of Prince Shoa-es-Sultaneh, in which Russian interests are involved. Mr. Shuster, who was entrusted with the execution of this measure, proceeded in this case also in a fashion provocative to us. The gendarmes under his orders not only ventured forcibly to occupy the Prince’s property before the discussions on the subject between Mr. Shuster s representatives and the Russian consul-general had terminated and to dislodge the Persian Cossacks who had been told off to guard the house, but they took aim at the representatives of the consulate-general with the evident intention of firing their rifles at them. The Persian Government on their part, contrary to all traditions, thought them selves justified in addressing two notes to us demanding the recall of the Russian consul-general and of the staff of the consulate-general. Judging these acts to be inadmissible from the point of view both of the prestige and of the interests of Russia, the Imperial Government have instructed the Minister at lehran, firstly, to return to the Persian Government the two notes above mentioned and to notify to them verbally the necessity of replacing the financial gendarmes by Persian Cossacks until it has been established to what extent the interests of Russian subjects are involved in the property of Shoa-es-Sultaneh; and, secondly, to demand an51 iontmlk and lit I ,iicial afe ks to a ^ ie ks i* apology from the Persian Government through the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the proceedings of the Persian gendarmes. ^ Contrary to our expectation, these moderate demands have been rejected by the Peisian Government, and accordingly the Imperial Government have been obliged to instruct M. Poklewsky fc&gt; renew his representations in writing, adding that we expect our demands to be carried out without the least delay, and that failing this he would break off all relations with the Persian Government, and that Russia would reserve to herself the right to take such measures as she judged necessary. .No reply having yet been received from the Persian Government, our Minister has received instructions to break_ off all relations with them. At the same time the Imperial Government, considering that their interests had been seriously injured and that accordingly it was necessary to exercise pressure on the Persian Government, decided to send at once to Kazvin a detachment of different arms, leaving the Minister the power to summon to Tehran a force sufficient to expel the Persian gendarmes now in occupation of the house and property of Shoa-es-Sultaneh. These measures, which have been rendered necessary by the circumstances above referred to, are certainly of a purely provisional character. As soon as the incident is closed and guarantees have been secured for the correct attitude of the Persian Government towards us in the future, our detachment will be recalled to Russia. jThe telegraphic report of the answer given by Sir E. Grey to a question in Parliament on this subject has been cordially welcomed by the Imperial Government. We consider, on our part, that the measures we have taken in no way conflict with the principle of our entente with England respecting the affairs of Persia, and we are resolved not to deviate from the line of conduct pursued hitherto, which is based on a spirit of complete solidarity and co-operation with England.

ON the 29th October (the 11th November) of this year the Russian Minister at Tehran presented to the Persian Government a note demanding satisfaction for the attitude of the Persian authorities towards officials of the consulate-general at Tehran and their provocative action in the incident of the confiscation of the properties of Prince Shoa-es-Sultan eh in that town, the details of which incident are given in the official communication published on the subject. The note in question has remained without a reply from the Persian Government, which shows their clear intention to avoid compliance with our demand. 1 The Imperial Government have consequently ordered the Russian Minister to break off relations with the Cabinet of Tehran, and have taken steps to send to Persia a detachment of troops which is to concentrate at Kazvin, on the road to Tehran. . The above measures are of an absolutely provisional character, and the detachment will be recalled wdthout delay as soon as the incident in question has been settled and relations with Persia duly re-established.

C-hGi de^ cabinet of the late Minister for Foreign Affairs (who is still dischaigmg the duties of his ministry) has visited me, and I gather from him that a favourable reply will probably be returned to the Russian note, the Persian Cabinet having no alternative but to yield to force majeure. He brought me a message from the late Minister for Foreign Affairs stating that the Cabinet cusis, which he assured me would soon be over, was entirely responsible for the failure of the Persian Government to reply to the Russian note for so long. As soon as a new Cabinet was formed, it would at once proceed to draw up a'reply to the Russian note. If this reply were unsatisfactory to Russia the measures she contemplated would have to take their course. But if a favourable reply were to be given,^ there would no longer be any justification for Russia to take such action. The Minister for Foreign Affairs would therefore be grateful if I would appeal to His Majesty’s Government, on behalf of the Persian Government, to approach the Russian Government with the object of securing the suspension of the contemplated Russian action, to which, he pointed out, no term was specified in the Russian note.

(Telegraphic.) ^ St. Petersburgh, November 18, 1911. CONVEYS substance of the following extract from a despatch dated the 29th November : — I called on the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 18th instant, and, in accordance with the instructions contained in your telegram of the 16th instant, I spoke to his Excellency very seriously of the consequences which might result from a Russian occupation of Tehran. I urged him not to issue orders for an advance from Kazvin till all other means of exercising pressure on the Persian Government, such as the seizure of custom-houses, had been exhausted, and until sufficient time had elapsed to allow the occupation of Kazvin to produce its effect. I further reminded him how, in your desire to maintain the Anglo-Russian understanding intact, you had always tried to meet Russia’s wishes, and how you had repeatedly defended her action when it was criticised in Parliament. There was, however, an English public opinion of which you had to take account; and as, in spite of the provocation which Russia might have received, the fact remained that the Persian Cossacks had endeavoured to prevent the seizure of a property belonging to one of the leaders of the late insurrection, it would not be easy for you to justify an armed occupation of the capital on account of this incident. In the course of his reply, M. Neratof gave me the positive assurance that the principle on which the Anglo-Russian understanding was founded would be maintained intact, and that nothing which the Russian Government might do would strike at the integrity of Persia. He dismissed, however, the idea of exercising pressure by the seizure of custom-houses as being quite inadequate, and declined to grant the Persian Government any further delay after the arrival of the troops at Kazvin. He based this refusal on the grounds that the Russian Minister at Tehran had broken off diplomatic relations with the Persian Government, and that Russia could not without loss of prestige address any further communication to that Government. He rejected a proposal which I had made, that he should send a last warning message through the Persian charge d’affaires here, but raised no objection when I put forward the personal suggestion that Sir George Barclay might, perhaps, warn the Persian Government that we had been told that unless satisfaction was at once given to Russia, not only would Tehran be occupied, but that Russia’s demands would, as his Excellency had already informed me, be increased the further she advanced into the country. In referring to the incident to which the seizure of Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s property had given rise, M. Neratof said that the Russian Government had never disputed the right of the Persian Government to confiscate the property of persons who had taken part [503] E 354 in the late rebellion. They had acquiesced in principle in such a procedure, but in this particular case the Persian Government had failed to notify the Russian consulate- general that it was Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s property that was about to be seized, while the gendarmerie sent to take possession of it had carried off various implements belonging to the Russian farmers who had leased the property. This incident, however, was but one of a series of provocative measures that had been inspired by Mr. Shuster; and it was the cumulative effect of these acts that had forced the Russian Government to take action. I told his Excellency that if the occupation of Tehran by Russian troops were to lead to the overturn of the present regime, there was one thing to which His Majesty’s Government would never agree, namely, the return of the ex-Shah. His Excellency replied that the measures that Russia was taking were of a purely provisional character, and their sole object was to secuie the ledress of her grievances ; and on my enquiring what satisfaction the Persian Government could give to induce her to withdraw her troops, M. Neratof replied that she would recall them if she were notified of Mr. Shuster’s dismissal, and that were he to go, she would even abandon her demand with regard to the replacing of the Treasury gendarmes by Persian Cossacks on Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s property.

Sir, Tehran, October 27, 1911. I HAVE the honour to report that on receipt of your telegram in which you asked for my view on the suggestion of the Russian Government that Major Stokes might be employed to organise a gendarmerie at or near Ispahan, I enquired of Mr. Shuster what he thought of the idea. I enclose a copy of his reply the substance of which I reported in my telegram of the 5th October. I acquainted my Russian colleague with Mr. Shuster’s answer, and on the 15th instant he informed Mr. Shuster, under instructions from his Government, that as it was unfortunately found impossible to restrict Major Stokes’s services to the south, the Russian Government must adhere to their protest against his engagement to organise a Treasury gendarmerie. Mr. Shuster had previously threatened to publish' a statement of his case against the two Governments in the event of his being prevented from securing Major Stokes’s services, and on receipt of M. Poklewski’s communication of the 15th instant, he lost no time in communicating to Reuter’s correspondent a brief statement which I understand duly appeared in the London press. He has since, I am told, posted a more detailed indictment, which will presumably appear in the London press in a few days. Meanwhile Major Stokes stays on in Tehran, though I have urged him in a friendly manner to leave. His continued presence here may prove very inconvenient as he is staying with Mr. Shuster, and it can hardly be doubted that he is assisting him in the organisation of the Treasury gendarmerie. As I have already reported I should not be surprised if at any moment you were approached by the Russian Government with the request that he may be recalled. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. • -Vbj-iur” ; '55 Enclosure in No. 133. Mr. Shuster to Sir G. Barclay. Dear Sir George, Tehran, October 5, 1911. REGARDING your note of the 3rd, to which I was about to reply, let me say that the suggestion as to localising Stokes at Ispahan, is, of course, out of the question, both on principle and as a matter of practicability. I hope some day the British and Russian Foreign Offices will come to believe that when I said I wanted Stokes here in Tehran to assist me by his advice and peculiar knowledge in the formation of a Treasury gendarmerie, I meant just that and nothing more ; no arriere-pensee, no military expeditions, no intrigues, nothing but what I said. It seems impossible at times for one to gain any credence for a frank open statement of facts or intentions, but it is equally true that it was neither within the letter nor the spirit of my statement to go through the truly absurd performance of marooning him at Ispahan or anywhere else in order that he might advise and assist me here. Is it not about time, dear Sir George, that two big Governments stop playing at this matter, and state plainly whether they intend to continue to oppose the employment of Stokes along the lines which I have mentioned, or not ? With, &amp;c. W. MORGAN SHUSTER, Treasurer-General of Persia. No. 134. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 20.) Sir, Tehran, October 27, 1911. I HAVE the honour to report the Persian Government recently issued a decree confiscating the properties of the rebellious Princes Shoa-es-Sultaneh and Salar-ed- Dowleh. In execution of the decree, Mr. Shuster, the treasurer-general, on the 9th October, sent five of his gendarmerie to each of the six properties in Tehran and the suburbs affected by the decree. The gendarmes were instructed to take possession of the properties, and to draw special attention, if necessary, to an undertaking of the Persian Government that all rights of foreigners arising from contracts in connection with these properties would be wholly respected. One of the properties of the Shoa-es-Sultaneh is situated in the vicinity of the Russian consulate-general in the town. There the gendarmes found some Persian Cossacks in occupation. These had apparently been posted there by the Turkish Embassy (though this is not quite clear)—Shoa-es-Sultaneh being claimed by the Turkish Embassy as a Turkish subject. The Persian Cossacks objected to the entry of the gendarmes, who, however, proceeded into the house and commenced an inventory of its contents. Soon after, two officials of the Russian consulate-general, sent by M. Pokhitonow, the Russian consul-general, arrived and told the gendarmes they had no business to enter the property. The latter explained their mission, but the officials began to threaten them, and the gendarmes, not having instructions to meet such an eventuality, withdrew from the premises, chased up the street by the Russian Cossacks. Mr. Shuster at once wrote a letter to the Russian Minister, who was still at Zerguendeh, protesting against the action of the Russian consulate-general in regard to this incident, and m regard to others of a similar nature which occurred on the same day in connection with the seizure of other properties of Shoa-es-Sultaneh. On the following morning, the 10th October, Mr. Shuster sent his assistant, Mr. Cairns, accompanied by a force of fifty fiscal gendarmes with five^ officers and fifty mounted national gendarmes with three officers, under the command of Mr. Merrell, of the fiscal gendarmerie, with stringent instructions to take possession of the property in town by peaceful methods, if possible. If, however, violence were offered, the o-endarmes were to wait for their opponents to fire the first shot, but in any case they were to accomplish their mission and take possession of the garden and the house. When the expedition arrived at the gate of the property, Messrs. Cairns and Merrell went round to the Russian consulate, and were received by M. Pokhitonow, [503] E 456 the Russian consul-general. They read to him the order of confiscation, explained the instructions they had received, and while assuring him that the rights of foreign subjects would be respected, begged him to withdraw the force he had placed in the garden. According to the report of Mr. Merrell, M. Pokhitonow refused, but as far as I can ascertain it was the Turkish Embassy, and not M. Pokhitonow, which was responsible for the presence of the force in question, which consisted of Persian Cossacks only. Mr. Merrell went back to the gate, the six Persian Cossacks on guard refused him entrance. Mr. Merrell, however, found a way in by a side door, and his men disarmed the Cossacks, and the gendarmes remained quietly in possession. An attempt was made by the Cossacks to summon reinforcements from the brigade to their assistance, but Prince Yadbolski, the Russian commanding officer, refused to comply without the consent of the Minister of War or the Russian Minister. I have, &amp;c. C. BARCLAY. No. 135. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 20.) Sir, Tehran, October 28, 1911. SINCE my last despatch of the 4th instant respecting the insurrection, there has been little definite to report. The whereabouts of the ex-Shah have been the subject of many rumours. At one time it was confidently believed by the Persian Government that he was in Russian territory at Askhabad, where he vras believed to be staying with the governor. There appears to have been no more truth in this story than in the rumour telegraphed by His Majesty’s consul-general at Meshed that the ex-Shah had gone to Tashkent. I do not know that he has, since his flight to Gumesh Tepe, ever left the district of Astrabad. At any rate, he is there now, and some of his followers are reported to have gained a success quite recently over some Government troops near Bender Gez. Salar-ed-I)owleh, after the rout of his forces on the 27th ultimo, fled to the neighbourhood of Hamadan, and thence, on the approach of the Government troops, to Burujird. The tribesmen who composed his army have dispersed to their homes. Azad-es-Suitan, another brother of Mohamed Ali, whom Salar-ed-Dowleh had appointed governor of Kermanshah, took bast at the Turkish consulate in that town on learning the defeat of his brother, and has since left Kermanshah on his way, it is believed,^ to Kerbela. ^ Yeprim and his Armenians have returned to Tehran; the Bakhtiaris who were with him and who formed the bulk of the victorious army are now in Hamadan and its neighbourhood with the object of dealing with the aftermath of the insurrection, or, as is confidently asserted by those not friendly to them, for the purpose of unrestrained looting. There is talk of sending Yeprim against Shuja-ed-Dowleh at Tabreez. That chieftain still threatens the town, and though no fighting has been reported for some time Tabreez is still almost completely invested, a state of things which is producing a serious situation, and prices of provisions are reported to be rising to a famine level. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 136. Si?‘ G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 20.) ^ r ’ Tehran, October SI, 1911. A1111 reference to my despatch of the 2nd October respecting the state of insecunhy on the southern roads, I have had the honour to keep you informed in my recent telegranm respecting the reinforcement of the consular escorts of the desperate state m which the channels of communication between the Persian Gulf and Central 1 ersia continue to remain. Besides the concrete instances of robberies of British goods reported in my telegrams of the 14th and of the 22nd October, I still continue to receive the same reports fiom His Majesty s consuls in the places affected of caravans held up or com pelled to follow devious routes at ruinous rates for transport fodder and protection,ulnle the telegraph gholams are being constantly stripped and beaten, and the telegraph matenrf destroyed or stolen. Villages in all directions are pillaged by hist one tribe and then by another set of bandits, until the inhabitants of the country or travellers 1 not ^ mg e l to t ' lem to ^ ve on except the pillaging of passing trade Now that His Majesty’s Government have shown their sense of the seriousness of the prevalent disorder by the significant increase in the consular guards it may be hoped that a temporary moral effect will be produced on at least those marauders who are under more or less responsible leaders, such as the Kashgais, the Kuhgeluis and the Bakhtians, and that a diminution of disorder on the roads may have to be noted while the I ersian Government are devising the effective scheme on which they have been told the inaction of our troops as regards the policing of the roads will depend. His Majesty s consul at Kerman, however, expresses the fear that effective measures on the Bushire—Ispahan road will lead to the robbers transferring their activity to the already unsafe Kerman-Bunder Abbas route.

No. 138. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received November 20.) Sir, Tehran, November 1, 1911. THE course of the Cabinet has been by no means smooth during the past few weeks owing to the severe tension between the Ministers and the treasurer-general. A sharp letter was addressed by Mr. Shuster to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which he complained of Vosuk-ed-Lowleh’s action in settling two trifling Russian claims without his consent. Vosuk-ed-Dowleh considered the letter so offensive that he immediately tendered his resignation, which was followed by that of two of his colleagues. Realising, however, that his action was likely to lead to the upsetof the whole Ministry, and that he was thus playing into the hands of Mr. Shuster’s extremist supporters, he resumed office, and his example was followed by his two colleagues. Since then there have been further resignations, amongst them that of Hakim- ul-Mulk, Minister of Finance, who it appears was compelled to take this course by the difficulties of his position between the clamours of his colleagues for money on the one side and Mr. Shuster’s tight hold of the purse-strings on the other. Hakim-ul-Molk’s place has not yet been tilled, and, indeed, the post of a Minister of Finance, controlled by Mr. Shuster in a Ministry which cannot reconcile itself to the wholesome restrictions placed by Mr. Shuster on expenditure, is a very difficult one, and it may well not be easy to find anyone willing to undertake it. The Prime Minister is said to be seeking someone who can stand up to Mr. Shuster. Such a one will be hard to find. There has been much talk of curtailing by a vote of the Medjliss the powers conferred upon Mr. Shuster by the law of the 13th June. It was, indeed, decided to have a discussion in the Medjliss as to the means of diminishing his powers, but the discussion never took place, for when at the sitting of the 23rd instant the Ministers proposed that the Medjliss should go into secret session to discuss matters of importance, the democrats, seeing what was coming, left the House in a body, so that there was no quorum. Since then as a result of several meetings between Mr. Shuster and the Cabinet, the idea of curtailing the treasurer-general’s powers has been abandoned, and a modus vivendi seems to have been arrived at, though it is idle to hope that the tension between Mr. Shuster and the present Cabinet will disappear. It must, indeed, I fear, be chronic except in the unpleasant and even dangerous contingency of the advent to power of a Cabinet of ultra-Nationalists, who, however troublesome and dangerous they may be, are the only section of public men in Persia imbued with any real spirit of reform. The vacant posts 'in the Cabinet can doubtless be filled, but I fear that a strong Ministry is an impossibility unless it has the backing of Mr. Shuster, and unfortunately to find a Cabinet which could really work in harmony with him recourse would have to be had to the extremists, and such a Cabinet would probably soon provoke Russia beyond endurance. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 139. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey. — (Received November 20.) Sir, Tehran, November 2, 1911. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia for the past four weeks. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 139. Summary of Events in Persia for October. Tehran. Military Operations, —The defeat of Salar-ed-Dowleh on the 27th September forms the subject of a separate despatch. Amir Mufakham, Sardar Jang and Moin Humayun have since returned to Tehran, while Sardar Mohtashem, Sardar Zafar, and Sardar Bahadur remained in the vicinity of Hamadan. Yeprem, who has received the title of “ Sardar,” returned to Tehran on the 22nd October. The Medjliss. —The electoral law has at last been passed by the Medjliss. It provides for direct elections and 136 deputies instead of 120. On the 5th October a motion, signed by forty-one deputies asking the Government to lay before the House all documents in their possession relating to reactionary intrigues and plots, was read, but so far the demand has not been responded to by the Ministers. On the 15th October a telegram was read which had been addressed by MullahMohamed Kazini Khoiassani, the chief of the Ulema of Nejef, to the Regent and the Medjliss, protesting against the alleged disregard at Tehran of religious interdictions. The telegram has apparently not received much attention. Tabreez. At the end of September two English employes of the Indo-European Telegraph Company, who, at the request of the Russian consul-general, were a short distance from Tabreez repairing the line, were fired upon by some rebels. No one was injured, and the incident is now closed. The investment of the town by Shuja-ed-Dowleh continues, and in the middle ol October some serious fighting occurred, when the Nationalists attacked the Karamalik suburb, which was held by the rebels, and lost twenty-five killed and thirty wounded. It is reported by His Majesty’s consul that, according to trustworthy information, Rahim Khan, the notorious Royalist outlaw, has been secretly executed in prison at Tabreez. Mujallal-es-Sultan, the ex-Shah’s chamberlain, who landed in Persia at the same time as the late Arshad-ed-Dowleh, has been sent to Maragha as a prisoner by Shuja- ed-Dowleh in consequence of dissensions in camp. Ghilan and Mazanderan. On the 20th October a telegram was received from the British consular agent at Astrabad, reporting that the ex-Shah ’was at Khoja Nafas, which is a few miles south of Gumesh Tepe. On the 30th October he telegraphed the news of the defeat of a Government force consisting of 200 men under Sardar Moby, by the ex-Shah’s Turko mans. Sardar Moby is said to have fled, and Astrabad is reported to be in danger of an attack by the Turkomans. Zahir-ed-Dowleh, the new governor for Ghilan, has left Tehran for his post. At the end of October a little over 100 Russian Cossacks were landed at Enzeli to increase the consular guard. Meshed. Prince Rukn-ed-Dowleh has been definitely appointed Governor-General of Khorassan, and proposes to leave Tehran for Meshed shortly. The state of the province has continued quiet, the town of Meshed has not been disturbed, but the roads are, as usual, infested with robbers. Nishapur has been placed under Khorassan, but Prince Nayer-ed-Dowleh, who is the principal landed proprietor of the district, is endeavouring to separate it again and to obtain the governorship as before. Ispahan. Some caravans have actually attempted to do the journey between Ispahan and Shiraz and vice versa. One caravan of about 400 animals reached Ispahan in the middle of September, having taken the Sarhad route and was not molested anywhere. There are constant reports of robberies on the road between Ispahan and Kumisheh attributed to Kuhgeluis. A large camel caravan arrived safely on the 2nd October with piece-goods from Hamadan. Traffic has been suspended for some time on the Ispahan-Ahwaz (Bakhtiari) road, and on the 7th October there were 2,174 packages awaiting downward dispatch from Ispahan. A caravan of over 800 camels carrying pipe tobacco actually left Ispahan, but hearing reports of robbers on the road, the camelmen dropped their loads and returned to Ispahan. The governor, Sardar Ashja Bakhtiari, is said to leave most of the cares of State to his subordinates, who are greedy and unprincipled. The local anjuman ceased to sit after the arrival of the present governor in May last. Hayder Khan, the Caucasian terrorist, returned from Shiraz on his way to Tehran at the end of September with a band of armed followers. He and his companions were disarmed at Ispahan. Miss Ross, a lady doctor, was attacked by robbers while travelling from Ispahan to Shiraz, robbed of all her effects, and subjected to personal violence. On the 20th October it was reported that the post from Shiraz to Ispahan accompanied by 300 soldiers of the Hamadan regiment encountered 200 Kuhgeluis, near Yezdikhast, and were routed by them after a severe conflict.60 Various robberies of British merchandise are reported, and the usual claims have been presented to the local authorities. The Boir Ahmedis attacked a village in the vicinity of Abadeh in the middle of October, and completely looted it. The detachments of Persian Cossacks under two Russian officers, which was sent from Tehran against Naib Hussein at Kashan, arrived at its destination on the 13th October, and after bombarding the town entered it the following day to find that Naib Hussein had again managed to get away. Ten days later Naib Hussein was reported to be in the vicinity of Kum plundering the villages as usual. The Bakhbiaris who are returning to their homes from Tehran are reported to be robbing travellers and posts on the road. Y ezd. Prince Amir Azam, the Governor of Kerman, succeeded in entering Yezd at the beginning of October, in spite of the resistance of the mob. Some executions followed, and the acting British vice-consul reported that the town was quiet. Sultanabad. The British vice-consul reported on the 11th October that the state of the district was unsettled, and that in some parts taxes were still being collected for the Salar-ed- Dowleh, who was then on his way to Luristan via Malair and Nehavend with from 5,000 to 6,000 followers. Haji Seif-ed-Dowleh, a brother of Ain-ed-Dowleh, who had been nominated Governor of Sultanabad by Salar-ed-Dowleh, took refuge at the British vice-consulate after the defeat of the Prince, but subsequently left for Tehran. Shiraz. Nizam-es-Sultaneh and Soulet-ed-I)owleh left Shiraz on their way south on the 5th October, and Kawam-ul-Mulk left His Majesty’s consulate the following day. It was generally thought that Nizam and Soulet left the town in consequence of the warnmg conveyed to them by His Majesty’s Minister. The situation in the town of Shiraz was at once relieved, and Kawam-ul-Mulk took over the administration of the province on behalf of Ala-ed-Dowleh, wffiose appointment as Governor-General of Pars and the Gulf ports was publicly announced at Shiraz on the 10th October. Soulet-ed-Dowleh, before leaving Shiraz, openly declared his intention of disturbing the Bushire road, and this threat he carried out. The accounts of the depredations of his followers are too numerous to report. The telegraph lines have been much damaged by the Kashgais and other tribesmen both to the north and to the south of Shiraz, and men sent out to repair them have been robbed and ill-treated. The robberies of British goods on the southern roads are too numerous to catalogue. Nizam-es-Sultaneh and Soulet-ed-Dowleh parted company after leaving Shiraz. The former 'went as far as Daliki, and then returned to Konartakhteh, while the latter remained in the vicinity of Jerreh. The Persian Government have issued a proclamation proscribing Nizam-es-Sultaneh and forfeiting his estates. It is their intention to capture him if possible. Soulet-ed- Dowleh has been dismissed from the post of Ilkhani of the Kashgais, and his brothei, Zaigham-ed-Dowleh, has been appointed to succeed him. He left Tehran on the 26th October for Shiraz. Ala-ed-Dowleh has not yet left Tehran, but says he will go as soon as the treasurer-general transfers a sum of money to Shiraz which is required for the payment of the Arab forces there. This Mr. Shuster has, so far, refused to do, fearing that the money will be squandered. The treasurer-general has engaged Mr. Alexander Schindler, formerly of the staff of the Imperial Bank, and proposes to send him as his representative to Shiraz to supervise the expenditure of money trans ferred in this way. It is announced by the Persian Government that a large force will accompany Ala-ed-Dowleh to Shiraz, and that they will include the Cossack detachment now at Kashan. The garrison of 5,000 troops stationed there last March have melted away unpaid, with the exception of some 300, who clamour fitfully for nine months arrears of pay and have now taken “bast” outside the British consulate. Seistan. The roads which continue to be unsafe all round Seistan are now also reported unsafe in southern and western Kainat.Baluchi raiders have been active on the western borders of the Kainat, but the new Government delegate. Nassir-es-Sultaneh, is taking steps to deal with them. Kerman. His Majesty’s consul writes on the 7th September that the condition of the province of Kerman is worse than at any time since his arrival in May 1910. The local government has hardly any power in the town and practically none in the province. The prices of bread and meat are rising, and the people are growing uneasy. The new governor is still at Yezd. Three robberies occurred in September on the Bunder Abbas road and the property of some Hindu merchants was robbed. The post is constantly being robbed on the Yezd, Bunder Abbas, and other roads. Kermanshdh and Hamadan. On the 8th October a telegram arrived from Hamadan, addressed by the Bakhtiari khans, Sardar Zafar and Sardar Jang, to the clergy and merchants of Kermanshah, announcing their arrival there, and instructing them to detain Azad-es-Sultan, the governor nominated by Salar-ed-Dowleh. The Prince having been warned fled to the Turkish consulate. On the telegram becoming known, the populace robbed any Kalhurs whom they found in the streets. Azad-es-Sultan eventually left the town and proceeded in the direction of Bagdad. Salar-ed-Dowleh left Hamadan by the Tusirkan road on the 3rd October with a small following, which looted the villages on the way. On the 4th the Government forces arrived at Showarin, near Hamadan, and looted the houses of Amir Afkham and his sons, Ehtesham-ed-Dowleh and Hissam-ul- Mulk. Sardar Zafar assumed the post of Governor of Hamadan. On the 15th Sardar Mozaffar (Daoud Khan, chief of the Kalhurs) left the vicinity of Kermanshah for his tribal quarters. Letters were received from Salar-ed-Dowleh on the 13th October, written from Luristan, directing that forces should be collected and sent to join him. In answer he was invited to come himself to Kermanshah. Bushire. The Indian cavalry for Shiraz arrived on the 27th October, and the disembarkation was completed by the 30th without casualty. An attempt was made by some of the clergy of Bushire to cause a boycott by intimidating the boatmen and others, but this was eventually overcome. The governor of the Gulf ports, Muvakkar-ed-Dowleh, has telegraphed to Ala-ed- Dowleh that the inclusion of his governorship in the Pars appointment is very detrimental to his prestige and usefulness. He has declared that he will resign if the arrangement is not reversed. If Ala-ed-Dowleh actually goes to Shiraz he will probably reappoint Darya Beggi to the Gulf ports. Bunder Abbas. The road to Kerman has been closed to caravans owing to the appearance of robbers on it. No. 140. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Beceived November 20.) Sir, Tehran, November 3, 1911. I HAVE the honour to forward to you herewith copies of two notes which I addressed to the Persian Government on the receipt of your telegram of the 23rd ultimo and of subsequent correspondence 'on the subject of the increase of the consular escorts at Bushire, Ispahan, and Shiraz. I have, &amp;c.Enclosure 1 in No. 140. Sir G. Barclay to Vosuk-ed-Dowleh. M. le Ministre, Tehran, October 24, 1911. REFERRING to my note of the 10th October and to your Excellency’s notes of the 11th and 18 th October, I have the honour to inform your Excellency that the reinforcements for the consular escorts have now started from India, and are now due to arrive shortly at Bushire. I shall have the honour to inform your Excellency in due course how these reinforcements will be distributed, and, in the meantime, I am to assure your Excellency that if the Persian Government will devise an effective scheme to restore security and protect the roads the British consular escorts will be used solely as consular guards to protect the consulates and British lives and property in the towns where they are located, and will not patrol the roads or make expeditions during the putting into execution of the Persian scheme. When such scheme is in operation and is effective the reinforcements of the escorts will be withdrawn. I avail, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 2 in No. 140. Sir G. Barclay to Vosuk-ed-Dowleh. M. le Ministre, Tehran, October 24, 1911. WITH reference to my note of to-day, announcing the impending arrival at Bushire of reinforcements of the British consular escorts, I have the honour to request that the necessary orders may be given for the usual customs facilities for these troops. I also request your Excellency to be so good as to cause the necessary instructions to be sent to the governor of the Gulf ports to afford his full co-operation to His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire in connection with the landing of these troops and for the dispatch northwards of such of them as are intended for Shiraz and Ispahan. I avail, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 3 in No. 140. Sir G. Barclay to Vosnk-ed-Dowleh. M. le Ministre, Tehran, October 26, 1911. WITH reference to my two notes of the 24th instant respecting the arrival at Bushire of reinforcements of the consular escorts at the consulate-general at that port and at the British consulates at Shiraz and Ispahan, I have the honour to inform your Excellency that the governor of the Gulf ports has informed His Majesty’s consul- general at Bushire that, though he has asked for instructions, he has not received them, and that he is therefore unable to co-operate with the consul-general in connection with the landing of reinforcements. I learn, too, that boatmen and others have been intimidated, and that endeavours are being made to provoke an agitation against the landing of British troops. I need not point out to your Excellency the serious consequences of any opposition to the landing of the British troops, but I must request your Excellency to be good enough to send immediate instructions to the governor of the Gulf ports to afford his full co-operation to His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire and to do his utmost to prevent any agitation against the troops. I avail, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 4 in No. 140. Vosuk-ed-Dowleh to Sir G. Barclay. Your Excellency, • Tehran, October 30, 1911. I HAVE taken note of the contents of your Excellency’s communication of the 24th October respecting the arrival of reinforcements for the consular guard, and I havethe honour to say that the Persian Government maintain their protest against this measure, as made to your Excellency in my notes of the 11th and 18th instant. The Persian Government continue to consider the presence of these reinforcements as the greatest obstacle to the execution of the scheme which they had elaborated for the maintenance of order in Ears. Therefore, I have the honour to point out that, in spite of the disorder caused by the conflict between the inhabitants, tbe continuance of which was only due to the fact that the Government were occupied in dealing with unusual events in the north and west, the Persian Government do not see any justification for the dispatch of a military force by His Britannic Majesty’s Government for the protection of their consulates. As 1 have already often stated to your Excellency, the Persian Government consider that the scheme they have formulated for the main tenance of order and for the protection of the lives and property of British subjects in those parts is sufficient, and they consider their former protest to be in full force. 1 avail, Ac. VOSUK-ED-DOWLEH. Enclosure 5 in No. 140. Vosuk-ed-Dowleh to Sir G. Barclay. Your Excellency, Tehran, October 30, 1911. I HAVE received your Excellency’s note of the 26th instant respecting the arrival at Bushire of reinforcements for the consular guards, and I have the honour to inform you that the necessary telegrams on the subject have been sent to the Governor of Bushire. With regard, however, to the agitation amongst the inhabitants which your Excellency had asked me to prevent, I may point out that no Government can stop public feelings, and it is impossible for the Government to do so in the present case. When it was pointed out in my notes of the 11th and 18th instant that the arrival of the consular guards would interfere with the execution of the proposed organisation, it was not only considered that it would weaken the Government’s scheme, but public excitement, which might lead to new difficulties, had also been foreseen. Now that indications of public excitement have become evident the Persian Government will do their utmost to prevent public opposition, but your Excellency will surely admit that public disgust and similar feelings cannot be prevented, as they are the manifestation of personal sentiment. I avail, &amp;c. VOSUK-ED-DOWLEH. No. 141. Mirza Mehdi Khan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 20.) THE Persian Minister presents his compliments to Sir Edward Grey, and, with reference to his calls at the Foreign Office regarding the recent policy of Russia towards Persia, has the honour to enclose the translation of a telegram, which he has just received from his Government, regarding the decision of the Russian Government to dispatch troops to Persia. The Persian Minister begs most earnestly to recommend this matter to Sir Edward Grey’s immediate attention. He will call at the Foreign Office to-morrow (Monday) morning. In order that there should be no loss of time he has at once sent to Sir Edward Grey the telegram from his Government. Persian Legation, London, November 19, 1911. Enclosure in No. 141. Persian Government to Mirza Mehdi Khan. (Translation.) in inj1 (Telegraphic.) n 1 n November \B, mi. THE interpreter of the Russian Legation called yesterday at o o clock at the Foreign Office, and announced the breaking off of diplomatic relations between the64 legation and this Foreign Office and the dispatch of troops to Persia. I have informed Sir George Barclay that the reply to the Russian Minister has not been put off; the delay in replying was due solely to the crisis in the Cabinet. The new Cabinet will be formed to-night, or, at the latest, to-morrow morning, when the reply to the note will be sent. The Russian Government should therefore refrain from taking any measures until the reply of the note is sent. When the Cabinet is formed and the the demands of the Russian Government are accepted, under /emce majeure, there can no longer be any cause for the breaking off of diplomatic relations and for dispatch of troops. We depend strongly on His Britannic Majesty’s Government to prove at this hour their ancient and traditional friendship. No. 142. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 20.)

Hope of Minister for Foreign Affairs as to speedy solution of crisis has not been fulfilled, Medjliss objecting in a session late last night to proposed new Cabinet.

Tehran, November 20, 1911. YOUR telegram of the 30th October. Sepoy guard left Shiraz on the 18th November. Acting consul reports that two Japanese subjects who had been informed that sepoys could not be responsible for their safety, and who were travelling ahead of the guard, were completely stripped yesterday by a large party of Boir Ahmedis near Dastarjin. Acting consul has ordered sepoys not to advance until a local Persian force, dispatch of which he is endeavouring to arrange for, has occupied neighbouring hills, and to return to Zinian if there is any doubt as to their getting through safely. I have approved. No. 145. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) ^ ^ A\ E have every reason to believe that if Persian Government comply with .Russian demands Russian troops will be withdrawn. ^ ou should let Persian Government know of this and point out that no time should be lost in complying with Russian demands.65 No. 146. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 20.) M. Neratof expressed great satisfaction at this communication. In discussing- the question when the Russian troops would eventually he withdrawn, M. Neratof gave me to understand that they would be withdrawn without Russia presenting any iurther demands ]f the demands already formulated were complied with by the time that the Russian force reached Persian territory. If, on the other hand, the troops had to proceed beyond the frontier, then it might be necessary for Russia to increase her demands, and she would then probably insist on Shuster being r ho m i a a ^ THE Persian Minister came to see me to-day and spoke at length regarding the advance of Russian troops. . With, regard to the merits of the case, I told him that I could not discuss the subject ^ since the interest in the property involved was Russian and not British; Shuster s attitude, however, has generally been so regardless of Russia, I might even say, so provocative, that one could hardly expect Russia to regard the incident leniently. The Persian Minister then asked me for my advice. I told him that Persian Government had no choice but to comply with two Russian demands for a formal apology and substitution of Persian Cossacks for Treasury gendarmes. I added that such compliance should be made at once, as time was lost by making conditions. He answered that the Persian Government would instantly comply with these two demands, and that he was in a position to promise that compliance would be carried out if they received an assurance that Russian troops would not advance further, and if we would intervene for the purpose. He pointed out that his Goverement’s position would be untenable if they complied and troops were not withdrawn. I said that 1 could not give any assurance on Russia’s behalf regarding Russian troops, and that I did not suppose she would admit official intervention on a point in which, as I understood, she considered her honour to be involved; all I could do was to make known at St. Petersburgh what the Persian Minister had said. You should inform Minister for Foreign Affairs that I was left with the impression that a settlement can be effected, and that, if Russian Government desire it, I am ready to communicate their views formally.

St. Petersburgh, November 21, 1911. CONVEYS the substance of the following extract from a despatch dated the 29th November:— On the receipt of your telegram of the 20th instant I called on M. Neratof, and. communicated to him what you had said to the Persian Minister, adding that the latter had given you the impression that a settlement could be effected, and that you were ready, if the Imperial Government desired it, to communicate their views formally to the Persian Government. M. Neratof said that the Persian Minister’s communication was very important, as showing the disposition of his Government, and desired me to thank you for your offer to act as intermediary. If the Russian troops had not disembarked before satisfaction had been given to Russia’s demands it might he possible, he thought, to give the Persian Government the assurance which they had asked for ; but this was a question on which he would have to consult the President of the Council. It would nevertheless be to the interests of both our Governments were the present incident to be used for the purpose of establishing a normal state of affairs at Tehran. The constitution was at present being worked in a one-sided manner, and the Medjliss had arrogated to itself executive powers to which it had no right. It was necessary, in his opinion, to restrict the r61e of that Chamber to that of a purely legislative assembly, to constitute a Senate, and to increase the powers of the Regent. It would, moreover, be most desirable to procure the dismissal of Mr. Shuster, as, so long as he remained at Tehran, pending questions like that of the appointment of Mr. Lecofifre would never be settled, while even were that appointment now to be cancelled there was no guarantee that similar ones would not be made in the future. I replied that if the Russian troops were to be retained in Persia till this programme had been carried through, they would have to remain there for months, and I suggested that when M. Poklewski received the visit of apology from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, he might state that the troops had been recalled in the hope that the Persian Government would now come to an arrangement with them for the settlement of all outstanding questions and for placing relations on a friendly and stable basis. I added that in such a case I was sure that you would give him all the support you could. M. Neratof replied that he was as anxious as you were for the recall of the troops, but that when once this step was taken there would be no guarantee against the recurrence of other incidents entailing the dispatch of further troops.

N^ratof informed me on the 22nd instant that he had communicated to the President of the Council all that I had told him, but that, as a portion of the troops had already arrived at Enzeli, it had been decided at a Cabinet Council held on the preceding evening that it was impossible to recall them till some guarantee had been obtained with regard to the future. M. Neratof explained that it had never been intended to exclude a discussion with the Persian Government for the purpose of arriving at a settlement of all outstanding questions. His Excellency also observed that the dispatch of troops had not only been very inconvenient to the Russian Government, but had involved great expense, and they would have to raise the question of the cost of the expedition. I subsequently pressed M. Neratof at any rate to prevent the troops advancing beyond Pesht; but though he gave me a vague and conditional assurance on the subject, it was clear from his subsequent language that the Russian Government are determined not to withdraw their troops till they have got rid of Mr. Shuster, even if they must send their troops to Tehran to expel him. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. No. 155. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 22, 1911. YOU should without delay communicate substance of Sir G. Barclay’s telegrams of yesterday and to-day to Minister for Foreign Affairs, so as to endeavour to render unnecessary the disembarkation of troops, since the Persian Government have apparently agreed to one of Russian demands. It is of the utmost importance that if Russian demands are complied with troops should not be landed, or if disembarked should at once be re-shipped. I am quite ready to discuss with Russian Government any proposals they may have to make in regard to promoting a more stable condition of affairs in Persia, and for the avoidance of any further acute differences.

THE Persian Minister called on the 18th instant, and asked for confirmation of the reported advance on Kazvin.

At yesterday’s session of the Medjliss a letter was read from the Prime Minister introducing an incomplete Cabinet: the late Minister for Foreign Affairs resumes his portfolio. He was too unwell to be present at the sitting : I am, however, assured that as soon as he is well enough, which he hopes will be to-day, he will tender an apology to the Russian Legation. Persian Government inform me that the formalities for checking the inventory of movables will take four days, or possibly longer : the gendarmes cannot therefore be withdrawn from the property at once. I have on repeated occasions impressed on the Persian Government that the chance of a withdrawal of the Russian troops becomes smaller with every moment’s delay. No. 159. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 23.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, November 23, 1911. CONVEYS the substance of the following extract from a despatch dated the 29th November:— On the evening of the 23rd instant, M. Neratof sent for me and told me that, according to a telegram which he had received from M. Poklewski, the new Persian Government consisted of only three Ministers, and had only a provisional mandate ; that the Persian Cossacks were not to replace the Treasury gendarmes for another four or five days, and that until this change had been effected, M. Poklewski could not receive the visit of apology that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was to pay him. Finally, Mr. Shuster had, his Excellency said, caused a Persian pamphlet dealing with the recent incident to be circulated broadcast for the purpose of stirring up an anti-Russian agitation. This was a proceeding which the Russian Government could not tolerate, and instructions would be sent to M. Poklewski, after a Council of Ministers to be held the next evening, to demand his dismissal. Such a demand, when once presented, must, his Excellency added, be enforced at all costs. M. Poklewski would also be instructed to demand the cancelling of Mr. Lecoffre’s appointment, as well as a declaration to the effect that in future no subject of any of the Great Powers would be appointed to any important post in the Persian service, and that no foreigner of any nationality would be employed in such a capacity without previous consultation with the two legations. I endeavoured, though unsuccessfully, to induce his Excellency to delay the dispatch of these instructions till I was in receipt of your views with regard to them. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. No. 160. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 23, 1911. SEE your telegram of yesterday.. You should urge on Russian Government that the troops which are already in Persia should at all events not be allowed to advance when once Persian Government have agreed to Russian demands, that diplomatic relations at Tehran should be resumed, and that no further troops should be dispatched. If the above requests were agreed to, a discussion might take place^ between ourselves and Russia as to what changes are required at Tehran in order to give better security to Russian interests. ^ ^ F 3 y [503]70 No. 161. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 24.) Tehran, November 12, 1911. AS reported in my telegram of the 2nd November, Russian Minister, under instructions from his Government, demanded on that day from the Persian Government that the Treasury gendarmes should be withdrawn from the^town property and replaced by Persian Cossacks, and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should formally apologise for an incident which had occurred after the gendarmes had taken possession. The Russian Minister also returned the note in which the Persian Government had demanded the recall of Pokhitonow, as well as a rejoinder which the Persian Govern ment had made to M. Poklewski’s reply to the note in question. On the 5th instant a Cabinet Council was held to consider the reply to the Russian demands and it was decided, practically unanimously as I understand, to reject them. The demands had been made verbally, and the reply, which was given on the 6th instant, was also verbal. I enclose a copy of ^ it as taken down at the Russian Legation. You will observe that it is implied in the Persian Government’s reply that the Russian Legation had had due notice of the seizures, and it is stated that they had been assured that Russian rights would be respected. I believe this is so far accurate that the Persian Government had informally intimated to the Russian Minister that the estates of certain reactionaries were to be confiscated, and assurances were given that any proper Russian claim would be met, but Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s name was not specifically mentioned by the Persian Government, and it would, no doubt, have been'more regular, had the Persian Govern ment known that there were any Russian rights involved, that they should have given notice of the date and hour at which the seizure was to be effected, and should have invited the co-operation of the Russian consulate-general. Yesterday the Russian Minister, under orders from St. Petersburgh, demanded, in writing, satisfaction of the Russian demands, and intimated to the Persian Govern ment, verbally, that unless this were given without delay he would break off relations with the present Cabinet, and Russia would take such measures as might be necessary to protect her own interests. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 161. Reply of Persian Government to Russian Demands made verbally on November 2. THE Imperial Government of Persia, desirous as ever of maintaining the most friendly relations with the Government of His Majesty the Emperor, after a most careful consideration of the proposals made by your Excellency, in effect that the Government’s agents now occupying certain properties recently confiscated from the rebellious Persian subject Shoa-es-Sultaneh, should be removed and should be replaced by the former guard of Persian Cossacks, and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should, in person, present himself at the Russian Legation, and tender an apology for an offence alleged to have been given to officers of the Russian consulate-general in Tehran, make, in reply thereto, the following observations : Whereas, the Persian authorities had taken care to notify beforehand the Russian Legation that the interests of Russian subjects would be safeguarded, and, moreover, on the second day of the incident, reiterated the Government’s decree to the Russian consul-general, requesting, as they had a right to do, that no hindrance or intervention on the part of any member of the consulate- general should be tolerated, and further, seeing that the policy of this Government is one of friendship and conciliation towards Russia, in which sense they are endeavouring to direct the course of public opinion ; and whereas, on the other hand, compliance with your Excellency’s verbal proposition, in spite of the innocence of the Imperial Govern ment’s agents, would not only violate the dignity and honour of the country, but would also be incompatible with the said policy of friendship and co-operation, the Imperial Government of Persia find it impossible to acquiesce in the above proposals. Apprehending, however, that a misunderstanding as to the real facts of the case still clings to the mind of the Imperial Government of Russia, and with a view to completely demonstrating their good will, the Persian Government court a full andimpartial investigation of the facts in order that all possible ground for misapprehension might be removed. I am to state, in conclusion, that the Imperial Government of Persia cannot fail to express regret at the action taken by your Excellency’s Government in returning the protest heretofore lodged by the Persian Government with your Excellency. November 6, 1911. No. 162. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 24.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 24, 1911. PLEASE see my telegrams of the 22nd and 23rd instant. The “ chef de cabinet ” of the Minister for Foreign Affairs sent me a private letter yesterday afternoon to the effect that the Persian Government had lost no time in acting on the advice given them by His Majesty’s Government as regards compliance with the Russian demands, on the express understanding that the Russian troops would then be withdrawn. He stated that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was prepared to tender a formal apology to the Russian Legation, and that Persian Cossacks would replace the Treasury gendarmes this evening in the property in question. I pointed out to him at once that there was no express understanding. I reminded him of the wording of your telegram of the 20th instant, and added that when I used your words on the morning of the 22nd November, they correctly expressed the state of the case as it then stood. No. 163. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 24.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 24, 1911. THE Russian Minister received the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the Russian Legation this afternoon, when his Excellency tendered the formal apology demanded by the Russian Government. Persian Cossacks have replaced the Treasury gendarmes on the^principal property, and they will also replace Treasury gendarmes on the other properties this evening. As soon as the Minister for Foreign Affairs had apologised, M. Poklewski informed his Excellency that his Government had authorised him to resume diplomatic relations, but he added his personal opinion that his Government vmild not be entirely satisfied wdth the compliance with their two original demands. He reminded his Excellency of the great delay shown by the Persian Government in giving satisfaction, in consequence of vilich Russian troops had already been landed ; and he added that, since the original demands had been presented, Shuster had had translations of his recent letter to the press made, and had distributed them broadcast among the people. He thought the Russian Government would formulate some further demands and present them to the Persian Government. No. 164. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 24.) (Telegraphic.)

Poklewski informs me that his Government having enquired his views as to means of procuring the dismissal of the treasurer-general, he replied on the 21st November that he did not think that diplomatic^ pressure would be likely to effect this object Russian Minister added that if Russian Government decided to formulate fresh demands and to employ troops to enforce their acceptance, he believed that the course most likely to put relations between Russia and Persian Government on a more stable basis whatever might be the decision of the Russian Government with regard to [503] F 472 Shuster, would be to utilise the presence of the troops to force Persian Government to recognise Anglo-Russian Convention in a formula previously agreed upon by Great Britain and Russia. The comprehensive demand suggested by my Russian colleague is, I think preferable, if troops are to be employed to secure compliance to the pressing of several particular demands. No. 165. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received November 24.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, November 24, 1911. MY telegram of the 23rd November. I have to-day written privately to M. Neratof pointing out that the Russian proposal that the Persian Government should be required to make a declaration with regard to the employment of foreigners might be held to engage His Majesty’s Government. I have accordingly begged him to postpone presenting such a demand until I have ascertained your views on the subject and communicated them to him. No. 166. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received November 24.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, November 24, 1911. CONVEYS substance of the following extract from a despatch dated the 29th November :— ON receiving your telegram of the 23rd instant I again pressed M. Neratof to stop the further advance of the troops, giving him to understand that you had been greatly disappointed to hear that the troops were not to be withdrawn immediately on the Russian Government complying with the Persian demands. I further expressed the hope that the Imperial Government would do nothing to add to the difficulties with which you would be confronted when foreign affairs came up for discussion in the House of Commons next Monday. M. Neratof said that he was insisting in the Council of Ministers that for the present at any rate the troops should be retained at Resht; but that he could not give me an assurance that they would not advance beyond it, as were he to do so, the Persian Government would never yield. As regarded the question of the resumption of diplomatic relations, M. Poklewski would be instructed to warn the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, when he announced his intention of paying a visit of apology, that further demands were about to be presented, and that if, in spite of this warning, the apologies were presented, his Excellency supposed that diplomatic relations would be resumed. M. Neratof then said that as the meeting of the Council of Ministers had been postponed for twenty-four hours he could not give me an authoritative statement with regard to the new demands, of which he had spoken to me yesterday. They would, however, he thought, deal with the question of Mr. Shuster’s dismissal, the employment of foreigners in important posts in the Persian administration, and the settlement of all outstanding litigious matters in a conciliatory spirit. The question of Mr. Lecoffre’s appointment was a matter of secondary importance; but it might be well to take this opportunity ^ of obtaining the recognition of the Anglo-Russian agreement; while a proposal which would be more in the nature of a wish than of a demand would be put forward for the constitution of a Senate. I pressed his Excellency strongly to limit the number of these demands to the strictest minimum, and remarked that I did not know how far you would approve of the mention of our legation in the matter of the employment of foreigners, when the demand about to be presented was virtually an ultimatum that might have to be imposed by force. I added that in my opinion the same objection held good with regard to a demand for the recognition of the Anglo-Russian understanding. His Excellency admitted that this might be awkward for us, and said that he would try to finH a formula that would show that Russia was acting entirely on her own responsibility. In reply to some objections which I had raised, his Excellency gave methe assurance that he would not insist on the immediate settlement of all pending questions; that the troops would not remain in Persia till such a settlement had been effected ; and that the^ Russian Government would be content with a declaration in the sense that those questions would be settled in a conciliatory spirit. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. No. 167. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 24, 1911. SEE your telegram of yesterday. His Majesty’s Government consider it impossible for them to object to formulation of Russian demands as proposed. We nevertheless consider it essential that as soon as Persian Government has complied with Russia’s two original demands the movements of Russian troops should be stopped, and that, as regards the new Russian demands, time should be given to allow diplomatic pressure to be brought to bear at Tehran to ensure their acceptance. Of course presentation of further Russian demands at Tehran must take place before His Majesty’s Government can do anything there. I take it for granted that M. Poklewski will be instructed to resume diplomatic relations as soon as Persian Government has agreed to the two original demands of his Government, and when that has been done, concerted action between His Majesty’s representative and M. Poklewski will be possible. No. 168. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 24, 1911. EMPLOYMENT of foreigners in Persia I see no objection to our supporting Russian demand (see your telegram of to-day), which does not seem to differ much from what has hitherto been the practice. 1 consider, however, in the first instance, that Russain Government should act on their own responsibility in putting forward demands. No. 169. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey .— (Received November 26.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, November 26, 1911. 1 RECEIVED a visit yesterday from the Persian charge d’affaires, who asked me what was the nature of the further demands which the Russian Government proposed to present. He added that after the communication which Sir G. Barclay had made to his Government, the latter had hoped that when they had complied with the two original Russian demands the troops would be withdrawn. To this I replied that the order for withdrawal would have been given if the Persian Government had at once given the satisfaction demanded and had not waited till the troops had landed on Persian soil. I informed him that the council of Ministers was to meet this evening and would then formulate the further demands, and I said that Mr. Shuster’s action in publishing his pamphlet had greatly incensed the Russian Government. He asked whether Russia would demand the dismissal of Mr. Shuster, and I said that I thought such a demand was most probable, adding that, in my opinion, it was of far greater moment to Persia to re-establish good relations with Russia than to keep Mr. Shuster in her service, and that the responsibility for the estrangement between the two countries lay chiefly at his door.T6 (Translation.) THE present conflict between Russia and Persia, the immediate cause of which was the incident which arose during the confiscation of Prince Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s properties, should be regarded as the continuation of a series of events which have justly aroused Russia’s displeasure, and which were caused principally by the irreconcilable attitude of the Persian Radical party towards Russia, as also by Mr. Morgan Shuster’s arbitrary proceedings. Mr. Shuster has always, ever since his arrival in Persia, refused to take into consideration Russia’s legitimate claims in respect of the numerous interests she has in that country. Mr. Shuster’s attempt to interfere in matters which lay within the competence of the Belgian administrators of the Persian customs, in violation of the contract between the Russian Bank and the Persian Government, his obstinate refusal to give up the idea of employing Mr. Stokes in the administration of the Treasury gendarmerie, the appointment of Mr. Lecoffre, &amp;c., are sufficient proof of the hostile attitude taken up by this foreigner towards Russia. But the final incident, when the orders given by Mr. Shuster to his gendarmes were of an evidently provocative character towards the Russian consulate-general, exhausted the patience of the Russian Government, who justly considered themselves outraged by these proceedings, and found themselves forced, first of all to demand reparation, and then, when this was not made to them, to have recourse to strong measures. Again, quite lately, Mr. Shuster has committed an act inadmissible on the part of an official in the service of the State by publishing in the “Times” his letter containing arbitrary charges against Russia and England, and, above all, by distributing in Persia a Persian translation of this letter with fresh details, with the manifest intention of stirring up the Persians against Russia. The object which the Russian Government have in view is to establish normal and stable relations with the Persian Government, and to remove the elements of discord which are harmful to the development of friendly intercourse between the two countries. It is for this purpose that Russia intends to formulate certain fresh demands. In the action which they are now taking in Persia the Russian Government are only pursuing the defence of their legitimate interests in that country, in the sphere reserved to them by the convention of 1907 ; their proceedings are in no way in contradiction to the provisions of that convention, since they are not pursuing any object which could assail the integrity or independence of Persia. Further, they desire to state categorically that the military measures which they are taking in Persian territory are only of a purely provisional character, and that they in no wise intend to infringe the principles governing the agreement between Russia and England concerning Persia. Suimnary of the Reasons which 'provoked Russia s first demands. Leaving on one side the question of the confiscation of Prince Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s properties, against which the Russian representatives at Tehran have never protested in principle, it should be observed that the Imperial Government’s displeasure was provoked firstly by the manner in which this measure was carried out by the Persian Treasury gendarmerie, who were acting in conformity to the orders of their chief, Mr. Morgan Shuster, the financial adviser, and next by the action of the Persian Government in approving the conduct of their employes and throwing the responsibility on the Russian officials. It is clear that the Imperial Government can alone judge of the proceedings of their agents on the spot, and after a close examination the Imperial Government have arrived at the conclusion that these proceedings were in conformity with the rights of the Russian Government and with the local usage. On the other hand, the Cabinet of St. Petersburg!! have convinced themselves that the attitude of the financial adviser and of his agents in the incident under discussion was clearly hostile and offensive towards the Russian officials. In this connection special stress may be laid on the following facts :— 1. The inoccupation by 7 force of the Prince’s house, carried out before the end of the conversations between the Russian consul-general and Mr. Shuster’s agents. 2. The dispatch of a force of more than 100 gendarmes with this object, as though Mr. Shuster foresaw the possibility of a collision between this force and the consul- generals escort. 3. The culminating point of the incident—the fact that the Persian gendarmesventured to aim tlieir rifles at the employes of the consulate-general with the manifest intention of firing on them. 4. The dispatch by the Persian Government, contrary to all tradition, of two consecutive notes demanding the recall of the Russian consul-general and of one of his subordinates, in spite of M. Poklewsky’s verbal reply to the first note to the effect that he considered this demand as non-avenu. 5. This incident should be considered in connection with Mr. Morgan Shuster s previous proceedings, which had often before roused the displeasure of the Russian Government. d- The unfavourable effect produced even at Tehran on the prestige of the Russian authorities in consequence of the insulting behaviour of the Persian authorities, an effect which is felt by the Russian colony at Tehran. Reasons for which the Russian Government find it necessary to make new demands of the Persian Government. 1. The Persian Government failed to give within a reasonable term a reply to the note containing the first demands, a fact which forced the Russian Government to send troops into Persia. 2. The explanation given that a reply to this note could not be sent owing to the non-existence of a Cabinet cannot be accepted, considering that the former Ministry had only resigned a few days after the presentation of the note and that their very resignation showed us their intention of avoiding the necessity of satisfying the Russian demands. 3. The Principal Point. —The letter addressed by Mr. Morgan Shuster to the “ Times,” containing false assertions and arbitrary accusations against Russia, and, above all, the distribution by him to the native population of a Persian translation of that letter with new details added, the manifest object of this being to stir up the Persian people against Russia. 4. The Russian Government, desiring to establish normal and stable relations with the Persian Government, consider it necessary to obtain from the latter real guarantees for the removal of the elements of discord which are harmful to the development of friendly intercourse between the two countries. No. 171. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received November 26.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, November 26, 1911. MY preceding telegram of to-day, I have just received a private letter from M. Neratof, informing me that it was decided at a meeting of the Council of Ministers held yesterday that the following demands should be presented at Tehran ;— 1. Both Mr. Shuster and Mr. Lecoffre to be dismissed, and the engagement to be given by the Persian Government in accordance with demand No. 2 to apply to all Other foreign officials already appointed by Mr. Shuster. 2. The Persian Government must give an engagement that they will obtain the consent of the Russian and British Legations before offering any post in the Persian service to persons of foreign nationality. 3. Expenses incurred by the present military expedition to be reimbursed by the Persian Government. The demands will be presented at Tehran on the 28th instant in the form of an ultimatum, granting a delay of only forty-eight hours for their acceptance. During that delay the Russian troops will not be moved beyond Resht. On the previous occasion when troops were sent to Kazvin in 1909, M. Iswolsky took up the position that it was impossible for Russia to keep sending troops backwards and forwards to Persia and so rendering herself ridiculous, and the same feeling is strongly held here on the present occasion.78 No. 172.

His Excellency replied that the Council of Ministers had decided that, in order to satisfy public opinion in Russia, it was necessary that this second ultimatum should be couched in much sharper language than the first. The ultimatum, moreover, was not to be presented till the 28th instant, and, as the Persian Government must have been aware from the language held to the Minister for Foreign Affairs by M. Poklewski on the 24th instant, that Mr. Shuster’s dismissal would be insisted on, they would have had sufficient time for reflection. The new 7 demands were, his Excellency contended, most moderate, and had been purposely restricted to matters connected with the incident that had provoked the presentation of an ultimatum. In reply to an enquiry which I had addressed to him respecting the second half of the first demand, his Excellency explained that it was intended more especially to apply to the ten new T Americans, whose appointment had already been sanctioned by the Medjliss, but that it would be left to M. Poklewski to decide whether any action should be taken with regard to any other foreigners holding appointments in the Persian service. He also said that, should the Russian demands not have been accepted before the troops reached Kazvin, be thought that they would probably make a few days’ halt in that town before advancing on Tehran. I expressed the hope that, even should they have to occupy the capital, the Russiandemands would not be further increased, and his Excellency gave me to understand that in that case all that would he asked for would he a larger indemnity.

He expressed the strong hope that His Majesty’s Government would inform the Russian Government, and obtain the recall of the Russian forces, 250 of whom had landed on the 21st instant at Enzeli. He said that he felt that his personal position was at stake, as he had led the Persian Government to believe, after his interview with me, that all would end well if they apologised. Mr. Mallet reminded him that I had made no engagements, and indeed could not have done so, and he agreed to this, hut pointed out that he had told me that if the demands were complied with and nevertheless the troops advanced, his Government would he placed in a most serious position. He hoped, therefore, that I should act as mediator. I had said that I could not do that, but had advised that the demands should he complied with immediately, as this would facilitate negotiations. The Persian Minister asked whether the Russian Government had replied to my telegram of 20th November, and Mr. Mallet replied that we had as yet not had any final answer. The Persian Minister urged that we should make a further representation and appeal to the Russian Government. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. No. 177. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G.

Mr. Mallet replied in the negative, and said that His Majesty’s Government had no definite information yet as to what the Russian Government would do.

Sir A. Nicolson remarked to him that, as I had told him, it was difficult for His Majesty’s Government to intervene between Pussia and Persia.

Persian Minister here has asked our advice, and requested that British Minister at Tehran should be instructed to confer with Minister for Foreign Affairs. I am ready to use what influence I can to induce Persian Government to comply with Russian demands, if they are as stated in your telegram of 26th November, but it is essential that more time should be given. I have in reply to criticism here of Russian action as being harsh and unfair to Persia stated the Russian case, but there is a strong and natural feeling that failure to prevent return of ex-Shah and inherent weakness of Persian Government afford a valid plea for some consideration. His Majesty’s Government had hoped that the Russian troops would have been withdrawn when once the two demands, as originally formulated, had been complied with; and they would therefore be much disappointed were those troops now to advance to Tehran, or, indeed, beyond Resht. They, moreover, fail to see that the situation is of sufficient urgency to justify the presentation of an ultimatum with so short a time limit. You should urge strongly that Russian demands should be put forward without time limit simply as condition of withdrawal of troops; that Russia should then, if there is delay in complying, come to an agreement with us as to what changes are required at Tehran to secure her interests. My public statements here have shown how clearly we feel that those interests must not be prejudiced.

I explained that the dispute between Russia and Persia did not concern us directly; but that the consequences of the Russian action might be very serious. I said that, whether the things in Mr. Shuster’s pamphlet were right or wrong, the situation certainly became intolerable when the official of one Government distributed attacks upon another Government; but this would hardly justify a precipitate occupation of Tehran. I then used all the arguments contained in my telegram to you of to-day.

IN our interview of Friday last (the 24th November) I had the honour to draw your attention to the reasons for which the Imperial Government would have to make some further demands, and in this connection 1 was awaiting further instructions from my Government, which I have now received. I now have the honour to make the following demands on behalf of the Imperial Government:— Firstly, the dismissal of Mr. Shuster and Mr. Lecoffre ; and the status of other persons invited by Mr. Shuster to serve the Persian Government will come under the second item of these demands. Secondly, an undertaking on the part of the Persian Government not to invite any foreigners to join their service without the previous consent of the British and Russian Legations. Thirdly, payment by the Persian Government of the expenses of the present Russian military expedition to Persia; the sum payable to the Imperial Government and the manner of its payment will be fixed after the receipt of the Persian Government’s reply. I consider it my duty to explain that the reason for these measures is firstly the absolute necessity of obtaining compensation for the movement of troops which the Imperial Government has been forced to send to Persia, and for Mr. Shuster’s recent offensive actions towards Russia, and furthermore the sincere desire of Russia now to remove the principal source of the differences which have arisen, and for the future to lay the foundations upon which the two Governments can build up friendly and stable relations, and to give a prompt and satisfactory solution to all Russian matters and pending questions. [503] &amp;82 Furthermore, it is necessary for me to warn you that the Imperial Government cannot wait more than forty-eight hours for the fulfilment of these conditions, during which time the Russian troops will remain at Resht; but if, before the expiration of this term, no answer is received or if the answer is unsatisfactory, the troops will advance, and this will of course increase the sum payable by the Persian Government to the Russian Government.

Ultimatum contains no promise to withdraw troops on compliance with demands. Minister for Foreign Affairs has sent his “ chef de cabinet ” again to appeal to our good offices to obtain some mitigation of demands, or at any rate an extension of the period of grace. Demands came to Persian Government as a complete surprise, and term allowed gives them no time to deliberate. He asked me for advice. I replied that I had no instructions, but that I personally thought that the Persian Government had better yield without delay. No. 184. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 29, 1911. PERSIAN Minister has again asked advice, and I have told him that I can say nothing definite till I know exactly how Russian demands are formulated and can say for certain that compliance will secure withdrawal of Russian troops. I have, however, told him definitely that Shuster makes things impossible. It is obvious that Persia cannot pay an indemnity, and I assume Russian troops will not remain till actual payment has been made if everything else is settled. To exact indemnity before Persia has obtained a loan would be fatal to any prospect of improvement of southern roads, and would thereby further intensify damage to British trade. \ It is important that I should know text of Russian demands, and whether it can be said definitely that compliance will secure withdrawal of troops. Persian Minister represents to me that he desires advice as to how new Persian Cabinet must act generally to secure friendly relations with Russia, and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs may be able to say something on this point also. Impression made on me by Persian Minister is that Persian Government realise how serious situation is. No. 185. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 29.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, November 29, 1911. CONVEYS substance of the following despatch, dated the 30th November :— Sir, I have the honour to report that I called yesterday afternoon on* the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. His Excellency greeted me by expressing the great satisfaction which your speech in the House of Commons had caused him, adding that he had instructed Count Benckendorff to convey to you his thanks and acknowledgments. I replied that I had been charged by you to deliver a message of a rather different character, as you had learnt with much regret that a second ultimatum had been presented to the Persian Government that required an answer within forty- eight hours. I repeated to him what I had said in previous conversations with regard to the shortness of the time limit, and urged on his Excellency the importance'•BamwmamammmmmBmMHMBl, 83 ol allowing you sufficient time to use your influence with the Persian Governmen m order to arrive at a peaceful settlement of this incident. An occupation of Tehra y. ussian troops wpuldj I said, tend to estrange English public opinion. In order moreover, that he might realise how strongly you felt on the subject I read to him m b rench translation, your telegrams of the 28th and 29th instant. M. Nffiatof, in the course of a long conversation, once more explained the reasons wnich had forced the liussian Government to give a more peremptory character to this second ultimatum, flhe ultimatum had, he believed, been presented that morning, but, as he had not yet received confirmation of this from M. Poklewski, he could not give me its actual text. Ihe three points, however, recorded in my telegram of the 26th instant exactly reproduced the instructions sent to Tehran, though a few words had been added to the effect that the amount of the indemnity and the mode of its payment would be settled when the three demands had been complied with and the actual cost of the expedition established. The Russian Government would not press for an immediate payment, nor would they, he believed, increase their demands. He declined to accede to my request to do away with the time limit altogether, or even to extend it, and could not give me an assurance that the troops should make a halt of a week or ten days at Kazvin. On my urging that such an extension might be granted, were the Persian Government to inform M. Poklewski of their readiness to take the three demands into consideration if only the Russian Government would allow them more time for their examination, M. Neratof declared that this was impossible. Eventually, however, he said that, if the Persian Government would give a definite assurance in writing that they w^ould comply with the three demands, he would allow thern another fifteen days to arrange the various details connected with Mr. Shuster’s dismissal, such as the question of the indemnity to be paid him, &amp;c. Pie also promised to wait till Saturday before sending telegraphic instructions for an advance of the troops from Resht to Kazvin. His Excellency, at my request, then telephoned to the President of the Council, who replied that he would receive me at once. _ I repeated to M. Kokovtsoff what I had said to M. Neratof, using almost precisely similar language, and urging him, in the interest of the Anglo-Russian understanding, to meet your wishes in a more generous spirit, as I considered that the assurances which I had received from M. Neratof did not go nearly far enough. His Excellency said that His Majesty’s Government could naturally take a calmer view of the incidents which had recently occurred in Persia, as they had not been directly touched by them. This was not the case with Russia, whose dignity had been •offended. The only way to make the Persians understand that Russia would not be trifled with was to present an ultimatum, requiring an immediate answer and holding out no hope of a possible compromise. The Russian Government had gained nothing by adopting a less drastic form in presenting their tw'o original demands, but had had to wait for an answer till their troops had arrived at Resht. On my remarking that the satisfaction which they had now received with regard to the first incident ought to make them adopt a more lenient attitude as regarded the second, M. Kokovtsoff said that, at the Council of Ministers at which the second ultimatum had been drafted, the demands to be presented had been reduced to a minimum. He could assure me that Russia had no desire to occupy Tehran, and, if you could induce the Persian Govern ment to yield, and thus save her the necessity of ordering the troops to advance, he would be most grateful. He understood from all that I had told him that it was not the demands themselves to which you took exception, but the form in which they had been presented, and the manner in which they were to be imposed on the Persian Government. It might give rise to a possible misunderstanding were he to give me any definite assurances with regard to the various points touched on in your telegrams without first consulting his colleagues, and he would, therefore, ask me to send him copies of those telegrams. He would then submit them to a Council of Ministers to be held on the following afternoon, and let me know their decision through M. Neratof. In the course of our conversation, M. Kokovtsoff said that as regarded the indemnity, public opinion in Russia demanded that, if Persia wantonly provoked military intervention, she should pay for the cost of the expedition. He would be satisfied with a definite assurance from the Persian Government that the indemnity would be paid, and would not be too hard on them with regard to the term in which payment must be made. Though his Excellency received my remarks with regard to an extension of the time limit and a halt of a week or ten days at Kazvin in a conciliatory spirit, he declined to pledge himself in any way. I have this morning forwarded to M. Kokovtsoff copies in French of your two [503] * G 284 telegrams above referred to, and have, in the covering private letter, expressed the hope that he will use his powerful influence to induce the Council of Ministers to decide this question in a manner conformable to your wishes.

He said that he had received assurances from the Russian Minister; in view of these he appeared no longer anxious on that point. He laid, however, great stress on the fact that it was impossible to comply with the demands in the time allowed. The opinion in the Medjliss was strongly against compliance, and it w r as a physical impossibility for him to win over by to-morrow a majority to his way of thinking. He added that he had always been most sincerely anxious to smooth relations with Russia. He hopes that the Russian Government will not utilise this delay as a pretext for putting forward other demands than those already presented.Sir G.

His Excellency then proceeded to inform me that the Medjliss had categorically refused to comply with Russia’s demands. He had hardly expected that they would accept them straight away, but he had hoped that they would have contented themselves with leaving them without an answer, instead o s rutting the door on all further conversation. The order for an advance from Eesht would not, as he had promised me, be dispatched till the following afternoon, and a halt of a few days^ would be made at Kazvin. There was, however, now no piospect of a compliance on the part of the Persian Government unless t le Medjliss could be sent about their business. He was not, however, sure whether the constitution conferred on the Regent the power to dissolve them. In the conversation which ensued I once more endeavoured to impress on his Excellency that the occupation of Tehran would inevitably cause serious complications and give use to fresh incidents, which would in their turn occasion the presentation of liesh demands. The Russians would on their arrival there find no regular Government’Uli 87 with which to treat, while the ex-Shah would probably try to profit by the confusion to re-establish himself on the throne. To this, as I had once before told his Excellency, His Majesty s Government would under no circumstances consent. His Excellency assured me that the Imperial Government would give the ex-Shah no support whatsoever. ^ I subsequently reminded him of the difficult position in which His Majesty’s Government would be placed were Russia to press matters too far, and begged him to take that position into account. M. Neratof replied that Russia’s prestige must be upheld.

After perusing the several documents, M. Neratof said that you were at liberty to use them. He pointed out, however, that the instructions to M. Poklewski whicn formed the subject of M. Klemm’s letter had ceased to have any practical interest now that the Pussian demands had been rejected, and that as regarded the halt of the troops at Kazvin, which was referred to in the letter which he had written to me, he could tell me that the commander of the troops had been ordered not to advance beyond that town without further instructions from St. Petersburgh or from the Pussian Legation at Tehran. He could not, however, guarantee that the troops would stop at Kazvin, as should disorders break out at Tehran it might be necessary to order them to proceed at once to the capital for the protection of the legation. I then enquired if he could not give me some more precise assurances with regard to the eventual demands w 7 hich Pussia might possibly put forward, and after some further conversation he approved the following statement, which I wrote down and showed to him “ Should circumstances arise to rend&lt; r necessary the presentation of further demands, those demands will not go beyond questions having a particular interest for Pussia, such as the settlement of outstanding matters in dispute or other matters having an exclusive interest for Pussia in the zone that has been reserved to her, and will not touch questions of a general political interest.” I have, &amp;c.

Foreign Office, December 2, 1911. THE language you held about the ex-Shah (see your telegram of the 1st December) has my approval. I am glad to note that the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs agreed to it. I feel strongly that Tehran should not be occupied by the Russians except in the last resort, and that new and more extensive demands should not be put forward by them. This is very important, and I hope that if they lind it necessary to formulate fresh demands they will first consult His Majesty’s Government. The danger which I anticipate is that they may make new demands which, being neither inevitable nor consistent with the Anglo-Russian Agreement, I should be unable to defend. No. 212. Sir Edivard Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. Sir, Foreign Office, December 2, 1911. I SPOKE very seriously to Count Benckendorff to-day as to my anxiety about Persia. I said it was unfortunate, in the first instance, that the Russian ultimatum had been based upon the question of the property of the Shoa-es-Sultaneh: for the question was of comparatively slight importance, and the Russian case with regard to it did not seem to be very strong. I also regretted that the Russian troops had not been withdrawn when the Persian Government complied with the two demands in connection with the property. It was true that there had been a delay of a few days in complying with the demands, but nevertheless the circumstances in which the Russian action was taken were not fortunate. Three demands had now been put forward. With regard to the first two, as to Mr. Shuster and the future appointment of foreign advisers, I could not object. Mr. Shuster had rejected the advice which we had given him through our Minister in Tehran ; he had placed us in a most embarrassing position ; and some arrangement with the Persian Government respecting foreign advisers was necessary even from the British point of view, to prevent our being placed in such a position again. It would have been better^ I thought, if the Persian Government had been asked to promise not to appoint foreign advisers without consultation with the Russian and British Legations instead of being bound to obtain consent; but this was rather a matter of form. 1.regretted that an indemnity had been asked for. British trade had suffered much more than Russian trade : in fact, Russian trade in the north might even have gained by the stoppage of British trade in the south. Money was essential for the restoration of order in the south, and the Russian demand for an indemnity would be felt here as injurious to the prospect of the restoration of order in the south that was necessary for British trade. As the demand had been put forward, the Persian Govern ment must say “ Yes” to it; hut'I trusted that payment would either not be pressed for, or in some way be commuted for some other advantage later on. I then urged strongly upon the Ambassador that the Russian troops should not go to lehran, except in the very last resort; and that no further demands of a more far-reaching nature should be put forward by the Russian Government without consultation with us. If the Russian Government would restrict themselves to their existing demands, and would not go to Tehran except in the last resort, I thought that we might get through the present difficulties. We might secure a Persian' 2,111 e Past | :f UlL of teli for Foieigi ^ptii| ; fomilln to foiii ^gerflj mkhi id, erUH met? skit .timatmljf mem 91 Government who would realise that they must govern with a good disposition towards Kussian interests, instead of in opposition to them. We should be able to assist such a Government with foreign advisers, and facilitate a loan on favourable terms. Things in Persia might then become better than they had yet been. But, at present, we were passing through a very delicate and difficult time; and I was afraid that the Government in St. Petersburgh did not realise what great issues were at stake, and what great care was needed to prevent our drifting apart.

Vosuk-ed-Dowleh to M. Poklewski. (Translation.) Your Excellency, Tehran, December 2, 1911. IN answer to your Excellency’s note No. 158 of the 29tli November, I have the honour to say that, after the Imperial (Russian) Government had made certain demands of my Government through your Excellency’s note No. 156 respecting the seizure of Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s property, and though the Persian Government had already made known to your Excellency, through verbal messages, the true state of the case and their views respecting the matter, and though there had been a Cabinet crisis for some time before the receipt of the above-mentioned note, the Persian Government took the prompt and immediate measures compatible with the necessary fiiendly relations and the maintenance of good-will on the part of this Government in older to fulfil the demands of the Imperial Government. ... • i i This peaceful intention and accommodating spirit on our part was considered to be the means of removing any kind of irritation or annoyance felt by the Russian Government, and it was on this account that we acted as we did. But, as against this accommodating spirit, the Russian Government, in their note No. 156, did not stipulate any specified time for the fulfilment of their demands, while they were aware of the Cabinet crisis. Although in the above-mentioned note and in verbal messages no notice was given as to the dispatch of trcops in the event of the conditions referred to above being rejected, suddenly it was announced that relations were severed and that troops were being dispatched ; and, after the fulfilment of the conditions, orders were not sent for the return of the troops whose dispatch w r as known to you to be connected with the non-fulfilment of the demands. Unfortunately, the Russian Government did not limit themselves even to this, and the ancient friendly relations, which have always been apparent and reflected in the notes of your legation, have not been observed and maintained. Now, in your note No. 158 you put forward other demands to the Persian Government. The extraordinary importance of these demands is obvious; some of them are clearly contrary to the independence of the State, while the time (allowed) is so little that it is physically impossible to give them the necessary consideration and examination, and the door is closed to discussion. What is more astonishing is that your note explains these demands, firstly, by attributing them to the absolute necessity of obtaining compensation, then to the insulting actions of Mr. Shuster, and, finally, to the sincere desire of the Russian Government to remove causes of difference and to establish the basis of an under standing and good relations; whereas in the matter of the dispatch of Russian troops the Persian Government were in no way involved. There can be no cause of complaint until the real necessity for compensation is shown and until the Persian Government have refused to give satisfaction with respect to the insult referred to, wdiich has not been discussed by the two Governments as to whether it actually occurred, or in what circumstances, and before a preliminary enquiry has been held. The removal of differences, together with the establishment of the basis of an understanding and unity, are naturally more compatible with peaceful methods. After the above preamble, while inviting your Excellency and the Imperial Government to consider the true state of the case and the good relations existing between the two Governments and the importance of maintaining them, I beg that the Persian Government may be excused from fulfilling the demands. I have, however, the honour to inform your Excellency of the Persian Government’s readiness to discuss alterations in the above-mentioned proposals, and to accept any just proposals wliicli may be made to the Persian Government. I avail, &amp;c. VOSUK-ED-DOWLEH. Enclosure 2 in No. 216. Proceedings of the Medjliss on December 1, 1911. THE following Cabinet Ministers were present at the debate Mushir-ed - Dowleh (Education). Moazed-es-Sultaneh (Posts and Telegraphs). Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh (Justice). Vosuk-ed-Dowleh (Foreign Affairs).mmammmnamtmaKKMt 93 The Foreign Minister made the following speech :— 1 ‘ On Wednesday last, at noon, a note was sent to the Foreign Office by the Russian Legation, as the deputies are aware, and I now' read it for the information of the public.” After reading the note containing Russia’s three demands and giving forty-eight hours for their fulfilment, Vosuk-ed-Dowleh said “ The Foreign Office having reason to expect that some such demands would be made, serious steps were taken before and after the receipt of the note, but unfortunately with no result. As part of the note is vaguely worded, and we believed that other demands might follow' the three contained in this note, explanations w-ere requested, and we are now convinced that no other demands will follow. The Cabinet therefore unanimously recommends the acceptance of these demands. 1 may add that Ave also wrote to the British Legation asking for the mediation of Great Britain, and the legation has recommended that the demands should be accepted wdthout delay. Noav, of course, we Avill do as the Medjliss may decide.” Several speeches folloAved, and though their tone was moderate, the acceptance of the demands was firmly deprecated as incompatible Avith the independence of the country. Matin-es-Sultaneh, acting in pursuance of a plan prearranged with the Cabinet, said he proposed that the Government should be authorised to comply with the first and third demands, but that the second demand should be rejected as incompatible with the independence of the country. This motion Avas, however, only supported by six votes. Haji Ez-u 1-Mamalek, after opposing the acceptance of the demands, made the following motion, which, it is understood, had been prepared beforehand:— “ After having heard the statement made by the GoA r ernment, the National Assembly considers that the demands of the Russian Government are incompatible with the independence of the country, and we cannot therefore comply with them. The Government is requested to enter into communications with a vieAv to their modification, and the discussions in the Medjliss on the subject are brought to a close.” The motion was carried practically unanimously, only six members voting against it.

Sir G, Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 4.) Sir, Tehran. November 20, 1911. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a report, compiled by Mr. Churchill, of the debate held in the Medjliss on the 13th instant, at which the Medjliss voted a prolongation of its session by forty-six votes to six. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 220. Report by Mr. Churchill respecting Debate in the Medjliss, November 13, 1911. I ATTENDED at the first part of the sitting and heard the arguments for and against the proposal to prolong the session until just over half the deputies of the new Medjliss arrive in Tehran. It was quite clear from the outset that the general feeling of the House was strongly in favour of prolonging the session, but nevertheless several members (notably Haji Imam Jumah, of Khoi), though admitting the desirability of the prolongation, pointed out the illegality of such a measure. Against the proposal it was urged that the Medjliss could not legally pass an Act contrary to the constitution without a referendum, and in support of this contention the case of the Electoral Law of July, 1909 was cited. On that occasion it was found necessary to modify four articles of the constitution of December 1906 (namely articles 4, 5, 6, and 49), and for this purpose the matter was referred to the provincial Anjumans, which eventually empowered the committee charged with the framing of the Electoral Law to modify those articles of the constitution. Telegrams having been received from certain provinces urging the Medjliss to continue its sittings, and these telegrams having been quoted as justification for the contem plated measure, those opposing it pointed out that they did not in themselves constitute a referendum, or show that the constituencies were really in favour of the prolongation. It was further stated that the course now contemplated had scarcely ever had a precedent in European countries, and Matin-es-Sultaneh, after referring to the precedent of the Long Parliament in England, and its ultimate dissolution by Cromwell, quoted the words of a great British statesman to the effect that nothing could be more disgraceful than that a Parliament should prolong its own life. These arguments however, had very little effect, and those supporting the proposed measure, dwelt on the danger with which the country is at this moment confronted, and the paramount necessity for the representatives of the people to supervise the Government at this critical juncture. It was pointed out that if all the provinces had not expressed their wishes, it was because some of them were prevented from doing so by reactionary forces, and that if the Medjliss were to dissolve and wait for fresh elections, the enemies of the constitution would find means to prevent elections from taking place, and thereby to put off the reassembling of Parliament indefinitely. Eventually the committee’s report was put to the vote and agreed to by forty-six votes to six. The law, as passed, was briefly as follows :— That the Medjliss shall continue to sit until one more than half of the members of the new Medjliss shall have arrived in Tehran, and that the Government shall take measures to bring about elections as soon as possible.&amp;iv G. bar day to Sir hJdward Grey .—(lieceived December 4.)

Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 5.) Tehran, Deceinbe't o, 1911. REFERENCE to my telegram of the 3rd December. I saw Minister for Foreign Affairs last night. His Excellency informed me that he had done everything possible to induce the Medjliss to consider the Russian demands. He went on to say that after the vote of the Medjliss, rejecting these demands, the Cabinet had resigned, but owing to the representations of the Regent and the entreaty of the Medjliss, it had been persuaded to continue in office. His Excellency was now anxious to enter into negotiations with Russia on lines that would not conflict so directly with Persian independence as did the demands that Russian Government were now putting forward. Even were the Medjliss to be induced to accept the present demands, a lasting feeling of rancour would be aroused m the country, which would produce a result contrary to the object desired by Russia and expressed in the ultimatum of laying the foundations of friendly and stable relations between the two countries. _ His Excellency enquired whether I thought there was any possibility of Russian Minister advising his Government to soften the demands in some manner. In reply told Minister for Foreign Affairs that I could give him no hope of his doing so, but promised to communicate what he had said to M. Poklewski, whom I was to see tha evening. ^ f I have now, after consultation with my Russian colleague, informed Minister or Foreign Affairs that I fear it would be useless for him to attempt to persua e M.

Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 5.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, December 5, 1911. CONVEYS substance of the following extract from a despatch dated the 9th December:— On the receipt of your telegram of the 2nd instant I addressed a private letter to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, expressing the hope that he would not present any more far-reaching demands to the Persian Government without first consulting you ; and in a conversation which I had with him on the 5th instant I reverted to the subject. M. N eratof said that he had not replied to my letter at once, as he wished to ask me whether some misunderstanding had by any chance arisen, for he could not otherwise understand why you should, after all the assurances which he had given me, take so serious a view of the situation. I replied that we placed entire confidence in his Excellency’s good faith and in all that he had told me with regard to the intentions of the Imperial Government ; but circumstances might arise which might so alter the situation that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Imperial Government to give effect to their assurances. This was the reason why you were urging that the occupation of Tehran should only take place in the very last resort. The march of Russian troops on the capital would be sure to give rise to regrettable incidents, while it was more than likely that there would be a series of assassinations at Tehran itself. We might then be told that the Imperial Government had found it necessary, in consequence of some fresh provocation, to demand satisfaction of a more exemplary character. Then there was the further danger that what was now intended to be a mere temporary occupation might, by the force of circumstances, be converted into an indefinite one. His Excellency replied that there were only two grounds on which an advance to Tehran would be ordered, namely, if no satisfaction had been received before the troops had left Kazvin, or if M. Poklewski should consider their presence necessary for the protection of the lives of foreigners. The main body of the troops would not reach [503] H98 Razvin for eight days, as it would be necessary to provide for the maintenance of communications with Enzeli, and they would probably have to rest there two or three days. We had thus got nearly a fortnight before they would reach Tehran, always supposing that M. Poklewski did not ask for a detachment of Cossacks to be dispatched at all speed for his protection. It seemed from the reports which had reached him that a small body of men, with a couple of guns, was being organised at Tehran to oppose the advance of the Russian troops. This was unfortunate, as, though the resistance which it might offer would be of no account, it was very desirable to avoid a regular conflict on account of the complications to which it might lead. The conduct of the military operations would naturally, his Excellency added, be in the hands of the general in command ; and he would have to decide, if the occasion arose, as to which parts of the town it would be advisable to occupy. On my turning the conversation to the question of the 'possible presentation of further demands, M. Neratof said that he would not put forward any that touched the political future of Persia without first consulting you and obtaining your consent. I then proceeded to speak in the terms of your telegram of the 4th instant, on the subject of the ex-Shah. If, I said, his Excellency would authorise you to state in Parliament that the two Governments had agreed not to recognise His Majesty under any circumstances, such a statement would go far to abate the opposition to Russia’s recent action, and would, at the same time, serve as a pledge for our future co-operation in Persia. M. Neratof told me, in reply, that he had only a few days ago caused a message to be sent to Mohamed Ali, warning him that he must not count on Russia’s support. He did not, however, quite see the object of such a statement as you had proposed at the present moment. It went, moreover, too far, and would have the effect of binding the two Governments never to recognise the ex-Shah should he be recalled to Persia in a few years’ time. I said that the decision which you had taken was an irrevocable one, and that it was essential that publicity should be given to it at the present moment. It was generally believed in Persia, and even in certain quarters in England, that Russian agents were preparing the way for Mohamed Ali’s return, and that Russian troops were about to replace him on the throne. It was necessary, therefore, to undeceive public opinion, and to show that there was no truth in these reports. I reminded M. Neratof that when the ex-Shah landed in Persia last summer, he had declined to join us in notifying to His Majesty that we would not recognise him on the plea that such a procedure would be contrary to the principle on which we had always acted, of never intervening in these internal conflicts. The situation now was entirely different. Mohamed Ali had made his attempt and had failed ; he had undergone defeat after defeat at the hands of the Government troops, and his cause was a hopeless one. If he now succeeded in regaining the throne it would be solely due to the fact that Russian troops were on their way to Tehran, and that, in consequence, the Persian Government was powerless. If we now kept silence, the whole blame for what might happen would be laid at the door of the Russian Government. His Excellency admitted that there was much truth in what I had said, but again contended that if there was a popular movement in his favour in a few years’ time, we might be compelled to recognise him. I observed that when a few months ago there was a question of the ex-Shah again seeking asylum in Russia, his Excellency had himself told me that we might be quite easy as regarded the future, as His Majesty had been so bitterly disappointed with the reception which he had met with in Persia that he would never show his face there again. M. Neratof then put forward several suggestions that he thought would meet the requirements of the case, of which one was that the Russian Government should give an assurance that the ex-Shah should not be recognised so long as the Russian troops remained in occupation, and another that they would not recognise him without the consent of His Majesty’s Government. I pointed out that a declaration to which a time limit was attached would amount to an invitation to His Majesty to return when the time specified had expired, and I finally appealed to him to act as you suggested out of regard for the difficult position in which you were placed, as well as in the interest of the Anglo-Russian understanding. The ex-Shah, I remarked, had never displayed any qualities that rendered him desirable as a ruler, and if only his Excellency would meet your wishes on this point, I was sure that you would co-operate with him to secure the constitution of a Government at Tehran that would be friendly disposed towards Russia. The object which both Governments had in view was the same. They both desired to see a stable regime established in Persia, and they were only at varianceon the question of the means to be employed to accomplish this end. I was, however, firmly convinced that concerted action by our two representatives would be found more effectual than the presentation of demands at the point of the bayonet. M. Neratof replied that he sincerely desired to see the co-operation of the two Governments maintained, adding that he would endeavour to find a formula that would give you satisfaction. I have, &amp;c.

IN a conversation which I had with him on the 6th instant, M. Neratof, while expressing the confident hope that w T e should eventually find a solution that would suit both Governments, still maintained his objection to any statement respecting the return of the ex-Shah that would bind the two Governments irrevocably in the future. In support of his contention he remarked that some of the Bakhtiari were said to be m favour of recalling Mahomed Ali, and asked what would be our position after making such a statement, supposing that they placed him once more on the throne. I replied that you had considered this, as well as other possible eventualities, and that nothing could now alter your fixed determination. The Bakhtiari, I observed, were not so enamoured of the ex*Shah as to insist on restoring him, were they informed beforehand that we would not recognise him. I informed M. Neratof of the language held by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to Sir G. Barclay (see the latter’s telegram of the 5th December). His Excellency observed that in the Russian demands the only point that might wound Persian susceptibilities was the engagement as to foreign advisers required m demand No. 2. Any concession on this point, however, would expose us to the risk oj the Persians appointing another foreigner, who would act precisely as Shuster nactdone, and he did not see how he could make any. The Russian demand, moreover, was only the expression of the principle on which both Powers had always insisted, and which had been observed in practice. With regard to the demand for an indemnity, if the Persian Government would only consent to give the required engagements the Russian Government would be willing to give them any possible facilities. No. 244. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, December 6, 1911. TREASURER-GENERAL. You should discuss with M.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 7.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 7, 1911. MR. SHUSTER’S successor. Please see your telegram of yesterday’s date. My Russian colleague is in favour of Mornard as successor to Shuster. Mornard has been administrator-general of the Persian Customs since Naus’ departure. I have always found him satisfactory, and I think that in view of his long experience of Persia and of the harmonious manner in which he has hitherto worked with the two legations, his appointment would be the most practical in the circumstances. . No. 246. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 7.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 7, 1911. SARDAR ASSAD has been using his influence for moderation, and his return to Persia seems therefore to have relieved the situation. The general feeling appears to be more reasonable. All parties in the Medjliss, including the Democrats, are inclining towards submission, and it is hoped that the Cabinet will be able to persuade the Medjliss to comply with the Russian demands. No. 247. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, December 7, 1911 I THINK it is well that I should now explicitly put on record the views of His Majesty’s Government in regard to certain matters of importance, so that all risk of possible difference between the two Governments may be avoided, and that the lines of future co-operation may be indicated. You should hand M. Neratof a memorandum in the sense of the following paragraphs, and express the hope that the Russian Government will accept it as representing their views also. You should, however, explain that I do not desire to [503] H 3102 increase M. Neratof s difficulties during the present crisis by pressing him as regards details, and I admit that the question of Mr. Shuster’s successor is the only one which can at once be taken in hand :— 1. The solution of the present crisis must be such as to secure a Government in Persia which will conform to the principles of the Anglo-Russian agreement, and not disregard the special interests which the two Powers respectively have in that country. 2. I trust that the Russian Government will not allow any solution which would entail the return of the ex-Shah. Such a restoration could only embarrass an already complicated situation, and is not essential to the object above indicated. It would be inconsistent with our dignity to recognise him now, after his recent disregard of the warnings of both Governments not to return. His restoration would, moreover, give rise to apprehension of vindictive measures on his part against persons who were instrumental in expelling him. 3. As soon as Mr. Shuster goes, it is of the greatest importance that a foreigner, whom both Powers could accept, should be appointed to succeed him. This point should be discussed by the two Ministers, and they should recommend a suitable candidate. 4. When Persian Government have complied with Russian demands they should be placed in a position to restore order in the country. They will require money for this purpose, and the two Governments should therefore assist them to obtain a loan. 5. The Persian Government would be seriously hampered in this connection were the Russian Government to insist on payment of an indemnity. I hope, therefore, that when the crisis is over some way of avoiding this difficulty may be found. 6. It is understood that occupation of Persian territory by Russia and the military measures now in progress are not permanent, but provisional, and that they will cease as soon as Persian Government have carried out Russian demands and have re-established order in Northern Persia. No. 248. /Sir Edward Grey to Sir F. Bertie. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, December 7, 1911. YOU should give to M.

Do they really mean to insist on his giving up this post now ? No. 250. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 8.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 8, 1911. THE Minister for Foreign Affairs paid a visit to the Russian Legation yesterday afternoon and spoke about the Russian demands. Fie said that the second was the one which presented the greatest difficulty, as it attacked Persian independence. Supposing that Persia undertook that she would take into consideration and would not harm the interests of the two Powers when engaging foreigners; his Excellency thought that this form of wording would, in practice, achieve the desired result and would not so clearly attack Persia’s independence. It might also be acceptable to the Medjliss, who might also be induced to accept the other two demands,in jjiuuur.mg’ one. No. 251. biv (jr. Buchanan to Sit Edward (drey.—(Received December 8.) 9th December:— I called again on M ; Neratof yesterday and handed him an aide-memoire embodying the six points laid down in yonr telegram of the preceding day. I explained that you had thought it^ right, in order to prevent any possible misunderstanding, to lecord the lines of policy that would enable the two Governments to continue to woik togethei, and I further expressed the hope that the Russian Government would be able to say that the views held by His Majesty’s Government were in accordance with their own. After promising to give these six points his careful consideration, M. Neratof remarked that, as regarded Mr. Shuster’s successor, it was, in his opinion, essential that no foreign advisers should again be engaged from among the subjects or citizens of any of the Great Powers, and that the attributions of the future financial adviser should be carefully defined, so that it would be impossible for him to usurp dictatorial powers. I subsequently discussed with M. Neratof the proposed parliamentary statement with legard to the ex-Shah, and his Excellency finally accepted the following text as open to no objections, though he added that he must first submit it to M. Sazonow, who was now at Paris :— “ His Majesty’s Government have informed the Russian Government that they would be unable to recognise the ex-Shah were he now to re-establish himself on the throne. The Russian Government have, on their side, assured them that, were the ex-Shah now to attempt to regain the throne, they would equally not recognise him, and that so long as the Russian troops remain in occupation, they will do nothing either to encourage or facilitate His Majesty’s return to the throne.” MY telegram of yesterday. You should supplement memorandum given to Russian Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs by an explanation to the effect that point 6 was intended to mean that as soon as order was re-established all Russian troops, including those at Tabreez and Ardebil, should be withdrawn from Northern Persia. THE Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is now in Paris, called on me this afternoon in order to discuss with me the situation in Persia and to explain to me, for your information, his views on the present situation in that country.

Paris, December 8, 1911. H 4 [503] * Also to Sir F. Bertie, mutatis mutandis.104 I began the conversation by referring to the anxiety which you felt at the situation !. created in Persia by the demands made on the Government of that country by the Russian Government and the presence there of Russian troops._ In case the Russian f Ambassador in London had omitted from his account to bis Excellency of the I , , conversation which he had with you on the 2nd instant any observations of importance which you had made to the Ambassador on that occasion in regard to the question of Persia, I gave to JM. Sazonow for perusal the despatch to Sir George Buchanan m which you recorded the conversation. I afterwards handed to his Excellency a memorandum, of which I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy, giving your views as described in your telegram of yesterday to Sir G. Buchanan. ^ P M. Sazonow said that, so far as he was personally concerned, he concurred in and accepted your views. He could not answer, however, for the acquiescence of the Russian Minister of Finance in your view in regard to the indemnity. He would, however, on reaching St. Petersburgh on the 13th instant do his best to bring about either the dropping of the demand for a money payment or a compromise of some sort f the effect of which would be to mitigate tbe burden of it, and he would discuss the whole question of Persia with His Majesty’s Ambassador after he had examined the j , situation at St. Petersburgh. M. Sazonow then referred to_ the grievances of Russia against the Persian Government. They were many, he said, and had become more accentuated owing, he feared, to what was Russian consideration for Persian weakness, but had been interpreted as Russian weakness by the Persian Government, viz., the premature withdrawal of the Russian troops when on a previous occasion they were marching towards Tehran. The Persian Government had traded on the patience of Russia. ' M. Sazonow said that he fully appreciated the importance of not allowing the Persian question to assume dimensions that might react on the general relations between Russia and England, and you might depend upon his doing his best to bring about a settlement to avoid such a result. He thought there was unnecessary nervousness in England in regard to Russian policy in Persia. The Russian Government had no desire to occupy Tehran unless absolutely necessary to obtain satisfaction, nor to see a restoration of the ex-Shah. His Majesty was entirely discredited in Persia, and he could not be of any service to Russian designs against the integrity of Persia if such designs existed, which they certainly did not. M. Sazonow leaves Paris on the evening of the 10th instant. I have, &amp;c. FRANCIS BERTIE. Enclosure in No. 253. Memorandum communicated to M. Sazonow. THE question of Persia is the source of great anxiety to Sir Edward Grey. He has spoken seriously on the subject to Count Benckendorff, who will no doubt have reported to M. Sazonow the conversation which Sir Edward Grey had with the Ambassador on the 2nd instant. 1 ( Sir Edward Grey desires to put on record now his views on certain points in order to avoid the risk of a possible difference between the Russian and British Governments, i and to indicate the lines on which, in his opinion, they may continue to co-operate; and in doing so he considers it desirable that he should be explicit on certain matters i of importance, viz. :— i 1. He recognises that the outcome of the present situation must be to secure the establishment of a Government in Persia that will conform to the principles of the Anglo-Russian agreement and pay proper regard to the special interests of Great Britain and Russia respectively. ; j 2. It would not be consistent with the dignity of England to recognise a restoration ^ of the ex-Shah after the manner in which he has disregarded the warnings given to him by both the Russian and the British Governments not to return to Persia. His restoration cannot be essential to the object described in point 1. It would, moreover, give rise to apprehension in Persia of vindictive measures on his part against those who ( were instrumental in expelling him from the country. Sir Edward Grey therefore trusts that the Russian Government will not add to the embarrassments of the situation by permitting the restoration of the ex-Shah to be the outcome of the present crisis. 3. The Russian and British Ministers at Tehran should at once confer together as105 5»(| d disi ion tki UlllJti: leral relate i ktteti b Persia, i ty of Peii rd 0® Goveri® ,o co-of rl i 'iiioilil to the selection of a foreign financial adviser to be recommended as successor to M. Shuster, for it is most important that one should be found who would be acceptable to both England and Russia. 4. As soon as the Russian demands on the Persian Government have been conceded, the British and Russian Governments should together consider and co-operate in measures, a loan being one of them, for preventing chaos, and for putting the Persian Government into a position to restore order. 5. The demand for an indemnity, put forward by Russia, would, if exacted, materially impair the object set forth in point 4. Sir E. Grey hopes that when the present crisis is past the Russian Government will find means of avoiding the difficulty which would be caused by an insistence on the payment of an indemnity. 6. Sir E. Grey understands that, as soon as the Russian demands have been complied with and order in Northern Persia has been restored, the military measures and occupation of Persian territory, which are now in progress and are stated to be provisional and not permanent, will cease. Sir Edward has directed Sir Francis Bertie, when communicating his views to M. Sazonow, to state that the only point on which it seems possible to take immediate action is the consideration by the British and Russian representatives at Tehran of the question of a successor to Mr. Shuster, hut Sir E. Grey trusts that M. Sazonow will concur with him that the policy which he has outlined accords with the views of the Russian Government. Paris, December 8, 1911. No. 254. Sir G.

JE m’empresse de vous informer que je ne vois pas d’inconvenient a^ ce que les Ministres de la Russie et de la Grande-Bretagne a Teheran soient invites a s’entendre sur le choix d’un fonctionnaire etranger pour remplacer sans delai Mr. Shuster Morgan, ainsi que vous le proposez an point 3 de Taide-memoire^ que vous m avez^ remis hier. II va sans dire que, selon le principe etabli, le fonctionnaire en question doit etre choisi parmi les sujets des Puissances secondaires. Je telegraphic en ce sens a M. Poklewski, en le priant de me faire connaitre sans delai le resultat de son echange de vues avec Sir George Barclay a ce sujet. II y a cependant un point essentiel sur lequel je dois attirer votre attention cest la necessite de poser prealablement certaines limites a I’activite^ du futur^ conseiller financier, dont le role doit etre strictement reduit a celui ^ d’un ^ conseiller pour 1’Administration des Finances. II s’agit, par consequent, d’obtenir une reduction considerable des droits que le Medjliss avait deferes a Mr. Shuster et a la suite desquels ce dernier jouissait d’un pouvoir presque dictatorial. La situation se trouverait sans doute pen amelioree si le successeur de Air. Shuster pouvait continuer a exercer une influence pareille a celle de son predecesseur. Je demande a M. Poklewski son avis sur la meilleure maniere d’arriver a ce resultat. A. NERATOF. (Translation.) St. Petersburgh, November 26 Aly dear Ambassador, _ _ (December 9), 1911. WITH reference to the proposal contained in point 3 of your aide-memoire of yesterday, I hasten to inform you that I see no reason why the Ministers of Russia and Great Britain at Tehran should not be instructed to consult as to the selection of a foreigner to replace Mr. Shuster without delay. The official in question should of course, in accordance with the established principle, be chosen from among the subjects of one of the minor Powers. I am telegraphing in this sense to Al. Poklewsky, and am requesting him to inform me without delay of the result of his exchange of views with Sir G. Barclay on this subject. There is, however, one essential point to which I must draw your attention, that is the necessity of laying down beforehand certain limits to the functions of the financial adviser, wdiose duties must be strictly confined to those of Adviser to the Financial Administration. This will involve a substantial diminution of the powers conferred by the Medjliss upon Mr. Shuster, in consequence of which he possessed almost dictatorial powers. It is certain that the situation would be very little improved if Air. Shuster’s successor were in a position to exercise the same influence as his predecessor. I am enquiring of M. Poklewsky his opinion as to the best manner of arriving at this result. A. NERATOF. * I No. 256. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 9.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, December 9, 1911. CONVEYS substance of the following extract from a despatch dated the 13th December :— I have the honour to report that, in a conversation which I had with M. Neratof on the 9th instant, I once more tried to bring home to him the gravity of the present situation. The action recently taken by the Imperial Government in Persia had, I said, evoked numerous expressions of disapproval in the House of Commons, and His Majesty s Government were even being taken to task for having tolerated it. I told his Excellency that, according to the latest telegram from Sir G. Barclay, the Persian Governmentseemed now more disposed to comply with the Russian demands. If, however, any hopes that we might entertain of their speedy submission were to be realised, it was absolutely necessary that the Imperial Government should at once give a definite assurance that the Russian troops would be recalled as soon as the Persian Government had accepted the three demands. M. Neratof, in repty, contended that the action to which Russia had had recourse had been forced on her by Persia, and that the demands themselves were most moderate. ^ He could not, at the present moment, take upon himself the responsi bility of giving me such an assurance as I had suggested, as he was in rather a delicate position owing to the fact that M. Sazonow was expected back next Wednesday. He would, however, talk the matter over with the president of the Council. He personally thought that the Imperial Government might give an assurance that the troops would not advance beyond Kazvin before the 21st of this month, and that, if the three demands were complied with by that date, the expedi tionary force would be recalled, provided that, in the meanwhile, no fresh incident occurred, such as an attack on a Russian consulate, &amp;c. As regarded the withdrawal of the troops from Tabreez, to which I had previously called his attention, in accordance with the instructions conveyed to me in your telegram of the 8th December, M. Neratof said that this would have to be made the subject of a special arrangement with the Persian Government in return for the creation of a force to maintain order in the north. M. Neratof then proceeded to enquire whether the Russian Government could count on your support, should they wish to put forward any particular candidate for the post of Prime Minister. I replied that this was a question which I could not answer, but that I knew that you had, in a recent conversation with Count Benckendorff, spoken of the possibility of the two Governments securing a Persian Government that would be well-disposed towards Russia. His Excellency expressed his concurrence when I suggested that it would perhaps be best that M. Poklewski should submit to Sir George Barclay any proposals which the Russian Government might think it desirable to make for the purpose of placing Perso-Russian relations on a more stable and friendly basis. Sir George Barclay would then be able, after discussing them with M. Poklewski, to furnish you with his views with regard to them. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. No. 257. Sir G.

NERATOF.109 their most energetic support for the establishment of normal relations between Russia and Persia, as well as for the formation and maintenance of a Cabinet well disposed towards Russia. The Imperial Ministry is in a position to declare that the Russian detachment concentrated at Kazvin will not continue its march on Tehran before the 8th (21st) December, unless the Russian Minister is obliged, in the event of the situation becoming threatening, to call up troops to the capital before that date. The Imperial Government are animated by the desire to recall the said detachment from Kazvin as soon as possible, and they intend to put this design into execution as soon as the Persian Government shall have submitted to the demands which have been presented to them. The Russian Government trust that no new incident will intervene, such as acts of violence against the person of a Russian agent, an attack against Russian institutions or our troops, acts of provocation against Russia, disorders in general, &amp;c. Acts of such a character would obviously render the recall of the detachment impossible. St. Petersburgh, November 27 (December 10), 1911. No. 258. Sir G.

(P'glggj’g^ppjQ^^ Jl ehran, Decembe'r 11, 1911. REFERENCE to my telegram dated the 8th December. In a private letter yesterday to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I expressed the hope that the efforts which are being made to induce the Medjliss to accept the Russian demands would be successful, and I reiterated the views expressed in your telegram of the 30th November. In conversation this morning, Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that Cabinet had undergone certain changes, and that it would be presented to Medjliss to-day in its new form. His Excellency assured me that the changes that have been made were such as inspired the full confidence of the Medjliss, adding^ that the Medjliss intended to invest the Cabinet with full powers to come to terms with Russia on lines which would not conflict with the independence of Persia. Minister for Foreign Affairs added that the Cabinet had decided to make the immense sacrifice of dismissing the treasurer-general, and would agree to second demand in the Russian ultimatum if it were modified as follows: “In engaging foreigners in Persian service, Persian Government will try to avoid any difficulties which might injure the interests of the Powers.’ In reply, I remarked that this formula differed from that which he had proposed to Russian Minister (please refer to my telegram of the 8th December), but Minister for Foreign Affairs maintained the wording cited above. Minister for Foreign Affairs further stated that third demand would be complied with on the condition that Persian Government were assured that Russia would not press for a large indemnity, but would only ask for such sum as could be paid by Persia in her extreme penury. TT . ^ ^ t n In conclusion, his Excellency begged that His Majesty s Government would use their good offices to bring about the retention of the troops at Kazvin while negotiations were proceeding. No. 260. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 11.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, December 11, 1911. ^ THE Minister for Foreign Affairs told me this morning that he was instructing the Persian Minister in London to express to you the desire of the Persian Government110 to take part in the conversations which he had heard were now proceeding between His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government as to a programme to regulate the relations between the two Powers and Persia. The Persian Government also desired to be a party to any tripartite agreement which might be the outcome of these conversations. The Persian Government, his Excellency said, were very desirous of being freed from the many preoccupations which had hitherto prevented them from dealing with the internal situation ; they were in consequence most anxious to secure a stable basis of good relations with Russia; it would be easier to achieve this end were the Persian Government to participate in the present conversations, as they would be thus enabled to make their views known and to prepare the ground in Persia for the acceptance of an eventual agreement should any be reached. The Persian Government might otherwise be confronted with some agreement concluded between Great Britain and Russia which they would find it impossible to accept. No. 261. Sir Edivard Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, December 11, 1911. YOUR telegram of 8th December. Your language approved. W e will accept amended text if M. Sazonow confirms it. No. 262. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, December 11, 1911. PERSIAN Minister informs me that dismissal of Shuster is practically agreed to. He represented very earnestly that some formula should be found about foreign advisers, and asked my intervention for this. I replied that 1 could promise nothing: Russia having announced demands, it was not consistent with her dignity to waive them. I should be very glad if formula could be found which, while giving sufficient assurance about future foreign advisers, would be easier in form for Persian Government to accept, but this I thought could best be discussed direct with Russian Minister at Tehran. You should inform Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, and say that, if Russian Government think any concession can be made in point of form without sacrificing substance, Sir G. Barclay will be instructed to co-operate at Tehran in getting Persians to accept it. Persian Minister asked me to-day that if any changes other than those affected by the three fundamental Russian demands were required, they should be settled quietly in consultation with Persian Government, and that no public demands should be put forward. I replied that I would be ready to use all my influence in this direction when once the three demands had been complied with, provided I was assured of real desire of Persian Government to co-operate with the two Powers. No. 263. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Foreign Office, December 11, 1911. THE Persian Minister called on the 5th instant to ask unofficially whether His Majesty’s Government would be disposed to take steps towards requesting the Russian Government to refrain from advancing their troops further than Kazvin, so as to give time to the Persian Government to discuss in what manner they could best meet the wishes of the Russian Government. Sir A. Nicolson told Mehdi Khan that he thought that the best and most direct plan would be for the Persian Government to converse with the Russian Minister atTehran—as His Majesty’s Government could hardly, as matters now stand, act in the manner proposed. I am, &amp;c. E. OBEY. No. 264. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Foreign Office, December 11, 1911. THE Persian Minister called at this Office on the 8th instant. He was especially anxious that His Majesty’s Government should endeavour to induce the Bussian Government to modify the second of their demands on the Persian Government. Sir A. Nicolson told Mehdi Khan that some time back, before the present crisis, both legations had made a similar request to the Persian Government on two occasions. It was not done with the object of curtailing in any way Persian independence, but for the simple motive of avoiding any subsequent friction and complications.

' THE Minister for Foreign Affairs’ assurance to me yesterday as to the extent of confidence placed in the new Cabinet by the Medjliss has not been fulfilled. 1 have just learnt that the reason why the new Cabinet was not formally presented to the Medjliss was that the latter would not consent to authorise the Cabinet to effect a settlement of the present dispute with Russia. The attitude of the Medjliss had left my informant without any hope that there was a chance of their proving complaisant; he hinted, however, that the Cabinet was determined to settle with Russia, and that they would find some other means than the consent of the Medjliss.

CONVEYS substance of the following extract from a despatch dated the 13th December:— In a conversation which I had with M. Neratof on the 12th instant, I told him that I had been rather disappointed to find that the language of his aide-memoire (see my telegram of the 10th December) was not quite so precise as he had led me to hope. His Excellency, however, would not admit this, and maintained that the assurances which it recorded both with regard to the ex-Shah and to the eventual withdrawal of the Russian troops were quite explicit. I subsequently urged his Excellency to try to find some formula for the presentation of the second demand that would render it more acceptable to the Persian Government, and suggested that this might be done by substituting the word “ consultation ” for “ consent.” M. Neratof, however, replied that this was impossible, and also declined to consider several other suggestions which I submitted to him. He could not, he said, make any concession as regarded the tenour of the demand in question, though he was willing to admit a modification of its text. He had already authorised M. Poklewski to try and find a formula that would take more account of Persian susceptibilities, and he would not insist on the retention of the words “ consent ” and “ engages to ” if suitable equivalents could be found. He would, for example, be satisfied were the Persian Government to declare that they would not in future engage foreign advisers without a previous entente or “ accord ” with the two legations. On my communicating to him the substance of your conversation with the Persian Minister, reported in your telegram of the 11th December, M. Neratof said that he was very glad that you had held such language to his Excellency. He thanked me for the assurance which you had authorised me to give him that Sir G. Barclay would be instructed to discuss with M. Poklewski any proposals which the latter might submit for the purpose of placing Russo-Persian relations on a more friendly and stable footing, and that you would approach all such proposals with a sincere desire to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Imperial Government. His Excellency added that M. Poklew’ski would not fail to communicate to Sir G. Barclay any proposals that the Imperial Government might think it advisable to make with regard to the general political situation ; but I gathered that he did not think that it would be necessary to do so with regard to matters which concerned Russian interests exclusively. 1 have, &amp;c.

Buchanan. Sir, Foreign Office, December 12, 1911. COUNT BENCKENDORFF told me to-day that M. Sazonow had said to him in Paris that he was determined to maintain not only the Anglo-Russian Convention, but also the entente between Great Britain and Russia that depended on it. After reading the general lines of policy with regard to Persia that I had laid down, M. Sazonow had said that he saw nothing to object to in them, but the Russian troops in Tabreez and Ardebil could be withdrawn only when order was made very secure. I explained to Count Benckendorff that 1 had been bound to add the stipulation as to Russian troops in Tabreez and Ardebil, because otherwise my memorandum might ha.ve seemed to imply that the original conditions on which they had been sent there had disappeared, and that the occupation was to be regarded as permanent as far as those troops were concerned. I went on to say that, when the three Russian demands had been complied with, we ought to co-operate to put the Persian Government on their feet. We had suggested, some time ago, that British officers might be employed by the Persian Government to organise a Persian force to protect the southern roads. In the same way, eventually, a Persian police force might be organised under Russian officers to give protection in the north. If that was done, we might find some time hence that order was more secure in northern Persia than it had ever been during recent years, and then all Russian troops might be withdrawn. The outcome of the present difficulties might thus be a more favourable situation than there had yet been. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. No. 273. Sir G.

Minister for Foreign Affairs visited Russian Minister last evening and proposed another formula for second demand as follows :— “As regards engagement of foreign officials or officers needed by Persia for the organisation of the public services, Persia, animated by the desire to maintain on all occasions the best relations with Great Britain and Russia, will see to it that the choice of these persons shall not be such as to injure the legitimate interests of the two Powers in Persia. Consequently the Persian Government will be ready, as regards these officers and officials, to enter into an exchange of views with the two legations.” Minister for Foreign Affairs assured the Russian Minister that, if the Russian Government would accept this formula, the Persian Government would accept the other two demands. If Medjhss refused consent it would be dissolved. Russian Minister is submitting the above to his Government.114 ■ No. 274. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 13.)

Minister for Foreign Affairs sent a message to the Russian Minister, after a Cabinet Council last night, to the effect that the assurances given as regards compliance with the Russian demands were conditional on an assurance from Russia that the troops would be recalled from Kazvin immediately after the demands had been accepted. Minister for Foreign Affairs expects that compliance with the demands will render the Minister^ the objects of an outburst of popular indignation, and he tells me that it will be impossible for the Cabinet to take the very grave step of dissolving the Medjliss—which is a necessary preliminary to the acceptance of the^ demands—unless they are assured that the troops will be withdrawn; the Cabinet will then have some argument with which they may hope to pacify the popular indignation. In order to make it clear that the legations must be consulted in the case of every appointment, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has amended his formula for the second demand by inserting the words “engagement of” in the final sentence between “as regards” and “these officers.” No. 276.

St. Petersburgh, December 14, 1911. CONVEYS substance of the following despatch, dated the 19th December :— Sir, I have the honour to report that M. Sazonow returned to St. Petersburgh on the 13th of this month, and resumed the direction of foreign affairs. On the following evening I was received by his Excellency, and after congratulating him on his restoration to health, I proceeded to speak of the present situation in Persia, and of the grave preoccupation which it was causing you, dwelling more especially on the serious consequences that might follow an occupation of Tehran by Russian troops. M. Sazonow said that Count Benckendorff, when he had been in Paris, had also spoken to him in much the same sense, but that he trusted that the misapprehensions and suspicions with which Russia’s recent action in Persia had been regarded in certain quarters in England had now been dissipated. In any case he begged that I would assure you that he had not the smallest wish to order an advance on Tehran, and that he hoped that all necessity for such a step would be removed by a speedy compliance with the Russian demands. Proceeding next to discuss these demands one by one, M. Sazonow explained that, as regarded the first, a simple engagement to dismiss Mr. Shuster would not suffice, and that the Russian troops would not be withdrawn until that gentleman’s appointment in the Persian service had been formally cancelled. In reply to my question as to whether he meant by this that Mr. Shuster must have actually left Tehran, his Excellency said that if it was absolutely necessary that he should remain on there for a short time, it must be on the distinct understanding that he took no part whatsoever, either directly or indirectly, in the affairs of the Government. The second demand, respecting the engagement of foreign advisers, was, M. Sazonow remarked, the one which the Persian Government apparently found the [503] I ‘&gt;116 most difficulty in accepting. They had now professed their readiness to accept a formula to the following effect; « xhe Persian Government, animated by the desire to maintain on all occasions the best relations with Great Britain and Russia, will see to it that the choice of these persons shall not be such as to injure the legitimate interests of the two Powers m Persia. The Persian Government will consequently be ready, as regards these officers and officials, to enter into an exchange of views with the two legations. He on his part would be disposed to meet their wishes on this point, provided that the words u to arrive at an understanding were substituted for the voids to enter into an exchange of views,” as the latter were far too vague and constituted no real engao-ement. I remarked that the amendment proposed by his Excellency seemed to me^to take away all the value of the new formula from the Persian point of view, as an exchanop of views left the door open for discussion and was not so binding as an engagement to come to an understanding. After some further _ discussion I suggested a compromise between the two, according to which the Persian Government would en^ao’e “ to enter into an exchange of views for the purpose of (or with a view to) arriving at an understanding with the two legations.” M Sazonow accepted this suggestion favourably, but said that he could not take a final decision until the text had been submitted to the Emperor for approval. With regard to the question of an indemnity, M. Sazonow gave me the assurance that he had no intention of being hard on the Persian Government or of endeavouring to extort some large sum from them.

Purchase is now practically impossible, and we have only enough in hand of many necessary articles for one day more. Some energetic local action will be forced upon us, unless the central Government can be induced to take immediately effective measures to stop this scandalous state of things. “ The attitude of the local authorities is excessively obstructive. The karguzar clearly indicates his own approval of the action of the mullahs by writing to me officially that the local authorities cannot interfere with the mullahs. “ I shall warn the karguzar when I call on him this afternoon that the local authorities are incurring very serious responsibility in not attempting to check the hostile agitation.

The Russian Minister again told the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday that as soon as the Persian Government complied with the three demands the Russian Government would begin to withdraw the troops from Kazvin. This assurance is, of course, subject to the conditions referred to at the end of the aide-memoire handed to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh by M. Neratof (see Sir G. Buchanan’s telegram of 10th December), and the Russian Government may possibly construe as acts of provocation the anti-Russian agitation throughout Persia in which the clergy with the Ulema of Nejef have now joined. The Russian Minister also informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he would accept, with a slight amendment, the latter’s formula for the second demand (see my telegram of 13th December). The submission of the Persian Government thus seems to be facilitated, but even though a sufficient number of deputies have, as I understand, resigned their seats so that there will be no quorum in the Medjliss, it is by no means certain whether, in view of the popular indignation which the Cabinet are much afraid of, they will have the courage to comply with the Russian demands. They, doubtless, foresee that if there should be any delay in withdrawing the troops the general indignation will be intensified.hr No. 289. Sir G.

PERSIAN Minister has again made earnest appeal to me desiring assurances about second Russian demand to be private. I pointed out that Russia, having put forward demand publicly, could not be expected to be satisfied with private assurances thus giving impression in public that demand had been waived. I said I understood a formula had been proposed by Persian Government, which Russian Government were considering sympathetically, though it would require strengthening. When pressed for assurances about withdrawal of troops and other matters I said I would add nothing to assurances given direct by Russian Minister to Persian Government about troops, and generally that I could not assume position of mediator. Russian Government would naturally, after all that had passed, not accept mediation concerning three demands. Till these were complied with there was very little I could do; after they were settled my influence for future measures helpful to Persia would be used as outlined in my speech in Parliament on Thursday. Persian Minister said that public feeling against Russian demands was intense, and beyond control of Persian Govern ment. Unless the demands were made easy in form, and assurance were given regarding immediate withdrawal of newly-arrived troops, the Persian Government were powerless to do anything.

The Russian Minister learns from Sardar Assad that one more effort will be made to pass the Russian demands through the Medjliss. Until the result of this effort is seen the resignations of the Moderate deputies will not become effective. The Medjliss wall sit on Tuesday, and if it again refuses to give satisfaction to Russia the above- mentioned resignations will be made effective; it will then be announced that the present Medjliss has ceased to exist. The real truth is, I believe, that the public agitation has frightened those deputies who had been induced to resign into withdrawing their resignations. Althouoh the patriotic demonstrations which marked the days immediately succeeding the ultimatum have ceased of late the influence of the clergy is having a powerful effect on public [503] i 4 F120 opinion, and the feeling against compliance with the demands is growing. A Russian boycott which has been in operation for some time appears to grow rather than to diminish. No. 297. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received December 18.) gj r Tehran, November 22, 1911. THE Electoral Law was-passed by the Medjliss on the 22nd October, and was ratified by the Regent on the 4th instant. The wording of His Highness’s rescript shows that he desires to make it quite clear that he entirely dissociates himself from the provisions which the law contains, as he says that he passed it on to the Minister of the Interior at once, without having had time even to read it. The Electoral Law of 1909 provided for 120 members of Parliament and for elections through electoral colleges. The present law, of which I transmit a translation herewith, provides for 136 members and for direct elections in accordance with a schedule’which forms an appendix to the Electoral Law. The principal provinces are allotted the following number of representatives :— Azerbaijan Khorassan Arabistan Kermanshah Kerman and Baluchistan Mazanderan Ispahan Tehran Pars .. Ghilan Yezd .. Azerbaijan and Tehran are unchanged as compared to the last Electoral Law, but Ears is allotted 13 members instead of 8, while the remainder show practically no change. It is, perhaps, not a matter for surprise that although the last Electoral Law provided for the election of 120 representatives there never have been more than 80 present in Tehran, and the divisions usually show an attendance of between 60 and 70 deputies. The present law provides practically for universal suffrage, the only important qualification being 6 months’ residence in the electoral district. Political offenders who have taken action against the Government are now added to the list of persons disqualified both from electoral rights and candidature for election. The important change, of course, is from indirect to direct elections, and it remains to be seen how this system will prove practicable in a country where no census has ever been taken.

The necessary expenses pertaining to the elections shall be paid by the Government, with the knowledge of the local governors. Art. 52.—If ever a member of tbe National Consultative Assembly should resign or die, and more than three months remain of the session, the people of the place (his constituency) shall elect (another representative) in his place, but if the people of the place (his constituency) have not elected their own representative within three months from the date of notice, the National Assembly shall elect a person in the place of the representative who has died or resigned. ’therefore in some doubt as to how to act on his instructions, which he received on the 14th instant, to break off relations with the Cabinet. He telegraphed to his Govern ment that if the new Cabinet when formed did not forthwith satisfy the two demands — i.e., tender a formal apology and substitute Persian Cossacks on the properties in question for the Treasury gendarmes—he would break off relations with it. In reply, he was instructed to break off relations at once. His Government had informed him as to the measures they contemplated in the event of the Persian Government’s refusing to satisfy the two demands. These measures were the dispatch of a Russian force to Kazvin to permit of a detachment’s being summoned by him to Tehran to remove the Treasury gendarmes from Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s properties, and M. Poklewski had recommended that, in order to make sure of the attainment of the object in view, a force of 4,000 men should be sent. M. Poklewski was now informed that orders had been given to the Caucasus authorities to dispatch these troops. On the 18th November the Russian Minister carried out his instructions, sending his chief dragoman to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to say that his relations with the Government were severed, and that for the conduct of current affairs communications were to be addressed to his staff. He added that troops were being dispatched. Vosuk-ed-Dowleh, who though he had resigned was still carrying on the affairs of his Ministry, at once sent his “ chef de cabinet,” Moin-el-Vezireh, to beg me to convey to you an appeal from the Persian Government to mediate at St. Petersbnrgh with a view to suspending the dispatch of troops. Moin-el-Vezireh stated that a Cabinet was on the eve of formation, and assured me that all indications pointed to the new Ministry’s giving prompt satisfaction to Russia’s two demands. On the 20th, Moin-el-Vezireh again visited me, and stated that if the Persian Government were assured that the troops would be withdrawn on the satisfaction of the two demands, and that their presence would not be used to put forward other demands, the Minister for Foreign Affairs would apologise as soon as the Cabinet was formed, and the gendarmes would be withdrawn from Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s properties and be replaced by Persian Cossacks. I notice that a similar communication was on the same day made to yon by the Persian Minister in London when he asked, on behalf of his Government, for the advice of His Majesty’s Government. On the receipt of the instructions contained in your telegram of the 20th November, I let the Persian Government know verbally and by pro-memorid that His Majesty’s Government had reason to believe that, if they satisfied the two demands, the Russian troops would be withdrawn, and I added that it would be wiser for the Persian Government to comply without loss of time. I made this communication on the morning of the 21st, and the same evening Vosuk-ed-Dowleh sent me a message that Samsam-es-Sultaneh had at last formed his Cabinet, which would be presented on the following day. Moin-el-Vezireh who brought me the message was to ask me to express to you the gratitude of the Minister for Foreign Affairs for your good offices and advice. He was to add that my communication had been discussed by the members of the new Cabinet and by the prominent deputies of the Medjliss, with the result that it had been decided that after the Cabinet had been presented to the Medjliss on the following day, the two demands would be satisfied forthwith. The Cabinet was introduced to the Medjliss in a somewhat incomplete form on the 22nd November, and Moin-eLVezireh called in the evening to say that the Vosuk- ed-Dowleh, who had resumed his portfolio but had been, owing to indisposition, unable to attend at the Medjliss, hoped to be well enough to tender the formal apology on the following day, and that the gendarmes would be replaced by Cossacks as soon as possible. Early on the 24th I received a further letter from Moin-el-Vezireh, asking me when the Russian Minister would receive the formal apology from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and stating that Persian Cossacks had already replaced the Treasury gendarmes on Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s property. An appointment for Vosuk-ed-Dowlehs visit was made for the afternoon, and at 2 , 30 he called on the Russian Minister in his official robes and tendered the desired apology. By this time the Treasury gendarmes on the principal property had already been replaced by Persian Cossacks, and parties of the latter force had been dispatched to take over the properties in the suburbs^ After receiving the apology of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Russian Minister told his Excellency that he was authorised to resume relations with the Cabinet, but that, in view of the delay which had occurred in complying with his Government’s two demands and in view of the fact that some of the Russian troops had already landed, he did not think that his Government would be entirely satisfied by the reparation accorded. They would probably present further demands, and this was all the more126 likely, seeing that since the presentation of the original demands Mr. Shuster had given further provocation by distributing among the public in Persia translations of his recent open letter to the press. I enclose a copy of a letter which I addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 23rd instant, and of his Excellency’s reply and my rejoinder. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 1 in No. 298. Sir G. Barclay to Moin-el-Vezireh. My dear Moin-el-Vezireh, Tehran, November 23, 1911. EVERY moment’s delay renders the chance of the withdrawal of the troops less. I am, therefore, intensely surprised that the gendarmes have not already been replaced by Persian Cossacks. The indisposition of Vosuk-ed-Dowleh was most unfortunate, and I wish he had been able to apologise yesterday. Yours, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 2 in No. 298. Moin-el-V ezireh to Sir G. Barclay. My dear Minister, Tehran, November 23, 1911. I HASTEN to state, in reply to your letter of this morning, that we have lost no time in acting upon the advice of your Government to comply with the Russian demands, on the express understanding that the Russian troops will be withdrawn forthwith. The real and personal properties will have been taken over this evening and the gendarmes relieved by Persian Cossacks. Vosuk-ed-Dowleh is still waiting to hear from your Excellency at what time he can execute proposal No. 2. I am glad to say that he is better to-day. Yours, &amp;c. HUSSEIN KHAN. Enclosure 3 in No. 298. Sir G. Barclay to Moin-el-Vezireh. My dear Moin-el-Vezireh, Tehran, November 23, 1911. I MUST, in reply to your note just received, point out that there is no express understanding that the Russian troops will be withdrawn forthwith. You will remember that the phrase used was “ have reason to believe,” which exactly expressed the state of the case at mid-day on Tuesday. As soon as the Russian Minister learns from Colonel Vadbolski that the gendarmes have been replaced by Persian Cossacks, he will be ready to receive the Minister for Foreign Affairs in “ khilaat ” for the apology. Yours, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 299. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 18.) ^ _ Tehran, November 25, 1911. IN continuation of my despatch of the 28th ultimo, I have the honour to report that the engagement reported in that despatch in the neighbourhood of Bander Gez seems to have been more serious than at lirst appeared, a Government force of some 600 men having been completely defeated by the ex-Shah’s brother Shoa-es- Sultaneh and 700 Turkomans. I have no more recent information on which I can rely,but the whole district of Astrabad appears to have fallen back into the ex-Shah’s hands. dhe situation at Tabreez has been somewhat relieved, Shuja-ed-Dowleh having allowed several of the roads leading to the town to be opened for the importation of provisions, in order, it is believed, that the villagers should be enabled to sell their produce, and thus be a more profitable prey to his exactions. A deputation of the townspeople visited him at Basminch to open negotiations a week or two ago, but these have led to nothing, and he still threatens the town with a force of some 1,500 men. There was talk at one time of sending troops from Tehran to deal with him, but, so far, these plans have not materialised. Salar-ed-Dowleh was pursued into Luristan by the Bakhtiaris under Sardar Bahadur, who, according to reports received by the Government, inflicted a second defeat on him in the neighbourhood of Burujird on or about the 16th November. He had with him at the time some 2,000 horsemen, 500 of whom are reported to have been killed or wounded. His present whereabouts is unknown. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 300. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 18.) Sir, Tehran, November 27, 1911. IN my despatch of the 31st October I alluded to the possibility of the increase in our consular escorts making its moral effects felt in a diminution of disorder on the southern roads. So far this seems to have been the case as regards the Shiraz-Bushire road,- as, except for the robbery on the 4th November of a small caravan of local produce and telegraph stores at the hands of Kashgais near Kazerun, and the attack on the caravan convoying the two Japanese reported in my telegram of the 20th November, no robberies have been reported to me since the two squadrons of Indian cavalry left Bushire on the 2nd instant, and a telegram received to-day from the acting consul at Shiraz states that ordinary caravans are moving fairly freely, though the authorities profess themselves unable to provide guards for the passage of caravans conveying specie, which is urgently needed by the Imperial Bank of Persia at Shiraz. At the same time it was thought necessary that the sepoys leaving Ispahan on their return to India should not travel alone between Kazerun and Bushire, in consequence of a report from Mr. Vice-Consul Chick, who accompanied the cavalry as far as Kazerun, and on his way south had an opportunity of gauging the effect on the local tribal chiefs of the passage of our troops. He stated that the chiefs were considerably exercised as regards the question of “ rahdari,” or illegal road tax, which culminated on one occasion in an imprudent road guard firing off his rifle to intimidate one of the muleteers belonging to the troops’ caravan. His rifle and those of the other tufangchis were confiscated. This incident and the inaccurate reports in local news papers of the future intentions of the British Government as regards the employment of the troops as caravan escorts seems to have put the khans in a dangerous temper. As regards the Shiraz-Ispahan road there is no improvement to report, His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan reporting on the 11th November that on the Shiraz road there was practically no caravan traffic, and repeating the same remark on the 18th November. One caravan on its way to Kumisheh was attacked near Orchini Pass by Kuhgeluis. On the 8th November the merchants of Ispahan telegraphed to the Minister of the Interior protesting against the insecurity of the roads in general. The Bakhtiari road continues in a very unsatisfactory condition, but severe cold with a corresponding decrease of robbers is setting in. Large arrivals of merchandise formerly abandoned on the road are now reported. An attack on a caravan of 150 camels chartered by Messrs. Lynch occurred at Mai amir during the month, and on the 8th instant, near Gav Peeseh, two bags containing the whole of the kit of two sowar reliefs proceeding to the Ispahan consulate were stolen, the value of which I shall claim from the Persian Government as soon as I have received particulars. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY.128 No. 301. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 18.) gi r Tehran, November 28, 1911. THE past few weeks have been a period of protracted crisis, and Samsam-es- Sultaneh is still as far as ever from achieving that desideratum on which the Regent has always laid such stress—a strong Cabinet backed by a stable majority in the Mecljliss. As reported in my telegram of the 14th instant, the remnant of the Cabinet, composed only of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, resigned on the 13th instant. For weeks past Samsam-es-Sultaneh had been vainly endeavouring to fill the vacant posts, but he could not induce the Medjliss to accept his candidates. The post over which there was the greatest difficulty was that of Minister of the Interior, which the Medjliss insisted should be resumed by Kawam-es- Sultaneh, who had left the Cabinet owing to dissensions with the Prime Minister. Kawam-es-Sultaneh is an advanced democrat, and is more than ever inacceptable to Samsam-es-Sultaneh as a candidate for the Ministry of the Interior now that the elections are impending. It was, I believe, the difficulties Samsam-es-Sultaneh found in completing his Cabinet more than the Russian ultimatum which led him to resign. For ten days there was no Cabinet at all, and the Ministry, which Samsam- es-Sultaneh at length on the 22nd instant introduced to the Medjliss, only consisted of four members. It was introduced in this incomplete form in order not further to delay satisfaction of the two Russian demands in connection with the incident at Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s properties. Up to now the vacant posts have not been filled, the Medjliss still stubbornly refusing the candidates proposed by Samsam-es-Sultaneh. The artificial moderate majority in that assembly has disappeared, and the democrats, who have been joined by a section of the Medjliss which had hitherto wavered between the two parties, now appear to command a majority. No. 302. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edioard Grey.— (Received December 18.) Sir, Tehran, November 30, 1911. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia for the past four weeks. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 302. Summary of Events in Persia for the month of November. Tehran. The Cabinet. —After repeated crises, and considerable opposition on the part of a section of the Medjliss to the inclusion of Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh, the Cabinet was completed on the 29th November as follows : — Premier and Minister of the Interior Minister for Foreign Affairs Minister for War ... Minister for Finance Minister for Public Instruction Minister for Posts and Telegraphs ... Minister for Justice Samsam-es-Sultaneh. V osuk-ed-Dowleh. ; Sardar Mohtashem. Zoka-ul-Mulk. Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Moazed-es-Sultaneh. Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh. The Medjliss .—On the 31st October a Bill was passed abolishing the pensions and allowances of those who had risen against the Government since the general amnesty of 1909, and on the 9th November a further Bill was passed abolishing the pensions ofwell-known reactionaries to the extent of 18,785 tomans a-year, while certa'n other pensions were reduced. On the '2nd November a Bill was passed authorising the employment of ten more American officials for the Ministry of Finance, and a credit of 24,900 dollars a-year for their pay was voted. At this sitting an important letter addressed to the Medjliss by the Begent was read, in which His Highness threatened to resign if certain conditions were not fulfilled. A translation of this letter is annexed. Telegrams from Tabreez, Besht, Meshed, and some other towns, urging the Medjliss to prolong its session, were read at the same sitting, and after considerable debate on the 12th and 13th, a majority of 46 out of 69 votes decided, on the 13th November, that the session should he prolonged until just over half the members of the new Medjliss are in Tehran. The two years’ session of the Medjliss came to an end on the 14th November. A committee was chosen to discuss matters with the Begent in connection with his proposed resignation, and presented a report to the Medjliss which, however, was not read in public. The committee stated that in view of the Begent’s indisposition it was proposed that he should go to Europe on short leave after the formation of a Cabinet. On the 22nd November Samsam-es-Sultaneh presented three Cabinet Ministers by letter including Yosuk-ed-Dowleh as Foreign Minister, and on the 29th November, after a stormy debate, the Cabinet was completed as repoited above, forty-one deputies supporting it and eighteen rejecting it. Russian Demands .—The Bussian demands regarding Shoa-es-Sultaneh’s property were first delivered to the Persian Government on the 11th November. On the 23rd November the Treasury guards were removed from the property, and the following day the Foreign Minister tendered the desired apology to the Bussian Minister. On the 29th November the Bussian Minister presented Bussia’s ultimatum demanding Mr. Shuster’s dismissal within forty-eight hours. Miscellaneous .—On the 28th October Sardar Jang arrived at Tehran from Hamadan and Amir Mufakham froin Sultanabad. On the 3rd November Mr. Shuster sent Treasury guards to collect certain taxes from Ala-ed-Dowleh, who at once complained to the Prime Minister. Amir Mujahid and Sardar Jang accompanied Ala-ed-Dowleh back to his house and disarmed the Treasury guards. The Prime Minister eventually apologised to Mr. Shuster, and the incident was closed. Farman Farma left Tehran for Tabreez as Governor-General on the 4th November. A translation of Mr. Shuster’s letter to the “Times” was circulated largely at Tehran on the 12th November, a few days after it appeared in London. Prices continue to rise, and bread is very dear. His Highness the Regent to the President of the Medjliss. Nonember 11, 1911. I transmit to you a memorandum which I request you to submit to the careful consideration of the members of the Medjliss. As you are fully aware^ of the present state of affairs, I am sure you will agree that I am justified in sending this memorandum, and, in requesting you to explain it fully to the deputies, I hope that it will produce a satisfactory result. To the National Assembly : As the deputies are fully aware of the present state of affairs, any explanation is superfluous. I need only say that, as you are fully aware, for some time past the Cabinet has been incomplete and practically on the point of dissolution. Although the services rendered by His Highness Samsam-es-Sultaneh, the Premier, are well known to the State and nation, he has been so hampered by repeated crises and want of co-operation that he actually decided to hand in his resignation, which I have prevented him from doing. But it is obvious that without the formation and completion of the Cabinet, as well as the necessary co-operation, he cannot put his good intentions into execution. As a general election is at hand and troubles are apprehended next spring, it is obvious that if a Cabinet is not formed at once with the necessary co-operation of the [503] KMedjliss and does not put into execution a properly drawn up programme for the maintenance of security in the country on which the canning out Ol the elections greatly depends—and the prevention ot tiouble m the spring, and if die Medjhss does not approve of the measures proposed for the maintenance of order, it will he extremely difficult at this critical juncture to feel assured that the necessary measures for the prevention of future difficulties will be carried out. Under these circumstances, I need only point out the importance of the occasion and to express the hope that the Medjliss will give its full support to the Premier in his task of forming and completing the Cabinet and of drawing up a programme. Furthermore, I consider it necessary to say that, as I stated in my telegrams from Europe, the support of everyone is necessary to a constitutional Kegent and that party differences cause obstruction and bring about crises, and that therefore, seeing that tranquillity is absolutely essential under the present circumstances, such crises are detrimental to the interests of the country. - At the time when I went through certain legal formalities at ttm Medjiiss, 1 stated that if discord should unfortunately bring about further confusion in aftairs, I would not be able to continue to witness such an unfortunate state of affairs. But as from three months ago the signs of discord, and even of imputations against the Regency, which should be respected by all, became apparent—as is well known to all the deputies —1 at that time decided to resign the Regency. As, however, troubles of a most serious nature supervened, I had patience, and postponed the carrying out ol my lesolve lest it should be thought that I had been indifferent to my responsibilities. But in order that this matter should not take place unexpectedly without any preparations having been made, I took measures, during the last few days, to ask the deputies to consult with the authorities, and to take such measures as they may consider advisable. I there fore remind the Medjliss that if serious measures are not taken in this matter, I shall find myself forced to carry my decision into effect without any further prelimin aries, and to make the matter public. At the time of my going through the legal formalities at the Medjliss, I declared that no conscientious person could hold me respon sible for this act, and in trying to put an end to discord, I have made superhuman efforts, but I regret to say that they have proved vain. In my opinion, the deputies are responsible to the public, and it is incumbent upon them to devote their whole energies to the carrying out of these important affairs. They must not look upon themselves as freed from their responsibilities until they have arrived at a satisfactory solution of these difficulties. In conclusion, I must again insist on the importance of the occasion—-on the essential need of giving effect to the above-mentioned objects, and on the evil conse quences of their 'neglect. I point out my freedom from responsibility, and by doing my duty and drawing your attention to the above matters I liberate my conscience of all further obligation. Tabreez. There is no improvement in the situation at Tabreez. The investment of the town by Shuja-ed-Dowleh, at the head of some 2,000 followers, continues. The state of affairs in the town is very serious, and several of the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages have taken “ bast ” in the country seat of the Russian consul- general, as a protest against the miseries they are suffering. The townspeople have failed to come to terms with the Shuja-ed-Dowleh, and are powerless to relieve the situation unless the Government at Tehran intervenes.^ The presence of the Russian troops is, apparently, the only assurance for the maintenance of tranquillity, the Cossack battalion, which has fallen below strength owing to the departure of time* expired men, is to be relieved by a fresh battalion. Ghilan and Mazanderan. The British consular agent at Astrabad reports that Mohamed Ali is still at Khoja Kafas. Also that the Turkomans attacked the town on the 11th November, killing forty-seven men and capturing thirty-five, and that owing to their presence m the vicinity of Astrabad, large numbers of the inhabitants are taking refuge in the Russian consulate. &gt; , The Russian consular guard at Astrabad is to be strengthened by 200 Fossae s with two quick-firing guns, with a view to protecting Russian lives and property.The following Russian troops had arrived at Resht by the 27th November : 300 Cossacks, 1,720 infantry and artillery; total, 2,020, with 8 guns and 6 machine- guns. Meshed. Rukn-ed-Dowleh, the Governor-Generabelect of Khorassan, has not yet arrived. Nayer-ed-Dowleh is still endeavouring to induce the Government at Tehran again to separate Nishapur from Khorassan. Meshed itself is not in a disturbed state, but the roads in the vicinity are infested by robbers. Ispahan. The discontent in the town, owing to the dearness of provisions, is increasing. The province is in its normal state of insecurity, owing to the presence of Bakhtiari and Kuhgelui raiders. This state of affairs is adding to the unpopularity of the governor, Sardar Ashja. The chief merchants, who have protested to Tehran against the insecurity of the roads, would probably welcome the advent of even foreign troops for the policing the roads. The appointment of Mr. E. C. Haycock, a British subject, as agent to the treasurer- general, is giving evident satisfaction to the masses in Ispahan. The Governor- General, the former Treasury agent, and the clergy have failed in their attempts to organise any opposition to Mr. Haycock. Recruiting for the Treasury gendarmerie has commenced, and by the 11th November twenty-nine men had been enrolled. One squadron of Indian cavalry left Abadeh for Ispahan on the 27th November. Yezd. Amir Azem, the new Governor of Kerman, is failing to restore order and punish the participators in the recent disturbances in a satisfactory manner. The Taftis and other banditti infest the country, and render the roads unsafe. The telegraph wire has also been wrecked on several occasions. The Parsees, whose business is being carried on under increasing difficulties and losses, are apparently desirous of foreign intervention. Shiraz. Ala-ed-Howleh, the Governor-General-elect of Ears, has not yet left Tehran. On the 29th October a caravan from Ispahan for Shiraz was looted near Khani- khorreh, and Dr. Ross, who was travelling with it, was ill-treated and lost all her personal effects. She managed to reach Abadeh. On 'resuming her journey she was robbed a second time, aud had to return to Abadeh. On the 23rd November two squadrons of Indian cavalry reached Abadeh. One proceeds to Ispahan, and one escorts Miss Ross to Shiraz leaving on the 27th instant. On the night of the 24th-25th November, a band of thieves attacked a garden near the consulate, a brisk fusillade being kept up for some time. Two squadrons of Indian cavalry arrived at Shiraz on the 12th-13th November, There were no noteworthy incidents on the road. Several robberies are reported, but on the whole the state of unrest at Shiraz and district seems to be decreasing. Seistan. The state of the roads in Seistan and the Kainat is quiet, but caravans cannot travel without strong escorts. Kerman. The condition of the province of Kerman remains the same as reported in last month’s summary. The number of Baluchi robber bands is increasing, especially in the neighbourhood of Bam. One N ifat-i-Nizam, who has great influence with the Baluchis, is attempting to alienate men employed by the telegraph department, [503] K 2132 Kermanshah. His Maiesty’s consul reports that the situation is growing worse in Kermanshah, and that robberies are so frequent that he is placing British flags on warehouses containing British goods. Luristan. Official reports to the Central Government announce the defeat of Salar-ed-Dowleh by the Bakhtiari force under Sardar Bahadur on the 15th November, near Burujird. Salar-ed-Dowleh is reported to have lost about 500 killed and wounded and the Bakhtiaris about 50. Bushire. Tangistan is the chief centre of unrest where skirmishes between the followers of local headmen are of frequent occurrence. Ahwaz. The working of the telegraph line has been very unsatisfactory during the past month, and great inconvenience and loss has been caused to British firms at Ahwaz and Mohammerah. Extensive repairs are necessary. • .1 , Durino’ the first week in October one caravan left for Ispahan; since then the road has been closed as the Bakhtiari guards have fled owing to the prevalence of cholera There appears to be no hope of reducing the accumulation of goods at Ahwaz, and Messrs. Lynch Brothers are making arrangements for storing during the rainy season. Bunder Abbas. Five large caravans left for Kerman and Lar during the first week in October. Other trade routes are infested by several small parties of robbers, and no serious measures are ever taken against them by the local authorities. Ho. 303. Sir G.

The Cabinet laid two alternative proposals before the Medjliss yesterda} 7 : 1. That the Medjliss should give the Cabinet full powers to settle the Russo- Persian dispute. 2. That the Cabinet should be assisted in their task by a committee of the Medjliss ; no further reference to be made then to the Medjliss. Only five deputies voted for either of these proposals ; twenty-six voted against. As thirty-four deputies abstained from voting, the proportion of voting members did not constitute a quorum, and the votes on the proposals were therefore non- effective. The Minister for Foreign Affairs then recommended that a new Cabinet be formed to deal with the dangerous situation which had arisen. I am informed that the president of the Medjliss sent for the democrats at the close of the sitting and gave them a severe lecture. The Medjliss will, I understand, sit again to-day. No. 307. Sir G.

THE Persian Minister called at this Office on the 14th instant and communicated to Mr. Mallet the contents of a telegram from his Government to the effect that they had replied to the Russian Government by acceding to the demands of the latter, on condition that (1) some modification were made in the article respecting the engage ment of foreign advisers, for which they suggested a formula, which was apparently the one mentioned in your telegram of the 13th December ; (2) the amount of the indemnity and the mode of payment were fixed ; (3) the Russian troops were with drawn from Kazvin immediately after the demands had been accepted ; (4) no further demands were made; (5) facilities were at once afforded by the Russian and British banks for supplying the Persian Government with money ; and (6) the purchase of arms was at once facilitated. The Minister explained that the last two conditions were necessitated by the situation which would arise if the Russian demands were granted. Mehdi Khan further expressed the desire to know my views respecting the reply, and whether I would urge the Russian Government to accept the Persian Government’s conditions, which were their last word. He was informed, in reply, that I was not disposed to press the Russian Government further in the matter. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. No. 311. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 20.)

Several members of the British community at Yezd, which is composed principally of women and children, have represented to British vice-consul there that local authorities would be unable to afford adequate protection to foreigners in the event of troubles. He has also been approached by the Parsis with a request for assistance. Vice-consul, however, is of opinion that the foreign community is not at present in any danger. I would propose to send a portion of the Ispahan consular guard to Y r ezd in the event of danger to foreigners becoming imminent.

A good deal of desultory lighting took place in the streets near the Russian consulate up to about 4 o’clock ; these streets were held by a mere handful of Russian troops. There lias been no general disorder, in fact, the Persian population has remained perfectly quiet, and no Europeans have been molested so far as I have been able to ascertain at present. The Russians appear, however, to be having more difficulty in their task than might have been expected. Communication with the outlying members of the Britishi 37 colony lias been impossible.

The Minister of Foreign Affairs trusts that, now that the Persian Government have accepted the demands, effect will be given to the promises made by His Majesty’s Government to the Persian Minister in London, to the effect that the good offices of the British Government would be lent with a view to bringing about a complete reconciliation between Russia and Persia and the establishment of friendly and normal relations between the two countries. The Minister of Foreign Affairs states that he and his colleagues are determined not to swerve from the attitude of conciliation which they have shown in this matter, and he declares that the most strenuous efforts are being made to calm popular indignation, though their task is likely to be gravely impeded by the aggressive action of the Russians in Tabreez and Resht.

I HAVE received the following account from His Majesty’s vice-consul at Resht of an incident which has occurred there : — “ On the 21st December threats were exchanged between some sowars from Talieh and some Cossacks, who crossed each other in the street. Later on in the day Cossacks came to the Government House, said that shots had been fired from it, and searched the stables : they also searched the post and telegraph offices. Firing started suddenly, and at once became general. The escort of the Russian consul started firing on the Sabzmaidan. The immediate cause of the commotion is at present unascertain- able. Three Cossacks and at least eight Persians were killed. The proximity of Moharrem makes the situation dangerous.” The vice-consul also reports an affray at Enzeli on the 21st December, in which one Russian officer was wounded and ten Persians were killed.

G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 332. Acting Consul Knox to Sir G. Barclay. g* r Shiraz, September 7, 1911. I HAVE the honour to submit a review of events in Ears during the past two months. I regret that I have been led by the vain hope that this period might bring some definite modification in the state of affairs which could serve as a landmark for a clearer narrative, to delay so long the submission of this report, which will, 1 fear, only detail a monotony of chaos. - , , On the night of the 26th June the situation was further complicated by the departure of Intizam-el-Mamalek, the only male heir of the Kawami family. On receipt of the first news of this, Kawam-ul-Mulk sent through^ me^ a telephone message to the Kedkhoda of Sivend instructing him to detain his son there; two days later the message was delivered to Intizarn-el-Mamalek himself, who returned to Shiraz on the night of the 30th June. The object and result of this escapade sti remain equally obscure. # j x j This incident was closely followed by another which has kindled an unprecedented conflagration in Ears. In the course ol last autumn a party of Bulvardi villageis (a sedentary offshoot of a Kashgai tribe) had lost one of their number in a scuffle with Ah Akbar Dehbozoorgi. Shortly after the occurrence Kawam, then acting governor, attempted to arrest Ali Akba, who fled in the direction of Ispahan, and remained absent until the arrival of Nizam-es-Sultaneh, with whom he subsequently took service. The Bulvardis, after repeated attempts to obtain satisfaction of their blood feud, sent at the beginning of July a large number of women from their village to set their wrongs before the Adliyeh, which gave them an assurance in the name of the Governor-General that full reparation would be made in four days’ time. The men, however, were not satisfied with this, and on the fourth day came to town, about eighty strong, and installed themselves in the houses of some fellow-villagers near the Saadi (or north-eastern) gate. In the course of the night the Governor-General dispatched a force of police and others to arrest the brother of the murdered man, who was chiefly prosecuting the feud. The Bulvardis, however, refused to surrender him, and, after some ineffectual argument, exchanged shots with the police. On the next day the Bulvardis took possession of the town gate, strengthening their position with sangars, and from there gave out that they would leave as soon as Ali Akbar was handed over to them, but not before. No attempt was made to molest them during the day, but on the following night firing broke out generally through the town. This was, however, of a more or less inoffensive character, the Bulvardis and Governor-General’s men merely shooting in the air to denote vigilance, and many of the inhabitants joining in from their roofs in accordance with a time- honoured convention by which the people imply dissatisfaction with their governor, anc proclaim that the town is in a state of disorder. On the next morning Nizam-es- Sultaneh attempted to reassert his authority by blowing from a gun an elderly robber w io had been in prison for many months, at the same time tw r o of Kawam-ul-Mulk s coo s were led out to be hanged, under the accusation that they had not given the Governor-miinmii ■ 141 General warning of Intizam-ul-Mamalek’s intended departure, but were ultimately reprieved. Shortly after this the great majority of the more influential Mullahs took “ bast ” in a sacred building known as the u Seyyid Ali-ed-Din Hussein,” situated in the south eastern corner of the town. Of these Mullahs a considerable number had taken a prominent part in the anti-Kawami demonstrations of April and May. Their action was probably provoked by a wish to protest in self-defence against the high-handed action of the Governor-General which had recently culminated in the arrest of Zergham-es-Sherieh, the Imam Juma’s grandson. From all my investigations of the origin of these disturbances, I can only draw the conclusion that the outbreak was inspired by the personal grievance of the Bulvardis, who are of Kashgai stock, and in no way connected with Kawam’s family. The complaint so frequently made that the Kawamis had called in tribesmen to their assistance is quite unjustifiable, since the only appearance of tribesmen in their quarter which has been noticed up to the present date was a flying visit by two Baharlu chiefs, who sent off a telegram addressed to the Begent, and signed by a number of their compeers, in which they begged assurances that a solution of Shiraz affairs would soon be reached, failing which they declared that they would come in force to restore order themselves. After some ten days of general unrest, accompanied by incessant firing at night, Nizam-es-Sultaneh sent on the 17th July some of the leading merchants to treat with the Mullahs, who agreed to accept as conditions for their surrender a general amnesty and the exile of Ata-ed-Dowleh, Nasr-ul-Mulk, Beha-es-Sultaneh, and Moghis-ed- Dowleh. A few hours later the Governor-General’s force, which had lately been reinforced by a considerable number of Kashgai villagers, made a concerted attack on three points of the eastern quarters, whence they were repulsed with a loss of about thirty killed. Following on this, Nizam-es-Sultaneh dispatched two small forces of cavalry to Servistan, where Kawam owns large estates. Meanwhile the Sorkhis and other Kashgai villagers had been actively employed in the pillage of the immediate neighbourhood of Shiraz, in the intervals of frequent attacks on the eastern quarters, and on the 23rd July a number of tribesmen arrived from Soulet-ed-Dowleh, One body of about sixty of these men even forced their way into a garden, occupied by Messrs. Ziegler’s manager, in spite of the protests of the Persian guard, and were only with much difficulty persuaded to leave. After representations to the Governor- General half-a-dozen men were beaten in the presence of the consulate Mirza as satisfaction for this invasion of a British subject’s domicile, but I have a strong suspicion that those thus punished were in no way connected with the incident. About this time, since the lawlessness of the Kashgais showed every sign of increasing, I telegraphed, with your approval, to Soulet-ed-Dowleh pointing out how the Kashgais were behaving in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, requesting him to telegraph immediately to put a stop to this. Some days later I learned that Soulet had sent strong orders to his men not to pillage—-which were completely disregarded—and about ten days after dispatch of my telegram I received a letter from him stating that he had done so. Attacks on the eastern quarters of the town still continue at short intervals and with complete insuccess, the Kashgais and their allies having lost, on their own confession, about 200 killed. The other party, remaining entirely on the defensive, have suffered far less severely, and have not as yet yielded a single foot of ground. Since the outbreak of disorder in Shiraz the completest anarchy has prevailed in most of the outlying districts and particularly in those of Darab and Fesa, where the Baharlu and Mezidi Arabs, having captured a field-gun from a party of Government troops sent to collect taxes, proceeded to besiege the town of Fesa and devastate the neighbourhood, and at the same time gave it to be understood that they were preparing to come to Shiraz in force in order to protect a widow of Nasr-ed-Dowleh who is closely related to their chiefs. The fact of the two chiefs already mentioned actually coming in and dispatching their telegram to the Begent seems to give some support to their boast. Throughout the course of these disturbances I have been frequently pressed hy various parties to act as peacemaker, but I have been obliged to decline any association of the name of His Majesty’s consulate with the overtures of any factionpn Bars. At the same time, however, I have used as far as possible my influence both with Nizam-es- Sultaneh and Kawam-ul-Mulk in the direction of a peaceful settlement, having, while urging general moderation on the former, pointed out to him privately more than once the objections to his persisting in violent measures only calculated to exasperate a resistance which had already shown that it could not be overcome without the greatest142 difficulty and considerable danger to the peaceful part of the population and to European interests, any damage to which could not but react most unpleasantly upon himself. Kawam too I have frequently warned of the prejudice resulting to his own position from any injudicious action of his family and on every occasion when I have requested it he has written to them in the terms I desired, and has also whenever any question of peace has come forward invariably urged upon his dependents to meet any advance in a conciliatory spirit. Since it has appeared to me most inexpedient that we should assume any degree of responsibility in connection with the quarrels of these parties, I have replied to all overtures that I have no authority to associate myself in any way with these negotiations. In the matter of Kawam-ul-Mulk’s departure from the consulate I regret to report that no tangible progress has yet been made. The statement of the Persian Government to the effect that they were satisfied with the assurances given for his safety was communicated to him on the 9th July. Kawam replied to this that the fact that Nizam-es-Sultaneh was then threatening to attack his family without provocation was proof of the worthlessness of his assurances, and added that he would voluntarily leave the consulate only on one of the following conditions :—• That the Persian Government should give an undertaking to farm his estates during his absence from Persia, and should pay his debts and serve him a pension out of the proceeds with the understanding that he should re-enter into possession on his return. That the Persian Government should give to you formal assurances (to be communicated by me to him in writing together with the statement that you were satisfied with their validity) that the lives and freedom of his family and the integrity of his estates will be respected. That if a Governor-General of Ears with no personal animosity towards himself be appointed, he is willing to give through me a written assurance that he will leave Persia for so long as the Government may direct without any guarantees. Subsequently, when pressed by Nizam-es-Sultaneh for a statement on the subject of the assurances given to you by the Central Government, I told him the substance of the first two of these proposals, adding that I had informed you fully of their nature. After this Nizam-es-Sultaneh himself approached Kawam, promising him every guarantee for his safety. The latter has, however, confined himself to replying that any assurances on this count must reach him through the intermediary of His Majesty’s Legation. No further proposal was made until the 11th August, when Samsam-es-Sultaneh telegraphed to Kawam that the necessary guarantees for his safety would be given through the Regent and His Majesty’s consulate ; that, on his leaving Ears, he would be appointed Governor of Kerman and his son chief of the “five tribes,” and that suitable security would be found for the safety of his estates. To this suggestion Kawam replied that it was indispensable that he should spend at least forty days in his own house before leaving the province, so that he might set in order his own affairs and those of the heirs of Nasr-ed-Dowleh. From what little I have seen of the attitude of Soulet-ed-Dowleh, it seems tolerably certain that he is still ready to give every support he can to Nizam-es-Sultaneh, but his authority, which has now been waning for some eighteen months, appears this summer to have dwindled more rapidly than before, and quite recently a strong group of the chiefs of various tribes, headed by Mohamed Ali Khan, Kashkuli, Ayyaz Kikha, Harashuli, and Ahmed Khan, Shishbolooki, wrote formally to him declining in future to pay any further “ maliat,” since that of the past three years had only gone to swell his coffers, and pointing out the reproach he had cast on the Kashgais as a whole by abetting Nizam in the murder of Nasr-ed-Dowleh. Taking into consideration the traditional loyalty of these tribesmen to their acknowledged ilkhani, such language can only be considered as most significant. There seems thus at present no prospect of any improvement in the state of the province. The Governor-General has given every proof of his impotence to make any impression on the revolted quarters. He has consistently shown during his tenure of office here that his word can under no circumstances be relied on, and that the only consideration able to influence him is the direct anticipation of pecuniary gain. Thus it may reasonably be expected that his opponents will continue to remain quietly on the defensive until his dismissal may be successfully undertaken. There cannot, I think, be two opinions as to the urgency of removing a Governor-General whose sole intrigues have led to such formidable chaos, and who makes no secret of his revolutionary intentions ; but the Persian Government,' with their own more obvious troubles facing them, are no doubt in a most difficult position, and the ultimateeventuality of their taking a strong line in this matter—which to my mind alone offers any hope of success—seems unfortunately remote. At the beginning of August the Government had, it appears, arrived as near as can reasonably be expected of them to some decision, and they had certainly gone far enough for the karguzar, Nizam himself, and his private secretary all to inform me that he had been officially recalled, and for the Prime Minister to telegraph officially in the same sense to the chief mujtehids and the commander of the forces, yet the inadequate measure of placing in charge of Fars at this juncture so flaccid a deputy governor as Yedullah Mirza could only entail the rein statement of a Governor-General rendered doubly noxious by his incomplete disgrace. To sum up this despatch, there are at present some 2,000 armed men, Kashgais, .Dashtistanis, and villagers, with Nizam-es-Sultaneh in the western half of the town. In the eastern part there are about 1,000 townsmen and peasants from the neighbouring districts ; collisions between these two parties ending in considerable bloodshed are of almost daily occurrence, and sufficient feuds have already resulted to keep the province in a ferment for a whole generation. Added to this the southward migration of the Kashgais is bringing nearer the arrival of Soulet-ed-Dowleh and the possible renewal of his policy of last May ; there is also a reasonable probability that the still wilder Khamseh tribesmen will take their share in the general medley, which, with a Governor-General approaching perilously near to open revolt, cannot but become more threatening. All these considerations seem to require that we should be prepared, in the absence of any competent Persian authority, to protect isolated British subjects in Shiraz against any possible aggression, which might either be the outcome of the general exasperation resulting from a prolonged faction fight or the desire of some party or individual to save their own life by an act calculated to provoke intervention. Thus the present situation appears to me not only pregnant with unpleasant possibilities but also full of the widest significance. One cannot in Fars ever lose sight of the deplorable results of the disintegration of the Central Government’s authority which has been progressively making itself felt since the commencement of the consti tutional movement, I have, &amp;c. G. G. KNOX. No. 333. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 27.) Sir, Tehran, December 11, 1911. I HAVE the honour to forward to you herewith copy of an able and interesting despatch which I have received from the acting British consul at Shiraz, narrating the closing phase of the acute disorders in Shiraz which marked last summer. At the close of his despatch, Mr. Knox bears testimony to the services of the sowar and sepoy detachments on duty at Shiraz and to the valuable assistance given him by Mr. Smith, Assistant Superintendent of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and by the consulate munshi. I trust that his appreciation of the services of the sowars and sepoys and of the help rendered him by Mr. Smith, may be brought to the notice of the proper quarters, and I take this opportunity, now that Mr. Knox’s charge is drawing to a close, of expressing my own high appreciation of the assistance rendered to me by Mr. Knox during the time he has been in charge of His Majesty’s consulate, the greater part of which was a period of altogether unusual stress and anxiety. His action throughout has merited my entire approval, and his telegrams and despatches contain a valuable record of the complex situation of the past few months, I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 333. Acting Consul Knox to Sir G. Barclay. gi rj Shiraz, October 20, 1911. I HAVE the honour to report that since the date of my despatch of the 7th September, dealing with the general situation in .Fars, events here have moved144 more quickly, culminating at length in the dismissal of Nizam-es-Sultaneh and the termination of Kawam-ul-Mulk’s five months’ “ hast ” in His Majesty’s consulate. The Kasho-ai pickets which had been posted round the consulate, as mentioned in the despatch referred to, were, about the 7th September, considerably increased, and became most aggressive. Consulate servants were continually molested by them one, whose identity was sufficiently apparent from the badge in his hat, being severely beaten and robbed, whilst others were detained for some hours—and those of the Telegraph Department and of other European residents in the same quarter were submitted to similar annoyances. At this time I made an energetic protest to Nizam- es-Sultaneh regarding the molestation of servants, and two days later the pickets were withdrawn, apparently under instructions from Tehran. A claim, however, for compensation for the assault, which was laid at the same time, has been completely cl i s r 0 &amp; i* d 0 d • Meanwhile, on the afternoon of the 7 th September, a considerable number of Arab and Baharlu tribesmen had arrived near Shiraz and, after sharp fighting with the Governor-General’s Kashgai force, entered the town under the command of nine of their more influential chiefs, who wrote to the consular corps notifying that they were come to avenge the murder of Nasr-ed-Dowleh, and had demanded from the Central Government Ibe surrender of Nizam-es-Sultaneh and other intriguers. They added that if they were obliged to take violent measures to secure this object they would, in that event, ensure the protection of the lives and property of Europeans, provided that all the nationals of each consulate or consular agency were assembled in a single spot. I replied, in conformity with your instructions, that the chiefs must pi event any looting of British houses, and that it was out of tne question to entertain their proposal that British subjects should be collected together. Skirmishes in the immediate neighbourhood of Shiraz were of frequent occurrence until, on the 13th September, Nizam-es-Sultaneh sent out to various positions north of the town all the Government artillery, consisting of four Austrian 75-millirn. mountain guns and two antique muzzle-loaders, which for three days continued to bombard the eastern quarters without any appreciable result. At this time, acting on a suggestion of Colonel Cox that the situation might be relieved it he were to hand over Kawam-ul- Mulk to the Khamseh chiefs, after having first obtained from him a telegram to the Persian Government promising that he would remain with these tribesmen out ^ of striking distance of Shiraz until they should themselves come to some decision regarding Ears affairs, I sounded the Governor-General, under your instructions, as to his view's on the matter. Nizam-es-Suitaneh unhesitatingly expressed the opinion that Kawam while in “ honourable confinement ’’ in His Majesty’s consulate w r as far less dangerous than he would be if at liberty with a large force of wild tribesmen at his back, and°that even if such an undertaking as that proposed were given, it could not be expected to remain binding for any length of time. Shortly after the commencement of the bombardment the Prime Minister had telegraphed the strongest instructions to the local military authorities to prevent any of the Government forces from taking part in the struggle. His orders, however, remained without effect: officers and men of the regular army continuing to serve the guns. During this time an incessant long-range rifle fire was kept up day and night on both sides, and on the 16th September after the bombardment had ceased the two parties came to closer quarters, the Kashgai attempting to rush various points in the town, whence they were on every occasion repelled with considerable loss. The next day, however, a brief lull in the fighting resulted, the local notables having received telegrams from the Persian Government announcing Nizam-es-Sultaneh’s recall to Tehran and the appointment of Bukn-ed-Dowleh in his place, pending whose arrival the deputy governorship was placed in the hands of Mirza Habibullah Khan, the local representative of the Ministry of Finance. At the same time Kawam received from the Prime Minister notification of this step and instructions to give all his support to Mirza Habibullah Khan. Nizam-es-Sultaneh on the first receipt of the news, made it clear that he would again resist dismissal, and left no possible doubt of his intentions by sending out to Soulet-ed-Dowleh, who was then at Beza some 25 miles north of Shiraz, a mountain gun accompanied by a strong escort of sowars. On the same day I saw the secretary of the local revenue office, who told me that Mirza Habibullah Khan was ready to take up the deputy governorship, but not without considerable fear of Soulet's enmity, and, indeed, before twelve hours had elapsed a gang of Kashgai led by one of Soulet’s body servants had broken in Mirza Habibullah Khan’s house, beaten him and carried him off, together with as much of his personal property and official records as they could lay their hands on, He was removed to Beza and subsequently to145 \ kl ^ SUm raone y was extorted from him before he was allowed to aftpr thA r 'T’ W 1C k ^ reac ^^ 011 t ^ ie 19 th October, completely broken in health alter the rough usage he had suffered on the journey. worp pWrf.nT 6 the * S1 ^ iatl ?Mi h 1 ad grown more than ever disquieting. The bazaars were in fpa f . remame S0 Jjdl the end of the struggle, all classes of the inhabitants nanfp nllp Q rI 0f lmn l lne l lt P^ge and the arrival of Soulet only served to redouble a 1 200 K 1 1 Justl ^ ec ^ }&gt;y tlle state °f things prevailing; for, with some 1,200 Kashgai strongly entrenched in the commercial part of the town or encamped 27 m ,Zv27 G ' W1 ^ h ab ° ut 2 ’ 200 Kha ^«eh tribesmen, armed townspeople, ,, a f 61 f esta Phshed m the other quarters, ultimate looting on a very large scale was the first result to be expected. ^ s The one step, to my mind, likely at this point to alleviate, in some degree, the situation was to ensure, if possible, the peaceful withdrawal of the Kashgai from Shiraz since, wi e weakness of Soulet s position fully established, by the evidence of the meagi e o lowing he had been able to raise, it was already very plausibly to be anticipated that tlm Arabs would gain the upper hand, and any effort of theirs to is odge the Kashgai from their posts in the richest quarters of the town could only en in every kind of excess, from which British merchants would inevitably be the first to suffer. i M 2&gt; ie .° Ve i’ ^ a ^ on . e abducting the deputy governor, Soulet-ed-Dowleh lad sufficiently clearly shown himself to be in open revolt against the Persian Govern ment, and his general attitude had given abundant proof that he could be influenced by by nothing short of a direct menace. I therefore ventured to suggest that I should he authorised to warn him that if he did not forthwith remove himself and all his men rom the neighbourhood and leave the Central Government a free hand to restore order m Pars as they saw fit, His Majesty’s Government would take immediate steps to piotect British interests. On the same day I wrote to Soulet that I was instructed by y ou to inform him that his presence and that of his tribesmen in Shiraz only made for disorder, and that should any harm to British lives or property render intervention necessary, the consequences would be visited on his head. After consider able delay, he replied that he had come to Shiraz with the object of restoring order, and that British subjects would be protected, asking me at the same time to make in future any official communication to him through the karguzar. Meanwhile, on Hm 19th September the Prime Minister telegraphed to Kawam, instructing him to do all in his power to put a stop to the intrigues of Nizam-es-Sultaneh, and to publish a notice in the town to this effect. Kawam accordingly, after I had obtained your sanction to his doing so while still in His Majesty’s consulate, sent the text of tbe telegram to his son to be printed and circulated. This was followed by another message m which Samsam-es-Sultaneh enquired whether Kawam felt himself equal to assuming charge of affairs in Pars, and whether Zaigham-ed-Dowleh, if appointed Ilkhani of the Kashgai, could count on the general _ support of the tribes. He added that, if Kawam did not think this arrangement feasible, Farman Parma would be appointed Governor- General. Kawam replied that the Khamseh tribes could be fully relied on, and that the appointment of Zaigham-ed-Dowleh would be welcomed by the Kashgai. He suggested at the same time that the Persian Government should give a warning to Soulet strong enough to ensure his departure. Shortly after this the appointment of Farman Parma was announced. By this step the Persian Government apparently hoped to use the friendship existing between Soulet and Farman Parma to detach the former from Nizam-es-Sultaneh. On the 22 nd September Soulet issued a proclamation, in which he stated that he was about to drive the Arabs out of Shiraz, that he would attack them through the town, and that any householder who declined to afford the Kashgai free passage through his premises would be held fully responsible for the damage which might result to him from their forcible entry. The only attempt made to follow this up was the invasion by Kashgai of an entirely neutral quarter, in which they pillaged and even destroyed a number of houses. Within a few hours they were attacked there by the Arabs and, after a whole day’s serious fighting, driven out with heavy loss. After this the ilkhani, feeling his position weakening, announced to the Persian merchants that he had resigned protection of the Bushire road, wishing apparently by this means to compel the mercantile classes to sue to him again, as so frequently before, for the defence of their interests. On this occasion, however, the plan was not successful; and he finally fell back on the time-honoured expedient of extorting from them by open force telegrams to the central authorities lauding his disinterested services. These messages were imme diately cancelled by others dispatched over the British wire, it being by this time ‘ [503] Lapparent to all that, whatever his wishes might be, boulet was m no position to do anything to safeguard traffic on the road. At the same time he definitely abandoned a previously consistent attitude of consideration for these classes and set to work to extort from them, in one case eyen under the sticks forced contributions which were nominally intended to serve for the maintenance of the tribesmen he had brought with him, according to his own account, to restore order in Shiraz, and who were at the moment actually busy with the indiscriminate pillage of all properties outside the About the same time Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, until recently in charge of His Maiesty’s consulate at Mohammerah, was robbed on his way here by a gang o Kashgai within 12 miles of Shiraz. I had received only the shortest no ice of h,s impending arrival; consequently, on account of the universal disorder prevadnig, all my efforts to procure an escort oi to get into communication with him with a view to stopping his iourney until this should be available were fruitless, and at Pul-i-Fesa he fell m with a number of armed men, who robbed him of all his belong,ngs, dragging him from his horse, tearing his clothes, and generally roughly handling him 1 he tribesmen then detaffied hinfin a village near by for some twenty-tour hours while they continued then interrupted work of pillage, seizing everything they could lay hands on and brutal y ill-treating the peasants. During this time reference was made to Soulet, who eventually ordered that his property should be restored, and himself escorted to the consulate, where he subsequently arrived in safety. &gt; Meanwhile, in Shiraz the situation was growing daily more critical; the attitude of Soulet and his followers was most menacing, several of the leading inhabitants receiving open threats of pillage or violence; severe fighting continued without intermission, and warnings constantly reached me from the most various quarters ol an impending attack on the consulate, of which the Kashgai were talking freely, ft the same time I vas approached with frequent appeals for protection from British subjects, from Bntis rms Manchester and Bombay, on behalf of their native agents, as well as from Peisian subjects of every class, including even the Governor of Bushire who was most anxious as to the safety of his family in Shiraz. The kargnzar, m reply to my apphcatioii for information as to what steps the Persian authorities proposed to take for the protectio of British lives and property, had written to me that the ex-Governor-General declined to associate himself in any way with the administration of the province, that the newly appointed deputy governor (Mirza Habibullah Khan, who had just been abducted) had apparently left Shiraz, and that he himself was unable to deal directly with the tubal chiefs in such a matter. Two days, however, after I had apprised you of his reply, he collected a small number of ragged Persian soldiers and distributed them as guar s to various British subjects. These, after a short-lived attempt to extort an excessive wage from the householders they were supposed to he protecting, left Shiraz, avm § received, they declared, no pay for several months past. In the meantime a distributed flags (or rather such substitutes for these as were locally obtamaD ej to British subjects, and to those accredited agents of British firms who could satis y me that they had goods actually belonging to their principals on the premises. is measure was, however, quite inadequate to the requirements of the situation, since it was sufficiently clear that a horde of tribesmen, many of whom had m all probability never seen a European, would not, when once launched on a general pillage, be c ec e by any considerations of international comity or fear of ultimate reprisals ; ant, m view of the obvious impotence of the local authorities to make even the most e emeu aiy effort to protect the lives and property of foreign subjects, I could see no couise open to us if Soulet-ed-Dowleh could not at once be dislodged by some veiy c ® ar 7 worded warning from His Majesty’s Government, but that some overt measure s ou be taken to protect our interests. &gt; i i During these days the fighting, which had continued uninterruptedly, was mai by the invariable repulse of the Kashgai, and on the 29th^ September a rem oiGeme of some 1,500 Arabs crossed the passes and attacked the rival posts estabiis e on northern side of the town. Having cleared these without meeting with any su _ s ^ resistance, and done great execution among the retreating Kashgai, they en fip r ^ n and joined their companions in the eastern quarters, bringing the total o n es there to more than 3,000. At the same time, seeing that the ultimate ® u ^ ces ® 0 • , Khamseh was now assured (and, indeed, Soulet-ed-Dowleh had then reached e p ^ of sending one of his familiars and other emissaries to treat with K a warn), wr ° • es their chiefs, giving a list of houses occupied by British subjects and of business pre ^ of British firms, and stating that, in the event of need arising, every precau ion mu taken to ensure that these be respected.anmmmmm tbeattti tytkift; aMiicid^ 147 On the 3rd October, when the general panic had still further increased, I wrote to Soulet that I w as instructed to notify him that, unless he immediately removed himself and his men fiom the neighbourhood, you would recommend His Majesty’s Government to take immediate steps to protect our interests. A.t the same time I informed the Khamseh chiefs that, in the event of harm befalling the lives or property of British subjects, you would recommend His Majesty’s Government to take steps to exact full reparation for it. In reply, these chiefs wrote to me enclosing copy of a telegram addressed to them by the Prime Minister, in which they were instructed to remain in Shiraz at the service of the Government, and stating that they would do all in their power to protect Europeans. From Soulet-ed-Dowleh I received no answer; two days later, however, his baggage, together with that of Nizam, left the town under a large escort. Kawam-ul-Mulk about this time gave his signature to a document already signed by Soulet, in which it was principally stipulated that the property looted by either side was to be restored, that both parties should immediately dismiss their forces and recognise the ruling of the Central Government on the question of a Governor-General as final, and that Soulet-ed-Dowleh should continue to protect the Bushire road. Needless to say, none of these conditions were fulfilled, and so small was the importance attached by Kawam to this document that he did not even trouble to keep a duplicate, this piece of by-play being designed by Soulet (as his emissaries clearly explained) to silence the ridicule which his discomfiture would call forth from his family and immediate associates, and, in the case of Kawam, to give proof of his public spirit in coming to an arrangement, on the whole disadvantageous to himself, in the interests of the population of Shiraz. On the same evening Kawam received a telegram from Samsam-es-Sultaneh which announced the impending appointment of Ala-ed-Dowleh as Governor-General and of Zaigham-ed-Dowleh as Ilkhani of the Kashgai. It stated at the same time that Ala-ed-Dowleh would not accept the post unless he had full assurances of Kawam’s co-operation. Kawam, when discussing the question, told me that he could not reply satisfactorily until he had obtained a joint oath from all the Khamseh chiefs that they would give unreserved assistance to the proposed combination and a promise from me that, as deputy governor, he would receive the support of His Majesty’s Government. I subsequently answered, as instructed, that if officially appointed deputy governor he could count on our sympathy and support. On the following day Nizam and Soulet left Shiraz and camped for the night some 6 miles away, the latter declaring publicly that he would raise such disorders on the Bushire road as had not before been seen. No doubt his departure may in part be ascribed to the effect of our warning, but in all probability it was rather inspired by more immediate considerations, such as the fact that his small following were already deserting him in large numbers, and that if he wished to maintain any hold over the tribes, who were then well on their way to their winter quarters, he must follow after them before sedition, already well advanced, had time to spread too widely. On the same evening the Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior telegraphed to Kawam, giving him full powers as deputy governor and announcing that 50,000 tomans were being placed to his credit at the Imperial Bank of Persia to serve for the upkeep of a force of Khamseh tribesmen until the arrival of the Governor-General. Kawam, however, was very loath to take up office, and had repeatedly explained to me that no semblance of good order could be maintained without the strongest measures against the sources of intrigue, and that, if he were to take these, it would universally be believed that they were inspired by motives of personal revenge ; he had consequently telegraphed to the Persian Government before receipt of these telegrams, urging them to appoint Mudabber-es-Sultaneh, who, though himself a Shirazi, had maintained for the past few months a consistently neutral attitude, and who, being a complete political nonentity, could serve as a suitable mask for Kawam’s administration of the province. The next day Kawam decided to quit His Majesty’s consulate, and a large crowd of the same townspeople who five months previously had been crying for his blood assembled outside to welcome him. These were shortly joined by some 2,000 Khamseh tribesmen with all their chiefs, Intizam-ul-Mamalek (now Nasr-ed-Dowleh) and Asad-es-Sultaneh, a former Kashgai Ilkhani. The chiefs then came one by one to do homage to Kawam, kneeling in front of him and kissing his hand and knee, whereupon he addressed them at some length, dwelling particularly on the fact that they had never before been known in their history to be thus assembled together in the service of law and order, and that he hoped that after this experience of their complete success in such a cause they would continue orderly and united. His speech was met with every assurance of loyalty to [503] ' ' 2 rjiwii ii'Pfiii ■■ nrrmiwniT 148 the Government, to himself, and to anyone who might desire it. Kawam then gave orders for the tribesmen to divide into two parties, Ins son and himseli lollowing different routes. This precaution was well justified by the event, for within a few minutes of his quitting the consulate a heavy fire was opened on him trom the sangars of Dehbozoorg, a suburb on the north side of Shiraz, where his old enemy Ah Akbar Khordul, was entrenched with some eighty men. In the course of this fusillade five of the Arabs were killed and about twelve wounded, one of whom was shot within a yard of Kawam. He himself appears to have kept his head, and was at least successful m his efforts to prevent his escort of some 1,500 men from attacking the Dehbozoorg a step which could only have ended in the pillage of the mam bazaar, with which the village directly communicates. The tribesmen finally consoled themselves by driving off 300 or 400 camels which were grazing in the neighbourhood preparatory to loading up a large quantity of merchandise deposited in the local caravanserai. This was almost entirely British-owned, and, as Ali Akbar fully recognised the possibility that its presence might render him immune from attack, I have had consideiable difficulty in assuring its removal from so dangerous a neighbourhood. Of the camels, some have been recovered and restored by Kawam, but nearly 150 are still missing and likely to remain so. Ali Akbar himself has since been allowed to leave m peace to join boulet- ed-Dowleh in Firuzabad. This incident appears to have been very carefully organised, and I have subsequently learned that two other parties of hostile tufangchis were posted near the alternative routes which Kawam might follow from the consulate to his house. On the same day, too, intrigues commenced similar to those of last autumn, which had ended in the pillage of the Jews quarter, and some of the heads of their community came in great trepidation to tell me that a Mussulman woman had been caug it throwing a Koran into a cesspool in their quarter. This they declared had been done at the prompting of Nasr-ul-Mulk. I wrote at once to Kawam that the matter had been brought to my notice, and urged him to take every precaution to prevent any molestation of the non-Mussulman population. _He replied that he had already arrested the woman concerned, and assured me that the incident had fortunately transpired eail)/ enough to prevent its having any unpleasant result. I learn, however, that considerable sums fc of money have reached Nasr-ul-Mulk and Ata-ed-Dowleh, and it seems not unlikely that all the intrigue at present in progress beneath the surface may end m some outburst before the new Governor-General s arrival. j j Meanwhile, the appointment of Ala-ed-Dowleh had been officially announced, and was shortly followed by that of Zaigham-ed-Dowleh (under the title of Sardar Ihtesham) as Ilkhani, and of Soulet-es-Sultaneh as llheggi of the Kashgai. Nizam-es-Sultaneh at the same time moved on from the neighbourhood of Shiraz to his own estates at Khesht, and Soulet-ed-Dowleh, after remaining a week to watch events and do what he could to direct them from near Jirreh has now reached Firuzabad. The tribesmen meantime during their southward migration have been more than ever out of hand, and by the 11th October all telegraphic communication with Bushire was cut oft. The damage done was of an entirely wanton character, large lengths of wire being dragged from t e poles and cut up into small fragments. Four gholams sent out at different times from Shiraz to examine the state of the lines were stripped of everything, including their tools and portable telephones, while still in sight of the town; Soulet-es-Sultaneh, nominally in charge of the passing tribesmen, was either unwilling or unable to provide guards tor working parties, and it was only on the 19th October after ten days’ total interruption that sufficient rough and ready repairs could be executed to allow of one ol the t _ree lines being worked. At the same time the conditions of the roads has been growing worse and worse until they are now quite impracticable. During the past three months several robberies of one or two loads of British goods have occurred on the Bushire road (in one case 4001. worth of opium being carried off), and towards the end of September, in view of the acute situation at Shiraz and the complete obscurity of the immedia e trend of tribal politics, I have followed a course parallel to that of Persian merchan s here, and recommended that our firms in Bushire should be advised to suspen forwardings. On the northern road one large caravan in the space of some ten wee s left for Ispahan by the Serhad route about the 1st September, and arrived there sa e y, but only after very heavy exactions by the Kashgai guards. Since that date, with e tribes quitting the higher country, this route has become impracticable and 16 telegraph road has been so disturbed that upward caravans have^ not ventured to eave Shiraz. This state of things has finally culminated in a formidable robbery on ie northern confines of Fars, which occurred on the 12th October, and in which a cai avail reported to consist of 700 mules bringing a large quantity of British-owned gum anc opium from Ispahan to Shiraz, has been so far as is yet ascertainable totally loote } aband of Kuhgelus.^ At the same time a British lady doctor, Miss Boss, who is an independent practitioner unsupported by any religious or other society, was robbed of everything, beaten, and left to make her way as best she could on foot and without shoes or hat to Abadeh. There she still remains awaiting a safe opportunity to continue her journey to Shiraz, where her prospects of setting up a practice will, I fear, have been gravely interfered with by the loss of her drugs and instruments. A few days later near the same spot a body of 300 Persian soldiers, the last of the “ Pars expeditionary force” to leave Shiraz, unpaid and half-naked, were attacked, losing, according to such reports as reach me, ten killed and twenty wounded. There is to my mind in these two outrages a particular significance of the degree of unrestrained brutality now reached by these tribesmen. In the case of Miss Boss, her profession is one which hitherto has always been an adequate passport in all parts of the country; while Government troops in the past have consistently owed a real inviolability to the pity ing contempt of the well-armed robbers for their abject misery and worthless equipment. Thus, while the condition of Shiraz itself is far from reassuring, and that of the roads more than ever deplorable, the general anarchy throughout the province has reached a degree which it is difficult fully to realise in Tehran. The general disregard of all authority of the Central Government or its representatives, on which I dwelt so strongly in my last report on the situation, has been still further intensified by recent events. Gasaalties during this summer’s fighting in Shiraz amount, according to the most reliable estimates to 460 killed. During July, August, and September, Dr. Woollatt and his assistants treated more than 200 cases of serious gunshot wounds, and some 300 others, which various circumstances made it impossible for them to attend, were brought to their notice. Such losses as these, which, if my memory serves me right, were more than double those of the whole conflict of 1909 in and around Tehran, seem to indicate the presence of a rottenness in Pars too deep for any but the most drastic measures to cure. Another point to which local opinion attaches the greatest importance is that, after the quite ineffectual bombardment of Shiraz, all the superstitious respect accorded even by tribesmen to artillery as the most formidable emblem of a central authority has entirely disappeared. At the same time, owing to the large quantities of grain that have been looted or destroyed in the surrounding districts and the failure of many crops in the higher country on account of the severity of the past winter, there is every probability that famine will shortly make itself felt. Added to this, the financial question is becoming acute;, the 80,000 tomans, frequently stated since last February to have been dispatched by the Central Government for the first year’s expenditure on General Maletta’s gendarmerie, have not yet reached Shiraz ; the sum of 50,000 tomans promised to Kawam-ul-Mulk before his departure from the consulate, for the upkeep of a very' necessary force, has not materialised ; and the few regular troops who have not yet deserted are owed some nine months’ arrears of pay and allowances. After three months of the completest disorder here, which the Persian Government, so far as could be seen locally, have made no effort to check, they have apparently at length decided, but not before other tentative experiments, to dispatch Ala-ed-Dowleh and Zaigham-ed-Dowleh to Pars. Early last June I ventured to express the opinion that such a step would be the most likely to offer some hope of success. At that time there appeared every prospect that this change could be effected without difficulty; the general population, with the one exception of Soulet-ed-Dowleh and his satellites, have long looked on Ala-ed-Dowleh as the one man, in the absence of Zil-es-Sultan, capable of governing Pars. Zaigham-ed-Dowleh was then in Ispahan with the Kashgai tribes near at hand, and, remembering with what alacrity these had flocked to him on Zaffer-es-Sultaneh’s appointment a year previously, one could scarcely doubt that, with nothing more than the nominal support of the Persian Government, he could have won over the tribes and appointed to them such kalantars as he considered suitable. Now, however, it will be a very different matter for him to arrive near the tribes, perhaps as much as two months after the dismissal of Soulet, to find the subordinate posts which should be in his gift already filled—some it may be contrary to his wishes—and bis rival left all this time free to cajole any waverers and prepare for a struggle. Yet, although this action cannot be expected to have the same effect now as before the outbreak of general disorder, there is still reason to hope that it may end at least in the permanent removal of Soulet-ed-Dowleh from the field of Pars politics, a result which I could only look on as an unmixed blessing. During the past eighteen months my predecessor and I have both had every reason to consider Soulet-ed-Dowleh as the chief source of disorder and unrest in Pars and to believe that his egregious greed and vanity form a very real menace, while his repeated assurances of devotion to His Majesty’s Government and solicitude for our trade are utterly hollow. These views, I150 venture to believe, have been amply justified by the events of the past summer, which have gradually culminated in his open revolt against the Central Government, the pillage of the entire district, and the wanton destruction of the telegraph lines by his men. It has been, however, urged, on the other hand, that Soulet is helpful to oui trade and that his removal would open the way to an undesirable expansion of Bakhtiari influence in the direction of Ears and Arabistan. On the first point it seems to me axiomatic that any chieftain exercising the least control over the Kashgai could adequately safeguard the Bushire road (except against the large Boir Ahmedi raids which usually occur in the early winter and which have been no less noticeable under Soulet s regime than before) without the unnecessary diversion of traffic and other political exploitation of his position so freely indulged in by the late ilkhani. It is also noteworthy that of the goods robbed during his period of responsibility an inappreciable proportion have been recovered by him. There is, too, a certain significance in the fact that the only robbery occurring this summer on the Serhad road, which lies entirely through Kashgai country, was the theft of a case of 1,500 tomans belonging to the Imperial Bank of Persia, which took place within a few hundred yards of Soulet s own tent. The genesis of his reputation as the protector of commerce seems to lie in the simple fact that the Kashgai chief, controlling the roads and being in an even better position to interrupt than to protect trade, can by the least threat of a stoppage of traffic exeit a pressure on many of the merchants, which is both financially and politically useful to him. . , . j a i i As regards the question of Soulet’s removal leading to a regime under Ala-ed- Dowleh, Zaigham-ed-Dowleh, and Kawam hostile to Kashgai and pledged to support Bakhtiari interests, I believe from all that I have been able to see of tribal affairs m Pars that the assumption on which such a theory is based, namely, that there exists an innate hostility between the Bakhtiari (represented locally by the Kawamisl and the Kashgai, is unfounded. So far as I can see a certain group of the Bakhtiari khans have undoubtedly a very strong personal enmity to Soulet-ed-Dowleh. This hostility, which is by no means unprovoked, is of apparently recent growth, and it is not surprising that the Bakhtiari, with a reputation to keep up as good constitutionalists, should resent their neighbour’s somewhat windy pretensions to a dictatorship of Far 8 . The absence of any feud between the actual tribes seems to my mind incontrovertibly established by tbe fact that during the past months no appreciable effort was made by the Kashgai from their summer quarters to harry the neighbouring Bakhtiari territory, which one may reasonably suppose had been left to a great extent unprotected, owing to the dispatch of so many fighting men to the north. The differences between the Kawamis and the Kashgai are still more personal, having only come into existence with the appearance of Soulet-ed-Dowleh. Moreover, Kawam himself is on the best of terms with Sbulets three brothers, Zaigham-ed-Dowleh, Soulet-es-Sultaneh, and Ali Khan, Hishmat-es- Sultan, as well as many of the leading khans, such as Mohamed Ali Khan, Kashkuli, and Ahmad Khan, Shishbolooki, and the Kashgai as a whole, have had in general nothing but friendly relations with the Khamseh tribes. It thus, seems to me that with the advent of an ilkhani who had not set all his neighbours by the ears a great degree of general appeasement might well have been expected. Unfortunately, however, with the recent break-up of all authority in Bars, one can no longer have so reasonable a presumption that this result will ensue. The heavy losses suffered during the fighting in Shiraz will in all probability have provoked sufficient blood feuds to exercise the best efforts of the tribes for many years ; at the same time the influence of the Central Government will no longer be sufficient to win a chieftain the obedience o his tribesmen, while the lesser khans, having seen to what extent personal pre dominance may reach, are not likely readily to accept another despot. Thus every indication which I have been able to find in the course of events here during the past six months leads, inevitably I fear, to the conclusion that Persia unaided will not be equal to dealing successfully with a situation so grave as that at present existing in Bars. One cannot easily forget with what blowing of trumpets the Persian Government made, nearly a year ago, their reply to a British announcemen regarding the insecurity of the trade routes in Southern Persia by dispatching IN izam- es-Sultaneh, General Maletta and the “ Bars expeditionary force ” on urgent missions to Shiraz: their Governor-General, after giving up the province to the wearying monotony of rapine, murder, and universal anarchy which it has been my task or the past few months to detail, has now quitted his post, a prescribed fugitive, General Maletta’s gendarmerie, of which not one man has yet been raised owmg to the obstruction of the local authorities, has apparently dropped out c a recollection; the 5,000 troops stationed here last Bebruary have dwindled away,chiefly by desertion, to some 300 ragged units, who still clamour fitfully for nine months arrears of pay ; while of the guns dispatched with the “ expeditionary force,” one has been captured by Baharlu brigands and the rest have discharged their ammunition ineffectually into Shiraz itself. It seems then that all these pre parations have led to no more than the laying waste of the more orderly parts of the province and the exasperation of the remainder. In almost every village through out the fertile plains surrounding Shiraz the crops have been either looted or destroyed, and the only visible traces of the Persian Government’s action are a greater misery than ever with more lawlessness and discontent. So from all that can be seen in Pars at least there is no apparent ground for thinking that the Persian Government have now any more than last year awakened to a sense of their responsibilities, and no manifest reason why a second similar attempt to repair the existing state of things should not end in equally lamentable failure. I venture, in conclusion of this inordinately long despatch, to draw your attention to the excellent services of the sowar and sepoy detachments (of the 25th Cavalry and 79th Carnatic Infantry, respectively) on duty here during the five months of Kawam- ul-Mulk’s “ bast ” in His Majesty’s consulate. Throughout this period exceptional precautions have been called for, and the men have cheerfully and ably carried on a constant guard duty greatly in excess of that laid down by regulations. I should like also to take this opportunity to express my great gratitude to Mr. J. Smith, assistant superintendent of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, both for the valuable help he has given me in matters connected with the tribes, where his twenty years’ experieuce has been of the greatest service to me, and for his ready kindness in relieving me of much work at times of pressure by himself taking the labour of dispatching confidentially many of my messages. I would venture too, to point out the admirable way in which I have been served by the consulate munshi, Mirza Fazlullah Khan, who, though not a permanent Government employe, and nominally only engaged at the consulate for lour hours daily, has willingly sacrificed almost all his free time in order to be at hand whenever I might require him for the urgent Persian work constantly arising during Kawam’s presence here, and has served His Majesty’s Government, under circumstances that have held for him many temptations, with a loyalty which I cannot too highly praise. I have, &amp;c. G. G.
