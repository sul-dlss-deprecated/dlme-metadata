The Greek Orthodox Church and the  Armenian Apostolic Church, for example, both maintain ancient patriarchates in  Jerusalem and both have created renowned libraries in them.</p>  <p>In 1949 Kenneth W. Clark arrived in Jerusalem to begin a  project that would microfilm manuscripts from the great libraries of the Middle  East under the auspices of the Library of Congress and the American Schools of  Oriental research. In Jerusalem, his team examined the Greek Patriarchate&rsquo;s collection  of 2,400 manuscripts in 11 languages and chose 998 to be filmed in their entirety.  From the 4,000 manuscripts then in the custody of the Armenian Patriarchate,  the team chose 32. Finally, the group also prepared under his direction a <em><a href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=gdc3&fileName=scd0001_20120108001chpage.db\">Checklist  of Manuscripts in the Libraries of the Greek and Armenian Patriarchates in  Jerusalem Microfilmed for the Library of Congress (1949-1950)</a></em>, which gave researchers access to both the microfilmed manuscript and the black  and white transparencies of select illuminations in them. The microfilm  collection is in the custody of the Humanities and Social Sciences Division,  where it still may be requested.</p>  <p>Since its appearance, this set and the companion sets from  Mt. Sinai and Mt. Athos have been so widely consulted by scholars around the  globe that the Library has now digitized the microfilms to facilitate their use  by scholars worldwide. At the same time the descriptions of the manuscripts as  found in the <em>Checklist</em> have also been edited and updated.</p>  <p>From the Greek patriarchate, Clark&rsquo;s group also chose 755  illuminations from 998 manuscripts (pages 25-32 of the <em>Checklist</em>) and  from the Armenian Patriarchate, 432 illuminations from 22 manuscripts (pages  41-44 of the <em>Checklist</em>) to be photographed in 4 x 5 inch black and white  format. These have not been digitized at this time but are available to  researchers in the <a href=\"//www.loc.gov/rr/print/\">Prints and Photographs Division</a> of the Library of Congress. </p>  <p>Prints of the illuminations and microfilm reproductions of  the manuscripts may be requested through our <a href=\"//www.loc.gov/duplicationservices/\">Duplication Services.</a> When ordering a microfilm or print copy of a manuscript, provide the series number, then add the manuscript number.</p>  <p><u>Example</u>: Armenian 2563. \"Queen Keran\" Gospels.
