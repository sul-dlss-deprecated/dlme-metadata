Band of varied colors runs around the center of body. Upper part of body beautifully decorated with three large ankh symbols, two of which are flanked by Was Sceptres. Between each of these groups is an elaborate bunch of lotus flowers in red, black, and blue. Neck decorated with conventionalized lotus flowers between red, black and blue banding. Workmanship good; very similar specimens from Tell el-Amarna in Berlin. Possibly this specimen is the one referred to by Wilbour in his letter, as coming from Amarna.\r\nCondition: Large chip in rim; also body extensively chipped. Late in 1939 it was observed that the decorated surface of the jar was lifting from the body and beginning to flake off. In February 1940 the object was given several coats of cellulose acetate which seems to have remedied the fault. Surface now strong.", "medium": "Clay, paint", "dimensions": "17 5/16 x 13 in.
