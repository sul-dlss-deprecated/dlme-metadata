Its purpose being to convey the results of his intelligence gathering mission to the North-Eastern Frontier of Persia.The report largely consists of a narrative detailing Stewart's journey from Tehran to the frontier, which he undertook under the guise of an Armenian horse dealer from Calcutta. The narrative details events that unfolded during the course of his journey, but also includes detailed observations on the landscape and settlements he passes through. This includes general observations on the local economy, fauna, geology, history, and politics. Military matters are also a consideration, and it therefore includes details on Persian armaments, fortifications, garrisons, and how easy an army could be transported through the region.Much discussion is given to raids undertaken against Persia — primarily by the Biluchis and the Turkoman — and efforts by Persian authorities to defend against them. Some attention is therefore given to slave trading in the region, and how recent Russian activities have curbed the opportunities to profit from the practice. It also concerns itself with Russian expansion in the region and the extent that the Persians are willing to assist them.On folio 106 is an extract from the Times (August 1880) concerning the Indian Prince Ram Chunder; Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart claims to have met him during the course of his mission.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Charles Edward Stewart</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Balochs (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Tekke (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Russian Turkmenistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Merv</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Mashhad</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Herāt</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Daragez</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Agriculture</topic></subject><subject><topic>Geology</topic></subject><subject><topic>Geography</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military intelligence</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00006b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00006b#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
