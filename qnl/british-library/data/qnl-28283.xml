I have the honour to forward herewith, in duplicate, the Trade Report of the Bandar Abbas Consulate for the year 1935-1936 ( 22 nd March 1935 to 20 th March 1936) compiled by Major C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E., His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas.Report on the Trade and Commerce of Bandar Abbas District for the year 1 93 5-3 6, 1. TRADE. (a) General conditions .—The imports for the cur rent year show a decrease of over Rials 4,000,000 as compared with those of the preceding year owing to the restrictions and embargo placed on piece- goods, twists and yarns, which are the chief items of imports. The import permit premium was more or less placed on a fixed basis by the Government. The whole transaction was conducted by the National Bank of Iran, which retained a margin of a nett profit of 4| per cent, for themselves, between their buying and selling rate. Except for the few articles which are manufac tured in Iran, almost all the articles including luxuries, like wines and spirits, perfumes and toilet requisites are allowed to be imported. But owing to such high taxation in the form of Customs duty, road tax, and import permit premium, imports have been restricted into this port. The high rate of foreign currencies in Iranian money is favoured by local merchants, specially the exporters. The depression in trade and tight ness of money in the bazar was felt more when the rate of Rupees 100 came down to Rials 394. The old established Hindu Capitalists no longer exist except the Firm of Meghraj Lilaram of Shikar- pur, which is on the verge of closing down their business. The business in town during the summer months was as usual at low ebb, with not only wholesale but also retail dealers due to people migrating up country. tuations and controls, import quotas, licenses and prohibitions and a host of similar devices :— Trade and Industry.

There were no competitors’ products in the market except a quantity of 77 gallons of foreign brands of lubricants. Cotton 'piece-goods. —The imports of cotton piece- goods from Japan and India show a decline of nearly 68 and 53 per cent, respectively as compared with last year. The reason can be attributed (a) to the establishment of textile factories in Iran and (6) to the diminished purchasing power of the people. This commodity forms the chief item of smuggling and it can be said that the inhabitants of small towns and villages on the coast smuggle their re quirements from the opposite Arabian coast. Smuggled goods are even occasionally brought to this port, and reach all towns in Fars, Beyaban and Roudbar. The Sherkat Sahami Qumash at Tehran hold the monopoly for the importation of this item, and are represented by the Banque Mellie at Bandar Abbas. The local wholesale dealers purchase from the latter and sell to retail dealers at a stipulated margin of profit. The bulk of the goods was imported from Japan. Twists and Yarns. —The import into Iran of twists and yarns from foreign countries is prohibited due to the installation of several spinning mills in the country. There is no demand for this commodity in the Bandar Abbas area except a limited quantity for the purpose of making sails for small sailing crafts in Khamir and Dizgan. The Customs revenue suffered heavily during the year owing to Embargo imposed on this item, and the deficit in Customs income was the subject of an enquiry from Tehran, which had to be explained by the local Director. Sugar. —The system of purchasing and retailing introduced last year is still in force. Smuggling has practically ceased as there is a very little margin of profit in ratio to the price of Government sugar. Export. The year under review shows a marked improve ment as compared with that of last year, due to the Government’s activities to increase the export of the country. The total exports for the year amounted to Rials 10,157,090 leaving still a deficit of Rials 5,177,033-25 to be made in order to balance with the imports. The Government succeeded in increasing the export of Red oxide from the mines at Hormuz from 6,600 tons shipped last year to 10.161 tons for this year, an increase of 3,561 tons which is valued at £4 per ton for statistical purposes.3-34. 1934-35. 1935-36. tals.

On the outbreak of Italo-Abyssinian War the price for raisins rose temporarily in Bombay market, which caused the local price to rise from Rials 4-25 to about Rials 10 per Bandar Abbas man (9 Lbs.).- . Owing to the formation of Sherkate Pambeh, Pashm, and Ya Poost in Tehran (The Cotton, Wool, and Skin Company) the export of cotton was prohibited as from 4th Mehr 1314 (27th September 1935). The merchants, however, suc ceeded in shipping their stocks before the date, some took the advantage and bought all ready goods in the market which caused the prices to rise from Rials 8 to Rials 14 per Bandar Abbas man (9 Lbs.). As mentioned in last year’s report, the rules with regard to Export and Import Certificates remained in force. The Government fixed the buying rate at 9 per cent, and selling rate at 13| per cent. The whole transaction was conducted by the National Bank of Iran. The Commerce Department at Tehran with a view to increasing the sale of raw materials in the Far East, sent a representative to India, Japan, and China towards the close of the year to study commerce conditions of those countries. He was also invested with power to negotiate with Foreign Firms and ascertain new channels for Iranian goods. (b) New Items of Trade. —Cheap Japanese crockery, bicycles, gramophone, and electrical goods are no longer in great demand. About 80 cases of such articles are at present lying in the Customs awaiting clearance. The adoption of European hats by men about the middle of the year and the subsequent dis carding of the veil by women towards the close of the year, introduced both kinds of hats and ladies dresses in the market, of which a large quantity were ordered from India, Italy, and Germany. The bulk of the trade having been centered in Tehran, petty traders, who before the trade mono poly law visited Bombay, now frequently go to Tehran for their purchases. (c) New Trade Channels. —A proposition supported by the Governor of Gulf Ports is under consideration to form a Steamship Company for Gulf Service. A sum of Rials 250,000 (£3,125) was subscribed locally in a meeting convened by the Governor on thie 25th February 1936. No further action has since been taken. (d) Growth of Foreign Competition and danger to l British interests resulting therefrom. —The Japanese ' competition which has completely ousted the Russians from the Iranian market still holds the upper hand. The Tautteur agreement entered into between Germany and the Iranian Government on the basis of bartering goods concluded during the year under review is still in its infancy and it remains to be seen how far it will succeed in driving the Japanese out of the Iranian market. (e) The Russians—their trading methods — popularity—success or failure. —During the year under report, there has been no import into this province from Russia except that of loaf-sugar, crystal-sugar, ‘ and matches. (/) Credits offered by Foreign Firms as opposed to those granted by British Firms. —Nothing worthy of comment. (g) Popularity of Foreign goods due to quality, price, and terms of payment, etc. —Owing to the poverty of the country, Japanese piecegoods being of very cheap and attractive designs are still popular in this port. (h) 0}en.ing for British goods. —Owing to the poor purchasing power of the people the British goods though admitted to be far superior to others, cannot 1 occupy a prominent position in the face of cheap Japanese competition. (i) Over Trading. —Nil. (j) Commercial Morality. —The commercial moral ity in the market can be said to be on the decrease. The general depression of trade and the exchange, and trade controls and monopolies are the chief factors. {k) Working of Law Courts in Commercial Cases .— As reported in last year’s report, the Law Courts on the whole are satisfactory, although commercial cases are either settled by arbitration or by the Chamber of Commerce out of Court. 2. FINANCE. (a) Tightness of money—to what extent due to restrictions of credit, exchange, insecurity, extra taxa tion, bad harvest, etc. —The scarcity of money was on the increase. The dealers avoided, as far as possible, sales on credit. Those who have money abroad prefer to keep it there, at. a low premium rather than to bring it into the country, where they are confronted with unsettled conditions of exchange and trade restrictions. For some months there was a currency famine created by the illicit export of silver and a shortage of small notes. There is now practically no silver in active circulation.' Before the arrival of new copper and nickle coins from Tehran, great difficulty was experienced by the people in their daily transactions. Petty shop keepers sometimes refused customers for lack of change. Some of the better-to-do class, who were shrewd enough to hoard good silver coins, when defective and Imperial Bank of Iran currency were being called in from circulation, found a good demand for their silver which they sold at a profit of 10 to 15 per cent. The Bank established limited credits to most of the merchants of sound financial standings. The selling quotations of the National Bank of Iran on London and Bombay during the Iranian year 1314 were as follows :— London. Per £. Rials. Highest . . 99—00 Lowest 52—25 Average 77—15 Bombay. Per Rs. 100. Rials. Highest 760 Lowest 394 Average 559—85 (6) Evidence of private capital unemployed or held abroad. —The- world depression in trade being still far below its level, the articles of prime necessity have been abandoned by the Iranian merchants. Those who held funds abroad are not inclined to utilise these beyond their limited requirements, until conditions improved. (c) Diversion of capital from trade to other purposes or vice versa.—Owing to the good dividends paid by the various Syndicates and Companies to their shareholders, and the existence of various restric tions for private trading, most of the merchants have considered it wise to divert a part of their capital from private trading and invest it in such Sherkats, which receive the full support of the Government for all important branches of commerce. (d) Bankruptcies. —Nil. (e) Competition among local banks. —Nil. 3. TAXATION. (a) and (b). Effect on purchasing power, fair and unfair - mctdence.—Tbe old system of taxation, reported last year, was replaced by a new tax of 3 per cent, on practically all articles^of foodstuff, etc., which is borne by the consumers in towns and cities, in ord^er to help the agriculturists of the country. '• (o)'Interference and obstructions on the part of Tax Oo/fec&lt;ors.'—The collection-of taxes m&gt;villages having been abolished as reported above, no unfair incidence on the part of the tax collectors has been in evidence. 4. MILITARY. (a) and (b) Commandeering of transport, extortion and interference with trade. —No commandeering of animal or wheeled transport was noticed except in the summer when the Military Headquarters moved to and from Ginu Hills for which payment was effected. (c) Effect of conscription. —The effect of conscrip tion is of no importance. The people have gradually got accustomed to it. The only complaint is that the unfits, who, in accordance with the regulations, are exempted from service, are enrolled irrespective of the Law. Conscripts with poor vision or weak constitutions are enlisted for clerical and other work, without undergoing any training, and are exempted from field service. 5. AGRICULTURE. (а) Area under cultivation, more or less. —There has been no rainfall during the year under review. No proper estimate of acreage under cultivation is available. The principal areas for cultivation are situated in the Shamilat, Kishar and Minab districts, where water streams irrigate the cultivated fields. Most of the cultivated lands in the Bandar Abbas district are solely dependent on rainfall. (б) The Harvest. —There has been no harvest whatsoever during the year under report, due to the scarcity of rain. There was a heavy shower in the latter part of the winter, which was of no benefit to cultivation. The district depends entirely on wheat and barley imported from Delum and Khuzistan. (c) Introduction of new crops and new methods and machinery. —No new crops or new methods of culti vation or machinery were introduced. No steps to improve cultivation have been taken by Govern ment as is witnessed in other provinces of the country. (d) Harm done by interference of authorities (of arbitrary prices, land titles, etc.). —-Nil. (e) Irrigation, more or less water. —There is no improvement and the same primitive methods of drawing water from wells by bullocks are still adhered to. In some cases, irrigation is effected by means of “ Jubs (local canals) system by the wealthiest landlords. As reported last year a company was formed and the machinery arrived for the purpose of drilling artesian wells. The arrival of a mechanic to work the machjnery is awaited. (/) Extent to which land hypothecated.—The ques tion of hypothecation of landed properties in Bandar Abbas and Minab districts was more common, due to the general straitened condition of the farmers,n and to the rumour that properties irrigated by streams from river beds would be attached and confiscated by Government as Government property. ’ * • , I • ! • &lt;&lt; 6. OPIUM. Opium is not cultivated in the Bandar Abbas &lt;listrict. The local Malieh Department receive their supplies for addicts from the Malieh Department, Bushire. The current price of bond-rolled opium is 1/60 per misqal (one sixth of an ounce). 7. INDUSTRY. (a) to (d) State of industry generally—New indus tries, lapse of old industries—Government encourage ment. —The Carding and Spinning Mill owned by Mr. Y. L. Khunji, an Iranian merchant to which a reference was made in last year’s report is the only industry of its kind in this area. He has added some more improvements to the Mills since last year. The output of the Mills is said to be about 3,600 Lbs. of yarn and twist per day with a nett profit of about £60 per each day. The Mill works continuously for 24 hours. (e) Electricity. —The same old plant mentioned in last year’s report is still in existence and supplies electric current to town. The Governor has not so far succeeded in forming a company of local mer chants with a view to importing new machinery and improving the electric supply of the town. (/) Demand for foreign machinery. —According to the Customs Statistics the values of machinery and tools imported for Bandar Abbas and the interior during the year under review were :— From Rials. United Kingdom .... 1,080,515 Germany ...... 209,357 United States 9,768 Japan ...... 9,795 India ...... 5,509 Salt mines at Namakdan {Kishm Island). —The concession to work the salt mines of Namakdan was given by the Ministry of Finance to a Company formed in Tehran under the name of “ Sherkate Namak ” (Salt Company) with a capital of Rials 500,000 (£6,250), two-third of which. is subscribed in equal parts by the Agricultural Bank of Iran and Mirza Abdul Mohammad Danishwar of the Irano-Japan Trading Company, Tehran, and one- third by other shareholders. ... . . The Irano-Japan Trading Compafiy tendered for the concession, but as the law of the country pro hibited the lease of mines to foreign enterprise, it is believed that they gave their financial support to the former, who is one of their employees, ,to form this company and he himself becomes the Managing Director of the Company. Danishwar and Mr. Misu Bishu of the Irano-Japan Trading Company arrived from Tehran in December, and were joined by a Japanese Salt Mining Engineer, Mr. Makats Akiyama, who arrived from Bombay to inspect the mines. A consignment of 140 packages of explosives, percussions, and shovels, etc., which is said to be intended for the salt mining project was imported in November 1935 and shipped to Kishm Island. It is believed that the work will be commenced in the autumn of 1315 (1936). 8. COMMUNICATION AND TRANSPORT. &gt; ..5•II &amp;¥ .»kl 1 • : : 3V IjUl.,! } (a) to (e) State of communications, constructions of new roads, upkeep of old. —The Bandar Abbas-Lar Motor Road was declared open about the end of this year by the Director of the Shiraz-Bandar Abbas Route, Aqaye Mehdi Ansari, who also paid a visit to Bandar Abbas by the same route in a touring car. Except for a few trips by touring cars, the road is not used by other kinds of wheeled transport as the condition of the road is said to be far from satisfactory, and even difficult for light cars. Total . 1,314,944 [g) Development of mines, im/ any.— vstem of quarftng the Red Oxide mil -The same old system oi quarRng the Keel Uxide mines at Hormuz is still continued, although the work is carried out by Government. A quantity of 10,161 tons of Red oxide to the value of Rials 2,139,541 was shipped to the following countries during the year :— By British Vessels. Tons. Cette (France) 550 United Kingdom 7,450 India .... 1,150 Japan .... 1 China .... 10 By German Vessels. Hamburg . . 1,000 •••'*, l Total . 10,161 The Khoramshahr-Charbar Coastal Road remains incomplete. Ligah was reached during the year, though similar unsatisfactory complaints are heard about the section between Buehire and Lingah which is passable with great difficulty by light oars. Further improvements have been effected on the Tang-i-Zagh road which connects Bandar Abbas to Kerman and the interior, and has greatly reduced the danger of accidents. In January 1936 it was blocked for three days owing to land-slides caused by heavy rain. (d) Average rette of transport. —Table appended to the report (Appendix II) shows the various Trade Routes, their length in miles, freight, duration of journey and nature of transport available in Bandar Abbas. . - u- . ...10. SHIPPING AND FREIGHT. (e) Effect of motors on animal transport, rates and turnover. —The general depression in trade combined with restrictions imposed by Government had a great effect on both methods of transport. Little animal transport has visited the place and the only demand is for carrying loads to and from Lar and such other places where the road is impassable for motor transport, also to carry such goods to interior that were not in immediate demand there. The motor transport chiefly depended on consignments of Petrol and Kerosine Oil destined for other centres in the interior. (/) Air Service. —Nil. {g) Security. —The trade routes on the whole were well maintained during the year, specially the Bandar Abbas-Kerman route. 9. SOCIAL. (a) Standard of living. —As mentioned in previous years, the standard of living still continues to be low and no steps have been taken towards amelio ration. Appendix III shows the prices of food stuffs prevailing during the year under report. (b) Unemployment. —The existence of a Spinning Mill, the constructional works carried out by Military in building Barracks, and the Municipality in opening avenues and making of roads combined with other casual labour for handling import and export goods cannot be said to have made unemployment un common. (c) Evidence of emigration. —Emigration to opposite Arab coast is insignificant as unemployment com bined with a higher cost of living on the opposite coast renders it impossible. Emigration to the interior, especially to Minab and Shamilat for the date harvest is still popular. (d) Public health and hygiene. —The Charitable Dispensary remained closed throughout the year for lack of funds and a medical officer. The general health of the town is fair. Malaria and diseases of the skin and eyes are most common. Guinneaworm, which is due to drinking rain water from reservoirs called “ Berqahs ” is also very common during the summer. (e) Municipal Service. —The Municipal Committee consists of 6 representatives from the public with the local Governor at its head as Rais-i-Baladieh (President). The work on the stream of fresh water brought from Naibund, two miles from the town, is still in progress, and it is still far from adequate for the town supply. The main road—the so called “ Avenue ”—is still incomplete. Work is occasionally resumed on it when funds are available. (а) Shipping. —Seventy-seven steamers aggre gating 201,241 tons entered the port during the year with cargo. Sixty-five steamers aggregating 164,860 tons cleared the port with cargo. Of these that entered the port, 63 vessels with a tonnage of 132,635 were under the British Flag. Seven vessels with a tonnage of 28,542 were German, six vessels with a tonnage of 34,164 were Japanese and one vessel with a tonnage of 5,900 was Russian. Sixty-five vessels which cleared the port consisted of fifty- one vessels with a tonnage of 96,263 were under the British Flag, seven vessels with a tonnage of 28,542 were German, six vessels with a tonnage of 34,164 were Japanese and one vessel with a tonnage of 5,900 was Russian. The shipping of all nationalities is tabulated in Appendix I. (б) Freights. —The freight charges during the year were as follows :— (1) To London— «. d. Carpets per ton of 40 c.ft. . . . 88 0 Almonds shelled per ton of 10 cwt. . . 55 0 Almonds shelled per ton of 40 c.ft. . . 57 6 Almonds unshelled per ton of 40 c.ft. . 57 6 Almonds unshelled per 8 cwt. . . . 52 6 Pistachio nuts per ton of 40 c.ft. . . 60 0 Gums per ton of 40 c.ft. . . . . 65 0 Gums per 17 cwt. . . . . . 62 6 Raisins per 10 cwt. . . . . 75 0 Raisins per 40 c.ft. . . . . 80 0 (2) To Bombay— Rs. a.

MGIPC—M—VI-30—7 -11-36—32.Report on the Trade and Commerce of the District for the year 1934-35. Bandar Abbas 1. Trade. (a) General conditions .—The imports have consi derably decreased, specially owing to the embargo placed on piece goods, twists and yarn, which are the chief items of imports. No sooner than the embargo was declared about July 1934 the premium on import permits for these commodities went up by leaps and bounds. Just a few days before this the import permit premium on piece goods was about 8 per cent and immediately it went up to 30 per cent in less than a week. Later on it went up as far as 50 per cent. Also a brisk buying up of the stocks already lying in the bazaar began almost immediately by certain capitalist Iranian Firms. This, however, did give a temporary relief to those merchants who have been losing heavily on piece goods. During the whole year, owing to constant fluctuations in the price of export certificates, the piece goods market remained very unsteady. The sole importing rights for piece goods have been given by the Government to the Iran Trading Company, Limited. No import permits for this commodity are now given to individual merchants. So far no piece goods have been imported into Bandar Abbas by this Company, but it is lately noticed that the principal piece goods merchants of Bandar Abbas have been advised by the responsible parties to form a Company which should purchase piece goods from the Iran Trading Company for the entire Bandar Abbas market. In short the Bandar Abbas Com pany would have to work as the sole selling agents for the Iran Trading Company. No definite steps have yet been taken here in this connection. Except for the few articles which are manufactured in Iran, almost all the articles including luxuries like wines and spirits, certain tinned provisions, perfumes and toilet articles are allowed to be imported against the purchase of Government dollars ranging from ten to hundred per cent. But owing to such high taxation in the form of Customs duty, road tax and import permit premium, import of these articles have been restricted into this port. The high rate of foreign currencies in Iranian money is favoured by local merchants, specially those who deal chiefly in Iranian products for export. The depression in trade and tightness of money in the bazaar was felt more when the rate of Rupees 100 came down to Rials 450*50 towards the close of the year. Old established Hindu merchants, who locked up much capital in goods and credits, are out of existence and giving place to dealers who buy and live from hand to mouth and have small expenses. The business in town during the summer months was at low ebb, with not only wholesale but also retail dealers, due to people migrating up-country. The total volume of trade of the district, which for customs purposes, comprises Bandar Abbas, Charbar, Jask, Khamir, Kishm and Tiab (Port of Minab) aggregated Rials 24,827,671 as against Rials 37,364,626 for the previous year, showing a decrease of Rials 12,536,955. The following table will give an idea how the trade in Bandar Abbas district has gradually dwindled on account of high tariffs, exchange controls, import quotas, licences and prohibitions and a host of similar devices :— Trade and Industry.

Colton Puce Goods.-lt is more remarkable, com-, pared with a year ago, that the proportion of i mports ! about fin P,e “ g f ood8 .f ron ; India shows a decline of about 60 per cent while the arrivals from Japan in- creased by 17 per cent. 1 Twists and Yarn.—As compared with last year J R al^n 7(¥&gt;°fiZT t8 T) ari f yam fr ° m India feI1 f ' om 1 Rials 11,700,644 to Rials 3,561,834, a decrease of Ria s 3 74M06 7 U 16 * imp(&gt;rt8 dro PPed from Rials 3,741,106 to Rials 1,769,461. Despite Japan’s keen competition, India is holding a predominant position in twists and yarn. predominant Sugar.—The sugar market also passed through various phases throughout the year under repoft. For a short time the merchants who had secured import permits by first purchasing from Government the equivalent quantity, made good way towards profiteering business, but this was only for the time &gt;emg, and as no more permits were granted, the whole situation took its original turn and the mer chants were to satisfy themselves by only purchasing from the Customs and retailing same in the market” fnTnnt 0n fb Were im P osed ^ the purchases and only those merchants who could produce a certificate from the local Chamber of Commerce testifying that the said merchants had been dealing in sugar before 1930, were allowed to purchase from Government the quantity allowed to him by the Chamber of Commerce. Precautions against smug gling in the shape of applying band role to the loaf Ty-’ C M ne a k d tea P ackets and Plumb seals to one b v X U n ^ ° f + Cr S aI 8Ugar ’ was introduced by the Government. This too not being found effective the Minister of Finance, during his short sojourn here in February 1935, reduced the price of loaf sugar and crystal sugar for Bandar Abbas and surrounding districts up to a radius of 16 farsang (about 48 miles) from the Iranian coast, to Rial? 8-15 and 9-15 per batman, respectively, so that the S ShT b y ndUCed t0 bu y the smuggled stuff. This did produce a good effect, as the smug glers, to dispose of their stock quicker, reduced the Rial? ° f ^ 0 “ traband su g a L namely loaf sugar from 15 Q r, r ^ and Crystal su g ar ^om Rials 15 to 9 per Tabriz Man. The sole right of selling loaf sugar, crystal sugar and matches in BandafAbbas has been given to a Company formed of local merchants who have been dealing in these commo dities before the year 1930. The retail dealers in the bazaar are supplied with the stock by this Com- ^_pany to be retailed at the rates fixed by Government. Export .—year under report is the worst on records. The total exports for the year amounted to Rials 5,•139,155 as against Rials 7,422,508 of the previous year, showing a decrease of Rials 1,983,353.

Owing to the recent rise in the silver prices, the exporters had to face a very difficult problem which arose through the appreciation of the currency of Iran, but thanks to the immediate intervention of the Minister of Finance, the chaos was avoided. Government immediately raised the value of export certificates from 9 per cent to 25 per cent. Up to recently, according to the last year’s new regulations, the exporters had to sell their export certificates only to Government at 9 per cent and the importers had to buy from Government at 131 per cent, but at the end of the year under review tne rate has gone up, t,e., selling 25 per cent and buying 30 per cent. It is reported that to increase her sales abroad of the raw materials and foodstuffs, Government encouraged agriculture and marketing. But it depends upon the extent to which other countries are willing and able to accept Iran’s products. (6) New Items of Trade.^Chea.p Japanese goods such as cement, bicycles, electric bulbs, gramo phones, chinaware and porcelainware, viz., bowls, cups, saucers, plates, jugs, dishes, teapots and such articles suited for table use, remained very promi nent. (c) New Trade Channels. —Nil. (d) Growth of foreign competition and danger to British interests resulting therefrom .—By the entry of Japan into the Iranian market, the Russians, who were a menance to the British interests, have been completely ousted, chiefly in cotton piecegoods and yarn. (e) The Russians—their trading methods — popul arity, success or failure .—No Russian articles were imported during the year, except matches. (/) Credits offered by foreign firms as opposed to those granted by British Firms .—Owing to the control of foreign exchange and frequent introduction of new rules and regulations by the Iranian Government no credits are being oSered by foreign firms.. (g) Popularity of foreign goods due to quality, price and terms of payment, «&lt;e.—Owing to the poverty of the country, Japanese piecegoods and porcelainware, being of very cheap and of attractive designs, are appreciated in this part.{h) Opening for British Goods .—As mentioned in last year’s report, the British certainly cannot occupy a prominent position in the face of Kussian and Japanese competition. On the other hand control of exchange and import restrictions render business difficult now a days. (*) Over-trading. —Nil. 0) Commercial morality .—Commercial morality in the market has deteriorated considerably due to depression of trade in general and control of foreign exchange in particular. (£) Working of law courts in commercial cases .— As reported in last year’s report, the Law Courts on the whole are satisfactory, although commercial cases are dragged on until arbitration comes to their rescue. 2. Finance. {a) Tightness of money—to what extent due to res trictions of credit, exchange, insecurity, extra taxation, bad harvest, etc .—During the year under report gradual scarcity of money was experienced in the whole market, and since the beginning of the year 1934, it was much worse. There is no money in the whole market, transactions are very few and it takes a long time to recover money for goods sold to even reliable parties. The silver coins have become so scarce in the bazaar that at times it is impossible to get change for even a fifty Rials note ; of course notes of five rials to hundred rials are abundant. Owing to the tightness of money and general depression in business, credit facilities granted by merchants to small retailers has been greatly restricted and a merchant prefers now a days to sell his goods at a considerably lower price for cash than what he would get if he were to sell as usual for credit. The Bank also requires substantial guarantee, sometimes, even ourtimes the value of the credit required, and even then is very reluctant in granting credit. The selling quotations of the National Bank of Iran on London and Bombay during the Iranian year 1913 were as follows :—■ London— Highest Rials . Lowest . Average . , Per £ 82-50 66-00 78-00 Bombay— Highest Rials . Lowest . Average . Per hundred rupees. 620-00 499-00 580-00 (6) Evidence of private capital unemployed or held abroad. Hard hit by the world depression the foreign trade touched a point far below the level, and conse quently the Iranian merchants shut of! the importa tion of many articles of prime necessity. Under the circumstances the merchants who held funds 4 abroad are not inclined to utilise these until condi tions improve. (c) Diversion of capital from trade to other purposes or vice versa.—Nil. (d) Bankruptcies. —Nil. (e) Competition among local Banks. —Nil. M (f) Importation of silver .—In April 1934, some 900 bars of silver were landed at Bandar Abbas from England in transit to India via Kerman and Zahidan, most of the consignment being handled by the local branch of the National Bank of Iran. In May last the Ittefaqheyeh &amp; Co. received a telegram from Bombay that the Government of India had put a stop to the importation of silver in transit from England via Zahidan. This caused much embar rassment and the dealers, including the National Bank of Iran, were holding up their consignments of about 1,500 bars. They were eventually obliged to ship to Bombay by British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamers. 3. Taxation. (a) and (6) Effect on purchasing power, fair and unfair incidence .—When the Minister of Finance visited Bandar Abbas in February 193'5, he amal gamated the Revenue Department with the Customs Department and transferred the office there. This amalgamation is a blessing to the poor as the extor tion of money by this department now ends. The old system of taxation, viz., in some cases three per cent of the crop and in other the tax on water supplied during every 12 hours, was abolished by the Minister of Finance in the latter part of the year, solely to help and save the cultivators from being harassed by the tax collectors, and to en courage agriculture in the country. Instead of this it is reported that the Ministry intends introducing from the beginning of next year a tax which will be borne by the consumers only. (c) Interference and obstructions on the part of tax collectors .—No interference of importance was brought to notice, but the farmers cannot be said to have been totally spared by the tax collectors. The abolition of tax collecting from the cultivators is a blessing to them although at the expense of the con sumers, who are sure to pay much more when the new system is introduced. 4. Military. (a) and (6) Commandeering of transport, extortion and interference with trade and industry .—Only in summer when the Military headquarters are moved to Ganow hill, were both animal and wheeled trans ports commandeered, but their interference with trade or extortion was not observed. ( c ) Effect of conscription .—The people can be said to be gradually getting accustomed to it and the immigration on this account was not of importanceduring the year. The Governor has to be credited for this, who while going through the individual cases, enlisted only those whose age, circumstances and physique allowed, though the Census Depart ment, to show some result enlisted persons with defective eyes and over forty years of age. 5. Agriculture. (a) Area under cultivation, more or less. —Except for heavy showers in places the rainfall was generally light to moderate. No proper estimate of acreage under cultivation is available, as it chiefly depends upon the winter rain and varies every year according to the financial position of the farmers. The prin cipal areas are situated in the Shamil, Minab and Kishar districts. (b) The Harvest. —The harvest in general was good, but the commodity prices were not high enough to reap good profit. The principal produce of the Bandar Abbas district is wheat, barley and millet. The latter is grown in small quantity and is chiefly consumed by the villagers. The crop never lasts for more than 6 months and as it is of inferior quality it is not fit for town consumption. The villagers always depend on Bandar Abbas for the rest of the year, where wheat and barley from Delum (Bushire district) is imported. (c) Introduction of new crops and new methods and machinery. —Neither new crops nor new method of cultivation were introduced. Agricultural machinery has not been introduced in this part as the labour is cheap and the area cul tivated is not so extensive as to necessitate the use of machinery. {d) Harm done by interference of authorities {of arbitrary prices, land titles, etc.). —Nil. [e) Irrigation, more or less water. —There is no improvement and the same primitive methods (i.e., drawing water from wells by bullocks) were em- ployed - In some cases irrigation is effected by means of “ jub ” (local canal) system by the wealthiest land lords. The local merchants are discussing a project for the formation of a Company, with a capital of Rials 120,000, to import machinery for the purpose of drilling artesian wells in Bandar Abbas and in the neighbouring villages for cultivation (/) Extent to which land hypothecated. —Most of cultivated lands in the Shamilat and Minab areas is hypothecated and in the hands of wealthy landlords at Bandar Abbas and Minab. 6. Opium. Opium is not cultivated in Bandar Abbas district. The supply for addicts is received from Bushire Malieh Department. The rate of opium per misqal (one sixth of an ounce) was Rials l-20 which was raised to Rials 1*50 after the visit of the Minister of Finance in February last. 7. Industry. (a) to {d) State of industry generally, new industries, lapse of old industries, Government encouragement .— There is no other industry in Bandar Abbas, except a carding and spinning mill owned by Mr. Y. L. Khonji, an Iranian merchant, who was trading in Bahrain and Bombay. A second hand mill was bought by him in Bombay in 1934, and installed in the village called “ Khojita ”, a distance of one mile from the town. To erect this mill 8 Indian mill hands were imported from Bombay. In December 1934, Mr. Thomas Bryant, Electric Engineer of Crupp Indian Trading Co., Ltd., Bombay, brought a Diesel engine and started the mill working on the 1st January 1935. The Indian Spinners instructed Mr. Khonji to import 30 qr 40 Indian labourers to start the w'ork, but-, under instructions from the local Governor, he refused to bring Indians and compelled them to teach the Iranians. It is reported that 2 bales of (200 lbs. each) cotton is used every day of which a net loss of 120 lbs. (30 per cent) per day is estimated for want of skilled labourers. As Mr. Khonji was losing heavily by employing unskilled Iranians, one man was sent to Bombay to engage 30 Indians, and Mr. H. W. Brown, a Spinning Master from Manchester, was engaged, notwithstanding the pressure brought on Mr. Khonji to engage only Iranians. The skilled labour is so short as to be practically non-existent, and the climate and condition of Bandar Abbas tend to devitalise foreign skilled workers after a year or two. Of the 8 Indian spinners mentioned above, one Spinning Master and one Mechanic returned to India on the recommendation of the Iranian Military Medical Officer. As the terms of their contract were not completed they were refused free passage with food and pay for the period they were sick. But, thanks to the Medical Officer, who compelled the owner of the mill to pay them all their dues, as they were returned to India on medical grounds. The Indian spinners were eventually paid all concessions due to them. (e) Electricity. —There is an electric plant in the town which was imported 10 years ago from England. As the lights are fixed at great distances the lights are very feeble and dim. A certain Iranian mer chant has now undertaken to form a Company for the electrification of the town and to import large size dynamo. (/) Demand for foreign machinery. —According to the Customs Statistics the value of machinery and tools imported for the Interior during the year under report were:— Rials. From Germany „ U.

(al to (cl State of communications, constructions of new roads, upkeep of old.-Vo new roads have been constructed during the year. _ The, construction of Mohammerah-Charbar road is still in abeyance, except the Bashire^ Lingah section which it is hoped to be completed early next year. . m . The road authorities started widening the lang-i- Zaeh on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman motor road in November 1934, and due to constant land slides the wheeled traffic and mail service on this road were very irregular, and some times mads were transhipped at the Tang with great difficulty by means of camels and donkeys. j j (d) Average rate of transport.—Table appended to this Report (Appendix II) shows the various trade routes, their length in miles, freights, duration of journeys and the nature of transport available in Bandar Abbas. . , j (e) Effect of motors on animal transport, rates and turn-over. —The year owing to Government restric tions has been dull for both methods of transports specially for the animal, which had to wait here “ausport Which now-a-dayc chiefly work between places where proper roads do not exist.

H. Dumree, Medical Officer findinv his pay inadequate without practice and paucity of sfafi, resigned the post and took up an appointment as Medical Officer under the Koad Administration in Mazenderan. -Randar When the Minister of Finance visitc Abbas in February 1935, he found the town in Buch a miserable and filthy condition a 9 ^he * 6 were ixo funds in the Municipality to sweepers He ordered that a sum of Rials 130,000 standing to the credit of the Municipality for soine years in the customs be placed at the dls P 0Sd - the Municipal Board for the improvement of the town and medicines for the dispensary. _ M , • The general health of the town is fair Malaria and diseases of the skin and eyes are most common. During summer months the disease of u ’ due to drinking water from reservoirs, called Bar- oahs ” is also very common. . . , ... q (e) Municipal Service.-IU Municipal consists of 6 representatives from the public with the local Governor at its head as Rais-i-Baladiyeh ^Thfwolk of the abandoned qanat (underground water channel) was resumed in ^ ovem u r » and a small stream of fresh water now ^ up to the middle of the town. As water flo ^ s throUg o{ unoemented trenches from Naiband, a is ,, a . 2 miles, it is a bit brackish, but it is hoped that when the permanent stream of water flows the clay will radicate the trenches and the waterJ &lt;S) 5 quite fit for drinking purposes. If this turns out a success, it will be a real blessing for the public and will serve to eradicate the scourage of guineaworm from the district. The main road—the so-called V Avenue ’’—has been partly completed, the work having been aban doned for lack of funds, but the financial suppbrt granted by the Minister of Finance in February 1935, has caused resumption of work, and a great improvement rendered feasible by one of the clear ance schemes, which will materially change the centre part of the town. The demolition of a number of small and undesirable houses in the town will permit the construction of cross roads. Much of che property affected belongs to the poor, some of whom were compensated, and some allotted plots of ground in other quarters. Another Company of some merchants has been formed as a housing society to build flats on either side of the main road for Government servants. The Government under taking to lease the same for long periods. 10. Shipping and Freight. (u) Shipping. —Sixty-six steamers aggregating 148,811 tons entered the port during the year with cargo and 3 vessels of Bombay Iranian Steam Navi gation Co., Ltd., without cargo, which is recorded as arriving in ballast.

Of these, 64 vessels with a total tonnage of 128,424 were under British fkig and 5 vessels with a total tonnage of 20,387 of the German Hansa Line. No Soviet Mercantile Fleet entered this port during the year under report. S. S. Haidan and Flood of the Bombay Iranian Steam Navigation Co., Ltd., called at Bandar Abbas after a lapse of several years to resume competition with the weekly B. I. Steam ships in the Persian Gulf.

I have the honour to forward, herewith, in duplicate the Trade Report of the Bandar Abbas Consulate for the year 1932-33 ( 22 nd March 1932 to 20 th March 1933), compiled by Captain C. H. Lincoln, O.B.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas. HPmm Report on the Trade and Commerce of the Bandar Abbas District for the year 1932-33. 1. Trade. (a) General conditions .—Trade of Bandar Abbas during the year under review was, as in the past years, very limited and the merchants here, who in the majority of cases are closely connected with business firms in Kerman and Yezd, have been acting as agents for clearing and forwarding goods up country. The import was restricted owing to adverse exchange and export invariably brought loss, were it not for the premium at which export certificates were sold. The monopoly of sugar and matches being reserved by the Persian Government, the con signments of these commodities w T ere stored in the newly built godowns at Bandar Abbas and sold to the merchants who then forward these up country to Kerman and Yezd. It is usual for the principal merchants to proceed to the neighbouring hill stations and elsewhere in the interior during summer months and this often slackens trade for 3 months. Since the introduction of the Foreign Trade Monopoly Law and increased taxation, the Hindu merchants, who were in the past doing business extensively in Persia (specially in Kerman and Bandar Abbas), were hard hit and had to face diffi culties. Of the two Hindu firms that existed last year, one was closed down in the beginning of the year. The remaining one is also contemplating clos ing down as soon as outstanding amounts are realised. The total volume of trade of the district, which, for Customs purposes, comprises Bandar Abbas, Charbar, Jask, Khamir, Kishm and Tiab (Port of Minab) aggregated Rials 46,467,700, as against Rials. 27,934,349 for the previous year, showing an increase of .RiaZs. 18,533,351. Imports .—The imports amounted to Rials. 37,521,200 being more by Rials 17,753,743 than the previous year. The values of the principal articles of imports were :— (1) Cotton piece-goods from— Rials. Russia .... 3,051,238 Japan ..... . 2,464,933 India ..... . 2,070,304 United Kingdom . 337,670 7,924,145 (2) Twists and yarns from—. Japan ...... India ...... Russia ..... China ...... United Kingdom .... Rials. 12,176,566 8,658,000 104,100 39,400 16,600 1 20,994,666 (3) A. Sugar (Loaf and cube) from—• Russia ..... India ..... 2,345,642 141,000 2,486,642 B. Sugar (Crystal) from— Russia ..... Java ..... 1,533,650 124,000 1,657,650 (4) Tea from—■ India ..... China ...... Java ...... 491,682 54,000 7,640 553,322 (5) Matches from— Russia ..... 39,700 From the above details, it will be observed that Russia has played a prominent part in the cotton piece-goods. It is believed that in the coming year Japan will oust Russian piece-goods from the Persian market, as, it is reported, the Japan piece-goods are cheaper and better in quality and therefore gain favour in this country. The import of Manchester goods has practically ceased, but it cannot be said that there is no demand, as the piece-goods imported through India are mostly Manchester products. As regards twists and yarns, Japan has captured the market and it is believed that in the next year the market will be flooded with these commodities. As the monopoly of the importation of sugar was solely given by the Persian Government to Russia during the year, no other country has imported this commodity. The figures shown under India and Java were imported last year before the monopoly was given to Russia and cleared from the Customs during the year under report.2 Exports .—The total exports for the year amounted to Rials, 8,946,500 as against Rials 8,166,892 of the previous year, showing an increase of Rials 779,608. The principal articles exported during the year were:— (1) Carpets to— Rials. United Kingdom . 778,000 India ..... 683,298 Germany 520,000 United States of America 470,000 Oman . . ... 91,380 Aden . 29,200 Iraq A _ 26,900 Kuwait .... 7,700 Bahrain .... 3,400 2,609,878 (2) Cotton (Raw) to— India ...... Oman . - . . . . . 1,666,300 13,270 1,679,570 (3) Raisins and other dried fruits to— India ...... — Oman . Bahrain . . . . . 456,490 25,100 2,400 483,990 (4) Dates to— . • , Oman ..... India ..... 140,070 103,300 252,370 (5) Pistachio nuts to— India . ... 368,300 U. S. A. 75,400 Iraq .... 10,600 444,300 (6 Almonds to — India .... . . 395,836 United Kingdom . . 93,000 Oman .... 475 489,311 ( 6 ) New items of trade .—The new entry in the market was of the Japanese piece-goods and twists and yarn against which the Russians had to face serious competition, the quality of the Japanese piece-goods being preferred by the local merchants on account of their good quality and cheapness and they therefore find a ready market. J . (c) New Trade channels .—The Sharq Company advertised the acceptance, at low rates, by steamers of the Soviet Mercantile Fleet, of cargo including Red Oxide of iron ore, for ports abroad, but, owing to the irregular and unreliable service, failed to secure freights. Export of dry fish to Europe increased during the year. {d) Growth of Foreign competition and dang&amp;^p British interests resulting therefrom .—The chief SR- petitor in the Persian market is Russia, 'who conti nues steadily to strengthen her position, but, owing to their unfair dealings with the local merchants, their trade menace seems to be for the present doomed, and it seems that Japan may enter to fill up the gap. The total value of her imports during the year amounted to Rials 7,074,330. Her share in the piece-goods trade, in which she specialises, j was Rials 3,051,238, out of a total of Rials 7,924,145. i The greater part of the general imports from abroad 1 came from the United Kingdom and India. In regard to sugar, Russia holds a predominant position, as she was given monopoly to import. (e) The Russian—Their trading methods — Po pularity—Success or failure .—The granting to the Russians by the Persian Government under the Trading agreement of a monopoly of certain goods, notably sugar, matches and oil gives that country an advantage ever any other in the Persian trade. The sugar which was solely supplied by the Russians, was very inferior in quality and much disliked by the consumers. The people in general are now opposed to Russian imports and conse quently “ Vaneshtorg ” had to close their activities in several places. The Russians remained, as before, unpopular in the market and it is generally beleived that they are supplying goods much inferior to that agreed upon. When 200 cases of matches were landed for the Persian Government, the Customs Depart ment found that each box, supposed to contain 65 matches according to the contract, actually had 52 matches. (/) Credits offered by Foreign firms as opposed to those offered by British firms .-.—No credits are now offered by foreign firms it being found very risky owing to the introduction of the control of foreign exchange by the Persian Government. {g) Popularity of foreign goods due to quality, price, t terms of payment, etc .—Import of Manchester piece- goods has much decreased while the Japanese piece- goods and twists are now coming in large quantities. (K) Openings for British goods.—On account of dearness and restrictions on several articles, British goods are not now imported as before. (*)&gt; Over-trading. —Nil.(j) Commercial morality. —Good. (k) Working of law courts in commercial cases .— The town of Bandar Abbas with its vast district was without a judicial court, after the closing down of the Sulhieh' Court in September 1930, until the 26th September 1932, when it was superseded by a Bedayat Court, consisting of a Raise, a Modai-ul- OjgmQm and a. Mosiantiq. A reception was held by th. liaise to inaugurate the opening of the first proper Adlieh Court at Bandar Abbas. During the term, the Court was chiefly busy in studying and arranging the various old pending cases, and except a few cases of smuggling in which the Customs were concerned, ho important cases can be said to have been decided by the Court. This does not apply to a few compromised civil cases. 2. Finance. (a) Tightness of money—to what extent due to restriction of credit, exchange, insecurity, extra taxa tion, ete.—The selling quotations of the Banks on London and Bombay were as follows :— 1 London— Highest . ,&gt; r ' u ‘ . Rials. 110 to £1. Lowest . • • *91 78 „ £1 Average . 98 „ £1 Bombay— Highest . 9 • *99 834 „ Rs. 100 Lowest . 689 „ Rs. 100 Average . • • * 99 ‘ 739 „ Rs. 100 Owing to the nature of Bandar Abbas Commerce, money may always be said to be tight, in the sense that money is always in demand. The local mer chants are engaged largely in clearing goods from the Customs and forwarding them up-country^ for which purpose money is required for payment of customs duties and taxes. The appreciably in creased customs duties caused an increased demand for money. Under the Government Trade Monopoly Law, which governs the import and export of merchandise, the relative Foreign Exchange has tu go through, the hand of the two Agent Banks of the Govern ment, i.e., The National Bank of Persia and the Imperial Bank of Persia. This class of business entails a great deal of extra work and trouble and they do not feel cbmpensated by the small profit made on Exporters^ Exchange. During the year- the market in Free Exchange was very dull, the majority of the business offering being on India. (fc) Evidence of .yr{vote capital unemployed or held ohroad.—'Tfiere wan great inducement to import foreign capital into, the country on account of de preciation in! Persian currency and great disparity between the Government rate of exchange and the free rate in the bazaar but still owing to the ever changing rules and regulations, it was thought risky to introduce new capital into the country. (c) Diversion of capital from trade to other purposes or vice-versa. —Nil. (d) Bankruptcies. —Nil. ' (e) Competition among local Banks. —The National Bank have now been operating in Bandar Abbas for two and a half years. The competition between the two Banks (Imperial Bank of Persia and the National Bank of Persia) has been very keen result ing in finer margins in the rates and freer credit facilities granted to the merchants. A great part of their business appears to consist of operations in Exporters’ Exchange and it seems that this class of business gives them a great deal of trouble and that the local staff is not adequate enough to cope with it. The withdrawal of the Imperial Bank of Persia Note issue is now near completion and only a small percentage of the notes are still in cir culation. Very few of the new National Bank of Persia Notes are m use locally and none of the new silver Rials have been issued. 3. Taxation. (o) Effect on purchasing power. —Increased tax ation under the guise of monopoly tax, surtax, road tax, heavy demurrage on goods lying in the Customs, have also tended towards the increase in prices of commodities and the purchasing power of the public has consequently diminished. The surtax was raised from 120 to 134 per cent in February and 150 in March and finally fixed at 160 per cent throughout the year. (b) Fair and unfair incidence.—ad valorem duty is assessed on the selling price of the article in the bazaar, which usually fluctuates, and conse quently the merchants have to pay duty not only on the ci.f. value of the goods, but nearly 40 per cent added, 15 per cent being in the name of ‘ Sudur ’ (export). (e) Interference and obstructions on part of tax collectors .—There is little to be heard of now in this connection. 4. Military. (а) Commandeering of transport. —Military opera tions on a small scale were undertaken at the end of April 1932 in the area of Biyaban when transport was commandeered. ( б ) Extortions and interference with trade and in industry .—Nil. (c) Effects of conscription.—11 men were enlisted for this force- during the year, and most of thosewho were fit for service, but exempted on irregular grounds, were on scrutinizing the list called upon to join again. 5. Agriculture. (а) Area under cultivation, more or less. —This is the same as in the previous year. ( б ) The Harvest. —The harvest, in general, espe cially the date harvest, was satisfactory. The rainfall was abundant. The wheat crop was on the whole a failure. The scarcity of wheat and barley was greatly felt during the latter part of the Persian year and this pushed up the price a little. Representations were made by the local Baladieh and merchants to the Central Government, who imported wheat from ’ Iraq for local consumption and a portion of same was dis tributed to agriculturers for sowing against under taking either to return in kind after the harvest or to pay the price. 6. Opium. Opium is not grown in Bandar Abbas district. The addicts receive their supply from Kerman and Bushire Malieh Departments. Since the Persian Government reduced the Ban derol charges from Rials 3*60 to Rials MO per miskal, the smuggling of this commodity has practi cally stopped but the monthly consumption, ac cording to Malieh figures, increased from 1250 to about 2500 miskals. 7. Industry. (a) to (d). —Nil. (e) Electricity. —The power house which belongs to one Haji Sheikh Ahmed Gelladary contains a very old piece of machinery. In the past, it never worked regularly or satisfactorily. For some time it was closed, but in January last it was put into working order with the help of a mechanic. At present the Power house has been taken over and formed into a company concern. Tomans 3,200 had been collected from the share holders and the Municipality agreed to pay Tomans 1,800. They work at a loss, as the lights consumed are very few in number. In the month of May the ice plant attached to this power house was made use of and ice was prepared. The quality was not good and loss was sustained. Recently an Engineer was sent for from Indian, with a view to having his expert opinion on the work ing of the plant and to making estimates for the new plant. It is very doubtful if a new plant will be purchased, but there is every possibility of the present one being repaired for the running of lighting, ice-making, flour grinding and an aerated water factory. (/) Demand for foreign machinery. —None. (g) Development of mines if any. —The only mine in this area is that on the Island of Hormuz where Red Oxide of iron is found 4,200 tons of ore were shipped by British vessels during the year to the following places:— Tons. United Kingdom .... 2,00||^ Germany ...... 2,00^^ India ...... 200 8. Communications and Transport. (a), (b) and (c). —No new roads have been cons tructed during the year. The constructions of Mohammerah—Charbar road remains in abeyance. The Tang-i-Zagh pass on the motor road between Bandar Abbas and Kerman was washed away by the winter rains, and motor traffic was suspended for a fortnight. This was repaired, but not to the satisfaction of the public. (d) Average rates, summer and winter on chief trade routes. —These have been tabulated in Appen dix II. (e) Effect of motors on animal transport. —Animal transport is now becoming extinct. During the year some caravans accepted goods even under Rials 100 per Kharwar, which is four donkey loads, for a journey to Kerman extending about 22 days. This means a donkey can earn just slightly more than Rial one per day, which is barely sufficient for its feeding let alone the earning of the charvadar. The rates for motor transport also decreased to Rials 130 per Kharwar going to Kerman and returning either empty or earning only Rials 50 per Kharwar. This low rate means heavy loss, but the Persians usually carry on without any calculation, till they are hopelessly involved. (/) Air Services—Whether used for commercial freights. —Liners of the Imperial Airways Limited have ceased to function via Lingah and Jask from October 1932 and now take the new route via Bahrain and Shargah. (g) Security. —The road to Kerman remained comparatively safe during the year, except for a few isolated cases of robberies. 9. Social. (а) Standard of living. —As reported in the previous years, no improvements have been made. The ordinary necessaries of life consisting of native produce were available, but clothes and articles imported from foreign countries were very expensive and sometimes unobtainable. ( б ) Unemployment. —As there are no local indus tries, very little employment is obtainable in the seaport towns except fishing, lighterage for shipsand labour required for the handling of cargo on board ships and in the Customs House at Bandar Abbas. (c) Evidence oj emigration. —Nil. (d) Municipal service, public health and Hygiene .— The long reputed Charitable Dispensary of Bandar Abbas administered in the past by the British Con- sula^Mvas closed at the beginning of the year and re-ojPled from the 14th February 1933. The funds collected for the maintenance of the hospital through the Persian merchants amounted to approxi mately Tomans 2,200 ; 57 men having contributed in this subscription and it has been estimated to last for one year. The contribution for the half year is paid up and deposited in the Bank. The dispensary has been named Sahiyeh Baladiyeh (Municipal Health Department), although the con tributors were not in favour of this nomemclature, and insisted on naming it Marizkhaneh Milli (Na tional Hospital). The dispensary has been well-known to the public in the past and although another dispensary is maintained (under Persian Quarantine Department) the general public makes more use of this one, where in the past they have been so attentively looked after. Arrangements are being made to provide 6 beds for in-door patients, but through paucity of staff, this may not turn out a success. Two beds are already provisionally arranged for. In spite of the extreme poverty of the masses, the general health of the town is fair. Malaria is most prevalent and after this diseases of the eye take precedence. Guineaworm has been prevalent in an epidemic form during the last one month. No notifiable infectious or contagious disease is observed. The Barka water system • (the chief source of drink ing water) is still the same as it was 300 years ago. No alternative has yet been found to replace it by modern methods, with the result that the general public, using this water is usually attacked with guineaworm. Owing to the paucity of sweepers the streets and bazaars are very dirty, and unsightly. There does not appear to be a regular and well organized in spection of the butchers, fishermen, etc. and of the hamams, hotels and garages. The Municipal Committee consists of six repre sentatives from the public with the Governor at its head as Rais-i-Baladiyeh. The construction of a road for the town was taken in hand and about 15 houses have been demolished. Some of the owners have been paid compensation which amounts to about Tomans 1,300 and others have been given lands in some quarters. About 500 yards of the road is levelled up on a temporary basis, as it could be washed out by a small rainfall, and about 300 yards still remain unsightly, there being no funds. The construction of a qanat system to supply drinking water to the town was taken in hand. Its source was from Maiband and was brought down to the entrance of the town. It is a mere trench system but owing to heavy rain in March it was washed away at different places. Up to the present about Tomans 10,000 have been spent and the next year the work will again be taken in hand and the money will be paid from a reserved fund of Tomans 1,700 now with the Military.- 10. Shipping and Freight. (а) Shipping .—75 steamers aggregating 159,990 tons entered and cleared the port during the year 1932-33. Of these, 63 vessels with a total tonnage of 129,239 were under British flag; Russia was represented by the Soviet Mercantile Fleet of which 10 ships with a total tonnage of 23,722 entered and cleared the port; 2 vessels of the German Hansa Line with a total tonnage of 7,029 entered and clear ed the port. The shipping of all nationalities, which entered and cleared the port, is tabulated in Appendix I. ( б ) Freights. —Freights ruling during the year were as follows :— To London— Carpets . Sh. 100 per ton of 40 cubic feet. Almonds . „ 55 per ton of 10 cwts. Pistachio nuts . „ 60 per ton of 10 cwts. or 40 eft. Gum . „ 62-6 per ton of 17 cwts. Gum . , 65 per ton of 40 eft.

What gives the Soviet an unnatural advantage is their state trading organisation and their commercial treaty with Persia, under which the Persians have been foolish enough to allow them to obtain a privileged position. But Perso-Soviet relations are at present very strained m regard to the question of Russo-Persian trade, and there seems some hope that the Persians may be able to obtain a revision of the treaty. i— odcj /ii# y/rUr^u.

If the Report is printed, I shall be glad if 14 fopies could be sent to me &gt; 'p i ENGl.CSUHc IN INDIA FOREIGN SECF 24Report on the Trade and Commerce of the District of Bandar Abbas for the Persian year 1 309. 1. Trade. (a) General conditions. —The whole conditions of trade in Bandar Abbas during the year 1309 were influenced by Government action in fixing a rate of Exchange and in controlling the purchase and sale of Foreign Exchange. The sterling rate of Exchange was krans 60 in the beginning and rose to krans 90 for a pound at the close of the year. These rates of Exchange had no actual relation to the metallic value of the kran in ratio to gold, nor were they based on considerations of supply and demand. Exporters, therefore, in order to get better value for their exports had, during the course of the year, been selling their exchange in the bazaar where the pound sterling fluctuated between 100 and 120 krans. The Banks, having to buy at the fixed Government rates of exchange, obtained very little foreign currency in this market and it is difficult, therefore, to estimate the volume of trade as com pared with previous years, from that point of view. Those adversely affected in Bandar Abbas were the Hindu merchants, who had fairly large stocks of piece-goods on hand when the Law controlling Foreign Exchange came into force. They were unable to buy exchange in liquidation thereof, and consequently were compelled to export Persian products, very often at a loss, in an endeavour to remit payment abroad. The Russian influx of goods of a cheaper nature further increased the Hindus’ difficulties. A noticeable change attributable to the Foreign Exchange Law was an almost entire absence of dealings in rupee currency. The Commerce is con ducted by a few well-to-do Persian merchants who have offices in Kerman, Yezd, Ispahan, Tehran and the Russian Sharq Company. The Customs revenue do not show much reduc tion for the period under review, but as the tariffs have been increased, it is difficult to make an accurate estimate of the volume of trade from the figures alone. This has undoubtedly declined con siderably and will continue to do so to a greater extent in the ensuing year, owing to the enactment in February 1931 of the Foreign Trade Monopoly Law. Another noticeable feature is the almost entire abtence of luxurious articles passing through the Customs at Bandar Abbas due to the Exchange restrictions. Appendix I gives a list of the principal articles of import with their values but the figures must be considered to be only approximate, the local Customs administration declining to furnish official statistics, as formerly. Notes on the Trade of the Lingah District. —This continues to decline fast, and Lingah gives the impression of being a deserted town. The total volume of trade during the Persian year 1309 was valued at krans 3,750,000 approximately against krans 7,440,000 in the preceding year. Imports decreased by about 38 per cent and amounted to krans 2,844,300 against krans 4,400,000 in 1308. The values of the principal articles of import were cotton piece-goods—krans 996,830, rice—krans 771,740, sugar—krans 152,730, tea—krans 112,900 and timber—krans 103,680. The principal exports were carpets, dates and dried fruits, valued at krans 210,500, 111,400 and 82,100 respectively. The Export trade suffered more severely and the total value of exports declined from krans 2,960,500 in 1308 to krans 905,360 during the year under review. ( 6 ) New items of trade. —Rubber goods and sewing machines imported from Russia by the Sharq Com pany and the Export to India of ghee by Hindu and Persian merchants with the object of collecting Foreign Exchange in India for import purposes may be said to be the only new items under this head. (c) New Trade channels. —The Sharq Company advertised the acceptance, at low rates, by steamers of the Soviet Mercantile Fleet, of cargo including Red Oxide of iron ore, for ports abroad, but, owing to the irregular and unreliable service, failed to secure freights. (d) Growth of Foreign competition and danger to British interests resulting therefrom. —The chief com petitor in the Persian market is Russia, who con tinues steadily to strengthen her position. The total value of her imports during the year amounted to over six and a half million krans. Her share in the piece-goods trade in which she specialises was brans 2,735,000 out of a total of krans 8,153,000 or about 33 per cent thereof.The Russian Sharq Company whose import of , piece-goods in 1308 amounted to krans 150,000 only increased that figure during the year under review by krans 2,585,000 approximately. During the same year, viz., 1309, the shares of Manchester and British India in this line were krans 3,700,000 and krans 1,700,000 respectively. In regard to sug q t, Russia also holds a predomi nant position. Her share amounted to krans 3,010,000 out of a total import of that commodity valued at krans 5,320,000 representing nearly 60 per cent. This was chiefly at the expense of Bel gium and Java. The greater part of the general imports from abroad came from the United Kingdom and India. A certain feature has been the persistence of a few German firms in continuing exports in spite of the extraordinary difficulties in obtaining Exchange. (e) The Russians.—Their trading methods — Popu larity—Success or failure. —In spite of granting credits, of course only to a very limited extent and obtaining re-imbursement by small instalments, the Russians cannot be said to be popular. Their determination to sell tends to make them cut prices even against merchants in the same market, to whom they may have sold goods. The Russians, nevertheless, have virtually secured ij a monopoly in the local markets in the lines of goods In i n which they specialize. Their success lies in the ft fact of their having practically solved the difficulty j| of obtaining Foreign Exchange by their system of j I barter. The introduction at the end of the year of the Foreign Trade Monopoly Law, however detrimental to trade in general, promises to be advantageous to the Russians for the above reason. (/) Credits offered by foreign firms as opposed to those granted by British firms. —Credits formerly offered by foreign firms, especially those in Germany, ceased automatically on the introduction of the Control of Foreign Exchange. It would not be out of place to sound a warning note here to British firms, who under the present conditions should tread very cautiously in the Persian market and demand a full deposit in foreign currency before shipment is made to cover cost of shipment and return, should the goods not be taken up. ip) Popularity of foreign goods due to quality, price, terms of payment, e&lt;c.—British goods, especially Manchester textiles, in spite of dearness in price, maintain their reputation in respect of quality, whereas the cheap Russian piece-goods that have, in the past year or so, flooded the Persian market are being found to be deteriorating in quality. (h) Openings of British goods. —The new regula tions may be said to have restricted trade consider ably if it is possible to trade at all under present conditions. (i and j) Over-trading and Commercial Morality.-— There is very little over-trading and the merchants in spite of ever-increasing obstacles to trade have maintained their financial reputation. 2. Financial. (a) Tightyiess of money — to what extent due to restriction of credit, exchange, insecurity, extra taxa tion, bad harvests, etc. —-The average selling rates between 22nd March 1930 and 21st March 1931 were :■—• Krans 62 - 92 . . . . . . £1 Krans 467 , 04 ..... Rs. 100 The maximum and minimum rates during the year were :— Krans 90 and krans 59$ . , . £ 1 Krans 666 and 442 .... Rs. 100 Owing to the nature of Bandar Abbas Commerce, money may always be said to be tight, in the sense that money is always in demand. The local mer chants are engaged largely in clearing goods from the Customs and forwarding up-country for which purpose money is required in payment of Customs duties and taxes. The appreciably increased Customs duties caused an increased demand for money. Owing to the establishment of two banks in. Bandar Abbas, it is justifiable to assume that the merchants receive greater credit facilities than hither to and from that point of view, money may be said to be less tight. (6) Evidence of private capital unemployed or held abroad. —Owing to the control of Foreign Exchange, and the depreciation of the kran, Persian merchants are not now utilizing their deposits in Banks out side Persia, but are trading with their kran capital in the country. (c) Diversion of capital from trade to other purpose or vice vesa.— Nil. (d) Bankruptcies.—-No bankruptcies were report ed during the year. (e) Competition among local Batiks.—The National Bank of Persia was established here in July 1930 and, at the date of writing, appears to have con firmed its position as well as can be expected in the time. Naturally rates were cut finer than before, and this fact coupled with the granting of interest on current accounts and the support received from Government, the Army and Municipal offices, has assisted in its consolidation.3. Taxation. ( a ) Effect, on purchasing power. —The following increased taxation was imposed during the year : i. A surtax of 20 per centum on the gross Customs duty (except on ad valorem articles) as from the 10th April 1930, which was subsequently increased to 80 per centum from the 8th February 1931. ii. Owing to the Central Government having suspended grants from the “ Compound ed Road Tax Fund ’ to Provincial Municipalities the Municipality was em powered to raise revenue by means of local taxation and the levy of various tolls. iii. The Postal Department enhanced the post age rates for foreign countries by 20 per centum as from the 1st July 1930, and later added 50 per centum thereon from the 11th March 1931. iv. The Income-tax Act that was passed by the Persian Mejliss on the 1st April 1930 was enforced in this district as from the beginning of the year. v. A two-shahi stamp was introduced for affixing to all cheques, drafts, etc., from the 11th May 1930. The imposition of increased taxation has un doubtedly helped to diminish the purchasing power of the inhabitants. 4. Military. (a) Commandeering of transport. —Military opera tions on a small scale were undertaken at the end of the year, when transport was commandeered. (&amp;) Effects of conscription. —Conscription has not as yet been enforced in the district but at the close of the year, a Census office was opened where the inhabitants were required to register their names, ages and addresses. This is considered by the townspeople to be the thin edge of the conscription wedge. 5. Agriculture. (a) Area under cultivation, more or less. —This is the same as the preceding year. {h) The Harvest. —The harvest, in general, especial ly the date harvest, was satisfactory. The rainfall was abundant and phenomenal in comparison with pre\ious years, but the appearance of locusts caused some damage and destroyed about 30 per cent of the product of the whole district. (e) Introduction of new crops and Machinery.— The cultivation of tobacco, which was abandoned in 1922, owing to heavy taxes then demanded by the Maliyeh Department from the cultivators, has been considerably revived since the introduction of the Tobacco Monopoly Law and the prohibitive Customs duties of 110 per cent in addition to the permit required by the Customs for the import on foreign tobacco. All experiments for the growing of tea in the Sar- khun district proved to be a failure. (d) Irrigation, more or less water. —There were no improvements and the same primitive methods were employed. A scheme for irrigating the town by means of a qanat which was taken in hand by the Municipality last year is still where it began and nothing has been done beyond digging a few test wells. (e) Extent to which land hypothecated. —As the local cultivator and land-owner gets poorer daily hypothecation in favour of the wealthy merchants in the towns continues. 6. Opium. Opium is not grown in the Bandar Abbas district. The town receives its supply from Kerman and Fars, chiefly from, the latter. There is, however, no re presentative of the Maliyeh Department in the out lying villages. The increased taxation has encouraged smuggling. The monthly consumption has increased by at least 26 per cent ami is estimated to be from 1,000 to 1,250 miscals, three-fourths of which is “ unbandroll- ed ” stuff. No changes worthy of comment have been in troduced by the Government during the year. V 7. Industry. (a) to (d) No now industries have been introduced. Owing to restrictions and control imposed by the Government on Foreign Exchange, weaving has to a small extent been revived in the Island of Kishm and villages in the Minab district to take the place of cheap Indian manufactured cloth like lumries and sheets. (e) Electricity. —The electric plant has been kept up during the year at a loss to the proprietor and damage to the plant itself. The supervision of the plant has been frequently changing from the Naz- mieh to the Baladieh and vice versa. (/) Demand for foreign machinery .—There is no demand for foreign machinery. {g) Development of mines, if any.—The only mines which are being worked are the Red Oxide‘of iron mines on Hormuz Island. 1,500 tons of iron ore were exported to Bremen during the year.4 8. Communications and Transport. (a), (6) and (c) No new roads have been con structed. The Tang-i-Zagh pass on the motor road between Bandar Abbas and Kerman was slightly widened during the winter months of the Persian year making it passable for lorries of 1| to 3 tons, with slight difficulty. No other proper repairs have been undertaken between Bandar Abbas and Sirjan. The survey for the construction of a motor road along the Coast between Mohammerah and Charbar was carried out during the year by the Ministry of Roads. A similar survey has been made for a road from Lar to Lingah, whejre it will connect with the coastal road, but the actual work of construc tion has not been started! (d) Average rales, summer and winter, on chief trade routes. —These have been tabulated in Appen dixes VI and VII. ( e ) Effect of motors on animal transport, rates and turnover. —Camels and donkeys that were formerly used for transport of merchandise to Kerman and other places now served by the motor road via the Tang-i-Zagh are utilised for the conveyance of articles not needed urgently up-country, e.g., copper and iron sheets, leaden blocks, bales of yarn and bundles of species. The rates of animal transport by other routes to Kerman, etc., are 30 or 40 per cent lower than those for motor transport. (/) Air Services—whether used for commercial freights. —-Liners of the Imperial A.irways Limited call at Lingah weekly on both the Eastbound and Westbound flights to re-fuel, but the service is purely one for mails and passengers for the present. {g) Security. —On the whole, the security of the trade routes was well maintained, a few isolated instances of robbery on the motor road to Kerman and the holding up of the caravan road between Bandar Abbas and Lar by the followers of the rebel chief Zadun Khan of Gerash being recorded. 9. Social. (а) Standard of livi'ng. —This, as usual, was low and has not improved. The ordinary necessaries of life consisting of native produce were available and cheap, but clothes and articles imported from foreign countries were expensive and not easily obtainable. (б) As there are no local industries, very little employment is obtainable in the seaport town outside fishing, lighterage for ships and labour required for the handling of cargo on board ships and in the Customs House at Bandar Abbas. During the summer months, a big exodus of townspeople takes place to places in the interior, especially to Minab for the date harvest. (c) Evidence of emigration. —In spite of the scarcity of employment, and poor economic condi tions obtaining, there is no evidence of regular or organized emigration. I f (d) Public health and hygiene. —It may be said that local conditions, in spite of the establishment of a municipal board, are still very unsatisfactory. No eSective measures have been undertaken to combat the scourge of malaria and venereal diseases, which are still rife. (e) Municipal services .—A noticeable feature was an attempt made during the year to dig test wells some miles outside Bandar Abbas with the object of giving the town a supply of good drinking water. The experiments being conducted had to be sus pended, owing to various unforeseen circumstances and the advent of the hot weather, but it is hoped to be able to renew these. REPORT ON THE TRADE AND COMMERCE OF THE DISTRICT OF BANDAR ABBAS FOR THE PERSIAN YEAR 1310. 1. Trade. (a) General conditions. —In the report for the year 1309, it was stated that the conditions of trade in this district were influenced by Government action and the same can be said for the year under review. These influences are mentioned briefly under head ings 3 and 4. Exports and imports were well maintained, and in the second half of the year a substantial increase was shown. For example the Customs figures show the value of Exports as krana 5,194,425 and that of Imports as krans 7,377,756 for the first six months of the year and Exports krans 8,166,892 and Imports krans 19,767,457 for the second. The rate of exchange and therefore ) the Customs duty was lower in the latter six months ; J so it is obvious that Trade was much more active! r It is usual for many merchants to proceed up- country during the hot summer months and this is often reflected in slacker trade. In the cool season given good transport conditions, it is natural that business should be more active. The figures quoted above show that imports greatly exceed exports at this port. This is the rule here but is not to be wondered at, when it is considered that the exports are supplied by a hinter land more confined than that supplied by its imports. Goods are forwarded from this port as far north as Ispahan and Tehran while exports from these parts as a rule are sent vid Bushire. In this connection it should be mentioned that V there is a tendency on the part of the 'exporters to over-value their goods when passing them through Customs for shipment. The reason for this isobvious, viz., the higher the valuation, the greater is the amount of their export certificate and the greater, therefore, is the value of the Import certi ficate obtained thereagainst. The result of this over-valuation is that they are enabled to import to a greater value than their exports ; consequently the foreign exchange resulting from their exports is insufficient to pay for their imports, and the merchants are continually on the look-out for oppor tunities to buy foreign exchange to make up the deficit. This is perhaps the reason for the higher value of foreign currency in the bazaar and the readiness of the merchants to buy from the Banks without having to give any undertaking as to the specific disposal of such exchange, if it is available. In last year’s report reference was made to the increased difficulties with which the Hindu merchants were being faced in the conduct of their once exten sive business in Bandar Abbas. During the year under review, several of these Hindu traders gave up their business and returned to India. Our figures in Appendix I as compared with last year’s figures show a considerable decrease in the import of sugar, but this is not a fair comparison for average figures, as it appears that the market was existing on old stock prior to the commence ment of the import of sugar on a large scale by the Russians under their Monopoly which began im mediately after the New year 1311. (b) New items of trade. —The Anglo-Persian Oil Company removed their Agency from Messrs. Dorabjee &amp; Co. during the latter part of the year 1310, and established their own office under one of their Persian Covenanted staff. Their business here and their forwarding upcountry are conducted by this Office. They state that this is more satis factory and in time will become more economical. The Russians are reported to have brought some quantities of lubricating oil for sale here but not to any great extent, and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are not apprehensive of serious competi tion in this line. Russian competition in the oil market should not be overlooked however. The growth of tobacco in the Minab district is said to have made considerable advances in recent years, and the prospects are said to be good. (c) New Trade Channels. —-Inland there is nothing new to report. Under the trading agreement recent ly entered into between Persia and Russia, large consignments of monopoly goods are carried to this port by the Soviet Mercantile Fleet. These ships endeavour to obtain cargoes for Up-Gulf ports but owing to the irregularities of their arrival they cannot be said to do much in this line. (d) Growth of Foreign competition and danger to British interests resulting therefrom. —In the last paragraph, mention was made of the visits to this port of the ships of the Soviet Mercantile Fleet The transport by them of large quantities of sugar, piece -g oods, matches under the Trading agreement is naturally prejudicial to the activities of the British Companies in the Gulf. The diversion to Russia of such a large part of Persia’s trade will divert also a corresponding amount of the carrying trade. This is where the effect of the Russo-Persian Trading agreement will first make itself felt although there is no doubt but that the agreement as a whole is prejudicial to British trade. At the same time the effect of this will not be as noticeable as it would have been a few years ago, for the exchange and import restrictions of the past few years have lessened greatly the trade of this port and neighbourhood with Great Britain. From the published list of the quotas allotted to Russia under the Trading agreeent can readily be seen the nature and extent of this competi tion. The import of Manchester piece-goods at this port has almost ceased although there is a demand for a limited quantity. Japanese piece-goods of a cheap quality have gained ground in the past year, and it is said that this make is second in market consumption. The importers of Japanese goods will probably meet with similar difficulties to those of British, but being a cheaper product the former, once imported, will have a readier market. Apart from the above- mentioned, British interests do not appear to have been affected during the past year. (e) The Russians—Their Trading methods — Popu larity—Success or failure. —The granting to the . Russians by the Persian Government under the j Trading agreement of a monopoly of certain goods notably sugar, matches and oil gives that country j an advantage over any other in the Persian trade. I In addition to this monopoly, the Russians have received a large quota of almost every other import into this country. Their trading methods do not please the local merchants and neither are they popular, but as far as trade is concerned, it is a case of needs must. The Russian Company when selling a consignment of piece-goods, for example, generally foist on to the buyer some cases of sewing machines, sewing thread, clocks or other sundry goods which the latter does not want, and will probably have to sell at a loss. As there are no other sellers of piece-goods in the market at the time, he is forced to accept these ‘ extras ’ or leave the business alone. It is said that in many cases they exact part payment in advance and then are very slack in delivery. Such methods are definite ly unpopular and the obvious advantage they have over the ordinary Persian importer is resented. The Russian Company evidently intend to do H considerable business at this place. Their dwelling house has been enlarged to hold perhaps six people and their office is being commodiously furnished \ \6 Tut 11 U P' to ' d 1 ate manner. It is reported that Bandar Ahbas is to be their headquarters for this area and the present preparations certainly support this rumour. 1 r ( ) Credits offered by Foreign firms as opposed tc those offered by British firms.-There is little evidence that credit to any extent is granted by firms of any country; as far as the import of foreign goods is concerned the granting of credit should 'not be recommended at the present time. The Russian Company may grant limited credit in special cases, but they do not need to grant any facilities in order to attract business. Frequently they are the only people who can supply goods. (g) Popularity of foreign goods due to quality, price, terms of payment, e/c—Foreign goods of a cheap quality have a good sale in this country. The larger part of the population is poor and a cheap article naturally attracts it. British goods are usually of better quality and are more expensive, and under present conditions have hardly a chance to compete. In such sundry goods as shoes, hosiery, under-wear, Japanese and Russian goods hold the market. It is believed that the import of Japanese goods is financed through the Persian merchants’ agents in Bombay, as the Banks do not appear to receive bills for collection against goods emanating from Japan. {h) Openings for British goods.—There is not much of a market for goods at this port, the prin cipal business being the forwarding of merchandise up-country. Any advertising on behalf of British goods would have more value up-country than in Bandar Abbas. A British motor tyre is hardly ever seen in this neighbourhood-sale of a competi tive article of this nature might be developed here At present American tyres hold the field. The Russians are importing a cheap tyre but they are not much in favour as yet. (i) and (j) Over-trading and commercial morality. There is a certain amount of overtrading among the merchants, but the most part of the business at this port is genuine. Local business is of no importance, the merchants who do most of the trade being agents of firms and individuals up-country, m Yezd, Isfahan, Kerman and the Lar district! These agents here conduct the import and export trade on their behalf, clear goods from the Customs, and forward them up-country. Their commercial morality may be said to be maintained, but many are naturally affected by the fortunes of their principals up-country. {k) Working of Law courts in commercial cases.— The district of Bandar Abbas including Minab and Lingah have been without a Law Court during the year under review. It is to be feared that a com mercial case of any kind would have to be referred to Kerman under present conditions, which would entail delay and considerable extra expense. The Governor called a meeting of merchants with the object of forming a Chamber of Commerce here. Certain names were put forward as Executive Members and the authorities in Tehran are under stood to have given their approval. 2. Financial. («) Tightness of money—to what extent due to restriction of credit, exchange, insecurity, extra taxa tion, bad harvests, etc.—The average selling rates between 22nd March 1931 and 20th March 1932 were :— Krans 617 ‘ 15 100 (approximately' The maximum and minimum rates during the year were :— Krans 90 and 61 50 Krans 680-75 and 456 £ 1 Rs. 100 Money was in considerable demand during th year as usual for the clearing of goods from th Customs and their forwarding up-country. Th demand for cash depends on the demand for gooc up-country. Further if tightness of money prevail in the larger towns up-country it is reflected in slackening of trade here or else an attempt by th merchants to discount with the Banks unusuall ong-dated paper. The few local merchants wh have sufficient means to engage in trade to a con siderable extent are not keen to take many risk under present circumstances. There is a feeling o uncertainty in the air, due to the many changes i recent laws of Exchange and trade. Owing to lack of rain during the winter sprini crops foreshadow a shortage during the comin summer. At the end of the year under report th! fc 0r -,? eneral fr0m Bushire made a tooc of th, South Gulf ports to investigate the situation arisim from the shortage of rainfall. He found evidence! of distress in various small ports principally on th, lakran Coast and he stated that supplies of wheal were being despatched from Basrah. There is Igainlrthf K\ COmplaiIlt , ara0ng the p00r cIass * against the high prices of staple articles of food such as sugar, nee, tea, etc. With two Banks in Bandar Abbas there is nc Ciente oHhe Ba r nk“ 8t ‘ fiable PUrP ° SeS “ d * 0 re,labl ' i (&gt;&gt;) Evidence of private capital unemployed ot held abroad .Those merchants who heW fund country “at, ^ ^ ^ th “&gt;* »&gt;“ k ^ country at present.

(d) Bankruptcies. —No bankruptcies were report ed during the year. (e) Competition among local Banks. —The Imperial Bank of Persia and the National Bank of Persia are both established here. Banking business here is limited and not sufficient to keep two Banks employed on a paying basis. There is keen com petition for what business there is and rates are cut very fine in consequence, to the advantage of the local merchants. 2-A. Effect of Exchange control and Monopoly Laws on Trade. The Monopoly Law ratified by the Mojless at the end of the year 1309 rendered the Exchange Laws superfluous, hut the latter were not abolished until nearly the end of the year under review. The tendencies noted in the Report for 1309 have been maintained during this year. Dealings in Foreign Exchange have been confined almost ex clusively to the bazaars, the rates therein being constantly several points higher than the official Bank rates. In theory, under the Monopoly Laws, the exports should pay for the imports and no imports are permitted, generally speaking, without being com pensated for by exports, but the fact remains that there is always a fairly steady demand for free Rupee exchange, that is, exchange obtained without any undertaking to import or to conform with any existing laws. It may be supposed that the reason for this demand is that merchants over-value their exports to the Customs in order to obtain a higher value certificate of exportation and thus a higher value Import Licence. It is said that the Customs did not discourage this over-valuation but within recent months the regulations have been tightened up, and great care is said to be exercised in prevent ing such abuses. A demand for exchange is un doubtedly created by merchants who, through over valuation of their exports and through inability to obtain a market for them abroad, have been unable to fulfil their undertakings to import to the value of their exports or alternatively to sell the proceeds thereof to the Government. Merchants in such a predicament find that the Licence Department in Tehran is becoming increasingly strict and fresh licences are being refused to those merchants who have not fulfilled properly their engagements. It might be thought that prices for local products might be stimulated by a demand for exportation in order to apply for import licences but it is report ed that there is no marked increase in prices. This is probably due to the universal depression. The granting to the Russian Company of such large quotas of the import trade of the country tends to make the business of the merchants of this port internal to an increasing degree. The Russians import the goods and the merchants buy from them or from the Customs in the case of sugar and matches (although during the year under review no great quantities of the latter have been imported). With regard to the sugar the price fixed Ex : Customs by the Government is complained of as being exces sively high. Merchants are inclined to buy for immediate requirements only. The precise enactments of recent laws in connec tion with the Trade Monopoly are very trying to some of the Persian merchants. Cases occur when the goods arrive at the port, the consignee finds that his import licence is not in order, the expiry date having lapsed perhaps, and the consequence r is that the goods remain in Customs uncleared and incurring charges. Their clearing date becomes problematical. Delay in arrival of the goods is sometimes not the fault of the consignee here. If the goods are shipped by a line which does not call regularly at this port, they are liable to be over-carried to Bas rah, transhipped to the B. I. S. N. Co.’s ship and a delay of a month is the result. Instances have occurred when prohibited goods shipped to this port have not been allowed to be landed on Persian Territory at all. The point to be emphasised is that firms abroad who intend to ship goods to this country should be alive to the fact that, through one cause or another, delays in clear ing or taking up the consignments are liable to occur and that they should cover themselves against liabilities arising therefrom. Merchants are gradually becoming accustomed to the multitudinous forms to be filled up when exporting or importing, but they make continuous endeavour to evade the fulfilment of their under takings, particularly where foreign exchange is concerned. 3. Taxation. (a) Effect on purchasing power — Customs.— The following increases of Customs duty took place during the year. On the 28th Bahman, an increase of 40 per cent took place, this was increased to 150 per cent on 11th Esfand and reduced to 136 per cent on the 16th Esfand 1310. The high price fixed by the Government for the monopoly of sugar together with the increased Customs duty mentioned above hit the poorer classes very heavily. Consumption of sugar is said to have decreased owing to the high price. The Maleyeh (Revenue) office has called upon land owners to declare the nature of their property,8 atmttal income (gross and nett), etc., for the intended revision of land taxation. 4. Military. («) Commandeering of transport. —During the year tinder report owing to operations incidental to the disarming of the tribes in the Beyaban and Basha- kard districts the military authorities had occasion to commandeer animal transport for despatching stores for the troops to Minab. (b) Extortions and interference with, trade and industry. —The Military do not appear to give any trouble in the above connection here although in the outlying villages they take advantage of whatever opportunity offers, generally in the way of food. (c) Effects of conscription. —The Census office was opened during the beginning of the Persian year- Several visits of inspection were paid by officers for conscription purposes to this town and fair num bers of young men joined the Army. The matter seems to have engaged the serious attention of the authorities, and the National Bank and Customs Administration were informed, it is understood, that objections to their staffs being called up would not be allowed. The introduction of conscription at first caused alarm on the illiterate public ; so much so that for some days labour was difficult to obtain. It is estimated that between six and seven thousand people have emigrated from Minab and Kishm Island to the Arab Coast. 5. Agriculture. (a) Area under cultivation more or less. —There is no change in the above. (b) The Harvest. —The principal crop in this district is the Date crop of Minab. The season for dates during the year under review was a good one, and they were in great demand by exporters for the purpose of obtaining an Import Licence against the Export certificate. The wheat crop was not a great success, this is referred to in paragraph 2(a) above. In the North the crops of pistachios and dried fruit showed a falling off as compared with the previous year. (c) Introduetion of new crops and new methods .— The cultivation of tobacco in the Minab district is reported to be increasing. No new' crops were introduced nor any agricultural machinery imported. (&lt;2) Irrigation, more or less water. —There is no change to report under this heading. Irrigation of crops is effected as before by wells from which the water is drawn by oxen or other animals. A scheme for bringing w r ater from an outlying district for the use of the town by means of a Qanat has been a little further advanced during the winter but the work appears to have been stopped and is still a long way from fruition. The ‘ Jub ’ system is still in force in Minab and Shamilat and there was no complaint as to the shortage of water. (e) Extent to which land is hypothecated. —As mentioned in the last report the tendency is increas ing for the small land-holder to hypothecate his lands to the wealthier merchants in the town, many of whom are now large holders. 6. Opium. Opium is not grown in the Bandar Abbas district. The addicts receive their supply from the Kerman district and that of Ears. On the 7th Mordad 1310 the Persian Government reduced the Banderol charges from krans 3-60 per miskal to krans 1-10 per miskal. This large reduction has practically stopped the smuggling of this commodity which used to be prevalent. The monthly consumption is said to be 1,000 to 1,250 miskals. 7. Industry. (a) to (d) — Nil. (e) Electricity. —The electric light plant installed in the town a few years ago gives a very inadequate service. It is often out of order and does not by any means supply light to any but a small propor tion of the population. There was a talk during the year under report that a German firm having representative in Tehran (A. E. G.) had communicat ed with the Municipality with a view to re-organis ing the electric light system of the town ; up to date of writing nothing further has been done. (f) Demand for foreign machinery. —Apart from that mentioned in the preceding paragraph, there is none, especially in view' of the low rate of exchange of Rials. {g) Development of mines, if any. —The only mine in this area is that on the Island of Hormuz where Red Oxide is found. 2^000 tons approximately were exported during the year. 8. Communication and Transport. (a), (b) and (c) No new roads have been construct ed. The main road to Kerman has been still further improved during the year. The most dangerous part of the Tang-i-Zagh pass has been buttressed from below, and made a little wider. A squad of men has been engaged more or less continuously4 9 during the year and except for the flood season the post lorries maintained a steady service. The new road from Lar to Lingah is nearing completion, and the Oustoms otflcials state that the proposed road from Bushire to Charhar along the Coast, which has surveyed last year, is being taken well in hand. State of communications generally. These may be said to be as follows :— (i) Persian Telegraph Office; (ii) Weekly postal communications between the Gulf Ports and the outside world by means of the British India Steam Navigation Company’s Slow Mail Service; (iii) Bi-weekly motor service with Kerman and interior; and have been functioning satis factorily during the year. (d) Average rates summer and winter on chief trade centres. —Tables of average rates for motor and animal transport to the chief centres are furnished as Appendix IV. (e) Effect of motors on animal transport, rates and turnovers. —Camels and donkeys still transport goods up-country but only such which are not ur gently required. Motor transport is gradually dis placing animal transport, but it is surprising that the amount of goods still sent up-country by animals is fairly considerable. The rates for the latter are 30 to 40 per cent less than those for the former. (O Air services—whether used for commercial freights. —There are no Air services to this port. Liners of the Imperial Airways Limited call at Lingah weekly both on the Eastbound and West bound flights to re-fuel, but the service is one for mails and passengers only. (g) Security.—On the whole the security of the trade routes was well maintained during the year. One or two cases of brigandage on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman Road were reported, and on one occasion, a General of the Persian Army was serious ly wounded and afterwards died. 9. Social. (а) Standard of Living. —This, as usual, was low and showed no improvement. The ordinary neces saries of life consisting of native produce were avail able and cheap, but clothes and articles imported from foreign countries expensive and not easily obtainable. (б) Unemployment. —As there are no local indus tries, very little employment is obtainable in the sea-port towns outside fishing, lighterage for ships and labour required for the handling of cargo on board ships and in the Customs House at Bandar Abbas. During the summer months, a big exodus of the townspeople takes place to places in the interior, especially to Minab for the date harvest. (c) Evidence of emigration. —In spite of the scarcity of employment, and poor economic conditions obtaining, there is no evidence of regular or organiz ed emigration. {d) Public health and hygiene. —It may be said that local conditions, in spite of the establishment of a Municipal board, are still very unsatisfactory. No effective measures have been undertaken to combat the scourge of malaria and venereal diseases, which are still rife. The Town Charitable Dispensary that was estab* fished in 1919 by public subscription and has func tioned most satisfactorily since under British aus pices, was closed down at the close of the year under record on the withdrawal of the Medical Officer of this Consulate who was also in charge of that institution. (e) Municipal services. —Further attempts were made to dig the test wells outside Bandar Abbas, referred to in last year’s report, but no progress was made and the work had again to be suspended with the advent of the hot weather. New taxes were introduced at the beginning of 1310 when the Central Government ceased its con tribution towards the maintenance of the Bandar Abbas Municipal Budget. Although the local taxation is considered to be sufficient, no improvement in the direction of muni cipal administration is noticeable. G. A.

Biscoe, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 108, dated the 16th January 1930. I have the honour to enclose the annual report on the Trade and Navigation of the Bandar Abbas Consular district for 1928-29. 2. If this report is printed, I shall be glad if 16 copies could be sent to me. 3. A copy of this report has been forwarded to the Department of Overseas Trade.NOTES ON CURRENCY, ETC. Currency. 20 Shahis . j Kran. 10 Krans \ Toman. ^■por the purposes of rough calculation, a Toman based on the average rate of exchange ruling during the year 1928-29 may be taken to be equal to 4 Shillings and 3 Pence or Rupees 2 and annas 12 approximately. During the year, the Krans has depreciated about 10% approximately. Coinage Current in District. Nickel pieces of 1 and 2 Shahis; silver of 1, 2 and 5 Krans ; Imperial Bank of Persia notes for 1,2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, etc., tomans and Indian rupees. Rupees though not as plentiful as formerly are still available but Indian Currency Notes are scarce. In spite of the Government prohibition, commercial transactions are still conducted in Indian rupees to a certain extent. Marked progress has been made in the direction of the clearance from circulation of defective coin, to wards which the Imperial Bank of Persia has greatly contributed. It is estimated that the local branch of that Bank has collected debased coins to the value of Krans 222,990 during the Persian year 1307 (1928-29) and despatched them to Tehran to be re-minted.

General Conditions. (a) Trade on the whole continued to be dull throughout the year with some slight improvement during the cold weather after the return of the principal merchants from their summer migration to the neighbouring Ginau Hills and other places in the interior. There was a dislocation of trade for three months (from August to October) owing to the sanitary restrictions imposed on vessels arriving from the ports of Bombay and Karachi which for some un known reason were declared to have been infected with cholera. The total volume of trade of the district which for Customs purposes comprises Jask, Charbar, Tiab (port of Minab) and Kishim Island aggregated Krans 50,254,079 against Krans 64,748,174 for the preced ing year. Import .—The imports amounted to Kran a 31,159,708 being less by Krans 11,318,312 than those for 1506. Out of the above total, merchandise valued at Krans 28,730,364 was introduced through the port of Bandar Abbas. Sugar. The sugar trade that had suffered in recent years by the imposition of the monopoly and compounded road taxes, received a competitive stimulus by the appearance for the first time of Russian sugar in the market. The import of this commodity showed an increased value of Krans 305,524 which is equivalent to about 10 per cent over the preceding year’s figures. Piece-goods. It was remarked in the report for the Persian year 1306, that large stocks of piece-goods were lying unsold in the markets of the interior. The import during 1307 dropped by about 27 per cent, chiefly affecting Manchester, owing to the introduc tion of Russian piece-goods which immediately found favour in the local markets. Cotton Yalrn. This dropped by 50 pej* centum, and was attri butable chiefly to a ve#£ insignificant import from Japan as compared with 1306. The demand from the United Kingdom was smaller also. Kerosine Oil. During the year under review, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited imported from their works at Abadan 271,032 gallons in cases and tins of 8 and 4 gallons respectively and sold locally or despatched to interior for sale 243,964 gallons. At the end of the year 83,492 gallons remained in stock. The “ Tiger ” Brand of the Standard Oil Company of New York made no progress in the market. Only 9,904 gallons of oil were sold from old stocks. Petrol. The British Petroleum Company’s products are most favoured in the district. 85,532 gallons of this quality were introduced by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited and 55,752 gallons were sold locally or forwarded to Kerman and Yezd during the year. In addition, 9,700 gallons of Blended Aviation Spirit and Benzol were shipped to this port by the same Company of which 4,952 gallons were issued for the consumption of aircraft that called here to re-fuel. Export.—The. export trade suffered owing to the devastation of crops by the invasion of locusts, the incidence of poor rainfall in the interior, and poli tical trouble. However, the figures registered at this port, viz., Krans 19,094,371 showed an increase of Krans 2,000,000 over the preceding year’s total. This is attributable in the main to the diversion of the route by which carpets had previously been despatched from the Kerman district to the United States of America, the United Kingdom and India, and to the dislocation caused by the Military opera tions that were undertaken against Dost Mahomed of Baluchistan.'A Carpets. Statistical Tables. The value of carpets that were exported abroad from the Kerman district through this port amount ed to Krans 10,164,239, being 100 per cent greater than in the preceding year. Raw Cotton. This fell from Krans 3,434,211 in 1306 to Krans 1,503,340 during the year under review. Statistical tables in respect of the Import and Export trade of Bandar Abbas and Lingah are attach ed to this report. Trade Routes. A table showing the caravan routes leading to the principal centres of trade in the interior with a list of transport rates obtaining during the year, is appended. Dried Fruits. Pistachio and almonds were plentiful and found a ready sale in foreign markets, but other dried fruits suffered owing to the ravages of locusts. Dates. NEW ITEMS OF TRADE AND NEW TRADE CHANNELS. (6) a nd (c) The fo rmer consisted of Russian sugar (loaf andsoft) and^ussTah piece-goods, chiefly prints, appearing in the Bandar Abbas market for the first time. The date crop at Minab was considerably affected during the locust invasion, and the value of the export was about 50 per cent less. Red Oxide of Iron. The whole of the iron ore mined at the Island of Hormuz was shipped to the United Kingdom where the demand was good. LINGAH TRADE. The Customs Statistics show that this trade con tinues to decline fast. The total volume of trade registered in 1307 was valued at Krans 5,137,753 against Krans 7,423,718 in 1306 which is equivalent to a decrease of 30*8 per cent. Rice and Flour. These commodities used to be imported in con siderable quantities in former years for the consump tion of the natives engaged in the pearling and boat building industries. Only half the usual quantities were introduced owing to the disappearance of such trades. In fact Lingah pearlers have their require ments shipped to Dubai. Sugar. For a similar reason, the figures show that a little more than 25 per cent of sugar as having been imported in 1307 as compared with the preceding year. The increase in the smuggling from the Arab Coast may also have accounted for this fact. Export .—These fell from Krans 1,726,266 to Krans 1,099,185. The decrease to the extent of 36 per cent is attributed chiefly to the fact that no pearls were registered as having been exported from this place. They were introduced by the inauguration of a Soviet Line of Steamers from Odessa to the Persian Gulf. In one instance, a consignment of Russian piece-goods for Bandar Abbas was transhipped at Port Said to a British vessel. (d) The principal articles of foreign manufacture or produce that menace British trade interests are Russian piece-goods and sugar, and ammunition. Russian competition in cotton goods has already begun to drive those once predominant British manu factured articles from the local markets. (e) It is unusual to find business done under credit but it is remarkable that certain German firms, in order to secure business will book orders received from local traders of no commercial standing against comparatively low deposits, e.^., 25 per cent without any enquiry as to their morality and financial status. (/) Russian prints in particular are more favoured than the Manchester manufactured articles prin cipally owing to their cheapness in price, although they cannot be said to be of superior quality. They are more fancied and perhaps better suited to local requirements. On one occasion recorded during the year, Russian piece-goods were sold at prices nearly 50 per cent less than those of Manchester piece-goods. The prices of sporting guns and ammunition which are now chiefly imported from Germany are also found to be much cheaper in comparison to those of British manufacture that used at one time to mono polize the market. The trade in sugar imported into the district, although not a British grown product, was in the past, to a great extent, in the hands of British Indian merchants. They are now embarassed with the competition of Russian sugar owing to the extra ordinary tactics employed by the Soviet Agents. The latter offer sugar landed at Bandar Abbas and transported to the interior, e.g., to places like Raf-! sinjan, Kerman and Yezd, at the same prices as ; those accepted by them at that sea-port, making it impossible for Indian traders to handle this pro duct. (g) and (h) No overtrading has been observed during the year nor is such usual. The commercial morality of local firms, which in the opinion of the Bank Manager is of a fairly high standard, was maintained. There was very little &lt;Afency, if any, towards speculation. 2. FINANCIAL. (a) No particular tightness of money was in evidence. The average selling rates quoted by the Imperial Bank of Persia during the year were : Krans 48*30 per £1 Sterling Krans 365*45 per Rs. 100. The maximum and minimum rates during the year were :— Krans 51*25 and Krans 46*25 respectively per £1 Sterling. Krans 384*50 and Krans 348*50 respectively per Rs. 100. (b) It is generally known that the bulk of the capital of the principal merchant in the district, a Persian, is invested abroad but solely in British shipping, commercial and Banking firms. (c) No bankruptcies of any importance were recorded. 3. TAXATION. (a) The high Customs tariff and exorbitant tolls continue to restrict the purchasing power of traders, and to further drive what little trade remains at the port of Lingah to the opposite Arabian shores. Incidence of Taxation. (b) The principal sources of revenue being record' ed from Customs duties, the “ Compounded Road Tax ” and monopoly dues to which the imports of cloth, tea and sugar contribute nearly 50 per cent, it is evident that the system of taxation hits the labourer and the man of the poorer classes most, as the above items constitute his ordinary requirements. On the other hand it is presumed that the land tax falls chiefly on the peasant, who is harassed by unscrupulous subordinates of the Malyieh Depart ment which is not properly supervised in this outly ing and neglected district of Persia. 4. MILITARY. (a) As there were no military operations in the vicinity, no commandering of transport took place. (b) The conduct of the Persian troops on the whole was satisfactory and their presence in the district caused no inconvenience to trade and industry^ (c) The conscription law has not been put into force here. 5. AGRICULTURE. (a) The same conditions described in the last year’s report still obtain. (b) No new crops or new methods of cultivation have been introduced. (c) Whilst there was no requisitioning by the Alimentation service, damage to crops was again done by the ravages of locusts. 6. INDUSTRY. (a), (6) and (c) No new industries have been opened nor has any encouragement been given by the Government in that direction. (d) An influential local Persian merchant has placed an order in Bombay for an electric plant for lighting the town, but it is doubtful whether the enterprise will be made to pay. (e) The Red Oxide of Iron Mines on Hormuz Island continue to be worked satisfactorily. The output of this product amounted to 3,500 tons dur ing the year under record, against 6,500 tons in. the preceding year. The whole of this quantity was shipped to the United Kingdom. No other mines in the district were worked, al though a visit was paid to the adjacent islands by a German Mining Engineer to examine the possibilities of mineral exploitation. During the cold weather a party of Geologists belonging to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company carried out a survey in search of oil, of the country between Bandar Abbas and Lar and in the direction of Shi raz. The result of their labours is not known so far. It is expected that another survey will be made next year of the country between Minab and Rudan and in the Bashakard area. 7. ROADS. (a) and (b) The Kerman-Bandar Abbas road via the Tang-i-Zagh referred to in the last report, was put into repair and made fit for motor traffic, which will probably be inaugurated next near. (Now open to motor traffic.) (c) No forced labour or forced levies were employ ed. (e) The caravan routes were safe on the whole, only three isolated attacks having been reported during the year on the Tang-i-Zandan route. No merchandise was looted during transport to the interior.8. SOCIAL. (a) There has been no improvement in the stand ard of living which has already been described as one of the poorest in the Gulf. (b) Besides the labour required for lighterage and loading and unloading of vessels, the handling of cargo in the Customs House and in the merchants warehouses and fishing in the harbour, no other work is obtainable, and there is always a certain amount of uneipployment. (c) Since the appointment of a Persian Medical Officer in charge of Quarantine and of Public Health, some attention is being paid to sanitation. Ihe streets are now swept and cleared of rubbish and the bazaars have been widened slightly. Venereal disease is, however, still rife. No epidemics have been recorded in this district during the year. A few sporadic cases of influenza were reported to have occurred in the vicinity. The Persian Medical Officer has opened a small dispensary in the Town. (d) The Municipal Committees at Bandar Abbas and Lingah exist but only in name. The local Governor appears to take an interest in Municipal afiairs here, now that a grant of Krans 7,000 month ly is being received on this account from the Central Treasury. (e) There is no appreciable evidence of emigration in sfite of un-employment. The Police authorities here and at Lingah keep a watchful eye on persons desirous of proceeding to the Arab Coast or to foreign parts. During'.the summer months, there is an exodus from this town to Minab for the annual date harvest ing, whilst a good number of the population go to other parts of the interior to attend to their lands. (2) The Strick Line of Steamers, (3) The Ellerman and Bucknall Steamship Company Limited, (4) The Hansa Line Steamers, and (5) The Soviet Mercantile Fleet. 157 steamers aggregating 349,342 tons entered and cleared the port during the Persian year ending 20th March 1929. Of these 149 vessels with a total tonnage of 323,809 were under the British ^ Foreign shipping was represented by vessels of^^&gt; German Hansa Line and the Soviet Mercantile Fleet, of which 6 and 2 vessels with a tonnage of 21,976 and 3,557 respectively entered and cleared the port. Lingah .—The principal lines that called at this port were the British India Steam Navigation Com pany which maintained a weekly service from Bombay on the outward voyage and a fortnightly one on the homeward bound trip and the Hansa Line which sent a ship occasionally. 84 vessels registering an aggregate of 164,435 tons entered and cleared the port. Of these 77 i^ith 137,657 tons were British and the remaining 7 aggregating 26,778 tons were German. FREIGHTS.

TRADE. (a) General Conditions. Trade on the whole may be said to have been dull throughout the year, but there was a slight improve ment during the last six months thereof. As hotice- able at Bandar Abbas, it generally slackens off to a minimum during the hot weather, when the mer chants migrate to the neighbouring Ginau hills and the town assumes a deserted appearance. The total volume of the trade of this district, which for Customs purposes comprises Jask, Charbar, Tiab (port of Minab) and Kishim Island, aggregated Krans 64,748,174 against Krans 69,944,089 for the preceding year. Imports amounting to Krans 47,095,910 of which merchandise valued at Krans 42,302,147 were intro duced through the port of Bandar Abbas itself, showed a falling off of Krans 3,000,000 as compared with those for 1305. As mentioned in previous reports, it is estimated that only about 5 per cent, of the imports is for consumption at this town, the remainder being destined for the interior. The principal articles of the import trade afiected were cotton piece-goods, yarn and sugar especially loaf sugar. These recorded a drop ranging from 4 per cent, for piece-goods, 19 per cent, for soft sugar up to 24 per cent, in the case of loaf sugar. Large quantities of cotton piece-goods, it is pre- g^jjYied, remained in stock at places inland from the previous years. The sugar trade has suffered considerably since the introduction of the monopoly and road taxes, to say nothing of the high customs duties levied as compared to those obtaining at Persian ports in the North. Kerosene Oil. Owing to the greater attention paid during the past few years by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited to the marketing of their products in Persia and the marked improvements effected in refining and packing, American kerosene is fast disappearing from South Persia. The British company which possesses many advantages over American or other foreign producers, namely less freight charges and no customs duty or road taxes to pay, is in a posi tion to offer its products at a very favourable rate to the local consumer. During 1306 it imported 11,691 cases of Kerosene each containing 2 four-gallon tins and held a balance of 5,103 cases in stock from the previous year. Its sales amounted to 11,691 cases as compared with 431 cases sold by the Standard Oil Company of New York trom the stocks lying here. The latter mentioned company has not imported any kerosene oil for the past two or three years. The quality known as “ Palm tree ” is the most popular brand in the local markets. Petrol. In recent years, the frequency of passage of air craft both to and from the East through Bandar Abbas, which is now a popular re-fuelling station, has given a stimulus to the import of petrol and motor spirits, and the maintenance of large stocks of these articles by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 12,180 gallons of Anglo-Persian petrol and aviation spirit were issued to aeroplanes calling here, in addition to about 1,400 gallons of “ Shell ” brand. The Customs do not in their general statistics show kerosene oil and petrol imported by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company from their Abadan refinery, as these come in “ Cabotage ”. The value of these articles is therefore not included in the total value of imports for this district. Exports .—These amounted to Krans 17,652,264 during the year under report, and showed a drop of about 2,000,000 Kranh'.on the previous year’s total. Carpets .—The consignments received from Kerman and other places were valued at Krans 5,136,420 as against Krans 6,861,648 in 1305. Raiv Cotton .—There was a marked improvement to the extent of 56 per cent, on the preceding year.The value of shipments through this port was regis tered at Krans 3,431,211 as compared with Krans 2,197,168 in 1306. Dried Fruits.^—A greater quantity of these was received from the interior and found ready markets in India and the United States of America, especially almonds and pistachio nuts. item of trade, are now fast displacing the superior although more expensive British manufactured article, which at one time monopolised the local market. French and German candles rule the market, having practically ousted the British article which used formerly to be imported from Burmah. TRADE OF THE LINGAH DISTRICT. The figures registered for 1306 continue to show the further decline of trade at this once flourishing port. I The total volume aggregated Krans 7,423,718 as compared with krans 9,901,762 for the preceding year, Representing a decrease of 25 per centum. The imports dropped by 15 per centum and the exports by 47 per centum. Statistical tables in regard to the import and export trade of Bandar Abbas and Lingah respec tively are attached to this report. A table showing the caravan routes leading to the principal centres of trade in the interior with a list of transport rates obtaining during the year is also appended. {b) and (c) There has bfeen no new trade nor were any new trade channels observed during the year. (d) Although sugar as found in these markets is a foreign grown product, its import was practically the foremost activity of the Hindu merchants of Bandar Abbas. The trade in that Commodity was somewhat Seriously affected by the appearance of Russian sugar in towns as far South as Yezd and Kerman. Hindu importers were not a little embar rassed by Russian competition. The situation grew worse at the end of the year by reports spread that a Russian steamer carrying Russian sugar was expected at Bushire. No Russian sugar, however, has been imported through ports in this district during the year. (e) It is unusual to find business done under credit, as most shipments are covered by bills with docu ments against payment. Firms in Manchester, however, do at times send out piece-goods under D/A bills (documents against acceptance). ( It is interesting to note the particularly business like efforts of some German firms, whose invoices, etc., are accompanied by a translation in Persian for the convenience of the importer. (/) German sporting guns and ammunition are gaining popularity, solely due to cheapness of price. German cartridges, although not a very important British Trade. f* In spite of the decrease in trade generally, as observed elsewhere in this report it may be of interest to know that 77£ per cent, of the total imports into the district came from the United Kingdom and India. Manchester and India also predominate as regards the trade in Cotton piece-goods. Their combined contribution towards the total value of imports in this line during the year exceeded 93 per cent. British made bicycles with Dunlop tyres find more favour in the local market than those of foreign manufacture, although a fair number of German inner tubes appear to be in use. (g) Except perhaps in the case of a single indivi dual, who happens to be the most influential and wealthy merchant in the district, there is no over trading generally. (h) The commercial morality of local firms, in the opinion of the Bank Manager, is of a rather high standard. In spite of the dullness of the legiti mate trade, there has been very little tendency towards speculation. 2. FINANCIAL. (а) Throughout the year money has been easy and at times rather plentiful. The average selling rates quoted by the Imperial Bank of Persia during the year were Krans 50*37 per £1 Sterling. Krans 373*68 per Rs. 100. Maximum and minimum rates during the same year were — Krans 53*50 and Krans 47*75 per £1 Sterling. Krans 387 and Rrans 354 per Rs. 100. (б) It is known that the bulk of the capital of the principal merchant in this district is invested abroad, but principally in shares in British Shipping and Commercial Companies and in British, banks. (c) There have been no bankruptcies of any importance, only one or two small shop-keeper* having failed during the year.3 3. TAXATION. (a) High customs duties and exorbitant tolls under the name of “ Compounded Road Taxes ” have undoubtedly restricted purchasing powers in this district as in other parts of Persia. Moreover, they have driven the once flourishing import trade of Lingah to the Arabian shores of the^ilf incidentally brought Dubai on the opposite coast into prominence as a commercial port. (b) Incidence of Taxation.—The Principal sources 6f revenue being derived from customs duties, the road taxes and monopoly duos, to which the imports of cloth, tea and sugar into the district contribute to a considerable extent, it is clear that the system of taxation hits the working man most, as the above articles constitute his ordinary requirements. On the other hand, it is presumed that a fair proportion of the land taxes falls on the peasant, who receives no ‘ quid pro quo ’ from the Govern ment in the shape of state irrigation schemes, etc, (c) No special comment is called for, other than that whether he gets a good harvest or not and irrespective of the incidence of drought, famine and epidemics, the small cultivator is called upon to pay the usual taxes due to the Government, failing which his lands are confiscated. 4. MILITARY. (а) No military operations were undertaken in district recently and in consequence there has been no commandeering of transport during the year under review. (б) The conduct of the Persian troops on the whole has been satisfactory. Owing to the fact of the issue of rations and of the receipt of their salaries more regularly, no cases of looting of the bazaars as formerly or interference with trade have been brought to notice. (c) The conscription law has, so far, not been put into force in this district. 5. AGRICULTURE. (a) No record of the area under cultivation is kept by the Malieh department, but it is most reticent to furnish any information whatever. It is therefore not possible to obtain any figures in this respect eveti'from private sources. The principal areas under cultivation are situated in the Bhamil, Minab and Kishar districts. {b) As far as can be ascertained, no new crops have been introduced. Agricultural machinery is unknown, and the methods employed are very primitive. (c) There was no requisitioning on tfie part of the alimentary service, but considerable damage was done to the crops by the invasion of locusts during the year. {d) Irrigation is effected through the usual 4 jub or local canal system, but for lack of means except in the case of one or two of the richer landlords ‘ qanats ’ are not employed. Water may be said to have been fairly plentiful, as the annual rainfall in the interior was normal. (e) A fair proportion of the cultivated land, especially in the Shamilat and Biyaban areas, is hypothecated and is in the hands of wealthy land lords at Bandar Abbas and Minab. (/) No opium is grown in this District. 6. INDUSTRY. (a) and (b) While no pew industries have been opened, the boat building industry long established at Kishim Island and at Lingah have received a set-back owing to the introduction of the com pounded road taxes since 1926. The taxes on timber and iron were found prohibitive and are causing this once famous industry to disappear gradually and betake itself to the Arabian ports of the Gulf. (c) No encouragement is given nor can such be expected on the part of the Government to indus trial undertakings of apy sort. On the contrary, heavy taxation and irksome .customs and other regulations appear to be driving both trnde and industry from this district. (d) Electricity is unknown here. The local Persian departments are very eager .to enjoy the advantages of electric light and fans in their offices, but the Government is backward to make a move in this direction. Efforts are being made to induce an influential Persian merchant to erect an electric plant in the town but the latter is reluctant to lay out the initial expenditure as it is very doubtful that the enter prise would eventually be made to pay. For some years past, the same merqhaut has run an ice machine in the town without success. This was due chiefly to the fact of the local officials not paying for ice but expecting to obtain their require ments gratis. (e) Deyelojpemnt of mines.—The working of the Red Oxide of Iron mines on Hormuz Island, leased by the Persian Government to a rich merchant at Tehran, has been carried on fairly consistentlv.1 » i 4 The output amounted to 6,535 tons, which is a narked improvement on that of the preceding &gt;ear. This product which is of a high grade was exported ; o the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States of America in equal quantities. The arrangements for handling and shipment of Red Oxide of Iron from Hormuz are not satisfactory, there being no crane or jetty on the island and no proper means of transport from the mines which are situated about three miles from the place on the sea shore where it is loaded on to steamers. There are salt mines on the Kishim Island ^hich at one time used to supply the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s refinery at Abadan. There appearb havebeen no demand for salt during the past three or four years from that quarter and the mines are not now being worked. The wages of the daily unskilled labourer in the town or in the field rarely exceeds two Krans per diem. The staple diet of the poorer classes consists of dried salted fish and dates. The exorbitant customs duties and other taxes recently introduced have tended to deprive the . working man of the ordinary cup of tea so com^Viiy indulged in in better days. (b) There being very little work obtainable out side fishing, lighterage for ships, labour for handling cargo on board and in the Customs House, a con siderable amount of unemployment naturally re sults. During the summer months when local trade slackens^ there is a big exodus of the population to places in the interior, especially to Minab for the date harvest. 7. ROADS. (a) and (6) There are no roads worthy of that name, in this district. The Bandar Abbas section of the road leading to Kerman, constructed by the British mditary forces during the Great War, extends inland for about forty miles from the old military cantonment of Naiband, and has long since been allowed to fall into dis repair. The Persian Government have now proposed to put this section in order and to link it up with Kerman via the Tang-i-Zagh. In November 1927 work was begun at the Kerman end ^here about a hundred miles of the old road were tolerably fit for motor traffic, but operations were afterwards sus pended for want of funds. It was said that the budget grant voted for the purpose by the Persian Majliss was re-appropriated for road construction elsewhere in Persia. (c) No labour was requisitioned here for road construction in the Kerman area. (d) No remarks are called for as motor transport does not obtain in this district, where no roads fit for such traffic exist. (e) Two of the main caravan routes leading to the interior were temporarily rendered unsafe during the year, owing to the inadequacy of the strength of the Amnieh posts en route and were subjected to the depredations of Bashakardi highwaymen. It was necessary to apply to the military authorities for assistance in guarding the roads. 8. SOCIAL. (c) Public Health and Hygiene .—No sanitary de partment has ever been established here and no attention is paid to public health and hygiene. Venereal disease is rife. It is estimated that about 75 per cent, of the population are infected with this loathsome malady in some form or other. Small-pox is endemic throughout the district, and malaria abounds. A severe epidemic of cholera broke out at the village of Minab in August 1927 and soon spread to the outlying villages. The total mortality from the disease was estimated at between 4,000 and 5 , 000 . A mission of Persian Medical Officers with ample supplies of anti-choleric vaccine was despatched to the afiected areas. Thanks to the energetic preventive measures adopted by the British Quarantine Doctor of this port, cholera was successfully warded off Bandar Abbas town. In October of the same year, cholera in an epidemic form appeared at Lingah and claimed between 200 and 300 victims. It is remarkable that the district does not possess a single Persian hospital or dispensary.^ Medical relief to the inhabitants is afiorded by Charitable Dispensaries at Bandar Abbas and Lingah estab lished under the aegis of the Government of India and practically maintained by it. A British Medical Officer is attached to each of the above-mentioned institutions. (a) The standard of living in general in this dis trict may be described as being of the lowest, the inhabitants perhaps constituting the poorest classes to be found in the Persian Gulf. (d) Municipal Committees exist but only in name, at Bandar Abbas and Lingah, the affairs of the department being entirely in the hands of the Governor.5 f it cannot properly be said that any services are rendered to the communities concerned. The conditions existing in the towns are repulsive and intolerable. Nearly every house or hut has a well swarming with mosquitoes. The covered-in bazaars are barely swept if at all and bestrewn with filth. A poor attempt is made to light some of the so- c*m streets. The advice tendered by the British Quarantine Medical Officer on sanitary matters has invariably fallen on deaf ears. (e) There is no appreciable evidence of emigration from Bandar Abbas, but such is more marked at Lingah and its surrounding districts. A consider able number of traders and others from Lar and Bastak have settled permanently at Dubai and places on the Arabian Coast. SHIPPING AND NAVIGATION. Bandar Abbas :—The principal steamship lines which called at Bandar Abbas were as follows :— (1) The British India Steam Navigation Com pany Limited. (2) The Strick Line of steamers. (3) The Ellerman and Bucknall Steam Ship Company, Limited. (4) The Hansa Line Steamers. 142 steamers aggregating Tons 318,372 entered and cleared the port during the Persian year ending 20th March 1928. Of these 137 vessels with a total tonnage of 299,369 were under the British flag. Foreign shipping was represented solely by the German Hansa Line of which 5 ships with a tonnage of 19,013 entered and cleared the port. Lingah :—The principal lines that called at this port were the British India Steam Navigation Com pany which maintained a weekly service from Bombay on the outward voyage and a fortnightly one on the homeward bound trip, and the Hansa Line which sent a ship occasionally. 86 vessels registering an aggregate of 175,753 tons entered and cleared the port. Of these 80 with 153,972 tons were British and the remaining 6 aggre gating 21,781 tons were German. FREIGHTS. Freights ruling during the year were as follows :— To Bombay— Rs. A. P.

Towards the latter portion of the year the Persian Government pro hibited commercial transactions in Indian currency and placed an embargo on the export of Indian silver. Nevertheless, a certain amount of business continued to be transacted in Rupees and these coins were smuggled out of the country. During the year, the Imperial Bank of Persia again assisted the Persian Government in the clearance from circulation of defective coin. The currency of this part of Persia has, in consequence, impro\ed eon- siderablv and it is estimated that a quantity exceeding 6,000,000 debased Krans has been collected by the local Branch of the Bank and despatched to Tehran to be reminted.

The description of the town and its inhabitants has been given in the report for the year 1304 (1925-1926) and does not need repetition here. As mentioned previously Bandar Abbas merely serves as a gateway of commerce for the Hinter land of South Eastern Persia, the town itself barely taking up 5 per cent, of the imports that are landed in the port. Landing Arrangements. There has been no change to report except that at the end of the year the extension of the Customs jetty had almost been completed. Trade Routes. Tables ‘A’ to ‘E’ appended give details of the principal commercial routes between Bandar Abbas and other centres and the transport rates prevailing during the year under review. The roads were open for caravan traffic and were comparatively safe, except during the last month of the year. Trade. Statistical tables in respect of Bandar Abbas and Lingah, based on the figures furnished by the Persian Customs Department are appended to this Report for the Persian years 1303, 1304 and 1305 corresponding to the years 1924-25,1925-26 and 1926- 1927, respectively. To total volume of trade at Bandar Abbas during those years was as follows :— £ 1924- 25 ...... 1,860,718 1925- 26 . . ... . . 1,692,508 1926- 27 1,439,072 The above figures show a decline of £253,436 during 1926-27 from the preceding year, principally due to the stringent operation of the Monopoly and Compounded Road Tax enactments that have been in force now for the past two years. Lingah Trade. The total volume of trade was as below :— £ 1924- 25 368,407 1925- 26 308;098 1926- 27 207,257 Here a more considerable decline in trade is noticeable, attributable to the same causes as at Bandar Abbas. The enforcement of the Monopoly and Road Taxes has had a more detrimental effect and has driven the trade to the opposite shores of .the Persian Gulf where a very fair proportion of its population has emigrated and from whence a considerable quantity of merchandise, specially commodities affected by the above-mentioned taxes are debarked surreptitiously from sailing craft at the numerous adjacent anchorages and despatched to places in the interior which were formerly sup plied by Lingah. The Road Taxes have in particular badly hit the once famous boat-building industry at this port. Imports. These show a decrease of £186,917 at Bandar Abbas as compared with 1925-26. Both such from United Kingdom and India especially the former fell somewhat during the year, whereas the value of imports from Germany and Japan records an increase- of £11,703 and £20,978 respectively. Cotton Pitcegocds. The statistics furnished by the Customs House show a decrease in this line as emanating from India and the United Kingdom to the extent of £87,051 but it is possible that this difference was due to large unsold stocks remaining in the interior and a smaller demand from the Kerman market. At the same time owing to the standstill of British trade in general for the greater part of the year on account of the coal strike in England, shipments were fewer./ 2 In the circumstances, demands were made on Germany, and Japan for the supply of these articles, in view of their being cheaper. Cotton Yarn. There was a decided improvement in the import from India, United Kingdom and Japan attributable to the tendency to over expansion of the carpet industry in the Kerman district. Dried Fruits. Following a plentiful harvest at Minab, there was an appreciable increase in the export of dates but a considerable fall in that of almonds and pista chios for which there were poor markets in India and Japan. Walnuts on the other hand found a ready sale ip India and showed an increase in value ^o the extent of £10,891. r Raw Cotton. Sugar, The demand for both loaf and soft sugar, owing to the high Customs duty coupled with the pro hibitive Monopoly and Road Taxes, continued to fall showing a decrease of 31 per cent, and 68 per cent, from the imports for 1925-26 and 1924-25, respectively, .... Belgium was the principal country adversely affected in respect of loaf sugar and Holland (Java) as regards soft sugar, Tea, In spite of the Monopoly Tax, the Persian in habitants have found it impossible to forego this essential article of consumption and the iipport figures show only an insignificant decline. Exports. Bandar Abbas, The total value of exports was less by £66,590 as compared with 1925-26, and as in the case of imports was due to the imposition of the Road Taxes causing Oman to purchase her requirements fn adjacent and more favourable piarkets on the Arabian Coast. There, was an appreciable decrease in exports *0 India and the United Kingdom, Carpets. Although the more favoured route for the des patch of these abroad is through Duzdap, the value of consignments of carpets shipped at Bandar Abbas was £20,444 in excess of the preceding year. Red Oxide of Iron. This product which is mined at the neighbouring Island of Hormuz was apparently not in much demand in the European and American markets, and the export dropped from 6,519 tons in 1925-26 to 2,857 in the year gnder report. There was a fall of £22,953 from the export for 1925-26 and may be attributed to the fact of its unsuitability for the Indian Mills and of a greater quantify being taken up for local consumption. • ‘J * Lingah. *' The export trade of Lingah is fast disappearing. In the year under Review the total value of its ex ports was 23 per cent, less than that of the preceding year and 53 per cent, less than that for the year 1924-25. The only items of any importance are specie and pearly. Specie. This consists mainly of silver rupees remitted to Bahrein and places on the Arab Coast for the purchase of sugar, tea, etc. These commodities are afterwards introduced in contraband. Pearls. These are exported to the Bombay market. While it js cpmmonly said that the once flourishing pearling industry is practically dead, the total value of pearls exported registered a slight increase for the year. Shipping and Navigation. Bandar Abbas .—The principal steam ship lines which called at Bandar Abbas were as follows :— ( 1 ) The British India Steam Navigation Com pany, Limited. (2) Thg Strick Line of Steamers. (3) The Elleiman and Bucknall Steam Ship Company, and (4) The Hansa Line. 180 steamers aggregating Tons 555,366 entered and cleared the port during the year 1926. Of these 168 vessels with a total tonnage of 419,734 were under the British flag. Foreign shipping was represented solely by the Geiman Hansa Line of which 12 ships with a tonnage of 35,632 entereq and cleared the port.m 16 TABLE 1-G— contd.

English Sovereigns are practically unobtainable. Not a little confusion arose during the year owing to the considerable quantity of defaced and sweated* Persian coins in circulation in the neighbouring districts being imported into the town. The Persian Government promulgated an order calling in all defaced Krans within the period of one year. These were exchanged by the local branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia, collected and sent to Tehran to be re-minted. Exchange. — Exchange per £. 1. 1924-25. 1925-26. Maximum ............

Avoir. 0 010229 Ibsi 6-60 „ * 13 00 ' 000I Report on the Trade and Commerce of the District of Bandar Abbas for the Persian Official Year 1304 (March 21st, ^ 1925 to March 20th, 1926) by Mr. G. A. Richardson, O. B. E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul. Gen 1 Bandar Abbas is situated at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, at the head of a bay ; across this bay stretch the three Islands of Hormuz, Larak and Kishim, forming a natural breakwater to the port. The town consists of a straggling collection of houses built of sun-dried bricks and extends for about miles along the beach. From the town diverge the various routes leading into the interior which give Bandar Abbas its real importance, and upon the security of which its prosperity and trade depend. A very small proportion of the imports, barely exceeding five per cent are actually consumed in the place itself ; the bulk of these is forwarded inland to Kerman, Yezd, Lar and other distributing centres. Bandar Abbas may be described as being merely the gate-way of commerce for South Eastern Persia. The population is roughly estimated at 15,000, no official census ever having been taken. The better class merchants are of Persian origin but the working classes more specially the sea-faring communities are of a mixed strain and as in the case of the inhabitants on both littorals of the Gulf, the negroid element predominates. During the summer months, almost two-third 8 of the population migrate, the merchants to the neighbouring Ginau Hills and most of the remainder to Minab to participate in the date harvest. The official language is Persian but there is a j growing tendency to learn English. The inhabitants speak a conglomerate dialect known as Bandari in which traces of Baluchi, Arabic, Persian and bwahili can be discerned. The British Colony consists of 20 Khojas and 50 to 60 Hindus from Shikarpur. Landing Arrangements. There is no port in the ordinary acceptation of the word, but only a very shallow and open road stead, somewhat protected on account of the Islands. There are neither lights nor wharves and owing to the shallowness of the water, Vessels are com pelled to anchor about a mile and a half or two miles out. A buoy in 5 fathoms at low tide and maintained by the Royal Indian* Marine authorities marks the best anchorage about 2£ miles from the shore at the nearest point slightly East of the British Consulate and nearly 3| miles from the Customs Pier. Some of the smaller ships, however, anchor opposite the town as it is more convenient for dis charging cargo. The various shipping agents main tain a dozen sailing dhows which are used as lighters for transporting cargo from ship to shore and vice versa. The process of landing goods is very slow and more so when a dead calm prevails. Moreover^ owing to lighters only being able to go alongside the short masonry pier for about four hours a day, further delay is experienced by ships in discharging their cargoes and specially when more than one vessel is operating in the port at the same time. This delay added to the fact of the Customs Pier not being lighted at night, affords ample opportunity for tampering with the cargo in the lighters and pilferage has been reduced to a fine art in Bandar Abbas. The above facts are important factors militating against trade and commerce at this port where goods whilst lying on the pier are further subjected to deterioration through exposure to rain and sun and adverse climatic conditions generally. It is extremely remarkable that in view of the several thousand tons of cargo dealt with annually, there has been no proper pierf in the port. The system described in previous reports of hand ling goods after being landed, and the process of passing them through the Customs House by the Hamal Bashi is still in vogue. No improvement of the conditions under which merchandise is stored in the Customs was observed during the year under review. The accommodation * N jw by the Iraqian Port Directorate at Basra. t The Customs Pier is now being extended.2 — 1 nf« is totally inadequate and not a little confusion pre vailed as heretofore. Owing to the imposition of the monopoly taxes cm tea and sugar in May 1925 there was a big demand amongst importers for Customs bonded warehouses. Trade Routes. Goods after being cleared from the Customs and having reached the consignee’s warehouse are des patched to the interior, chiefly by camel transport. All caravans start from a particular spot on the outskirts of the town. Tables ‘ A ’ to ‘ E ’ attached to this report give details of the various trade routes between Bandar Abbas and other centres, and of the transport rates prevailing during the period under review. It is interesting to note that owing to the establish ment of the Amnieh (Road Guards) between Bandar Abbas and its principal centre, Kerman, there was a marked improvement in the state of the caravan traffic and the roads were comparatively safe through out the year. Trade. Statistical tables in respect of Bandar Abbas and Lingah, based on the figures furnished by the local Customs Department, are appended to this Report, and relate to the Persian years 1302, 1303 and 1304 which correspond to the years 1923-24, 1924-25 and 1925-26 respectively. The total volume of trade during those years was as follows :— £ 1923- 24 1,603,070 1924- 25 1,860,718 1925- 26 1,692,508 It will be seen that trade in general for the year under report although showing a slight improvement on that of 1923-24, received a set back from the preceding year. This was due to the general trade depression obtaining throughout Persia, decline in the export of opium and other contributory causes, the chief of which being the introduction of the monopoly taxes and, towards the end of the year, of the Compounded Road Tax levied on merchandise imported or exported. Imports. These whilst showing an increase of £91,898 over the imports for the year 1923-24, declined by £132,520 as compared with the preceding year. The imports from the United Kingdom according to the Customs House statistics fell from £ 459,190 in 1924-25 to £ 295.248 thus representing a de crease of £ 163,742. Too great an importance need not be attached to these figures, since a considerable quantity of merchandise from the United Kingdom which is transhipped at Karachi and Bombay i 3 included in the imports from India. On the other hand imports from the latter tioned country show an increase of £188,199 in 1925-26 over those in 1924-25. Germany registered a slight but steady improve ment in its import trade in this district. Cotton Piecegocds. This is the most important item of commerce in the district constituting 34% of the total import. The United Kingdom (Manchester) and India have a practical monopoly of the local markets in this line and contributed 96% of the total value of goods imported under this head. The value of cotton piecegoods imported from Manchester during 1925-26 is shown in the Customs statistics as £228,429, but it is assumed that a certain proportion introduced by transhipment in India is included in the imports of that country. similarly, Italian and Japanese piecegoods, owing to indirect shipment, are occasionally classified as being of Indian origin. In spite of the increased import, the piecegoods trade was somewhat slack owing to frequent fluc tuations and rapid fall of prices. As a consequence, the market was overstocked at the end of the year. Cotton Yarn. This is of equal importance in the import trade. As in the case of cotton piecegoods, the bulk of the commodity comes from the United Kingdom. Al- !noo^ t ^ le va ^ ue th 6 import under this head in V* 23 ' 24 was £127,816, and £204,970 in 1924-25, the figures for the year under report is shewn as eing only £46,237 whereas that for India for the sar,le period is £ 220,590. This is evidently a mis take and due to faulty classification in the Customs statistical Department. Business in the above line being chiefly in the nands of British Indian traders, cotton yarn imported rom Manchester is generally transhipped at ihe ports of Bombay and Karachi.3 (o5 Sugar. The import of both loaf and soft sugar has decrease^ considerably during the year 1925-26, being about 46% below the value of that for the preceding two years. This marked difference is attributable to the imposition of the monopoly tax on that commo dity since May 1925. ^^ er theless, sugar being one of the most essen tial articles of consumption of the local population, large quantities were smuggled into the country through the numerous outlying ports at which there are no Customs Houses established. Belgium occupies the most predominant position in the import trade of loaf sugar in this district; similarly, Java supplies nearly all the soft sugar. Exports. There was a slight decline in the total value of exports, as compared with the figures for 1923-24 and 1924-25. India is the principal buyer of Persian produce, and took up 54% of the total exports. The United States of America, Oman and the United Kingdom follow in the order in which they are given. Carpets. These are chiefly manufactured in the province of Kerman and form the most important item of export, representing 24% of the total value. Rugs and carpets are mostly destined for the United States of America that purchased to the extent of £ 104 193 against £5,347 by the United Kingdom. Red Oxide of Iron. This product mined at the Island of Hormuz shows an increase of 64% over the quantity exported during the preceding year. 6,519 tons of Red Ox!de valued at £ 21,990 were exported, the bulk of which went to the United Kingdom, solely in British bottoms. } Dried Fruits. The export was less by 24% as compared with the figures for 1924.26, owing to a bad harvest in the fruit growing districts and a smaller demand in India which is the biggest buyer. Cotton. Another important item of export, showed an appreciable decrease during the year under review, owing to dislocation of the Indian markets and to a greater demand for local consumption. Shipping and Navigation. The principal steamship lines which called at Bandar Abbas were, viz. :— ( o) The British India Steam Navigation Co.» Ltd., maintained its weekly passenger, cargo and mail service regularly from Bombay and Basra respectively. . (6) The Strick Line of Steamers (Frank C. Strick &amp; Co., Ltd., London) sent 24 vessels during 1925-26 with cargo from the United Kingdom and Continental ports. (c) The Ellerman and Bucknall Steamship Line. Seven steamers brought cargo from the United Kingdom, calling en route at Antwerp. (d) The Hansa Line inaugurated a tri-monthly service to the Persian Gulf in March 1924. Four steamers visited this port during 1925-26 landing cargo from Ham burg and Antwerp. The freight rates ruling during the year 1925-26 were as follows :— To Bombay — Pistachios and almonds (in bags of 180- 200 pounds) . . Dried fruits (Raisins, fig% etc., in bags) Cotton (in bales of 10 cwt.) Carpets (bales of 10 cwt.) . To Karachi — Pistachios and almonds Dried Dates Cotton Bales . To London — Carpets . Almonds and Raisins 46 shillings per ton. 33 shillings and six pence, per ton. 11 shillings per ton. 32 shillings and six pence, per ton. 42 shillings per ton. 29 shillings per ton. 13 shillings and six pence per ton. 100 shillings per ton. 110 shillings per ton. 812 TABLE 2-A—EXPORT.
