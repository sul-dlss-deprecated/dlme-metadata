By shutting their Legation here, the Soviet Government will lose nothing whatever except slight propaganda value of their *doctor*. 1. They have no '‘’subjects'’ here and owing to anti-religious and financial causes they never have any pilgrims. 2. They have collected money the Saudi-Arabian Government owe them. 5 o Since publication of instructions directed mainly against Italian propaganda (my despatch No. 8 dated 17th January) the members of the Soviet Legation have been unable to maintain their close contact with local people. 4. The Legation has long been little more than a^ transla tion bureau whence news and opinions collected from Arab news papers in Near and Middle hast could be sene to Moscow. I imagine Soviet move has more to do with Spain and the United Front and so on than with Saudi-Arabia buc these matters are outside my competence.

After a period of inaction he seems to have indulged in violent anti-British propaganda and lost no opportunity of preaching the mission of the Soviet Union to liberate the East. His activities caused some concern to the authorities in Egypt and the Sudan and his Majesty’s high Commissioner in Cairo suggested that it might be advisable to approach Ibn Saud with a view to the suppression of the Soviet Agency. The Acting British Agent, however, expressed the view that M. Khakimov’s propaganda was ineffective, 9 that his drunkenness and general behaviour were such as to warn off all but the most stupid and that it would therefore be inadvisable to act on the high Commissioner’s suggestion. M. Khakimov left Jedda on leave in October 1927. In reporting his departure, Mr. Consul Stonehewer-Bird stated that it was unlikely that he would return. he was unfit to stand the climate and was unable to do anything in moderation. he either drank himself into a nervous break down or was a teetotaller. Owing to the mishandling of a Soviet trade '’push'* by the Charg4 d’Affaires, M. Khakimov was recalled to Jedda in February 1928. he was worried and depressed over the lackr\ O lack of success of his mission and was very hitter against His Majesty 1 s Government* He finally left in October and passed through Jedda again in June 1929, on his way to the Yemen, where he had been appointed Soviet commercial representative* He returned to Russia from the Yemen in January 1932*THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’ S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 980/980/25] No. 1. ii- Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received February 12.) (No. 27.) Sir, Jedda, January 29, 1935. WITH reference to my despatch No. 92 of the 23rd March, 1933, regarding the relations between the Saudi Arab Government and the Soviet, I have the honour to state that a Soviet official named Guertik has been attached for com mercial work to the Soviet Legation here for three or four weeks past. I gathered at first that he might be a permanent addition to the staff, but it now seems more likely that he will not stay long and is merely on a tour of inspection. This is borne out by a statement in the Aden Intelligence Report for the fortnight ending the 2nd January that he is expected at Hodeida shortly. He is there described as “ inspector-general of Russian oil business.” 2. The following is a summary of an account given of M. Guertik by the local manager of Messrs. Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited) : He appeared to be agreeable, unaggressive and less reserved than many Soviet officials. He disclaimed any idea of launching a commercial offensive and declared : ‘ c Je ne veux pas la lutte.” He discussed with Mr. Black the position in regard to certain staple imports here and appeared to recognise that in some lines, e.g., sugar and petrol, the Soviet trading organisations would find it difficult to compete in Saudi Arabia at present prices. M. Guertik seemed to be interested in the marketing of Soviet manufactured goods and actually sounded Mr. Black as to whether Gellatly, Hankey and Co. (Sudan) (Limited) would accept an agency for their sale. 3. It may be worth mentioning that another Russian commercial expert named Kondrachoff recently visited Jedda. He is a member of the Soviet Agency in the Yemen and stayed here only a short time, awaiting an opportunity of proceeding to Russia via Port Sudan. 4. Apart from the above facts, I have observed no recent signs of any special activity on the part of the Russian Legation here. The Soviet Government may, however, be planning a fresh commercial campaign and there have been some indications of a desire on the part of the Legation to cultivate relations with the powerful Saudi Minister of Finance. On the other hand, there was a story last October that the Soviet Minister gave as one reason for hesitating to commit himself to a ten years’ contract for a house the possibility that his Government might at any time abolish his post. 5. I take the opportunity of mentioning that the personnel of the Soviet Legation, not including M. Guertik, is now composed as follows :— 1 Nezir Turakoulov, Minister, Moslem, with a non-Moslem wife. Shakir Ismailoff, Moslem, with wife, possibly Moslem. Dr. Toukov-Rowanski, doctor, with wife, non-Moslems. Morsen, dentist. 6.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 66 of the 28th February last relative to an alleged agreement between the Saudi Government and the Soviet, I have the honour to state that I asked Fuad Bey Hamza on the 18th March whether he could tell me how matters stood. I explained that I felt encouraged to ask him for any information which he could properly give, because the Saudi Mission had taken His Majesty’s Government into their confidence in London last May, and because I preferred to get news from him rather than from the bazaars, where various rumours had been circulating. I reminded Fuad Bey that His Majesty’s Government had defined their own attitude last year in a way which showed that they did not stand in the way of any agreement between this country and Soviet Russia, and that after my return to Jedda, the King had shown further confidence in His Majesty’s Government by sending me a message explaining his position. 2. Fuad Bey said that the Saudi Mission had been approached when in Moscow. The Russians wanted, I understood him to say, three things—a removal of the embargo on trade from Russia to Saudi Arabia, a treaty of friendship and a commercial treaty. They had expressed readiness to accommodate the Saudi Government on terms of short or of long credit. Fuad Bey did not go into details of what these alternatives meant, but I gathered that the Soviet authorities had proposed arrangements (presumably for a loan in the form of goods to be supplied on credit) for a long period of years, and that the Saudi Government were unwilling to commit themselves for more than say three years. 3. Fuad Bey admitted that, following on the Moscow conversations, there had been a renewal of negotiations here, but said that only one thing had been agreed, viz., the removal of the embargo on trade. This removal had not, however, yet become effective, as the Soviet Government had undertaken not to ship goods until the authorities here had had time to organise selling arrangements. 4. Fuad Bey referred back to the petroleum products transaction of 1931. He said that in that year the Soviet Government were already pressing for a removal of the embargo on trade, and that the King, feeling unable at that time to give them satisfaction, had sanctioned the particular transaction to show that his attitude was not due to ill will. Fuad Bey made no mention of any arrange ment to pay off the debt in respect of the goods supplied in 1931 by remitting duty on goods to be imported under the recent arrangement. 5. My conversation with Fuad Bey took place at a moment when I was much taken up with matters of more immediate concern to me. I cannot, there fore, reproduce it as accurately as I would wish, but I think I have got the essential facts right is the above summary. He asked me to treat what he was telling me as confidential, and I undertook to do this. 6.

M ■it’.. » ch 21, 1933. Section 2. No. 1. yl. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 21.) (No. 66.) Sir, Jedda, February 28 , 1933. IN his telegram No. 2, Saving, of the 24th February, Mrr Hope tlill reported briefly on an alleged commercial understanding arrived at between the Saudi Government and the Soviet during my recent absence from Jedda. So much secrecy has been observed regarding the negotiations, that I can add little at present to the telegraphic report as regards the actual facts. The following particulars are, however, worth recording :— 2. There were two main factors in the position between Ibn Saud and Soviet Russia last year, as follows :— (a) The Russians had supplied in the latter part of 1931 benzine and petroleum to the value of some £30,000 and had received no payment. (b) It was understood in the spring and early summer of 1932 that the Russian Minister was endeavouring to negotiate a general agreement with the Soviet Government which at that time seemed to turn on the possibility of the Soviet accommodating Ibn Saud with goods rather than money, in return for a removal of the embargo on direct Russian imports into the Hejaz, which, though it had become to some extent ineffective, still greatly hampered Russian trade. I would refer more particularly to the correspondence ending with my printed ' « despatch No. 255 of the 20th June last. Ip C /$ 2. 3. The negotiations conducted by M. Turacoulov last year seem to have •/ &lt;*$ produced no result. HeNwought off the deal reported by Mr. Hope Gill, using as a lever the claim at \a) in the previous paragraph. It is affirmed that the \ Soviet Minister has secured a partial or total removal of the embargo, in return for an arrangement whereby the old debt to his Government will be met by a partial or total remission of the customs duty on the new goods to be imported. What is not clear is whether what is contemplated is a permanent removal of the embargo or only its removal to the extent of allowing the importation of a quantity of goods such that the agreed remission of duty will suffice to pay off the old debt. The new goods are apparently to be sold on the market, but nothing has been revealed as to the selling machinery to be set up. There is a conflict of information as to whether the Saudi Government have made any preliminary arrangements with their own merchants. According to one account, a deputation of Jedda merchants were consulted during a recent visit to Mecca. According to another version, rather better supported, they were summoned to Mecca in connexion with the proposed national bank, on which I am reporting separatelv, and were left to discover from their own sources in Jedda how matters stood with the Soviet Legation. 4. Whatever the true facts and the dimension of the deal, it has alreadv created a good deal of 'excitement in commercial circles here. It is understood that among the goods to be imported from Russia are flour and sugar, the intro- I duction of which into the market will hit trade with other countries, includins: ■ Australia, which has of late been an important supplier of flour, and India, which has done an important, though latterly declining, general trade with the Hejaz. I hear no definite mention of petroleum products in connexion with the arrange ment with Russia. It seems unlikely that they would be excluded, but the Saudi Government may be unwilling to commit themselves or their merchants to bringing more Russian benzine, &amp;c., at present, having regard to their position vis-d-vis of Shell and American interests. 5. It is worth noting that the Russian Minister’s negotiations last year seemed to be conducted largely with the Minister of Finance, whereas the recent arrangement is said to have been made with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. [739 x—2]As you are aware, there is constant antagonism between the Minister of Finance and the two highest personages concerned with foreign affairs, viz., the Amir Feisal and Fuad Bey Hamza. According to secret sources of information, there is some reason to think that the Minister of Finance may attempt to hamper the Russian trade by devious methods, but this can only be a matter of speculation at present. 6.

He was met at the frontier by officials of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and was greeted by brass bands which, according to the press, ‘ c played the Internationale and various Arabian airs.” On his arrival in Moscow, where the station was decorated with bunting inscribed with Arabic expressions of welcome, the Emir was received by Comrade Krestinski among other officials, and by the Persian Ambassador. 2. The Emir’s visit followed the usual programme provided for State guests considered to belong to the second category of importance. He was received by Kalinin, the president of the Central Executive Committee, on the day of his arrival and a dinner and reception in his honour were given by the Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs in the evening. Members of the Diplomatic Corps were invited to the reception. Before leaving for Leningrad on the 2nd June, the Emir met Comrades Molotov and Kuibyshev among other Soviet notables, while the visits paid by him included an inspection of the “ October ” military camp, and of an aeroplane factory in Moscow. The Emir and his suite returned to Moscow on the 5th June and left in the evening for Constantinople, whither he was accompanied by the head of the Protocol Department of the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. 3. The speeches which were made during the visit appear to have been confined to an exchange of the usual courtesies. No great prominence has been given to the visit in the press. On the day of his arrival, however, the Vc Izvestiya ” published a leading article summarising the post-war history of Hejaz and Nejd, and in particular their relations with the U.S.S.R. This article was an unembroidered account of facts unaccompanied by socialistic ideology, and emphasised that the Soviet Union was the first Power to recognise the Government of Ibn Sand.

It largely consists of copies of correspondence received by the Foreign Office from His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan, succeeded by Sir Reader William Bullard) regarding Saudi-Soviet relations and the activities of Soviet representatives in Saudi Arabia. Other prominent correspondents include His Majesty's Chargé d'Affaires to Jedda (Cecil Gervase Hope Gill), His Majesty's Ambassador in Moscow (Esmond Ovey), and officials of the Foreign Office, India Office, and the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department.Matters discussed in the correspondence include:The visit of the Hejazi delegation, headed by Emir Feisal [Fayṣal bin ‘Abd al-‘Azīz Āl Sa‘ūd], Foreign Minister for the Kingdom of the Hejaz and Nejd, to Moscow, and later, via Turkey, to Tiflis [Tbilisi] and Baku, in May-June 1932.Soviet trade interests in the Hejaz.Concerns expressed by Sir Andrew Ryan in July 1932 that the Soviet representative in Jedda could seek to consolidate Soviet relations with Ibn Saud [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] and encourage the latter to take a strong line regarding Transjordan.Unconfirmed reports of a Saudi-Soviet trade agreement in early 1933.Notes on the character and previous career in Jedda of the newly appointed (as of January 1936) Soviet minister at Jedda, Kerim Khakimov.News in May 1938 that the Government of the Soviet Union has decided to close its legations in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, reportedly as a gesture of disapproval of the Anglo-Italian Treaty [Anglo-Italian Agreement], but considered by the Foreign Office to be part of a general policy of reducing the number of its foreign contacts.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
