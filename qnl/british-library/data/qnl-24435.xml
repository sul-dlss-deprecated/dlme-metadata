My telegram of 20th October not to ^ommander-in-Chlef or Political ^gent. Matter concerns Irucial ^oast. ^fter Worth left I have heard rumoured attempt had been made recently on life of Shaikh of Dibai. Shaikh is now on a hunting cruise and returns in a few days. h e Informed me yesterday that there are increasing signs of trouble between him and his cousins coining to a head on his return and that an attempt might be made to depose him. Shaikh says that he can take necessary action himself but this will probably involve open hostilities in which case Bedouin will take a part, ^s there are many British and foreign traders they being rich would be first to be looted and probably injured. He thinks His Majesty’s Government should give him permission to protect himself or failing this that British should afford protection. Residency ~gent confirms statement _n third and fourth paragraphs also that Shaikh had been warned that his life is in danger. Isa also states that cousins have been stirred up that we would not employ as a lines loss of Independence owing to Shaikh’s friendship with us. His part in air negotiations, ^jman-Sharjah settlement. Presentation of O.B.E., Yas settlement etcetera are all used to create mistrust and ncomnibn loss of confidence in Shaikh by his subjects. Cousins object is to subvert h s position. That a disturbance of a serious nature will take place / soonsoon appears likely. C ous p ns have called for a majlis on his return which he cannot long delay without attempts on his life. It was significant that for first time cousins were not present during last visit to Oibai. As his friendship and valuable assistance in Crucial Coast negotiations have brought about present trouble we have a moral obligation to assist him now. I consider that the only way to prevent bloodshed is that we should inform Shaikh Mana bin Rashid of the circumstances in which the three brothers who are causing trouble, that their intrigues are known and that they will be personally held responsible for any trouble that may arise. If you consider that British should not interfere in matter Shaikh should be informed without delay but presence of His Majesty 1 s Ship is necessary when he takes action owing to number of ^ritish subjects in Ribai.Telegram: - XX.

Shaikh informed Senior Naval Officer who met him on October 21st that attempt would be made shortly by his cousins to depose him. Shaikh stated that he could deal with situation himself but this would probably involve open hostilities with Bedouins who would take part and British Indian traders might be looted and injured. Shaikh thinks His Majesty’s Government should give him freedom to protect himself or give him British protection. 2. Residency Agent with whom Senior Naval Officer has been in touch confirms general situation as seen by Shaikh. 3. Senior Naval Officer suggests we should assist Shaikh and warn cousins that we hold them responsible for any trouble that may arise. 4. This suggestion however would probably involve us ultimately in measures of interference in internal quarrels of Dibai which is there is objection to the considered policy of -- • ■ His Majesty’s Government on Trucial Coast. Shaikhs must stand on their own ^legs and our only real concern on land is to try to ensure the of lives and property of British subjects.Resident. 5. I am asking Senior Naval Officer _ so good as soon as possible a Sloop to stand by at lilbai with Residency Agent on board. Residency Agent will convery message to Shaikh from me that he as Ruler must take steps as he sees fit to protect himself and his administration from his cousins but should British lives and property be endangered the culprits will be called severely to account.

Shaikh of Dibai held family mejlis yesterday Thursday seven disloyal cousins not attending, desalt all of family except cousins are backing Shaikh who will hold mejlis shortly when Residency Agent is confident Shaikh will obtain unanimous support except for cousins who with followers only total about 40 persons. Shaikh was glad to hear of H•M.S•Lupin*s arrival: he had asked Residency Agent to-day to request Senior Naval Officer to send Sloop whose presence would immensely strengthen his position. Local inhabitants also impressed already by three aircraft who arrived fortunately at Sharjah to-night. In view of improved situation which will be better tomorrow when H.M.S. Lupin anchors at Jibai* suggest that it would be wiser to omit early part of Political Resident’s message to Shaikh in telegram No. 895 by deleting in paragraph 5 from words 'Ruler” to word 'but”. This can be added subsequently if opposition in mejlis is encountered. I cannot seethat any useful purpose will oe gained in we x$&lt;l 3 #^)cxemphasising to Shaikh that^_have no intention ox giving him assistance when his opponents seeing British aircraft and sloops assembling at .ibai have come to naturally opposite conclusions.

Lupin’s 2103 of 26th October, Shaikh of JDibai is making good use of presence of British Aircraft (which I presume is accidental) to impress upon his subjects that he has British backing. This has had a very satisfactory effect. In view of policy mentioned in paragraph 4 of your telegram No.895, I consider Shaikh should be given ^ complete message otherwise he himself will misconstrue presence of sloop and a British aircraft.

Be asked if he still had family support promised in previous family majlis, all sections of tribes promised loyalty. Shaikh then stated everyone must obey his rule which forbids robbery, violence etcetera. He added that cousins were provoking violence in Dibai and attempting to depose him, cousins claiming Shaikh was too friendly with British who now dominate Libai. He stated that his father had always followed British advice and in no case had interference occurred. Majlis concluded with unanimous support for Shaikh and now one relation with other notables are summoning cousins tomorrow forenoon to explain that they must obey his rule or he will take measures against them. Anticipate compromise. Residency Agent has delivered Political Residents telegrams 923 and 924 informing Shaikh that these preceed 918 as Residency Agent contemplates Shaikh will infer British backing is being withdrawn. Shaikh will be advised to jkeep 923 secret as British prestige soared when 918 was broadcast land likewise would crash if it was suspected that Shaikh no longer had support. My impression is that Trucial Coast is watching to see if British Government will standby their friends.If we fail to support Shaikh of Dibai now by hedging it will (Group mutilated ?

Subjectf -elicy en the Trucial SlT| ^ith reference to my teXegram Ko.962 of the 6th November, 1934, in which I promised further details as to the settlement between the Shaikh of Dibai and his cousins* with the assistance of a report supplied by Colonel Loch, who was in charge at Dibai when the settlement was made, I can give the following summary 2o with reference to paragraph 6 of my telegram 1***0 *896, dated the 24th October .934 the notices finally issued by me took the following form A* 1 am directed by the Honourable the t olitic &gt;1 Resident to infcrm you that you as Ruler must take such steps as you see fit to protect yourself and your administration from your cousins* You should, however ensure that the lives and property of British subjects residing in your territory are not in danger* B« The Honourable the Political Resident who has heard that there is unrest at Dibai warns all inha bitants that in the event of loss of life or property of British subjects in the Town resulting from any disturbance those responsible for causing such disturbance will be held to account.«* 2 * 3. Notice a contained a clear Intlo&amp;tlon to tl^e ihaikh that he wad at liberty to take what meaeuree he liked to deal with those who were endeavouring to depose him, while at the same time reminding him that proper precaution© should he taken with regard to British lives and property# The Shaikh was apparently fully &lt; live to his responsibilities in this respect and even before the receipt of the notice had placed guards over the houses of British subjects* Notice B emphasised the fact that in case these lives and property were endangered as a result of any disturbance those responsible for causing the disturbance would be held to accotint* The causers of the disturbance, though for various reasons X did not name them, were in fact the cousins* 4* With regard to the causes of the disturbance* For some years past Shaikh 3a 1 id bin l a*.turn has had trouble with his cousins, the sons of the late Shaikhs Rashid and Buti, which culminated in an attempt on his life on 23rd September last and a proposal by them, during the Shaikh 9 s temporary absence from the town, to summon a m jlis to depose him* On Shaikh 3a*id*s return, encouraged by the measures of support, mentioned in paragraph 6 below, accorded to him, he Issued an ultim turn to his cousins demanding that they should either come to his house and swear loyalty to him or quit the town. After lengthy negotiations carried on by members of the v (the Shaikh's sub-tribe) Al bu Falaah/a representative of each branch of the cousins presented themselves at the shaikh's house and swore the oath demanded. The result of the settlement is that the Shaikh 9 s position is now stronger than it has been for m?ny ye*rs* The .ihaikh informed Colonel Loch that he waswas quite satisfied with the settlement and considered his position now secure. He expressed to Colonel loch his gratitude for the support which h*,d been accorded him. I think the general result of the Dibai incident has bean* if aU goes welly to strengthen our position appreciably long the TTucial Coast* 5. Perhaps the most satisx’actory fe ture of the settlement between the haikh and his cousins is that it was siade by the haikh himself with a measure of support from us which was useful to him, for which he is duly grateful, but which in no way involved us in interference in the internal affairs of Dibai. These measures consisted in the sending of a sloop by the Senior Naval Officer at my request in the first instance with kh n Sahib Hussain bin Assan on board, (the residency Agent himself being unable to leave Sharjah on account of illness), and then with Colonel Loch in chargef a flight of aircraft over Jibai arranged by the &gt;.ir Officer Commanding, Bagdad, at my proposal} and the promise of a present of arms which 1 made to the Shaikh and which I ensured should be known throughout Town. In this connection it may be noted that the shaikh can on production of a M N© objection' certificate from me, import arms whether as a present or on payment. 6.

Khan Sahib Hussain bin Assam did good work and Colonel Loch on his arrival fondled tfo situation effectively.7* ihe Jibai incident has been closed satisfactorl* « It raises, however, in an interesting form the general question of our policy in that part of the Ferslan Gulf. The recent opening up of the Trucinl Coast as part of the civil and strategical .hir aoute, necessltatingthe establishment of an Air Port at Sharjah, md of landing grounds, flying boat anchorages and petrol stores for the Royal Air Force aircraft at other places, has inevitably brought us into close contact with that coast, with which until the last few years we were less directly concerned* This closer contact has perhaps tended somewhat to obscure what our basic responsibilities actually are* These may be classified as followss (a) the protection of the lives and property of British Indian subjects* It may not be out of place to note here that as far as the commercial interests of these subjects are concerned it must be remembered that we have no order-in-council, and therefore we have no legal redress there as in muscat, Bahrain and Kuweit for the claims, for instance, of these subjects ag inat the subjects of a Shaikh* All that cm be done in such eases is to try and induce the Shaikh concerned, through the Residency Agent, to force his debtors subjects to satisfy our plaintiff* such action if successful results as a rule in some kind of compromise between the parties* ^here it is not a case of civil claims but of danger to British lives and property in case of disturbance we can of course take a much stronger line and warn the Shaikh concerned of his special responsibilities in this connection (b) Under our Treaties with the Shaikhs we must prevent hostilities at sea, arms traffic, end the slave trade*trad©* nvy ~ 6 • ^f© are also responsible for protecting the Ghr ikhdoaia by sea* In the case of oharjah f unaer the terms of our ir Port Agreement with the Shaikh, we have to protect him from any form of aggression arising fro® the air port being situated in his territory* (c) A new responsibility - the safety of ths ir Houte both for civil r nd Royal Air force aircraft* 8* These are our actual responsibilities on which we should concentrate* m are not responsible for the enforcement of law void order nor for the stopping of hostilities on l^nd though, as in the past, we can endeavour through the Residency ^gent to compose differences bstween Shaikhs* «e should not however, mke ourselves responsible for the ©moreament of any agreements come to between shaikhs* ■«© are, under our Treaties, not responsible for the protection of the shaikhs on land, though doubtless in the case of serious encroachment, or attack by a powerful enemy we should he ve to assist them* &lt;*e ore not responsible for keeping Shaikhs on their thrones when they can longer keep themselves there* 9* It is obvious that a policy for the I racial Coast based on the above genmal considerations cannot be an ambitious one, but these considerations are put forward with strict regard to the h rd foots of loc 1 circumstances* However much at any particular juncture eny particular section of a fruci 1 ihaikhdo®, incluuing pe hops the Sheikh himself, for thdir own ends, might welcome our active interference in their domes tie affairs, there would certainly be an opposition party who would bitterly resent it* moreover, nd this ns aa most important factor, any such active interference would sooner or Inter involve us in supporting such interference by force. &lt;rtu,t are the forcible means at our disposal ?

The urgent necessity of obtaining tliese has iiievitably , * ted our policy on tlie Trucial Coast for the last live years, bver since the decision was made to transi or the ir iloute fl'om Uie Persian to this Arab side of the Gulf it is hardly an exaggeration to say that no .uUtica Officer, whether resident or otiiex % wise, has been able to visit coast without bei/^g under the trying obligation of endeavouring to extract - as painlessly as possible - air facilities from some more or less reluctant h ikh. This reluctance was chiefly based on tho fear that the obtaining of air facilities was merely the first Step toward 3 the establishment of British administration over the Sheikhdoms 9 the shaikh of ^harjah t for example, was careful to insert a clause in his . ir rort gresaoxit that the granting of that port in his territory in no way entitled us to interfere in his internal? internal affairs* This fear, l trust* the are now beginning to understand is unfounded ( though it is an addition 1 agreement for pursuing a policy of non interference in the internal affairs of the Trucial Coast ), Biiu wii© facilities in ciuestion have heen f-cc^uired 1 bm glad, to say without the exercise of force, though only *fter interminable bargainings and negotiations which have left little time for the settlement of other matters* Now that these facilities are actually in being the Sh*Vtim do not I think regret their acquiescence* They appreciate the favourable monetary terms they have received - especially in these hard times, aid in certain cases, as at dherjah, they benefit by &amp; public W/T station and - shortly I hope - by a * ost Office* The Shaikh of Dibai, for instance, has stated more than once that he bitterly regrets his refusal to have the /ir Port at his town# At the same time they - the Shaikhs - for some years past have had to be harassed and hustled, when they know very well - and personally 1 quite agree with them - that 'haste is from the devil* • Cnee the question of the Yas Island tank is setvied, concerning which Colonel Loch is paying a visit to Abu Dhabi shortly, the last of the air facilities will have been obtained on the Trucial Coast# It will then be possible for my tours, and those of the olitical officers under me, to that part of the Gulf to assume the more pleasant complexion of visits undertaken to establish friendly relations with the Arab Hulers, who should now be left in poace to settle down and adapt themselves to the new conditions which the coming of an important air route lias brought to the it territories. ll* To sum up * The Dibai incident ( paragra, hs 1-6) waswas satisfactorily settled lay a general policy of laying the responsibility on the Shaikh himself of dealing with internal trouble# He was given a free hand to deal with those who wished to depose him, and at the same time was informed that he should take precautions for the safeguarding of British lives and property# The malcontents were also reminded that they had a special responsibility in this respect# The Shaikh had a measure of support from us which was useful to him, and for which he is grateful, but which in no way involved us in the internal affairs of Dibai# Further incidents on the True la 1 Coast elsewhere might mutatis mutandis be dealt with on t e same lines# With regard to our future policy on the Trucial Coast which has been raised by the Dibai incident # fe have certain definite responsibilities on that Coast (paragraph 7) which we cannot avoid, and on which we should concentrate# We should avoid taking on new ones (paragraph 8), the most important of which would be the preventing of hostilities between Shaikhs on land, though whenever opportunity occurs we should give our good offices to the Hulsra for the composition of their differences. The main argument for avoiding active interference in the internal affairs of the Trucial Coast is hat sooner or la ter we would be compelled to support this interference by force, which would be most unadvisable (paragraph 9). For some years past our policy on the Trucial Coast has been dominated by the urgent necessity of obtaining air facilities from its shaikhs (paragraph 10), who thoughthough they now appreciate the advantages which they receive in return for granting such facilities - have had to be hustled by us in obt ining them. The facilities in question having bean received there will be more opportunities for cultivating personal and frisndly relations whicn the shaikhs, who should now as Tar as possible be left in pease to adapt the&amp;aelves to the new conditions which the establishment of the nir Route has so rapidly brought about in their territory# 1 would be grateful if the Government of Xndia t should they see fit| would give their general approval of the policy outlined r bove* which c^n thezi become a guide for the future, I am sending copies of tills despatch to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for lndia f the Senior Nav 1 Officer| Persian Gulf, the Air Officer Commanding, hriUsh rorces in ‘Iraq and the Politic ! ngent, Bahrain, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, SdA r*C*Fowle.

Political.Extract paragraph 5, News of the Trucial Coast No;20 from 15th to 31st October 1934, (Original in File 30/9). 5. Trouble at Dibai between Shaikh Sa 1 !# and His Cousins , and the arrival of H.M.S. Lupin . v W * mm 1. H.M.S. Lupin arrived on the 26th evening at Sharjah and stayed the night there. In the morning the Captain landed and met the Residency Agent and asked him to accompany him to Dibai. As the Residency Agent was sick he could not do so, but had sent, on his behalf, his Munshi Khan Sahib Husain bin Hasan. 2. On the 27th, the sloop arrived at Dibai and Shaikh Sa’id bin Maktum went on board and talked to the Captain what he had in his mind. The Captain replied that he will refer the matter to the authorities concerned. The Shaikh landed and 'held a meeting consisting of his tribe, the Albu Falasah, and entered into agreement with them that they will be on his side at time of peace and trouble. After this agreement and undertaking, he told them that his cousins always commit aggression, plunder, assault and interfere in the affairs of his Government which they have no right to do. That if they still continue to do this, he did not want them to stay with him in the town. When the Albu Falasah heard this they told him not to turn them out from the town but that they will prevent them from such activities and that they will bring them to Shaikh Sa , id and will be treated in the same manner as his subjects and that they will have no rights to interfere or meddle with things just as they used to do in the past. After he was pressed by them he agreed to this. 3. On 30th Colonel Loch arrived at Sharjah by the Wapatis H.M.S. Lupin went to Sharjah and brought Colonel Loch to Di bai. 4. On 31st, Shaikh Sa*id went on board and called on Colonel Loch. He also explained to him the trouble existing between him and his cousins and of the present affaris. The Shaikh then landed. Col.Loch then landed and returnedhe the call of o£ the Shaikh after which/returned to t sloop which remained opposite Dibai. 5. On 2nd November 1934, the Albu Falasah tribe informed the cousins of the Sahikh of the object of Shaikh Sa*id and advised them to stop their activities and go on the right path. They agreed to do so as they were afraid lest the Shaikh might turn them out from the twon* The Albu Falasah then immediately took Hashar bin Rashid, on behalf of his brother, to the Shaikh and arranged peace between them. On 3rd November the sons of Bati came and met Shaikh Sa*id and a peace was arranged between them in the manner demanded by the Shaikh from them. After sunset, Colonel Loch land, as Shaikh Sa*id was sick, and bade him goodbye. He then returned to the Sloop which then left. At present, no trouble is being created by the cousins of the Shaikh of Dibai,Conxidexitial. your telegram No»9'90, dated the 19th December 1934, regarding rifles for the Shaikh of Dibai. I agree that it would normally be good policy to n buy British* 1 . In the present instance, however as Mausers are the make hitherto imported by the Shaikh, I think it preferable - in view of possible enquiries by the Persian Government through our Legation - to get Mausers rather than a British make of rifle.

At the meeting with the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast on board H.M.S.''Hawkins' on 23rd January, 1935, the Shaikh of Debai for a private interview, which I granted. 2. The SnaiKh stated that he had supported the British Government for many years and when there had been trouble between different Shaikhs he had, from time to time,-heeiT asked by the Residency Agent to mediate. He had compelled his people (at the request of the Political Resident) to pay debts claimed to be owing to Indian merchants. 3. His cousins therefore spread abroad the statement tnat he had sold his country to the British. 4. The Shaikh said that he considered that in return for his past services the British Government should support him. 5. He asKed that next time there was trouble with his cousins a British Political officer might attend a meglis at Debai. Should he decide that the cousins were to blame, the Shaikh asked that approval should then be given for the offender(s) to be exiled. 6. The Shaikh added that he could easily call in Bedouins to help him. If he did so, however, looting might result and Persian and Indian merchants might suffer damage. In that event he considered th t the aggressors should be held res- ponsible and not him. 7 • I informed the Shaikh of Debai that I would report his remarks. sd. F•F•ROSE.

Memorandum . Sub.iect : Shaikh of Debai . With reference to your Memorandum No.E.I.3273 L* dated the 28th January 1935, particularly paragraphs 5 and 6. 2. The Shaikh’s request for a Political Agefct, in the case of trouble, to visit Debai and judge between him and his cousins is unnecessary from his point of view since, as he is the Ruler recognised by His Majesty's Government, his cousins in trying to rebel against his authority are de facto in the wrong. The reason why the Shaikh, in spite of this, makes his request is presumably with the object oi involving us in his internal affairs and shifting some of the responsibility at all events of dealing with his cousins from his shoulders to ours, which from our point of view would be most undesirable 3. The whole problem is rather a diiiicult one and involves conflicting interests* On the one hand when there is trouble at Debai, or elsewhere on the Arab Coast, my iirst responsiba- lity is for the lives and property ol British subjects, ana I have therefore to remind the Shaikh that he should take adequate measures to this end. On the other hand the Shaikh naturally wants to deal with the recalcitrants v r igoi ously and may find his hands ^tied by having to ensure thut Britishr lives and property are not endangered. But this is inevitable• The communications which I issued through the Residency Agent / 4.V agent when the trouble arose at Debai in November last, read as follows: A. (to the Shaikh). I am directed by the Honourable the Political Resident to inform you that you as Ruler must take such steps as you see fit to protect yourself and your administration from your cousins. You should, however, ensure that the lives and property of British subjects residing in your territory are not in danger. B. (general notice). The.’Honourable the Political Resident who has heard that there is unrest at Debai warns all inhabitants that in the event of loss of life or property of British subjects in the Town resulting*from any disturbance those responsible for causing such ;disturbance will be held to account. 5.

Sir, I am commanded by the Air Council to refer to India Office letter No.P.Z.7199/34 of the £8th November 1934 forwarding a copy of despatch No.C/3t&gt;6 dated 16th November 1934 from the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, embodying his views as to the future policy of His Majesty 1 s Government in the Persian Gulf. 2. The Council note, inter alia, that Colonel Fowle is of the opinion that ”we should avoid taking on. the preventing of hostilities between shaikhs on land':; and that our policy should continue to be one of 'avoiding active interference in the internal affairs of the Trucial Coast'. In viev/ of the increasingly active interest that the United States, Japan, Persia and Saudi Arabia are taking in trade and commerce along the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, the Council feel some anxiety lest the passive policy advocated by the Honourable the Political Resident should result in a further lowering of British prestige in the Gulf and thus threaten the security of the air route with which they arc deeply concerned, 3. The Air Council feel, therefore, that the time may have come when His Majesty’s Government's age long policy of nder Secretary of State, non-interference^ Political Department, India Office, S.W.lnon-intorferonce in the internal affairs of the Sheikhdoms should bo ro-oxaminod with a vie?/ to determining whether, in the light of the altered conditions of to-day, it should not be modified to a certain extent. They do not suggest that His Majesty's Government should assume the control of or even take an active part in the internal affairs of the Arab Rulers, but rather that the Rulers might be informed that as long as they conduct themselves in a satisfactory manner His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to support their authority. 4. The Council would therefore be grateful if Sir Samuel Hoaro could see his way to circulate the confidential despatch No.C/306 from the Honourable the Political Resident to all members of the Middle East Sub-Committee and thereafter to convene a meeting of the Committee at which the implications of the policy advocated by Colonel Rowle might be discussed.

Department) Sir. la To Secret-' ry of State for India, London; (Cony ty po31 to BusLire.) Your telegram No*095 of the 26th of March. We have discussed this question with Powle and our views are as follows:- 1. The foundation of our policy on the Trucial Coast is Lord CurzcrJs address delivered at ohargah on the 21st November 1903. The Principles then laid down in our opinion still hold, with the addition that we have now to ensure the safety of the air route. This policy is again defined in paragraph 1 oi Powle*s letter No.C/306 dated the 16th November 1934. It expressly excludes interference in one internal affairs of the Sheikhdoms, -and differs in this important respect from the conception of para mo untcy as understood in India* 2* The concern of the Air Ministry is limited to the additional responsibility for uhe safety of the air route. If this can be securoo by a minimum of commitments as at present, namely by specific agreements with oheikhs icj. air facilities ard our general position on Trucial Coast as based on Treaties and long connections ] &gt; r 1$2* 1031 connections * there is in our opinion no advantage in assuming new ones. In particular we are opposed to suggestion that an announcement, such as oroposed by Air Ministry at the end of para. 3 of their letter, should be made to Rulers as this would imply a measure of general support in the internal administration, the responsibility for which we should not undertake. If they break their specific agreements for provision of a:lr facilities, they are well aware that suitable action will be waken to deal with them. If at any time the necessity for insuring the safety of air route necessitates assumption of fresh responsibilities, the posi tion will have to be faced, but that is not at present 3* One other matter in our opinion re quires consideration at the present juncture. The development of Saudi lower in Arabia has already led to negotiations with Ion Baud for s, definition of boundaries between his kingdom and the limits of the Coastal Rulers&lt;. If Ibn baud were to attack Trueia1 theiks or inoeed Muscat, His Majesty 4 s. Government , whether or n#t in conjunction with the Government of viidia, would presumably have tc defend them irom aggression on land., thus adding, to undertakings issued by Lord Curzon* In certain circumstances it is already intended to enter into a respon sibility of this kind with Qatar, and (V_idfL^ .3 1031 i India Office letter to Political Resident NO.FZ12S9/34, dated tne Sth March 1934) it Is agreed that a responsibility for of Kuwait has been assumed. Thi the defence s honever is an entirely different proposition from the Inauguration of a policy of interference in Internal affairs, resort to which, in our ooinion, tire present juncture entirely unnecessary. 4c The statement in the paragraph above should be read subject to the Qualification that India has to (3 if end not accepted any military commitment tne Arab Rulers against aggression by landTelegram From Political Bahrain To Britconsul,Bushire.

Subject? Trucial Coast Policy. Sir, v V I have the honour to refer to India Office letter No.P.Z.2853/35 of the 5th June 1935 on the above subject. 2. ¥y views as faras the Air Route on the Trucial Coast is concerned, (as given in my letter N 0 .C/SO 6 of 16th November 1934 to the Government of India), which were generally supported by the Government of India in their telegram No.10^1 of 22nd April 1935 to the Secretary of State for India, are briefly as follows. That so long as we can secure the safety and working of the Air Route by our present minimum of commitments, there is no object in our assuming new ones, such as interference in the internal affairs of the Trucial Sheikhdoms. 3. The recent incident at Abu Dhabi - vide correspondence ending with my telegram No.569 of 26th June 1935 - would seem to support my views. By enforcing tribal responsi bility, and by insisting under a threat of punitive action that the Shaikh should honour his Agreement with regard to the building of the petrol store, we have - without any interference in the internal affairs of the Shaikhdom - gained our end. I instructed the Political Agent, Bahrain, to2 ■* to explain, in a subsequent tour which he made along the Truoial Coast, to the other ghaikhs what had happened at Abu Dhabi, and particular^, the action which wouldWe been taken lor His Majesty’s Government had Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan shown further obstructiveness. I have no doubt that this explanation will have had a salutary effect on these Rulers. Should, however, any Shaikh in the future refuse to act up to his Agreements a general line of action similar mutis mutandis to that taken at Abu Dhabi can be employed 1 am sending aecopy of t his letter to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India and to the Air Officer Command- ing, British Forces in ’Iraq* Bagdad.

LOCAL EVENT'S. 1 . Dubai• ¥ith effect from the 19th January, Shaikh Said bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai, authorised his cousin Shaikh Sai’d bin Butti bin Suhail fto rule) over a part of Dubai called Dairah. Shaikh Sai’d bin Butti took the following action:- Firstly he turned the gamblers out of the town and had the town made clean. He forbade loitering in the town at night from 4 O’clock Arabic onward. Whoever is found loitering after 4 O’clock Arabic would be beaten and detaied till next morning no matter he be a big or an ordinary man. Foreign notables, however, would be warned three times after which the order will be effected on them. By taking this action, he (Shaikh Sai’d bin Butti) intends, as far as possible, to protect the market from the robbers. The merchants at present are agreable to this action. A foreigner was caught and in his possession were found the articles which were stolen and reported by me, vide item No.266 of my diary No.23 of 1935 and item No.278 of my diary No.24 of 1935 and item No.244 of my diary No.21 of 1935. Formerly nobody knew who stole these articles. Also gold was found but its owner is not known. Inquiries were made from the said individual if he had any accomplice but he did not say of anyone. Shaikh Sai’d bin Butti made another effort and discovered two of his companions who confessed that they were six persons. Now all of them are in the jail of Shaikh Sai d bin Maktum. Investigations are in progress with a view to discover the rest. 2. Some of the cousins of Shaikh Sai'd hin Maktum were not in favour of his authorising his cousin Cto rule; over Dairah ahd the steps taken by the latter to clear the town, but Shaikh Sai'd bin Maktum talked severely to them and warned them. He instructed Sai’d bin ^dtti to take whatever measures which he thinsjk,are in the interest of the town and which would! ; / / &lt;P\JT | # n4F\J protect the lives of foreigners from murder and their properties from loss. 5. Shariah: On 19th, while Shaikh Sultan hin Saqr v/as going round the town at night in order to detect the evil acts, he came across some people gambling* He took them out of the house and set the house on fire because once before this his brother Muhammad bin Saqr had warned them to refrain from doing this act but they did not obey him. Shaikh Sultan also ordered that nobody is allowed to loiter in the town at night*Confidential.

Said bin Butti seems to be a thruster. His activities in cleaning up the night life of Dibai, though this does not concern us, is doubtless admirable, while his activities in arresting thieves and enforcing law and order are all to the good. 3. There is one point, however, which we shall have to watch and that is the warning given to the 'foreign residents of the higher class' i.e. 1 presume British Indian subjects, that if they are subsequently found acting contrary to a certain order issued by Said bin Butti they will be punished. As you know we have no Order in Council on the Trucial Coast and therefore I suppose technically speaking British Iddian subjects come under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh. In practice, however, we have always considered that these individuals do not come under the jurisdiction of the local Ruler, and if any action is taken against a British Indian subject by Said bin Butti we shall have an awkward situation 2 On the whole the appointment seems a good one and on Lieut.-Colonel Gordon Loch,CIE., Political Agent, Bahrain- 2 - / 3 ^ on our hfinds* x wixl discuss this question with you on my approaching visit to Bahrain. “'p'. cExtract from Sharis/* He port Wo. 3 of ^936 for the period from 1st to the 15th February 1936.

Then he was passed round the town for three days so that the other mischief-makers may refrain from doing such acts. The stolen articles mentioned in paragraph No.15 of my Diary No.2 of 1936 were found in his possession and taken away from him. As regards his identity, he appeared to be a native of Qatif.

Mistafah bin * Abdul Batif ! s agent in Bahrain brouglit them to m to enquire whether there was any objection to their being posted. 3. The letters contravene Article I of the Exclusive Agreement dated the 6th March 1892 (Treaties, Engagements and Sanads. 5th Edition, Volume XI, pp 256-257). 4. These letters raise a difficult question. On the one hand, it seems unlikely that we snail be able to get the Iranian Government to give any assistance in trie matver* but on the other hand it may become difficult to insist on the observance by the Shaikh of the terms of his Treaty il we acnieve nothing on his behalf * 5. Unless you wish to take up to contravention of the Treaty seriously, X would suggest that a possible course might be to send a message to Shaikh Sa«id through the officiating Residency Agent, Sharjah, saying that you do not propose to /permitpermit tiie letters (which coxitravene the terms of his Treaty) to be posted* If Shaikh Sa f id says no more, the matter might be allowed to drop, but if he asks what he is to do, the officiating Residency Agent might say that, if he wishes to pursue the mitter, he should do so through the Political Agent, Bahrain.

Over two months ago Farhud al Hajiri plundered 2 camels belonging to Shaikh Said bin Maktum and ran aw%y to the aesert. Shaikh Said sent 6 men after him who overtook him and brought him to Dubai and handed him over to Shaikh Saia. Farhud ^as kept in prison. Shaikh Said wrote to Ibn Jiluwi,Amir of Hasa about the action of Farhud ana receivea a reply to the effect that Farhud should be sent to Hasa as he is a Saudi subject. Farhud was in prison in Dubai for 2 months until the reply from Ibn Jiluwi was receivea. Shaikh Saia ordered me to take Farhud on my boat to Oqair ana hand him over to the Amir of Oqair. He gave me two letters, one for the Amir of Hasa and the other for the Amir of Oqair the contents of which i do not know. We arrived in Bahrain to-day ana want to transfer Farhud to a launch and take him to O^air as oraered by Shaikh Said.

I went to Dubai by land route 2i months ago together with 10 other persons of Oman ana one Dositi. Shaikh Saia bin Maktum gave presents to my companions but die not give me anything. Then I and my Dosiri companion whose name is Abdur Rahman bin Abdullah who is a Saudi Subject left for the desert oS^on our way plundered two camels belonging to Shaikh Said which we sold to certain bedouins in the desert for one she-camel. Later we went to Buraimi. One T Ali bin ^tiq. with 5 men sent by Shaikh Said to pursue me and overtake me, came and request^me to make a compromise withhat both sides should leave behind what happened in the past and open a new era. I agreed to this and we became on good terms with each other. Then we marched in the aesert and Jjalted at an encampment of Bani Kitab bedouins at Yidaya T water wells. While I was trying to make my she-camel kneel down, these persons rushed at me, threw me on the ground and handcutled me. Then they went to my Dosiri companion and shot him dead, ^hey took me to Dubai ana handed me over to Shaikh Said who kept me in prison and chained my legs. I remained in prison for 2 months and then he put me on a sailing boat which arrived in ^hrain to-aay with tne intention of taking me to Rasa.

From Captain T* Hickinbotham, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain, To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I n.o.\e the honour to enclose copies of correspond ence between Shaikh Said bin M&amp;ktum, Ruler of Du bai, and Abdur Rahman bin Ibrahim, Amir of *Oqair and Shaikh Saud bin Abdullah bin Jiluwi A1 Faisal, Amir of Hasa and to state that on «*j.ly the 27th I received a report from the Passport Officer of the Bahrain Government to the effect that a dhow had arrived from Dubai with a male prisoner on board. The Passport Officer enquired who the man was and the nakhuda, whose statement forms an enclosure to this letter, stated that he was a prisoner being sent by the Shaikh of Dubai to -the Amir of Hssa. The nakhuda produced a piece of paper sealed by Shaikh Said bin Maktua stating that the man was being sent to Hasa by order of Shaikh Saud bin Abdullah bin Jiluwi, This matter was immediately re ported to me* 2* I examined the papers and had the nakhuda interview ed by one of the Agency interpreters and Ms statement re corded. This statement forms an enclosure to this letter. The Agency interpreter obtained two letters from the nakhuda one of which was addressed to Shaikh Saud bin Abdullah bin Jiluwi and the other to Abdur ^hman bin Ibr&amp;hia, Amir of •Oqair, I had these letters opened with care and took copies of the contents. After copies had been made the * # letters/-letters were resealed and returned to the n&amp;khuda and he was allowed to depart with his prisoner, ^ ym h - ei&gt;lisa i the Intercepted letters, which form enclosures to this letter, you will see that the individual concerned had committed a robbery at Dubai and had been apprehended and that the Shaikh of Dubai was St.-nd^ii^, the man bach to Sa f udi Arabia, presumably for punishment, at the request of Abdullah bin Jiluwi. While I was in Dubai some time ago I heard that this individual was in jail for the theft and there was considerable rejoicing among the Shaikh*s family on account of his having been apprehended, I have no knowledge of the contents of the letter which it appears Abdullah bin Jiluwi addressed to the Shaikh of Dubai and I think it would be interesting to discover if an order was actually issued or merely a request, 4, Tills correspondence between the Shaikh of Dubai and the Sa*udi Arabian Governor is in my opinion a breach of Article D3o, i of the Treaty of 1S92 between His Majes ty* s Government and the Chief of Dubai. I was uncertain whether to detain the prisoner here and telegraph to you regarding this matter or whether to content myself with taking copies of the letters and allowing the prisoner to go and reporting the matter by mail. I thought that it would probably cause undesirable notice if the man was detained in Bahrain and so I decided that it would be better to permit the prisoner to be taken to Sa*udi Arabia as he was a S&amp;’udi subject and to report the matter to you by mail. 5. I am doubtful to what extent the Trucial Shaikhs make &amp; practice of returning offenders to the Sa*udi Arabian Government for punishment and in return receive their/--3- their own subjects from Sa’udi Arabian officials. There is no doubt that theoretically the Shaikhs should conduct all tueir correspondence with Foreign Governiaent officials through the Political authorities but practically it may be considered to be an advantage for a mutual exchange of offenders to take place thus saving us considerable cor respondence and responsibility, I should like to examine this question before making a definite recommendation* 6. I am making enquiries through the Residency Agent, Sharjah, regarding the customary practice on this point with particular reference to the Sheikhdoms of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, I have the honour to be.

Since 193C King Bin ^ Sa'^od extended his irtlnence tc £fea£rah(Aiu Bhati) arc to Bur a ini where the Darau* and sore of the •Asacir tribes becare his subjects. As the Trucial ShaiMis were vreaii and could not prevent outside raids, they were corralled by circur stances to couple in to the ia'udi Arabian authorities against their subjects and in all cases the punishnent uas satisfactory and much rore than vihet they vrculd rave inflicted aglinst the offenders* In order that they ray not offend the Sa’udi authorities f^l .

Residency A^entjS' 1 arjah*No. T/102-22/4 Oifice of the Political Agent, Bahrain on recess at Karachi. Dated 27th August 1937. From Captain T, Hickinbotham I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain at Karachi. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir I have the honour to refer to my letter No.C/591- 22/4 dated the 23th July 1937 paragraphs 5 and 6 and to enclose a copy of a report dated August 23rd No.C^750-16/4 dated the 22nd August 1937 from the Residency Agent, Sharjah. the Trucial Shaikhs are debarred from entering M into any agreement or correspondence with any power other then the Briti h Government”. It now transpires that all the Trucial Shaikhs have an agreement, probably unwritten regard ing the apprehension and punishment of offenders from Saudi Arabia and that they have all at one time or another corresponded officially with the Saudi Arabian authorities. Therefore the Trucial Shaikhs have consistently failed to observe the restrictions imposed by their Treaties of 1892. 3 . A reference to Bertram Thomas’ map of the Rub A1 Khali will show that the Awamir are well within the proposed limits of Trucial Oman and Oman, as cont©ripdated by the Riyadh line, and that the Daru (Darau) are located in the neighbourhood of Ibri which for practical purposes may be described as 100 miles north east of point J of the Riyadh line. It therefore appears that King Ion 2 . By clause I of the Protectorate Treaties of 1892 /Saud2 oaud is extending his influence to the eastward y even as far as Baraimi. We are confronted by two problems. • That of Ibn Saud 1 s extension of his influence eastward and that of the failure of the Trucial Shaikhs to comply strictly with the provisions of the Treaties of 1892. The first of these two problems I consider cto be of the greater importance. The fact of peaceful penetration into what has always been considered as Oman territory, I use the word Oman in a geographical rather than a Political sense, is sufficiently disturbing in itself, but when the potential oil developments in the area in question are considered '— it becomes particularly significant and alarming. Bven during the short period of time t at I have been in contact with the oil interests in the Persian Gulf I could not fail to notice that the centre of interest, as far as future development is concerned, is just this very area of country. The drillers of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company have, in my presence, spoken of their conviction that they are at present working in the wrong geological structure and that the south east the conditions should be ideal. The representatives of Petroleum Concessions Limited on the Trucial Coast have made no secret of the fact that they look on the Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi and to the south and east as the most likely country. Their geologists have already made a preliminary survey and having done so are anxious to push on beyond Baraimi this year into the area in question. One of the recent Muscat Concessions has been granted for the 'Sultan's Arabian Territories'. A very wide term which w&gt;uld include any territory which it may /be3 be decided belongs to the Sultan in this area. These facts in themselves may not be of great significance but collectively they have led me to the conclusion that those best qualified to know, believe that the Abu Qhabi- Baraimi-Ibri areas, and the area to the south west are the most likely to produce oil, I have little doubt that the Saudi Arabian aithorities have come to the same conclusion and if they have not will soon be encouraged to do so, by the California Arabian Standard Cil Company. This company has not been successful with their drilling up to date. T&amp;ey have entered into heavy financial commitments and so far have had no return worth mentioning. Naturally they are desirous of working in the most likely country. The Trucial Coast is closed to them and any prospect of obtaining a concession embracing this area through the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi has practically ceased to exist. The grant of the Muscat Concessions to Petroleum Concessions Limited has closed that door to the area. However, although it may not be possible for them to operate in the territories of these Chiefs it is possible for them to operate in Saudi Arabian territory. Therefore if they are to operate in this area it is necessary for Saudi- Arabia to establish a claim. This tne Saudi Arabian Government is in the process of doing. The question of the boundary between Oman, Trucial and otherwise, and Saudi Arabia has been pending for years. The Saudi Arabian authorities have not shown any desire to have the question settled expeditiously, in fact they have procrastinated and delayed in every possible way. In the meantime Ibn Saud* s influence As in my opinion by design and not by accident. The longer we delay a sect lament of the boundary question the worse will be our position. Ibn Saud will pushpush his territorial claims north and east, well beyond the limits of thepresent Riyadh line, and in reply to our protests will point out that not only does he claim the area but that the inhabitants themselves acknowledge him as their overlord. Any investigation that we like to make will only prove the truth of his statement. The longer we delay the stronger will his influence be on the borders of Oman. 6* It is high time that we took a strong line with Ibn Saud and there is no time like the present. His supremacy in Saudi Arabia is said to depend to a certain extent on his ability to produce funds when required. His financial position I understand is none to strong and he looks to the British Government to assist him. We have been for ever worrying about the effect of our actions on other E*uslim peoples and countries. In fact we have become so nervous of causing comment that we have done nothing and the only result that has been achieved is a loss of prestige in the aforesaid countries. A strong and determined policy with regard to Ibn Baud and the boundary question will have repercussions and very desirable r epercussions too. Cur influence and prestige will rise net only on this side of Arabia but all over Arabia. Publicity will be given to our actions and our intentions will be misconstrued by those to whose advantage it is to misconstrue them, but as anti-British propaganda is being disseminated daily oy the less reputable of the vernacular newspapers and wireless broadcasting stations I do not see thas our interests -er will be in jured to any great^/extent should we decide to take a firm line in Arabia than they are being at present.present. I advocate a policy of finnnesa in diplomatic relations with Xto Saud regarding problems affecting the Trucial Shaikhs and in particular the settlement of the boundary question on the basis of the Riyadh line. r h 1S qUesWon has ^en pending for years, as I have already said, and every endeavour should be made to arrive at a settlement this winter. 1 heard a rumour a short time ago to the effect that His Britannic Majestys Minister at Jedda was proposing that the suggested Qatar Boundary Commission should not be assembled this year and that the whole question should be postponed. 1 am opposed to any such suggestion and consider that not only should the Boundary eommission meet but that in aaaioion as much of the frontier between Oman and Saudi Arabia, as possible should he determined, if an early start is made/a firm policy adopted it should be possibL to settle the whole of this vexed question by the end of the spring. 8 * At t2le saine time as we are bringing diplomatic pressure to bear on Ibn 3aud with regard to the boundaiy we must not neglect affairs on the Trucial Coast. We must take measures to increase our knowledge of and influence in the country. I have already written at length on this subject in my letter Eo. C/539-25/4 dated the 10th July 1937 and will not trouble you by going over the ground again. It is essential that this cold weather we make a determined effort to open up the country and I suggest that as a preliminary we cannot do better than to follow in the footsteps of Sir Percy Cox. I would propose that a Political Officer accompanied by the Air Liaison Officer Bahrain and the Residency A gentAgent, should visit Bai*aimi and ft'om tliere Tjroceed to Ibri and possibly from there 5 with the cooperation of the Political Agent, Muscat, continue into Muscat territory* They would get in touch with the people and the leaders of the people. I will not attempt to define in this letter the aims and obj ects that should control the movements and c onduct of the party but I suggest now that the leader of the party should be empowered to discuss potential political agreements with independent tribal leaders. It would be of great advantage if the party was accompanied by an officer skilled in mapping or surveying and I suggest that the party should be prepared to leave Abu Dhabi by the middle of November. However if my views are favourably considered there will be time enough for the Political Officer who leads the party to go into details of time and space. I am only c oneerned in this letter with the general principle. 9 # . The second problem is really part of the first and is the direct result of our neglect of conditions in tnis part of Arabia. I am not concerned with the reasons for this neglect but with the results and the neutralising of the ill effects. We have two courses open to us and they are:~ I do not consider the first course advisable as it will involve us in an infinity of trouble. Should the Trucial Shaikhs in answer to our protests desist (a) to call the Shaikhs to account for their v / J • TM.-s-rwr, » countenanced or fb) to take no direct action but by increasing K / , x * a -i Vh ft -remove our min the cause from7 £i*oin sending Saudi Arabian offenders t»o Saudi Arabia for punishment, raids are almost certain to take place in addition to protests from Ibn Baud. The protests will no doubt be susceptible to diplomatic treatment but the raids will not. The Shaikhs will quite rightly point out that they are being raided because they have, by their acceding to our wishes, annoyed Ibn Saud and we shall thereupon be called upon to decide how far we are committed to take action todefend those in treaty relation with us who suffer f rom outside interference as a direct esult of their strict observation, at our request, of their treaty obligations. I have no doubt that we shall lodge a diplomatic protest but more obvious action will be necessary in addition if we are to maintain our prestige with the tribes. I agree with the Residency Agent and have no wish to advocate action likely to precipitate a crisis. Rather I advise, as he has done, the second course of action. Increase of influence by personal contact and the strengthening and supporting of the border states untSl they are able to stand alone against Saudi Arabia. An increase of our influence here will mean an increase of our influence in Saudi Arabia and a d ecrease of the Saudi Arabian influence in Oman and the Trucial Coast. A very desirable objective. X0 # Lest it be construed that I advocate a general policy of restraint and conciliation in our dealings with the Trucial Shaikhs I wish to make it quite clear that nothing is further from my intention. Too much restraint is misinterpreted by the Shaikhs as fear. Our Policy on the Trucial Coast must be one of firmness,fairness and kindness. The order is intentional. Firmness is the most important and most understood and appreciated by the leaders and people. Fairness is understood and appreciated but ^ cannot8 cannot stand alone as firmness can* Kindness is the medium by which friendships are formed between the peoples and the rulers and the political authorities* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant,Conf ideirc iaj &lt; (h) D # 0.Ho&gt;Q/277 , Oii'ice or tne Political Resident in tne Persian dull.

Captain Hickinbotham, His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrein, Persian Gulf. Dear Sir: Replying to your inquiry by telephone on October 16 regarding the intentions of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company in the Salwa area, I should like to quote the following from Mr. Ohliger’s reply to my letter of inquiry to him, which outlines very briefly the pro posed operations in the Salwa area: 'The Company is continuing the geological work connected with this concession and are at present working in the South Central portion of Saudi Arabia. It would be er roneous to say that the party will operate in this area for the next 18 months, since this work is always suspended during the summer months. It is unlikely that the present job will not be finished before next season’s work.' Hoping that the information contained herein is what you require, I am Ydurs respectfully, 1 cc Mr. F. W. Ohliger rV-MV Forker (Further action taken on file l/a/38 - Qatar - Saudi Arabia boundary question;.Secret. 1C A- D,0* No# C/197. Dated the 22nd March 1938. Aa you are now going to London, and will no doubt be discussing with the India Office many of the more imp ortant problems of the Gulf, I venture to suggest that the whole question of our arrangements on the Trucial Coast and our dealings with the Shaikhs should come under revision. 2. i. should have liked more time to spend on the Coast myself assimilating more of the atmosphere down there be fore making this report, but I think you should have this before you actually leave for London since the matter is becoming increasingly urgent. 3. Since I came to Bahrain the following main incidents have occurred on the Trucial Coast. (i) The refusal of the Shaikh of 'ias al Khaimah to call on one of the sloops or afterwards to apologise for his fail ure in courtesy. (ii) The refusal or failure of the Shaikh of Sharjah to arrange for the visit by the Oil Company’s geologists, ac companied by a Political Officer, to Jabal Faiyeh. (ill) The refusal of the Shaikh of Sharjah to write the proper letter accepting the Sharjah Political Agreement. (iv) The refusal of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to a range for a party to visit Baraiml. (v) The demand by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi for the same oil/- Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.S., C.B.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain .oil concession as was arranged with Ibn Saud of Arabia, (v&amp;) iUi attempt, fortunately detected, to import revolvers and rifle annum it i on into Oubai, as the result of which we are now demanding the deportation of the man %araami, (vii) The failure in the preliminary stages of the attempt to arrange a visit to Jabal Bafit. (viii) The recent agitation at 3uba.i in regard to the de portation of armstiers and the manumission of slaves, follov/ed by the throat to prevent the renewal of the Civil Air Agreement, 4, Quite apart from all the above which is common know ledge, I have the following information from various sources which I cannot disclose, (a) Extensive Slave trading continues in and through Abu Dhabi, The Shaikh is supposed to receive s, 40/- for each slave bought or sold in Abu Dhabi; while apart from such tran sactions in the Sheikhdom itself, one informant states that some 400 slaves passed through Abu Dhabi territory en route to Hasa or Nejd in a period of about five months recently, (Mote, This figure, I think, is an exaggeration but the ge neral story is probably true,) (b) A suggestion is being discussed in Dubai that the A1 ?alasah, i.e, the Shaikhly family, should subscribe the sum received by the dhaikh of Dubai on signing the oil concession, compel him to refund it to the Company and cancel the conces sion, (c) A 'growing resentment' is being engineered along the Coast against the alleged interference of His Majesty 1 s Govern- ment in internal affairs. (d) A verse from the Qoran,to the effect that 'The Homans are/--3- are defeated in the end of the earth, yet after their defeat they will conquer in a few years” is being commonly quoted. The Qoran year being equivalent to a thousand years, this ver se is being used to make people believe that the time has come for the fall of the British Umpire and the revival of the Roman Empire* (e) The story is being put about that the late Residency 3gent was deliberately poisoned by us and that ve are ready to poison any Shaikh who displeases us* (f) One report states that new revolvers, rifles and ammu nition are common in the interior* (g) Intensive Persian propaganda is in progress, and in fact I now have the names of some of the Persians living on the Coast who are supposed to be implicated* The object of this propaganda is to impress the Shaikhs and the people with the fact that the ii^glish are now impotent and that the Per sians have some mysterious source of power v/hich will enable them to free the Coast from British interference* (h) Finally there is the queer Dibba story, to which I need not refer in greater detail here* 5* If it were not for Oil end the Air Route down the Coast we could take all these fairly coolly, but as things are we certainly cannot* I do not think it will be denied that air communications with India are vital both in peace and 'sar, and that it is essential to ensure that the weak link on the Tru- cial Coast does not snap. I believe also, though 1 acknowledge it is only a personal opinion, that the existing and potential oil resources of the Persian Gulf will be vital to the itapire in the event of war* It follows that we cannot permit the Tru- cial Coast to become a secret base for hostile operations, end equally/-equally that such undeveloped oil resources as there may ba along the Trueial c&amp;ast and in the hinterland should be con trolled by British interests* 1 uch as one may allow for na tural antipathy on and behind the Coast towards the increasing inrpact of British interests! 1 feel that there are too many coincidences* too fnueh animosity towards us and too much unna- | tural agitation of a truculent nature for us to continue to believe that there are no outside hostile forces working agcinst us or that we can c ontinue to 'muddle along' as we have done hitherto* Cur prestige is dangerously low and Shaikhs openly speak of His I ajesty’s Government's pronouncements as 'wind'* 6* I an far from believing that it is necessary or even desirable for us to interfere actively in the internal affairs of the Trueial Coast Sheikhdoms. Yet at the s am time it is of immediate importance to take definite steps to re-establish our somewhat insecure position on this Coast. I suggest that it is time to outline a clear-cut policy which will t.ake ac count of the main desiderata which I have mentioned in para graph 5. Cur prestige must be revived and for that purpose I believe that not only should we show by more frequent pat rolling of the Coast that we have power! but also we should have a reasonable amount of money to reward services render ed! to buy service and to pay for information* finally our local representation must be more effective. 7. This latter point I regard as of paramount importance. In dealing vvith affairs on the Coast | in conducting our nego tiations with the Shaikhs and Notables and in obtaining infor mation in regard to current affairs we are at present represent ed by a promoted Arab clerk. I am far from denying the many excellent qualities which this man possesses, but at the same time/-time it is obvious that he must suffer from the normal defi- cieneies of his origin and training. The temptations placed in his way are enormous and it would be unreasonable Optimism to expect him to resist them indefinitely. At the same time it is not sui’prising that he should be universally disliked on the Coast (this is not his fault but the direct result of his birth). And finally I believe that in a place like the Trucial Coast the prestige of the British wpire can only be suceesjfully maintained by an taropean British Official, On this point it is interesting to observe that His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain expressed identically the same opinion to his Adviser in conversation recently. I am prepared to ela borate this argument if necessary but for the present I think it is sufficient to confine myself to a statement of opinion which 1 know to b e shared by competent observers* 3. I am afraid the picture I have painted is none too bright and that the proposals vhich I have made in rough out line involve some little expenditure* But if it is accepted that the Air Aoute and the potential oil resources of the Coast are of real importance, then it is necessary to visua lise a clearer policy - and some expenditure on insurance* Yours sincerely, tCONFIDENTIAL.

Mr• Weightman's concrete suggestions would merely lead to further expenditure for which at present there would seem to be no justification at any rate so far as the Government of India are concerned and for reasons explained in previous correspondence, the Government of India could not agree to undertake any further financial commitments in thatarea at present. It is also observed that Mr.vveightman puts forward as one of his arguments for increased control, the growing resentment whic. is being engineered along the coast against the alleged interference by His Majesty’s Government in the internal affairs of the Trucial Shaikhdoms. It would appear to the Government of India that this resentment would be increased if a more definite forward policy is deliberately adopted expressed by Sir Trenehard Fowle. Yvhile they realize that commitments in that area at present. As the Secretary of and-2- and to that Gxtent it would appear desirable to continue as long as possible the existing policy of refraining from any but essential interference with the Shaikhs. The appointment of a British Political Agent or Assistant Political Agent to deal with the Shaikhs might well increase the anxiety which is at present felt with regard to His Majesty’s Government’s intentions.

I think that possibly/has not been realised how much the appointment of Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, has been used in the past year to facilitate increased contact between the Agency and the Trucial Coast. Galloway, though admittedly posted for a special purpose, was Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, last winter and as Assistant Political Agent spent most of his time on the Coast. He was followed by Bird, who being completely raw, could not be let loose in Sharjah, but his appointment enabled me pay a series of visits to the Coast myself, a process which Howes is now continuing. Subject to Sir Trenc&amp;ard Fowle’s approval I will ensure when I revdrt to Bahrain, that the same process continues; and indeed, as thinga appear to be developing, I imagine that either the Assistant Political Agent or I mvself will have to be on the Coast a great deal during the coining winter. 3. But this does not go far to meet the essential need as I see it. When we get down to facts xt is very doubtful, if I may say so, whether the ideal arrangement mentioned by Peel will really work. hooking at the list of nine Assistant J in =— *n - P.« -n . *.i f one Aubrev Metcalfe, KCIE., CS:l: r* Secreta- y to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, Simla.'

Who is the next young officer with a knowledge of Arabic j and is he going to stay long enough to be recognised by sight on the Trucial Coast ? 4 . Knowing the difficulties of postings, I feel it is scarcely fair to enquire if it would be ever possible to guarantee an Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, for three years* Yet this is the minimum period if he is to be of real value on the Trucial Coast; for, with an officer necessarily so junior, one can write off the first year as a period of study alone - language* characteristics, habits, contacts, and, above all, the art of patience. For the next two year® the right man would be immensely useful, always provided he could stand life on the Coast for months on end; but, to be brief, a specialist is required, and I cannot help feeling that the real solution is to be found in employing a contract officer of the type of de Gaury. 5. In saying this I have of course gone beyond the terms of your enquiry; but I wanted to make it clear that however frequently and however extensively the Assistant Political Agent’s camp moves along the Coast, v.e can derive little benefit so long as cadre requirements involve such rapid changes of the occupant. ♦ 6.

In regard to the latter the Government of India are the Paramount Power with definite legal obligations both towards their Rulers and towards their people* The Ohaikhdoms, however, on the other hand, are (juridically) foreign States with whom His Majesty’s Government have special treaty relations,, To take an example. In an extreme cass of misrule the Government of India has the legal power of intervening to a very considerable extent in the internal administration of an Indian State. Ho such legal power at all events temporarily lies / Jeightman ^squire,!.0.3*, Political .Agent Bahra in7 irA ) * ■ i J £ t i \ &amp;€**■ / (% — 2 - lies in the hands of His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India in regard to a True iai Coast Shaikhdom. (Incidentally, the juridical position of Kuwait and Bahrain vis a vis His Majesty’s Government is the same as that of the Trucial Coast Shaikh!oms. Muscat is of course an independent sovereign State.) The imposition therefore of a close administration over the Trucial Coast Shaikhdoms would juridically be accompanied by some difficulties* I do not say that these difficulties could not be overcome, but the real question at issue appears to be: Is such an administration worth while ? (b) To establish a close administration over the Trucial Coast i* e* to institute tribal subsidies (of which we do not pay a penny at present), build roads, raise levies, appoint local Political Officers, and work more and more through them and less and less through the Shaikhs, make ourselves responsible for law and order and the administration of justice, employ the Royal Air porce for punitive measures whenever we considered it necessary, in other words to -’take over* the Trucial Coast, all this - or some modification of it - would not I think be difiicuj.... T le Trucial Coast is are not formidable, li-ce the Pat ban of the North yest frontier Province for example, and it would be maxnly a matter of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of Inaia between them providing the necessary funds and shouldering the necessary new commitments* (c) The result of this close administration, if carried far enough (an important point), would undoubtedly be that the Shaikhs would (metaphorically) spring smartly to attention and salute when spoken to, instead of being extremely evasive, obstinate and obstructive as they so often are at present, and - nV3? iillglaH if, 'kthat we should get what we wanted ( or some of it) straightaway instead of after long and tedious negotiations. (d) Ther?e is, however, no virtue whatever in a close administration in itself over a desolate area such as the Trueial Coast which would merely cost money and involve us in fresh commitments. Such an administration over such an area is a necessary evil, which is only justifiable if we cannot get our objects by any other means, and if our objects in themselves are sufficiently important. (e) What are our objects on the Trucial Coast ? Up to some ten years ago they were as follows; The protection of the lives and property of British Indian subj eists. (Z) The observance by the Shaikhs of our Treaties v/ith them. (f) Speaking generally, for a period of more than a century these objects had been achieved and preserved by a policy of what may be called tt non~intervention'** (g) In about 1932, however, a new and extremely important interest was added; the Trucial Coast became a link in the Imperial Ai** Route to India and beyond. The Trucial Coast Shaikhs were openly suspicious and hostile of this development, and it was only by prolonged negotiations that my predecessor succeeded in overcoming this suspicion and hostility, and in establishing the first air port at Sharjah. Once the ice was thus broken it has not been too difficult for us to obtain the further facilities needed though these also have been the subject of lengthy negotiations. I daresay that if we had had a close administration round about 1930 both the initial and the subse quent negotiations would have been shortened, but the point isr ■ that without it we got what we wanted* (h) About three years ago the Air Ministry and the foreign Office were inclined to think that with the actual increase of our air, and the possible increase of our oil, interests in the True ial Coast, not indeed a close administra tion but some form of closer control might be necessary* The India Office, the Government of India and myself took the view that since we were obtaining our objects by our present policy of minimum commitments, it would be better to defer undertaking new ones until the latter proved t o be definitely unavoidable. The matter was discussed at length at an Interdepartmental ^ ftujs . Meeting at the India Office held in about October 1935, at which I was present* The final decision was to make no change in our policy, but to n wait and see* 1 * That this decision was correct is proved by the fact that our interests, new and old, continued to be preserved by our old policy. Aircraft, civil and Royal Air Force, continued to fly up and down the True ial Coast and to use the local facilities in perfect safety, and Petroleum Concessions limited geologists were able to carry out their explorations along the coast. (i) A further new ’♦interest” has now arisen as follows. Petroleum Concessions Limited as a result of their coastal exploration came to the opinion that this belt of the Crucial Coast was not oil-bearing, but that the hinterland might possibly be so. They therefore wished to explore this area. Owing to the lack of control of the coastal Shaikhs over territories in the hinterland to which they laid claim, and to their obstructive attitude, and to the equally obstructive attitude of the hinterland Shaikhs, it took us more than a year to /*«• 13 -* to get petroleum Goncessiona Limited parties into the hinter land district of Baraimi, and when they did get there they have i now had to return having accomplished little or nothing in the way of exploration owing to the obstructive attitude of the local Shaikhs. This is of course disappointing but my own opinion is that even so by petroleum Concessions Limited actually reaching Baraimi, moving about to the limited extent possible, and making contacts with the local Shaikhs, the ice has been broken, and the way prepared for another effort. (I am dealing with Petroleum Concessions Limited Baraimi explora tion s eparat ely)• (j) But even for the sake of argument assuming that the .Baraimi venture was a total failure, what are the broad considerations which we must keep in view ? Our present interests lie along the coastal belt where the Shaikhs with whom we have treaties exercise a reasonable control, and where we can - as has been proved - preserve our interests by our present policy of non-intervention. The last thing we w a nt to do, unless it proves absolutely unavoidable, is to assume any responsibilities whatever in the hinterland where the terri tories of the coastal Shaikhs are far from being defined and where the local Shaikhs appear to be more or less independent. Prom the Intelligence point of view reports on the Shaikhs tribes and physical features of that area, aucn a s Howes who accompanied petroleum concessions Limited party has produced of the Baraimi district, are welcome, and in an emergency in case of enemy agitation and intrigue in the interior would be most valuable, but there our interest in the hinterland begins and ends. With one exception - oil. But at present we do not know /]mow that there is a drop of oil in the whole of the hinterland. Three years ago before oil came into the picture we were in different to affairs in the hinterland, and three years hence - if in the meantime it is proved by exploration that there is no oil there - we shall be equally indifferent. To adopt there fore any form of close administration, or closer control, in the hinterland, merely to enable Petroleum Concessions Xdmited to Judge whether there is oil in the hinterland or not, seems to me distinctly not worth the candle. In order to get Petroleum Concessions Limited parties into the interior we should therefore in my opinion continue with our present policy, slow as it may prove, of negotiation, and trust to the power of Petroleum Concessions Limited money bags to uring round the Shaikhs in time. the Arab side of the Gulf from the strategical point of view is of first-rate importance owing to the uncertainty of its various opportunities of expressing this opinion to the India Office and the Government of India. If therefore as a result of petroleum Concessions Limited exploration oil is . ouna A n the hinterland an entirely new situation will in my view be declare that in such and such areas experimental drilling is so forth, and to effect these we will probably have to taket 25c,) ■•7 m care will have to be taken that we do not commit ourselves too deeply since the result of these experimental drillings may well be negative, in which case once more we shall have little concern with the interioro On the other hand if the results are positive and an oil field, or oil fields, on the Bahrain scale, spring up in the interior, though even then we should do our best to avoid all unnecessary commitments, we may have to adopt a policy of closer control* But this will then be unavoidable and will be undertaken for an object of Imperial strategical importance which makes it well worth while* ( l ) I have said above that a close administration v/ould get us what we wanted straightaway instead of after long negotiations. I very much doubt, however, if such an adminis tration would act as a magic formula, &amp; sort of 1 open sesame 1 , for all our difficulties. Ho matoer how close our aomini &gt;-3 vra ti on was, the territories in question would still belong to the Shaikhs, and we would still have to allow them scope for driving hard bargains with us, or any oil Company invcl &gt; eo.. (m) To sum up® There is only one test of a policy and that is its success or failure, fudged by this test oar policy on the Trucial Coast of non-intervention, however hand-to-mouth and peculiar it may appear judged by the standards of other and more regular administrations, emerges with flying colours. Bor more than a century it has by and large obtained for us our objects with the minimum of commit ments, financial and political, and in recent years when new British interests have been created it has still delivered the goods. We have now a fresh interest on the Trucial Coast; possible oil in the hinterland, ana la. thi^ oil turns from /i / from a possibility into an actuality we shall probably have to change our policy, 'Rut it is far from worth our while to change this policy until we know for certain that oil really exists in the area concerned. In the meantime in order to ascertain whether this is so or not, in other words in order to enable Petroleum Concessions limited to carry out their preliminary exploration, we shall have to persist with our present policy slow as this may be, 3, On my views as given above there is one criticism which you might fairly offer. Your paragraph 6 to which I refer was very brief, and it is quite possible that seme fom of closer control only and not the close administration which I have also dealt with was in your mind. This may very well be the case, but as the failure of Petroleum Concessions Limited exploration does definitely raise a new issue on the Trucial Coast, and as the question of a close administration in that area may be raised sooner or later, I thought this a good opportunity to try and cover the whole ground. Another consideration is this. As we have found to our cost in various parts of the world, particularly in the East, it is extremely easy to start a forward policy, but once having done so it is extremely difficult to change into reverse and start a backward one, and it is almost equally difficult to have a limited forward policy, nne thing inevitably leads to another, and a policy of closer control, initiated for a specific object over a limited area, gradually and insidiously leads only too often to a close administration over a much larger area, which w/as far from being the original intention.H.V/gightman Esquire, Agent, Bah rain• Confidential. 1 ^ The Residency, Bushire, the 6th January, 1939. 1) 0 0 .

I was expressing no more than a sigh of regret that we seem reluctant to use the means we possess to deter a crew of feeble but ill-conditioned ¥ Shaikhs from treating the wishes of His Majesty's Government ♦vide representative illustrated appendix 5 with cuite such persistent of Hinterland Shaikhs. 3 rT ^ disrespect.

Indeed I can think of nothing more unsuitable* But it seems to me equally unsuitable that the almost/- fonourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.G., C.b.h., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, On board H.M.3* Deptford*- 2 - $ almost inevitable and invariable reaction to any with expressed by His Majesty’s Government should be hostility liberally flavoured with contempt• 4, Impressive as your arguments are, I venture to think that a slightly different background can fairly be depicted. We have achieved certain important results along the Trucial Coast in the past century and there has been a vast deal of bargaining, discussion and negotiation. It is far from my intention to belittle the patience and skill with which these negotiations have been conducted, but let us be strictly fair and remember, as the Coast remembers, how often we have had to resort to ,f power politics’ 1 , how often a deal has been clinched or an argument ended by the appearance of a warship, or a threat, expressed or implied, of direct action. At ^—. intervals over the century the ships have fired their guns ^ and the echoes have sounded for years up and down the Trucial and Batineh Coasts. In Bahrain itself we even assumed control of the administration at one time (actually, if not by formal declaration)• 5. It seems to me there are two conclusions to be drawn from these facts. First, that the Shaikhs have little respect for eloquence or fair argument, but are quickly impressed by an exhibition of the power of the British Government, of which they need reminders from time to time, and secondly that it is not unduly difficult in these parts to relinquish even a system of close administrative control, as we have done in Bahrain. But I must repeat here, to obviate misunderstanding, that I do not advocate close administration. I have argued in my demi-official letter No. C/197 dated the 22nd March 1938 that all we need on the Coast is more frequent patrolling by the sloops (this of course includes dhow-searching, and denotes/- 'p'v-okdenotes in effect a demonstration of power), a reasonable sura of money to reward services rendered and to buy information, and more effective local representation, I still adhere to these views, though when we are dealing with the hinterland, the show of strength must obviously be in the air and not on the sea. This does not necessarily mean that I want to drop bombs on Shaikh X or Shaikh Y or machine-gun them from the air, but I should like x.hem to realise that if we thought it necessary nothing could be simpler for us to do. (We are, after all, still concerned in the main with Shaikhs of settled — as opposed to nomad tribes). L * / ( ^ 6. The considerations which led to the last paragraph of ray 7 demi-official letter No. C/794 dated the 23rd December were these:* (A) A party sent out to prospect in Barairai and beyond by a company known to have the support of His Majesty's Government, and accompanied by a Political Officer, was ignominously turned out by a bunch of impotent Na'ira and A1 Bu Sharais Shaikhs. (B) Negotiations to enable the same party to enter Beni Kitab country were rendered unavailing mainly as a result of intrigue on the part of Jawasimi Shaikhs on the Coast. The repetition of such incidents - and worse - can certain ly be obviated by the mildest of threatening gestures, for, as you have said, these people are not formidable like the Pathans. 7. It seems to me it is not good for our prestige to accept these people at their own estimation. Let them have their bar gains by all means and. let us help them to get a square deal from the Gil Companies and so on. But let us make it perfectly clear that when we say we want a thing we are going to get it at something approaching a reasonable price and without undue delay? and that obstructive tactics do not pay. e came into this Gulf for trade and we are still here for its commercial possibilities and for the protection of our Imperial communica tions. (We do not like gun-running or slavery, but these are minor/-minor' consi.* rations in these days)* v. e cent, a inly do net v/ant tc administer their disgusting territories and people, hut if they happen to he on the air route or there is oil underground they have got to behave. can ensure this cheaply, easily and humanely, and I see no good reason why we should hesitate to do so. This does not involve any interference with their internal administration, except in so far as commercial develop ment may render it necessary for us to assume jurisdiction over non-Moslem foreigners; yet we cannot, I submit, altogether dis regard the latter possibility in deciding on our present attitude; and it will be the less difficult for us to obtain our possible ultimate desiderata if that present attitude be unmistakably firm. I suggest we should remember also that if oil is located in the hinterland, we shall be deeply involved in the allocation of rights to royalties etc, and it is well that there should be no doubt in any one’s mind that we shall act as arbiters and that we are well able to enforce our award. 8. Is it really a grave exaggeration to say that at the moment we are very near Sir obert landsman’s position, with his stick in one hand and his bag of rupees on the other ? The stick may not lie quite so comfortably in the hand; and the bag of rupees may not always (indeed it seldom does) belong actually to us* But we have got sloops and aii’craft (both with target-practice to do in their normal training programme - and why not near Shar jah, for a change ?), and we have a lot to say in the distribution of the contents of P.C.L’s money-bags. I only plead that we should take the maximum possible advantage of both, alfid of our growing knowledge of Who’s bo and how little (usually) he rep - * resents. vours sincerely,CONFIDENTIAL.

British Policy on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf.confidant lal fh« e» idency t 0,50*207-3 * Bus Hire, the 17th March, 1939. A# I shall shortly b« retiring from my present post I think It would be useful if I put on record my views on some of the wider aspects of our policy mi the Arab side of the Persian Gulf. j /jrr 2 , In a recent letter (vide my letter ^ 0 .^ 73 -!, dated the 23rd May 193a) I expressed some doubt as to whether it was generally realised hov economical our administration on the Arab side was in comparison with the important interests involved. But this statement leads naturally to a considera tion as to why we are able to implement our responsibilities at such little cost, and 1 think the main factor is that on the whole ?e possess the good-will of the Arab Rulers and their peoples. One reason for their attitude is that as far as possible we let them alone to manage their own affairs in thsir own way, and being human they much prefer to mismanage these themselves rather than have them efficiently managed by us. when by tne discovery of oil in one of tne at at os, e.g. Bahrain, there are sufficient funds for progress, we do not proceed to harry and hustle the T :uler and his people towards *efficiency', but content ourselves with providing them with experts to draw up simple plans, whicn the local government cart put into force themselves, with advice, and generally speaking with friendly guidance. Tven when they do /not Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, W?3l. ,MV &gt;., Secretary to the Government of India, external Affairs department, lew Jelhi.~ S'' not follow advice, provided it is not on &amp; maj or issue we aalce no attempt to force it down their throat*?, briefly we try to carry out a policy based on the modern methods of * indirect* rather than the older ones of * direct* rule. 3 . a second reaeon for the good-will in question ie that in our negotiations with the halers, over oil, air facilities and what not, fe give them a square deal. *e carry a money bat instead of a thick stick and are prepared to tal&lt; instead of t o threaten. This method costs some money, and takes time, but in the end we get what we want, and with no soreness left behind. This does not imply that our policy is a weak one. In any really serious differences of opinion between the states and ourselves, for example with regard to breaches of their Treaties with us, we are of course prepared to take a firm line, and a® you are aware on various occasions I have suggested taking drastic action. The threat, however, of this drastic action has hitherto been sufficient to achieve our purpose, and for the last ten years or so we have been able to obtain our objects on the \r&amp;b side, and to enforce the implementing of oar Treaties, without firing a gun or dropping a bomb. 4 . The third and most important reason for the good-will of the Arab States is that they regard His Majesty* s Government ga their natural protector both within the four earners of o n Treaty obligations, and outside them. This in ‘dy opinion ia outstanding and permanent factor which in all important issues is at the back of the minds of the rulers and their people, and its local importance cannot be over-estimated* The Arab Tt&amp;iea have their differences with His Haj©sty’s Government, and on occasions I daresay they find us rather a nuisance, in connection / withwith slavery for example* At the eawe time tn^ ,&lt;no« perfectly well tnat it ie only Hia ^aj ea ty*« Government mio stand between them and absorption by Ibn Ga^Jd, Iraq or Persia, and would naturally much prefer to remain as they are free and independent under their own shaikhs, a** 1 under our protection, than for the, r States to become mere districts of Saudi \raoi&amp;, or Iraq or Iran, with their present Rulers replaced by oppressive Saudi, Iraqi or Iranian officials. It is this cons iderat ion, more than any other single factor, which enables as to ♦run 1 the day-to-day administra tion of the Arab side with a handful of officials (one I evident, and three Political Agents), without the payment of a single rupee of subsidy, or the upkeep ( on our part) of a single soldier, policeman, or levy, which has a distinct and salutary effect on the minds of any particular Mhaikh and his people when on any particular occasion our interests temporal' ily clash, and which in any serious emergency, such as a major war which so nearly came upon us last September, would be of incalculable value* 5. There is in fact no doubt as to the existence of the good-will of the Arab States, but we must not fall into the bad habit - if I may P^t it that way - of taking this feeling for granted, or of assuming that it will always continue irrespective of what we do or do not do, particularly in regard to the matter of protection by His ilajesty's Government. If a feeling were ever to grow up in the Arab States that Hi® Majesty* s Government were inclined to take their responsibilities in this matter too lightly the effect would be most unfortunate, and to speak frankly there have been occasions of late years when it has seemed to me that a line of policy suggested by His Majesty** Government would - if carried out - have given this impression to the local iulera /and4 and tmir peoples. Some years ago, for instance, His Majesty’s Govermerit in order to assist the Iraq Government in the matter of checking smuggling from Kuwait, though it was com. a on ground that juridically this was a matter for the Iraq Government to deal with, were in favour of bringing 'pressure* to bear on the Shaikh in order to induce him to co-operate with the Iraqi authorities. I was strongly opposed to this suggestion, in which I had the support of the Government of India, and finally for 'pressure* was substituted 'advice**. Recently also the suggestion by the foreign Office on the subject of the sale of Khar &amp;1 Odeid to Ibn Baud appeared to me, as to the India Office and the Government of India, to be open to serious objections. On the other hand the firm line taken lately by Hie Majesty*• Government in the matter of hostile Iraqi propaganda against i Kuwait has had an excellent effect, not only at Kuwait but else- where on the Arab side of the Gulf. 'pressure* should be applied to the Rulers of the \r&amp;b states to take some particular course of action, among the arguments adduced have been those of 'the wider issues involved* either in peace or in the event of a major war. /hatever validity the 'wider issue* argument may have held in the past it has in s number of oil-fields potential as well as actual, is a wide enough issue to compete successfully with most other issues in this part of the world, both from the peace and the war point of view, while the recent ’discovery* of a possible alterrm- J _ ... 4 ^ r* A vi Vt m ex aAt\ 4* It 4 + 01 &lt;* -t'?* ax 4* Oi? 4 /I « 1 I tW YU m* 4* _ 6. /hen it has been suggested - in cases such as above ray opinion little to-day. The Arab side of the Gulf, a link on the Imperial Air Route to India and beyond, and the site of tive military motor route from the head of the Gulf to the editor--5- 7 ValuaOle ua has been the good-will of the .cab at at ea in the peat it will, in soy opinion, be atil-^ more Taluable in the future. The whole of the Arab aide it changing, fluid with extraordinary rapidity. In the laat ten years from a col de it has become an international highway of the first importance. Oil-fielda are springing up. Into certain of the Arab 3 t*tee aoney la pouring in, and in all of them new ideas are fermenting. Two recent movements at Kuwait and 3ubai are significant cases in point. A few years ago these movements would have taken the form of an attempt, whether successful or not, of a rival to pot aim- self in the position of the Shaikh, nowadays, however, these movements took the democratic form of the people in general gett.-ng more power into their own hands. There is much in ray personal opinion that is healthy in these movements, and in any case waetner we like them or not we must make the beet of them since under modern conditions they are inevitable. But they ''iU equally inevitably bring in their train difficulties of the some nature with which we have been only too familiar elsewhere, in India and 3»ypt, for example, to compare very large States to very small ones. There has recently been agitation in Bam- r in, accompanied by minor labour troubles in the oil-field, and both there and in Kuwait Youth Movements have arisen, neither labour troubles nor the Youth Movement are as yet serious, but (and this is a factor which must not be ignored merely because it is a truism) with every year that passes the youths are growing into young men. exercising more and more influence in the States, while behind them mare and more boys are following in their footsteps. If the young Bahraini in a recent letter tfeignW&amp;n *r ot e s / *Incra&amp;sed0 ’♦Increased educational facilities in recent years have produced a class of youn^ men with a veneer of education who respond readily to press propaganda, listen to broad casts and develop political feelings* They believe them selves to be progressive and despise their illiterate parents who, since the youths are earning quite good wages, have lost all influence over them. They are nationalistic, especially since they see foreigners earning more money than they themselves do* They icnovr that they are better educated than the ruling family and are inclined therefore to despise them. They come mainly from Hanaraah and Muharraq, and most of them wor* with the Oil Company, in Government offices and with firms in Manamah. * Uut at is mutandis this is an exact description of a large number of young Indians, Egyptians, Palestinians, and Iraqis. Arab States, whether for good or ill, are being broken up, as they have been in so many other Asiatic countries, but even nore rapidly, and with this break up will come the inevitable consequen ces already indicated. Come of the local agitations and movements will be directed against the local Kulera, but some will certainly be directed against us, in fact is already being directed against us. Hardly a fortnight passes without an attack being made in the Arab Press of Iraq, Palestine, Syria, or *gypt, against d is Majesty’s Government and its policy towards the Arab states ox the Gulf. under the convenient term of »*colonia&amp;tion** accusations are sometimes brought that it is our policy to disunite the M*ab and on other occasions to unite ciiems in each case for 8. Briefly then the old patriarchal conditions of life in the / our0 u- ov/a nefairiaua ends; tnat -ie undermine the independence of the 3 tatee# and use our influence to favour our subjecta and fore*^nere generally to the detriment of the local &lt;«r&amp;b; and &amp;o forth and go on. It ia all va^ua aod unsuhataiit ial, ^«d at present does not perhaps cut much ice, tout then a large proportion of ant i-'irit ish propaganda all over the world is of the same fonaleas character ehich does not prevent it from having considerable effect. % 9 . I foresee therefore difficult years aaead of us in the Arab States our policy towards which will have to toe most carefully conducted, and the first step towards this object is a realisation by all the Authorities concerned witn USMS hilf of the change that has taken place in these States. It is no longer a case of more or leas compliant Shaikhs ruling over more or lees submissive peoples, tucked a*ay in an obscure comer of the ^orid. ^he compliancy of the shaikhs can no longer be tacen for granted on all occasions, and in reply to a threat of -pressure' - &amp;« I 9 oln%- ed out in the case of the Shaikh of Kuwait quoted in paragraph to ®*&gt;OT. -Imrl quite ca 9 .de of taxing a firm stand, in which case since His Majesty's aovsrnmsnt are - quite rightly - opposed to certain drastic mens ires which certain other Ow.rnsiente would not hesitate to adopt the threat loses much of its potency. 3 ut eren supposing the Shaikhs are prepared to yield to ;Ji« Majesty's Oorernment there are now their people whe in all oX the States are acquiring mere power through the force of public opinion, who in some of the States have already acquired regularly constituted Councile, and who in the majority of the states in my opinion will in the course of the next few years obtain similar institution.. (Much the same moweaent is going on to-day m the Indian States.) It is therefore no longer merely a question of wringing a reluctaat consent from a Huler to our proposals, out of careful consideration / ofof what tn« effect of qjcc proposals may be on his people, b or does the plot ire stop there. Beyond the Gulf is the Arab world which in these days takes a definite interest in Quit affairs, (Ibn Baud displayed considerable interest for example in the recent anti-Kuwait Iraqi propaganda and actually proposed inter vening on behalf of Kuwait), and in which His Kajesty* s Government have important interests in ;»aud i Arabia, .«raq, i?ale#tine fend n^/pt. Any steps we take locally ther*efore imre their reper cussions, for good or otherwise, in those countries. In view of all these oonsiderat ions -pressure-policy* is in my opinion a two-edged weapon, ary A before using it in &amp;ny particular case His Majesty’s 0overnment should reflect most carefully wAether they are prepared to face a * show-down 1 on the part of the it alert and tneir peoples, with the attendant repercussions in the Gulf and out*id# it. there is the further important consideration that in the difficult times ahead of us our chief aainstay will be the feeling in the Arab states that Hie r&amp;Jesty’a aoveraser*t stand between them and absorption by their neighbours, anvi anything which weakens this feeling will add considerably to our difficulties. 10. To sum up* (a) our ’rule* over the Arab States of the Gulf rests on the good-will of the Rulers and their peoples, partly self- int.rusted good-will no doubt, but none the less firm for that reason* the best basts for good-eiU is not sentiment but self- interest. This good-*ill enables our day-to-day administration to be carried on economically, works in our fa*our whenever a difference in opinion arises between the Mates and ourselves, and in case of an emergency, such «s a major war which was eo nearly upon us last 3 epte&gt;aaer, would be of great value. / (b&gt;-9- (b) This good-#iH depends on turee tmln factors. ?rrBt - the faot tn&amp;t as far as possible we let the Eulers and tneir people, under our guidance and advice, manage their o^n affairs in their own way. Second - the fact that in our various negotiat ions with the Eulers, in which of course their peoples are interest ed, on the subject of oil, air facilities and so forth, we give them a patient hearing and a square deal, third - and most important - the idlers and their peoples realise that it is only Hi» Majesty*s Government who protect them from absorption by their stronger neighbours. (c) Owing to modern democratic developments in the States there are difficult times ahead of us, and we must be careful, all the more so because of the much increased strategical and political importance of the *rab side in recent years, to continue in the future the main lines of our policy which have served us well in the past. Above all we must avoid taking any step which would lessen the confidence which at present the states have in His Majesty*« Government as their natural protector. # I am lending a copy of this letter to i eel.

Sir, o-r o , rov ,-K ^ have the honour to inform you that as a result Z h o uli request you made to me whilst you were embarked regardi no- ^ reham » I . ; |} ave caused investigation to be made Ajman^ ing ^ Possibility of bombarding the Sheikh’s fort at QOQwr Th ® For '? situated behind Ajman town when looking from oe^v/ard, and there are practically no structures on the landward side of the fort. The confines of the town, hov/ever, approach to within about 50 yards of the fort on the seaward side. Most^ of the houses adjacent to the fort are of palm one or ^ wo more solid structures lie with in j. 00 yards distance. Bombardment from directly to seaward, i.e. from a westerly direction is considered not to be practicable without great risk of damage to the surroundine r property. &amp; A clear line of fire with practically no obstruction could be obtained from a south-westerly direction; but in these circumstances the slightest deviation for line would cause the shell to pitch in the town. Further it is thought that even if the fort only were hit directly, the burst of a 4-inch H.E. shell inevitably would cause damage to surrounding property. Bombardment of the fort is considered therefore not to be a practicable proposition, unless damage to surrounding property can be accepted. r*. Political Agent, The Agency, BAHRAIN.
