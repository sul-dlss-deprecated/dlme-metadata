The cargo in question was discharged from the steamer whilst she was still aground and before arrival of the steamer at this port, for the safety of the steamer and the goods themselves. If consignees goods are fully insured, consignees can re cover the deppeit from their Underwriters in due course on production of their original Deposit Receipts. Consignees cannot obtain delivery of their goods until the deposit is paid and the General Average bond is signed. In the absenc of any Invoices or certified copy of them, we think, the value will have to be assessed. The amount of deposit is fixed by the Steamship Company. Every possible care was taken to land the cargo safely and to protect it while in our charge. lours faithfully, MOHAMBD SHAKIE H. KUTBUDDIN AWAZI &amp; CO. Agents, Hansa Line. pMOHAMED SHARIF H.

The original point pt issue is being evaded. Will you please oblige by quoting that particular clause in the Bill of Lading authorising you to collect 6 % on the invoice value. With reference to para 2 your contention is without any proofs supported by the Bahrein G-overnment authorities. It is a surprising point to note - because the risk is realizable by the underwriters - therefore the consignees should blindly pay without ascertaining the legality of the payment. As regards the production of the invoice your reply is ridiculous. We have never claimed that we are not in possession of invoices but have strong objections to show you our Invoices which possibly might turn out detrimental to our cause as we are not prepared to disclose such things to our trade rivals. With reference to the amount of deposit which is to be fixed by the steamship companies as alleged by you, we have to demand the copy of the said rule under which 5 % is intended to be recovered, We do not know what has transpired between you and the steam ship Coy and unless we have a copy of the same we are not in a position to reply thereto. io declare a certain oercentafTO on the ^oods there must be certain stipulated regulations and not that the matter be left to the goodwill of the agents who can make a mountain of a mole and take undue advantage of the occasion.

We would however point out that Ship owners in the case of a general average, are entitled to require fron consignees of cargo security for the payment which shall te eventually be found due from each and can demand the deposit before delivery of the cargo.

TUCMORANDUM : - In reference to the General Average declared by s.s. 'Barenfels' upon its cargo, I have to report that this morning a meeting took place at the Customs, presided over by Yourself, at which were present:- The steamers Agent, K.B.Muhumnad Sharif Awazi, for the Hansa Company, Messrs Tickandas Isardas, and Kishendas Haridas, for the importers concerned, and myself, ex parte. The position was made clear to the Agent, and to the Importers, who perused the General Average^ftH?ch they are asked to sign. It was agreed that I should act as Trustee on of the concerned, to see that the Bond was duly signed, aira^tTne: relative deposits of five per cent of the value of the respective imports, to lodge same into the Eastern Bank Limited, and to remit same according to the instructions of the Hansa Company. I should be pleased to have your approval to this course of action, when I shall notify the Agent accordingly, as without such notification he declines to accept the position, and hand to me the proper receipt forms. PORT OFFICER. BAHREIN. No pa/ga///^— r\ Ho 'Sk/S,/ H.B.M's Political Agent, BAHREIN. THE CUSTOMHOUSE, BAHREIN. 12th December, 1929 11th Rajab, 1348 * MEMORANDUM:- s.s.” Barenfels” G-eneral Average In accordance with your instructions, I have to report that yesterday morning I gave an interview to the following local merchant s: Hindus : Messrs Dhamanmal Isardas, Kishendas Haridas, Shewakram, Borah Abbasbhai Hathimbhai, l4 . . ,, • i A/t Persian : Hajy Muhur mad Tayyib Khunjy, and The Agent of the Hansa Line, K.B.Muhummad Sharif, did not attend, having sent a specious plea that he was busy. I discussed the position with the merhhants, and told them: 1. Undoubtedly an accident had occured to the steamer, on which it was entitled to declare General Average, and consequently all importers, at every port, are rateably liable for the expenses of saving the ship and cargo. 2. Since thegg amount of these expenses cannot be ascertained at once, all Bahrein consignees must enter into a Bond, and pay a deposit to secure the amount of such rateable shares. This Bond must be signed in your presence as Notary Public, and, and the amount of the deposit would be calculated by me, and reported to you, on the basis of five per cent of the value declared on the Bill of Entry. The merchants agree to this; butlthey ask that you would be good enough to receive these deposits from them, for transmission to the Hansa Company. I said that I thought you would possibly agree to this. 3. The merchants complain that their Delivery Orders are being delayed by the Agent, while he has issued^ Cargo Delivery Orders to himself as Importers; and the suggestion is that the agent is taking advantage of the situation in order to get into the market first with his goods, which is possibly quite correct. I advised them to inform the Agent that they are prepared to enter into the Bond, and lodge the necessary deposits, and to apply for their Delivery Orders at once. Failing deli the issue, 1 would advise them to ask the Government of Bahrein to authorise the delivery of the cargo on the Bills of Lading as prrof of title. This morning K.B.Muhummad Sharif called upon me, and explained that he is ordered by his Company (copy telegram herewith) to obtain the bond and collect the deposit. Also, he has instructions through Mr G.A.Worley, the Busreh Agent of this line, as to procedure (Copy herewith). He has also shewn me a cop v of the Bond, which appears to me to be the usual form. _ I told him of the merchants’ attitude, and that his action in issuing Delivery Orders to himself, and delaying other orders, would not make for good feeling between himself and the other merchants. He agreed to this, and also/bo the Bo £ d signed before you, and to my adjusting the amounts of the deposits. Therefore, with your approval, I propose to report to you as each Bill of Entry is lodged in the Customs, the amount of five per cent of the declared value, and at the same time x shall request each importer to attend at your office to sign the Bond and lodge his deposit. When he produces to me the Deposit receipt I will grant delivery of his import to mm. 1 'venture to suggest that 1 .

Thir Uerman steamer, Hans a Line, laden v/ith various merchandise, mostly sugar, v;hile making the port of Bahrein, went aground on the Fesht al Djibal, on a bottom of mi&gt;ed mud sand, but not coral. and The Persian Gulf Sailing directions state in regard to this neighbourhood .'Gi. ........ care must be taken TT on account of an unreliable dVift which flows chiefly from East to West and vice-versa. It was decided by a Naval Court of Enquiry in re 'Patrick Stewart', which aground 6n this spot in 1927, that because the ship went aground, such care had not been exercised, and the accident therefore was due to negligence. s.s.Barenfels was steaming at 12 knots, and drawing 23'6'. When she went aground, at high tide her depth was 19’3', or 4’3' too little. Hence to float she should decrease her depth by at least 4’6' probably S’O', or the high tides should rise higher, which in fact they 0 ? the moon being waxing. It seemed likely that 2,754 tons represented the difference in her draught, as she loads 51 tons to the inch. This ship went aground on the second day of the moon, which increases, and the tides with it, up to the full moon, and gqt off on her ov/n power on the 9th day of the moon. r in the interval, on Wednesday the 5th December, (third day of the moon) the Busreh Agent came ashore, and on 6th December discussed the position with me. It seemed possible, in order to float the ship, that a portion of her cargo should be lightered. He proposed to jettison sufficient cargo for this purpose. But since the Fesht al Djibal is only 40 miles from Bahrein, and the ship's normal anchorage would have teen at the Outer Buoy, ten miles from Manamah, I recommended that the Bahrein should first be lightered out of the ship, at the Fesht al Djibal, (14,697 packages), and then, if the ship did not float on her own power, with the increasing tides, a decision could be made at to lightering, or jettisoning. The s.s.'Sonnenfels? was summoned from Busreh, to stand by tor other ports' cargoes, and duly arrived. Subject to the steamer's outturn, it may be assumed that all the Bahrein cargo was duly lightered, and landed. In the meanwhile the ship's local Agent declared General Average on all the cargo, in anticipation of damage to some part of it, and demanded that local consignees shoul U)^ ^ ?t ter imnort/’° n iA the meanwhile°the issue of local cargo Delivery a; {g3.tr lodefged the usual p g te ' f V ral or particular Average, with the^neares^Consul^r^ig^Sea^Authority, that he fears damage-*w~ r\ II. B.M's Political Agent, Hence, can it be assumed continued. 2 . +—A (1) that no damage has been suffered, and (2) that the lightering of the Bahrein ca^go was the ordinary work of discharge at an intermediate port, oitb&amp;n effort to save the whole ship from damage ? (It will be remembered that the ship made the port of Bahrein on her ov/n power) By Royal Mail Steam Packet Co. v. English Bank of Rio Janeiro (1887), 19 Q.B.D.362 it is laid down that ’’Cargo which has been landed to ensure its safety, and not for the purpose of lightening the ship is not liable to contribute in respect of a general average loss subsequently incurred”, but I suggest that this does not apply. If (3) was the true reason, then General Average ought to be declared, and all consignees of her cargo must bear rateably the cost of preserving it,provided that there was no negligence. If there was negligence, such General Average expenses should be borne by the ship (i.e.The Hansa Company), and not by the consignees. Further, in my opinion, General Average cannot be declared or assessed at an intermediate port, but at the port of ultimate destination (Busreh) only, and then only after the ship's Captain's Protest at the nearest intermediate port, Bahrein. The osts to be shared by the consignees would appear to be (1) Cost of Lighterage between the Fesht al Djibal and the Outer Buoy, and , , , . (2) Cost of bringing s.s.Sonnenfels to stand by, and her return to Busreh. The rate of expenses should be based on the value of the cargo to the ship, not to the Importers, or the Customs at Bahrein. This value is basedTH the freight paid for its carriage e.g. so muc much per ton, cubic or weight, and can easily be ascertained at the port of its shipment, or possibly (though unlikely) from e importers' invoices, or Bills of Lading. I would point out that the ship need not ordinarily cive delivery of its cargo until such General Average ispaid; but for convenience, it is usual for the con ® 16n !r e ^ solvency Bond to pay this amount. If there is any doubt about the solve } of such bond, a deposit could be lodged by each importer. that ( 1 ) any luch ?ond°sho^rhe^^ven'cnly^o'or 'in'the^presince BUT, since (1) no hafheeS*su?ferei. and r 3 ) h iaLein“n?y an Infe Wiat^port, and not the port of destination (Simonds v.

We axe in receipt of yomr letter No*GA/&amp;/ 13£/395 of yester days date and note that you have lodged in the Eastern Bank Ltd., the stan of Rs. 14-14-0 being the last deposit that was collected in Bahrein on account of the (general Average of the above steamer. As regards the two cases of Beer, which,v r e believe, ,r ere sent by the Hansa Company as a Christmas present, we do not know wheth er they should be exempt from General Average, but think that these also should share the General Average in the same v/ay, as you know, w« ourselves paid the General Average deposit on one case of Chocolates which was also sent as a Christinas present by the Hansa Company. The letter to which you refer as having been sent to us by you for our signature with instructions to the Eastern Bank Ltd., re lates only to the last deposit of Rs.14—14-0, and this letter we coulc not sign as we did not agree to some of the wording in it. We thank you for the Cash Statement sent, but regret ve cannot see our way to check it, as requested, as we had no facilities, as you know, to inspect the relative Invoices of the Consignees in this case. We regret, we on our own, cannot accept your fourth para graph that you consider your concern in the position is at an end, until we have heard from our Principals as to what responsibilities there may be in the valuation of the goods or the collection of the deposits, etc., etc., for the purposes of the Average Adjusters ap pointed, and we also cannot give any decision at present in this res^ pect as it was not with our consent that you were appointed the Trustee. For the same reason therefore we are as yet unable to take , over from you the Deposit Receipt Book. We are comnnmicating with our Principals and on hearing from them shall advise you. With regard to the remittance of Rs. 14-14-0 we shall sign the necessary letter of instructions to the Eastern Bank on receiving a reply from you to our letter of 6th January in which we have raised objection to the commission already charged. In the meantime we can arrange to remit a sum of Rs. 14-14-0 to our Busrah Agents and ask- 2 them to add this on to the previous deposits remitted. tfe further beg to point out that we have not yet received your reply to our letters dated 6th and 9th January in connection with the completion of the Valuation Forms by each consignee, we % could not undertake this work ourselves, as, we are afraid, the consignees will again give trouble and refuse to comoly with our i** request. If however, we will get the necessary helo from Political Agent, in the event of their refusing, we shall be pleased to undertake the work on hearing from you. In your letter of 24th December you informed us that the » total collections that date amounted to Rs. 10407-9-0 and you asked us for our concurrence to remit at least ten thousand rupees. We immediately replied to you on same date that sooner the money would reach the Company the better would it be in the interest of all concerned. we shall be obliged therefore if you will kindly advise us, for information of the Company, as to why no remittance was made before the 5th January.

Copy to Political Agent, Bahrein for information in conti nuation with our previous letters.No PA/GA/A THE CUSTOMHOUSE, BAHRAIN: 15th January, 1930. 15th Shaban, 1348. © I have to report that on 3rd December, 1929, s. s. 'Barenf els”, a Hansa steamer, bound for .Bahrein, went aground on the Fesht al Djibal. This steamer carried for Bahrein: Sugar, . . Ironware, Vermicelli Cement, . Sundries, 12,275 packages, 1,107 ' . 1,000 ' . 250 ' 65 ' Total:- 14,697 The local agent for this line is K.£.Kuhummad Sharif H. Kutbuddin Awazi; but the Busreh Agent, Mr G.Worley, of the African &amp; Eastern (Near East) Ltd, was on board the ship,and was landed at Bahrein. In order to lighten the ship, the local Agent decided first to remove the Bahrein cargo; but in view of the distance and the stormy weather, local craft refused to out. K.B.Muhummad Sharif and the local Lloyd’s Sub-agent appealed to me for assistance, and as a result of my efforts local craft went out, and the cargo was landed in due course. The Busreh Agent took charge of arrangements, and the steamer declared General Average on all its cargo, and required a deposit of 5?&amp; of the value of their imports from the consignees of its cargo. s. s.’’Sonnenfels”, then lying empty in Busreh, was brought here to assist in lightering the cargo for other ports, but was not needed. For certain reasons (K.B.Muhammad Sharif being a large importer of sugar, as well as steamer's agent) local consignees of s. s. 'Barenfels 1 ’ 'cargo objected to producing their invoices to the agent, and the payment of the deposit; but, following upon certain interviews with Yourself, when the position was made clear to the merchants, it was decided, with your approval, that these deposits should be collected jointly by K.B.Muhummad Sharif and myself, and be lodged in The Eastern Bank Ltd., for remission according to the Hansa Company's instructions. K.B.Muhummad Sharif was present at the last meeting, and agreed to the-la this arrangement, which has been duly carried into effect. At first he worked closely with me; but after receipt of correspondence from the Busreh Agents, he took an attitude of critical objection. K.B.Muhummad Sharif paid the first deposit to me, he being a large importer ex this steamer apart from his position as local Agent. On 24th December, 1929, I wrote to K.B.Muhummad Sharif suggesting the remittance of Ten thousand rupees to the Hansa Company.H.B.] 1 s Political Agent Continued K.B.muhummad Sharif replied that he was unable to say anything until he received further instructions from the Company, 'to whom I have already written fully, but we ’’merely signed the receipts at the desire of the Political 'Agent'. From this it seemed right to wait until such instructions came. However, bearing in mind the expense of remission and the fact that considerable out-payments would have to be made in Bahrein, I enquired if it would save expense by not remitting the cash to Bremen , and suggested that a Cash Statement should however be sent, to shew the posit ion. 1 .B. Muhummad Sharif preferred that the cash should be despatched ’the sooner the better’, and of course I agreed. During the preparation of the Cash Statement (wnich had to be altered as more deposits were paid), K.B.Muhummad Sharif called with a letter from The African &amp; Eastern (Hear East) Ltd requesting the remission of the deposits to Busreh. I suggested an instruction to the Eastern Banx Ltd that their Busreh Branch should credit this firm with amount in balance here by a letter of advice, which I thought was the simplest method. K.B.Muhummad Sharif agreed, and the instruction was duly sent to the Eastern Bank Lta., who arranged the credit accordingly, and in the usual course of business charged one per cent for the remission. K.B.Muhuminad Sharif then took objection to the whole position on the ground that, had the ^ r een originally paid to him, he would not have c ^rged commission for the remission, and he understood the Eastern Bank’s remission would be free of charge. I had some trouble in collecting the last deposit; hut when this was effected, I du ltion ani i forwarded VSe ^ te . b r alan ° e informe^him^hat^I^ considered ^afS concern in the position was at an end, and I should be pleased if he would inspect and agree the account, and take over the Official Receipt Book etc., To this suggestion, however, K.B.Muhummad Sharif does not agree; and the present position seems to be that (a) he refuses to agree to my being concerned with him in the collection of the deposits, and (b) he refuses to agree to my withdrawing from such concern. 1 think the explanation is that in (a) he is following the line ^6 Busreh Agents, and in (b) he does not hr^n^th^deposits v, e avy detail work which follows the collection of the deposits. llmight also be mentioned that his letters are written in ■pn^lish bv a clerk borrowed from another local firm, possibly 0 the signed does not understand the exact meaning nf* the phrases used. I am therefore writing to K.B. Muhummad Sharif :onfirming my withdrawal from th * jL ?e ll to report the position to you, and I trust my latitude has your approval.
