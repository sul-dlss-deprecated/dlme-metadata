The Ministry of Communications say they have allotted Rials 4,00C,000 to the Shiraz area, for roads - a sum which compares very favourably with the allocations for other areas. They state that they have already sent'Rials 400,000 for the period 21st March to 21st May and will send Rials 500,000 for the third Persian month ending June 21.

From the latest Tehran telegram it seems clear that, if we want any repairs to be done to this road beyond what the Persians can be induced to carry out themselves, we shall have to provide a good deal more help than Prior originally envisaged. We doubt if the road can be considered of such importance to our interests as to justify the provision of the military staff and money which would be necessary and we therefore feel that, political considerations apart, it would be better to drop the idea of taking direct action for the improvement of the road.

Bushire Roa*d . It is not improbable that activity of a British Military engineer on this road might arouse suspicion. It is time that the Persian Government began to do something for itself. Since occupation we have maintained roads, collected grain, and in other ways stood between Persians and self-help. If they will not repair road by which essential oil supplies reach Shiraz, one of the most important towns in Persia, they might as well become an autonomous Republic of the Soviet Union at once. It is, I admit, infuriating to see essential jobs neglected for want of a little foreign vigour, but that is the difficulty throughout the East, and more and more we are having to use indirect instead of direct methods, even at the cost of a great loss of efficiency.

The Russian then went speak of ^avarn ul Mulk and to ask whether Hurray had not been C lt-~v^y on removed because he was anti-British and that the present finances, philll-n, was working much more closely with us. 11. Mr. i.^artchenko called on the deputy Muaddel who received him for what proved to be a ^hree-hour interview consulate to ask what he should say. from uhe account lie ^ave of the interview he seems to have been at no loss foi the consul :.Iar tchcnko and and to have oubject Director of before he caiufe to the subsequent ly words, to been the him to a have amused himself at the expense of only person to turn the tables on Mr* series of questions. 12. In general Mr. Llartchenko 1 s questions seem not to have varied very much from Lhose he asked elsewhere and /ere chiefly concerned with Qavam ul Mulk, the tribes, the local political parties, 'Ourselves and the economic situation. According to nuaddel however IT. :arochenKo said that Russia had been asleep for the last twenty pears during which the British had acquired great influence in Persia in all classes from merchants upwards. They .ihe Russians must make up lor lost time among the working classes. Muaddel said that the Russians would never maKe headway in Persia because in Persia there were not the extremes of riches’ and poverty that had existed in Czarist Russia. If the Russians wished to acquire influence in the country '/hey should take ouc their troops. Mr. artchenko said ^hao t ere were three great powers in the world (Muaddel said he had a crack at lis omitting China and France) and the small nations must attach themselves to the great ones. Persia was a small nation and must attach itself to its great neighbour. Muaddel told v the consul that he was talking in terms of Afghanistan and India and that Persia was great in its own eyes* Hr. Marlchenko asked whether in the opinion of Muaddel the Soviet should send a representative (namayandeh) of a consul to Bhiraz and Muaddel replied that there were no Russian interests here so that neither was necessary. 13. Mr. Martchenko asked uaddel why he had not gone to ffnran and which fraction he intended to join when he .vent there. Muaddel said he gave the retort that when he was in the hoz he would xnow how to swim.- Muaddel then asked Mr. !artchenxo questions on Isfahan and ohe Russian said the Isfahanis were hopeless and asked now the bhiiazis were and uadclel replied M wors 0 **. Mr. artonenko sai^u tli q~ e .vas no difference between saram ud Deal eh and avam ul Mulk except that -^avam was meaner. On the subject of political parties r. Martchenko asked Muaddel why he supoorted the Denrocrat parcy. u uaddel said it \vc~o because he was a democrat, ev ryone was a democrat now and the war was being fought for democracy. 14. Mr. Martchenko and the Colonel and an interpreter cal^ea me on &gt; nary 14. He re .eated the suggestion to me that Qavam ul Mulk aimed at becoming Governor-General of Rare again. 'hen he questioned me about Maser Qashgai I told him ohat Naser Qashgai having arranged tribal security on the west of Fare was new similarly occupied on the east. He asked me why qavam and Naser had become reconciled and I saia I thought it was a natural cmsequence of Naser 1 s handing over the Germans. In the last war the Qashgai had supported the Germans and in this war they had sheltered them. Qavam had always been pro-ally and Nas^r by coming over to the side of the allies would naturally rind himself on a new and friemly footing with -avam. Mr. Martchenko asked for an explanation of the Ab Gineh meeting and as I Know of no reasonable explanation I could-only say that it was an act oi stupidly, on the part of Fhosrow Qashgai who was a r ere child, a the Governor-General had been both surprised and annoyed aud I myself saw no point in it particularly as Naser was on his way to &gt;hiraz ^ w as then due to arrive two days after the meeting in question. I told .^ Martchenico that so far as I xaew there was ^^H^ ^LaQuch feared t at these were the most restless of the trices ana muon xuaieu by their neighbours. Mr. Martchenko asked whether arms and anruniticn were reaching the tribes from Bahrein and Kowait and I said that there was3 was no evidence to support that supposition. Such equipment as the tribes were receiving came I understood from material stolen Khuzestan. Martch e n ko asked me how many local newspapers there were 'vha^ was their inf luence. I told him that the better newspapers r e I ver^ FOOd Presentation of world problems but that the Surush and Oailntm (thus mentioning the two Tudeh newspapers without identifying them 'with the Tudeh Party) were almost exclusively concerned with lo matters.

His Majesty's Consul, Bushire to sipabbud shahbakhti, Commander of the Forces in the South ana Governor General of the seventh us tan. Your Excellency, I write to confirm the conversation which I had with your Excellency on February 26th, when I had the honour to call on you at Shiraz. 2. ^e discussed the security and disarmament situation in the Bushire area, orujuMch you invited me to give my views, i expressed the hope that with your coming to Shiraz, shoula see the endend of the policy of weakness, of conciliation of petty chiefs, of distribution of arms, v\hich has in the past year done so much to bring the administration of the imperial Government into disrepute in my consular area. I pointed out that the problem was not one that called for any consi derable dispersion of troops from the forces at Your Excellency’s disposal; and suggested that the moral effect alone of restoration by the army of law and order in this area was one that would well repay the effort required.i informed your Excellen cy that many of the chiefs in Tangistan and Dashti were at loggerheads with each other, and suggested that the present moment was most opportune for a vigorous display of strength, i argued that, so long as such petty chiefs were allowed to loot, smuggle, misappropriate foodstuffs, resist the collection of wheat and generally defy authority in the Bushire area ( which is supposed to be a settled area), it was not to be expected that tribal leaders in other areas would be disposed to take seriously even such a proclamation as one whicfc Your Excellency has recently issued on this subject. 3. your Excellency informed me that it was your intention to restore order tn the Bushire area no less than in other parts of South Persia, and that without delay. 4. in matters of detail, I drew your Excellency’s attention to various points, which we re : - (i) The coastal area is long and narrow, a fact which emphasises the importance of communicatix The provision of some lorries is essential, and also of a lauch for communication with the isxxx coastal ports, a 60-H.P. launch used to be at the disposal of the Bushire Customs; but it was sent(iv)/ to Khorramshahr at the time of the date season. Now, although the date season is ended, it has not been returned, i had mentioned this to Sarhang Khosrowdad on his visit to Bushire, and he promised to take action on his retuarn to Shiraz. (ii) if purely infantry forces are sent to achieve disarmament in this area, it is certain that there will he resistance ana bloodshed. But if modern weapons, such as guns and mortars, are at the disposal of the commander of the Government forces, there is a very good chance of toe object t being achieved without cost in view of the a^sunioriS of the local leaders. This consideration also makes the despatch of a reasonable force of infantry a more economical proposition in toe long run than the provision of a single company from the Bushire garrison, as the present orders stand. , / ^ m T' M fi Kl w- (iii) I spoke to your Excellency of the/diviaec command, and instanced the expedition against All Ismail Dayyir last year, when your Excellency’s predecessor in the ustandari attached a certain Sheikh Abdullah Borazani to the headquarters of the Gendarmerie commander, sarwan isfandian, witn the result that the expendition was entirely, frujbless. I therefore urged your Excellency not tee- to prejudice the action which you are about to initiate by a similar division of authority and responsibility, in particular, was^not able to regard Sargurd Yasuf Nuri as a suitable officer for employment on such a task, as he had in the last year been instrumental in negotiating a pact with the petty local khans of this area^by which were confirmed in their areas of authority, and given Government arms- a policy which i was only able to describe/ to your Excellency as weax and unsoldierly.(iv) The small Gendarmerie garrison on the coast at Dayyir and Lavar are not forces hut targets; and I pressed the need for withdrawing them and grouping them with ether troops as a striking force. The possibility of doing this, however, depends on the® provision of a launch, which I haa mentioned earlier. (v) I finally expressed the hope that, as soon as the task of disarmament had been successfully completed, a suitable Bakhsdar might be sent to Ah ram ? in order to restore the prestige of the Imperial Government’s administration in this area. 5. your Excellency took note of these points, anc I have now only to thank you for giving me your attention on this matter. I avail myself etc. Sd/-J. B. Howes. His Britannic Majesty’s consul, B u s h i r e. Copy sent under Printed Letter No.II/ b- 173-S dated 2nd March 1943 to Tehran, Shiraz and Lt.-Col.

To devise the beet method of protecting the roaa fort (a) free running (b) Convoy running, of Aid to Russia vehicles* My general impression is that the military problem involved in the protection of the road is a comparatively simple one* Unfortunately, the problem is far more complex and involves many factors which at present contribute to insecurity and which need consideration and adjustment to fit in with the general security plan. These factors ere reviewed below. Topographical, Traversing the route ISfAHAh - BUaHlKjJi (and back), 1 was impressed hot by the difficult nature of the country adjacent to the road but by the facility with which movement nan be effected over it in dryteeather. The valleys are broad, long stretches of the road run along open plains, and the passes are the only - though serious - obstacle to move ment, It is pointed out elsewhere - Appx t A f - that the alignment of the road 3HIRAZ - BU3HIR&amp; was fortuitous* It is unsuitable and entails a great strain on M*T, If the recommendations regarding the proposed re-alignment of parts of the road and the construction of the alternative route, details of which are to be found in paras 9 - 11 of Appx ’A*, are adopted, not only wii.iL Hie strain cm f ,T. be relieved but the security of the ro&amp;d will be facilitated, ana other desirable objects,e,g* the providing of work for tbe tribes men, will be achieved. Present security situation, I am impressed not so much by what the tribes have done but by what, under existing conditions, they could have, but have no t done* The length of the road (492 miles) mitigates against 100 ^ security even by a large and efficient force against &amp; determined enemy,but to date, no very determined enemy has appeared, and even a small mobile force should prove a sufficient deterrent to e raiding unprofitable and to render the route sufficiently secure for all purposes. In the past 11 months there have been about 76 incidents’on this road. Bb no ne&amp;ns have all of these been directed against our kiT.j rather the reverse. The majority of these incidents refer to the molesting of road workers, and to the robbing of single civilian lorries, and in this connection the frequency with which the ood bags of sugar are 'looted* makes one suspicioudof the veracity of some of the reports* Be that as it may, in only onecase has part of any organised convoy been held up (i,e* the Russian incident)* There is no evidence x&amp; that any of these *hold ups have been made by large parties or that there has been a concerted and continuous operation against this L of C* Sporadic raiding is a fitter description of what has been happening; a few gun&gt;«en out for loot* That this could have been dealt with by the Persian authorities themselves is all too ap, arent.2 H«M*Consul at ^KIHA^ is of the opinion that ne&amp;r-ty all the incidents South of SHIRA2 were perpetrated by tribesmen but that so;*e of the robberies near ISPAHAN last s^ritife, were eom&lt; iited bj inhabitants of villages lying near the road. 4 . Possible future developments# It wouhd be unwise in the extreme to assucie that the situation is incapable of deterioration* To my mind, what constitutes the gravest menace to security in the future is the presence with the tribes (and not only the Q,ASKi^Al) of an unknown number of Germans. These have been at large for over a year, and are still at large* It may be argued that the general improvement in the war situation and the 1 fact that the tribes have made no concerted effort discredits the influence of these Germans* This is not nece sarily so; they may be biding their tU*. There is evidence of some re-arming among the tribes; from what source is not yet I known* There is a suspicion that large pre-war German credits / in Persia have not been fro sen b^ us and are available to these Gentians* There is a suspicion that some ol tne Persian Generals and Officials have been actively intriguing with these Germans. There is the warning of the histoiy of the last war when one German (Wassmus) succeeded in tying up a complete division of ours in Persia. At best the presence of these Germans is the most effective obstacle to our entering into any satisfactory direct contact rr negotiations with those sections of the tribes which are Harbouring them* In faet, the desirability of the immediate apprehension of these Gerr-ans - by whatsoever Uienas- cannot be over emphasised &amp;• The Persian Genahmerie* All along the route I&amp;£AHAS - BU$hlR*i, well sited, are gendarmerie posts* These in themselves, suitably manned and operated, should have been capable of dealing with most ol the lawlessness which ha* occurred to date* Had these 'hold ups' occurred during the night, or in the passes, one could appreciate the difficult lee of dealing with them, but the regrettable fact remains that the majority of them have happened in broad daylight and in quite open parts and testifies to the present inefficiency of this force* Apart from the actual gendarmes, the route is littered with armed scallywags named * Cher icice ,, • Owing to the miserable conditions of service, it has been found impossible to keep the Gendarmerie up to the required strength; in consequence many of tneae outsiders have been employee (and armed) by the Persian Authorities* if rumour is to be believed these armed semi-gendarmes guard tut ro te 1 for us bv day and take their own picking* by night* In any case the presence of an indilg&amp;iplined yet ar^ed rabble can only add to the insec nty of toe road and they should either be embodied into the gendarmerie or dispensed with, and in the latter event they should be dis*armed* At the same time the advantages of giiaking use of existing organisations are obvious and it is apparent that toe gendarmerie could be t^hiBed into an efiicient force* A representative of the U.G* is already in Persia ana has outlined a scheme designed to bring about this desirable purpose but the time beiore it is fully operating is still som way distant* I suggested to Col* tZ&amp;GFf 9 U*S* representative, that until such time as his reposals come into effect it might be possible for ue to reorganise the requisite number of gendarmes (about 1,000 ) for te is route alone on the fiystem outlined in pars 2 of Appx 'A**Unfortunately this euggeetion was not well receiTed and he imde the alternative proposal which he has outlined in Appx 1 replied that though it might be possible to supply the administrative requirements there were great difficulties about training and this triple control, he was not anxious W change his view and i did not press Uu, natter. However, it appears to be advantage ous to »ia e the gendarmerie an efficient force as soon as possible,arid the following recommend* tiot s are rnadei- (i) That we snoulc agree to providing help for the static part oi toe gendarmerie as follows* Initial issue oi l t 000 blankets and 1,000 great coats. lai ly free issue of 1,000 rations at scale oi U lbs atta, 2 oz sugar and 1/5 oz tea per ration. ^Ration i^sue to cease when U.3. take over)• (ii) That these be given to the Persian Coaurander at SHIRAZ subject to his agreeing to have attached to him two British L»0*&amp; who will see that the gendarmerie actually receive their rations and function efficiently. The L.C’s to be withdrawn when the Americans take over. It is i or consiceration anu decision to wh&amp;t extent M.T. can be mace available; the sooner trie gendarmerie are capable of carrying out the mobile role, the sooner can our own forces be releasee. The amount of i.T. demanded is not very great. The Persian Army in Fare province . In SHIRAZ there is a Persian General who is also Governor General of P&amp;rs province. He has at his dis posal something like 10,000 troops. Tnere is a garrison at SHIRAZ (which includes a cavalry regt) and there, are troops at other places along the route. I understand that none of the incidents has been followed up effectively - if at ail- by the troops of the Persian Aruy notwithstanding the fact that some of them have occurred within six miles oi dHXRAZ and one hold-iip was effected within three miles of thot city. On his side tne Persian Co manner complains that he has no transport and no cor;ixounicati ons (which is true); that he can get ric confirr-ation from tne Ministry oi justice at TSHRAH to death Gcntences iaqposed on bandits by his military courts; that he l^ias not been given iwtkexBes the reinforceRient.s he iiae asked for; and that, generally, he gets no support frem TkhRA&amp;, At the same ti e it is quite obvious that he has taken no effective measures to secure the route, and the inactivity of his army is despicable. Ai v eo to this are rumours of his own complicity with the irerwans wno are at large. He has a scheme for the restoration of order among HASIR* s adherents in qdSH^Al tribes and for the elimin ation of HASXR AHAIi, but this scheme has been hanging firs fo soot t&amp;ne, said to be die to the non-arrival of asked for reinforcements. - Whatever be the cause, it is apparent that ti^e Governor of Kars is insufficiently under the control of any one and that the restitution of srder is dependent largely upon hie goodwill and that to date the existence of this goodwill has in no way been proved by unmitigated act. The Persian Government anc H.B.*.. hepation. whet applies to the Governor of SHIRAZ applies in some measurt to the wholfc Persian auth^riti?', »ucu as itbak&gt; 1 - 4 - ae it is. Ineiriciency and intrigue are aamittedly the order of ttie day. IIBM Legation opine that the situation Hi in Fare is capable of imrediate improTement by replacing the present commander at SHIRAZ by someone more suitable and by providing more transport for the Persian Army; and arrangements for the former course are already in hand. 1 agree that this is %uite possible but am insistent that real improvement in the situation will occur when increase* pressure is brought to bear by the Allied Governments and more direct control is exercised over the whoel Persian authorities. I fully realise the difficulties in obtaining this in view of the Joint Anglo •‘Russian occupation and the infilteration of U.S. represen atives but were a more positive and individual approach possible by us to some of the more influential Persians (e.g. in the Army and the Police) 80i»&lt;e of our present difficulties wuld be removed. The fact that imny of these hc,ve beenrlattrqgft* bwught by the other side matters not in the least, fcever in the history of double crossings have so many got away with so much; and we could prevent them double crossing us by exercising a stricter and more personal control by the appoint went of our own chosen officers disguised under whatever name. The arrest of the ISPAHAN Cotmander ZAHIDI, has had a good effect in many quarters, notably on the SHIRAZ Comii&amp;nder although the report was not well received in Allied political quarters. 8 . The Tribes - especially the ASHCAl. 11 is reliably stated that the economic situation of tiie ty£HQAl is no worse that that of the other tribes and is better than that of the will&amp;gers and townsfolk. There is evidence that the t^ASRC^Al have been selling wheat and acquiring arms. It would appear that the reasons for * found guilty, their displays of lawlessness are inherent rather than On the whole economic. Hor are the .&gt;SH-^AI the only tribe wtio have been the attitude *unfriendly to date. The fact that tr.e misdeeds have gone of the tribes unpunished may have encouraged them, but so far there is has not been absence of evidence tiiat the raids have been dietated by political motives. Generally speaking, no Bitl&amp;eme yet devised by British administraters for winning tribesmen to our side has added notably to the security of the areas inwhich ' tt operated (one recalls instantly decades of disaster on the jaw Frontier of India) but the especial difficulties in inducing the ASH^AI to assume responsibility for the protection of the present road are as follows*- (i) So long as the sections which support HASIR iLKAL are harbouring (tjenax German agents, any effective approach to them other than by force is going to be difficult and if Bade by other means is likely to be interpreted as a sign of weakness. To offer them such responsibility would ^ de facto give them independent recognition and, if &amp;s&amp;usxed would create a situation which is difficult to reconcile with American ideas of controlling Persia by reorganising the Persian Army and gendarmerie.6/ - 5 be accepted accompanied b a deiaand for large supplies of arras and aiowunition fchicii if given might be used against ourselves and would certainly be used against the surrounding countryside* (iv) The qaahqai are not the only interested tribe* the others would have to be included ana the cost in volved would be out of all proportion to the security afforded* Raiding would c jntinue, each tribe putting the bla e on to the other* (v) The tribes would provide no greater security than could be afforded by the Persian Army and Gendarmerfe propperly directed and it ap i ears better to r.mke use of tue existing organisations that to experiment with new ones of uncertain value, especially in view of tne impending A* erican re-orgainsation of these forces* It appears necessary, in fact, to approach the problem from another angle* 9* Suggested treatment of be AGHQA1 anc other tribes* (i) Experience has shown that tribesmen are at their bestwhen they are under a measure of control, when they are justly but iri^rtially treated and when they are made to realise that the slogan of the paramount power is 'Ko nonsense frora anyone - This means you H * (ii) In consequence any improvement in tise security situation must provide for the briiring uncer even partial control of those sections the who are adherents to the cause of kASIR &amp;HA£, ana consequently hostile to both the Persians and ourselves. It is estimated taat the Persian Ar*uy can produce tills resuj t by establishing and main taining a force at FKUKABA2) and eliminating PASIR KHAR, the latter possibly bj negotiation and Hi is is recommended* (ill) It is undesirable that the whole of the t^ASHQ,AI should be stiri'ed up, and to guard against this, the early appointment of a British senior Political Officer with about three assistants for tribal contact is recommended* (ir) After the elimination of A A SIR KiiAP a meeting oi all tue tribal leaders could be convened* it should be made quite clear to them that we insist on their refraining from interference on the road but that we are prepared to employ them on the new road. It is felt that were the Germans eliminated tba/ QASHf^Al might well be induced to accept the responsibility for the maintenance and security of such portion of this new route as passes through QASH 'A I territory. T' e economic aspect of tliis is outlined in Appendix ’B*. (v&gt; H*M Consul at ohIRAZ is of ti\e opinion tiiat the followers of RAhiH KlIAh in the qABH^AI might, in their present frame of mind, oppose the construction of the road from the PlRUZABAh hhhk end, but the Military Attache, TiliRAh is oi the opinion that the ^ASE^AX as a whole would welcome the xo&amp;d and that no opposition would be met with, certainxy not from the AHRAif end. (vi) The selection of the British officers for contsot with the tribes requires careful c nsiden.t ion.The rifefii&amp;e of thoge vfeo haTe beeri tucotiu ence6 are give;) at Appendix &lt; C f . Streer. ie laid on the advantagee lihely to accrue from the attachment of at least one heriic&amp;l Officer to this Mission with a fair supply of medicines. It is felt thgt greater success will be achieved if these officers go with something more tangible ttian empty k^nds and lair woraa. It is recomiuendaa that the equivalent of £ 500 a month in cash and go us bv placed at tue disposal at the senior political officer for occasional distribution. The possibil ity of at least one British officer being ’’bumped off” ia iat nut be lost sight of* and it is for decision what action if any should follow such a regrettable happening. (vii) It would be worth while offering almost any sum for the surrender of the Germans. Hot only the AI are affected according to the reports avail able with C.I.C.I. (viii) Apart from this winding aspect, a Icc&amp;l deterrent against raiding must brbrovidtd. The easiest and most economical method of putting this into operation is b&gt; a small force of •,;/ ship lorries. A detailed outline i. given at Appendix , I&gt; , and the personnel must be British and a small Commando would appear to be the most suitable unit. Conclusions . The salient c xiciuSions from the foregointJare as follows *- (i) The present security situation, though annoying, cannot be described as serious* It is emphasised that i t is capable of serious deteriora tion. (ii) The gravest menace to future security is the Germans who are still at large. (iii) The present situation is entirely due to the inefficiency of Persian administration and the corruptness of their officials. It If still, however, within the compass of the existing Persian Forces provided they are given a, certain auount of transport. (iv) An improvement would undoubtedly be effected by the selection of the right Persian Coftimar der for SHIRAZ and b&gt; the appointmesit of a senior British Political Officer who has access to him. This officer shoula be attached to H.M Consul at SHIRAZ. (v) Less **ouid be gained by attesting to mke the tribes responsible for the sec rity of the road than by increasing the efficiency of the Persian Forces but the middle course advocated in para. 9 should reduce the threat to security from the tribes. Possible courses open to us . There are 5 courses open to us. Course 1 . Is to assui* responsibility for the protection of the road ourselves and to operate convoys under the protect ion of British borces. Thio is open to two serious objectiots; first that7 (S) that it is tying up British f urces p^erfiianentxy which could be raore use fully employed eisev^ere, and second, that it is encouraging the Persian forces to diyest themselves of their responsibility. In consequence it is not recorrmended that we should do so. huoh a course, however, may be forced on us, and this contingency is provided for in the scheme outlined in Appendix ♦E*. Course Is to make the Persian Authorities responsible for the protection of the road on the lines sketched in this report and in Appendix •A* &amp;s modified to meet American requirements. This appears to be the most satisfactory final solution and it is recommenaec liiat it should b. ultimately adopted. .Details o the Persian requ i re metis are given at Appendix •P*. At the present ffiombnt, the Persian forces are not sufficiently trained and equipped nor are their Commanders suificientiy primed to undertake trie task unaided. In consequence an interim eiourse is desirable. Course 3. Is the interim course which should meet present requirements. Details are given in the Plan below. i lan. (1} To use the existing Persian forces* (2) To a F point &amp; selected Persian Commander for BHIRAD. (3) To bring the gendarmerie immediately up to 1,000 strong and to provide 1,000 blankets, 1,000 great coats and 1,000 rations daily. These rations to be a free issue. 'Cheriks* to be either embodied or c iaarmed and uisbandeti. (4) To superimpose onto the existing Persian forces one mobile British unit for patrolling the road. This coula be either a Dir Fteccee Regt or a Berried Ini Bn or a J&amp;otor Bee. ( 6 ) It is preferable taat the unit should be a British one in view oi tne intense dislike of the Indiana by the Persians. This unit could be based on SHIRAZ but its companies would have to operate from widely dispersed centres. Suitable locations are HQ and two coye, SBIRAZ, one coy KAhgRUf, one coy SAADATABAD. The functions of this unit would be to patrol the road at varying hours both by day and night. It is not the intention that it should supply regular tscortsto convoys. If these escort! are at any time licem&amp;u essential they snouiu oe supplied by tie tachi jen ts from the iersian Ar:iy , vho must be provided with transport (initially with drivers} l or this purpose. (One k.T. Coy woulc meet the case.) It is not considered ti^at the present situation demands the use of escorts to convoys. s This unit should not be required to operate a^ay from the immediate vicinity of the road. The following up of bandits across country is the duty of the gendarmerie and /pv the Arny are best qualified. 5 (5) To bring •q* ship lorries, manned by British troops- 8 - into iimnediate operation. A Co.iwando Unit would be most suitable for this task. ( 6 ) To ap oint a British Political Olficer to the stalf of H.M, Consul at SHIRAZ for direct liaison with the Persian authorities in the natter of road security and tribal matters. (7) To appoint id other officers and 2 Medical officers to work under tne above Senior Political officer for direct contact with tne tribes and villagers and gendarmerie• ( 8 ) To provide cash and goods to the val^e of £ 500 monthly for distribution unoer orders of the s.P.O. to e ither tribesmen or^ needy villagers. These goods are not in the nature of &amp; bribe but to facilitate our friendly contact with the tribes. Part of this is to be used as an entertainment allowance. (9) Tne appointment of a British Sub-Area com; anaer is not recommended at this stage, for political reasons but it is desirable that a W/T station should be established at UxiUAZ for dir ct communication with the Arey. This could be part of tne coy. (10) The construction of a low grade road n the align ment SHIRAZ - F IRUZABAD - PARRA SHBABD - BUSH IRE. The tribes should be given 1 &gt;i ediate warning of the proposed confetruction to enable them to participate in the work; otherwise they will migrate. (11) Subject to iminediate survey, the re-alignment of the present road on the suggestions contained in para. 9. Appendix * A* • (la) In view of the strain imposed on M.T. vehicles on the route BUSiURk- HXRAZ; the British forces employed might be more economically maintained from SUl/CAbBAB in spite ol the greater distance involved. (13) The nature of the road South of SHIRAZ would impose undue wear and tear on Armed Cars, Carriers, sr.d their regular employment is not recorumended .

By surprising and causing heavy casualties to would be robbers 9 to make bandits hesitate to hold up any vehicles on this section of road for fear it may prove to be a 9 4 9 Lorry* 2« Ruabtr and Type of Lorries Eight lorries should be obtained* Allowing for maintenance, and camouflage alterations to lorries, this should give an average of six lorries operating at any one time* Every lorry should, as far as possible, be of a different type, and the types should be those now normally operating on this seotlon of the road, both civilian and UKCC. 3* Personnel* (a) Each lorry should be under comd of an officer and approx 9 men including the driver and hie mate* To allow for rest, sickness, and internal administration a force of about 100 men will be required, under a Coy Comd, with officers on a scale of one per lorry (l*e* 9 officers in all}* (b) Capt Fltzroy MACLEAN has been consulted and agrees that the Commando Unit he is at present forming would be very suitable for this task, and that the work would provide excellent training of the type he desires* It is recommended that the operation of the 9 q 9 Lorries be entrusted to Capt FITZROY MACLEAN and his unit* (o) Sufficient skilled personnel should be provided by (HCam) to enable the appearance of lorriee to be frequently altered and to arrange dummy loads* (d) A small £T maintenance staff will be required, sufficient to carry out minor repairs* (e) An interpreter with knowledge of local conditions will be required to accompany each lorry on patrol and assist the officer in charge* His main function will be to ensure that fire ie not opened on innocent persons* Six such men should be earmarked by C*I*C*I* 4* Command * The 9 q 9 Lorry Coy should come under Comd Hq 12 IND DIV who eould delegate responsibility to TEHRAN Sub Area, should this be consider ed preferable* 5* Area of Operations * The v q 9 Coy should be based in or near SHIRAZ and be accommodated in a walled compound or caravanserai to hide it from prying eyes* It will be required to operate on the main road between BUSHIRE -SHIRAZ - ISFAHAN* 6* Armament * (a) Each lorry should carry two Bren guns and three Tommy guns, ths remaining personnel being armed with revolvers and rifles* Viokers 9 K 9 machine guns are Ideal for this purpose and should be obtained in place of Bren guns if possible* A small number of hand grenades will also be required* Tear gas bombs might, on occasions, i rove very effective and it is for decision whether these should be used*Some for© of protection against small arms fire should be provided on lorries in the form of steel plate* In designing the layout of lorries, the necessity for being able to fire almost vertically upwards must be borne in mind* S&lt;iui&gt;'jaent (a) Qaasoufla^e Stores &amp; Certain camouflage stores will be required, e*g* sacks, bales and boxes to represent loads of lootable material* Paint and other materials will also be required to enable the appearance of individual lorries to be altered from time to time • Tentage* Sufficient tentage to accommodate all personnel will be required* Cooking Stores * Sach lorry must be self contained in cooking stores, in addition to the requirements of the base camp* (d) Clothing , A selection of suitable civilian clothing will have to be obtained to enable the crows of lorries to be disguised as local villagers, road workers, UKCC lorry drivers etc* Agreement of the lerslan Government should be obtained for a proportion of these crews to wear Persian Gendarmerie uniform* This is specially desirable since the presence of a gendarme aboard a vehicle has, in the past, proved an in centive to interference by bandits* (e) Water Containers * These must be provided on a scale sufficient to make each lorry self contained in drinking and cooking water for the period of its patrol* 8* tealntenance * (a) Kations The presence of British troops camped in the SHIKA2 area will almost certainly give rise to politically undesirable rumours that they are buying up all the local supplies and causing a scarcity for the civilian population* To avoid this it is essential that the troops concerned ehould be forbidden to buy food (other than fruit and fresh meat) locally and that all their ration requirements ehould be sent by periodical K*T* convoys from SULTA&amp;ABAD and/or another suitable supply centre on which place they should depend, for their general maintenance* (b) 101 Sufficient 101 can be obtained from the A*I*0*C. pumps in SHIRAN and in the main towns on the route. Any special requirements to come from SULTA3SABAD and/or another suitable supply centre# (c) Water * Water presents no problem, but from the medical point of view it ie preferable that lorries on patrol should go out self contained in pure drinking and cooking water rather than rely on doubt ful local sources#J - 3 - (d) MT Maintenance * To bo oarrlod out 'by a small 1£T »alnt«nanoe staff, •uppliod with tho neceasary tools, squipiBtnt and spars parts* So©e assistance oan bs obtained if neoessary from local blacksmiths* (a) Oaroouflajgs * The appearance of lorries will frequently ha^re to be changed* This will inrolTe special repainting, minor alterations to body and changes of load. This should' be carried out by personnel supplied by 0(0am ), and with materials obtained either locally or from military resources* 9* Training * To ensure good results, a short period of training before operations begin is essential. A battle drill will have to be worked out and practised* It is recommended that the personnel who are to form the 9 &lt;4 f (Joy be collected as soon as possible and that training be started with military 3-ton lorries while the proper lorries and equipment are being obtained* This training should be done somewhere away from the ultimate area of operations so as to achieve surprise when patrolling begins in earnest* Training should be preceded by a reconnaissance of the road ISFAHAN - SHIRAZ - BUSHIEB by the officers selected for the 'q* Ooy• It Is suggested that lorries should normally work In pairs* either free running or else as 'stragglers* or 'breakdowns' from a formed convoy. The main object will be to present a tempting subject for apparently easy loot to would be robbers* 10* Security * The success of the 9 q' lorries will depend almost entirely on surprise* Svery postible precaution will therefore have to be taken to ensure that bandits do not get information as to the appearance, routes and timings of lorries on patrol* It must be remembered that nevvs travels fast and that none of the local population can be regarded as reliable from a security point of view* IX. 0*0* ’q 9 Ooy should keep in close touch with the British Consul in SHIRAZ who will be able to assist in matters of local administration* He should also avail himself to the fullest extent of the help and in formation on local conditions that the Consul in SHIRAZ, the Political Resident in SOBlfXRX and the Consul in ISFAHAN are in a position to give him* 12* As time is short it is recommended that the above proposals, if agreed, should be put into effect, and the neocssary personnel and equipment provided, with the minimum delay.HP S to REPORT ON SnflKwna smzmro? mmikit - 'TOfMX'g 1 * tCTxsar: THE METHOD wi^owr- ^XAN RRGCMMSND^ri fOR jeROTSCTION OF AIIVTO-ROSSIA THMICU B SHOITID —r^rwisuTTrar y^&gt;Rgg; TOkadi angi^gjgrr^ 1 . General• The plan outlined below is based on the employment of Three Kotor Bns or lorried Inf Bne controlled and adminietered by a Sub Area Gororaander and email staff with H* at SHIRA7., It is only designed to come into operation should the security situation deteriorate to such an extent the British Forces haye to be employed in addition to the protection already being provided by the lereian Army and Gendarmerie* In the worst case, should we have to take over completely txom the Persian Army and Gendarmerie the equivalent of two additional Garrison Bns would be required. The scheme covers only the section of the road BCRa^JAN - SHIRAZ - ABADEH, since only in this area is any serious threat thought likely to arise. 2. Ob j ec t • The abject will be to give a maximum security to Aid to Russia vehicles either free running or in convoy, by day and by night. 3* Unit Loc atio ns and Division of Responsibility (a) Unit locations will be as follows:-(see also iumexure t A* to x ; this Api&gt;endlx). bub Area Hq f A l Bn Less two Qoya ONE Coy One Goy 'B* Bn less two Coys.

(a) A mobile reserve of at least one Goy will be kept al^y v a available at both KAZSIiUN and SHIRAZ and the maximum possible mobile reserve kept by the Bn at SAADATABAD which has three detached coropaniee. as frequently ae the vehicle situation permits each Bn and detached Coy will send out patrols of not leas than two vehicles to cover its own road seetdr at irregular intervals by day or night. id) From Annexure , A I to this Appendix it will be seen that Bn and Coy locations have been chosen to be close together in the more difficult and insecure parts of the road and fur ther e apart where the going is easier and security likely to be better. No Goy has been given responsibility for more than two principal passes as this would involve excessive mechanised wear and tear.(S^l • 2 • 4 * Seacrte and Patrol Byatero * (a^ A ayeten of convoy •ecorta combined with free lance patrols will be aaployed, and each Bn will be made responsible for the security of vehicles on a given sector of the road as ahown in lara 3 above# This Sector will be eub-divided into sasaller sectors of Coy responsibility# (b) Allowing for rest and vehicle maintenance, only sufficient troops will be available for two escorts of one platoon each to be provided daily# Therefore the system of running should, if possible, consist of not more than two large upgoing convoys daily • the remain der of vehicles being free running and unescorted# (c) Sach upgoing convoy will run unescorted from BUSHIKS as far as B0RA2JAI? where it will receive an escort of one platoon (3 lorries) from the Coy at BCEAX3TAK# At KTJNAd TAKHTIH the convoy will be handed over to an escort from the Coy there, and so on throughout the journey until ABAD 8 H is reached# Worth of Abadeh convoy« will be unescorted# (d) Keturwing convoys will be similarly escorted, picking up their first escort at ABADdH« It is assumed that returning convoys will be fewer in number than upgoing convoys# The escorts so made surplus at trie uppc- end of each sector will therefore be able to return to v their parent units as free lance patrols. 5 , Armament and Squipment # (a) Armament # k The most suitable weapons for escorts and patrols will be racs, Brens, rifles and hand grenades# borne redis tribution of weapons in a Kotor Bn (should one be used) will therefore be neceaaary to allow the anti-tank and machine gun companies to take their part# (b) Squipment # Kormsl military B*?• (30 cwt or 3 ton lorries) would be suitable but some armoured protection againet small arms fire ie very desirable, especially for the driver# If 0KCC could be persuaded to provide a nwober of Dodge or Studebaker lorries as used in their convoys, we would obtain the double advantage of concealing the identity of part of the escort and providing a propor tion of vehicles with strong winches which are invaluable for accidents and. for clearing falls of rock in ths passes# It is cotisidereci that armoured cars would be unsuitable for patrol or escort work in this ty^ e of terrain and their use wasteful of armoured car resources. Never theless their display value is such that a few could be usefully employed for ’•showing the flag** 6 • Interoo m municatlon . Three channels of intercommunication are possible but all present certain difficulties# (a) W/T, which is unreliable in such mountainous country• lb) Line. The ideal would be to connect up all units and Sub Area by military line# This would involve a large call on our already limited stocks of signal cable. your civilian lines follow the route, how ever, and it is understood that it is technically possible to use one of the^e lines# A Signal recce is present in progress to see toto what extent the existing lines between TBHRAH - - BUSHIK 8 can be used* (c) I&gt;»H» A truck or lorry could be used to carry a T)H but this icethod is slow, and in time of insecurity unsafe. Kotor cycles are ruled out as being too dangerous on the passes and very wulnerable to interference* 7• ¥aintenance * Maintenance of the Road Guard Torce can be carried out either from BTJSBIivS* which inTolves isueh wear and tear to vehicles and tyre* over i70 milee* to SHIRA&amp;, including the ascent of the six large passes, or else via &amp;TJLTASJABAP or %W a distance of ovtfr 450 miles. It might be more economical in the long run, and interfere less fcith Aid to Russia traffic, if maintenance were done from SGLMTAHAD or *iai. There is at least erne A.l.C.C. petrol pump in each Bn road sector, and water is available in each unit location, therefore maintenance requirements will be confined mainly to rations, itT spareii and ammunition. iatrol tank and water tank lorries will be required for Bne and detached coys, each of which will also have to be self contain ed for vehicle maintenance and light repairs. 3pa-t‘e tyres, clutches, brakes and springs are likely to be tho items most in demands 8 , Oo-^peration with *** horries The f &lt;4 f lorry Goy (see Appx *T)*) will be independent of the Road Guard; Bns and will come directly under the Bub Area ?om ander. Bn Ccmmandt/e will however work in close co-operation with the lorry Coy and assist it in its operations whenever required. 9 . &amp;orst Case, should Persian Army and GeMa rmerie o ease_to fune.tljgS on the project ed^r ouTe . Should the security situation become so bad ah to make it necessary for British forces completely to take over the protection of this stretch of road from the lersian Army and Gendarmerie the following additional troops will be required t- (a) 1.0CG wen to guard four out of the six main passes i.e. KAltt, HtXDAK, TTT KHAK and HR ZAM. This could be suitably done by a Garrison Bn having a Company on each pass. lb) 1,000 men to man the existing gendarmerie posts on the route. One Garrison Bn would be suitable for this.4. At the «arlieet date and in contemplation of affective operation of this &gt;lan, it ia necessary that the proper training of IRANIAN personnel be accomplished, hence on each truck, the driver should be British, the assistant driver Iranian; at each radio station and on each mobile radio set the operator should be British and the assistant operator Iranian. Personnel for patrols should be one half British and one half Iranian. The number of eventual Iranian personnel will be 1620 men. To start this operation and for the training of the Iranian force one half of this number would be adequate (810 men). The total numoer of 1620 is to insure complete 24 hour service. The number of Iranians on existing fixed posts (Gendarme) ie 600. (*) It would therefore be necessary as previously discussed, to supply these men with the necessary adequate clothing and fo &gt;d to insure complete and effective performance of duty. It is estimated there will be needed a total of 2200 overcoats, 2200 blankets, 2200 pairs of shoes and 2200 rations per day; initial issue to be 1410 ; subsequent issue 810. The accompli ohmsnt of the mission depends upon three factors, namely; the supply of equipment, the selection of the Iranians, the extent and nature of the instruction. Speed is of the essence.
