With reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram No. 1379, dated the 17th February 1913,1 have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a report by Mr. E. H. Pascoe, Assistant Superintendent in this Department, on the prospects of obtaining potuble water by artesian boring at Koweit on the Persian Gulf. Prospects of obtaining potable water by artesian boring at Koweit on the Persian Gulf. I arrived on the 20th February, 1913, and spent a fortnight in and around ^ j, w Koweif, endeavouring to form an opi ate an oca i y. n ^ oli ag ^ ^ an( j a g e ^ country-rock below the sand, and the likelihood of its capability, of retaining water fit for drinking purposes. ' Koweit lies on the coast of the Arabian Desert, in a small arm of the Persian Gulf at its north-western extremity. The desert stretches inland for at least 200 miles, without a hill-range and probably without an exposure of rock. There are no exposures at Kowext, and ^ _ the only hard rock found is the ' 4 Litoral Rocks at Koweit. Eag or „ Concrete ,&gt; mentioned by Dr Pilgrim as common in the Gulf. Below the surface, at various inconstant hori zons, pebbles and sand are occasionally cemented together into calcareous or gypseous bands sufficiently coherent to influence the under ground flow of surface water. Around Koweit an efflorescent salt, similar to that found in Burma near exposures of Pegu beds and to' the 4 4 Reh ' s of India, is common on the surface, especially in damp places. A foot or so below the surface a band of gypsi- ferous sand, some 9 inches to 1J feet thick, is very commpnly found, the gypsum is derived from subjacent Tertiary beds. With the aid of surface fires this material is partially dehydrated, and the product known as ' jus ', containing a certain amount of ' plaster of Paris ' and perhaps a little lime, is used as a cement for building purposes. This small industry covers quite a large area. Most of the water obtained from surface wells (from 10 to 20 feet deep) is slightly brackish. By the kindness of Captain Shakespear, Political Agent at Koweit, I was able to visit for a couple of days a low hill known as Wara and some small knolls, and rising (ground, known as Burqan, 24 miles south of Koweit These, fortunate- ly, are of Tertiary rock, though of very Wara and Burqa . limited extent only. Wara is a small truncated cone, some 20 to 25 yards across its fiat top, and. projecting 50 or 60 feet above the desert plain. It is capped by a conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone about 4—5 feet thick ; the pebbles of the conglomerate are small and consist mostly of quartz. It lies practically horizontally, dipping in one place at 8—10° towards north-west. A glimpse of the underlying beds is obtained on one side of the hill; they appear to be identical with those seen at Burqan. The conglomerate has every appearance of a Bakhtiari bd, and for reasons to follow .it probably represents the base of this series. Burqan consists of a series of lowridge-like knolls grouped along or parallel to the perimeter of a broad ellipse, which represents in all probability a low flat dome with its longer axis running approximately from north to south. The monotony of the flat plain occupying the centre is relieved by a few additional knolls. Conglomerate or conglomeratic sandstone, exactly similar to those at Wara, caps all these knolls and ridges, and in all cases has scarcely appreciable dip. There is much sagging at the edges and a great deal of scree, but here and there it is possible to observe what lies beneath it. Below it in the easternmost ridges, I found bands of ochreous sandstone, sandy clays of variegated colours—red, pink, yellow, etc., a white kaolin-bearing sand stone, and many large fragments of selenite or crystalline gypsum. Flakes of gypsum occur in other parts of the hills and the efflorescent salt in the central plain. All this points to the exposure, or immediate proximity beneath the surface, of Dr. Pilgrim's Fars series. I am inclined to think the Fars beds are actually exposed, the caps of conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone represen ting the basal bed of the Bakhtiari series. The Fars exposure would be about a mile long by | mile broad. Between Koweit and Wara the desert is pebbly all the way, except in a few bare grass-less patches covered with, efflorescent salt. Small shrubs also increase in number towards Wara and Burqan, Between Koweit and Wara. where they are quite plentiful; this may be a result 1 of the rise of the mote or less impervious Bakhtiari conglomerate to wards the surface. . Kubbar and Q^arain Islands wire disappopting. The latter is about 4 miles west of Koweit, and contains no rock except the recent literal ragstone. The same stone was found all round the beach of / Kubbar and Qaram islands. Kubbar, which is 35 miles south-east of Koweit. Fou!r and-a-half miles east-south-east of this island, a smooth patch of fresh water was observed in the sea and reported by the Commander of H. M. S. ' Lapwing'. A copy of this report, kindly supplied by Captain Shakespear, is appended. 1 The geo-tectonic features appear to run, in a general way, somewhere between N.-S. and N.-W. — S.-E. This is borne out by (i) the orientation of the Burqan dome and ^he Relative position of Wara Hill (a little west of ^ . north from Burqan), (ii) by the general ruc ure : . ul strike and trend of the Persian Gulf and Euphrates and Tigris valleys, (%) by the direction of the low flat swell-ridges observed and mapped by Captain Shakespear further inland. The eastern slope of these flat swells is considerably more gradual than the western, a cir cumstance conformable with the chart of the Gulf, which shows a very gentle eastwards shelving along the Arabian side, but a comparatively steep drop into deep water along the Persian coast. From this we may deduce that easterly dipping beds cover a greater proportion of the total area than do westerly dipping beds. The dome at Burqan is a very gentle one. This fact and general consi derations are conformable to the view that the subjacent Tertiary strata in and around Koweit have been very little disturbed by folding movements. After these preUminanes it is possible to consider the question of finding water at Koweit hy artesian boring.

Cr0p ' Ss 1 v u !:l.f* p '' iono 'The Fars series is a porous one, and if it can, be reached, water ought to be found at some horizon or other, although it is not, I believe, been plentifully met within the oil borings near Ahwaz. The most serious consideration, however, is whether any of it would be fresh enough for drinking purposes. A great part of Arabia and Persia are more or less permeated with rock-salt, gypsum and ' reh''; in fact, the water of the upper part of the Persian Gulf is said to be actually salter than that of the ocean (Gulf Pilot Capt. G. G. Constable and Lieutenant A. W. Stifle). In the Burma Pegu series, which corresponds very closely to the Fars in age and character, fresh water has occasionally been found, though most of it is brackish; it is not unlikely that some water-bearing bed in the Fars may also be found free from rock-salt and gypsum. It may not be necessary, however, to penetrate into the Fars beds. In fact, there seems to me better chances of obtaining potable water from the superjacent Bakhtiari sandstones if these exist belew Koweit, and better chances still from the lowest horizons of the desert sand. One of the Bakhtiari conglomerates would be capable of holding up large quantities of water; a few miles south of Burqan water is so held up in considerable quantity and of good quality. _ It will be seen that the evidence to go upon is meagre in the extreme, and in ordinary circumstances, one would be very loath to advise such an expensive opera tion as boring on such scanty data. But oring ' in view of the extreme scarcity of water and the crying necessity of the people here, who, out of the pearling season, number some 40,000, and also in face of the fact that no artesian experiments have ever been made along this coast, I have no hesitation in strongly recommending trial borings at Koweit. The great element of uncertainty seems to me well worth ignoring on account of the great importance of the object. One of the most hopeful signs is the reported occurrence of fresh water off Kubbar Island mentioned above. Cap tain Shakespear and I were unable to find this, but there is a well-known example of this at Bahrein, and the 'Lapwings' testimony is quite definite enough. I do not think this water can have come from the Shatt-el-Arab ; in the first place, fresh water being less dense than salt, there would be a connecting strip of fresh water between Kubbar and the Shatt-el-|rab, and, in the second place, the distance seems too great. It is far more likely that there is a submarine spring. As drilling would be undertaken more or less blindly, no local spot, as far as is known, would be preferable to any other; I should select one unlikely to be contaminated with foul surface water, convenient for the inhabitants, and removed as far as possible from the ' 'jus'' areas. The best method of drilling would be the American cable system, and the most suitable engine to work with would be an internal combustion oil-engine, since there would bej great difficulty in obtaining fresh water for a steam boiler. A suggestion made by Mr. C. F. Shaw of Messrs. Shaw and Haynes (Basrah), who has had experinece with water-wells in America, seems to me a sound one, namely, to procure at first a high-power engine capable of drilling to deep horizons (3,000 feet or more), and pipe apparatus suitable for the exploration of depths up to about 700-800 feet. If no sucoess were met with, larger pipe and tools could be sent for and the same engine used for deeper boring. Salt water would, of course, have to be shut off by driving the pipe into clay or against a hard bed and perhaps the addition of hydraulic cement; this is a delicate operation and requires experienced supervision. As each water sand encountered should, whenever feasible, be tested as to its freshness, a good deal of under-reaming will probably^be entailed and progress consequently slow. The whole apparatus could subsequently be used for similar experiments in Bushire, Masqat and elsewhere; Dr. Pilgrim was inclined to think deep wells in Masqat would meet with water in quantity.* There seems to be much irregularity in the distribution of salt, so that the greater the number of test-wells the better. Dr. Pilgrim remarks that in Bahrein Island, of two wells sunk within a few yards of each other, the one may be brackish and the other sweet, * * Note on a site for a proposed quarantine station in the Persian Gulf, etc..

He did not stop to sound, but fixed position of breakers whilst steaming along his course. 2.

The following remarks are submitted for consideration :—'' Lapwing has frequently been in the vicinity of Kubba Island, and it was observed on each occasion there was a very Considerable tide causing tide-rips in various directions according to the hours of the tide. On one occasion a suspicious-looking patch of smooth water was observed close to the position now reported. Boats were lowered and it was sounded out, and soundings were found to agree with chart, but the water was nearly fresh. The Sheikh of Kuwait informed me that this was not caused by an under-water spring, but was fresh water that had come down from the Shatt-al-Arab. 4. In conclusion, I cannot understand how we failed to see the heavy breakers reported, as ' Lapwing ' has visited Kubba Island in all sorts of weather, G. M.

In continuation of my letter No. 2047, dated the 3rd April 1913, I have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a report by Mr. E. H. Pascoe, Assistant Superintendent in this Department, upon the prospects of obtaining oil near Kuwait, Persian Gulf. Prospects of obtaining oil near Kuwait, Persian Gulf, Introduction. Some 24 miles south of Kuwait, a small area of Tertiary rocks projects above the surface of the Desert, and is known as Burqan. I examined it between the dates 2nd to 5th March, 1913. Burqan is close to the rock known as Wara, and consists of some small Eocka&lt; knolls and rising ground. The knolls are ridge-like and are grouped along or parallel to the permiter of a broad ellipse, ^hich represents in all probability a low flat dome with its longer axis running approximately from north to south. The monotony of the flat plain occupying the centre is relieved by a few additional knolls. Oomglomerate or conglomeratic sandstone, exactly similar to those at Wara, caps all these knolls and ridges, and in all cases has a scarcely appreciable dip. There is much sagging at its edges and a great deal of scree, but here and there it is possible to observe what lies beneath it. Below it, in the easternmost ridges, I found bands of ochreous sandstone, sandy clays of variegated colours—red, pink, yellow, etc., a white kaolin-bearing sandstone, and many large fragments of selenite or crystalline gypsum. Makes of gypsum occur in other parts of the hills, and the efflorescent salt in the central plain. All this points to the exposure, or immediate proximity beneatli the surface of Dr. Pilgrim's 'Pars ' series, I am inclined to think the Pars beds are actually exposed, the caps of conglomerate and conglomeratic sandstone representing the basal bed of the Bakhtiari series. The Pars exposure would be about a mile long by f mile broad. The geotectonic features appear to run, in a general way, somewhere between north, south and north-west-south-east. This is borne out {i) by the structaret orientation of the Burqan dome and the relative position of Wara Hill (a little west of north from Burqan), {ii) by the general strike and trend of outcrops in Persia and further south in Arabia, (m) by the trend of the Persian Grulf and Euphrates and Tigris Valleys, (tv) by the direction of the low flat swell-ridges observed and mapped by Captain Shakespear further inland. The eastern slope of these flat swells is considerably more gradual than the western, a circumstance conformable with the chart of the Gulf which shows a very- gentle eastward shelving along the Arabian side but a comparatively steep drop into deep water along the Persian coast. Prom this we may deduce thafc easterly-dipping beds cover a greater proportion of the total area than do westerly-dipping beds. The dome at Burqan is a very gentle one. A little bituminous earth is found in the central plain. The prospects of obtaining an oil supply depend Oil principally upon (0 0iI the age and the capacity for storage of the rocks, (ii) structure, (Hi) position with regard to the oil ' belt,' , The age of the beds is favourable, if it is correct to assume they belong to the Pars, since this is the oil-bearing series in Persia. There is no reason to believe the nature of the beds beneath Burqan should be different from that of the Pars in Persia, and they may be looked upon therefore as sufficiently porous to retain oil in workable quantities. The structure, if correctly diagnosed, is also favourable, a gentle dome in fact being an excellent clofdtype of folding suitable for an oil-field. As to its geographical position, this locality is not on the line of strike of the rich oil deposits now being worked above Ahwaz, and is, in fact, over 170 miles to the south-west of this line. This does not necessarily mean that oil in commercial quantity does not occur below Burqan, but it adds a decidedly speculative element to any operations. A ' floating tract of naphtha,' coincidiDg no doubt with a submarine seepage was described by Captain Constable as occurring between the islands of Qaru and Kubbar, some 56 miles south-east of Burqan. On the whole, my opinion is that the chances are not unfavourable, and that an oil company would not require much inducement to test it, if protection and permanency of concession were guaranteed. The central plain of Burqan would be the best site for tests, and these should be as deep as possible, as the uppermost layers of the Ears are probably all that are exposed. Under present conditions there would be great difficulty in obtaining water for the boiler ; possibly an internal combustion engine would have to be employed. C13FD—^4—22-5-13—GCBP Simla@ TELEGRAM.P.

Grey has taken note of the assurances contained in your communication to the effect that the interests of the Syrian Exploration Company (Limited) are predominantly, and the controlling interests entirely, British, that the concession when obtained, and any concession that may subsequently be granted by the Ottoman Government, will be worked entirely as independent British undertakings, and that no concessions will be transferred without the consent of His Majesty's Government. I am also to inform you that a memorandum has now been handed to Hakki Pasha, requesting his Highness to urge upon the Turkish Government the advisability of giving a wider interpretation to the stipulations of the mining law, as far as prospecting operations for petroleum are concerned ; and urging that, in the case of the Syrian Exploration Company, a further two years' extension of time, dating from the day of the expiry of the licences, may be afforded, for conducting boring operations in all the properties now registered in the joint names of yourself and Suleiman Bey Nassif. The memorandum added that Sir E. Grey confidently relies upon the Ottoman Government undertaking to confirm your company in the possession of any of the properties concerned which you may ultimately elect to develop. 1 am, &amp;c.

[December 3.j CONFIDENTIAL. Section 6. i 54852] No. I. Sir Edward Grey to Sir R. Eodd. (No. :m.) gi rj Foreign Office, December 3, 1913. THE Italian Ambassador asked me to-day about a report in the ' Daily Telegraph' that the British negotiations with Turkey had obtained, or would obtain, a monopoly of oil in Syria and a large district of Asia Minor ; the regulation of the navigation from the Persian Gulf by a concession to a company of which 50 per cent, of the shares should be British, 25 per cent. German, and 25 per cent. French, and conditions that would secure the practical independence of the Sheikh of Koweit under Turkish suzerainty. I said that I had not seen this report in the ' Daily Telegraph,' but, according to my recollection, oil concessions formed no part of the negotiations that we were carrying on with Turkey in connection with the increase of the customs dues. I did not recollect that we had made oil concessions any condition of our consent to such an increase. The Persian Gulf, the navigation, and the end of the Bagdad Railway did form the subject-matter of such negotiations; but, from what he told me, the ' Daily Telegraph' did not seem to be accurately informed as to the details. The Ambassador said that I had informed him some time ago that these matters, connected with the Persian Gulf, &amp;c., were the subject of the negotiations with Turkey about the increase of customs dues, and he concluded from what I had said that he might inform his Government that the statement in the a Daily Telegraph ' was not authentic. I said that I could judge of the statement in the ' Daily Telegraph ' only from what he told me of it; but, judging from that, he might certainly say what he proposed. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY.

My dear Builard , Many thanks for your D /o letter of the 27tb June with its enquiry about oil seepages • It appears alsiost identical with one recently received by Keyes at Bahrain • I told hin to reply , as you think of doing , to the Board of trade and suggested that he should say that the places named did not lie within his jurisdiction and that appli cation had better be Hade to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf 9 Bushire • One special reason for our reticence was that we thought the enquiry cane frosi Pearson and we were not at all sure that H.M.G. would be in a hurry to give him any information . As a matter of fact , Banaid ul Gar and Garu belong to Kuwait ; Halul is indeterminate but probably belongs to Abu Dhabi of the Trucial Oheifa^ Tarsi io probably Parsi , also indeterminate but perhaps an appanage of El Hasa . But I think perhaps Keyes• reply is the best suited to the case • About Bin Sa'ud , I am sending you on all information we get in ordinary confidential office routine | Koyes sent us some quite interesting information the other day which will be passed on to you with the rest ; it seems probable which 9 Ithink , is the best one can say for any news on this subject ./ 1 should not, when consulted, concur without full enquiry and knowledge both of the prospects of the enterprise ■ and the terms proposed. The present moment, with the Anglo Turkish Convention as yet unpublished and this international upheaval in prospect is not one at which we want to start any new questions or Enterprises, which can be postponed without inconvenience. Subject to any observations you may wish to make, I think the best plan in the present case would be firstly for Political Agent, Koweit, to refer, in conversation with the Shaikh / to the instrument of 1399, and say that we hope he will apply, the same principle to British subjects and give no concessions without taking our .advice. Having got his assurance on this point you might then tell Leo Malcolm that the Shaikh would give no concession without consulting usf^that the juncture is inopportune,for the reasons above givengiven for raising the question at present. I see no objection to your adding as a piece of friendly personal advice, that if he addressed you a line saying that he would like to interest himself in the direction referred tO| that he realised the juncture for broaching the subject with the Shaikh was not considered convenient but that he would be grateful if, when Government could conveniently give the Shaikh advice in the matter, his interests and his application might ' receive favourable consideration.

This is no doubt the deposit which iiessra Jaaes and Hclse went oat to find behind Bas Kathima, and from the reDorts of the guide who went with them I imagine that they must have rmss&amp;i very close to the srjot. As this guide declared he was sure of finding the oalc place, if given another apportunit_y, I set out with Shaikh AbdullaJ: bin Salim, eldest sore of the Shaikh of Kuwait ana marching via Jahara, reached . daira on March 18th, Noxt^we started in the direction of Sabiyah, but with the intention cf oraaping at Maghaira if unsuccessful, and trying back next day. Hov;e-ver, we found the deposit though with considerable difficulty owing to the uniform snd featureless appearance of the wilderness. The guide first brought us to a sujrsfrir outcrop frors which I took sarsplos (red label). We erected a cairn on the site, tie were then overtaken by a duststona and the hunt began under difficult conditions for the second outcrop, which the guide described as black and oily. This we found, bj accident. The outcrop occurea in two places in a long sweep of sand without any bushes on it, which lookoi as if it taight hnve been at soiao time or another a water course. There was plenty of the stuff. We took smaples (blue label) and erected a cairn. Owing to the weather conditions it was not possible to fix the spot exactly, but the accompanying sketch will show it apr*roximatolj# Shaikh Abdullah bin Balim, eldest son of the Shaikh of Kuwait, accompained mo aim with him wore a numerous retinue. There should therefore ae no difficulty in providingo providing your geologists with guides if the ssmples sent here- with t&gt;ro7e satisfactory, I could make all necessary arrangements for them ana would be glad to accompany them personally# Mean while I send you samples of the sulphur and bitumen with a sketch map showing the approximatci position of the deposit^ Yours faithfully Sd» R» E« A* Hamilton, Lieutenant Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait.Copy of a d/o letter No.1747 dated Calcutta 28/7/1917 . from tha Dxreotor Oeological Survey of India to Kassrs.Strick Soott ^ Co», Basra, A suggestion has been wade that it might be worth while to sink a boring in the neighbourhood of Koweit to test the petroliferous beds.
