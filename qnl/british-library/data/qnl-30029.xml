Please refer to your letter 11/21/48 of the 11th December last about Wooas-Ballard's contract. 7 We have now heard from Woods-Ballard that he accepts the amendments proposed by the Sultan. (SGD) A.C. STEWART.Copy of semi-official letter No, (11/21/48) of the 11th December, 1948, from Sir Rupert Hay to A.C. Stewart, Esq., Foreign Office, London. Please refer to correspondence ending with your letter E 13991/74/91 of November 12th. 2. I forwara herewith a draft of Woods-Ballard's contract, as amended by the Sultan. I am afraid the latter must be’ accused of cheeseparing to some extent, but he wants to depart as little as possible from Byard’s contract which he also has taken as a model. The main points which call for comment are as follows:- article 4 - The Sultan agrees to pay Vvoods-Ballard' s passage by air when he comes out on completing his arabic studies, but insists that apart from this payment should be made for passages by sea at the commencement and termination of the contract on the same lines as Byaru's contract. A first class passage Irom London to Muscat via Bombay by sea costs from IL. 1284 to Es. 1818 anu a passage from London by air to Bahrain and thence by sea to Muscat costs k.1478-5-0, so that there is no appreciable financial difference. If, however, Vvoods-Ballard insists on provision being made for air passages via Bahrain, please let me know accordingly so that I may inform the Sultan, possibly the simplest course would be to leave matters as they are lor the present and let Vvoous-Ballard argue the point with the Sultan when he comes out. tide ip - The Sultan wanted to cut this out altogether da it is not included in Byard’s contract, and he has only agreed to its inclusion provided it is not treated as a precedent and provided a maximum sum is fixed. article 7 - The Sultan wanted to cut out 'and one deck passage' in the last sentence but two, but I succeeded in persuading him to retain it provided again, it is not treated as a precedent. Article 8 - The Sultan has amplified this to make it correspond with the corresponding article in Byard's contract. I can see no objection to the alteration made. (SGD) W.R. HAY.the day • • • • 1948 DRAFT.
