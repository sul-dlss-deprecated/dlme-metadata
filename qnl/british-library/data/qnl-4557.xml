It is doubtful whether there is any 'External' work in India into which Fowle would fit (he does not know Afghanistan or the North West Frontier), but we think it worth considering at the present juncture whether a man of his energy and powers of expression could not be placed in organisations, whether for intelligence or propaganda, dealing with the Middle East. One qualification should we think be made, and this is that it would be unwise to employ him on work tfiich brought him too near the pitch on ^which he has just been playing, or into danger of collision with the political or administrative arrangements in the Persian Gulf. But such a qualification need not perhaps debar Fowle from specialised work in England, or perhaps at Cairo, connected with Arab countries as a whole, including the states in the Persian Gulf, or with Persia.

Perhaps I should not have troubled you with a question about Cornwallis; but your letter is certainly a help to us and I am grateful for the trouble you have taken. I entirely agree that publicity in the Middle East is going to be of great importance and we shall be glad to have on record the name of anybody with first rate qualifications and experience in case an opportunity should arise for employing him. Even if we find that we do not need Fowle at this stage it seems highly probable that we shall be able to employ him in a crisis.

Fowle as a man who might be of use to us in the Ministry of Information. There is no doubt that we shall have to conoern ourselves with the question of planning British publicity in the Middle Mast; and we are in fact already taking steps to do so. The man we have in mind at the moment is Sir Kinahan Cornwallis^who was Public Adviser of Finance to the i Iraq Government some years ago. I understand that he has the necessary experience to advise us on questions of publicity in Iran and Afghanistan. I do not, however, know either him or '''Fowle personally; and I should be glad to learn how you would compare the two for our purposes. If you think that Cornwallis could stand on his own merits I would propose to make use of him in the next few weeks, since we are anxious to get on with our work as quickly as possible, reserving the question whether he or Powle would be of most use to us if nothing untoward happens before Fowle becomes available.

Under one form of the oro.oosal nov/ under consideration for an Intelligence Bureau for the Middle East at Cairo there would have Been a political section, 'but it is not proposed to proceed with this form of the scheme for the present. If it should 'be revived later on Sir T. Fowle might conceivably be worth considering ns a possible head for such political section. 2. Another and perhaps more likely possibility is his employment in connection with British publicity in the Middle ast. You have probably noticed that our representatives at Damascus and Cairo have recently suggested steps with a view to setting up a co-ordinating propaganda centre for the Arab world in Palestine or Egypt. If anything comes of this idea (which seems prima facie a good one) we might suggest Sir T. Fowle’s name for consideration. As he says, he is interested in the subject (he was one of the earliest and strongest advocates of the B.B.C. Arabic broadcasts) and his experience might fit/2. fit him for running such a Bureau. 3. When and if a Ministry of Information is set up, it ought surely to devote a go )d deal of attention to publicity the Middle Eastland, if so,Sir T. Eowle might perhaps find work in that Department. I do not think that there would be room for Sir T. ^owle in the B.B.C. organisation for Arabic broadcasts itself. They are now running their own show in liaison with the Foreign Office. There is not likely to be any suitable administrative vacancy and Sir T. Fowle is not himself a language expert. The League of Nations which he also mentions seems / ' to be outside his line of country. A draft letter to Sir T. Fowle is suggested. Possibly also you would think it worth v/hile to write to Sir A.
