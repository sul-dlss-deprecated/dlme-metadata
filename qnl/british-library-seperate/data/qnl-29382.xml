It shows the eastern half of the Arabian Peninsula, dominated by the ‘Ruba-Al-Khali’ [Rub’ al Khali, or Empty Quarter], and indicates numerous boundary lines: the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish convention of 1913; the violet line of the Anglo-Turkish convention of 1914; the Aden boundary as delimited in 1903-1905 and confirmed in the convention of 1914; Ibn Saud’s ‘Ojair Line’ (1922); the approximate frontier claimed by Ibn Saud in April 1935; the boundaries offered to Ibn Saud in April and June 1935; the boundary of the area contemplated in June 1935 as a further concession but never offered to Ibn Saud; the frontier offered by Sir Andrew Ryan to Ibn Saud in November 1935 (the ‘Riyadh Line’); the approximate limits of the ‘dira’ of the Mura tribe who owe allegiance to Ibn Saud, 1935; the boundary of the additional area which the Aden Government was willing to concede in Spring 1937; the adjustment to the ‘Riyadh Line’ made in February 1937; limits beyond which the Sultan of Muscat makes no claims, May 1937.The frontiers key and the coloured frontier lines on the map are marked in pencil with capital letters (A through to M), presumably in anticipation of the map being reproduced in black and white, and in order to preserve its readability.</abstract><typeOfResource>cartographic</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Map</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100028545818.0x000001#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
