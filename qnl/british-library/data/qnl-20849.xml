General Budget, 13644 GENERAL REVIEW. The revenue for the year 1363 was over 55 lakhs and was the highest so far achieved in the history of the State, the expenditure was proportionally high and amounted to over 33 lakhs. Approximately 14 lakhs was added to the Reserve Fund which at the end of the year exceeded one crore. The increase in revenue was mainly realised from customs receipts and almost all the expenditure was upon salaries paid to people of the country serving the Government in various departments, in social services and in the armed forces of the State. The fortunate financial position of the State was to a great extent due to war conditions. High prices of imports resulted in big customs receipts and the oil royalty remained the same as in 1362, though lower than it was in 1359 and 1360. The duration of the present output of Bahrain oil is an uncertain factor, customs revenue will undoubtedly drop when conditions return to normal and the future of the pearl industry is problematical. During the years while revenue is high and expansion and major works are curtailed by the war the State has the opportunity of adding as much as possible to the Reserve Fund with the object of ensuring an income from investments which it may well stand in need of in the future. Development and expansion were restricted for another year owing to the continued difficulties in obtaining all kinds of imported goods and because of the shortage of labour. No new projects were undertaken and the Government reduced its requirements of man power to the minimum in order not to compete in the labour market with employers who were engaged upon urgent and essential war work. The demand for both skilled and unskilled labour was so great that women and children were employed, for the first time, on building projects and foreign labour was imported from neighbouring countries. For these reasons the report of the Government's work during 1363 is' a static record restricted to departmental activities. A noticeable feature during the year was the marked improvement in the condition of the people of Bahrain, this was partly due to well paid work being available for everyone capable of working and partly owing to the smooth running of the rationing system. The general improvement was reflected in Public Health, the condition of school children and in the significant falling off in the numbers of poor people who applied for the free distribution of food which was arranged by the Government. Even the Shia Poor Relief Committee, responsible for relief measures in the villages, which used to stress the adverse conditions of the villagers in contrast to the Sunni townsfolk, grudgingly admitted that most of the villagers were now prosperous. Throughout the year thousands of labourers were supplied with rations at cheap rates by their employers, in addition to their regular rations which they were entitled to buy at the Government ration shops. The labourers' rations included rice, which was not available in the bazaar, and much of this commodity found its way to the Black Market where it was bought from the labourers by wealthy Arabs. When, after Japan came into the war, imports of rice ceased, the wealthy Arabs had stocks of rice and the working people had none.5 The employment which has so improved the state of things in Bahrain is temporary. In the coming year probably many of the men who are now working will be discharged. There is the prospect to be faced of unemployment in the future, possibly next year when many people may find themselves without work having become accustomed to a higher standard of living on good wages and valuable rations. The Government can only absorb a certain amount of labour but it may be that a solution to the problem will be found by the employ ment of Bahrain people in Saudi Arabia where important oil developments are in progress. There was no general decrease in the cost of living during the year though certain foodstuffs such as dates were subsidized by the Government and sold at very cheap prices. The Government decided not to purchase dates from Basrah in view of the stocks which were held and the high price which was demanded for Basrah dates. At the end of the year there were indications that the prices of certain goods were dropping as for example, Indian piece-goods. Once again the Bahrain Government imported and sold to the people at controlled prices wheat, barley and sugar and in addition the Government bought from the importers meat, tea, piece-goods and other essential commodities in order to ensure that these goods were made available to everybody at the proper price. Lack of co-operation on the part of the local merchants compelled the Government in the first place to set up as the general purchaser, importer and seller of foodstuffs for the country. When the merchants in the beginning were asked to assist they showed a complete absence of public spirit, admittedly most of them were foreigners, and were only interested in making big profits. Black Market trading, smuggling and land speculation continued and many people made fortunes out of dubious transactions. War prosperity and closer contacts with the influx of foreigners into Bahrain from the west and from India has not had a beneficial effect upon the people of the country who used to be, but are not now, honest, well mannered and contented. Though no serious crimes occurred during the year the increase in thieving was noticeable. The Budget for 1364 is a fairly conservative one. The revenue has been estimated at 48 lakhs, the anticipated expenditure is 38 lakhs and it is expected that 10 lakhs, the surplus of revenue over expenditure, will be added to the Reserve Fund. C. DALRYMPLE BELGRAVE, C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain.6 REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE, 1363. The total revenue of the State during 1363 was 55 lakhs, not including the Electric Supply Undertaking which although now entirely a Government concern has in the past been kept separate. Half of the whole revenue, Rs.27,88,000, was the royalty from oil, customs receipts produced Rs.20,40,000, the income from Reserve Fund was Rs.2,81,000 and the remaining 4 lakhs were derived from miscellaneous minor sources. The revenue was Rs.30,000 more than in 1362. Probably few countries where there is any form of administration and where social services are provided for the people enjoy such immunity from taxation as Bahrain. In Bahrain there is no income tax, no land tax, no zakat and no house tax except the small house and shop tax in the Manama and Muharraq municipal areas, in these two towns which have population of about 28.000 and 18,000 respectively the municipal house and shop taxes amount to about Rs.59,000 and Rs.17,300 per annum. Customs duties on the majority of imports are 5 per cent; on non-essential imports 10 per cent is charged and on tobacco and liquor 15 per cent is collected. The main difference between the revenue in 1363 and in 1362 was that in 1363 customs receipts were almost 6^ lakhs higher than in the previous year. In 1362 the sum of Rs.7,73,000 was received from the sale of foodstuffs which had been bought by the Government in 1361. The oil royalty in both years was almost the same, other sources of income produced slightly more, on the whole, in 1363 than in 1362. The total expenditure in 1363 was 33 lakhs, about two lakhs less than the estimated expen diture in the Budget. There was a difference of only Rs. 12,000 between the actual expenditure in the year 1362 and 1363. During the year Rs. 13,92,000 was added to the Reserve Fund. As in the previous years most of the expenditure was upon salaries of Government employees working in various branches of the administration in Social Services such as Health and Education, in the armed forces and in public Departments and also upon allowances to the Ruling Family which accounted for more than a third of the total expenditure.11 THE DIVING INDUSTRY. In 1363 the diving industry suffered a severe setback. Only 188 boats went out from Bahrain to the pearl banks which was the lowest number on record in 19 years. In other states in the Gulf the diving fleets were even more reduced than in Bahrain. From 1344 till 1350,1925—1931, between 504 and 538 boats were registered each year for diving. No written records exist before 1342 but there is every reason to believe that the fleet before this year was considerably larger and amounted to not less than 600 vessels. The Dawasir tribe who used to live at Budeya had 130 diving dhows, in the year under review only four dhows went diving from Budeya. When the Bahrain diving fleet numbered five or six hundred boats at least 20,000 men earned their livelihood from diving so almost the whole population was supported by this industry. In later years there was a decline in the number of diving boats with slight revivals after good seasons. The number of men who were employed decreased but not in strict ratio to the number of boats because these varied greatly in size and in the number of the crew. In 1363 the number of men employed in diving fell to about 5,000. Year. No. of Year. No. of Year.

Though the war closed all markets except India there was still a demand for pearls and people engaged in the trade did well during the last two or three seasons. The high cost of provisioning boats did not make the financing of them an uneconomic venture and when supplies are cheaper, after the war, diving should become a more profitable affair. It can reasonably be hoped that when conditions return to normal there will be a demand for pearls in those countries to which no pearls have been sent during the war years. The chief causes for the decrease in the number of Bahrain divers were ; the lucrative employ ment which for the time being was available on shore, the demand for boats to be used in trading or for carrying stone which produced bigger profits than diving and also, to a less extent, the changing outlook of the younger generation of Arabs, not the Bahama in the villages but especially those living in Muharraq and Hedd where in the past most of the divers were recruited. Youths with even a slender degree of education do not readily take to pearl diving though they may be sons of divers or Nakhudas or of pearl merchants who started life as ordinary divers and eventually became well-to-do men. Most of the leading Nakhudas and the older generation of pearl merchants were once divers themselves and the majority of them are illiterate though none the less capable of conducting their business. Bahrain has been dependent on the pearl industry for centuries and until recent times it provided work for many more men than those who are now employed or likely to be employed in future in the local oil industry. It would be regrettable and a misfortune for Bahrain were this very ancient indus try to die out and there seems some danger of this happening. Possibly when the war is over there will be a revival in diving which will offset the unemployment which is likely to exist when various war works are completed. A year or two ago there was unemployment in Bahrain and though permanent channels of employment are now greater than before, the population has undoubtedly increased, by an influx of foreign Arabs, and when the building schemes which are now being carried out are completed many thousands of people will be thrown out of work.12 If, after the war, steps have to be taken to relieve unemployment it may be necessary for the Bahrain Government to interest itself actively and financially in the diving industry in order to stimulate that enterprise. Apart from work in the oil field and agriculture, which now employs comparatively few people and which even if it were developed would not provide employment for any considerable proportion of the population, diving is the only native industry in Bahrain. If diving could be restored to something like its old position it would provide employment for a substantial part of the population. The 1363 season was moderately good. Out of 103 boats whose accounts were dealt with by the Government clerks the divers of 76 boats made more than their advances. Most of the men in the 27 boats which were not successful were divers who were released by their old Nakhudas to dive with new Nakhudas and according to diving law they paid one quarter of their earnings to their original Nakhudas. This situation was due to the shortage of divers which compelled many Nakhudas to abstain from taking their boats to sea. The pearl harvest was larger than last year in spite of there being fewer boats. Only one important pearl was found which was bought by Shaikh Mustapha bin Abdul Latif of Bombay. In the boat which made the biggest profits every diver earned Rs. 475 on the season and a puller earned Rs. 316. Pearl buyers on the whole did better than Nakhudas and divers. At the beginning of the season prices were high then they dropped and remained stationary till at the end of the season there was some activity on the market and prices rose. Low-grade pearls obtained good prices, Na'am sold for higher than last year but high grade pearls were difficult to dispose of. Pearl prices in Bahrain were as follows :— Sherin from .. Rs. 120 to Rs. 150 per chow. 50 20 Puller, 30 30 10 20 20 no The estimated value of the season's catch was Rs. 18,18,000, this being the amount paid to the Nakhudas and the divers by the purchasers of pearls, in the previous year the catch was estimated at Rs. 16,32,000. The average share of a diver was Rs. 165 and a puller earned Rs. no. As the advances amounted to Rs. 152 for a diver and Rs. 119 for a puller, the divers were better off on the season than the pullers who increased their debts by about nine rupees. Both this year and last year the month of Ramadhan fell during the diving season. It was decided last year that there should be no diving during Ramadhan although some persons argued that provided that the diving took place a certain distance away from Bahrain it would not be wrong to dive, however the opinions of the Kadis were contrary to lay opinion and the fleet remained in harbour throughout the month. The remaining period of the diving season, which is altogether four months and 10 days, was postponed until after Ramadhan and this procedure will continue for the next ten years until Ramadhan ceases to coincide with the diving season.

At the end of 1363 the strength of the State Police was as follows :— State Police. 4 Officers. Special Police. 1 Officer. 131 N.C.Os and men. 3 Civilians. Naturt. 173 Naturs. 298 N.C.Os and men. 36 Civilians. During the year 34 men were granted their discharge from the State Police, 15 of these men were discharged on medical grounds most of them having become too old to be able to carry out their duties, they were granted gratuities calculated on the length of their service. The other 19 men completed their four years' service and did not re-enlist for a further period. One death occurred during the year. Eighteen men wre seconded for service with the Royal Navy at Jufair. Twenty recruits were enlisted. Both the Police forces and the Naturs were under strength throughout the year but as the men who offered themselves for enlistment were of a very poor type it was considered desirable to postpone further recruiting until labour conditions became more normal. Police Pay. In 1362 the Police pay was increased from a basic rate of Rs.25 per month to Rs.27-8 per month with an additional allowance of Rs.3 per month and the Naturs, who do not receive rations, were granted a war allowance of 12^ per cent, bringing their pay to Rs.28-2 per month. During the year under review the following increased allowances were granted :— State Police. Rs.3 per month Long Service allowance for men with over six years' service. Rs.io per month additional war allowance to all men with more than four years' service who re-enlisted for a further period of two years. Rs.4 per month to men in the mounted sections. Special Police. Rs.y Rafaa allowance for men serving at Rafaa. Rs.io additional war allowance for men with four years' service enlisting for a further period. Rs.3 clothing allowance for men while serving in Manama. Naturs. Rs.13 per month additional war allowance. A Policeman with over four years' service in the State Police could draw the following pay and allowances, Basic Pay, Rs.27-8, Good Conduct Pay, Rs.3, Long Service Pay, Rs.3, War Allowance, Rs.io ; total pay and allowances Rs.43-8 and, in addition monthly rations costing the Government Rs.24 per month, which were worth in the local bazaar approximately Rs.37, according to controlled prices. Duties and Administration. Towards the end of the year there was some dissatisfaction among the Special Police who were quartered at Rafaa and employed on duties in the oil field. A number of men having completed their four years' service were unwilling to re-enlist partly because their duties prevented them from visiting their homes in Manama and Muharraq more than once or twice a month and partly because in some respects they were not as well off as the State Police. To remedy this situation an arrangement was made whereby every month a certain proportion of the Special Police were stationed in Manama where they shared the normal duties of the State Police and at the same time were able to have opportunities of visiting their families. This arrangement combined with the increase in war allowances produced a satisfactory result and the majority of the Special Police re-enlisted for a further two years when they completed their four years' contracted service. Although it was possible during the year to make a slight reduction in the number of places where Police guards were stationed yet almost half the force was continuously employed upon14 outpost duties, guard duties and patrols. The following permanent duties were undertaken by the State Police and the Natur Force :— State Police. Manama Police Station Muharraq Police Station Manama night patrol Muharraq night patrol Shaikh Hamad Bridge Agency Guard His Highness's Guard Traffic Control Hedd Police Station ,.

About 50 per cent, of the State Police took leave during the year, one month's pay in lieu of leave was granted to men who had over three months leave to their credit, in most cases men who were due three months leave took a month's pay and two months leave. For some time after the beginning of the war all leave had been cancelled which resulted in many of the Police accumulating long periods of leave. Daily routine parades were held at the Fort and there was one musketry course for recruits and for men who had previously failed. Owing to the shortage of men caused by other duties it was not possible for every Policeman to fire on the range during the year. Dry rations, rice, flour, ghee and dhall, were supplied to the Police, on payment, by the British Army, other rations were bought through a local contractor. The Military Authorities also sold to the State Police durries, blankets, murzi cloth, khaki caps and socks, some other general clothing stores were purchased in India. Many of the Police and Naturs were originally pearl divers and were indebted to their Nakhudas and in some cases they owed large sums. Every enlisted diver pays Rs .50 per annum to his Nakhuda on account of divmg debts. During 1363 over Rs .4,000 was recovered from the Police and Naturs and refunded to Nakhudas, during the year 21 men discharged their obligations to their Nakhudas. Among the various duties dealt with by the Police were checking car registrations, radio licenses, issuing permits for drummers and dancers who attend weddings and other occasions and issuing permits for visits to Nebi Salih island. Jail. During the year 221 persons were admitted to prison and 228 prisoners were released. The number is small in comparison to the population which is now probably in the neighbourhood of 100,000. Many of the prisoners were inveterate offenders who spend most of their lives in and out of jail. One prisoner died during the year and one execution was carried out. Capital sentences are dealt with by shooting, executions take place in public in front of the Fort, the State Police provide a firing squad. The prisoners at Jida jail worked during the year on the construction of a pier at Budeya, putting new ground under cultivation in the Government garden and weaving sailcloth and the material for the prisoner's clothes. Five hand looms were set up in a barasti building close to the jail and long term prisoners were taught to weave. It is hoped that this prison industry will develop, at the end of the year experiments were made in weaving durries with coloured patterns.15 Promotions. Sub-Inspector Abdul Karim bin Haji Sulman was promoted to the rank of Police Inspector. Head Havildar Mahmood Ismail was promoted to Sub-Inspector and there were various promotions among the lower grades. Law and order. There was a serious increase in traffic accidents. During the year there were 59 accident cases in which 16 people lost their lives, 9 persons received serious injuries and 37 people suffered slight injuries. In 11 cases the drivers who were responsible could not be traced. Most, but not all of these accidents, were due to the negligence or dangerous driving of the drivers. The heavy traffic on the roads has greatly increased, to the detriment of the roads and to the danger of the public. The increase is not in private cars but in heavy military vehicles and trucks, which are often over loaded, carrying workmen from the towns and distant villages over rough roads to their work at the oil fields. Almost all the drivers are local men, though some wear uniforms, and many of them have little experience in driving heavy vehicles. An indication of the increase in traffic is the fact that about 7,000 vehicles cross the Shaikh Hamad Bridge every week. List of Police Prosecutions in the Bahrain Courts 1363.

There were no crimes of a serious nature. The trial for murder in which the Police prosecuted concerned an affair on the Trucial Coast. Out of 387 theft cases which were reported to the Police 145 were taken to court, in 35 cases no charge was framed owing to insufficient evidence and in 207 cases the offenders could not be traced. Although the number of cases reported to or dealt with by the Police showed no striking increase yet the state of public morality and honesty as a whole has definitely deteriorated during the war years. Thieving has greatly increased, gambling and drinking are rampant and in spite of the efforts of the authorities war time offenses such as smuggling, profiteering and Black- Market trading have not been checked. Bahrain used to have a reputation for honesty, thefts were few and far between and property could safely be left unattended. This pleasant state of security no longer exists. Pilfering from steamers' cargoes, from military stores and from oil companies' premises has assumed serious dimensions, at one time there was an epidemic of housebreaking in Manama as well as thefts of tyres, batteries and spare parts from cars. There was no unemployment in Bahrain and the excuse of stealing in order to obtain food could not be made. The attitude of many of the culprits was that thefts of goods belonging to the services and companies were excusable because the goods did not belong to an individual. The temptation to steal was increased by the high prices obtainable for stolen property in the Black-Market both in Bahrain and abroad and the inadequate measures which were taken for the protection of the property were an incentive to theft. There has always been gambling in Bahrain but in the past it was on a small scale and restricted to the towns, now gambling has increased and has spread throughout the country villages. Men and youths who now have more money than they ever earned before gamble for sums which represent to them considerable amounts. Many of the secluded mosques among the gardens are now used as gambling houses. Gambling is a direct incentive to thieving especially in the case of servants. Drinking and illicit distilling have increased during the last few years. In the past drinking was confined to a few notorious persons ; gradually others followed their example and the habit began to spread but recently there has been a rapid and noticeable increase in the number of Arabs who drink liquor. Another habit which may have evil effects upon Bahrain in the future is the use of opium and hashish. For many years only Persians and Baluchis were known to use these drugs but now some of the Arabs can be recognised as opium addicts. The import of opium is forbidden but it is not difficult to conceal it so that it is not detected by the authorities. More than once during the year the Sheara Kadis have drawn the attention of the Government to the growing laxity of the people who, according to the Kadis, are beginning openly to disregard the Islamic rules of living. Action has been taken and the Bahrain Courts have inflicted severe penalties on Bahrain subjects convicted of drunkenness, being in possession of liquor or manufacturing liquor and youths caught of gambling have been publicly caned. The low prices of tea, sugar, textiles and other goods in Bahrain, due to price control, has encouraged the smuggling of these goods out to neighbouring countries where prices were in some cases 500 per cent, higher. The Police and Customs officials made a number of captures during the year but the smugglers who were caught probably represent only a small proportion of those engaged in smuggling. In many cases the smugglers were financed by influential backers on shore who regarded heavy fines and the imprisonment of their agents as a small matter in comparison to the profits which were made. Lack of co-operation by the public in reporting cases to the Police has aided black market traders and profiteers. A certain number of complaints emanated from the public but most of these cases originated from Government or Municipal complainants.17 BAHRAIN GOVERNMENT PUBLIC HEALTH REPORT, 1363—1944. By Dr. R. H. B. Snow, s.m.o. At no time in our history has the predominating machine so outrun the pressing problems of mind and spirit. Technology has outpaced sociology, and the medical world has not escaped unsca thed. For cold science has made a more exact approach to diagnosis to the detriment of humanism, and its tendency to dominate is beginning to undermine human understanding and sympathy. Social and economic adjustments must go hand in hand with an advancing civilisation, and in medicine the philosophy of a scientific humanism developed. The study of man is not complete without the knowledge of his childhood, upbringing, social, domestic and industrial life. Too late it is realised that the core of a malady sprang from a malad justment of one or other of these factors. Mind too controls the body, and distorts its functions in mysterious ways. To understand this, the environment where illness had its beginnings must be sought out, and its influence appreciated. A careful history of a patient's problem will reveal much and sometimes all, before any physical examination need be proceeded with. In the study of disease in this island, one is struck at once by the great proportion of what is preventable and would almost be non-existent in an enlightened country. To overcome this, mea sures to secure better standards of nutrition, better housing, and better education, and to reduce overcrowding, bad sanitation, industrial fatigue and hazards, and economic insecurity, are all needed. The inertia of the Easterner is too readily blamed on the climate without an appreciation of its environmental diseases. For example. Malaria and Dysentery have sapped for centuries a people's vitality. In Bahrain, there is an urgent need for a correlation of clinical, social and environmental studies to be brought about, and the day is now at hand when its mainspring should be a committee comprising, doctors, nutrition experts, sanitary inspectors, research and social workers, works mana gers, public health and local authorities, all in close collaboration over this. The hospital should then be able to point out with pride its declining numbers, and to an increase of erradication of diseases, at the source. This year has been one of exceptional health in some respects, helped by a not too hot summer, and freedom from epidemics. The incidence of dysentery has been halved, and Malaria reduced to the lowest recorded level. It is hoped this standard will be kept. The schools have more and more been exemplifying the care of the body, and the Services' camps have not been without their influence in promoting hygiene. Inoculations and vaccinations are now sought for, and people often request anti-malarial gangs to improve their districts. The seed has been sown, and an opportunity is now here to correlate in a many patterned design, all branches relating to health which will raise the general level of human fitness. The poten tialities are great, and only an understanding social medical outlook will bring this about. BAHRAIN GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL. Male Statistics 1363. Out-Patients. New Cases. Return Total. Cases.

Harbottle, who had been the Matron for nearly five years from the very beginning of the hospital, left in September for a more important post in Bagdad. She was an able administrator, who had laid down solid foundations for the future of nursing here, and her achievements during the difficult war years have been very greatly appreciated. Miss D, Ellson and Miss R. G. A. Maguire arrived during the latter part of the year; and we were extremely fortunate in having these Sisters of experience, newly recruited from Great Britain. Sister Ellson is at present the acting Matron, and Sister Maguire is Sister Tutor. The Schools. No regular visiting medical work could be carried out this year owing to lack of staff. A small Trachoma clinic however, was tried out as an experiment during the summer holidays. 28 boys showing early stages of the disease were chosen, and were treated daily by two doctors for six weeks. An intensiv e copper and silver course was given, and most of the boys were very co-operative and came regularly. After the ensuing Ramadan, the most promising cases were then weeded out, and asked to attend the hospital for continuative after-treatment under trained nurses, and this second course went on for another three months. After therefore six months total observation, eight out of the 28 original total lasted the full course, A good healing fibrosis was obtained in a few cases, and certain angular first stage lids showed promising semi-permanent healing, almost cured. The aptitude of Arab boys for enduring a long and trying course of treatment was thereby tested with fair success, and the experiment was well worth while. Greater care of the eyes is apparent in school boys and has been so before, due to Mr. Wakelin's hygiene measures which he has consistently been trying to promote, and a great deal is owed to him. Epidemics. 1 here were no epidemics, except for a small outbreak of smallpox in January which was quickly controlled. 2,737 more vaccinations were carried out by the medical department, and in addition a large number by the Quarantine Medical Officer, Dr. Steele. Typhoid occurred sporadically, from April to October, and many Arabs, more especially among the Sheikhs, came voluntarily for inoculations.19 There was no Typhus, although a special segregation camp and vaccine were held in readiness to use if the occasion arose. Dysentery figures were very good, exactly 50 per cent, less than the previous year. As usual, it was predominatingly Amoebic. Venereal Disease. This is on the increase. Fortunately, people know it can be cured and come readily. 1,194 cases were seen, 25 per cent, more than last year. 2,763 injections were given and much ' 693.' Ophthalmia. This is as prevalent as ever, chiefly in the form of acute and chronic trachoma. More and more, the Arab is realising the wisdom of more prolonged and intensive treatment, and repeatedly comes for advice. Malaria and anti-malarial control. The lowest recorded level was reached this year, namely 10 per cent, before anti-malarial mea sures were adopted it was 20 to 25 per cent. Slowly but surely its value is being realised, since control was started five years ago. A stricter supervision has been enforced in the towns this year, and domestic drinking water jars are regularly being broken, if houses refuse to comply with advice. All offenders are personally visited twice a week and punished accordingly, and a great deal of culicine breeding has thereby been reduced. In addition, every house in Manama and Muhharraq is examined once a week. Outside control in the gardens was reduced owing to lack of transport, and the major part of the work was therefore in the towns and their environs. R. A. F. anti-malarial control was handed over to their own expert personnel in September, owing to the increasing size of their Muharraq Camp. The R.A.F. Middle East medical Authorities were also very anxious to keep their incidence of malaria cases at ^ to 1 per cent., which is a very ambitious ideal, but very necessary for ground staff, many of whom are experts and not easily or quickly replaced. Total number of R.A.F. malaria patients this year was 56. The present treatment of Malaria is now a combined course of Quinine and atebrin, given together, with only 60 grains of Quinine used, and no Pamoquin. This is satisfactory in most cases, more especially benign tertian, but cannot be relied on for the malignant form. Treatment in these difficult cases is the same basically, but reinforced with two or three intramuscular or intravenous injections. It is very interesting to note that a similar combined treatment was occasionally used here since 1941. It has now been made the standard method of treatment for all the Services from 1944. A great deal of research has revealed that this method will probably be the most effective and most quinine saving, but as explained it is often found not strong enough for certain malignant types, unless reinforced by injections. The Services' programme of treatment is as follows :— Days i and 2. Quinine grains 30, and atebrin 2, daily. Days 3 and 4. Atebrin 3, daily. Day 5. Rest. Days 6, 7, 8 and 9. Quinine grains 15, and pamoquin 3, daily. The Bahrain Government present course of treatment is :— Days i and 2. The same but with Atebrin 3 daily. Days 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Atebrin 4 daily. (Quinine Hydrochlor; Injections may or may not be used during the first 3 days in grain 5 to 7^ doses.) The Bahrain Government course is also influenced by the fact that patients usually will not stay longer than from four to six days.20 The Services. I he Services Inpatient Scheme has now been in force for two and a half years, during which time a total of 1 ,194 inpatients have been admitted, that is, 918 Europeans and 276 non-European. I his year, 410 Kuropean patients came in, 308 from Bahrain and 102 from outside places—such as transit personnel. 1 he B.O.A .C. staff of Bahrain were also included in this scheme from April 1944. The following Services' inpatients were :— Arm y 17 R.A.F Nav y 48 B.O.A.C. 325 19 Their leading diseases were Heat exhaustion, Prickly Heat.

No fatal flying accidents were treated. There were two deaths only, (1) From severe burns and (2) From Jaundice and pyaemia. Over the whole year there was a higher incidence of R.A.F. patients due to the increasing numbers of their camp, which reached about 1000, and also to fewer ships putting in at the naval base. The Army personnel on the island was very small. The wards were comfortably full during the latter part of the year only. The usual R.A.K staff officiated in the wards, namely, one medical officer, four British sisters and a technician in the laboratory. Predominating Male Out-Patient Diseases.

Muharraq has always been the main bastion. The resident doctor there has a turnover of out-patients often exceeding half those treated in Manama. Apart from this, other out-dispensaries are with difficulty maintained, owing to lack of staff and consistently running transport. The main criticism in the medical work in Bahrain made by doctors and His Highness Shaikh Saliman is, that it is too much centralised in Manama, to the detriment of outside dispensaries and public health measures. This is true. Preventive medicine and out-clinics should be run at an equally high level as the Hospital work. Its aim is as important. Until more key staff are forthcoming however, this has been largely postponed. But certain efforts have been made, more especially over anti- malaria. Public health administration came into being in England largely at the beginning of the last century, and again made enormous strides after the Great War. Maternity, infant welfare, and school medical work are now perhaps its more important branches, specialised to a high degree • Milk and water supplies are largely controlled. Bad sanitation and its diseases Typhoid, Dysentery, and Cholera, are now almost unknown. All infectious diseases are notifiable. Tuberculosis is sought out at the source by house to house visits. Its treatment is effected in sanatoria and rehabilitation centres. Illegitimate children, the blind and deformed, the poor and the aged, are all accounted for in special homes and centres. In Bahrain, as soon after the war as possible, the beginnings of similar measures should be made and expanded year by year. A town water supply should be first laid down. Side by side with that, improved sanitation and an expert to supervise it. Indiscriminate squatting would become a legal offence, and disposal of city refuse rendered innocuous and better controlled. All Bahrain Government schools should be regularly inspected and treated by a medical staff trained for this alone. Maternity, infant welfare, and health visiting, would become a special ever expanding department. These two medical bodies alone would radically change the health and outlook of the next generation of Bahrain. Certain institutions to be set up, now badly needed, would come into force for tuberculosis, lepers, and lunatics. Lastly, the villages. Travelling dispensaries are needed to operate from certain main centres probably Manama, Muharraq, and Rifa'a. His Highness has himself suggested that a resident doctor be placed in Rifa a to form a centre there, and to be responsible for visiting the main villages south, east and west—such as, Sitra, Karazkan, Zillag, Ali and Bori. With the achievement of all these measures, a valuable check on the background and treatment of all future in-patients in the hospital would be attained, and particularly on observing their after- treatment when they return to their homes. And from thenceforth, slowly but surely, the cause of disease, the disease itself, and the dangers of its recurrence, would be reduced to the minimum FEMALE STATISTICS 1363. Report hy Dr. I. M. A.

The medical work amongst women has been much curtailed this year owing to inadequate nursing staff. The Indian nurses whose contracts finish do not return to Bahrain because at present they are finding so easily more lucrative posts in India. It has therefore been no longer possible to have a resident nurse at Moharraq and Suk-al-Khamis. Every effort is being made to fill these vacancies in the nursing staff, and also to provide again for house to house health visiting, Child-Welfare Clinic. vSince the issue of free Klim has stopped this clinic has practically ceased to exist. A negligible number of mothers has attended regularly, who send daily for free cow's milk for their babies ; the other have just stopped attending. The Girls' Schools. Medical inspection of all girls in the four schools was carried out during the year. A nurse has attended Manama School (where the need was greatest) to carry out treatment twice weekly. During the first part of the year this was done also at Moharraq and Hidd Schools but the visits had to be discontinued owing to shortage of both nurses and transport. It is intended that a teacher from each school shall be trained to carry out simple treatment.27 Venereal Disease. The statistics show an alarming increase in number of cases of V.D, and also in the number of abortions. Atersia. The use of salt and alum in midwifery cases conducted by the Arabs continues in spite of all advice, and during the year many cases have been seen among quite young women only recently confined for the first time, and now injured irreparably for life, much work will be required to eradicate this evil. LAND REGISTRATION DEPARTMENT. {From the report of K han S ahib M ohammed K halil M emon, Superintendent, Land Registration Department). Only routine work was done during the year, there were no special surveys. Fees amounting to Ks. 22,348 were collected from registrations on 738 sales, gifts and registrations of titles, though the number of registrations was less than in 1362 yet the fees were almost double owing to the high prices which were paid by purchasers of property. Out of the registrations 536 were sales, 147 were regis tration of titles and 55 were gifts. During the first half of the year the boom in land values appeared to have reached its height, in the second-half of the year prices remained stationary and there was less demand for properties. It was generally believed that owing to the expansion of various commercial concerns and the services the value of land in Bahrain was unlikely to drop after the war. This assumption may be correct in the case of house property in Manama but it is unlikely to be true in the case of gardens in distant parts of the islands many of which have been bought at excessively high prices by naturalised Bahrain subjects and foreigners who have made fortunes from war time trading. Though the price of dates caused a rise in garden rents this condition is only a temporary one. The value of house property has risen partly owing to the impossibility of building at present and because of the high cost of repairs but the following list of transactions in open ground or small gardens which took place during the year gives an indication of the present trend of land values Property.

The Superintendent of the Land Registration Department and some of the Land Department staff assisted in the reorganisation of the Judicial Department.28 Over two hundred small plots of grounds are let to occupants of ' barasti ' huts on the out skirts of Manama. The tenants are mostly foreigners and the demand for plots of land is increasing. The ground rent is nominal, eleven annas per month for a plot measuring 45 X45 feet but the system ensures that the Government retains the ownership of the ground. A number of applications were received from persons wishing to buy Government land, many of these were rejected as it was evident that the purchasers wanted the land in order to speculate and not for occupation, other applications were withdrawn owing to the high valuation set by the Govern ment which was based upon the average of land values or rentals in the immediate neighbourhood of the site. Sales of Government land produced approximately Rs. 3,000. JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT. Bahrain Courts. During the year 641 cases were heard in the Bahrain Court out of which 306 were criminal cases, 142 were civil suits and 193 were land cases. There was a very large increase in the number of criminal cases but the majority of them were offenses against the Food Control regulations. I* ines amounting to over Rs. 34,000 were collected. The court heard no bankruptcy or estate cases. The total amount collected in court fees amounted to Rs. 8,000. The only case of outstanding interest was one in which a wealthy Arab woman was tried for a theft of a large sum of money which she was alleged to have stolen from her father at the time of his death from plague over twenty years ago. 1 he case was made by the representative of various heirs of the defendant's father, Ali bin Abdulla Abul, a merchant of Muharraq. The woman, who was blind, appeared herself in court during a large number of hearings and defended herself with vigour and intelligence. The charge was not proved and after the case had closed the woman filed a suit against Ali bin Abdulla charging him with having withheld from her part of her inheritance from her father. The case caused considerable public interest. In the Small Court 764 cases were heard, in addition to execution suits, of which 218 were still pending at the end of the year. The Sunni Shera Court dealt with 225 cases, mostly divorce, inheritance and estate cases. At the end of the year 60 cases were still unsettled. In the Shia Shera Court 77 cases were heard of which 12 were pending at the end of the year. The Majlis Tajara was referred to by the Bahrain Courts in 45 cases. There were 6 appeals from Shera judgments to the Shia Appeal Kadi and 31 appeals were made in cases from the other courts of which all but 10 were disposed of. Towards the end of the year a number of changes were made in the Bahrain Courts. Mr. Salim at Arayedh who had some previous experience in the Bombay High Court was transferred from the Education Department and appointed as Superintendent of the Judicial Department. There was a reallocation of the duties of the clerical staff and new methods were introduced in the system of filing cases. All cases for the last 20 years were sorted and rearranged. The Bahrain Court previously consisted of two Magistrates who sat together on four days of the week and with the Adviser on one day. The two Magistrates now sit separately, in adjoining court rooms, on four days and once in the week they and the Adviser sit together. By this arrangement the hearing of cases has been considerably speeded up with the result that within a few months all pending cases should be disposed of. Ihe system of alloting both old and new cases to the two courts is automatic and neither the parties or the Magistrates are aware, until summons are issued, in which court cases will be heard. 1 his arrangement has much to commend itself. Shaikh Rashid bin Mohammed, the third Magistrate on the Bahrain Court, retired during the year owing to his increasing blindness and ill-health. Shaikh Rashid was for many years the President of the Majlis Tajara before being appointed a Magistrate on the Bahrain Court. New legislation was introduced to control increases in the rents of buildings. This became necessary owing to the abnormal demand for houses which led to gross profiteering by landlords. Ihe regulation was extended to include shops, storehouses, etc., etc., at the request of a number of local merchants. No cases under the new regulation were made in the Bahrain Courts.29 MANAMA MUNICIPALITY. {From the report of the Municipal Secretary, Mr. Mohamed Saleh Shater.) The revenue in 1363 was Rs. 1 ,28,000, the principal sources of revenue were ; shop tax, producing Rs. 33,900, Government subsidy, Rs. 24,000, house tax which produced Rs. 25,000 and a quarter of the vehicle tax, collected by the Government, which amounted to over Rs. 8,000. The expenditure was Rs. 1 ,43,000. The largest items of expenditure were town cleaning, Rs. 29,800, road repairs, Rs. 26,100, Municipal staff, Rs. 25,700 and transport, Rs. 24,200. Excess of expenditure over revenue was Rs. 15,000, this was met from the Municipality's reserve fund which at the end of the year amounted to Rs. 1 ,16,000. No important major works were carried out owing to the difficulty in obtaining labour and the high cost of work and the price of materials. The Municipality confined itself to routine duties such as town cleaning and keeping roads and streets in as good order as possible. A portion of the unreclaimed sea shore, inside the Sea Road on the Manama waterfront belonging to Shaikh Mubarak bin Hamad was filled with stone at his expense and an area on the south of the town belonging to Khan Bahadur Abdul Aziz al Kosaibi was filled with town rubbish with a covering of earth also at the owner's expense. No further progress was made in filling other sections of sea inside the Sea Road. These areas are all privately owned and the high cost of stone and lack of transport for carrying sand from Suk al Khamis makes the cost of such reclamation prohibitive. The usual town cleaning was carried out throughout the year and the streets were watered during the summer. The lack of cement and both metal and eathenware drain pipes has caused difficulty over house drainage as gutch is unsuitable for use where it is in contact with water. Over a hundred householders applied to the Municipality to repair house drains. During the year over 3,000 dead animals were removed and burned at Suk al Khamis. The main sewer from the Municipal Garden to the sea was cleaned out and a number of masonry rubbish containers were built. New shelters were erected to protect the trees on the streets. The attempt over many years to grow trees along the main roads has only met with small success, the proportion of trees which die or are blown over is extremely high. After each rainy season a number of trees die from salt poisoning which results from the rain splashing the salty soil against the trees. Several thousands of trees have been planted along the roads and new trees are continuously being planted but only a few hundreds are flourishing. The Municipality continued to take a large and active part in rationing and food control, not only in Manama but in all the villages in Bahrain island. Ration cards for Manama, the villages and for Hedd were issued by the Manama Municipality. The Municipal authorities supervised 90 shops where controlled goods were sold and 14 Government ration shops. During the first half of the year the Municipality arranged the sale to the local butchers of over 17,000 sheep and goats and 1.400 head of cattle and in the second part of the year the Municipality took over the direct purchase and sale of meat to the public on behalf of the Food Control. The various duties connected with rationing and food control which are now undertaken by the staff of the Manama Municipality probably occupy them more than do their normal municipal duties. On the suggestion of the Government the Municipal Council took up the question of ruined stone houses which exist in the south districts of the town. These houses have been in a state of semi ruin for many years and were used for unsuitable purposes. The owners were given a time m which to demolish them or to repair them or to wall them in, in almost every case the owners walled them in. The Council met 17 times during the year and the Inspection sub-committee met 20 times. During the year the Municipal rules were revised and edited. A war allowance, at the same rate as that granted in other Government Departments, was approved for the Municipal employees.30 MANAMA MUNICIPALITY BUDGET, 1364. Revenue.

Finance. The revenue for 1363 was Rs. 58,600, this was 15 per cent, higher than the previous year's revenue and higher than any other year during the sixteen years that the Muharraq Municipality has existed. Taxes were collected without difficulty owing to the prosperous condition of the towns folk, many of the Muharraq merchants acquired sudden wealth from business transactions and both shopkeepers and labourers earned good money during the year. The number of empty houses decreased and though no new houses were built owing to lack of building materials there was active buying and selling of properties. In spite of some opposition the Municipality was able to introduce a charge for water piped from public wells into private house. The expenditure during the year was Rs. 63,800, about Rs. 5,000 more than the revenue. In the 1363 Budget a deficit of Rs. 12,500 had been expected. Owing to the shortage of labour, the excessively high cost of carrying out any work and because no provision had been made in the Budget for new projects the Municipality confined its activities to essential and routine duties. The high expenditure was due to the increased rate of labourers' wages and the high cost of materials. Even the normal functions of the Municipality such as town cleaning and road repairs cost considerably more than had been allowed for in the Budget. Municipal sweepers who at the beginning of the year were satisfied with from 12 to 14 annas a day were receiving from Rs. 1-11 to Rs. 2 a day at the end of the year. The price of gutch, stone and sand rose steeply, a bag of gutch which at the beginning of the year cost 10 to 12 annas could not be obtained at the end of the year for less than Rs. 2-13.31 The Budget for 1364 includes the additional grant of Rs. 1,000 per month from the Bahrain Government. Revenue from Municipal taxes has been assessed at slightly less than last year s revenue and the expenditure provides only for routine work. In spite of the prosperous condition of the people and the increased expenditure by the Municipality the Municipal taxes have not been raised. Out of 3,917 houses only 50 pay more than Re. 1 per month, the majority pay between 3 annas and 12 annas monthly and 1,400 are unproductive. Municipal Activities. During the year the Municipal authorities endeavoured to induce the public to adopt more hygienic measures in sanitary matters by preventing open spaces and street corners from being used as rubbish heaps and public conveniences. Though the inhabitants of the town are not backward in complaining about the prevalence of malaria, dysentery and eye diseases yet they themselves neglect taking measures to prevent the breeding of flies and mosquitoes. The great increase in heavy traffic and the floods caused by rain and exceptionally high tides caused much damage to roads and the shortage of municipal transport which was required for hauling mud and sand resulted in a deterioration in the state of roads and streets. The dust which was stirred on the roads during the summer by the motor traffic became a source of inconvenience to the people of the town. A fire engine which can also be used for watering roads is urgently needed in Muharraq. The Municipality during the year codified the municipal rules and regulations. A sub committee of the Council undertook this work which was approved after considerable discussion and some disagreements. Endeavours were made to improve the fish market, meat market and slaughter house but as these places were privately owned only small improvements were made, however this section of the market was provided with a water supply. An enquiry was held as to the ownership of artesian wells in the town many of which were paid for, many years ago, by local merchants who installed them for the use of the community. The repair and upkeep of the wells is paid for by the Municipality and the cost of their upkeep is now high. A ruling was made, in spite of strong opposition, that people taking water from public wells by pipes to their houses should pay a water rate. A new road was opened in Hedd town and some reclamation of swampy ground was effected. The people of Hedd do not at present pay any municipal taxes. The Municipality continued to take an active part in the issuing of ration cards, distribution of food supplies and the enforcement of price control. During half of the year the Municipality undertook the sale and distribution of meat in Muharraq and in Hedd. Meat is not bought as extensively in Muharraq as it is in Manama except during the month of Ramadhan. No big schemes or improvements are contemplated during 13^4 though it is hoped that the Municipality will be able to continue widening certain streets in the town by removing buildings on dangerous corners. As neither public authorities or private people are able to do any building because the materials for necessary repairs are difficult to obtain the general appearance of the town has become somewhat shabby. Various improvements to the town of Muharraq are under consideration but these works cannot be carried out until local conditions have changed making development possible. It has been suggested that the road along the seafront of Muharraq should be extended southwards from the pier, it is also proposed that a road should be made from the eastern shore of the town to the open land on the north. The Municipal offices are now housed in a hired building, it would be more satisfactory if a municipal building could be erected possibly above the municipal shops near the pier, but these and many other projects cannot be undertaken at present.33 Teaching Staff.

The rapid increase in the number of boys in the Infants' Schools in the past few years is now making itself felt in the Primary Classes. Of the 385 boys who left school at the end of the year only a very few were from the Infants. These few were almost entirely from the Village Schools. We can therefore expect considerable growth of the town Primary Schools in the next few years. Of these 385 boys 140 were from the Village Schools, the majority of whom obtained work with the Oil Company. They were between the ages of 12 and 15 years. The present tendency is for villagers to go to school for about 4 years and then to obtain work away from their homes, whereas the town boys complete at least their seven years of Infants and Primary School education. Children are now entering the schools at six or seven years, some even at five instead of at 11 or 12 as formerly so that the average age in each class is steadily falling. Only a very few of the Secondary School boys are over 16. It is gratifying to see that most of the ruling family are now sending their young children to school. 2. Staff. The figures for Staff show an increase of only three over last year. 19 teachers resigned in 1363, most of them before the Summer Holiday, in order to obtain jobs elsewhere. Many of them were senior teachers who had been with us many years. As far as possible these were replaced by local men but for some months we were very much understaffed. At the end of September 1944 (Shawwal 1363), 12 fully trained and experienced Egyptian teachers were engaged, being seconded to this Government by the Ministry of Education, Cairo. Their arrival was delayed owing to difficulties of transport and they did not reach Bahrain until mid-November, six weeks after the start of term. These men are working in the Secondary and town Primary Schools. It is still early to give a true estimate of their worth but from the work already done it appears that they will have a very beneficial influence on the schools. In March 1944 (Robia al Awwal 1363), a very successful conference was held when papers were read and discussions held on Educational Theory and Practice. Although attendance was voluntary every teacher, without exception, attended. The Director of Education of Kuwait, Ali Haikal, was present and read two papers. In October 1944 (Shawwal 1363), three of our best local teachers were sent to Egypt to study for a year at the Abdul Aziz Training School for Primary School Teachers. A special course has been arranged in order to give them the maximum experience in the time.34 Local teachers are now receiving regular instruction in teaching methods and are showing a steady improvement. Two of the reasons why the Egyptian teachers have been so well received by the Bahrain staff is that the gap between them is far less than that it would have been a few years ago and also that the new comers are so ready to assist their colleagues. In the first B.B.C. Poetry Competition Sayyid Redhi, a Bahrani teacher at the New Primary School, Manama, was awarded third prize. 3. The Secondary School. Entries to the Secondary School at the beginning of the new term were rather less than in former years. This was due to the fact that a boy who has completed his primary education speaks and writes English well and can find work at a salary of about Rs. 50 per mensem. 1 hus 10 boys who would in more normal times have gone on to the Secondary School obtained well paid jobs with the Oil Company and other firms. Our schools are beginning to attract pupils from areas outside Bahrain. Three boys from Hassa joined the Secondary School in October where they had completed their primary education. The Secondary School suffered more than any other from lack of staff during the year. In January 1944, (Dil Hajj 1362) both the Head Master and the Mathematics Master resigned without notice owing to family reasons. Few local men have sufficient qualifications for such work and in any case they are already working elsewhere. For a time we were fortunate in having the services of a senior clerk on loan from the Public Relations Office but this was only a temporary measure. For the rest of the year we were forced to carry on with the two remaining masters who were teaching every period of the day and the Director who taught Mathematics and Science, By combining two classes in one whenever possible we were able to keep the school open until the end of the year. A further setback was the delayed arrival of the Egyptians. At the opening of term the only Master left was the English teacher. A special course was arranged for the First Form only consisting of English and Mathematics only. As soon as the Egyptians arrived three of them were posted to the school and the normal programme began. The standard of Forms II and III is still low, particularly in Mathematics and Science. This is because of their lack of good primary schooling. The First Form, most of the boys of which have been through the reorganised schools in the past four years, is on a level with that of most good Arab Secondary Schools. The average age in this form is 13 years. At the beginning of the school year in October 1944, (Shawwal 1363) the three best boys from Form III were sent to Egypt by the Government to join the Saidieh Secondary School in Cairo, where they are receiving their education at the expense of the Egyptian Ministry of Education. One of them is being supported by the Bahrain Government and the other two by their parents. All three were placed in the First Form as they have not studied French or Science and are weak in Mathematics. A fourth boy has gone to the American Secondary School in Baghdad. The British Council has renewed Yusif Shirawi's scholarship at Beirut University for another year. He is now in the 4th year Preparatory Class and is expected to join the Freshman's course this year. 4. The Hostel. Throughout the year the Hostel has been filled to capacity. 10 places are now reserved for boys from the Technical School and 4 for villagers. In addition to Bahrainis we have had a young Sheikh from the Trucial Coast and two boys from Qatar. The Hostel is becoming the hub of Bahrain educational life. It is used for meetings, lectures, cinema shows and parties. It has been a major factor in bringing about that sense of unity which has developed both among the boys and masters of the different schools.35 5. The Primary Schools. A fourth class was added to the New School, Manama, in October thus completing the primary section. In the West School, Manama, and at Muharraq it was found necessary to make still further divisions in the Infant School in order to accommodate the new boys. The plan for opening a second school in Muharraq somewhere in the town itself had to be postponed owing to the lack of staff and the difficulty of finding a suitable building. All the Primary Schools are now up to the standard of the Egyptian Schools. 6. The Village Schools. Great improvement has been made in the Khamis School where particular attention has been paid to health and cleanliness. Every boy is made to wash once a day and to bath once a week in the spring near the school. The ban on head-robes during school hours has brought about a very great improvement. Cases of sore heads, instead of being universal are now very rare indeed. This is true of all schools. Bread is provided daily for all village children with a resultant improvement in physique and school work. The striking feature of village school boys a few years ago was a listlessness—a complete lack of interest in life. This has now changed. Village boys can be seen—and heard—running round between lessons laughing and singing or having a lively tussel in the playground. This is true of Khamis, Budayya and Rufa but not as yet of Sitra. 7. Medical. A doctor could not be spared this year for the schools but regular supplies of medicines were provided. In March 1944, (Robia al Awwal 1363) a thorough examination of eyes was made in the town schools. The results showed that 78 per cent, of the pupils were suffering from Trachoma in one stage or another. Under present conditions it would be impossible to treat all these cases, but during the summer holiday special arrangements were made for 38 boys, whom the Doctor thought would respond to treatment, to attend the Hostel daily for three months. Beds were provided so that after treatment the patients could rest if they wished. 24 attended regularly with marked improvement in most cases. In the Autumn there was a serious epidemic of acute conjunctivitis. In some schools as many as 50 per cent, of the pupils suffered from it and many lost the sight of one eye while several • mostly villagers, were left blind. It was difficult to take any steps to alleviate the trouble as the cure is continual irrigation and as soon as a boy was infected he remained in his home. 8. Equipment. It is unfortunate that the time when the schools have reached the point where expansion is essential should occur when difficulties in obtaining equipment are at a maximum. It has only been possible to keep the present number of pupils supplied with the minimum requisite materials by exercising the most rigid economy over a long period. It is now two years since we recei\ed our last supply of paper, chalk and other essentials. Paper is the main problem. Neither India nor the United Kingdom can supply us. Slates are used in all classes but their usefulness is limited, especially in the higher forms. The stock of chalk is also very low but supplies, adequate until the end of the term, have been obtained from Kuwait and the British Council in Cairo. Text books are more easy to obtain but they are very expensive and very poorly bound and therefore do not last very long. Each boy must rebind any books that he wishes to take home for studying. Furniture made locally is still obtainable but is of poor quality and high in price. It would have been possible, before the war, to furnish all the schools completely with the most modern equipment for less than was spent on the few additions made in the past year.36 Extra-mural Activities. During the Spring Holiday in February 1944 (Safar 1363), a five day camp was held at Budayya. 100 boys ,and masters from all schools took part. Parents contributed food in the form of rice, sugar, meat, etc., and a charge of Rs.5 per boy was made. It was a great success, not the least part of which was the easy mining of the different schools and the willingness with which all undertook manual and menial tasks. In April (Robia al Awwal), the Annual Athletics Sports were held. An unusual feature was the inclusion of events open to the R.A.F., the Police, and the Levies, which were won by the Education team. Apart from these two occasions there was very little sports activity before the summer holiday root ball matches were again difficult to organise because teams feared to be beaten. In November the Physical Training Instructor arrived from Egypt. He was Champion oxer of All Egypt from 1940-42. He has taken charge of Physical Training in all the schools, and an improvement is already noticeable. Rather than hold inter-school matches mixed teams are formed. When the time is ripe we can re-introduce them. \ 'sits to places of interest are included in the programme for all schools. The most popular were those to the Naval Base, the Aerodrome at Muharraq, the tombs and pottery works at Ali and the weaving at Beni Jumra. The public performance of school plays has given place to more intimate gatherings for the eneht of parents and friends. These vary in character. It may be a small play or an exhibition of handwork or a drill display by the infants. They are always well attended and much enjoyed. arents frequently visit the schools during working hours and now take a very keen interest in all that goes on. Broadcasts by the pupils and teachers have done much to encourage this interest. A week rarely goes by without a visit from a member of the American or British Air Forces Our boys and teachers have responded to this by arranging parties and outings for the men the most ambitious of which was at the end of the summer term when an Arab dinner party for 90 was e d m the Hostel. In other ways too we are attempting to interest these men in the life of the people around them. Outings to interesting places in the island have been arranged and a series of talks on local topics has been given with the co-operation of some of the school staff. At the close of the year night classes were opened in Manama and Muharraq. The subiects include English, Commerce and Arabic. They are being very well patronised. 10. Grants and Donations. In * tarch ( Safar ). th « British Council presented the Secondary Sehool with a very excellent English Library of books suitable for boys. . K1 v'-fr be6i ' n i ins 0f the SCh001 year in October (Shawwal), the Bahrain Petroleum Company es a hshed four scholarships of Rs.iooo each per annum which are open to Secondary and Technical Schoolboys. This is a gesture on the part of the Company to encourage young Bahrainis to continue eir education and it does not involve any obligation to serve in the Company. Two boys were se ected from each school. One of the conditions is that they must live in the Hostel so that they may benefit by the best our system can provide. The Oil Company have also presented a very fine radio set to the Secondary School and Hostel. theBrhi'shf 86 ™^ 1 t0 ShiPPing diffiCUltieS the 16 mm - Sou ' d Projector presented by the British Council reached Bahrain safely at the end of the year. In addition t0 the Secondary School Library the British Council provided from 50 to 60 new Enghsh books per quarter from which a library of about 400 books has been built up. This is used by the Enghsh-speaking community of Bahrain. Periodicals are also sent out regularly lor distribution. The British Council has also assisted the seven clubs by presenting books and periodicals in English and Arabic on a generous scale.37 11. The Director paid a visit to Kuwait in April (Robia al Awwal). 12. Finance. There was a further increase in expenditure for the year 1363 of Rs. 60,000 making a total of Rs. 2,10,000. Estimated.

GOVERNMENT GIRLS' SCHOOLS. [Report by Mrs. Belgrave, Directress of Female Education.) The progress in the Girls' Schools was very definite this year. In all the Schools additional classes were added in the Junior and Kindergarten sections and both in Hedd and Rafaa the number of girls attending school was twice as many as during the previous year. Owing to the present difficulties in building no new class rooms or schools were made but in Muharraq a room which was not previously used was converted into a class room and at Hedd and Muharraq large barastis were put up in the school compounds and used as class rooms. When the war is over and building becomes possible all the schools will require enlarging as in spite of temporary expedients a number of girls who wanted to attend the schools were turned away because there was no room and not enough teachers to cope with still more classes. Almost all the girls who took their school leaving certificates at the end of the term were taken on as teachers but more teachers than emerge from the schools are required to provide for the increasing demand for education. A new school was opened in Manama in the Shia quarter close to the Municipal Garden. The Government rented from the Minors' Department a large Arab style house which was wakf for the descendants of Abdu Ali bin Rajab, at one time a leading pearl merchant. Repairs and alterations were carried out and the building was made into an excellent school with a number of light airy class rooms. The new school opened two months after the beginning of term and in a very short time over two hundred girls were attending it, a large percentage of them were Bahama, many of them from the leading Shia families who in the past have been rather backward in sending their girls to school. The teaching staff was increased during the year. Mrs. Sawaf, who was for several years the Headmistress of the Muharraq school, was made Inspectress of Girls' Schools ; three new Syrian teachers were obtained from Syria and ten new local teachers were engaged bringing the number of the teaching staff up to 50. In Manama and Muharraq schools Syrian teachers were appointed as headmistresses and second mistresses but the headmistress of the new Manama school was a Bahrain girl who was trained at British Syrian Training College in Beyrout. Owing to the difficulties over travelling under war conditions no Bahrain girls can be sent to Syria to study teaching at present but it is hoped that when the war is over more Bahrain girls will be able to go for training abroad. There used to be a very great difference in the standard of the various schools. A great effort was made this term to bring all the schools as far as possible up to the same standard so that girls moving from one place to another could enter the same classes in any of the Government schools. It is the customs in Bahrain for families who can afford to do so to move from Muharraq to Manama in the summer and the children attend the schools in whichever town they are living.38 Meetings were held at regular intervals and attended by the teachers from all the schools for discussions about school affairs, problems and difficulties. One of the main difficulties during the year was the lack of necessary materials such as exercise books, which could only be got at a prohibitive price, slates, which were unobtainable and chalk of which only a very small quantity was available. No new kindergarten materials could be bought but the teachers showed great ingenuity in utilising odd scraps and simple things such as shells, dry palm fronds, match boxes and old Christmas cards for kindergarten work. It was again impossible to give cooking lessons, which were useful and very popular, owing to the strict rationing of food. The annual needlework Exhibition was held at 'the Palace by kind permission of His Highness Shaikh Sulman and in spite of the difficulty in obtaining materials and threads more work was shown than in previous years. Some linens and other materials were obtained from India but unfortunately much of this consignment was stolen en route. All the work which was for sale was sold and twice the amount of work which was on show could have been sold to the very large number of visitors who came to the exhibition. The proceeds from the sale of work amounted to Rs.5,907. A local merchant offered to buy up the whole exhibition for a large sum but this was not considered desirable. Much of the embroidery was extremely well done and some of the best work was by pupils of the lower grades. Prizes were given from the best work done by a girl from each school. No schools plays were performed but there was an end of term prize-giving and entertainment for all the schools in the Muharraq school building which was attended by an enormous crowd of mothers and female relations. The prizes were given away by the wife of His Highness the Ruler and many of the ladies of the Ruling Family were present at the function. The Lady Doctor, Dr. Doeg, visited the Manama school and examined every student, these medical examinations took time but it is hoped that in future similar medical examination will be carried out in all the schools. A nurse from the Government Hospital made regular weekly visits to the Muharraq and Manama schools. There was a visible improvement this year in the girls' health mainly owing to prosperous local conditions but partly due to the girls getting proper medical attention and regular exercise. The number of girls at the schools at the end of the year was as follows :— Manama school .. .. .. .. .. .. 353 Manama New school .. .. .. .. .. 210 Muharraq school .. .. .. .. .. 300 Hedd school .. .. .. .. .. .. 165 Rafaa school .. .. .. .. .. .. 139 1,167 The total expenditure on Girls' Education in 1363 was Rs.57,300, the estimated expenditure for 1364 is Rs. 80,000. The increase is owing to the greater number of teachers, higher war allowances and the high price of school equipment. THE TECHNICAL SCHOOL. {Report by Mr. G. E. Hutchings, Principal, Technical School.) Students. During the year 1363 the number of students in the Technical School has dropped considerably. This is mainly due to the increased employment of local workers on military and other development schemes in Bahrain. Boys with even the minimum of practical training have been much in demand, and the prospect of good wages has tempted many to leave the school after only a brief attendance. The summer recruitment yielded only 22 new pupils of satisfactory standard, again because employ ment is attracting boys who might normally take up technical courses after passing through the middle classes of the Primary Schools. Although the pressing demand for labour of all kinds is a temporary condition it is fairly certain that new developments in the oil undertaking, in air transport and39 certain of the public services will still require considerable numbers of permanent skilled workers after the initial construction work is finished and most of the coolie labour dispersed. When this is realised by the public technical training is likely to recover favour. It should be remembered, however, that the prospect of secure employment with good wages is an inducement which appeals much more to Europeans than to the peoples in the east unaccustomed to an industrial economy. The latter preserve a more independent outlook and an indifference to the risk of poverty which the European finds it hard to understand. A fair proportion of the 1 echmcal School pupils value their training as a possible means of establishment in independent business rather than a qualification for wage earning, an idea which deserves every encouragement. It is unfortunate that boys who have left the school during the past few years have been unable to procure for them selves even the most necessary tools for the exercise of their crafts. This factor has favoured employment in places where the equipment is all provided, or more often, the adoption of occupations not connected at all with the boys handicraft training. Two of the Scholarships given by the Bahrain Petroleum Company for education in Bahrain were allocated to the Technical School. They were awarded on the basis of selection by interview to two promising boys already attending the school. The value of the scholarships is Rs. 1,000 per annum each, to be expended as necessary on tuition, residence, clothing and pocket-money, with provision for a savings account to be applied to the establishment of the holders in appropriate careers. The award of the scholarships is not conditional in any way on the holders joining the service of the Company. The Government has undertaken the cost of training three ex-1 echmcal School students in the Egyptian Technical Secondary School, Cairo, with a view to their qualifying as technical teachers. For this course three students were selected who had completed three years' work in the Bahrain Technical School including a period of special tuition during 1362-63. Their work in Cairo began in October 1944 under the joint direction of the Egyptian Ministry of Education and the British Council. The three students have elected to qualify in Mechanical, Electrical and Automobile Engineering respectively, their courses covering practical work as well as theoretical studies. Satisfactory reports on their initial progress have been received. Staff. At midsummer the Principal of the School took over for a time the duties of the State Engineer and has since remained in charge of Government petroleum inspection. In order to provide for these additional services a great part of the internal work of the Technical School was turned over to one of the Syrian staff, Said Tabarra, in the new capacity of Head Teacher. This arrangement has so far proved very satisfactory. The mechanical workshop instructor retired at the end of his contract at the end of the school year 1362-63 and has been replaced by another Syrian teacher. Also the wood-work instructor Hassan 'Assaf, retired after 8 years' service in Bahrain and his former colleague returned on a short contract in his place. The local teacher of English has been replaced by one of the recently appointed Egyptian teachers who devotes about two-thirds of his full-time service to the Technical School. In addition to the four foreign teachers in the school three workmen-instructors are employed in the shops, mainly on productive work but assisting occasionally in the teaching. Finance. Considered solely in relation to immediate results expenditure on the I echmcal School would appear extravagant. Working expenses for the year 1363 {i .e., the balance of non-capital expenditure over revenue) amounted to some Rs. 33.000 in return for the training of only 44 pupils. It should be noted, however, that the cost of the school during the past three years has been applied m effect to preparation for a much larger establishment than present restrictions would allow. In the matter of accommodation, staff, and to a certain extent equipment, the school is now ready to receive about40 roo boys. Staff salaries and allowances constitute about 88 per cent, of the working expenses of the school. This figure will remain abnormally high so long as the majority of the teachers come from abroad at considerable expense and have to be employed uneconomically in teaching very small classes and groups. Revenue from contract work carried out in the school workshops (to the approximate value of Rs. 4,000 during the year under review) does little more than compensate for the cost of materials used and the wages of employees, the latter including workmen-instructors and a variable number of ex-pupils in the capacity of probationer-workmen. The object of the commercial side of the work shop activities, however, is not so much to make profit as to influence instruction in the direction of real trade practice. General. Steady improvement in the teaching of class subjects is largely due to the encouraging efforts of the Head Teacher. Progress on the academic side is much limited by the rather poor standard of intelligence of most of the boys who offer themselves for technical training. Class lessons are confined to the subjects of practical mathematics, drawing, English and elementary trade technology, with the addition of Arabic and some general knowledge in the Preparatory Classes. Of the workshop activities woodwork is the least restricted by shortage of materials and more pupils are choosing woodwork as their trade, probably because of improved employment prospects. The largest contract carried out during the year was for the making of residential quarters furniture (to the value of Rs. 2,500) for the British Overseas Airways Corporation. On the mechanical and metalwork side it is more difficult to provide a sufficient range of work. A number of small fitting, turning and blacksmithing jobs from the Royal Naval Base and elsewhere have provided a useful variant from conventional exercises. The long overdue installation of welding equipment would increase enormously the usefulness of tfie engineering shop and extend the range of the pupils' experience. Workshop activity and games appear to have a beneficial effect on the growth and general health of the boys as they pass through the school. The prevalence of defective vision noticeably affects the standard of craftsmanship. While there have been few cases of serious illness among those who have attended the school for any considerable length of time, a number of new entrants left after a short attendance because they were physically unfit for sustained work. The school is indebted to the Education Department for extending to pupils and teachers many of its recreational and cultural facilities and for the use of the residential hostel by a number of Technical School boarders. MINORS' DEPARTMENT. {from the report of the Superintendent of the Minors' Department, Mr. Mohamed Dowaicer). The Department continued to deal with the affairs and the estates which were entrusted to its charge under the superintendence of a committee presided over by Shaikh Daij Shaikh Hamad and his deputy Shaikh Ali bin Khalifah bin Daij. This department which to a certain extent under takes duties similar to those of a Public I rustee is paid for from Government funds and at present no fees are charged for the administration of the estates which it controls. The annual cost to the Government is about Rs. 12,000, this represents the salaries of the Superintendent and the clerical staff, the members of the committee give their services freely. The department dealt with 14 new estates during the year which included the estates of the heirs of certain people who lost their lives in fatal accidents and whose heirs were compensated by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Distribution of compensation was carried out through the department.41 The collection of rents amounted toRs .44,600 about Rs. 12 ,000, more than in 1362, the increase was due to the higher rents obtained from gardens. It is proposed to increase all house rents by 10 per cent, from the beginning of 1364. Interest on loans amounted to Rs.8 ,500. Money is lent to the public against mortgages on property or on gold at a regular scale of interest. Though technically this is contrary to Islamic law yet it has the approval of the members of the committee who are leading Moslem merchants and notables. The practice of taking interest has always existed in Bahrain but to be within the strict letter of the law interest is not added to the loan but the equivalent of the interest is deducted in kind or in cash when the loan is paid to the borrower. Over Rs .17,000 was recovered from debtors who owed money to estates under the adminis tration of the department, in almost every case the recovery of these debts was effected without resort to the courts. The department paid Rs .37,700 in allowances to minors and disbursed Rs .68,800 to persons attaining their majority. Some repairs and alterations were made to the property of the late Haj Abdul Rehman Zayani and the house of the heirs of Abdu Ali bin Rajab was altered and made suitable for a school and let to the Government on satisfactory terms. Loans amounting to Rs. 1 ,27,500 were made during the year, this sum together with the sum outstanding, totalled Rs .2,10,900. RECEIPTS. EXPENDITURE. Rs. a. P- Rs. a.

Owing to the high price of Bahrain dates during the last two years many date gardens have changed hands at profitable prices to the sellers and the owners of gardens have been stimulated to take more interest in their property. It is estimated that during the 1363 planting season about 50,000 young date trees were put into Bahrain gardens, many of them on land where date palms had not previously been grown. Towns folk who used not to be interested in gardens have invested money in date gardens and this has contributed to the present abnormal land prices in Bahrain. More vegetables were grown during the year in response to the increased demand mostly from foreigners for both European and indigenous varieties. In the Berbar and Bilad al Qadim districts many garden owners planted vegetable instead of lucerne. Cabbages which used to be sold at Rs .4 per 100 were bought in the market at Rs .40 to Rs .50 per 100, tomatoes which before the war sold at about Rs .4 per maund were bought at Rs .48 per maund and turnips previously sold at Rs.1 -8 per maund fetched as much as Rs .14 per maund. The price of lucerne rose consider ably, this was due to the increased demand for milk and for fodder for livestock, lucerne is still the most profitable all round crop though the price of Bahrain lucerne seed, which is superior to imported seeds, is very high. In one garden at Muharraq Rs .20,000 was realised from the sale of melons grown from imported seed. Apart from dates very little fruit is produced in Bahrain, experiments have been made in growing a number of species but mostly without success. The salty soil and the presence of brackish water a few feet below the surface causes most fruit trees to die soon after they are planted but/ 42 grapes, limes and pawpaw are being cultivated with success. The Budeya Government garden produced a fine crop of grapes and grape cuttings from Budeya were planted out in many other gardens in different parts of Bahrain and were sent to the mainland. Little fresh fruit was imported from Persia so locally grown fruit sold at high prices. The price of animal manure rose during the year and many people collected guano fiom neighbouring islands for use in gardens. Guano was sold at about Rs.ioo for a small boat load. In some districts there was a decrease in the flow from artesian wells, owing to this garden owners paid more attention to irrigation channels and the quantity of stagnant water was reduced which had a beneficial effect on the anti-malaria campaign. At one time during the year, owing to the high price of meat, many cultivators sold the bulls which they used in their gardens for drawing water and some stock owners slaughtered milk cows. The Government took steps to prevent this waste of cattle. The Indian cattle which were purchased by the Government some years ago and which had not been altogether a success were sold to a local landowner. The restriction on the drilling of new artesian wells continued during the year though in one case permission was granted by the Government for boring a well at Malcheih where a number of gardens were perishing owing to lack of water, they depended upon a spring in the lulls some miles away and during the last few years the spring has become dry. PASSPORT DEPARTMENT. {From the report by Mr. Ibrahaim Khalfan, Passport Officer.) The revenue from passports was Rs. 13,800, in the previous year it was Rs .8 ,Soo. Book passports, of which the stock had become exhausted, were received in the Spring and large numbers of these were applied for principally by Shias proposing to make the Pilgrimage to the Holy Cities in Iraq. The prosperity in Bahrain made it possible for many people to afford this journey in spite of the new regulation necessitating a cash deposit from persons travelling to Iraq for the pilgrimage. Not all the people who took out book passports used them during the year but the majority of them planned to travel early in 1364. Though the number of Shias contemplating the Pilgrimage to Iraq increased yet there was no similar increase in the number of pilgrims to Mecca. Only one large party, including Shaikh Ali bin Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa, did the Haj. During recent years there has been a steady falling off in the number of Mecca pilgrims from Bahrain. This apparent lack of enthusiasm for one of the fundamental duties of a Moslem is not on account of increased difficulties in travelling to Mecca because many people who could not formerly afford to do so are now in a position to bear the cost and for some years the existence of motor transport has made the journey shorter and easier. It is a symptom of the times in Bahrain that religious observances are being lightly regarded by the younger generation of Bahrain Arabs. The following numbers of passengers landed at Bahrain :— By sea (native craft) ,. .. • • • • I 5»365 By sea (steamers) 3'739 By air .. .. .. •• •• •• 1^58 Total .. 20,962 During the year 890 ' gratis ' passports were issued to members of the Ruling Family, students and the Nairn tribe. Owing to the shortage of labour in Bahrain the Bahrain Government gave special facilities for the landing of Persians from the Persian coast who were enlisted as labourers by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. During the last four months of the year almost 1,000 Persians of this type landed in Bahrain, out of this number 207 returned to Persia, 40 were waiting at the end of the year for boats to take them back to their country and 54 left their employment and have not been traced.43 It is probable that they are working elsewhere in Bahrain or on the mainland. 1 hese 1 'ersians, though good workmen, are a type whose presence in Bahrain is not desirable. A round-up of un employed persons was made by the Police towards the end of the year but only a few of the foreign Persian labourers were found. The Passport Department working in co-operation with the Food Control verified the claims of all persons who applied for ration cards on the score of having entered Bahrain since the rationing system was introduced, the Department also supplied details of people leaving Bahrain in order that their names should be cancelled on the ration register. During the last five months of the year over 700 persons from Qatar were registered as having entered Bahrain owing to the removal of the ban upon Qatar subjects coming into the country. The number of Qataris who have actually entered Bahrain is undoubtedly very much greater than the number of arrivals which were registered. These people land on the coast or on small islands at night and join their relations at Hedd or in Muharraq or in the villages on the south east coast of Bahrain where their presence is not detected. Numbers of Qatar Arabs obtained work with the Bahrain Petroleum Company, declaring themselves to be Bahrain subjects. 1 here is reason to believe that the Qataris wish to settle permanently in Bahrain as in many cases they brought with them their families and livestock. Destitute Persians continued to enter Bahrain without permission. During the year 42 men of this type were arrested and some were sent to work on the oil fields and others were repatiiated. The number of men who were caught is probably small in proportion to the number who evaded the authorities. Though during the year there was ample work to provide employment for all Bahrain subjects and for foreigners as well yet when conditions become normal, after the war there may be unemployment which will be aggravated by an increase in the numbers of men who do not specialise in any trade but are useful only as coolies. During the year 36 persons acquired Bahrain Nationality including one Iraqian and one Abyssinian. The majority of the naturalised Bahrain subjects are Persians who have lived and traded for many years in Bahrain and who have severed their connection with their native country. Only people who have lived not less than 10 years in Bahrain and who own property are eligible for Bahrain nationality. The conditions under which people can obtain Saudi-Arabia nationality are apparently less strict as cases have been noted in which people with no connection with that country have visited a Saudi-Arabian port for a few days or weeks and have then returned with Saudi-Arabian passports. FOOD CONTROL DEPARTMENT. (Report by Mr. G. W. R. Smith, Director oj Customs and Food Controller, Bahrain). The problem of providing suitable and sufficient food for the people of Bahrain was once again one of the main preoccupations of the Government and during the year under review, in attaining this object, some 84 lacs of rupees were spent by the Government on the purchase of such essential foods as wheat, flour, barley, rice, sugar and dates, about 7 lacs was spent on buying tea and 62 lacs upon piecegoods. The quantity of rice purchased was however only just over 400 tons, it was of Iraq origin and for the majority of people wheat formed the staple diet throughout the year. Despite the lack of rice in any quantity there were no signs of malnutrition amongst the people and there was a considerable decrease in the number of cases of Bacillary Dysentcr} which many people had previously attributed to the change in diet. The system of Food distribution which commenced during 1363, continued unchanged through out the year and there were few complaints from the public against the shop-keepers.44 The monthly cereal ration for an adult was maintained at 20 lbs. throughout the year ; but the proportions of different cereals varied at times, for example, at the beginning of the year, the ration was made up of 12 lbs. wheat, and 4 lbs. each of No. 1 flour and barley, in Jamad-al-Awal, and for the three ensuing months, the ration consisted of 10 lbs. wheat, 7 lbs. mixed flour and 3 lbs. of rice, commencing in Ramadhan and until the end of the year the ration was made up of 12 lbs. of wheat and 8 lbs. of mixed flour. During the pearl diving season the crews were also issued with a ration of Jareesh (crushed wheat) and an unlimited supply of dates and date juice. At the beginning of the year up to the end of Shaaban the sugar ration was 2 J lbs. per adult for those living in the towns, and ^ lb. per adult in the villages from Kamadhan and until the end of the year the ration was increased to 3 lbs. per adult in the towns and 1 lb. per adult in the villages. The reason for the difference in the rations, between the townsfolk, and the villagers is that in the towns there are large non-Arab communities who consume large quantities of sugar whilst the villagers normally scarcely consume any sugar. It became possible to increase the sugar ration when an additional quota of sugar was allowed from India for the purpose of barter, previously a certain amount of sugar had to be set aside for sale to Persians importing barter goods such as meat. Tea was very short supply for the first half of the year and in order to ensure a fair distribution it was found necessary to open Government Tea shops, staffed by Government employees and to issue an equal ration to all. Just before Ramadhan Bahrain's 1943-1944 quota of tea arrived and from then onwards the position was easier and the public were able to purchase their requirements from the same shops from which they purchase their cereals. During the month of Shaaban there were many complaints from the public against the local butchers for refusing to sell meat at controlled prices and for withholding livestock from the market. At a special meeting of the Food Control Committee called for the purpose of discussing ways and means of combating this practice, it was decided the best method would be for the Government, through the medium of the Municipality, to purchase all imports of livestock and to sell slaughtered meat in the meat markets direct to the public. For this purpose salaried butchers were engaged and since then there have been no complaints. Towards the end of the year under review there was a distinct falling off in the quantity of imports, and it was found necessary in order to conserve stocks, to slaughter and sell meat to the public on four days a week only. The barter system, whereby Nakhudas importing such commodities as livestock, ghee, firewood, potatoes, etc., were allowed to export tea and sugar in similar value, worked well and there was a plentiful supply of most of these commodities, at reasonable prices, available throughout the year. The Government continued to purchase one-third of various types of Indian cotton piecegoods to sell by the yard at 5 per cent, over cost to poor people. The cost of living in Bahrain rose again during the year, prices, especially those of piecegoods, reaching peak heights as will be seen from the comparison of prices. A very strict control was again exercised on the export of all types of goods from Bahrain. Many arrests were made by both the Police and by Customs officials in cases of attempted smuggling of sugar and piecegoods. The general increase in wages due to the great demand for labour became an incentive to profiteering and hoarding as many people preferred to pay high prices for what they needed rather than report the profiteer to the authorities. Those cases which were reported were all successfully prosecuted. Due to a considerable increase in staff and to relieve congestion towards the end of the year the Food Control Department removed to new premises which provided better facilities for the public to obtain their piecegoods rations and for approved shopkeepers to purchase their food supplies.FOODSTUFFS AND COMMODITIES.

Report by Group Captain H. P. G. Leigh, State Engineer. Electricity Department. The Electricity Undertaking operated continuously during the year. Group Captain H. P.-G. Leigh, A. M. I. Mech. E., Chartered Mechanical Engineer, A.F.R.Ae. S. assumed the duties of State Engineer with effect from November 2nd, 1944. Units generated for the year 1363 showed an increase of 406,643 over 1362. Units sold for the year 1363 showed an increase of 319,311 over 1362. New Load— Extra load connected during the year amounted to 314.5 K.W. The nature of the new load was as follows :— Lighting and Fans 142.000 K.W. Power—Motors, etc»... .. .. .. .. .. 49.500 „ A. C. Units 122.000 „ Refrigerators 1.000 „ The bulk of this additional load was allocated to the R.A.F., who added 231.5 K.W. to their connected load at the end of 1362, and to the new Royal Naval Transmitting Station which has a connected load of approximately 35 K.W, The remainder was allocated to the usual domestic load increases in the Towns of Manamah and Muharraq. Revenue.— Revenue from units sold during 1363 amounts to Rs. 2,15,721-5-0 as compared with Rs. 1,62,356-6-0 in 1362, an increase of Rs. 53,364-15-0. This increase was due chiefly to R.A.F. and Naval additional power requirements. New Consumers.— 74 new consumers were connected during 1363 :— In Manamah .. .. .. 56 In Muharraq .. .. .. 18 Total consumers connected at the end of 1363—1,812. Maximum load recorded .. .. 308 K.W. Total kilowatts connected at the end of 1363 was 1092.500 K.W. The Power House generating plant capacity is at present 400 K.W., and each individual set is in bad mechanical condition. This is the result of long life and inefficient maintenance. An additional contributory factor has been the non-availability of adequate reserve generating capacity. Wiring Contractors.— The wiring of houses by local contractors continued, 293 points being wired during 1363 as compared with 237 points in 1362. Premises wired by the registered contractors were as follows :— Haji Salman Abdulla Zayani .. .. .. .. 14 premises. Mr. Yousif Khalil Al-Moayed .. .. .. .. 23 ,, Messrs. Koohiji Bros. .. .. .. .. . 22 ,, The Roj^al Navy carried out the wiring of the following during 1363 :— 1. The New Transmitting Station which has a connected load of approximately 35 K.W. 2. Additional machinery in the Workshops, i.e. (а) 1—5 H.P. Bandsaw. (б) 1—3 H.P. Grinder. (c) 1—if H.P. Drilling machine. 3. Regulating Office for 5 light points and 2 fan points. 4. Theatre for 106 light points and 3 plugs. 5. One 40 cubic feet refrigerator. 6. One cold storage plant.49 The additional wiring in the R.A.F. Muharraq Camp was carried out by the R.A.F. The R.A.F. also wired during 1363 the British Overseas Airways Corporation Rest House ( third floor ) for 48 light points and 15 fan points. The Electricity Department carried out the wiring of Govern ment and certain other premises as follows:— 1. New Food Control Office. 2. Government Hospital—additional wiring. 3. The Agency and A.P.A.'s house—additional wiring. 4. Muharraq Girls' School—additional wiring. 5. The Adviserate—additional wiring. 6. The State Engineer's Office—additional wiring. 7. Ebrahim bin Butti's Workshop in Muharraq—a three phase supply for lathe, etc. Also other minor additions in various other premises. Main Extensions.— Two main extensions were carried out during the year 1363, as follows: (1) A High-tension overhead line to the Tank Installation of the R.A.F. on Muharraq Island with a 30 KVA transformer—Material provided by the R.A.F. (2) A High-tension line to the new Transmitting Station of the Royal Navy with a 50 KVA transformer—Material provided by the Royal Navy. Air Conditioning.— About 45 A.C. units were in operation in 1363. At the end of 1363 the R.A.F. had a connected load of 122 K.W. for air conditioning only on their Muharraq Camp. The load would have increased but for the difficulty of obtaining A.C. plant. Continuity of Supply.— The Electricity Undertaking has been in operation since May, 1930, and during the months of Dilquada and Dilhaja, 1363 (November-December, 1944) when weather con ditions were bad owing to heavy rain and winds there were 166 power distribution failures, all external. It is apparent that inefficient inspection and maintenance was an additional contributory factor to these failures. The general condition of the power distribution standards is very bad owing to excessive corrosion and a large percentage are badly holed. Several have been found to have become unsafe and a few have been replaced, but owing to the non-availability of a sufficient quantit} of spares it has not been possible to undertake a general replacement. Temporary repairs are being made by encasing the lower extremities of the standards in a concrete column when the damage is limited to such parts. In other cases steel collar clamps are bolted in position to reinforce the damaged area. The early replacement of a large percentage of the standards is an essential requirement, particularly those in close proximity to the sea in Manamah and along the causeway to the Shaikh Hamad Bridge. Reduction of the diameter of the feeders owing to corrosion has been checked and found to be of an average order of 10 per cent. In view of the fact that no major replacements ha\e been made since the original installation 14 years ago this is considered to be a normal condition under the pre vailing climatic conditions. Cross arm brackets and other ferrous clamps and fittings however require constant replacement as the result of excessive corrosion and insufficient protecth e co\ ering. This has been inevitable owing to the short supplies of suitable paint during the past five vears. No. 1 Generating Set of 100 K.W. capacity was out of service for a period of seven weeks during the months of November 1944 and January 1945 owing to a defective air compressor for which no spares were available. Eventually, repairs requiring the use of machine tools were kindly carried out by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Owing to this failure the R.A.F. were required to run their own standby generators and the disconnection of one or two section feeders had to be arranged daily in order that the usual mainte nance of the other two generating sets could be carried out.50 Oil Filtration Plant.— Owing to the breakdown of the De Laval filter and its insufficient capacity to cater for the three existing generating sets it has been decided to instal a Steam Line Filter of 2.5 gallons per hour capacity. An order has been placed with the Company concerned and it is expected that supply will be effected during the early part of 1364. It is considered that the cost of this important equipment will be amply repaid by a more economical consumption of lubricating oil and also by increased mechanical efficiency of the engines from the use of cleansed oil. Financial Position.— After meeting all charges a surplus of Rs. 63,479 was shown for the year 1363, which has been carried to ' OPERATING RESERVE.' Electricity Charges.— Electricity charges were not increased in 1363, and it appears that there will be no necessity at the present stage to anticipate increased generating costs. Prospects for 1364.— (1) R.A.F. Muharraq expect to carry out the installation in the near future of four generating sets giving a total output of approximately 400 K.W. No definite arrangements have yet been made regarding the release of the whole or even part of the existing connected load of 246.500 K.W. but it is anticipated that their ultimate requirements will be an emergency supply only. This matter is now under consideration. 2. (a) B.O.A.C. The prevision of an H. T. feeder and transformer for supplying the Tran sient Camp has been arranged. The necessary wiring of the Camp itself will be carried out by the R.A.F. (A.M.W.D. Dept.) The additional connected load is expected to be of the order of approx imately 10.00 K.W. (6) An additional power supply requirement for new buildings on the Jetty will entail the provision of an increase in the supply capacity. Non-availability of the essential materials has delayed the commencement of this work which requires two L. I. lines from a transformer in the Gudhaibia Palace to a point approximately 400 yards distant and onwards four L. I. lines carried on seven steel standards to the Jetty, approximately a further 600 yards. An arrangement has been made for the supply of the necessary materials from R.A.F. sources and the work will be carried out by the Electricity Department as soon as this is available. {c) Air Conditioning of the B.O.A.C. Rest House.— -It has been notified by B.O.A.C. that they expect to instal air conditioning units in the Rest House during the summer of 1945 requiring a power supply of approximately 55 K .W. An application for this supply has been carefully considered and it has not been found possible to guarantee it even after the installation of the new 200 K.W generating set. If however the proposed installation of a 400 K.W. generating capacity is effected by the R.A.F. and thereby reduces the present connected load to Muharraq, it will be possible to supply the additional B.O.A.C. requirements. This matter is being given urgent consideration and will be reviewed in conjunction with the R.A.F. authorities. 3. The new 200 K.W., M.B. &amp; D. generating set on order from the United Kingdom is expected to arrive and be erected during the first six months of 1945 (1364)- It is hoped that it will be available for load during the summer of 1364. This will not immediately materially affect the existing generat ing capacity as the two 100 K.W. sets will require to be temporarily taken out of service for complete overhaul. 4. The usual domestic load increases in the bazaars and towns generally should add approx imately 40 K.W. New Flour Mills.— The State Engineer's Department installed two new plants of Indian manufacture, electrically operated between November and December, 1944. The average output capacity per mill for eleven hours running is 50 sacks each of three maunds. Fitting and Electrical Workshops— The provision of suitable workshop facilities in the State Engineer's Department is clearly a long standing and urgent requirement.51 Considering the amount of machinery, Mechanical Transport, and Electrical and Mechanical equipment which requires to be efficiently maintained, it is apparent that such work has in the past been done in a most unsatisfactory and expensive manner through being put out to various local workshops where poor equipment and a low standard of workmanship has produced inefficient repairs. In view of this, arrangements have been made to provide a Fitting Shop in the vicinity of the Power House and an Electrical Shop in the Building of the Electricity Department. The work is well in hand and certain hand tools, benches, and associated equipment has been provided from local sources. Other essential machine tools and equipment, it is hoped, will be made available by the Ministry of Supply in England (Machine Tool Control) and the necessary enquiries for their provision have been made. When the Workshops are available it will be possible to carry out more expeditiously and economically all essential repairs to the generating plant and other equipment associated with Mechanical Transport, Flour Mills, Water systems and Hospital Appliances. Also electrical equipment such as motors, fans, refrigerators, air conditioning units, etc. It is hoped that further material advantage will accrue from the raising of the standard of skill of the mechanics as a result of practical experience and the use of proper tools on repair work. The present general standard of skill of most of the mechanics of the Department is very low. Telephone Department.— The number of subscribers connected at the end of 1363 was 104. The new 50 line switchboard ordered in 1943 (1362) arrived during 1363 and is in use. The total capacity of the exchange is 150 lines. Enquiries are now being made by Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited, Bahrain, in connection with a proposal to supply a fully automatic system in substitution of the present manually operated one. It is considered that the installation of an automatic system would prove to be extremely beneficial to all subscribers and would eliminate the numerous unsatis factory factors to which the present system is subject such as exchange delays, crossed lines, unclear reception, etc. Applications for additional connections have had to be refused owing to the difficulty in obtaining new telephone instruments, wire, etc. This Department was self supporting during the year 1363. Transport Department.— The Government Garage carried out the repairing and servicing of all Government vehicles (27) during 1363. Great difficulty has been experienced in keeping vehicles on the road owing to spare parts not being available locally or obtainable from Overseas. The Government of India, through the Political Agent, Bahrain, has again been of great assistance in the matter of tyres. Another quota was allotted to Bahrain, otherwise Government and essential public vehicles would have come to a standstill. As before, the distribution of these tyres is controlled by the State Engineer's Department. All enquiries and efforts to obtain new vehicles for use of the Government officials have as yet been without success. With a view to effecting an improvement in the standard of maintenance and repair of mechanical transport vehicles, the personnel have been divided into separate gangs for repair and servicing. Three repair gangs, each consisting of one fitter, one fitter's mate and one coolie, have been formed and issued with an up-to-date kit of essential hand tools. Each gang works as an individual unit and is allotted work as requisite. The servicing gang consisting of one fitter's mate and one coolie, assisted by the driver of the vehicle concerned carries out the normal servicing routine of every vehicle once in every 14 days. It has been found that this period is a more suitable guide than mileage owing to the peculiar weather and climatic conditions prevailing.52 Additional repair facilities have been made available by the provision of a small painting shop, also a carpenter's shop. So far only the hand painting of vehicles has been possible but it is hoped to utilise a paint spraying plant when a supply of suitable Cellulose base paints can be made. I he lack of painting facilities has in the past been a contributory factor to the rapid wear of M. T. equip ment, body work, etc., as deterioration resulting from corrosion is excessively high in Bahrain. Fire Section.— The Government and Municipal Fire Engines extinguished twelve fires during 1363 —No major outbreaks occurred. Traffic Section.— The State Engineer's Department continued to carry out the registration of all motor vehicles in the State, testing of brakes, lights, etc. (in accordance with the Bahrain Govern ment Motor Vehicle Proclamation of 1357). The licensing and re-licensing of all drivers was also carried out by this Department, 641 drivers being examined during 1363, out of which 447 passed. The number of licenses issued during the year was 699. The number of motor vehicles now in use in the State was registered at the end of 1363 as 529, including those of the Bahrain Petroleum Company but excluding all vehicles belonging to H. M. Forces. It is expected that some new vehicles will be imported during 1364 which would relieve the present difficulties due to insufficiency of road transport facilities. Four vehicles were withdrawn from service by the State Engineer during 1363 owing to their very bad mechanical condition which made them non-roadworthy. No spares could be obtained for their repair from normal sources and even had such spares been available it would not have been an economical proposition to have used them on such old vehicles. They were eventually put up for sale by tender and a price of Rs. 10,100 was finally accepted. The offer of such a sum of money which is excessively beyond the true or economic value indicates that spare parts have been conserved by some dealers and are being retailed at fabulous prices in the black market. The issue of car batteries at controlled prices was continued during 1363, as in the case of tyres, firsth' to essential vehicles. Shaikh Hamad Bridge— Shaikh Hamad Bridge continued to operate successfully during 1363. Total revenue amounted to Rs. 66,260-6-0. Operating costs, etc. including all charges and depreciation for three years (1361-1363) amounted to Rs. 35,209-13-1 leaving a surplus of Rs. 31,050-8-11. General. Water Scheme.— The Municipal Water Scheme is still held in abeyance owing to the war. Until this is carried out including suitable draining, the breeding of mosquitoes and consequent high percentage of malaria will continue in the Manamah City Area. New Artesian Well for the Power House.— For some time it has been evident that the casing of the supply well is defective, allowing silt to enter the engines with the cooling water. After consultation with the Bahrain Petroleum Company, it has been decided to drill a new well and when completed to plug the existing one. This work will be carried out in 1364. Staff.— Since the Department was started in 1349 every effort has been made to train Bahrainians in the work of the various sections, but generally speaking they do not seem to acquire the skill of hand which is required for the efficient maintenance of mechanical equipment. When the machinery and tools for the new fitting shop become available, it is hoped to give additional training by employing each mechanic in turn for a short period on repair work requiring the use of both hand and machine tools. This work will be supervised by a competent mechanic. The Department has 100 employees of all classes out of which only six are foreigners (British subjects).Statement of Energy connected, sold, etc., for the year ending Total energy generated in kilo watt hours.

Report by Mr . G. W. R. Smith, The Director of Customs and Port Officer. The revenue collected by the Customs Department from all sources, including boat licences, exceeded last year's revenue by Rs. 6,50,726, and exceeded the amount which was anticipated in the budget by Rs. 11 ,60,837. The increased revenue was brought about by [a) Peak Prices being reached for most commod ities, (6) the steady arrival of quota goods from India, some of which were for 1362, and (c) the astonish ing success of the barter system, resulting in prolific imports of barter earning products. 1363 : Actual Receipts, compared with Budget Estimates.

The engine was totally destroyed by fire and the hull was partly destroyed. The hull was later repaired and fitted with a new engine and returned to service. The Light Tender ' NEARCHUS ' paid her usual visits of inspection to the Harbour Lighting. General. Whilst anticipating another successful year as regards Customs revenue the budget estimates for the ensuing year have been shown at approximately 25 per cent, lower than in 1363, as all signs point to a general fall in prices, particularly those of piece-goods from India—due to the much stricter control prevailing there over Export prices. OLD GAUGING AND INSPECTION. Report by Mr . G. E. Hutchings. Observations carried out by the Government in the works of the Bahrain Petroleum Company were as follows :— 1. Day to day measurement and sampling of crude oil, {a) gathered from the Bahrain Field, (6) imported from Arabia via the Zellaq terminal. 2. Inspection of measuring and distributing equipment used in connection with petroleum products consumed in Bharain, in respect of which royalty payment is deducted. 3. Inspection (in the capacity of an independent party) of cargoes of refined petroleum, such inspection including :— {a) Witness of shore tank gauges of quantity. (b) Certification of laboratory tests. (c) Certification of ships' loading data. 4. Inspection of loaded containers used for the export of manufactured gas. 5. Witness of shore tank gauges of quantity of air-craft fuel imported to Bahrain and stored in the Company's tanks. This work was carried out under the supervision of Mr. W. B. Steele, the State Engineer, until his departure from Bahrain at midsummer, and subsequently by Mr. G. E. Hutchings, Principal of the Technical School. Three trained native gangers were employed by the Government at the Zellaq coast terminal to work in conjunction with the Company's staff on imported crude oil measure ment. The Government's royalty measurements of crude oil at the refinery receiving tanks were made by a senior officer of the Company seconded to the Government for that service. This is a temporary arrangement made necessary by staff shortage and will terminate as soon as it is possible to appoint a Government officer for all the petroleum inspection work. All inspections other than for royalty purposes have been conducted personally by Mr. Steele and his successor. The cost of the whole of thi? service, including salaries, transport and office expenses, amounted during the year to Rs. 19,364. Fees paid to the Government through the Bahrain Petroleum Company in respect of cargo inspections amounted to Rs.28,708, giving a credit balance of Rs. 9.344- Shippings Bills. The total number of Shipping Bills dealt as follows:— Export Shipping Bills .. Direct Transhipment Over-carried cargo Total ..63 LOCAL INDUSTRIES. Boat Building. Apart from diving Bahrain possesses few local industries but boat building used at one time to be a profitable trade which provided employment for a certain number of skilled shipwrights and their apprentices and workmen. With the decrease in the number of diving dhows the boat building business declined and three or four years ago there were numbers of hulls of big sailing dhows laid up in the shipyards at Naim and at Muharraq awaiting purchasers. After the war had been going on for some time Bahrain merchants realised that there were big profits to be made by carrying cargoes in sailing dhows from India to the Persian Gulf ports and to Basra. The boats which had been built as a speculation and which had laid idle on shore for many years, in some cases so long that trees had grown around them, were sold for good prices, when no new boats remained old hulls were reconditioned and decked in and all the available teakwood was used. Local boat owners began to sell their craft to buyers from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia until the Government prohibited the export of Bahrain boats in order that the pearl fleet should not be depleted. The restrictions which were imposed on the export of timber from India seriously affected the boat building trade, the lack of timber, principally teak, prevented the building of new boats for which there would have been a ready sale if the boats had been available. The price of boats, both large and small, rose steadily during the last two years and small jolly boats, suitable for crossing to the mainland or carrying coral stone, which is cut from the bed of the sea at low tide, were sold for prices from 300 per cent, to 400 per cent, above pre-war prices, but unfortunately the building of new boats is now restricted owing to lack of timber. Weaving. The Shia Bahama living in a group of villages in the neighbourhood of Budeya, where there is little date cultivation, have for many generations been engaged in weaving sail-cloth and black shawls which are worn by the Bahama women. The work is done on primitive hand-looms which are made entirely of wood. Cotton yarn is used and this and some of the dyes are imported from India. Other dyes are made locally from vegetable and mineral sources. A little wool is woven for making into bishts but most of the work is cotton. Before the war the weaving industry was at a low ebb, there was not much demand for sail-cloth and locally made cotton stuffs were un saleable owing to the competition from cheap Japanese piece-goods which flooded the markets. As the war went on the stocks of Japanese piece-goods were sold out or found their way to the Black Market where they fetched high prices. The weavers made the most of their opportunity. In addition to making sail-cloth they produced new types of material which were used as head cloths, waist cloths and for women's clothes. They introduced new patterns and colours into their work and they are busier and more prosperous today than they have been for many years. In every village the number of hand-looms has increased and the shops in the bazaars display a variety of locally made cotton goods which in spite of the high cost of yarn compare favourably in price with the Indian materials. Sail-cloth made in Bahrain is in great demand in Saudi Arabia, where it is used for making tents and if production was increased locally woven goods from Bahrain would find a ready market outside the State, as long as the present conditions continue. If in the future the bazaars are again flooded with Japanese piece-goods then this small industry will fade away, it would not be so greatly affected by textiles from Britain or from India as these are of a different grade to the local products. Metal Workers. The lack of imported manufactured tin-ware has given an impetus to the local tin-smiths who are now producing a variety of utensils made from petrol tins, whose price is about six times what it was before the war, and from scrap metal from parts of aeroplanes. Garden implements, nails and rough tools have always been made in Bahrain. In the past blacksmiths used charcoal in their forges. Charcoal as well as firewood, which is imported from Persia, is now extremely expensive and partly owing to this the local blacksmiths have taken to using oil-coke, a product which is produced by the Bahrain Petroleum Company, which is cheap and as effective as charcoal.64 GENERAL. Presentation of a Sword to His Highness. A Naval sword was presented to His Highness by the Royal Navy. The presentation was made by the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, Commodore J. M. Howson, at the Naval Base at Jufair. Muharram Celebrations. Many more Shias than usual took part in the Muharram celebrations, culminating in the procession on the tenth day of Muharram. Though the procession was unusually large and there were many more spectators than in previous years of all creeds and nationalities no incidents occurred. Bahrain is now one of the few places where this procession is allowed and Shias from the mainland visit Bahrain in order to participate in it. British Officials. Mr. W. B. Steele, who held the post of State Engineer since 1931, retired during the year. Mr. W. B. Steele who formerly belonged to Messrs. Callender's Cable and Construction Company came originally to Bahrain when the electric scheme was installed in Muharraq. In addition to dealing with the electric undertaking Mr. W. B. Steele was responsible for transport, car licensing and certain public works and for some years he carried out the work of oil gauging. Group Captain H. P. G. Leigh was appointed State Engineer on a two years' contract and commenced his duties in December, 1944. Mr. G. E. Hutchings, Principal of the Technical School, took over the work of oil gauging besides his duties as Principal of the Technical School. Miss N. M. Harbottle, Matron of the Government Hospital, resigned during the summer. Miss D. Ellson and Miss R. G. A. Maguire came out from England to join the staff of the Government Hospital as Nursing Sisters. ' A1 Bahrain '. The local weekly newspaper, ' A1 Bahrain ', went out of circulation during the year. Superintendent, Public Works Department. Mr. Mohamed Jafar, Superintendent, Public Works Department, received the title of Khan Sahib in the Birthday Honours. Floods. During the summer abnormal high tides caused serious floods on the island of Muharraq, which is only a few feet above sea level. The town of Hedd was isolated and part of the aerodrome was affected. At other places down the coast the tide came inshore and covered areas which have never been submerged before. Zubara. An agreement was made and signed by the rulers of Bahrain and Qatar about the disputed Zubara area on the Qatar coast but as far as Bahrain was concerned the agreement led to no change in the situation. The Heir-Apparent of the Qatar Shaikh came twice to Bahrain for medical treatment and large numbers of Qatar subjects entered Bahrain, mostly without permission, and obtained work in Bahrain. Qatar continued to be a market for goods which were smuggled out of Bahrain. Obituary. The death occurred during the year of Haj Sulman bin Matar, one of the leading pearl merchants of Muharraq, who was well known for his philanthropic deeds. For several years he provided food for large numbers of poor people who were daily fed at his doors. He sat on various councils and committees and was a valuable member of the community.67 BUDGET—1364. In the Budget for 1364 it is estimated that the revenue will amount to 48 lakhs and the expen diture will be 38 lakhs, the surplus of revenue over expenditure, 10 lakhs, will be added to the Reserve Fund, On the revenue side of the Budget 27 lakhs will be derived from the oil royalty which it is assumed will produce approximately the same as in 1363. Customs revenue is assessed at Rs. 15,60,000. This is 5 lakhs less than the actuals of 1363 but there is reason to suppose that there may be a decrease in the value of imports which would reduce the customs collections. Interest from the Reserve I und now amounts to Rs ,3,20,000. The remaining sources of income amounting together to Rs. 3,20,000 are estimated at slightly less than last year's actuals. 1 he estimated expenditure is 5 lakhs higher than the actual expenditure during the previous year. No provision has been made for any new schemes or expansion. Over one third of the total expenditure goes in the (ivil List and the proportion of the oil royalty which is paid to the Ruling 1 amily the remainder consists almost entirely of salaries which are paid to employees who are working in Go\ eminent departments, in the armed forces, and in social services such as Education and Public Health. Higher rates of pay and higher war allowances have increased the cost of the administration in e\ ery direction most especially in the case of the Police and Nature forces. In 1363 the cost of Public Protection was Rs .5,71,000. In the 1364 Budget 8 lakhs has been allocated to this heading which includes half a lakh to provide for a detachment of British Police whom it is hoped may be enlisted for duty in Bahrain. 1 he estimated cost of Education is one lakh higher than the actual cost in 1363, much of the increase is to cover the salaries of a number of Egyptian teachers who started working at the beginning of the year. The Budget of the Electric Supply Department has been shown with the State Budget. A profit of Rs. 27,000 is anticipated. The Bahrain Government has invested in this undertaking just under 5 lakhs and until now there has been no return for this investment.
