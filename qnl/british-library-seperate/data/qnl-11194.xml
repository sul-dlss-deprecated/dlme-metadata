The Welby Commission proposed a principle of equal division, which was put into practice from 1900 onwards. In 1917 the issue of Persian charges was re-examined in relation to the costs of the South Persia Rifles and the Seistan Levy Corps respectively (the cost of the former was divided equally, whilst the latter was deemed chargeable to Imperial revenues).The note goes on to cite other cases that have recently required consideration: relief measures in Persia and the construction of the Bunder Abbas-Kerman road and telegraph line. In both cases the Secretary of State in Council proposed that the expenses be divided equally.The note concludes with a quotation from a note recorded by the former Secretary of State for India [Joseph Austen Chamberlain] on 22 June 1916, accepting the principle of half charges.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Political and Secret Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>South Persia Rifles</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commission on Indian Expenditure</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Seistan Levy Corps</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Expenditure</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00017e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
