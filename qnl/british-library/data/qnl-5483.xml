Mr. Jassim bin Mohammad (a Kuwaiti by nationality) the Residency Agent, Sharjah, does not wish to serve either the Government of India or the Government of Pakistan, and in these circum stances it is difficult for him to continue on deputation from the Government of India. The question, therefore, of his retirement on proportionate pension arises, but I have not put up the case to * u s {&gt; mju / ( the Government of India pending reference to you. 3. Mr. Jassim bin Mohammad fills the post of the Residency Agent with full satisfaction, and I think his services should be retained. He, himself, wishes to serve H.M.G. and I should be grateful, therefore, if you would let me know whether, after he had retired, H.M.G. would be prepared to offer him a contract on terms and conditions similar to those he now enjoys, excluding deputation allowance. This would be preferable to his^serving in a temporary capacity. I make this suggestion because the work on Trucial Coast is complicated and it is highly desir^able for us to maintain continuity.

In view of his good service for the past 6 years I strongly recommend the grant to him of an increase in pay of Rs.30/- per mensem. Arab munshis are now in great demand with the military and other authorities and very hard to come by. Should Mr. Ali al Usaimi resign it would probably be very difficult to find a satisfactory replacement except at a much aigher roite of pay. 4.

In former years travelling on the Trucial Coast was performed by means of sea transport, launch or dhow, or by caravan. Conditions have now altered and owing to the greater security which prevails it is now possible to tour the Coast by motor transport, which is both quicker and more certain than by sea, travel by v/hich is often affected by weather conditions. Owing to the opening up of the Trucial Coast by reason of the Air Route, and of oil developments, the Residency Agent has considerably more touring to do than formerly, and it is essential that he should do this touring as expeditiously as possible. Though there are a few private care - the property of the local Shaikhs - there are no cars for hire on the Trucial Coast, ana the Residency Agent, therefore, has had to purchase a car and use it continuously in the public interests on ENCiosu.r '• official duty. I 'DIA FOREiGN SECRETARY'S j letter No. 7 J Af| * Dated 19 f v ' 1 irc'r'cd * IS 3. /3. The Residency .Agent, however, under prevailing rates of travelling allowance e.g. 4 annas a mile, is unable to maintain his car without financial loss. There are no proper n§/0|d3 on the Trucial Coast but only the roughest of tracks which are especially hard on tyres, and travel over which considerably reduces the life of a car as compared with travel over ordinary roads. There axe no garages or repair services of any sort on the Trucial Coast, which necessitates the maintenance by the Residency ^gent of a first class chauffeur-mechanic to keep his car in order and this individual, having to work in an isolated uncomfortable area with a bad climate, has to be paid at a specially high rate. Lastly, spare parts are naturally expensive. 4. To sum up. It is absolutely necessary for the Residency /gent to maintain a car in order to perform his public duties but at the present rate of travelling allowance the maintenance of this car involves him in financial loss. I, therefore, strongly recommend that the present travelling allowance be increased from annas 4 to annas 8 per mile, and would be grateful for an early reply.

Khan Bahadur ’Isa has since died and after consultation with Colonel Loch, I have decided th^t it would now be preferable to appoint as Residency Agent, Sharjah, Khan Sanib Saiyid Abdur Razzaq, the present Head Munshi, Bahrain, who has done excellent work there and who, I think, will fill uie post satisfactorily. 4. I propose changing the nature of the post from one on the fixed rate of pay to one on the time scale. The details are given in the attached proposition statement, from which it will be observed that no extra cost to Goverrment is inxait involved. 5. The reasons for the pr posed change in the nature of the post are that the fixed rale of pay was granted speci lly for Khan Bahadur ’Isa and it is desirable that future incumbents of the post should start on a time scale as is the case vith all other posts in the Persian Gulf Cadre. 6. It is necessary on various grounds that Khan Sahib dai/id Abdur Razzaq should enter on his new duties as soon as possible, and, if the Government of India approve of my proposal, 1 would be grateful for a reply by telegram.

I have the honour to inform you that the Auditors have raised a question concerning the payment from Air Force funds, of a grant of Es.60 per month to the Political Agent, Persian Gulf. The grant was sanctioned in 1929 as a result of your Government Code llessage No.T.12, dated 28th July, 1929, in which it was stated that the reason for the recommendation v/as the “difficulty and expense of entertaining visitors mainly hut not wholly R.A.F. officers passing along Trucial Coast.

Will you please confirm that this grant is being paid to Khan Bahadur Issa bin Abdul Latlf, and if this is so, v/ill you also let me have youv views as to the continuance of this grant, in view of the fact that as far as is laiown, Issa has not been called upon to entertain any officers of the Royal Air Force for many months oast. h Should an occasion arise at the Ras-al-Khaima where Issa entertains any officers, the cost would appear to be well covered by a payment of IS.5 per day by the officers concerned, as notified in my telegram of 30th July 1929.u Copy of letter Ho.347/81/11-IV, dated the 7th February 1934, from the Hon T hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Air Vice-Marshal, Commanding T Iraq Command, Air Headquarters, Hinaidi.

Lastly the power and influence of the Eesidenoy Agent on the Coast is immense and for this reason, I am inclined to think that he has not given us all the support that we had a right to expect in this affair of the 'Air Station'. Admittedly he has in the past, had a difficult role to play, for lacking visible material support on land and with an insufficient salary, he had perforce had to play up to the local Shaikhs, as well as try and keep in with us. The proposed Air route and Air Station on the Trucial Coast which he looks on as his own special preserve, has I think filled him also with a certain amount of anxiety as to his own future. Though he has loyally tried to see our point of view, I believe in his heart he like the Shaikh, believes that it bodes no good for himself and that in course of time he will be replaced by a British Officer. To get the best out of the Besidency Agent therefore we must, I think, go out of our way to disabuse his mind of any such anxieties. After all it is only natural that he also should suspect our future intentions, living as he does entirely with narrow-minded and ignorant Shaikhs who genuinely believe they have every ground to fear us. The Hesidency Agent is a strong and likeable man- with him whole-heartedly on our side, his influence for good along the whole coast will always be invaluable, in fact we need have no fear of any future trouble whatsoever. The converse also follows I think.^ No. K 1623/851/234 In any further communication on this subject, please quote n and address— Foreign Office. not to any person by name, but to— The Under-Secretary of State.’’ s.w. i Foreign Office, ’ Letulon, S.W. 1. 5th February, 1930. Sir, With reference to India Office letter (p 8047/29) oi the 15th ultimo, regarding the proposed increase in the pay of the Residency Agent at Shargah, and the assignment of a salary to the clerk at that post, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to state that sanction has been obtained from the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury for the charge to Imperial funds of a moiety of the cost involved by the proposals in question. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Under-Secretary of State, India India Office 13 FEB 1930Trucial Coast as the representative of His Majesty’s Government, but finds himself in the course of his duties obliged hospitably to entertain officers of His Majesty’s Government, to pay for clerks, and to maintain the means of transportation. 'Is it to be wondered, M the Political Resident remarks, that in these circumstances Ji*. *«• the object^ of insinuations for which there is no proof?' The case for the increase now proposed is a strong one on all grounds, and we are, I think, justifie in pressing it on the Foreigi Office. But as the increase is substantial, some difficulty with the Treasu may be experienced, and we ought, I think, to strengthen the hands of the ^oreigi Office so far as possible. In these circumstances, with Mr. Worthcott’s concurrence I have slightly modified the second paragraph of his draft, and a fair copy is put up for consideration.,;r. V^akelv . The Agent’s salary is in tact at present divisible, being lumped in with other miscellaneous items under the heading Bushire Residency. But I agree that it is desirable to make this clear, and I have altered the opening words of paragraph 2 of the draft accordingly. I hope the Foreiga Office may be willing to support this proposal. There is of course, here as elsewhere on the Arab littoral, a strong case for an Air Ministry or Co.lonial Office contribution. But the objections to approaching them are, as you say, strong in present circumstances (you will remember that this was felt, too, in connection with Despatch vessel expenditure), if it can in any way be avoided. The Foreign Office will be asked demi- officially to do what they can for us. p.fJsud 7/. A//'3818B 5000 8/29 have/ Draft Paper. The Under Secretary of State, ffinnlr. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. Mo.

Sir, IS JA*11930 I am directed by the Secretary of State for India m Council to forward,to be laid before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a letter from the Government of India, recommending that the pay of the Residency Agent, Shargah, should be increased from Rs.150 to Rs.500 per mensem, and that his clerk, vho has hitherto been paid by the Agent himself, should be granted a salary of Rs.100 per mensem, with effect from the 1 st April, 1930. In this connection I am to refer to the correspondence forwarded to the Foreign Office with this Office letter No. P. 6741 of the • + 22nd October, in which it was reported that Khan Bahadur isa Abdul Latif has been granted an entertain ment allowance of Rs.100 per mensem with effect from the 1 st hay, 1929. 2. The salary drawn by the Residency Agent (which is divided between Indian and Imperial revenues as part of the Bushire Residency expenditure) is the same as was granted to his predecessor so long ago as 1890. During the last 20 years the responsibilities of the posthave greatly increased, and recent air developments in the area, in which His Majesty’s Government is immediately represented by the Residency Agent, have substantially added to its present to on and future importance. The objections leaving at so low a rate as Rs.150 per mensem the pay of the Residency Agent who, in the words of a recent report ffom the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 'is so powerful on the coast and in many ways so valuable” are, in the opinion both of the local authorities a[nd of the Secretary of state in Council, substantial, and the Secretary of State has no hesitation, m the circumstances, in supporting strongly the recommendati now put forward by the Government of India. He trusts that Mr. Henderson will share his views as to the desirability of giving effect to it and, subject to his concurrence and to the acceptance as a charge upon Imperial revenues of a moiety, or such proportion of the cost involved as may ultimately be agreed upon as the result of any decision which may be arrived at regarding the inciden|ce of expenditure in Persia, he proposes to approve it.

Sir, I have the honour to state t’nat on ray recent tour on the Trucial Coast, the Residency Agent, Trucial Coast, represented the difficulty and expense incurred by him in entertaining visitors. These are Uaval, Royal Air Force and Political Officers who visit not only Shargah but also Rast-al-Khaimah, which, as a prospective flying boat harbour is of much interest to R.A.F. Officers. Both difficulty and i expense are enhanced by the distance of Ras-al-Khaimah from steamer communication and the consequent non-availability of European stores. jQBCXXX K.B. Isa endeavours, as far as possible, to provide European Officers with the class of food and cooking to which they are accustomed, and I can vouch from my own experience that his efforts are very successful. 2. The Air Officer Commanding in Iraq, whom I have consulted, has informed me that the R.A.F. are prepared to contribute a sum of Rs.60/- monthly towards the Residency Agent’s entertainment allowance and also to authorise him to charge visiting officers for their entertainment at a rate of not less than Rs. 5/- per day. The Air Officer CommandingCommanding has also stated that the monthly contribution might be increased later. 3 I am not in favour of a system of daily payment by visiting officers. In the vast majority of cases officers would not only pay willingly but would appreciate the diffi culties of the situation and the efforts the Residency Agent had made to overcome them. Sooner or later however there would arrive some young officer fresh from home, unacquainted with Gulf conditions and with Arab sensitiveness, who would find fault with the food or the service and boggle at the payment. Khan Bahadur Isa is an Arab gentleman of the greatest influence on the Trucial Coast and he must be saved from the chance of such indignity. 4. I therefore recommend that with effect from 1st kay during which month the R.A.B. first started visiting Ras-al- Khaxnah the Residency Agent may be granted a fixed sumptuary allowance of Rs. 100/- per mensem. In view of the fact that the Residency Agent's pay is only Rs. 150/- per mensem and that he is obliged to entertain in a style commensurate with the position he occupies in Arab eyes, I consider that the sum of Rs. 100/- per mensem is the least that would suffice. I would recommend Rs.150/- but for the fact that Political Agents draw Rs. 100/- only. 5. The expenditure to be borne by Government during the current year can be met by reappropriation from the head D.6 Compensations - Bushire. 6. In conclusion I recommend that Government nay be pleased to accord very early sanction to the payment of this allowance as K.B. Isa Abdul Latif, O.B.E. continues to incur expenditure and I assured him that Government would undoubtedly grant priority to his request. I have, etc., Sd. C.C.J.
