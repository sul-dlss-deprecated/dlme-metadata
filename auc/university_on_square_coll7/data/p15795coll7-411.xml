He was in Kuwait when he learned that protests were planned, through friends’ posts on Facebook and by watching videos on YouTube.  He had already returned to Egypt when the protests erupted, but did not go to Tahrir Square initially. He explains that the turnout increased on Friday the January 28 when students finished exams.  According to ######, there was a “great spirit” in Tahrir throughout the 18 days with people from all walks of life helping each other, providing food, and securing the square.  ###### describes patrolling his neighborhood for thugs and escaped criminals with a “ligan sha’abiyah” popular committee, and tells of encountering robbers. He singles out Mubarak’s speech on February 1 as the most pivotal point of the revolution, as it left people divided on when he should leave office; ###### himself thought it best for Mubarak to leave in September as he promised, in order to prevent violence and spare lives.  He recalls the sense of pride and achievement among Egyptians after Mubarak was toppled, and how their attitudes – even those who were against the revolution – had grown more positive about Egypt’s future.</dc:description><dc:date>2012-07-19</dc:date><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:identifier>20120719</dc:identifier><dc:relation>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution</dc:relation><dc:source>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution oral histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2012, American University in Cairo.
