One word on the mucli-discussed question of spelling Oriental words in EDglisli. Calcutta, Cawnpore, and an occasional other Indian name have been left in con ventional but convenient faultiness. In other respects, as a general rule, the system last adopted by the Indian Government has been followed : and the reader is re quested to bear in mind that, under this system, 'a' without an accent is short, although there are many instances in which the accent, once used, is not repeated, or is omitted because palpably understood ; ' e ' is pro nounced as in Fez : 44 i' is invariably like ee ; ' o ' is an English o ; and ' u ' is invariably oo. Aware that deviations from an established principle of phonetics applied to language are fairly chargeable to philological inconsistency or ignorance, the author has reserved a respectful argument or excuse for a few exceptional cases. Here and there, however, he admits a difficulty in the absence of any authentic native spelling, such as for certain fishing villages on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf.viii PREFACE. He lias been purposely sparing of accents, using the simple long accent to denote a marked sound, or where the circumflex would be written in French. To take one vowel in illustration, its effect upon a would be to deepen, as in dpre: upon ai, a-o, au, to separate the two vowels, as in the Italian words assdi and Aosta, and the Italian pronunciation of Menelaus ; while ai, ao, au, would simply need the greater stress upon the second letter. Another word on the photographs or original drawings which have been so carefully reproduced in Mr. Cooper's woodcuts. The views of Maskat and Masandam stations are from photographs by Messrs. Lindley and Warren, of Bombay : Astrakhan is from a Russian photograph ob tained on the spot; and the ' Kothal Pir Zan' is from an original coloured drawing by Major 0. B. St. John, R.E. Of the smaller illustrations or viffnettes in the first book, the tailpiece of the introductory chapter, the Oawnpore Monument, Karachi Library, Zobeide's Tomb, and the Wali of Gwadar, are from photographs: the Kothal Dukhtar is Major St. John's; Khasab is by Lieutenant Hewitt, I.N.; the 'Chasseur h, Cheval' is by Mr. Gerard Thomas, M.A.; and Fao is by some friend unknown. The remainder are from original coloured drawings by .Major Bateman-Champain, R.E. In the second book, the Zouave and Ezra's Tomb, in Chapter VIL; the Persians, in Chapters VII. and VIIL; all but the Bastinado, in Chapters IX. and X.; the Shah, and1'REFACE. ix the Bridge at Ispahan, in Chapter XT.; and the Georgian Minstrels and Baluchis, in Chapter X1L, are from photo graphs. The rest are from original drawings, of which the Bastinado and Travelling Chapar are by Captain W. H. Pierson, R.E., to whom is due also the design on the title-page; Demavend, Mian-Kothal, and Besitun are by Major Bateman-Champain ; and others are by kind friends, the omission of whose names will not lead them to suppose that their favours are unappreciated or forgotten. Yet one word more; last in order, but not least important in any sense,—the author would express his great and heartfelt obligations to I\[ajor-Gener{\l Sii William Baker, R.E., K.C.B., to Mr. William Thornton, C.B., and those authorities at the India Office who have afforded him the same steady aid and support in the matter of this book, as in that of his telegraph super intendence generally : a support which has comprehended the sacrifice of time and convenience, and the investi gation of dry detail. And he gladly takes the present opportunity of warmly thanking his successor and late coadjutor. Major Bateman-Champain, R.E., and his late coadjutors and companions, Major Oliver St. John, and Captain William Henry Pierson, R.E., for their original and valuable drawings, and other assistance rendered to him in preparing his volume for the press.

Ft is exactly ten years ago that the Persian Gulf cable, manufactured and laid at the cost of her Majesty's Government, was under process of final submersion be tween Karachi, the most North-Westerly of Indian ports, and the Turkish Arabian station of Ffio, or Fava. The link connectinor Gwadar, then an obscure fishing villaofe O O O of Makran, and Fao, a very molecule amid hamlets, was completed on the 8th April, 1864 ; and notwithstanding the successful establishment of a land line between Karachi and Gwadar, it was thought prudent to connect these stations also by submarine cable, and so strengthen communications. This alternative section was wholly laid on the 15th May, 18G4. But while the Turkish and Indian dominions were thus placed in instantaneous correspondence, the result was a realized fact for Asia only. Out of Asia the benefit of a Persian Gulf cable or land line was barely perceptible. And no wonder. There was an extent of some 1,800 miles to be traversed between the new station at Filo and Constantinople, before the line stretching westward was fairly in Europe: B2 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. and there was a greater distance again between Constan- tmop T e and London. The first of these divisions was not declared open to traffic till February 1865, and the second was so wretchedly served in a telegraphic sense, that it seemed a reasonable question whether the ordinary Post or Foreign Office Messenger was not the surer and swifter means of communication between her Majesty's Government at home and her Majesty's Ambassador at the Sublime Porte. This difficulty in completing connection, by telegraph, of two quarters of the globe daily becoming more and more significant the one for the other, was the less readily met, because the Cis-India land lines in Asia were beyond the immediate control of her Majesty's and the British Indian Governments ; and those in Europe had formed, not unnaturally, a minor consideration in the original Indo-European scheme. Much attention had been given to the creation of new lines in Turkey and Persia, and more still to the construction and disposition of a Persian Gulf cable: but it had been little contem plated that existing European lines would have presented so formidable a barrier as they have since proved them selves to be, to rapid and regular through working. The fact is, that the demand for an electric link with India, generally of an urgent nature, had become, as it were, imperative to England since the sad and serious warn ing afforded by the Mutinies; and the thing required was to be supplied at any price and with as little delay as practicable. The want was no longer confined to com mercial or political interests : it was eminently national. With a view to put matters on a better footing, the main object of Government Officers employed on this particular work was clearly to effect the readiest andINTRODUCTORY. safest junction that could be found, not between England and India, as heretofore, but between England and a cable station in the Persian Gulf. In Asia, Persian as well as Turkish lines were formed and brought into re quisition by British workers, either separate from or supplementary to native lines already in existence. In Europe, negotiations with Governments and Administra tions were opened, conducted, and concluded; Inter national Conferences were participated in ; and every measure was taken which appeared likely to promote the scheme contemplated. From 1865 to 1870, or for more than five years, attention was given to supply wants, to remedy failings, and to remove obstacles. Experiences in such matters may be useful in the record. In any case, a full report of progress, when sufficiently mature, is due to the State, and should be satisfactory to the reporters themselves. Nor is the necessity less obvious, in a public sense, that there should be a reference showing the circumstances under which a great work like the Telegraph to India was undertaken at all; and what have been and what now are its value and cost to the country from whose coffers it has been carried out and carried on. Hence arose the suoxrestion oo that a narrative of the institution and development of Telegraphic Communication between England and India under the orders of her Majesty's Government should be prepared and submitted: and hence was it ruled by the Secretary of State for India in Council, so far back as September 1868, that such relation, when completed, should be published in a quasi-popular form. More, however, remains to be said on this head. It is not always pleasant to call spades by their proper names; but it is often essential to do so, and the present is an4 v TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. instance where plain statements should not be misinter preted. Before the establishment of the latest Red Sea cable to Bombay, and about the period of its inauguration, the Government Telegraph lines to India were assailed in the press and other influential quarters in no measured terms. Among other pungent propositions, public opinion was asked to 44 decide for itself whether public money is being applied with common sense or at the in stigation of those interested, who up to this time have monopolized the confidence and attention of the Govern ment?' Letters and leaders pursued the subject so determinedly that the Government Officers concerned, loth to avail themselves of the weapons used by their assailants, were nevertheless driven into newspaper con troversy. Per contra, in November 1865, the present writer, then Chief Director, had stated to the Bombay Govern ment : ' It cannot be supposed that the electric wire ' can be conveyed for 5,000 miles by sea and land through 'the whole of Europe and South-West Asia with the ' same facility that its progress may be traced in pencil '' on the map. ... I am humbly of opinion, that unless ' some unforeseen great accident, physical or political, 'intervene, they'—that is, the Indian public—'will, 'ere long, possess, whatever the route, the means of sure ' and speedy communication with the old country. . . .' About twenty months later he had, through the same channel, shown cause for delays and failures, without relaxing effort or losing hope in then pending arrange ments. And as late as January 1869, the Bombay Government published in the local press his renewed expressions of confidence in the lines impugned. These are the concluding words: ' Judging from antecedents.INTRODUCTORY. 5 ' my own opinion is in favour of eventual success ; and by ''success' 1 am not employing the ordinary acceptation ' of the term: past and present records will show this to 'have been long since attained by the Indo-European 'line. I mean that the 'within 24' and 'within 48' ' hour messages of the present day w T ill habitually arrive ' within 12 hours ; that regularity and correctness may ' before many months be the rule ; and that the corre- &lt;£ spondence will be subject to even a lower rate of tariff 'than the present.' The last extract is from a letter just four years old. And what are the results to be quoted in evidence, now that ten years have passed since laying the cable in the Persian Gulf? Are they favourable to the arguments of the Government Officers, or of those who set them aside as unsupported by experience or sound reasoning ? Fair and impartial judgment is invited on all sides. It is true that a Company has organized and established a Submarine Line to India, the success of which affects injuriously the revenues of the State : but the Directors of that line themselves would be the last to maintain that the older and much vilified telegraph, crossing- lands as well as seas, was a rival to be lightly esteemed. Nor can it be a source of surprise, as it is really no secret, that they should seek to join fortunes in a common purse with their opponents, rather than continue a com petition as unexpected as severe. At the present time, the columns of the daily papers furnish abundant proof of the successful working of what is called the Indo- European system. Day after day do its wires bring home the news of the hour : and at the very moment of writing these lines does the casually taken-up Times of the morning contain an urgent message, sadly headedc TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. 'The Bengal Famine,' conveyed by Indo-European Telegraph via Tehran,' and addressed from Calcutta at 7.35 of the previous night. Such direct and conclusive testimony might be con sidered sufficient answer to the augurers of ill; to say nothing of the marvellous instances of instantaneous working obtained from tests made, within the last four years, by the London Offices in communication with those of Persia and India. But it is no less common to ascribe to chance and good fortune the successful issues of mental and physical toil, than to censure and condemn ill-starred agents for mishaps and reverses due to adverse circumstances beyond all human foresight and control. And, as in the case of the Government Telegraph to India a full statement of proceedings was judged offi cially advisable, the requirement became still more urgent on general grounds. It was therefore no regret table accident that the pressure of travel and other duties incidental to his appointment compelled the Chief Director to defer the looked-for report until giving over charge in 1870, preparatory to availing himself of one year's respite from work. That he was, afterwards, called away during the same year to political duty and employed until March 1873 in the settlement of boundary questions, must explain the further delay apparent in submitting the volume to the public. A few explanatory words, in conclusion, on the book itself. Those who knew Colonel Patrick Stewart, personally or by repute, during his short but active career, will not need to be told why the opening chapter should be devoted to a sketch of his life. He it was who, during the conduct of Indian affairs by Sir Charles Wood (now Lord Halifax), was chosen to give practical effect to theINTRODUCTORY. 7 wishes of her Majesty's Government that India should be joined to Great Britain by Telegraph wires; to ad vise on the matter, to regulate, to control, and to execute. The first entire section of his work, the Persian Gulf Cable, was a brilliant success, and has been proved a permanent one. He scarcely lived to complete more ; but he had put others in the way of achieving what he had so well begun. Conscientious readers will not dis pute his title to the place of honour in these pages. The two parts, headed ' Telegraph ' and ' Travel' respectively, are designed to divide strictly official nar rative from personal observation and record. Should the first be found painfully practical and matter of fact, overburdened with official details and wanting in the zest which keeps the eye willingly open and the hand steady to the book, the writer may reasonably claim some kind of excuse in the necessarily monotonous nature of the subject. As for the second, he must accept personal responsibility, and trust to kindly critics for tolerant dealing with his shortcomings. It will, at least, possess the recommendation of treating of little- known countries, and, in the case of the two final chapters, going over ground untrodden, with rare ex ceptions, by other European travellers at all. One inevitable consequence of an institution such as the British Telegraph in Persia, at least for those officers called away from Indian service to assist in its rise, progress, and maintenance, is the realization of some thing like genuine ' Overland ' communication between England and India. Those who return homeward from Tehran have the choice of two main routes ; one by Kussia, the other by Turkey. For those who proceed, on the other hand, to India from the Persian capital, Immmtm &amp; !'.■ V * p. tr S TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. there is the Baghdad route, the Bushahr route, and the complete land route by Karman and Baluchistan. The respective merits of all these will, it is hoped, be suf ficiently exemplified in the course of this volume to make present mention superfluous. Meanwhile, it may be fitly remarked that the 44 Overland ' here indicated does not rest its titular claim on the transit of a narrow isthmus, the verv material of which was not lono- since O abstracted by M. Ferdinand de Lesseps ; its integrity as a means of land communication having been already impaired, at the outset, by a water passage of some hours on the Nile and Mahmudieh canal. the common nile boat.CHAPTER 1. memoir of colonel patrick stewart. The subject of the following brief sketch is one of those men to whom a single chapter of an ordinary volume can render but poor justice. It is therefore quite as much because Patrick Stewart, as originator of the first practical Telegraph to India, is entitled personally to the first place of consideration in a history of that Telegraph, as because he has left behind him a distinguished name and example, that the merest biographical out line is given to a character worthy of a full and care fully finished portrait. It is a character which merits imitation as well as study; and as it could not fail to influence those moving within its range during a short but busy life, so should a record of its existence be perpetuated for the advantage of new generations. Patrick Stewart was the second son of James Stewart, Esquire, of Cairnsmore, in Kirkcudbrightshire. He was born at the family residence on the 28th of January, 1832, and at ten years of age was sent to the Grange, near Sunderland, in Durham, then kept by Dr. Cowan. Thence, having been there more than four years, he went for a time to Perry Hill, at Sydenham. On the close of the Midsummer vacation of 1848 he entered the East India Company's Military College at Addiscombe,10 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. when the late Sir Ephraim Stannus was Lieutenant- Governor. Now that Addiseombe is among the things of the past, and as even half a score of years eilect much towards the obliteration of a mere reminiscence, it may not be out of place to say a few words on an institution which has produced many remarkable men of more than Indian reputation. Two years' experience of the place in the capacity of Orderly Officer, though hardly equal to a cadet's probation for the same period, is, perhaps, a better warrant of comprehension of the subject than any amount of remote investigation ; and it was for the last month or two of such experience that the present writer had the advantage of becoming acquainted with the bright, intelligent, fair-haired boy with whom in after manhood it was his fortune to be associated, and to whose career this chapter is devoted. The old College at Addiscombe was formed by transfer of the East India Company's Military cadets from Mariow and Woolwich, in 1809, to the house and grounds near Croydon formerly belonging to Lord Liverpool. During the time of that distinguished statesman the place had been the resort of many great men of the period; and its associations are eminently interesting in connection with the social and political history of the reign of George the Third. It may not be generally known, that, after possession by the East India Company and during the Governorship of Major Carmichael Smythe of the Bengal Engineers, the late William Makepeace Thackeray, that officer's stepson, was an inmate of the mansion. 1 Though not in the most picturesque part 1 Nor is it unnatural to infer that one, whose affectionate instincts were scarcely less remarkable than his intellectual powers, should have derived his,.] MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 11 of one of the most picturesque counties of England, it is in ci fine healthy locality, and in the immediate neigh bourhood of very charming spots. There were about 150 Cadets in the College, and these formed four distinct sections :— 1. Students in their fourth, or last half year of study distinguished as old cadets. 2. Those in their third term, or young cadets. 3. Those in their second term, or second half of the first year ; and 4. Those undergoing the experience of the first half year : the two last being not very elegantly styled ' Browns ' and ' Greens ' respectively. At the close of each half year, whether June or December, the old cadets were draughted away to their respective destinations : those who had passed the highest ordeal, to Chatham as Engineers ; the next in merit into the Artillery; and the least successful on examination, to the Infantry. A Cavalry commission was occasionally available, according to interest or inclination, essentially the former. It may be safely said that the faults or shortcomings of the institution were few in comparison with its use as a rearing-place of young military aspi rants ; and that those few mainly arose from defects of discipline in controlling unruly spirits. Among its Professors were many whose names live in the scientific world as well as in the memory of the Addiscombe cadet. Its Governors are thought of with affectionate regard by those who not only knew them as men, but could sym- predilections for Indian scenes and Indian persons from this early family connection with a nursery of Indian celebrities, as from a yet more distant retrospect of India itself.1-2 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chat. pathise with their responsibilities as discharging an important trust; and set in the balance with similar establishments at home and abroad, there is little doubt but that the Hon. Company's Military College at Addiscombe would put in a creditable appearance. Patrick Stewart was not a boy to remain long unknown, or in a secondary position. At the end of his first term at Addiscombe he came out first of the ' Greens in Ma thematics and Fortification, and his general character for ability and assiduity was such as to stamp him a student of unusual promise. Whether it is that the subject is not so popular, or that it has not possessed chroniclers of equal attraction, it may be hard to say ; but the strictly military curriculum of study has never been so thoroughly and pleasantly known to the general reader as that of Rugby or Harrow. Yet there were many Tom Browns and Walters 1 at Addiscombe, as there must be in all large assemblies of English gentlemen's sons. Young- o o o o Stewart possessed one of those natures for which honour and high principle were guiding stars, without, as it were, any outward evidence of their shining. Free from any semblance of pride or pedantry, he preferred study to idleness, and manly sport to boyish dissipation ; and it is therefore with no surprise that we find him, during his first few months' residence at the school, glad to get to his books and escape certain recognized exhibitions which may be called of a modified music-hall character, and in which it was the special privilege of the ' Greens ' to display their powers for the amusement of the old cadets. Boxing and singing were conspicuous among these. Now, a spar may not be unwholesome exercise, nor a fight always unprofitable occupation, in a wide sense of 1 See Mr. Farrar's ' St. Winifred's ; or, the World of School.',_j MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 13 the words; but a sensible lad of sixteen does not in variably apprehend why he should nitike himselt a public spectacle in either. Again, it is not always easy or con venient to exercise vocal accopmlishments at the will and pleasure of bigger boys; and when to these com pulsory representations the vice of drinking is added, it is surely better to see the power of resistance effectually applied than the hand extended in token of approval and sympathy. Before long, however, and by the kind and readily-offered aid of one or two true friends—for there is unmistakeable truth in the friendship of boys—Patrick- Stewart made for himself a comfortable social position, and fell easily into the groove of a cadet's life, both as regards the goodwill and esteem of his companions and the tio-ht stock and uniform so ominous of a future career O of discipline. As for parades, there must have been something like fifteen in the twenty-four hours. That he was not insensible to the want of relief from a strict attention to work and duty his companions of boyhood would bear ample testimony ; and, irrespective of participation in football and the regulation school games, there is a record that, during his second term, one Monday afternoon in March, after a parade of two hours' duration, he and four companions started for a chalk-pit about 5-J miles distant, on the Godstone road, he and one other only reaching the goal, and returning to declare the whole distance of 11 miles performed in one hour and three-quarters. A mile in six minutes was his practised running. During his second year of Addiscombe life there is a marked period of disturbances, in which, however, Stewart seems to have had little concern. The dis orderly element was exhibited at this time in a moreTELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. prominent manner than usual, and recourse was had to stern and severe measures. Our cadet was made, in his fourth term, a Corporal, and in this capacity found him self in no very enviable position, having to exercise supervision and to find fault where such interference would not always be well received. But the necessity of schooling and practice, in enforcing as in enduring discipline, is sufficiently urgent in a military career to demand early attention ; and the system of Corporal Cadets is no doubt as wholesome as it is useful. His progress in study can hardly be said to have been so rapid as that he continued to maintain the high position in his chiss and among his comrades which he had attained on first admission. Especially was it in mathematics and fortification that he became distinguished. Head of his term in mathematics at the end of his third half year as the first, we find him at the completion of the full period of two years carrying off the first Fortification and second Mathematical prize, together with the Sword and Pollock Medal, the former being a reward for conduct, the latter for progress in study. As among the choicest of ordinary mundane returns of a toilsome career are the congratulations of old friends on a fairly-achieved success, so among the fairest records of Patrick Stewart's biography would be those many spontaneous testimonials of his work contained in the congratulatory letters of his contemporaries in the service. A letter from a brother Engineer in Brompton Barracks addressed to Cairnsmore immediately followed the news of his Addiscombe successes. The writer has since nobly fallen in the service of his country. Had he been living, he would assuredly have pardoned these quotations;—i.j MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 15 'One line to congratulate you on the well-deserved success of your dear Pat. He has indeed done bravely, and realized what his friends expected of him. I say ' expected,' for all who know him would expect from him what few others could even hope from those who are not Pats. I was quite horrified to see the hollows all over his body, and his bones sticking out. ... I feel quite proud of him when I hear anybody speak of him, and to be able to say that we are great chums ; and I look forward with no small pleasure to have him with me at Chatham.' It was the usual practice for Addiscombe cadets quali fying as Engineers to receive commissions as Ensigns at home, and remain for a year and a half at Chatham, 1 whence, and after which probation, they proceeded to India. The choice of Presidency was generally given to the most forward of the term ; but the final distribution depended naturally on local exigencies and requirements. Stewart selected and obtained Bengal, the most popular Presidency among the cadets, and for excellent reasons : it basked in the special sunshine of the supreme Govern ment, and it offered by far the greater number of good appointments. Bombay, partly from position, partly from a certain energy and impulsiveness which kept it more prominently before the eyes of the civilized world, was the second in consideration; and Madras was un- mistakeably last on the list. Indeed, it may be ques tioned whether any but those influenced by family or friendly connections with the place would have chosen Madras at all as a field for action. Ensign Stewart's entrance to Chatham life was accom plished in the orthodox manner. He had to fit up his 1 In 1852 the period was extended from sixteen to nineteen months.in TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

In the process, he became acquainted not only with his own chairs, tables, knives, forks, spoons, and table-linen, but with his own mops, brooms, pails, and cooking utensils. He had, then, to be initiated and practised in the daily pursuits, whether oi duty, pleasure, or necessity : attendance at parades in the morning, surveys during the day, and mess in the evening, with, perhaps, what was called '' extra work,' such as French and journalising at night, formed a not uncommon order in the programme. A small yacht in the Medway afforded something of recrea tion ; but of shooting, there is mention only, at the time, of one covey of partridges pursued by half the garrison till the birds were so wild there was no getting near them. Not many months, however, had passed when archi tectural drawings, and projects for attack and demoli tion, engaged his attention ; and these were succeeded by more special employment in reviewing a plan which had been put forward for the sea-coast defences of England. There is good reason to believe that the young officer's report on this last important matter was favourably received by the recognized authorities in military science. Ihe Exhibition of 1851, to which he was fortunate enough to gain admission prior to its formal opening, was an occasion to him of hi^h gratification. The ' splendid pieces of machinery,' to use his own words, were well fitted to attract his particular notice, and awake enthusiasm in the course of description. The studies of this year were pleasantly relieved by an occa sional visit to friends in London, inspection of monu-i.J MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 17 merits and objects of general or scientific interest in the metropolis, and a levee and presentation at St. James's Palace. In 1852, there is recorded a civil engineering excur sion from Chatham to some of the principal towns and notable places in England ; the little expense and great advantage attending which method of combining amuse ment and instruction should be suggestive of frequent repetition. The party consisted of ten cadets and a superintending officer. From the Great Western terminus in London they went by express to Swindon, where they visited the large engine manufactory and iron works. From Swindon they went to Bristol and Clifton, down the Avon, across the Severn, and up the Wye to Chepstow; where, landing with his comrades imme diately below the new bridge, young Stewart had the great good fortune to be accompanied over the works by Brunei himself. From Chepstow they proceeded to ^ Cardiff and its docks ; thence to Merthyr Tydvil and its ironworks ; thence to Liverpool, Birkenhead, Manchester, Birmingham, and London again. At the close of a pleasant and profitable fortnight they were back at Chatham. This agreeable and practical lesson may be said to have terminated the preliminary or English course of engineering study. On the 30th June of the same year 1 atrick Stewart embarked at Gravesend for Calcutta. He had taken his passage, vid the Cape, in the Maid- alone, a sailing vessel. Some warm-hearted young com panions made marked demonstration of their friendship by escorting him to the very side of the ship as she was m the act of weighing anchor. A voyage to India round the Cape, however tedious c18 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. and unprofitable to some, may be productive of both enjoyment and benefit to many, especially to those who, with a keen sensibility to novelty and outward im pressions, possess that happy facility of observation, with intent to apply, peculiar to certain constitutions. The recollection of three or four months passed at sea must necessarily be vague in after life, and the more so as a voyage is repeated ; but the diary of such episodes is not a whit the less valuable on that account; and a record of such experience, whether in the shape of a small manuscript volume or home letters, may be safely recommended to every young adventurer who can handle a pen, whatever his station or employment. Stewart's ship letters, written with all the candour and genuineness of honest boyhood, give many signs of a reasoning intelligence and comprehensiveness of mind which belong essentially to the full-grown man. Por traits of fellow-passengers and the narrative of adven tures and amusements of a voyage differing little from other voyages are thus agreeably varied with descriptions of scenery, people, and atmospheric phenomena. They made a passage of unusual rapidity, having left the English coast on the 4th July and taken in the pilot at Sagar on the 13th October, or less than three months, allowing for a ten days' detention at the Cape. At Table Bay they were visited by one of those strong north-westerly gales against which, notwithstanding their frequent occurrence, the shipping appears to have been but little protected. So unsafe indeed were they con sidered in that particular instance, that a life-boat and some of the largest trading-boats were despatched from the shore, to land the soldiers in the event of accident to the vessel in her exposed anchorage. Owing to deten-i.j MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 19 tion for a day at Sagar, a well-known island at the mouth of the Hugli, Stewart and a fellow-passenger landed, and penetrated the jungle. The young Engineer, intuitively a sportsman, did not fail to notice there the recent tracks of very large tigers. Gazetted a Second Lieutenant of Engineers from the 16th October, 1852, Patrick Stewart did not long remain unemployed at Calcutta. However warm his reception and pleasant his sojourn at the hospitable mansion of Mr. John Colvin, 1 in Alipur, and however attractive the snipe-shooting excursions to Nil Ganj and the general novelty of outdoor and indoor Indian amusements, he readily availed himself of a friendly suggestion to apply for appointment to a vacancy in the Canal Department under Colonel Cautley. This officer being, however, absent some thousand miles up country, the application could not be answered at once; and in the meantime Colonel Garstin, Commanding Engineer at Calcutta, found work for his newly arrived subalterns in a sur vey within easy distance of the Presidency. There was some talk of sending young Engineer officers to Birmah, for annexation in that quarter was then im minent. Put the prospect was not inviting, and the chance of active service seemed at the moment to have passed away. In November he started for Bardwan, near which place he had been instructed to commence the survey. The ' bands,' or artificial banks of the Damuda, a river running into the Hugli, were to be carefully in spected ; and the tract of country to be surveyed was stated to be from 12 to 15 miles in width and 70 in length, in addition to which numerous lines of levels Afterwards Lieutenant-Governor of the North West Provinces. c 220 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. were to be taken. Measuring from its north-westerly extremity to Am^taJ^opposite Calcutta, the ' district,' in technical phrase, may be said to have extended about 100 miles. Those who know the localities would readily recognize the scene of operations between the Damuda and a second river, the Rup Narain. The waters of both were kept within their natural banks by a common but costly contrivance; and the object of the survey was to ascertain whether no other and more economical method could be adopted. Lieutenant de Bourbel was associated with Lieutenant Stewart on this service; but their individual duties kept them, as a rule, many miles apart. r l he latter, though somewhat ailing on first reaching Bard wan, seems to have had sufficiently good general health to enjoy his tent life in the cold weather. During leisure hours, his dog, his gun, and a country abounding with large and small game, afforded him ample means of recreation. But as the hot winds and hot season drew on, fever and its accompaniments made troublesome visitation. Attended by kind friends on those occasions, the kindly feelings of reciprocity engendered in his own breast were destined to receive a shock not uncommon in India. His description of the sad and sudden death, by cholera, of a young and amiable lady, the wife of an officer, in the compound or enclosure of whose house his tents were pitched, reveals a sensibility not unbecoming a brave and noble nature. The language of honest pathos and sympathy in which the calamity is detailed is appropriate to a narrative of which the bare reality has a thrilling interest. Colonel Cautley had forwarded the application for Stewarts employment on the canals, and had offeredi.j MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 21 him an appointment on the executive staff of the Ganges Canal Department, which he had not hesitated to accept. Other openings, however, presented themselves to him ; and at the commencement of May, 1853, he writes that he has been gazetted to the office of Super intendent of Electuc 1 elegraphs during the absence of Dr. O'Shaughnessy, then on special duty in Europe. His prolonged and tedious survey had been completed ; and his proposal for a new bed to the Damuda, 10 miles iu extent, though at first approved, was eventually countermanded on account of the expensive nature of the work. The position now occupied was an important one, and the fact of its importance naturally enhanced the credit of the young man of one and-twenty who had been selected as a fitting incumbent. His selection, moreover, appeals to luue been made by the Local Government on immediate experience of his merits, and without any solicitation or even expectation on his part. Mr. Siddons, the Chemical Examiner to Government, had been first appointed to act for Dr. O'Shaughnessy, but on the death of that gentleman, after a few hours' illness, by cholera, Stewart was immediately directed to officiate. In no (ounti^ but India could the abilities of a young military officer be provided with the wide field for dis play suddenly exemplified in instances such as this. He fouud himself in charge of an office at the Presidency, with a large establishment of assistants, as head of a epaitment in direct communication with the Govern ment, to all intents and purposes his own master. Con- dential intelligence connected with State interests must necessarily pass through his hands : he would be brought constant!} before the hotice of the highest authorities of22 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. the land ; no wonder that he felt ^gratified at the compli-' ment paid to his talents and industry. v His early observations, on taking charge of the Tele graph in Bengal, are syfficiently relevant,to the present work to call for passing record. He writes from Calcutta in May:— 44 The lightning has come into the offices several times lately, destroying parts of the instruments completely, and sounding all the alarms. I have now before me one of the coils of fine wire, the cardboard of which was burned to a cinder last night, and the wire itself melted by the lightning, without injuring seriously anyone in the office. On the lo^er parts of the line near the bay, there are immense numbers of wild buffa loes that continually come to rub themselves on the posts of the telegraph, and not unfrequently knock them down, or break them. I hope to pay my respects to, some of them this week. Great numbers of birds,, such as crows, kites, fishing eagles^ &amp;c., have been killed while sitting on the iron rods, by flashes of lightning, passing along them.' About a fortnight later the writer reports fulfilment of his hopes of encountering the buffa loes, and that he is expecting two pairs of horns, which are to be sent home should they arrive in tolerably good condition. ^Lieutenant Stewart, besides making tours of inspec- tion, was employed in arranging for the transmission and 'distribution of stores and instruments for the whole line from Calcutta to Lahor, and from Agra to Indor, 1,7Q0 miles of telegraph. Nor did the lines down the river escape -his attention. Among his first acts was to lay down and put in working order a 10-mile line from the Diamond Harbour Station to a dangerous shoal in the Hugli, the progress of vessels over whichi.] MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 23 it was important to report to Government. It was only in the first; month of' his incumbency that he received orders to send stores of every description for a line from Prom to Sandoway in Birmah. It is a icmaikable circumstance, illustrative of the then fast growing sus picion of the actions and motives ot their rulers on the part of the people of India, that the majority of the natives did not believe in the working of the telegiaph lines at all, and in many cases maintained that we ' were cheating them out of their money without being able to send a single message ! ' In October, Stewart was appointed Aide-de-camp to , the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Provinces, on Mr. Colvin's accession to that high offire. P)ut such proof of personal regard and friendliness could have but temporary effect. An officer of the scientific branch of the army, and of such high repute for so young a man, could not be spared for duties comparatively trivial; and the Aide-de-camp still continued 'to control the wires ; on the understanding that relief from the depart mental superintendence would restore him to more strictly military duty in superintending a fortified can tonment projected for Firuzpur. When, moreover, Mr. Colvin had his audience of leave of .the Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie took the opportunity of the official attendance of the young Engineer, to address him by name, and thank him for the able assistance he had rendered Government since lie had held charge .of the Telegraph. Not long after this occurrence, Dr. 0'Shaugh- v nessy returned from England, and Lieutenant Stewart's connection with the Indian telegraphs ceased, at^ least for a time. • While on this subject, an article may be quoted fromTELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. the Friend of India, dated the 6th April, 1854. Con- temporaiy opinion is always of value when obtained from a reliable source. In this case the high character of the paper needs no evidence : but there is further evidence than any contained in its columns to show that the published eulogium was merely an act of justice :—* ' There is one officer who has been concerned in the successful introduction of the Electric Telegraph, who has never received his due meed of approbation from the public. To Mr. Stewart, while acting as Superintendent of the experimental line, is due the credit of making all those arrangements which are so es sential to success, yet are so seldom appreciated. Partly from the absence of any tangible result, and partly perhaps from the impression that so very young an officer could lend no serious aid to the work in hand, his services have been overlooked by all except his superiors. Yet his task was by no means light. The line was to be extended at once to Lahor, a distance of 1,280 miles ; Dr. O'Shaughnessy had expressed a wish that depots should be established at seven different places, and Government and the public were alike known to be feverishly impatient for success. Meanwhile, each successive ship dis charged in Calcutta a portion of the materials required. Forty artificers arrived. Then came tons of wire, and miles of wire insulated with gutta-percha, besides the machines for straighten ing the lines. Thousands, or we may say hundreds of thousands, of posts were to be fixed at equidistant places all along this immense line, part of which runs through a tract where bain- boos are only known by name, and where timber is an almost unattainable luxury. Then all these posts were to be grooved. 'They_were to be set up 'properly,' a phrase which will be readily comprehended by those who know what it is to instruct native artificers to act according to rule on a work of which they do not know the object or the reason. Lastly, all this was to be effected in a country where there is but one road and no rail ways,— where delay is a habit, and unconscious disobedience perpetual,—and by an officer with no authority over anyone l;ii.j MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 25 except iiis signallers,—and so young, that his appointment was received with a feeling of surprise. Let our readers remember how impossible a large combined operation is in this country, how frequently the most explicit instructions are misunder stood, and how great a danger existed of wires, men, and ma chinery all turning up anywhere except in juxta-position, and they will appreciate the nature of the task. Mr. Stewart's energy, perseverance, and good temper accomplished this most annoying duty. By dint of endless correspondence, which in cluded the Military Board and the executive Engineers, all was placed in train. The artificers were despatched by steamer to the depots, and reached them. The wire was carried by steamer and bullock-carts to thirty-two different places between Cal- ciHta and Benares alone, all at unequal distances, and all, therefore, requiring their special length of coil. The straighten ing machines did not arrive in time, and they were made at the Kidderpur iron-yard, under Mr. Stewart's immediate super intendence. Throughout the line there was not, we believe, a blunder, or a single day's delay, and when Dr. O'Shaughnes'sy aimed, he found himself able to drive on the work as rapidly as if he himself had been upon the spot. We think it just that, in meting out their praise for this great undertaking, the public should not forget the officer who so successfully performed a task, none the less irksome that it was from its nature unat tended by publicity or credit. ' It may not be unnecessary to state that we are not indebted for any of our facts to Mr. Stewart.' Towards the close of the year 1853 an incident occurred which, though unconnected with official pro- gress or proceedings, is too remarkable to be omitted from the present brief memoir. Narratives of perilous encounter and marvellous escape are common enough to students in the annals of Indian Shikar, but seldom has the hero of an adventure such as the following lived to tell his own tale. Stew ait had left the Lieutenarit-Governoi's camp at28 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. Mirzapur on the night of the 25th November for a day's shooting, and intending to return on the night of the 26th. He had been especially cautioned not to venture into the jungles, with the chance of meeting a tiger when on foot; but an eager temperament and intense love of sport overcame caution. He fell in with three brother sportsmen living in a ruined fort in the jungle. They went out together, found and attacked the too probable enemy; and a tigress was wounded in the leg. A wounded tiger may become the scourge of a district: it was natural that English sportsmen should make every attempt to kill the beast rather than leave her slightly disabled close to several large native villages. They tracked her by the blood, still wet beneath their feet, up the face of a steep stony hill, to a mass of rocks where was a cave, the mouth of which was visible above them. The place was very dangerous. They knew that the object of pursuit was close at hand, and most probably in the cave. A council Was held, and it was proposed to defer proceedings till the following morning, in order to get buffaloes to the place, and, by driving them among the rocks, make the tigress show herself. Stewart opposed the delay. He had left camp on the understanding that he was to return that night, and in his eagerness to lose no time went straight up to the mouth of the cave and looked in. Providentially, nothing was there. He then tracked the blood a little beyond the spot; but as darkness drew on, he yielded to the general wish, and agreed to await the morning for further operations. Having to pass the place on his return to camp, he reckoned that an hour up the hill, added to the night's absence, would not cause any serious detention.i.] MEMOIR OF COLONEL FAT RICK STEWART. 27 The next morning there was delay in procuring buffa loes, and the party had to go to work without them. The blood of the wounded animal being, moreover, dry, it was difficult to ascertain her precise locality. Division of opinion as to her movements ensued, the trail became lost, and there was a partial separation of the guns. Stewart appears to have been hidden from his com panions by intervening bushes, when, crouching in a comparatively open part of the jungle, the tigress saw him approach and unexpectedly dashed on him. Struck down to the ground, he remained motionless. From his own account, he had no inclination to call out; and well that it was so. A strange necessity is that of suppressino- all signs of the life it is man's instinct as well as duty to preserve. His enemy passed him, but soon returned to seize him by the left calf, changing to the thigh in an attempt to carry him off. Thinking her victim dead, she dropped him from her mouth, then struck him with her closed paw and left him, not, however, till she had inflicted no less than thirteen indelible wounds. On being found by his companions, he helped them for the moment in binding up his own wounds, but soon sank into a kind of delirium. He was put upon a litter, taken into Chunar, and by care and skill enabled in a few weeks to resume his wonted occupations. A letter from the highest authority in India expressed to a mutual friend how grieved he had been to learn the serious accident just related, and added a characteristic message for delivery to the sufferer, when recovered, that he deserved a ' skelping, for exposing a life that we all expect to be a useful one.' Were this a biography instead of a brief memoir, many pages might be filled with Stewart's experiencrs28 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. of Shikar. His love for the pursuit of large game was exhibited in the first six months of his residence in India. No better example of this dominant feeling could be found than when, on one occasion, standing below ci certain tree, he fired at and wounded two bears nibblino- fruit among its branches. One he killed on its descent: the other he ran after single-handed till it took refuofe in the jungle. Stewart left the Lieutenant-Governor's personal start' in January, and proceeded to Firuzpur vid Delhi and Ambalah. In any but the scientific branches of the Indian Array the bare mention of some of the appoint ments he filled, or of which he had the offer, would prove a rare versatility of talent, and that he was held in peculiar esteem by his superiors. But it would be unfair to the distinguished corps to which he belonged to pass over the fact that its younger officers are not uncommonly called to posts such as hoary-headed veterans in military lore might consider it an honour to hold. Stewart himself notes casually the circumstance that he had been named to no less than seven appointments in six months, the first, it is believed, of his Indian service. For the years 1854, 1855, and the first half of 1856, his field of action was the Panjab ; but in stating that his principal charge was a division of the Grand Trunk road, a very faint idea is given of the usefulness of his presence in a country illustrating perhaps the most important and successful annexation accomplished by British India. During the period stated, he is found, independently of his road supervision, fulfil ling the double duties of Garrison Engineer at Lahor and Superintendent of Civil Buildings at Anarkallee : he watches over the construction of models of IndianI] MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 29 tombs for the Paris Exhibition of 1855 : he is more or less engaged in constructing fortified cantonments for Firuzpur, in designing a college for Labor :-it is authori tatively proposed that he shall undertake, at Rurki, the re-organization of the Pontoon train; that he shall become Secretary to the Chief Engineer in the Panjab (Colonel Napier, now General Lord Napier of Magdala). The nature of his occupations on the roads may be readily imagined from a passage in one of his letters, dated August 1854. He then writes that he has five saddle-horses, and that he requires them all to get through his outdoor work. He hoped to carry out the whole programme within twelve weeks, but adds that there were still twenty bridges to complete! A previous letter had explained the extent of his charge to be nearly 200 miles; and a subsequent one reports completion of his bridges at the time intended, notwithstanding a sharp intervening attack of fever. In July, 1856, he was appointed for the second time to the Electric Telegraph, and on this occasion to an acting-superintendence on a large scale. vThe vacancy had been caused by the de- parture again to Europe of Dr. O'Shaughnessy and the qleath of Lieutenant Chauncey. Stewards health had not been unaffected by the climate, but lie had suffered more severely from accidental injuries than those incidental to Indian service. To the wounds inflicted by the tigress in 185,3 might be added a severe fall from his horse at the close of 1854, when riding at full gallop. He and a party were hawking and in chase of bustard, and the horse he rode, uncon sciously plunging both forelegs into a concealed hole, rolled over, throwing his rider far beyond him on the hard ground. He fell on his temples, was carried away 11i * 30 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. senseless and narrowly escaped brain fever. At the commencement of 1856 a racket-ball struck him so violently near the left eye as to knock him down and cut an artery, causing much loss of blood before surgical aid could be obtained. Indeed, about the time of this last occurrence he had acquired a great local reputation as the most unfortunate of beings in respect of hurts and tumbles. From the date of re-aj^pointment to the Telegraph, a more marked individuality may be traced in Stewart's career. Always a rising man, his rise was in a certain sense impeded by the extent and indefin iteness of the sphere in which he moved. It was not so much that he was doing an undefined work, but doing work which it I; was the property of many of his colleagues to do, and in which his short period of service must inevitably keep him in comparatively subordinate employ. In the Tele graph, as constituted in 1856, he was at once set on a pinnacle; and his proceedings were watched, not from friendly interest towards himself, but from the great public and State interests involved in his appointment, which could not, therefore fail to attract the attention of practical statesmen. At the same time, there were other spheres in which he must have been equally distin guished. The bent of his mind was for work—practical, useful work : his genius was especially energetic and active ; his restlessness was that of a man seeking appro priate fields of ambition. A very few months before nomination to act as Superintendent of Electric Tele graphs in India he had been sighing for a sight of the magnificent valleys north-east of Kashmir; not merely for sport, great as the temptation offered : he ' would still try to make the same excursion, even if there were Lfi.j MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 31 not an animal in the whole country.' One of his brother officers had applied for and obtained an appoint ment in the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, and had been then ordered to Kashmir, whence he would move towards Thibet. On this he writes : ' It is likely to be a most interesting, though rather diffi cult undertaking. Many of the passes he must cross are 19,000 feet and upwards; elevations that look down considerably on Mr. Albert Smith and Mont Blanc.' His enthusiasm was great in contemplating the work then in progress. It was one quite to his own heart; and though not himself destined to participate in it, few would have acknowledged more readily than he the admirable manner in wljich it has been performed, had he lived to see the results of the labours of Captain Montgomerie and his associates. On taking up his appointment, Stewart contemplates a tour during the first six months, 'from one end of India to the other from Ceylon to Simla and Peshawar, and from Prom to Bombay and Karachi.' As regards the extent of the telegraph branches, he notes the fact that nearly 4,000 miles of line are nqw working, and about 3,000 more are ordered, and may probably be completed within a year;' adding, ' it is interesting work, and of a nature likely to become more and more so every year from the progress made in the science.' India was indeed making a gigantic effort to vie with the sister empires of Europe in this latest but not least im portant demand of civilization; and at a time when her progress and prosperity were threatened by a visitation which, if foreseen in its reality, might have been inter preted by the wisest of political seers as fraught with paralysis and death.TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap Owing to sickness and other causes, the intended tour was not commenced until the hot weather of 1857. On the 19th April of that year, the Acting-Superintendent arrived at Galle from Calcutta, and arrangements were soon made for inspecting the locality of a proposed line of telegraph through the island. Stewart hoped to see the work in progress during May, then to continue his tour to Bombay, and return in about two months later to Ceylon again. Before, however, leaving the island in the ordinary course of duty, the news of the Indian Mutiny hurried him down from Kandi to GaUe, and he received an urgent order to repair again to Calcutta with the least possible delay. Landing at Madras on his upward he had a long interview with Lord Harris, and took charge of important telegrams for Lord Canning; which had arrived from the Panjab and North-West, the telegraph line from Agra to Calcutta having been cut off at Cawnpore. It is not to be wondered at that before re-embarking he gave orders, on his own responsibility, to commence at once a coast line of telegraph from Madras to Calcutta, with a view of placing the two Presidencies in direct intercommunication at an early date. Although at Madras on the 9th June, he left Calcutta on the 18th for Benares, with the full confidence of the Governor-General that he would do his utmost for the restoration and maintenance of telegraphic communi cation at a time when its value was at the highest. A o little later he found himself at Allahabad, the only Engineer Officer available for consultation in all matters, civil and military ; with more work than sufficient for the day, and passing the night, when he could apply one to its natural purposes, in a palankeen carriage or thei.] MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 33 verandah of the garrison chapel. The difficulties in the way of any public operations were extraordinary, but happily so was the emergency which occasioned them. It was almost impossible to collect coolies in adequate number for the most trifling work. The march of a small body of troops towards Cawnpore, at a crisis of unparalleled emergency, was delayed for twelve hours from the want of lascars and dooly-bearers. Butchers to kill the meat had to be hunted for and coaxed into employment, as though the profession they fol lowed were a learned or scientific one. Even the ready low-caste hangman was wanting when required. Colonel Neill had been working day and night with insufficient assistance, and had ^et an example of spirit and energy which has now become a matter of history. It was reported that there were from 2,000 to 3,000 Mulvis collected at Mahgaon, distant 16 miles from Allahabad, and as Major Renaud's force was moving in that direction, Stewart thought the opportunity a good one for inspecting the line of telegraph and rendering general professional aid. He therefore proposed to ac company the detachment for the first day's march, retracing his steps on the day following, preparatory to starting for Benares. He had examined the railway buildings and workshops at Allahabad, and found the damage done by the rebels enormous. The locomotives, though repairable, were useless, since the appliances for putting them in order had been destroyed. He suggested to Colonel Neill that the next steamer passing Benares should be directed to take in tow a few country boats that were bringing up a complete new locomotive. It w as calculated that these craft were near Mirzapur, and D34 TELEGRAPTI AND TRAVEL. [chap. the engine, if brought up at once, must prove of im mense value. The last accounts then received of the telegraph lines to Cawnpore were somewhat discouraging. Stewart had not given full credit to the reports first circulated about them; but he had good reason to apprehend that wire might be wanting to enable him to open communication as General Havelock's force moved up. The river-boat with the first instalment on board could not arrive for a fortnight; and the small supply of wire available would not nearly meet the requirements, should the stories told of wholesale destruction prove true. He had persuaded the Commissioner to issue a proclamation that any person found in possession of telegraph wire or posts would be hanged, if the stores were not conveyed within two days to the nearest point of the road: and he could himself vouch that for seven miles along the line the measure had proved effective. Accompanying Major Renaud's force as arranged, on the 9th July, he returned to Calcutta, to hurry on the new coast line of telegraph. But before leaving that memorable month of June and the few days intervening, an extract from one of his home letters will form an appropriate introduction. It is dated the 21st July, the eve of a new departure from the Presidency for the North-West:— ' I came down from the North-West Provinces without scratch or accident of any kind, though I must confess to one or two providential escapes. I was to have breakfasted with poor Moore of the Civil Service at Gopar-ganj on the morning of his murder ; but, arriving a few hours earlier than I expected, thought it better to push on, without a halt, to Benares. He and his two friends were murdered when dressing for breakfast.i.] MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 35 Within six hours of my arrival in Allahabad I obtained Col.

And yet, some four short months ago, no single Kuropean would have believed one breath of all this I shall not unnecessarily expose myself; but believing, as I do, that it is the duty of every European who can give the slightest aid to be in the front in such times as these, nothing would induce me to remain in Calcutta.' During the six weeks or two months of this second expedition into the interior, he devoted himself to stem the tide of insurrection, applying his individual services in the cause to the best of his judgment and ability. A halt of General Havelock's force before he could join them, as he had hoped and intended, changed however his original plans. His chief work at this particular time, irrespective of the Telegraph, was the strong fortified position at Raj Ghat, commanding a passage of the Ganges by Benares. It is one that called forth high eulogium both from local authorities and the press. A friend bearing a well-known Indian name, who met and dined with him while engaged on the construction, writes in rapture of his host, describing him as ubiqui tous in spite of rheumatism, or, if stationary, unsparing of his exertions. Few of Stewart's own letters written at this time are extant; and this circumstance he after wards explains. The unfortunate difficulties which in Lower Bengal followed the mutiny of the Dinapur regiments almost entirely closed all communication between the North-West, where he then was, and Calcutta. Several of his letters, including a very impor-i.j MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 37 tant one to Lord Canning about the Benares fortifi cations, were forwarded for safety by a circuitous route, but the precaution had not availed to secure them from loss. Ihe Raj Ghat fortification originated in a recom mendation of Lieut. Stewart, to Lord Canning and Sir Patiick Grant, that this particular site should be chosen instead of one in the old Cantonments where intrench- ments had been commenced. The quick eye of the young Engineer had noted the particular facilities of defence offered by the position, four years before the Mutiny, and his views were now supported by the pro fessional experience of the senior officer directed to report on the proposal. The construction was sanctioned, and eventually undertaken by the originator himself, assisted by Lieut. Limond of his own corps, and several railway engineers. Controlling a host of workpeople, amounting sometimes to twelve thousand, they con structed in some six weeks, at a mere nominal cost, a fortified position of immense strength, capable of con taining, if necessary, 5,000 men, but easily defensible with a force of 350. Heavy guns, stores, ammunition, and provisions were thrown in, and every preparation made for a siege. Stewart's opinion that the security of Benares was indirectly attributable to this work, is well supported by the argument that its exposed position towards Oude would have made it an irresistible temp tation to an attacking army had there been a prospect of success. Stew art returned to Calcutta 011 the IGth September to hurry on the opening of the great coast line of tele graph connecting Madras and Ceylon with Calcutta, so essential to the controlling authorities at that disturbed38 TELEGRAPH AND TEA VEL. [chap. period. But before the end of the following month he was moving again towards the principal scene of insur rection. He accompanied General Windham for more than 300 miles, and then went on in advance to arrange ' O for transport at a part of the road where the Comman- der-in-Chief himself had nearly been taken by the muti neers. These last, on crossing the road, had stolen the horses from the Dak Station. On the 2nd November he was again at Allahabad, reporting himself en route, at Lord Canning s request, to join army head-quarters and accompany Sir Colin Campbell to Lucknow. He had arrived at the cantonment just as the guns were fired which announced the Chiefs departure, and he was to leave that evening for Cawnpore, in the hopes of meeting there the head-quarters staff. The occasion was one to him of the deepest interest. Lucknow was to be fully and effectually relieved; and he yearned to assist in the military engineering operations essential to the undertaking. He purposed, moreover, to establish, if possible, telegraphic communication from Cawnpore to the outpost of Alam-bagh, To his mind the relief of the Lucknow garrison, comprising so many of his personal friends, independently of its intrinsic importance, was, next to the capture of Delhi, the great desideratum of the war ; or, in other words, the one scene in this strange drama which he should the most prefer to witness. ; On the 3rd November, Stewart reached Cawnpore: on the 5th he had laid down a line of telegraph for 20 out of the 53 miles between Cawnpore and Lucknow., The story of the several and more or less effectual reliefs of Lucknow, during a period of unparalleled difficulty and danger, is recent, and comparatively wellr.J MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 39 known : but it should be borne in mind that there were three distinct opeicitions on this behcilf which cire not to be confounded together. The first relief was that by the troops under General Havelock on the 25th September 1857, among the more prominent incidents of which are, to use the language of the Despatches, the disintciestcd generosity of the valorous Outram in ceding a prerogative ot military command, and the death of the 'prompt and self-reliant' Neill. The second relief was that of the 16th and 17th November under Sir Colin Campbell, rendered memorable b}' daring feats of arms such as the attack on the Sikandar-bagh and storming the position of the Shah Najif. The third relief was the actual re-capture and re-occupation of the city effected in March 1858. It was to the second of these occasions that reference is now made. Attached to the head-quarters staff, Stewart had the great satisfaction of assisting in the operations which, however severe and attended with loss, obtained the rescue of the women and children, the sick and wounded, from their beleaguered and dangerous situation. In his Despatch of the 18th November to the Governor-General, the Commander-in-Chief, while calling special attention to the services of certain officers, does not fail to mention 'Lieutenant Stewart, Bengal En gineers, Superintendent of the Electric Telegraph, who accompanied the force ; and made himself particularly useful throughout.' A few days later, he was one of five officers who rode in with Sir Colin Campbell to Cawnpore, while the firing there was still heavy. The General s reception was a complete ovation, and Stewart shared in the enthusiasm exhibited for a leader who had inspired him with confidence as well as admiration.40 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. On the Gth December a decisive action occurred near Cawnpore: and he accompanied the horse artillery and cavalry in pursuit of the flying enemy to a distance of about 14 miles from camp, the Chief himself riding fore most of the party. On the 8th December he again returned to Calcutta, on urgent duty in connection with his important charge ; not, however, without eliciting an expression of regret at the loss of his immediate services on the part of the highest military authorities. The undertaking specially entrusted to him, indepen dently of general professional services and usefulness, was to carry the line of telegraph into the Alam-bagh, the entrenched garden rendered historical by Outram and his followers. This he performed successfully ; but no sooner did the opportunity offer than the rebels de stroyed his work. He moreover repaired the Cawnpore line on return to that station, and opened an office at the head-quarters camp, a position perhaps nearer to an enemy's guns than had ever before been occupied by telegraph officials at work. A round shot came into the very tent of the Superintendent himself, providen tially while the energetic young officer was absent on a, to him, not uncommon outdoor duty. The fact is, that, though nominally a telegraphist, he was at this time more often employed on military duties immediately connected with his own branch of the service. From the 16th to the 28th November, as may well be credited, there was no attempt whatever made at doing tele graph work, except in the case of a successful sema phore which had been planned to meet emergencies. Stewart's value and versatility were doubtless highly appreciated at this critical juncture. It is well authen ticated that the Chief habitually prefaced his orders toi.] MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 41 him by the stern injunction not to get shot, if he could help it! 1 A correspondent of the Bengal Hurkaru, who accom panied the camp, describes the Alam-bagh : 'It is a large garden enclosed by a brick wall about 10 feet high ; has circular bastions surmounted by cupolas at each angle, and a Moorish-looking gateway in the centre of the northern face. ... In the centre of the garden is a large, square, solid-looking building, of two storeys, with a terraced roof, on the top of which floats the meteor flag of Old England; and a semaphore, got up by Lieutenant Stewart of the Telegraph, rises thinly above the mass, the wooden arms of which, grotesque as their movements look, are speaking eloquent and cheering words to our beleaguered countrymen in Lucknow. Since our occupa tion of Alam-bagh its walls have been loopholed, earthen bastions thrown up in advance of the original ones, a banquette runs through the interior, a ditch and camp round the exterior, of the wall, and altogether the place is becoming a very defensible position.' These were doubtless times when there was great risk ot life and limb ; and though Stewart escaped unscathed, it was circumstantially reported that he had lost a leg by a round shot. The origin of this report he thought attiibutable to having been seen asleep on the ground on the night of the 16th September, when most of his dress below the waist was stained with blood. Thankful, however, as he had reason to be for immunity from the The Bengal Hurkaru states that permission to join the second Lucknow expedition was given to Lieutenant Stewart somewhat reluctantly, and was accompanied by a telegram from the Governor-General to the Commander- in-C hief that he ' was, if possible, not to be killed ! ' The paper adds : ^ir C olin read the order, and looking up, saw his object quietly slipping out with his rifle to join a party of skirmishers who expected hot work.

Returning to Calcutta from Cawnpore, just after the Gwalior force had been defeated and driven from the district, he was enabled to give Lord Canning details of all the more recent operations before any written accounts had come to hand. His reception at Government House was commensurate with the deep interest evinced by its distinguished inmates in the intelligence brought them. The loss of his horse during the severe fighting at Luck- now had entailed the loss of his diary, which, with other papers, had been put into the holsters attached to the saddle. That diary was the only record he possessed of all that had struck him as noteworthy during the two years preceding. Valuable as it must have been in the light of a private reference, it was perhaps of yet more importance professionally considered. He had to supply the deficiency by the best means available. At Lord Canning's request he drew out, and completed, plans illustrative of all the operations at or near Lucknow. Five copies of the connected Despatches, with seven plans attached to each, were forwarded to London for the Palace, the Horse Guards, and members of Government. The non-official way in which they were prepared will account for the omission of the draughtsman's name. On the 18th January, 1858, Sir William O'Shaugh-i.] MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. nessy, who had returned to Western India from Europe, addressed from Punah the following special telegram to the Secretary to Government in Calcutta :— ' I claim the privilege, as the head of the Telegraph Depart ment, to place on record an expression of the admiration and gratitude with which I regard the services rendered to Govern ment and the public, during my absence in Europe, by Lieutenant Patrick Stewart while officiating as Superintendent of Telegraphs in India. His indefatigable exertions, almost incessant move ments, and the gallant and scientific performance of his duties under every difficulty and danger, have been witnessed by the Governor-General and by his Excellency the Commander-in- Chief. It would be presumptuous in me to offer any definite suggestions as to the requital of his Oude services, but I will add my earnest hope that some substantial reward may be con ferred on Lieutenant Stewart, not only as an acknowledgment ot his great merit, but as an encouragement to others to follow the brilliant example he has set,' Lut Stewarts experience of active service during- the Indian ]\[utmies was not yet complete. The state of his health had hushed all reasonable expectation of moving from Calcutta until the departure of the English steamer in Apiil, when a sudden call acted like magic upon his eager nature. Lord Canning was about to leave the Iiesidency for the North-West, and the special talents and usefulness of the young Engineer were wanted. ersuading himself, and those for whom he had to exer cise persuasion, that his rest had been ample to admit of a new expedition up country, he was allowed to proceed to Allahabad, where he was for four days with the Governor-General considering an engineering project in which His Excellency was greatly interested. It was proposed to make Allahabad an immense military posi tion by constructing a chain of defensive works across44 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. the country between the Ganges and Jamna, some four miles above the Fort. The origin of this project was a memorandum drawn up by Lieutenant Stewart for General Havelock, with reference to the defences of Benares, Allahabad, and Mirzapur. But the extensive nature of the work had caused it to be put aside at a time when but a very small military force was available in India. It was now revived, as more applicable to the changed state of affairs. From Allahabad Stewart again joined army head-quarters, and was temporarily attached to the Staff by Sir Colin Campbell. Besides re-opening the telegraph to Alam-bagh, Stewart was entrusted with what he calls ' a glorious piece of mischief.' This was the destruction with gun powder of the whole of the temples and buildings on the bank of the Ganges immediately above the entrench ments at Cawiipore. Acts of this nature, however much, in ordinary times, they may merit the charge of Vandal ism, must be judged by the circumstances under which they are sanctioned. The Indian Mutiny was not a common occurrence, nor had the Indian mutineer shown himself amenable to the treatment recognized by an enlightened civilization for common offenders. The author of the ' Diary in India,' to whom the public is indebted for two most interesting volumes, which will long live to tell the tale of these days of trial and danger, became associated about this period with Lieutenant Stewart. Under the auspices of the Governor- General's own introduction, they travelled together from Allahabad to Cawnpore, and there occupied adjacent tents in the camp. The fact is noted to draw the reader's attention to the book in question, especially to those passages bearing upon the subject of this memoir.i.] MEMOIR OF COLONEL FAT LUCK STEWART. 45 These will, at least, prove ' Pat Stewart' to be no equivocal or second-rate hero :— 'Never since its discovery,' writes the Correspondent of the Times, ' has the electric telegrapli played so important and daring a rdle as it now does in India. Without it the Com mander-in-Chief would lose the effect of half his force. It has served him better than his right arm. By it he is enabled to direct the march of his battalions, the movements of his artillery and cavalry, to receive news of their successes, to survey, as it were, at any one time the whole position of his army and of its auxiliaries, to communicate with the Governor-General and with his subordinate generals, to sift the truth from the falsehood of native information, to learn what posts are likely to be threatened, where the enemy are in force, to spare his staff and his messengers, and yet to send messages with clearness and despatch. So much for its-importance. As to the daring action of the telegraph, which includes of course those who direct it, I need only observe that in this war, for the first time, a tele graph wire has been carried along under fire and through the midst of a hostile country. Pari .passu, from post to post it has moved on with our artillery, and scarcely has the Com mander-in-Chief established his head-quarters at any spot where he intended to stay for a few days when the post and the wire were established also. The telegraph was brought into com munication with the Governor-General at Allahabad, with Outiam at the Alam-bagh, with Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, and the most remote districts over which the system is distributed. It is mainly to the zeal, energy, and ability of a young officer of the Bengal Engineers, Lieutenant Patrick Stewart, that these advantages are due. He is assisted, it is true, by a few men, but he it is who devises and superintends the execution and the extension of the line from place to place. At one time his men are chased for miles by the enemy's cavalry—at another time they are attacked by the Sowars, and they and the wires are cut to pieces again, their electric batteries are smashed by the fire of a gun, or their cart knocked to pieces by a round shot; but still they work on, creep over arid plains, across watercourses,46 „ TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. . [ciiAr. ~y span rivers and pierce jungles, till one after another tlie rude poles raise aloft their slender burden, and the quick needle vibrates with its silent tongue amjd the thunder of the artillery. While Sir C. Campbell was at Cawnpore he could learn from Sir James Outram the results of an attack before the enemy had disappeared from the field. As he advanced towards Lucknow, the line was carried with or soon after him; a tent was pitched near his, a hole was dug in the ground and filled with water, and down dropped the wire from the pole stuck up in haste, dived into the water otter-like, the simple magnet was arranged, the battery set in play, and at once the steel moved responsive to every touch. Owing to the extreme dryness of the atmosphere and the power of the sun, which at this season bakes the earth like a brick, the insulation of the current is nearly complete. The wire is thick, and is not protected by non conductive coatings of any kind; it is twisted round the top of-a rude pole, fifteen or sixteen feet high, and, under ordinary states of the atmosphere, it is found to answer per fectly. We had not been very long in the Dilkusha ere we saw T , in dim perspective, the line of posts advancing towards us, and soon the wire was slipped into one of the drawing-room windows, and now it is at full work, surrounded by all the shattered splendour of the palace, inquiring after the Ghoorkas, asking for more of something or other, exchanging ideas be tween Sir Colin and Lord Canning, or flurrying along a news paper message to yourself, amid the whistle ot the bullet, the roar of the round shot, and all the feverish scenes of war. To stivte a plain case practicallyj and from Stewart's own official data, the line of telegraph constructed from Cawnpore to Alam-bagh, in November, 1857, having been almost entirely destroyed, and the recovered portion of the wire applied to other purposes, its reconstruction a few weeks later was no easy matter. On the 17th February, 1858, during reconstruction, an office was opened at about 34 miles from Cawnpore for convenience- ;.] MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 47 \ of communication between the military camps. On the 19th, the line was completed, and a second office'opened in General Ou tram's camp at Alam -bagh. On the following day, the first office having been closed, a new one was substituted at 2G miles from Cawnpore. On the 26th February, the last was closed and one opened near the Alam-bagh camp, which remained at work up to the 3rd March. On the 4th March, the native work ing party delayed progress by panic and flight, but on the Gth an office was opened in the advanced position of the Dilkusha at T^ucknow. On the 8th, an expres sion of the Chief's wishes caused immediate construction of a double-armed semaphore for work on the spot, and despatch of a second to General Outram, Stewart him self preparing the code and proceeding to the latter General 's camp to superintend arrangements. Thouo-h nothing was done with this semaphore, owing to circum stances arising during the progress of the general assault on Lucknow, the occupation of the Martiniere pending organization enabled one of the telegraph officers to set up the line to that station with great rapidity. On the 10th, the line was carried to General Outram's head- quarters, and a third office opened in the Lucknow camp on the day following. On the 12th the head -quarters office was removed from the Martiniere to a tent, for the convenience of the Commander-in-Chief. The Alam- bagh office, which had been uninterruptedly at work since the 19th February, was closed on the 18th March. In the report from which these details are gathered, the writer, while naturally diffident in speaking of the extent to which the electric telegraph manifestly aided the Lucknow operations, has no hesitation in declaring that the result of its application in this particular and very48 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. remarkable instance proves how extensively it may- assist all military operations, especially those of an offen sive character on a large scale. The few years which have elapsed since the third relief of Lucknow have sufficed to organize a special system of military tele graphy, and to test its successful use in European warfare. But it is questionable whether its appliances and disci pline, if brought to bear upon the Oude campaigns, would have surpassed in effectiveness the rough and ready resources of Patrick Stewart and his energetic assistants. A strong will, a noble example, and a good cause, have a wonderful power of attaining adequacy, without the prescience to grasp at coming inventions. No modern science could enhance the glories of Ther mopylae. Taking part in the third as well as second advance upon Lucknow, ' Lieutenant P. Stewart of Engineers, Superintendent of Electric Telegraphs,' was honourably named, with many gallant companions, in the Governor- General's order of the 5th April, 1858, recording that 'from the 2nd to the 16th March, a series of masterly operations took place, by which the Commander-in-Chief, nobly supported in his well-laid plans of attack by the ability and skill of the general officers and men of all arms, drove the whole successfully from all their strongly fortified posts, till the whole fell into the possession of our troops.' The thanks of the Chief for this new service had been already publicly tendered to him in his despatch to the Governor-General from the Martiniere. Fuller but not more valued personal tributes are not wanting in the records of the day. A friend, writing to Scotland from Calcutta on the 18th March, reports that a telegram of the previous night had come in fromi .J MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 49 Lucknow certifying Pat Stewart's health: that the rebels were leaving the city in large numbers, pursued by cavalry and horse artillery, and, for the particular satisfaction of well-wishers, that ' Pat' was tied down to his telegraphs and duties at head-quarters, and could not therefore follow them. The Times Correspondent, writing on the 20th March, or two days before date of the Martini^re despateh, states :— ' Lieutenant P. Stewart, the indefatigable officer of the Bengal Engineers, who has had charge of our venturesome electric telegraphs, and their odd branches from the Martini&amp;re, Dilk- usha, Banks'-house, and the Alara-bagh, to all over the world, is about to leave by next mail for England on account of ill- health.' And so indeed it was. On the 9th April, Stewart left India and returned to England. Still a young man, and comparatively of short service, his five to six years of an Indian career had been sufficiently active to count twice the time of an ordinary garrison life. He needed a change homeward, and certainly deserved it. He would leave work behind him ; but there were soldiers more than enough for its accomplishment. The fires of the rebellion had not been wholly extinguished, but they were now rather scattered and smouldering than fierce and continuous. The great events of Delhi and Luck- now had passed into the pages of history. Such work as loomed in the prospect was of a less momentous cha racter, and foreshadowed rather retribution and repara tion than battle and resistance. The second chapter of the great Indian Mutiny was without the horrors or the struggles of the first. The good opinion of Lieutenant Stewart, expressed both publicly and privately by the Governor-General and KTELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. Indian officials of rank and influence, secured him a warm reception from many high and notable personages at home. What with dinners, balls, receptions, con ferences, and ceremonies, his time was tolerably well occupied for at least the London season. He found time, however, to run down to Plymouth and join the expedition proceeding thence, in June, 1858, to lay the Atlantic cable, as attested by a letter dated the eve of departure onboard of H.M.S. Agctmemnon, At the close of the year his attention was specifically drawn to two questions on which information was required by the State. One was the applicability to Indian Telegraphy of certain instruments manufactured in Prussia : the other bis own employment on the Turk ish Asiatic land lines, which it was in contemplation to extend to the Persian Gulf. His professional experience and practical intelligence were brought to bear, without loss of time, on the first of these matters. Instruments, descriptions, and plans were reported on and despatched to India; and Stewart returned from his second official visit to Berlin on the 28th January, 1859, bearing letters to Windsor Castle which had preceded by a few hours only the telegram announcing the birth of the young Prince Frederick William. Complimented on delivering his despatches in thirty-eight hours after receipt, it is no reflection on professional or amateur messengers to say, that owing to unforeseen obstacles, Stewart had really performed a feat of couriership. Left behind by the express at Oberhausen, he had to make the best of his way across country to Aix to recover his place in it. In this he succeeded, but with the loss of his passport and Calais ticket, which forced him to turn oft to Bruges and cross from Ostend. Eventually his lettersi.) MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 51 were delivered two hours earlier than expected, and not a moment of delay was caused by his misadventures. As regards the second question, so much will have to be said by and by about the Turkish Telegraph, it will suffice to state in this place that an officer of Her Majesty's service was then engaged in assisting the Imperial Ottoman Government in the construction of their Asiatic lines ; that it was under consideration to send out a second officer for the furtherance of the same work ; but that Major Stewart was not destined to take any active part in first organizing and establishing this particular section of the Indo-European Telegraph. Stewart had been made a Brevet-Major, in acknow ledgment of his Indian services, on the 28th August, 1858, the day after attaining his Captaincy. He had been fortunate in regimental promotion. Promoted from Second to First Lieutenant in less than two years after landing in India, he became a Captain in barely four years afterwards. During the year 1859 he had a severe attack of sick ness which necessitated correspondingly severe treatment. He had never seemed to recover wholly from the fall in the Panjab in December, 1854, and to this he attributed much indirect subsequent suffering. Though restored to comparative health, under the best medical advice, his physical condition was not such as to relieve his friends from anxiety, and it became a matter of serious considera tion whether India was not an unsuitable climate for him. His wonted energy soon, however, dispelled all doubts on future proceedings. Recovery from temporary depression biought with it new determination to exert usefulness whenever and wherever it found a field. No wonder, then, that he was authoritatively instructed while at E 252 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

He had also to report on the submarine cable prepared by Government for connecting Gibraltar with England direct ; and to con sider, in minute detail, a proposal for telegraphic com munication at Malta. In August, 1860, Stewart married, and in November left England, with his bride, for the East again. The outward overland journey was rendered more than usually interesting by a diversion through the valley ol the Rhine and Geneva, to Marseilles, from which port they embarked on the 29th November. Before the dawn of the new year they had reached Calcutta. It was the intention of Government at this time to lay a cable from India towards China, and Stewart, who had been selected to superintend operations, would await at Calcutta news of the despatch of the Singapoic section, which he would then hasten to meet at Penang. But circumstances changed, and accidents occurred, and the scheme never ripened into fulfilment. Months passed in expectation of the promised expedition : but at last came a countermand, and Stewart was detained in Calcutta until after the rains on other duty. New Government offices were required at the Presidency, and he was entrusted with drawing out the plans. In September, he was appointed with four others to a special commis sion for ascertaining the cause of the great mortality from cholera. In the prosecution of this inquiry they visited Agra, Delhi, Ambalah, Amritsar, Lahor, Gwalior;r j MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 53 also Simla, and neighbouring hill stations; returning to send in their results in Jan. 1862, The report was of a comprehensive character, and had in view the means of improving the sanitary condition of the soldier in India. Scarcely had this labour been completed when orders were received to depute Major Stewart to Persia on a particular mission connected with the construction of a proposed Telegraph in that country. As a separate chapter of this volume has been reserved for the history of the Persian lines, and as the remainder of the short but brilliant career of the above lamented officer was mainly devoted to the furtherance of Indo-European telegraphic communication, to which the said Persian lines would contribute a respectable quota, and the true history of which, so far as carried out under Govern ment orders, is the main intent of this whole work, the interval between Stewart's final departure from Calcutta and his fatal illness at Constantinople will be rapidly sketched, to avoid repetition. Leaving Calcutta in February, and Ceylon, after some two or three weeks' detention, in March, he proceeded via Bombay and Karachi to the Persian Gulf, disem barking at Bushahr, and journeying to Tehran by land. Sickness drove him from Tehran on the 18th June, and he at once went home through Russia. After recruiting his health in England under the drawback of incessant official duty, and completing the arrangements for the Persian Gulf cable with which he was entrusted as the responsible head, he proceeded to Bombay in November 18G3, laid the cable from Gwadar to Fao, and returned from the Persian Gulf to Bombay, thence to establish temporary head-quarters at Constantinople. He arrived here in the summer of 1864. Thenceforward, except to54 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap.

A young and highly-accomplished officer of the scientific branch of the army, whose name Is familiar as a household word in India and promised to be equally celebrated in Europe, Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick Stewart of the Royal Engineers, has breathed his las after three weeks of almost continual suffering.

Under these circumstances Colonel Stewart returned to India from Baghdad in April 1864. ' After making his arrangements in Bombay he embarked for Egypt and Constantinople, landing at Galata in July. From that time to the hour of his sickness he has been constantly engaged in urging the Ottoman authorities to organize at least one thoroughly efficient wire for the Anglo-Indian telegraphic service. In the first instance his attention was given to certain amendments in their Asiatic lines, inspected and re-inspected by British officers ; to placing a competent staff of clerks and signallers along that line sufficiently acquainted with English to prevent a recurrence of the absurd mistakes heretofore com mitted by the misuse of that language and incorrect transla tions; and to framing a full convention with the Turkish Government which would meet all future requirements on the subject of international telegraphic communication. It then appeared that, while perfecting the Asiatic system, there was danger of deterioration on the European side. Attention was consequently drawn to the Danubian and Adriatic lines of Turkey. But a Turkish office is not like an English one. Several cigarettes have to be smoked, and several formal visits have to be got through, before the actual entry into business can be at tempted ; and in nine cases out of ten, even after business has been fairly begun, nothing results except under strong pressure. Ihe lirst stage of inertion got over, the next one is a question ot personal interests. It is the last stage only which can be considered the truly successful one, where something like punishment and degradation is held out in terror era. 11 Colonel Stewart had an able assistant in Major Champain, a brother officer of Engineers. This gentleman has held charge of the Persian line of telegraph, which, branching off from the 1 urkish line at Baghdad, takes a long course to the Persian Gulf through Tehran, and joins the Indian Sea cable at Bushahr. 'Ihe completion of this alternative line would render the failure between Baghdad and Basrah of comparatively little im portance, for the correspondence would then have effect from ■■ HJir f 1 j56 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. Constantinople to Baghdad, from Baghdad to Buslialn, and fiom Bushahr—by submarine cable—to Gwadar or Karachi, at either of which places is a terminus of the Indian system. Hie difficulties which the above-named officer has had to encounter with the Persian authorities in achieving his important work are simply indescribable; but he managed to carry his point, and this route has already been declared open. It is not too much to say that devotion to his young chief has been a great element of Major Champains success in a work ot as much moral as physical obstruction. ' Nine months ago Patrick Stewart had fervently hoped to have completed one of these two lines of Indian telegraphic communication. His own fair share of the work he had done was publicly acknowledged by admission to the Order of the Bath. He had brought Bright's wondrous sea cable himself to the head of the Persian Gulf, and joined it to the fragment of land line found at Fao ; as far back as 1862 he had surveyed the Persian land line from Bushahr to Tehran. The rest was a political battle, which the director of the Anglo-Indian Tele graph was hardly called upon to fight, lhat he did fight it in conjunction with our diplomatists is owing to the accurate knowledge that he possessed of all details of diplomatic diffi culty connected with these questions, as well as to the winning intelligence which made him the desired companion and co adjutor of public men, whatever their rank or station. ' But in serving the State as a true and loyal soldier, at the desk as in the field, he overtaxed his energies. Sharp and severe Indian sicknesses, constant warnings ot danger from fevers which pursued him to Europe, daily-increasing sensitive ness in matters of duty—here were reasons, not only for relaxa tion, but temporary cessation from labour. He had not been really well for many weeks, but he could not be persuaded to quit Constantinople, which he seemed to consider for the time the post of honour. It was, in fact, the central point for a joint European and Asiatic line on the eve of completion, and espe cially favourable for watching and correcting defects when once the working had begun. Besides, there is no disguising the fact that the mal-administration of Turkish telegraphs called for ther i.J MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 57 closest observation and care in the early operations of the Indian line. But this was not all. He had at length made up his mind to leave the place, but must delay for one more interview at the Porte to obtain some further concessions, with a view to the future security of his undertaking. This interview, though a day had been fixed, never had effect. About Christ mas he was seriously ill. On the 28th of December his malady assumed the form of cerebral affection. A pernicious inter mittent fever supervened, followed by a complication of dis orders. The medical officers pronounced the case a difficult one, owing to the previous condition of the patient. The strain upon the mental powers had been too great, and the physical powers were generally disorganized. The best advice procur able was obtained. Those persons who know Constantinople will readily remember the names of Zohrab, Millingen, Fauvel, and Dickson, all of whom attended in consultation on the case, Drs. Millingen and Fauvel being present at the more critical' periods. All was in vain. It was the Almighty's will that the young soldier should die—not on the visible field of battle, but on one not wanting in glory. On the morning of the 16th of January he ceased to exist; and on the day following he was accompanied to his grave by more than one sincere mourner A residence of some months at Constantinople had secured him many true friends here as elsewhere. He rests in Scutari about fifty yards from the monument to the Crimean heroes— an honourable resting-place, which he himself had visited in ealth during the milder season. His age was thirty-two. t is not my intention to describe Colonel Stewart's Indian career The task is worthy of fitter pens than mine. Mr Kussell's 'Diary in India' has already thrown a light upon ie theme.

[chap. high order of intellect and varied acquirements, he was modest and retiring in urging any claims to personal benefit or ad vantage. His extraordinary zeal in the public service, Mhile it led him sometimes into the natural error of believing all others with whom he had to do possessed of the same British energy and liberal -mindedness, never caused him to overtax those em ployed under him. . In this respect his great consideration was a remarkable feature in so young a man. A high authority, writing since his death, will forgive me for using his most appropriate words' So much knowledge, intelligence, earnest ness, kind-heartedness, and winning simplicity can rarely be united in the same person, and in him there was no other side of the picture.' 'Not many days ago the Persian minister at tins Court received a telegram reporting the completion of the Persian line from Baghdad to Bushahr. Another report showed the Basrah line to be also just completed, thanks to the exertions of Colonel Kemball, our Consul-General. Immediate tele graphic communication with India may, therefore, be expected. These facts were communicated to Colonel Stewart, when his fate was still doubtful. But the lamp was nearly out; their importance, if appreciated at all, was not to him what it had been. The spirit was soaring to a less worldly region than that of human science or effort.' The testimony to Stewart's public services of the dis tinguished nobleman who ruled India in her most critical period is not confined to public letters or orders. It might be superfluous to quote non-official records in support of this particular assertion ; but there is among these an expression, bearing On private worth, the felicity of wliuli will plead excuse for publication. The late Lord ( anning, while foretelling a brilliant career to the young officer, adds; 'and there is no one with such pleasant good manners, or more agreeable society, or more unspoiled. He was 'unspoiled' because he had a fixed purpose of being useful to his generation ; and all steps in the Oi.j MEMOIR OF COLONEL PATRICK STEWART. 59 ladder of his ambition were steps towards that end. Had lie allowed himself to be swayed by self -eonceit, to lose want of consideration for his fellows, to prefer self to duty ; had he turned aside from his chosen path to seek a pastime in actual vice or a study in spurious virtue, he would have marred the one object in view, which was essentially ( hristian in its comprehensiveness. This quality of conscience, as much perhaps as rare energy and ability, made him not only what is called a rising man, but kept him &lt;£ unspoiled ' as he rose. In lasting token of respect and regard, no less than three memorials have been raised to Patrick Stewart since his death. One is the tomb at Scutari, one a sub scription window and bust in the telegraph library at Karachi, and one a subscription window in the family church at Minnigaff, near Newton Stewart. urrary, with stewart memorial window, at karachi.CHAPTER II. PRELIMINARY ARRANGEMENTS IN ASIATIC TURKEY. NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE OTTOMAN GOVERNMENT. The practical progress of the Electric Felegrapli dmiiig^ the last thirty years illustrates, in a remarkable manner, the rapidity with which development follows an impor tant discovery of science. A miniature line of land telegraph, set up on the four miles of Black wall railway in 1840, however limited its operation, was so successful that, in 1845, roadside wires had lost their novelty in England; and while speculations in the American press foreshadowed the great event of the Atlantic cable, a proposal was actually submitted in the course of that year to the British prime minister of the day, 1 for a joint land and sea telegraph of more than one thousand times the extent of the Blackwall experiment. By such mixed telegraph, communication was to be established with India via France, Sardinia, Malta, and Alexandria. No active measures immediately attended this early introduction of a topic which, to say the least, must have been, at the time, startling in its strangeness. Reference 1 Sir Robert Peel: ' Correspondence respecting the Establishment of Telegraphic Commnnications in the Mediterranean and with India,' page 78, line 10.chap. ii.] PRELIMINARY STEPS. (51 to the Parliamentary Blue Jiooks shows, however, that not ten years afterwards, or on the 28th Sept. 1854, Mr. Lionel Gisborne put forward the project of a sub marine telegraph from Constantinople to Alexandria, as a preliminary step to a telegraph to India ; that on the 12th December, 1 854, the projector was invited by the Porte, through Lord Clarendon, to discuss the question at Constantinople ; and that on the 23rd April, 1855, a concession 1 was granted to the same gentleman for the construction of a telegraph from the Dardanelles to Alexandria, the Porte binding itself to complete the link between the Dardanelles and Constantinople. In con nection with this scheme, which fell through in its original design from adverse influences to which similar under takings must, in a greater or less degree, be subject, arose the European and Indian Junction Telegraph Com pany,' whose prospectus was issued on the 19th July 18.55 , and, as a sequel to it, the ' Red Sea Telegraph Company,' ofticially announced on the 29th August 1857. Hie argument of the present chapter involves abandon ment of the general question in its detail. We have to trace the origin and progress of the negotiations opened by her Majesty's Government with the Sublime Porte for establishing a land telegraph throughout the length of the Sultan's Asiatic dominions, to unite England and India. To carry out this purpose many scattered Blue Books and many scattered printed and manuscript papers must be consulted. The story of the Submarine Cable will be told with equal minuteness, but its disentangle ment from the records is a much simpler affair: nor need the EstabIishment of Telegraphic Com- li ne 14 ,n the M ^'terranean and with India,' page 70. from top totelegraph and travel. [chat. the chronicler of its formation and utilisation search lor his data elsewhere than in the shelves of the India Office and tributary departments. It is by no means strange that the first mention ot international negotiation betwixt England and Turkey for a telegraph to India should be found recorded in the annals of 1856. The alliance cemented by the ( rimean war, and the enhanced value resulting from that war to telegraphic communication as a State requirement, would alone have ensured favourable reception by British diplomatists of a scheme to render available the vast Ottoman territory between Belgrade and Basrah, for a line of posts and wires in connection with an Indian sub marine cable. Later, however, causes arose to give fresh impetus to the demand for an Anglo-Indian telegrap i , and the Indian Mutiny of 1857, and failure of the Red Sea Cable in 1859, made it more than ever urgent to investigate and determine the lines otiering the best advantages to telegraphic communication between Western Europe and the Persian Gulf. In August 1856, when cables, and companies for the construction and use of cables, were not so numerous as at present, the European and Indian Junction Telegraph Company applied to the then existing Court of Direc tors of the East India Company for a guarantee on an estimated expenditure of 200,000/. for a line of land telegraph from Seleucia, or Suadiah, on the Syrian coast, to Korna, at the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates. 1 The link, if successfully completed and worked, would have rendered comparatively facile a 1 Mr. Andrew to the Secretary, East India Company, August 5, 18.)6 .

For, to join a port on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean with the French system at Marseilles or the Italian system at Brindisi, would have presented no special difficulty to submarine telegraphy; and a successfully working Persian (Jult cable has long since become an established fact. 1 hat tins, if not the truest direct route to India, is nearer the mark than any which has been hitherto before the public, whether for telegraph or iailu a}, cannot even now be doubted by any unpre judiced person who has taken the trouble to master the subject in detail; and that it will be found so, before the speculation and enterprise of the present age shall have given place to new characteristics of progressive civiliza tion, there is ample ground for belief. The question for decision seems to be whether or no the mouth of the Orontes is the fittest starting-point for rail and wire intended to connect the Mediterranean with the Persian Gulf? And here we may well pause to reflect whether too little attention has not in this respect been bestowed on the Syrian ports below Seleucia, on the Palmyra desert, and on the desert post-track between Damascus and Baghdad ? Hie notion of an Indian telegraph through Asiatic I urkey had, at this time, been just interpreted, more or less comprehensively, to the East India Company by Dr. 0 Shaughnessy, Superintendent of Indian Telegraphs. 1 Tins officer, arguing in favour of a direct line of tele graph to connect Karachi with Constantinople, proposed to lay a cable from the former place to Korna, to con tinue thence subaqueous communication to Baghdad 1 ' Correspondence respecting the Establishment of Telegraphic Commnni- cations in the Mediterranean and with India,' pages 118 to 124,64 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. and to construct a land line between Baghdad and Scutari vid Mosul, Diarbekir, Sivas, Amasia, and Tokat In a second letter he suggested a modification of no small importance. This was to substitute for the long land line through Asia Minor a series of subaqueous cables m the Euphrates, and a subterraneous telegraph between the Euphrates and Seleucia, connecting the hitter port by- submarine cable with the European system. 1 he feasi bility of the modified project never having been tested, it might be premature to condemn it unreservedly but the most recent experience will hardly bring icsi arguments in favour of its revival. .mi To return to the European and Indian Junction e e- graph Company. The Court of Directors were not un willing to join her Majesty's Government m subsidising and otherwise promoting the success of the propose line, but diplomatic action was too hampered and fettered to be made availing to the accomplishment of the fele- araph Company's wishes. Doubtless, it is often easier for the astute diplomatist to conduct an intricate negotia tion on behalf of that Government whose interests lie represents, than to plead the ordinary case of a private company or individual by virtue of mere official position at the court from which some special assent is awaited. The objections of the Porte to make the concessions re- nuired were accompanied with an express resolve to undertake the work on its own account. Mr. Andrew, Chairman of the Telegraph Company, rightly estimating the public importance of the proposed scheme, but under valuing the professions and resources of Turkey, presset a renewal of negotiations, on the ground that the Firman be sought could alone ensure the existence of a satis factory line of communication as regards construction.ii.] ARRANGEMENTS IN ASIATIC TURKEY. maintenance, and working. 1 Matters had indeed gone so far that Lieutenant J1 awes, an ofhcer of tlie BengaJ army, had been specially deputed on a mission to Baghdad, to take measures on behalf of the company, for commencing the work which they had engaged to perform. And the official report to the Secretary of the Treasury of this gentleman's departure on his mission bears date the day previous to that on which Lord Stratford telegraphed home news of the rejection by the Ottoman Council of the Company's proposals. 2 In September 1857, however. Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, while verifying the validity of the Porte's former decision, informed Lord Clarendon that a wire would be made over to the British Government, with liberty to appoint British agents, workmen, and direc tors.' Thus the concession withheld from a private company meant no want of harmony with the enlight- ened objects of a friendly State : and as further token ot good intentions, a formal application was made by the 1 urkish minister in the January following for the services of Lieutenant-Colonel Biddulph of the Royal Artillery. ' An expression of willingness before notified, to employ English engineers in carrying out the opera tions, was moreover repeated. Compliance in both cases on the part of her Majesty's Government was natural under the circumstances. Great social and political changes have taken place, hoth in the East and West, since the Crimean war ; and 1 Mr. Andrew to Mr. Hammond, September 18, 1857 : ' Correspondence respecting the Establishment of Telegraphic Communications in the Medi terranean and with India,' pages 193, 194. 5 Ibid, pages 142 and 144. 3 Ibid. p. 194.

Without entering into an analysis of profit and loss during this interval, or looking beyond the narrow limits of a Telegraph history, it may be safely asseited that, externally, her relations with Oriental powers, such as Turkey and Persia, have been simplified ; while, internally, an administrative spirit has arisen out of commercial activity, to stimulate, or, it it fail to stimu late, to complicate the routine-tied administration of established Government. After the peace of March 1856, the remainder of the year may be considered a period of comparative repose and reaction in Europe. To England, moreover, there flickered in the distance o 7 the flame of a little war just kindled in Persia, which, however pale when contrasted with the red fires of Sebastopol, revealed an incident of much political method and meaning. In Turkey, at least, matters were then much as they were and had been for years before the Crimean war. For the Ottoman Empire, the transition state, if indeed begun, had exercised no perceptible in fluence. Progress, in its accepted sense of fusion of East into West, was more a promise and a semblance than a plain, incontrovertible fact : it was yet unwise and unsafe to bridge over by anticipation a gap which precedent would not admit of traversing without the warrant of Time ; and although in these more recent days a few months may do the work of years, yet those few months are all the more indispensable from fulness of significance. In plain words, Turkey was not so Europeanized in 1857-8 as she has become in 1870. 1 1 Had this volume been of a political character, allusion to later signs and results might have been appropriately added. As it is, the passage remains as written more than three years ago.ii.] ANCIENT SITES AND MODERN SYSTEMS. 67 At such a time, then, few British officers but would feel the construction of a telegraph in Asia Minor and Mesopotamia, dependent on the aid and subject to the approval of the Ottoman Government, to be a task of no small responsibility and difficulty. Ready to allow liberally for the natural difference of character between European and Asiatic, and with the best intentions of discouraging and barring access to every dangerous impulse peculiar to the former, the most patient and conciliatory mind would still be sorely tried in an isolation with which' there could be no authori tative sympathy. It must be borne in mind that, at the period to which reference is now made, the Telegraph was as strange amid the tumuli of Nineveh and plains around Babylon as in the ancient days of splendour and greatness acknowledged for those cities. It is only within the last very few years that the inhabitants of modern Assyria and Chaldaea have not only become reconciled to these practical posts and wires, but have learnt to look on them as familiar and every-day objects. The officer named for the particular duty in question commenced active work in August 1858. Prostrated by a malignant fever which attacked his whole small staff, and'disappointed in obtaining the support from the Ottoman administration on which success mainly depended, he shortly resigned the two first sections of his charge, retaining only the lower portion below Baghdad; and in February, 1859, applied for leave of absence. This step was followed in the same year by total withdrawal from the Superintendence. Colonel Biddulph's report 1 of breaking ground is on record. It shows the progress made up to October 1859 1 To Sir H. Eawlinson, K.C.B., dated Constantinople, October 0, 185!).TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

That as much had been done as could reasonably have been expected, in a short time and amid serious difficulties, was the formally expressed opinion of high authority in submitting the case to the Secretary of State for India. The work was continued by Mr. Carthew and two brothers named MacCallum, all retired non-commissioned officers of Artillery, who had been members of the original party, a staff which did not, at any time, contain more than eleven Englishmen. To the first named was entrusted construction of the line between Mosul and Basrah, in fulfilment of which trust he arrived, with four assistants, at Baghdad in July 1859. 1 The other Superintendents were engaged in the prolongation of the line already commenced in Asia Minor, eastward to Sivas, and thence southward towards Diarbekir and Mosul. In addition to the report above mentioned, a valuable paper by Colonel Biddulph, throwing light on the history of the Turkish Asiatic Telegraph, and attached by the author to an elaborate map illustrative of his subject, has been printed. Divesting the pamphlet of personal matter, the introduction of which was unavoidable under the circumstances, its perusal will amply repay the interested reader. The view taken of the future of the Turkish Asiatic lines, if perhaps a shade too dark and gloomy, has not proved so mistaken as to throw discredit on the writer's discri- 1 Major Kemball to her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, dated Baghdad, July 20, 1859.ii.] WANT OF SUPERINTENDENT FOR ASIATIC LINES. G9 mination and foresight; and the map boasts a character of usefulness and importance in marked contrast to the ordinaiy illustrative accompaniments to telegraph schemes of the day. Here it may be remarked, en passant, that the reckless manner in which Mercators, or the village schoolboy's World, has been subjected to the vaguest tracings of imaginary telegraph lines, to suit the purposes of promoters and speculators, however indirectly it may have led inquirers to a heretofore neglected study of geography, cannot be said to have imparted the wanting knowledge by any teaching of its own. As stated in the preceding chapter, there had been some intention of employing Major Stewart in the con struction of this long line of telegraph. Independently of the question of individual fitness, it appears that the services of an officer then in India had been applied for to assist Colonel Biddulph ; and that an objection to withdraw officers from Indian stations had caused attention to be directed to the discovery of an eligible substitute at home. Patrick Stewart's name naturally suggested itself to the authorities. His state of health 'was, however, a bar to unconditional acceptance of service in Asia, and as a loan to a foreign administra tion ; and it was, perhaps, well for him that a reference on his account to Constantinople went the way of many similiar missives, and became obsolete before obtaining the favour oi a reply. Major Stewart did not go out at all, and Colonel Biddulph, as above shown, felt himself compelled to resign the work of telegraph construction in Asiatic lurkey at the very outset. A later chapter in this volume will be given to the authors.own experience of the country traversed by the7U TBLEOBAPH AND TRAVEL. [CHAP- Indo -Ottoman telegraph ; and as this experience will bear more upon general than departmental questions, the reader will understand the exclusion of the former under the present head. The object is now to place on record the causes which have produced the means of telegraphic communication up to this time existing m Asiatic Turkey ; and to let the public judge who, il anv- one, is fairly responsible if such means have not proved sufficient or satisfactory. For facility of geographical reference, the line trom Scutari to Baghdad may be shown under three heads :— 1. Scutari to Sivas, or the Asia Minor section; about 500 miles. 2. Sivas to Jazireh, or the West of Eupliratos and Upper Mesopotamia section, about 430 miles ; so called because the Euphrates crosses the post road from the East 140 miles below Sivas ; and, by miming a parallel course with the Tigris some distance further down, helps to enclose a great portion of the Diarbekir pashalik, in which the line runs. Jazireh to Baghdad, or the East ot 1 igris seetion, about 400 miles. 1 The first of these sections is difficult in its moun tains, ravines and forests. The second is free from forests, but not being confined to the high table-land of Asia Minor, contains, together with its mountains, laiiv tracts of plain country, and thus presents ascents ami i Lieut.-Colonel Goldsiuid to Lieut.-Colonel Patrick Stewart. daUni IVw.

The third section is, for the most part, in low land, or amid low ranges of hills studding or overhanging the valley of the Upper Tigris. While the first two sections were of a character to tax severely the judgment as well as perseverance of the constructing engineer, the third section was perhaps the one most likely to be interrupted after construction. It was more open and exposed, and more subject to the influence of storms and freshets. We gather from the earlier reports on this interesting and difficult work, that the general direction of the line was determined upon 'from a rough outline furnished by Omar Pacha to the Ottoman Telegraph administra tion, having straight lines drawn joining the towns of Scutari, Izmid, Angora, Yuzgat, Sivas, Diarbekir, Mosul, Baghdad, and Basrah together.' 1 It was questioned whether, on fairly entering the interior of Asia Minor, it should not have rather followed the post road to Sivas, through Bolu and Amasia, than the less frequented road through Angora and Yuzgat. And indeed it will be seen that this line accords with Sir W. O'Shaughnessy's first proposal. But it is probable that, beyond the advantage, if any, of keeping the more ordinary of two lines of traffic, much would not have been gained by such modification of the Turkish plan. The criticisms on the Ottoman administration and executive in putting their plan into execution seem to point more truly to the actual source of evil. Among the higher officials there is no lack of cleverness, and an ability passing- average may here and there be acknowledged : but a supervision wanting honesty, fearlessness, thoroughness and perseverance, loses usefulness and power, however Colonel Biddulph to Sir H.

Of the suboidinates, an experience of the iurkish character conirntncing eighteen years ago leads the present writer to the belief that the Turk of 1858-9, whatever his faults, and whatever the drawbacks over which he had no control, possessed in an eminent degree those qualities of obedience and endurance so valuable in the artihcer and woikman. Before treating the line from Constantinople to Baghdad as a perfected whole and by the light of two detailed inspections under British oflicers after comple tion, it will be well to turn to the official correspondence in 1859-GO ; while it was still in progress, and before any definite arrangements had been made for completing the lower section from Baghdad to Basrah, and thence to the Persian Gulf cable. The view taken by the Home authorities ot the telegraph to India, in respect of the long link through Asiatic Turkey, at the period of Colonel Biddulph's re signation, was naturally not hopeful, nor such as to warrant a hopeful despatch on the subject to the Government of India. Sir William O'Shaughnessy, then Superintendent of Telegraphs in India, not only advised the East India Company as already stated, but had been, two years before, in personal consultation with Lord Stratford on the subject, which was therelore familiar to him. He now put forward a suggestion, transmitted by the Supreme Government to the Secretary of State, that the Turkish Government might be induced to receive the required staff and signallers to carry on and carry out the work, as a loan from the Government of India, whose treasury would meet the expenses, ihe sugges tion was so far supported by the Governor-General of India in Council, that Sir W.

It was in this sense that the ambassador at Constantinople was eventually addressed, and in structed to communicate with the Porte. 1 The presence at Constantinople of her Majesty's Emoy to the Court of Persia was made available on this occasion for a detailed discussion of the question with the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs. 2 Sir Henry Eawlinson's intimate knowledge of the country and people, of politics and prejudices, in Anatolia as in Afghanistan, enabled him readily to elicit from Fuad Pacha all the information required. The Turkish Government was most anxious to complete the telegraph line towards India, and would accept the assistance proffered from that country, carrying the cost to their own debit in account, but on the clear understanding that all parts of the line in Asiatic Turkey would, when completed, be under the management and control of the Ottoman Telegraph administration. The prolongation of the line from Baghdad to Basrah should, in the Turkish minister's opinion, be by subfluvial cable in the ^ Tigris, and as the British Government pro posed to lay a submarine telegraph from Karachi to the Basrah river, so could they provide an additional amount of cable to be continued to Baghdad, the cost of which would be debited to Turkey.

In adverting to its existence, it was ruled that the policy to be pursued with regard to the telegraph through Turkey depended on the value to be attached to an alternative line between England and the East; and that great advantage would be gamed by a double security to the maintenance of telegraphic communication with India. 1 Her Majesty's ambassador at Constantinople ao-ain referred the matter to the Porte. 2 The clause granting a special wire to Indian messages was conceded, and her Majesty's Government asked to specify the point on the Austro-Turkish frontier whence this wire should run to Constantinople. As the capital, it was stated, could be reached by telegraph, from Western Europe, through Belgrade, through Scutari in Albania or Bucharest a choice of routes was offered. This question was, how- ever reserved for after consideration, and the amended Uralt Convention approved, with a few verbal modifica tions tending to show the necessity of progress and ethciency on the lines in Asiatic Turkey. A subfluvial c« l to connect Mosul and Baghdad was talked of by 10 )ttomari Government; but the scheme collapsed replL Sh alt l^r^ ^ ^ ^ FebrUary 21 ' la6a India Office H.

Eventually the Belgrade route was fixed upon as that most convenient for the special wire in European Turkey. That no stipulation to this effect appeared in the pub lished Convention of 1864, still in force and providing for Asiatic traffic only, cannot be attributed to oversight in the original instructions from home. The Foreign Office directs insertion, in proper form, of an article stipulating that a separate wire shall be secured to her Majesty's Government for the transmission of messages to Basrah on their way to India direct from the Turco- Austrian frontier} Experience has shown how essential was the provision to this effect in its integrity. No better proof of the friendly spirit in which the Ottoman Government at this time acted could be cited, than the readiness with which was met the wish of the India Office to test practically the worth of the arrange ments proposed for providing electric communication between Baghdad and Basrah. Fuad Pacha, on learning from her Majesty's Government the sentiments expressed in this respect, admitted at once a new clause m the Convention, providing for British State co-operation in the detailed work. On the 1st September 1860, nothing remained to complete the diplomatic understanding between the two Governments but to determine the period of its duration and confirm it by seal and signa ture. 2 Fifty years was the term proposed at Constanti nople, and this limitation drew forth no objection. 1 Lord Russell to Sir H.

But it was hy no means clear that clue consideration had been given to the comparative merits of the two systems which were available for the object in view. The great cost of making and transport ing, added to the physical difficulties in submerging and preserving, a suitable cable for the Tigris and Sliatt- el-Arab, might perhaps be wisely avoided by the sub stitution of a comparatively inexpensive and easily constructed land line. In favour of the subfluvial cable the chief arguments used had been, 1st, Security from wilful injury committed by the neighbouring Arab tribes; and 2ndly, simplicity in establishing communica tion : but neither of these were convincing if in any degree plausible. The India Office referred the subject for opinion to Major Patrick Stewart, who gave sound reasons for preferring the aerial telegraph. If the question were one of cost, he estimated a cable to be twelve times more costly than a land line. Indepen dently of cost, he considered that not only would the chances of injury, before submersion, be extremely great, but that sooner or later, after submersion, injury must ensue, and the work of repair would, under such circumstances, be unusually difficult. He strongly re commended that at least the first experiment made should be that of a land line. 1 It is but fair to add that other and contrary opinions have been officially recorded on this question. These will be hereafter noted in a discussion on results. Coupling Major Stewart s report with the failure, during the same year of the Red Sea cable, it is not surprising that, in 1860, a pause should 1 Colonel Stewart to Under Secretary of State for India, August H 18G0.ii.] british energy and perseverance. intervene in the course of diplomatic negotiations between England and Turkey, for the establishment of that particular and much abused telegraph which has never held a better or more distinctive designation than ' Indo-Ottoman.' Meanwhile, the brothers MacCallum and Mr. Carthew were not idle, but carried on their labours of telegraph construction with a vigour, skill, and determination which brought credit to themselves and their subordinates confirmed the truth of Colonel Biddulph's high apprecia tion of their capabilities, and reflected honour on the administration they served. On the 10th June 1861, Sir Henry Rawlmson, speaking of these Superintendents' informs the Royal Geographical Society at Burlington House: 'It is mainly owing to the untiring zeal, 0 the temper, and the skill with which they have encountered t imculties and remedied defects as they arose, that the me 18 now 111 a working and efficient state the whole way from Constantinople to Baghdad.' 1 Her Majesty's Government had, however, before at tainment of this desirable consummation, or towards the c ose of the year 1860, deputed Colonel, now Sir Arnold vemball, her Majesty's Consul-General and Political gent at Baghdad, to examine and report upon the whole r e '' r.

No apology will he needed ill reverting to them in this place, or in reviewing seriatim papers of so much interest and impovtance. Arriving at Constantinople on the loth Decernwi 1860 Colonel Kemball at once obtained, in persona communication with the Ottoman Telegraph Depart ment, such information on the condition of the tele- araphic line under construction between Constantinople and Baghdad as would at least prove useful prior to personal inspection. He found that the cable whicli formerly connected Constantinople and Scutari, attei three separate repairs, had been finally abandoned, and that telegrams from Europe to Asia and could only be passed across the Bosphorus by boat. Faultiness in manufacture and damage done by anchors appeared the more likely causes of fa^re m the com munication attempted by submarine cable, ihe luik . engineers had suggested changing the locality to the mouth of the Straits or the Sea of Marmora; but as both the risk of interruption and the cost would be increase by this arrangement, Mr. Greeners proposal to try tie narrowest part of the Bosphorus was considered wortlij of support. A cable of three wires, like one then wor - inty between Hull and New Holland, was suggestet or trial, the cost, inclusive of all charges, not to exceec 1,000?. Mr. Greener agreed with the lurkish engineers in doubting the practicability of success in suspemlnigii.] establishments for asiatic turkey. 81 an aerial steel wire across the Straits, even at an elevation sufficient to admit the constant passage to and fro of ships of every description. The question of establishments for the efficient working of the line was discussed ; the number and duties of the personnel defined, and the necessity of thorough and com petent supervision enjoined. Foreseeing the advantage of enlisting the sympathies in the cause of order of those who could the more immediately injure or protect from injury the whole work, Colonel Kemball urged associa tion in the undertaking of Arab chieftains, relatives or influential adherents of the heads of tribes inhabiting certain tracts designated, as also the employment of Arab horsemen drawn from the same tribes as paid guards or watchmen. The names and classification of stations proposed for Asia Minor and the lower tracts, and a brief notice of the result of a visit to the Scutari Telegraph Office, will, moreover, be found recorded in this preliminary despatch, which concluded with a well- merited compliment to Dawud Effendi, the Director- General of Telegraphs in Turkey. 1 After further inquiries on more palpable shortcomings, and a report to her Majesty's Ambassador, expressing anxiety lest the want of serious organization and earnest effort should prove fatal to efficiency in Asia, and sug gesting administrative reforms by which the Telegraph would become a distinct department of the State, Colonel Kemball set out on his long land journey. He left Scutari on the 9th January and reached Angora on the 26th, marching at the rate of about 18 miles per diem. At first the roads were heavy from rain and snow, but l Agent in Turkish Arabia to Under Secretary of State for India, Constantinople, 22nd December, 1860.82 telegraph and travel. [chap. thev became harder as the party proceeded and frost supervened. The material and construction of the line on this section were reported excellent, but the course taken might, it was considered, be changed with advantage. The personnel was faulty in the absence of skilled inspection and supervision. There were hands but not heads available to carry on the work. 1 he inference from this state of things is plain to those who have lived much in the East. A manipulator can illustrate in practice the objects of a science without necessarily knowing anything of causes; and where superintendents of offices are mere manipulators, not only are they unable to instruct their subordinates in the discovery and remedy of casual defects in line working, but they want that very essential power to enforce respect and discipline which is in no way the exclusive property of science. Many porcelain insula tors were found broken, some were quite useless or had disappeared. In long spans across gullies and ravines, and elsewhere, the wire had been recklessly bound down to the iron bracket, and even to the pok itself. On the 11th February Colonel Kemball arrived at Sivas. The experience of the march from Yuzgat, the midway point between Angora and Sivas, shook that officers confidence in the permanent efficiency of the line unless revision of some portion were effected. ' It seems to have been constructed/' he observes, 'as it there was no such season as winter, or as if, once con structed, it would require no further care or attention. He also saw much to confirm his formerly expressed views of the insufficient supervision exercised. 1 Political Agent in Turkish Arabia to Mr. Baring, dated Angora, January 28, 1861. 2 Ibid, dated Sivas, February 14, 1861.subvey from scutari to diarbekir. The next report, addressed from Diarbekir, the approx imate half-way station between Scutari and Bao-hdad was encouraging in tone. With the exception of white porcelain insulators too fragile for hard service, the materials of which the line was composed were pro nounced excellent. Changes of direction, to facilitate repairs and like objects, were suggested, on the principle that economy of material was out-balanced by the risks and expense of future supervision ; and the absolute necessity of competent inspection was again urged. The formation of store depots was recommended, and, in answer to a prevalent but mistaken wish of the authori ties, attention was drawn to the advantaoes gained in o o retaining the larger and rejecting the smaller size wires for future as well as present purposes. A careful detail of the modifications proposed, and reasons assigned for each, was added : also a separate memorandum on the subject under Mr. Greener's signature. The result of the survey from Scutari to Diarbekir was, however, so far satisfactory as to elicit an emphatic state ment of opinion that under competent supervision, and after certain changes in the course laid down, the utmost confidence might be reposed in the permanent efficiency of the line up to the point reached. 1 Especially gratifying was the recorded conviction, the soundness of which lias been proved by subsequent experience, that the security of the telegraph ran no risk between Scutari and Diarbekir from the inhabitants of the country.

As regards keeping the line in any way secure from wilful damage, the Resident at Bushahr in the Persian Gulf had some years before recorded a most unfavour able opinion. Replying to a reference on the exten sion of telegraphic communication from Karachi west ward by the Persian Gulf, and through Asia Minor to (onstantinople, he had held the scheme impracticable, ' owing to the antagonism of the tribes in all the tract through which the line must pass, and the absence of an effective administration.' 1 He had expressed his con viction that no amount of payment would ensure pro tection for any length of time, and estimated that the cost of a sufficient number of troops to control the nomads would form a more serious item in the accounts than would be the outlay on a submarine line of telegraph. An officer of experience among Turks of Europe and Asia, Colonel San key, writing to Consul Skene of Aleppo on the same subject, had stated his opinion that every convention with the Arabs in the interest of railway or telegraph companies would be uncertain of execution on their part. He doubted not at every bit of wire within their reach would be gripped otf the telegraph to make heel-ropes for their However probable that the latter estimate in M^Ha^lndl 0 ?^ 0 th ® ^ 0,Dmissioner in Sind, July 6,1856.

[chap. iniglit have been intended to carry strict application only to the Arabs of the Euphrates, such restriction cannot be supposed in the other case. Colonel Kemball, grappling with the difficulty on the spot, saw his way to a solution. From Kharput, in Armenia, having heard of the wilful destruction of a ' o portion of the line between Mosul and Baghdad, he had written to her Majesty's Embassy inviting authority to concert measures with certain Pachas for subsidising or otherwise treating with the Arab and Kurdish chiefs O # below Diarbekir ; and this authority had been communi cated to him by telegram. He had made arrangements with the Shammer Bedouins, who overran the tract between the Khabur to the north and the greater Zab to the south of Mosul ; and he now proposed to deal with four other tribes between the Great Zab and Baghdad. Any but casual mention of tribes, Arab or Kurdish, or of places and individuals, must be reserved for a more appropriate chapter : but having already entered upon the question of the respective merits of aerial or sub- fluvial lines of telegraph, we may note in this place that Colonel Kemball, when at Mosul on his downward route of inspection, foresaw great advantages in the aerial over the subfluvial system, and gave in his full adherence to the former, with reference to the pro posed extension of telegraphs in Lower Mcsopotamui and towards the Persian Gulf. The India Office reply to the Mosul despatches throws light on the cause of hesitation in signing the Convention to which allusion has been made, and which her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople was ready to conclude with the Porte in 1860. Colonel Kemball s proceedings were approved by the Secretary of State;ii.] colonel kemball's report from baghdad. 87 but he was informed that the Baghdad-Basrah line should not 1)0 commenced without further communica tion with the home authorities. Some desire had been expiessed on the part ot her -Majesty s Government and the Persian Government to continue the Indo-Ottoman line of telegraph overland, that is, from Baghdad to the I uico-1 ersian frontier and through Persia; and of this the practical result might, it was stated, be the abandonment 1 of a measure which brought in question the respective merits of sea and river cables, and indeed of aerial or subaqueous lines of telegraph. The Great Eastern had not then played her part in Ocean Tele- giaph^ , a part destined to exercise so great an influence on science and the share market. From Kifri, on the 24th April, Colonel Kemball for warded a summary of the arrangements proposed by the local Governor for subsidising the tribes within his jurisdiction. These he discussed in detail; adding a list of injuries already done to the wire, from the character of which he inferred that, as on the outskirts of Asia Minor, there existed no wide-spread antipathy to the telegraph likely to cause permanent danger to its w T ell- being. Kather might the mischief done attest the working of petty malignity on the part of individuals oi the set purpose of a particular class. Colonel Kemball's final report from Baghdad bears date the 7th May, 1861, at which time the heat of the ow country must have contrasted strangely to the travellers with the cold experienced by them in the early part of January, on leaving Scutari and passing over the high lands of Asia Minor. The line had been j ' Racier Secretary of State to Colonel Kemball, dated India Office, June G,88 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. lchap. completed and interruptions repaired ; but the want of a proper staff of signallers caused suspension of commum- cation with Constantinople. These reports and proceedings will at least have made it clear, that the several projects for establishing te egia- phic communication between England and India, wluch circumstances bad concentrated on the Turkish route, had not failed in securing progress of some kind towards the desired end. And although there was no incor porated company to represent private interests, nor any ratified convention to support British diplomatic c or at the Sublime Porte, yet were there in full operation preliminary measures of a sufficiently practical character to satisfy the initiated that time was not wasted or opportunity neglected to the detriment of the cause, either in Europe or Western Asia. Meanwhile, in the far East, interest on the subject had ripened into action. An Indian mutiny had proved the vital importance of an Anglo-Indian telegraph. Persian war had proved the necessity of closer inter course and acquaintance with the Asiatic regions west of India. The proof in both propositions was; un deniable : yet the separate facts were not viewed by all Englishmen alike. In the first case, home sympathies and responsibilities were earnestly engaged to prevent recurrence of calamity; in the second case, demonstra tion was as little heeded in England as prevention. Ihe Rev. Mr. Badger, formerly chaplain at Aden, one ot those remarkable Oriental scholars whose lore was not confined to books, had put forward a proposal for constructing from Karachi to Basrah an aerial line ot telegraph which would obviate the necessity of having recourse to a submarine cable, then considered littleii.j proceedings in turkey and india. reliable and full of risk. And while Colonel Kemball was on the eve of quitting Constantinople to inspect the telegraph lines of Turkish Asia, the Bombay Government was issuing a circular to the Commissioner in Sind and Political Agents at Kelat, Maskat, and Bushahr, callino for report on the practicability, or otherwise of Mr Badger's project.' Three out of the four replies were m its favour ; and had the question been one of mere physical difficulty, it is probable that such difficulty would have been overcome, and the land line carried out m Its entirety. But political obstacles intervened • and there was no scientific process by which these could be removed or their removal accelerated. Upon the whole, the year 1861 was a busy one in respect of the Indian telegraph. Much official corre- spondence which had to be written, was written on the subject, both at home and abroad. We have seen what was done in Turkey. Corresponding activity was apparent on the Indian side. A survey of certain ports of the Makran coast in a Government steamer was uadertaken by one officer in June ; 2 another was com missioned, in December, to move with an escort of horse rom Karachi overland to Gwadar.' It was determined to break ground, as early and as far as practicable, in ■ abhslung a me of British telegraph posts and wires on the seaboard of Baluchistan.

The confidence in lus ability and judgment, inspired by reputation, was increased by nearer and more personal communication. As he became better known to the several authorities presiding over, or eminently connected with, British interests in the East, he was pronounced competent to advise, to guide, to represent his Government. Nor was the process by which this confidence was won, exemplified, and justified, a long one. In two short years from the time of his summons to the work he had accomplished the main object required. The reins once committed to his hands, he disentangled them, and drove his enterprise to success. Diplomatic action at Tehran having followed the home discussions on a telegraph in Persia, and her Majesty's Minister at the Persian Court thinking that negotiation with the Shah's Government would be facilitated by the presence of an officer capable of advising on the tech- mcal details of any proposed draft of convention, the Secretary of State suggested to the Government of India to depute Major Patrick Stewart, late Officiating upenntendent of Indian Telegraphs, to the head° quarters of her Majesty's Legation in Persia, there o render such assistance as might be required. The suggestion was readily complied with, and Stewart accompanied by a brother Officer of Engineers, proceeded o Bushahr, the port in the Persian Gulf whence travel er rom India usually commence the land journey to the Persian capital. 1 .1 ^L 0111 ' &gt;u ^ ia h r &gt; Colonel Stewart reported progress to the Government of India.

Colonel (now Sir) Henry Green, and Air Hubert \V alton of the Indian Telegraph Department, in a trip of survey along the Arabian side of the Persian bull. It had been asked whether a series of short deep sea ra lies laid between certain islands to be selected for telegraph stations might not afford the simplest means 0 connecting Makran with Turkish Arabia. The above named officers, sent to investigate the merits of this scheme, had declared in its favour; but, although present ing a fair aspect in its freedom from political complica tions, it did not commend itself to Colonel Stewart in supersession of the original proposal. While determin ing, however, that, apart from all political considerations telegraphic communication might safely be secured by land line constructed from Karachi to Cape Jask or or some ,00 miles across the sea frontier of Sind and S:f th , 0 e0ast . 0f M ^n, he had not made up 1^ Bushibr t0 thC G0 ™^ of India from usnal.r, on two material particulars.

Precarious indeed would be telegraphic communication with the East if dependent on one line only vhetliei aerial, subaqueous, or subterranean. Hie ( lancxb o serious interruption of one line must always be great, while those of similar interruption simultaneously on two or more lines should be remote.

It was recommended that a land line should be com pleted from Karachi westward, at least as far as Gwadar, and that a series of submarine cables should be laid from the head of the Persian Gulf to meet this line on the Makran coast. The more recent experience in sub marine telegraphy obtained in England had been confir- Ml n FORT AND FLAG-STAFF, FAO, TURKISH AlIAIilA. matory of the justness of this matured opinion. And Colonel Stewart further recommended that permission &gt;e asked from the Ottoman Porte for British officers to treat with and, if necessary, subsidise the Arab tribes x twecn Baghdad and Basrah ; or, failing such permis- ® lon ' to endeavour to secure the co-operation of the ui ish authorities in constructing and maintaining t'' aeual line of telegraph, for which stores should at n once rii!

Finally, he recommended that negotiations be re -opened with the ('ourt of ersia for a land line from Baghdad to Tehran, Ispahan, Shiraz and Bushahr. This would prove a valuable alter native, in case of interruption, to the Turkish line to t ic sea and the sea prolongation to Bushahr. In a second despatch, dated about a month later reasons were given for preferring Fao, at the tnout i o the Shatt-el-Arab, to Koweit, further down the Ara nan maritime coast, as the terminal point westward ot the submarine cable. A suggestion was at the same time put in to lay a small section of sea cable between Gwadar and Karachi, as an alternative to the land line, for greater security of communication. This scheme, then, sketched and matured m J 8G2 became the accepted basis of future operations; anc orders were issued without delay to carry out the several details. We will now return to Turkey, and trace to within a few weeks of completion the line of telegraph in the Ottoman dominions in Asia, of which the link from Baghdad to the sea had become the main object of attention to her Majesty's Government and the India Office. . The Porte declined to entrust to the British Govern ment the construction of the telegraph from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf, but agreed to undertake the work on receiving the assurance that the Indian cable would be ready ot the point of junction. It was informed in reply, that fulfilment of the condition might be confi dently expected at the end of the ensuing }eai, 1603, but the acceptance of British co-operation was still 1 Lieut.-Colonel P.

Indeed, the Political Agent in lurkish Arabia had already been in coinniunication with the Grovernor-G-eneral of the Province on the precise route to be followed by the con- templated line, \\hen Colonel Stewart's programme for- warded b\ the (xovcinment of Bombay reached him in January 1863.- Namik Pacha had fully agreed to a proposal of preliminary inspection made to him by Colonel Kemball, who, by acting in concert with the Turkish local officers on such occasions, was honoured with a confidence not commonly tendered by His Ex cellency to Europeans. On the 7th February, Lieutenant Stiffe and Mr. Gieener arrived at the Baghdad Residency from Basrah, whither they had been brought by the Indian steamer. The former had been deputed by Colonel Stewart in England, under sanction of the India Office, to make investigations and take soundings in the Persian Gulf preparatory to laying a submarine cable ; the latter, who had accompanied Colonel Kemball on his overland journey from Constantinople in the winter of 1860 -61, had been again sent out to render aid in the construc tion of the line below Baghdad. Colonel Kemball and staff proceeded on their new journey of inspection on the 12th March.

Had the officers of the Indian Navy bequeathed no other record of their existence than those admirable surveys, which not only embrace the Indian Seas, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf, but the rivers of Central Asia, they would have earned an imperishable title to consideration; and Colonel Stewart's Marine Assistant, if he may be so called, was a worthy representative of this distinguished class. Returning to Baghdad after a month s tour, the Political Agent reported as follows:—'In submitting an itinerary, with a sketch map of the route selected for the proposed line of telegraph to Basrah, I have the honour to state that, by common consent of the Engineers of my party, no obstacles of moment exist to the pro secution of the work ; nor need recourse be had any where to a subfluvial cable or the subterranean wires originally proposed by the Turkish employes.' 1 He divided the route into five sections, averaging somewhat more than 60 miles each ; leaving to the dis cretion of the Turkish executive a diversion which would increase the distance by about 12 miles. The tract to be traversed, exclusive of the diversion, was thus esti mated at 313 miles; the whole, with the exception of 38 miles into Basrah, being on the left bank of the Euphrates, or, in literal parlance, in Mesopotamia. Lower than Basrah this particular survey did not extend. The first section, from Baghdad to Hilleh, was a great thoroughfare for pilgrims, and occasionally subject to tribe incursion, otherwise devoid of population as of ?

In the following two sections, or from Hilleh to Khidhr, lay the doubtful portion of the route. It was questionahJe whether a better line might not be obtained by crossing and recrossing the river, and following 123. 1 - nnles on the right bank in lieu of 112 on the left bank of tiie Euphrates between Hilleh and Khidhr; but the preference shown by the local Government to deal with the tribes on the left bank eventually decided the point in its favour. These sections would include the midway station of Dewaniyeh, up to which from Hilleh the route was described as ' favourable throughout for e egraplnc operations.' From Dewaniyeh to Khidhr t lough no difficulties were apparent or apprehended, a further partial survey by Mr. Vice-Consul Johnston and Lieutenant Bewsher, I.N., would be awaited. These gentlemen, who were about returning from Baghdad to asrah, would take the opportunity of investigating the question further on their downward journey. The fourth section, from Khidhr to Hnmar, was remarkable as eeping the left bank when the right would appear pi imo ficie and physically, the more convenient. Here also, however, the Pacha was desirous of avoiding the nght bank Arabs. Colonel Kemball, while finding 1,0 material objection to adopt the desired course, did not however, lose sight of the fact that Arabs cross and re,' &lt;ioss a river when it suits their purpose. The fifth or ast section involved a crossing to the right bank at JVoina where the Euphrates joins the Tigris, and forms «ifli that river the broad stream, which, under the name of the Shatt-el-Arab, conveys their united waters 0 the sea. From this point, which occurs at two-fifths 0 the distance to be traversed from Humar, the line folW the 'ght bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, skirtino- 2 • O100 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

Extra time and care were required to surmount these, but there was clearly nothing m the way of success which could severely tax the practised tele graph engineer. Mr. Greener, in a letter to (olonel Stewart accompanying Colonel Kcmball's above-quoted despatch, designates the work contemplated ' a straig i - forward piece of business,' and expresses an opinion that, with a little energy on the part of the native employs and assistants, the line might be ready, or nearly so, y the time that the proposed Indian cable reached the sea mouth of the Basrah river. A very few days after the date of his own despatch Colonel kemball was enabled to add the report of the two officers commissioned to inspect minutely the smal^ tract of undefined land between Dewamyeh and Klndhr.

Mr. Johnston observed many villages and much cultivation in the counti \ traversed, and at one time rode along a belt of high land ' varying in breadth from 200 yards to tA\ o miles, between two lines ol wheat and barlev cultivation, bordering in both instances marsh and rice lands. At another time the ground was so thickly covered with high thorn-trees as to become obstructive to horses. The Euphrates was then said to be within ll * ue highest level reached for some years preceding. The Arabs met with on the way furnished example, as usual, ot that internecine tribe hostility to which perhaps the European traveller, however ho may deplore its existence, may often owe his life. Plunder may be a normal occupation ; but retaliation is rather the ruling passion; and in this condition, the non partisan is an object of comparative indifference. Shortly after these proceedings the Government of Bombay was othcially advised that, under agreement with the Turkish Government, materials for the telegraph line below Baghdad, including iron posts for the whole distance, had been provided in England, the cost bcino- advanced by the Government of India. Moreover, that three sailing vessels laden with the same had started for the port of Basrah ; that a specially qualified in spector was about to proceed, via Beyrout, to Baghdad, ^ here he would assist Mr. Greener in distributing the stores; and that two non-commissioned officers of the Royal Engineers had been selected to promote the work of construction in association with the Turkish working- parties. 1 'Secretary of State to Government of Bombay ; No. !), August 15, 1863.10 2 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. Bearing precisely the same date and address, but a prior number, another despatch notified the appoint ment by the Secretary of State of Lieutenant Murdoch Smith of the Royal Engineers and officers of the Indian Telegraph Department, as Superintendents of sections of the Turco-Persian Telegraph, the construction of which, from Baghdad to Khanikin, and Khanikin to Tehran, had been negotiated with the Governments of Turkey and Persia respectively. It further stated, that two Telegraph Inspectors had been engaged for the same service, and that, in addition to all these, two Engineer Officers and two Inspectors would be required from India. By this despatch the local Govcmment addressed was vested with the responsibility of the operations in the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia, and on the coast of Makran, as though these were conducted within the limits of the Bombay Presidency. 1 The arrangement was in accordance with a suggestion of the Government of India, after experience of its nominal control in the Foreign Department over the telegraph operations already carried out in Makran. There is little occasion to revert to or record the delays, or causes of delay, in concluding the written terms which are found in the protocol signed at Con stantinople on the 20th October, 1863, by Mr. Erskine and Ali Pasha. The following appear to be the more noteworthy points of this record, and those which were unaffected by after correspondence on the subject;— I. The Ottoman Government to extend at their own cost their aerial telegraph lines from Baghdad, in one direction to the Persian frontier at Khanikin, in the 1 Secretary of State to Government of Bombay ; No. 8, August 15,II.] protocol of october 20, 1863. - 103 other to Basrah. The Indian Government to lay at its own cost a submarine cable, prolonged from Bushahr westward to Basrah, or some other more convenient point of junction with the Turkish land line. II. The Indian Government to supply all materials, including iron poles, for both the aerial lines from Baghdad, repayment being made from the proceeds of telegraph messages, under a special arrangement re served for after decision. Salaries of British engineers employed in construction to be paid by Indian Govern ment. III. Operations to be commenced by both contracting Governments as quickly as possible : but the Baghdad- Khanikin line to await completion of the other. 1 The note of preparation had now been fairly sounded; and a stir had been effected in England and in India, in Turkey and in Persia, which promised to realize the best results. On the 26th November, 18G3, Colonel Kemball forwarded to the India Office a copy of his despatch to her Majesty's Embassy at Constantinople reporting commencement of operations for the com pletion of the Ottoman line of telegraph to the head of the Persian Gulf. 2 But the Political Agent, in undertaking to look after the work, so far as British interests were concerned, had heaped upon himself a not inconsiderable amount of labour. Fortunately for the success of the cause, he was able and willing to take in hand all difficulties of minor detail, as those of sheer political character; and while infusing a spirit of earnestness into the local executive, and luring a loth 1 Mr. Hammond to Mr. Merivale, October 24, 18U3, and Sir H.

Administration to conciliate instead ol irritate the proud and turbulent Arabs, he did not neglect the smaller but very essential facts that bills of lading s ion c correspond in number and description with articles received, and that a brand or incision on a case was a surer distinguishing mark than a piece of hn liable to removal by the accidents of transport. Ihese and other practical remarks were forced from him by an experience which, to say the least, is tiying. Especiall} to the point was the opinion in favour of the malleable iron Insulator with cap detached, or a malleable iron arm with removeable wrought-iron cap, against that with cast-iron arm and cap run in one mould. In the latter case, after packing, fracture is common, and completely disables: in the former, the packing is facilitated by reduction of weight, and fracture rendered improbable. The despatch treating of these matters reported arrival of the Athene and Khimji Oodooji, two of three store-ships expected. Lieutenant Murdoch Smith with a detachment of Royal Engineers also reached Basrah on the 15th November. Certain special circumstances attending the construc tion of the line below Baghdad and equally affecting the further prolongation of the Indo-Ottoman lelegraph to its sea terminus at Fao, together with the chiono- logical relation of this particular section to the whole work performed, render it expedient to take ItaAe of working parties in these parts, and reintroduce them at a later period. They will be revisited on the scene of their labours when the story of the Gu cable and the Persian negotiations shall have made their position more intelligible. Enough has been written at least to convince the reader that the w interli .j HOSPITALITIES AT BAGHDAD. 105 of 1863-64 was a busy season for the few Englishmen engaged in constructing a land telegraph in Lower Mesopotamia. It will also have become patent that the difficulties encountered were rather of a political than a physical character. Meanwhile, Patrick Stewart was on his way from Karachi with the cable. Bringing m his charge to a tempoiai^ land station at lao, the embouchure of the Shatt-el-Aiab, diul selecting a site for a permanent Office, he moved up the river to Baghdad, arriving on the mh April. The proverbial hospitalities of the Political Agency, or Residency as sometimes called, were illustrated on this occasion in the usual man ner, notwithstanding that the mission which pre sented itself there was formidable in point of numbers. After a few days' sojourn in the City of the Caliphs, Colonel Stewart, Sir Charles Bright, and others of the party, returned to Bombay. One remained the full month: and he was detained for authority from Constantinople to inspect the line to the capital in an upward journey from Baghdad to the Bos- phorus, going over again the ground which had been traversed three years before by Colonel Kemball. It was on the 19th May that Colonel Goldsmid pro ceeded on this particular duty, accompanied by the late Mr. Assistant-Superintendent Kersting of the Telegraph Department. 1 0 I ho Report of the last-noted inspection is dated from era, wheie the writer joined Colonel Stewart in August 1864, about six weeks after that officer had himself arrived rom India. It comprised, besides a rough diary and » er incidental enclosures, a review of the then existing coudition of the line of telegraph, and a memorandum . i ii m i h106 telegraph and travel. [chap. of changes which appeared requisite for its general improvement. A few of the more salient points may be cursorily stated. Transfer of the Telegraph Station at Mosul to the left bank of the Tigris was particularly urged, owing to the constant exposure of the line to interruption by crossing and recrossing the river with the mere view of reaching, in the heart of the town, an Office which would be quite as well placed outside and on the opposite bank. Many of the posts were weak, and insufficient to the work. For 750 miles above Baghdad poplars were generally procurable without material cost or difficulty ; for 480 miles further, up to Gaiveh, fir poles were the rule ; and for the next two stages to Izmid the wood was oak. To meet the re- quirements of 1276 miles of telegraph from Baghdad to Izmid, there were found 18 Bash Chaoshes, or in spectors, and 107 Chaoshes, or sub-inspectors. Of these it was roughly estimated that three-fourths were active, intelligent men, and well fitted to their work. The heads of stations were not generally unintelligent, but stood much in need of theoretical instruction. Of the porcelain insulators used, it was rare to find half a dozen whole. The straining insulator was too seldom seen. Little appeared to have been done since Colonel Kemball's visit to remedy the minor though important defects which the Political Agent had brought to notice. Yet the opinion was expressed withal that the condition of the line, though not quite satis factory in detail, promised good results, if only a sufficient number of qualified inspectors were appointed, attention given to remedy the defective insulation, and the changes specified admitted to have effect.

Taking the usual Red Sea route to Egypt, he proceeded from Alexandria to Constantinople. Here he had been for some time engaged in the many preliminaries inseparable from an anxiously expected announcement that telegraphic com munication was actually open between London and Karachi, when joined by the Overland travellers. The question of improving the existing Asiatic lines was at once discussed by Colonels Stewart and Goldsmid, Mr. MacCallum the inspector in Ottoman pay, and Mr. Courtenay the British telegraph commissioner, or official agent of her Majesty's Government appointed to look after the interests of the telegraph at Constanti nople. The change of certain stations, notably Mardin and Mosul, better insulation of the second or Indian wire, greater care in passing the wire through large towns such as ^ uzgat, Sivas, and Diarbekir, and a more judicious division of inspectors' ranges—these and other details were pressed, and more or less investigated. Diplomatic interviews followed .* official and ceremonial visits were paid ; but the homme d'affaires has not the same type in all cities, albeit these be restricted to Europe; and while ' business is business ' may be a proverb universally acknowledged, the practical definition of what is business will be perhaps very generally dis- C ^ l0ne !

(Lionel Stewart's presence, however, was not unpro- iluclive of good, and even early fruits; and the aetive assistance of her Majesty's Embassy enabled him to see comploted and sent home in September 1864, a Conven tion with the Porte, in amplification of the protocol of the previous year. With a short statement of the pur- port of this mutual understanding and the means jy which it was attained, we will conclude a chapter not intended quite to reach the exact period when one unbroken line of telegraph first united England to India. Mr. Erskine had in the commencement ot ISM drafted the project of a ' preliminary Convention with iho IVirte in accordance with certain instruction^ ie- .vivod from the Foreign Office on the subject of the telegraph to India ; but Ali Pacha, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, had. preferred transfemng some of its stipulations to » separate note or omitting tliem alrocether.

KM) these l)e accepted, it was answered, the Secretary of State for fndia had no objection to ratification ensuing. There was not much real difficulty in disposing of the points at issue. The very sufficient limit of 50 was assigned to the English personnel at Fao: permanent Ottoman stations were expressly stipulated for Baghdad and Lao, though not for Basrah and Khanikin : and the exchange and rates were modified agreeably to the India Office suggestion. The ratified (invention may be summarised as follows:— Article I. Prolongation, at the cost of Turkey, of its Scutari-Baghdad telegraphic line, from Baghdad to the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab on one side, and the Persian frontier at Khanikin on the other.

The vacillation and instability manifested b;y the authorities in Persia were unfavourable signs of accomplishing there also an undertaking whose success was dependent on determined as well as com bined action. The lapse of years had, moreover, brought apprehension of the fact that the main causes of failure in the Red Sea cable were by no means incapable of dis connection from future attempts of a like nature. He had come to the conclusion that he would, at all events, submit a recommendation in accordance with the spirit of the times. Many months had not passed since the Submarine Telegraph Committee had promulgated the authoritative opinion that the failures of existing sub marine lines might have been guarded against, had adequate preliminary investigation been made ; together with the conviction that, if due regard were had to certain principles theretofore enunciated, the class of enterprise to which these cables belonged might prove as successful as it had been disastrous. 1 Colonel Stewart's first detailed proposal, in pursuance of the above views, reports the measures requisite for 110 early construction of a submarine cable, to be laid in the Persian Gulf, and for the establishment of electric communication with the East by that route. It was accompanied by an approximate estimate of the time and cost of manufacture, transport, and submersion. The ength of cable to be provided was 1,050 nautical miles, computed on the assumed distance between Fao and the an ine terminus at or near Gwadar in Makran. of sSnrin! a P pointcd to inr l' ire the Construction Telegraph ( ables, presented to Parliament, April, 1B61. iii Hi . ; ,1- ^ 1 - ir i . i m , i sitelegraph and travel. 1 CHAP. As regards the core or electrical conductor to be vised, the opinion of eminently qualified engineers had been invited, and was awaited, on the more important detads, such as weiaht, dimensions, material, mode of construction and standard of electrical efficiency. In the meanwhile, progress had been made in collecting information on the subject, procuring specimens of core ot various mcs, and reading practical lessons for guidance in the reports supplied to the Treasury on the condition of the Malta and Alexandria cable. Great stress was laid on the necessity of applying frequent and careful tests pending manufacture. , i ^ i ^ Colonel Stewart reckoned that it would take hve months to make the core, and another five months to cover it Ho allowed delays for testing and other pur poses, and named a probable date on which to commence the process of stowing on board ship. Estimating ic steam freight required on the weight of ordinary cables, he suggested that early steps be taken to provide tor shipping exigencies, and especially for coal and coalms stations. He drew attention to the seasons which ex perience of the Persian Gulf had indicated as favourable to work ; and showed that while vessels might sad with out steam from about the latitude of the Mauritius to Maskat during August and September, such frcet om action could not be depended on at a later date Iherc were reasons to expect that the land line from Karacm to Gwadar would be completed in March 18C3, an^ the Mesopotamian line in December.

But while himself giving a ^ ei y sufficient basis for full inquiry and report, Colonel Stewart pointed out the necessity of commissioning an officer to obtain all the preliminary information requisite to ensure a wise decision. Not many days later a further report submitted the measures considered to afford the best security for efficient execution of the important and arduous duties, on the due performance of which depended the success of the whole programme. In advocacy of the principle of continued and undivided responsibility in every part of the enterprise, so that those employed be brought to hold their professional reputations directly concerned in the permanence, as in the first success of the work un dertaken ; a proposal made by Messrs. Bright and Clark, the eminent Engineers, to assist in the general control of cable operations, was recommended for approval. The tender of personal service being combined with that of providing all the requisite staff from first to last, and other contingencies, such an arrangement would enable tolonel Stewart to apply himself to the general super- mtendence of an undertaking of which a submarine cable as \ery justly explained to be by no means the only portion demanding his attention. 2 Cmte nT88 2 PatriCk SteWart 10 th0 Un ' lCT SeCreta, 7 'f !

Shore ends were to be laid at Fao, Bushahr, and the two stations nearer India; and the vessel carrying these was to precede the others by at least a month. As regards the engagements to be undertaken by Messrs. Bright and Clark, it was ex plained that the Staff supplied by these gentlemen would be for the supervision and control of the opern- tions of laying, not the actual execution of the work. And in literal fulfilment of this agreement it was pro vided that the duties of mechanics employed m un coiling, cleansing, watching breaks, jointing and so forth, would involve an extra charge, though small, upon the State. 1 Consultation was held with Captains Constable anc Jones of the Indian Navy on the best route for the cable, and other matters connected with its maintenance and security in the Persian Gulf, a locality which former experience had rendered familiar to both. It has already been stated that an officer was deputed to take the soundings. Lieutenant Stiffe's presence in England prior to despatch on that duty was a fortunate ciienni stance for Colonel Stewart, at a time when interchange of ideas and oral expression of views had a value un known to official foolscap. 1 he charts prepaied b) Captain Constable and Lieutenant Stiffe gave especial prominence to the head-land of Masandam, wheie it ^as proposed to find a spot suited to the recjuuementt of a working telegraph, and the position of which waf naturally suggestive of a store depot and convenient i Lieut.-Colonel Patrick Stewart to Under Secretary of State for India, October 8, 18(52.TRANSPORT AND ir port of call for vessels navigating the neighljourino- waters. 1 Ihe reports, on tiie reference officially made to tliem, of Professor Thomson, Messrs. Siemens and Halske' Messrs. Ford and Jenkin, Mr. Varlcy, Mr. Walker and Dr. Esselhach, enabled Colonel Stewart to recommend to the India Office the description of core required for the proposed cable. And in forwarding such recommenda tion he asked permission to take immediate steps for the manufacture of 880 nautical miles of the said core at a cost not exceeding 851. per mile ; as well as to obtain' by public competition, tenders for manufacture of the completed cable the preparations of which had been provided for by detailed specification. 5 Furthermore, specimens of the proposed cable havino- been lodged m the offices of the Engineers, and adver tisements inviting tenders published in the daily papers a correspondence was opened with certain well-known firms coming forward to negotiate the manufacture (,ffer made h Messrs.

[chap. argued with n show of advantage on eithci sidf, and eventually decided in favour of the latter, lor the tians- port of far the greater part of the cable: but it was held advisable to reduce the heavy expenditure con templated to a minimum. To this end the employment of vessels belonging to the Admiralty seemed to offer the most natural suggestion. But the experience of the Atlantic Cable Expedition, in which H.M. ship Aga memnon had been exposed to unusual and excessive straining, was against the renewal of like arrangements. The objection, however, applied strictly to commissioned ships of war, and had hardly the same force in respect of other Government craft. Colonel Stewart's proposal was therefore to utilise 'vessels which, though moderately new and still in excellent preservation, have become ' out of date ' from the recent rapid changes in the science of naval construction, and which are unlikely to be either ' convertedplated, or commissioned as sailing vessels of war.' He stated his belief that such were to be found lying as hulks at Chatham, Sheerness, Portsmouth and Devonport; that they represented in their then condition but little money value, and were deteriorating at their moorings. The strength of their frames rendered them well qualified for the purposes under consideration; and names were given in illustra tion of the reasoning. He anticipated the consent of the authorities of the Admiralty to place four such vessels at the disposal of the Government of India for a limited period, on condition that it bore wholly the cost of repairing, equipping, and sailing. r lhe proposal was, moreover, considered advantageous to both the great Departments concerned.

Nor did the year 1862 close without an expression ot public satisfaction at the measures taken in so wise and resolute a spirit. A prominent article in the Tnucs described the whole scheme with sufficient exactitude to cause regret that it was not resuscitated in reply to much misapprehension subsequently expressed in the columns of the same paper. It represented the Indian line as asking for no subscriptions and making no appeal to the public : as undertaken by the Indian Government, of them selves, under circumstances which amply justified the s ti'p. It set forth that the entire superintendence and control had been entrusted to a distinguished and experienced officer, who had chosen Sir Charles Bright and Mr. Latimer Clark, electrical engineers, for the undertaking, and for submerging the line. It traced the course of the main land line through Asiatic Turkey, and the alternative section branching off therefrom at Baghdad and rejoining at Bushahr. No word was said a Russian junction with this line, a contingency not then contemplated. It described the course of the cable, Lieut.

The following extract from the article under reference, appropriate to this place, is valuable, not only in point of accurate detail, but as expressive of the strong public sympathy then acknowledged for the Government enterprise. It should be premised that, in addition to the three sectious of cable to be laid between Fao and Gwadar, a fourth section had been sanctioned as an alternative to the land line, and fur greater security to the communication between Karachi and Gwadar. 2 'The design and construction of the cable differ very materially from any line hitherto laid. Every operation in submariue telegraphy—even the great Atlantic line, has contributed its quota of valuable experience ; for, though successfully laid by Sir Charles Bright' and his assistant engineers, in spite of its imperfect construction, it was destroyed by the injudicious electrical treatment it received after submersion. This fact is now so well established that the cause of the failure of the Atlantic cable may be considered as set at rest for ever. The insulation of that line was not very perfect, as may be imagined Irom the infancy of the science at that time, but yet the electrical power used was such as would infallibly break down even the most perfect cables manufactured at the present day. ' Thr Time*, Deccmbor 26, 1862. India Offire to Colonel Stewart, June 24, 1863.III.] ARTICLE IN THE 'TIMES.' 121 Of this our readers may judge when it is stated that the large induction coils first used in signalling between England and America were probably equal in electrical power to 2,000 battery cells, while now it is found inexpedient to use more than two or three cells in working the longest submarine lines in existence. Some of this great power was no doubt used in the vain hope of forcing signals through the line at a greater speed than the very slow and unremunerative rate at which it lias alone been found possible to communicate through an unbroken length of 3,000 miles. The result was disastrous, but the experience, though dearly bought, has proved of great valuu. It has taught electricians the value of moderating the power used in working lines, and above all has pointed out the impera tive necessity of having no single section of a submarine line of more than 600 miles in length. To lay long submarine cables in a continuous length without intermediate stations has been found to answer no other purpose than that of greatly diminish ing the speed of working and multiplying every imaginable risk both of manufacture and submersion. The Indian Government, acting under the judicious counsel of their scientific advisers, have wisely determined to divide the Persian Gulf cable into three sections, though its total length will not exceed 1,500 statute miles. Ihe faults which led to the destruction of the Red Sea line were of another character. Though it was manufactured and tested with a care greatly superior to that taken with the Atlantic cable, it was submerged in a way which rendered its ceasing to work a question of a few weeks more or less. Sheathed in a covering of small wires, quite unprotected from corrosion, it was laid without any allowance for ' slack ' cable t( J hill into the irregularity of the bottom of the sea. It consequently lay strained across the points of the inequalities, wtli a tension of several thousand pounds. As the unpro tected wires rusted away, and the suspended portions of the •ne became loaded with coral and barnacles, the whole line 'nml.led into hundreds of pieces by its own weight. This ls no mere hypothetical opinion, but a fact, which was amply 1M ;| iHJ' it i iii -1ii : lift*; i 1 fi fill! 1 if tf I l ' k : • ..122 telegraph and travel. [chap. proved by the expedition to the Eed Sea in 18G1 under Mr. Latimer Clark. There can be little doubt that the same cause led to the temporary failure ot the Malta and Alexandiia line, as well as that laid for the French Government between Toulon and Algiers. 'To obviate this cause of danger, which in the above-mentioned lines has probably occasioned a loss oi property to the value of over a million sterling, the Persian Gult line is cased in I-, No. 7 gauge hard-drawn iron wires, thickly galvanized, so as effectually to prevent their corrosion. But, in order to secure more effectually the permanent stability of the line, the whole finished cable is thickly coated with two servings of tarred hemp yarn, overlaid with two coatings of a patent composition invented by Sir Charles Bright and Mr. Latimer Clark. The composition consists of mineral pitch or asphalt, Stockholm tar, and powdered silica, mixed in certain proportions, and laid on in a melted state. While yet warm it is passed between circular rollers, which give it a round, smooth surface. When quite cold this forms a massive covering of great strength and perfect flexibility, totally impervious to water, and incapable of being destroyed by the minute animalculse which exist in such abundance in warm latitudes, and which, when the cable is not protected against their attacks, eat every atom of the hemp, as in the case of the cable laid between Toulon and Algiers. Galvanizing the wire is in itself an almost perfect protection from rust—certainly for many years, as the good condition of the cable picked up off the Kooria Mooria Islands, a part ol which was galvanized, showed, as far as the galvanizing was concerned. But, with the final protection both from rust and animalculae which Bright and Clark's compound affords, there appears to be no reason why this cable, when once laid in shallow or deep waters, should not remain good for a hundred years to come. The copper conducting wire is composed of four segments, drawn into a hollow tube in such a manner as to appear like a solid wire. By this means all the advantages of a strand wire are combined with the condensed bulk and sma surface of a solid one. The copper from which the wiie ^ARTICLE IN THE 'TIMES:' 123 high drawn is especially selected by the engineers for its capacity for conducting electricity. It is, perhaps, not generally known that different samples of copper vary as much as 50 or 60 per cent, in this respect,—that is, some specimens of copper wire will conduct electricity with greater facility than other specimens of double the thickness, though physically there may not be the slightest difference by which you can distinguish one from the other. This wire, which is nearly one-eighth of an inch m diameter, is then covered by the Gutta-Percha Com pany with four distinct coats of gutta-percha, and four coats of Chattertons compound laid on alternately. This 'core,' as it is termed, is then tested in cold water, at a temperature of 90 degrees, and then under a pressure of 6001b. to the square inch. After passing through all these ordeals, the loss by leakage through the gutta-percha covering does not exceed one hundred-millionth part of the current of electricity passing through the conducting wire in every nautical mile. To such minute perfection has the system of testing adopted bv the engineers been carried, that the loss of one thousand- nnllionth part of the current by leakage could be detected and estimated on the instruments. In the present state of the insulation of the cable, the loss by leakage in working each section of the line will not exceed one four-hundredth part of the electric current sent through the conductor-a condition of insulation which we believe has never been equalled by any cable hitherto manufactured. 'Before being sheathed at Mr. Henley's works the coils of gutta-percha core, which are in three-mile lengths, are again ested under water for insulation and for resistance of conductor therefore if any injury should have occurred to the fragile gutta- perc la covering of the wire during its transit from the Wharf- road to North Woolwich it is detected before the cable is made up, and then the process of sheathing them in their outer covering is commenced. The first coating outside the gutta percha is 12 thick strands of wet hemp, and over these again come 12 solid No. 7 gauge wires, which have been most care- p. • UX11CU llctV 1 } galvanized by Mr. Henley.

[chap. wire is generally the la3t which a cable receives, 'but in this instance, as the line is to be laid in comparatively shallow water, the wires themselves, though galvanized, are to be still farther protected from their most formidable enemy, rust, which is done by the coverings of Bright and Clark's composition already described. _ , « ' During the whole time the cable is at Mr. Henley s the current is kept always through it, so that the slightest possible defect in the wire can be detected. In addition to this, the very able electrical staff test every portion regularly twice a day for insulation and resistance of conductor. When every thing has been done which the most jealous care and the most fastidious scientific skill can suggest, it is passed out on the river side of Mr. Henley's factory and coiled away in tanks filled with water; and even here perpetually watched and tested. There are upwards of 900 nautical miles ol it thus manufactured lying at Mr. Henley's works—huge coils of thick black-looking rope, nearly H in- in diameter, weighing nearly four tons to the mile, and 2^ tons in water, and costing as nearly as possible 200/. per mile—the cheapest, strongest, and, electrically speaking, the most perfect cable that has ever yet been made.' 1 And a still later article supplies interesting and appropriate extracts :— 'The last ships of the squadron appointed to convey this cable, which in a few months will connect England with the remotest provinces of our Indian empire, have either sailed this week or will leave now in a few days more. Unforeseen causes, stress of weather, difficulty in obtaining all the varied appliances and apparatus necessary for so remote and important an expedition, have delayed the starting of some of the ships beyond the time at first contemplated.

Each ship as we have said, has been most perfectly fitted out, and each, as far as equipment goes, forms a perfect expedition in itself—a complete link in the chain of stations which is to n ■ j i 41 of the Gulf. The Assam and connect Bombay with the 1 u , . , ,1 a re atest the Tweed, the vessels which have just started «' 4l '« « • lengths of cable, may be taken as fair samples of the who e squadron. These vessels are sister ships built ot Malabar teak and intended as frigates for the old India Company, l.o h arc ot great speed, and both are of such prodigious strength that there are probably no wooden vessels in Her Majesty s navy so strongly bound together. In each of these, as m , the 'other ships' of the expedition, three massive wrought-.ron tanks have been built from the bottom up to the main .lock one forward, one amidships, and one aft. In these the cable is carefully stowed away in three coils, the beginning and the end of each coil being carried along the ships to the testing room, .and the tanks arc then filled with water by a small steam pump on deck. A member of Sir Charles Brighfs electrical staff goes with each ship, and has sole charge of the cable, which he can thus test through while under water in the tanks daily, and m case ot any leakage being discovered have time to ^ localize the fault in the insulation, if any should occur, lo before the time for submerging arrives. Being thus able to watch the condition of the wire from day to day is ot i utmost possible importance, though from various causes it ias not been practicable till now to adopt the precaution. i each section of the cable are also sent all the appliances necessary for paying out and buoying, with a staff of skilled workmen lor making joints and cutting out faulty places, if any ^b s ho'U be discovered in the voyage out, iron posts foi lam . grappling-irons for raising the wire, and mo^t pel ic a costly sets of instruments, some ot the most delicate . which will be kept either at the stations or at the head -qnai o-' at Karachi, in case of any unforeseen difficulties in working.III.] extract* from press. 127 As far, however, as the most anxious care and forethought can guard against accidents none are likely to arise. In fact, the same delicate system of testing adopted during the manufacture, which could detect and record the loss of one thousand- millionth part of the current by leakage, shows that, if possible, the cable now in the tanks on board the Assaye is in even better electrical condition than when it left Mr. Henley's works. The Assaye was driven into Plymouth by desperately heavy weather, yet so strong was the ship, and so well was the cable stowed, that the last tests taken before the vessel sailed on Saturday showed each section to be in a higher condition of insulation than any submarine cable ever exhibited before. On board each of the ships go a certain portion of the staff which is hereafter to work the line from station to station along the Gulf. At each station will be a superintendent and deputy-super- intendent, with six clerks—the latter the best instrument hands that could be procured ; the former all gentlemen of from ten to twelve years' experience at the large stations in England. At some of the stations the staff will have but a dull time : at Khasab, the lonely point of rock off the Arabian coast, for instance, where the hostility of the Arabs may possibly oblige all to live on board a hulk moored at some little distance from the rocky desolate shore. 1 A well-chosen library of about 2,000 volumes goes out with the expedition, and these will be divided between the five Gulf stations. The Amber Witch, which will ply between the stations, will bring letters and papers, and none ot the staff will be kept more than two or three months at a time at one station, so that there will at least be constant change, if there is not much variety. The five stations will be from Karachi to Gwadar, a distance of 250 miles, from Gwadar across the Gulf to the peninsula of Khaaab, from Khasab to Bushahr, and from Bushahr to a place called iao, a small eastern township on the estuary at the mouth of the Euphrates, where the submarine wire meets the land lines which carry it to Baghdad, thence to Mosul (the ancient See sketch at the head of this chapter. Khasab never was used as a cable station.Iti TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. Nineveh), thence to Piarhekir, and thence to Scntavi on the Bosphorus, where it joins a dozen European land routes. r. Ksselbach, so well known among scientific men m tins country for his high attainments, is to be chief superintendent m c large of the whole line, and at his disposal will be a regular staff oi mechanicians, &amp;c., at the head-quarters at Karachi. Ihe reason for 'oing to the great expense and trouble of making five breaks or stations in the Gulf, on a length of 1,200 mi es o wire, is, of course, the great difficulty which would otherwise be experienced in telegraphing through an unbroken circuit o 1 •'(10 miles It was for the same reason that the Malta and Alexandria line was laid in three sections. Electricians are sanguine in their hopes that, in the course of time, and with increased knowledge and experience in submarine cables, this (T r eat difficulty, or rather obstacle, may be mitigated. As ar, however, as present knowledge goes, nothing appears more certain than that messages cannot be sent through long, unbroken circuits of submarine wires with sufficient rapidity and distinctness to make such undertakings commercially profitable, even if there were no risk of loss while being lai across deep seas. Even with the short circuits in which the Persian Gulf line is being laid, Dr. Esselbach is taking out with him some beautiful instruments specially made by Professor Wheatstone, Professor Thomson, Mr. Jenken, and others, in order to mitigate with them the influence of the electric wave in the conductor, which, to a certain extent, will intortere wit rapidity and clearness of telegraphing, even along the wire where the longest unbroken submarine stretch is on &gt; miles.' 1 The article concluded with a hearty wish that Colonel Stewart and his able engineers might achieve that success to which their unwearied care so justly entitled them.

The allure ments of speculation were at this time fast assuming the guise of mania ; and at the Presidency the common talk of almost every table was the share -market. People who had lived half a century, content, in follow ing the quiet piofessional walk which had distinguished and formed so many 'old Indians,'to remain ignorant of the very meaning of stocks, funds, consols and the like, now rushed wildly forward to buy shares without money, and anticipate, often to realize thousands, with out a foundation even in units. ' Back Bay' and 'Land Reclamation ' were the magic words acting as keys to men's hearts and interest ; and those who rue the re membrance of them in these more sober days, will admit existence ot the time when he who cared not to learn the current Shibboleth was regarded as a foreigner, if not positively tabooed. In happy contrast to this prevalence of mammon was a notable movement m the ecclesiastical world, usually so little prominent in Indian official life. The rare occurrence of three Bishops officiating together under one roof could not hut afford a grateful spectacle to all true lovers of the nurch; and at this particular season the Bishop of Calcutta had visited Bombay, in his capacity of Metro politan in India, to meet the two minor Presidency isnops.

Telegraphic communication between England and India was a question calculated to command attention, among the frequenters of the Bombay share-market as elsewhere. As fever produced by brain excitement must always be affected by intelligence bearing on the original cause of malady, so would the Indian patient under the share mania feel deep interest in the creation of a medium by which he could communicate, to home partners or constituents, with a rapidity hitheito un known, fluctuations or other technical signs of immense personal import. And although there were many in India, as in England, who felt honest sympathy with the Government in carrying out a great work of pro gressive civilization and national benefit, without any regard whatever to selfish objects or results, it cannot reasonably be expected that a measure of such prac tical bearing on commercial transactions as the Imlo- European Telegraph should fail to attract the majoiity in a purely utilitarian sense. Upon the whole, then, notwithstanding the share mania and other powerful influences acting upon the public mind, the Persian Gulf Cable Expedition could boast a tolerable, if not an excessive amount of interest in Bombay and the est, as in other parts of India remoter from the actual scene of action.

Karachi is the sea terminus of the Indian Telcgiaph system at the north-west corner of the great Peninsula. Fao, at the head of the Persian Gulf is the sea terminus of the Turkish Telegraph system connected with the systems of Continental Europe and, through them, with England. Karachi is distant from Ffio about 1,250 miles, reckoning the mile by the sea knot. It was intended to join the two by submarine cable laid 111 four sections, in round numbers as follows : Karachi to Gwadar 300 miles; Gwadar to Masandam 400 miles; Masandam to Bushahr 400 miles; Bushahr to Fao 150 miles. The first section, that from Karachi to Gwadar, would be the last laid, as there was a land line already working between the two stations which could be trusted at least as a temporary link in through communication. The first section to be laid would therefore be that from Gwadar to Masandam ; and the ships immediately engaged were to rendezvous on the 4t i February at the former station, whence operations would commence. On the 27th January Colonel Stewart embarked from Ivarachi m the Coromandel steamer, which was placed at Ins disposal in directing proceedings. His brother, taptam Colvin Stewart, accompanied him as personal' assistant; and in the same vessel were Sir Charles Knglit, Colonel Goldsmid, Dr. Esselbach, Mr. A. P. ifouno- aiul Dr. Ponsonby Adair ; the last three being employed respectively as Chief Electrician and General Line Superintendent, Assistant Marine Surveyor, and Medical Mhccr specially attached to the expedition.

Gwadar was vcachcil at an early hour on the 29th ; and although the 1 ohtical officer. Captain Boss, had no large agency m wh.ch o receive his guests, both lie and his amiable paitnei tou always give them a cordial welcome to an English home in Makran. Their abode, something between a , wiss chalet and Crimean hut, had the charm of a baronial hall to the wandering Englishman whom chance or duty led to its threshold, and its inner tidiness was redolent of hospitality. , • , -u The town, or rather village, of Gwadar is built on a sandy isthmus at the foot of an abrupt rocky range projecting far to seaward, rising above the waters to a lieiaht of 400 feet, and forming two bays, which afford good anchorage in depths of from four to six fathoms. Viewing the promontory in its connection with the main land, the length of rock runs east and west, and pre sents a sea front like the head of a hammer to which the isthmus supplies a handle. The bay to the east is well protected in the south-west monsoon, and may be con sidered the natural harbour of Gwadar ; but the wes em bay is equally available in the event of a blow from eastward. Detailed account of the place and its in habitants belongs to the chapter on Baluchistan and Makran coast. It may now, however, be stated that tbe political obstacles to making it a station ha een pro vided for in the Bolitical department; that the - w' Wall, or Governor, worthily seconded his master tie Sultan of Maskat in readiness to cooperate with 11 peaceful enterprise of H.M.

Independently of the main object of this officer's mission, which would remove him temporarily from the Telegraph Expedition, it was endeavoured to improve the occasion to obtain from the shore a native pilot with some knowledge of local soundings; but the inhabitants were unaccustomed to such requisi tions, and admitted possession of no qualifications for compliance. At noon on the 5th February, 75 miles of the cable were laid, and 112 more at half-past 10 a.m . of the day following. This completed the amount in the Kirkham, and the squadron anchored off Ras Mandani or Maidani, a point of jutting lowland between the rivers Rabaj and Sadich, whose mouths form two of the many salt-water creeks distinguishing the Makran coast. On the afternoon of the 7th, the section of cable already laid having been joined to the end of cable in the Marian Moore, the ships again started, the Kirkham returning to Bombay in tow of the Semir amis steamer. At 9.30 a.m . on the Sth the expedition anchored off Eas Jask, near the entrance of the Persian Gulf. From Jask, a course north of north-west is needed to lead into the entrance of the Persian Gulf. But the more direct route chosen for the cable led to the Arabian coast, which here runs abruptly forward into a point, while, on the opposite side, the Persian shores recede into a quasi bay, whereof Bandar Abbas is the centre. A deep-water inlet, known in the chart as ' Malcolm's, had been fixed on as the point of entrance of the cable11 'O ARRIVAL AT MAX AND AM. j ;}5 ships from the eastward, and, without so much as one mile of ^intervening land, a second inlet, the Llphinstone, was to answer a similar purj^ose on the west. Day was passed at the Jask anchorage, so that the Arabian coast might be reached in the morning. Two hundred and sixty-eight miles of cable had been laid when the ships again started. Shortly after mid-day on the 9th the Marian Moore anchored at the appointed landing-place, having raised the figure to 357. On the 13th the shore end was landed.

But this want of material was not t ie sole cause of delay. Political difficulties prc- sen e themselves on the Arabian coast, for the removal o which no adequate provision had been made. A question had arisen as to sovereign control over the is nnus and inlets now under utilisation in the Tele- g r api scheme.

The singular appearance of the Peninsula termi nating, to the northward, the Arabian province of Oman, cannot fail to have struck everyone who has investigated Eastern geography and the charts ot Eastern seas.

A lone; narrow neck which connects the whole with the continent presents no apparent difficulties, whether for traversing or severance ; and as this particular point is reached by the directest and most convenient of theoretical lines indicating the passage of the Indian Telegraph cable from Karachi to Basrah, no wonder that it should have attracted the notice of the vanguard of survev preceding the head-quarters of the actual expedition. But this quaint, irregular figure, which on the map looks so easy of snipping with the scissors of science, is in truth a mass of high, hard rocks ; and when these are considered leisurely and under the in fluence of their heat and sterility, it becomes doubtful whether it would not have been better to have avoided altogether the intricacies of Masandam by keepingin.] COLONEL DISBROWE AT HA BA LAIN. 137 entirely to the opposite coast. After experience lias certainly passed an unmistakable decision against the original selection, though it has in no way impugned the wisdom and expediency which occasioned it under peculiar and urgent circumstances. Colonel Disbrowe, Political Agent at Maskat, had on the 8 th January 1864, in anticipation of Colonel Stewart's arrival with the cable, proceeded to the locali ties which he, intelligibly but in somewhat technical parlance, designated the ' Masandam Districts,' to make inquiries beaung on, and with a view to forward gene rally, the interests of the undertaking. The steamer Victoria had conveyed him to Malcolm's Inlet, and in company with her commander, Lieutenant Arnott, of the Indian Navy, and Lieutenants Pierson and St. John of the Bengal Engineers, he had visited the isthmus of Maklab, the spot marked out by Lieutenant Stiffe for temporarily interrupting the submarine cable by the intervention of a short land line. It had been proposed to substitute here, at a later date, an underground for an aerial tele graph; but the distance under consideration was less than half a mile, and no physical obstructions of con sequence had presented themselves. After re-embarka- tion of the exploring party, the Victoria had re-landed Colonel Disbrowe in another part of the inlet, and ea\iiig him there with a couple of small soldiers' tents, servants and horse, had steamed away, with her remain ing passengers, to Bushahr and Basrah. A brief account of this self-imposed but useful mission is procurable from existing data. The village chosen for preliminary inspection was Habalam, situ ated on the southern side of the inlet and at an easy stance from the recently visited isthmus. It was138 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

Habalain was about 150 paces from the tents, but ofiered few attractions to the European stranger or any of the outer world. I nless rain fell, its water was brackish and undrinkable. Lxeii the thirsty horse rejected the supply first brought, although the Arab inhabitants gave testimony in its favour in continued personal experience. Fortunately there was rain that night, and no inconvenience resulted on the score of drought. Colonel Disbrowe was visited, early on the following morning, by the Chief ot Habalain, a stranger from Sohar, the Mulla of the village, and a group of followers. Accustomed to the indispensable local ceremonies of reception, he treated his visitors to coffee and compli ments, and entered into conversation with them on ordinary topics. He was not prepossessed by the strange assemblage. Seldom had he beheld a more unsightly set. ' Eyes small; noses elongated ; teeth of all shapes, very bad and in no grown-up person complete ; ears protruding ; faces grinning : ' such is his own descrip tion, in hurried pencil notes, of the men of Habalain; and only two of the thirty-four counted had seen an Englishman before the opportunity then offered. After vain attempts to discover a practicable pass for horse and rider across the rocky ranges to the western coast of the Peninsula, so as to reach Khasab, a village which it was proposed to constitute a main emporium for the necessaries of life to the dwellers on the Maklab isthmus. Colonel Disbrowe obtained, on the third day of his sojourn at Habalain, a boat ; and in this heA CROSS THE ISTHMUS. 139 determined to commence operations by revisiting' the isthmus itself. The name ' Maklab ' given to this narrowest strip of the Arabian rocks, on either side of which the waters of the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean respectively roll at a distance of less than half a mile apart, is, translated literally, a 1 place of turning.' In like manner ' Maskat ' is a 'place of falling.' Should either word bear special signification to its object, the analogy would be doubtless derived from volcanic and natural phenomena. Reaching the landing-place in Malcolms Inlet, the party proceeded to cross the isthmus. The Political Agent had shouldered his own saddle-bags, and his st,n ants ^ ere, under instructions, each carrying some thing in accordance with his powers. Two English guns and a ])aluch peons sword were the weapons available in the event of need. About midway the inlet of the Persian Gulf burst in sight, and at this same point the corresponding inlet of the Indian Ocean was still visible behind. The isthmus was traversed in some fifteen or twenty minutes. First an ascent, then comparatively level ground, then a descent to the sea. The ground was not very rugged, save in the immediate vicinity of the landing-places. It was estimated that with fifty or sixty labourers a good broad path might made across in a week. In the Elphinstone Inlet was observed a diminutive island ; and on the main land beyond that island had already been found building sites, and building stone in abundance. Taking boat again on the further side of Maklab, o onel Disbrowe proceeded down the narrow but romantic channel leading to the open sea, to Khasab, a distance of six to seven miles. This lame village is* TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. situated in a broad curve of the promontory running out in a westerly direction from the Arabian Peninsula, below the mouth of the Elphinstone Inlet, and ter minating in the cape called by the Arabs ' Ras Shaikh Masdud.' The landing is an inconvenient process at low water, as there is a flat extending from high water mark under the Fort walls for about three-quarters of a mile into the bay. Not only was it at this awkward period that Colonel Disbrowe arrived, but after sunset; so that it was with considerable difficulty he achieved his purpose, and brought up his incumbrances to the village. The house provided for his reception, however hospitably intended, would have been better fitted to lodge a mermaid visiting terra jirina for the night, than an ordinary British landsman unconnected with amphibia. Its marine odours were overpowering, and drove him to resort to his tent readily pitched outside. Some days passed before the Agent s return to Maskat. From the 14th to the 22nd January he was mainly occupied in the very essential question of finding water and provisions for a supposed Felegraph Station at Maklab. As regards both these necessaries he arrived, moreover, at practical results, and was able to report in tolerable detail. 1 This preliminary exploration had not, however, availed to ensure a satisfactory reception to the cable ships and their passengers on the part of the Arabs in the vicinity of the, isthmus. Colonel Stewart an other officers of the expedition had made a few presents on arrival to the chiefs, or pretended chiefs, who first showed themselves, but the cupidity of these orientals 1 Colonel Disbrowe to Lieut.-Colonel Stewart.

There was clearly no honest work to be got tor money and fair dealing from the inhabitants; iUkI on the 13th February, when the young Director General of the Telegraph, eager for progress and impa tient of irrelevant obstacles, was on shore with one or two shipmates, the jealousy, avarice, and discontent aroused by the well'meant liberality which had been, exercised, culminated in a regular Irish row. It appeared that a number of persons from Fillam, a neighbouring village, attracted by the report of strange arrivals and in the hope of sharing in further largesses, had come over to Maklab to reconnoitre. This deputation had alarmed the Arabs of the more immediate neighbourhood, who had naturally been first in the field ; and the Shaikhs of Mukaka, a village, like Hahalain, within walking distance of the isthmus, came over intent on resisting any participation in a plunder the sweets of which they had already tasted. By misapprehension of identity the Fillamites were selected to form the first working party in British pay, and the selection excited the anger of their rivals to the highest pitch. Nor was the clamour appeased by correction of error committed. The well-meant counter-choice of Mukaka invoked the direst wrath of disappointed Fillam. All t'ttort at conciliation was vain. Neither one nor the other side would listen to reason. Words produced lows, and some of these blows, inflicted with sticks, with which the disputants were freely armed, came own upon the victims with savage force and meaning, ne man who had been singled out by Colonel Stewart as 'i builder, and apparently the only competent man «yiph■ 142 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. for the duty, was furiously handled for entering into an arrangement irrespective ot his avaricious connades. Et was evident that the expedition had become mixed up with a wild, turbulent lot, who preferred club law to any amount of reason, and that, unsuppoitod by acknowledged authority, the Telegraph Officers would have a difficult game to play. Mere conciliation was out of the question. It was useless to attempt it under the circumstances. All that could be done at the moment was to trust to the shipping, and to work on shore with such few hands as could be spared for preliminary clearing and building, and for protecting the few stores which it was necessary to land. Covetous of everything the English intruder might possess, up to the shirt on his back, these unpre possessing natives were jealous of each other, in the matter of gifts, as dogs with a stray bone. The one privileged person in each village was the Shaikh, but one false Shaikh begat fifty, and every Shaikh had a host of relatives striving to profit by the consanguinity. The village of Mukaka presented a notable instance of this squabbling and cupidity ; but then, Mukaka was the near point, and what had been seen ot Pillam did not lead to the supposition that its civilization was of a higher order. 1 But there was a doubt as to the authority, if indeed any, acknowledged by these Masandam Arabs. Some openly disavowed subjection to the Sultan of Maskat, and admitted no chief but Sultan Bin Sagar, the old ex-pirate of Ras-el-Khaima. Others gave vague and 1 While these pages are going through the press, the kindness of the Bombay Government has enabled me to supply Colonel Stewart's own account of proceedings on the day of our landing at Maklab.

Then again, south of the isthmus was the whole Arabian Peninsula. On the 15th February, Colonel Disbrowe, steaming in from Maskat, joined Colonel Stewart, who at once explained in writing the difficulties of his position. 1 The following entry was made in my journal at Baghdad in 1864, after looking into the Rev. Charles Forster's Historical Geography of Arabia which I casually took from the Political Agent's bookcase 'As I could have wished, Avhen journeying and journalising in Makran, that Dr. Went had been present to prove or disprove his philological and archaeological results and theories, so could I wish that Mr. Forster were eposited at Masandam, to make deductions on the names of places and ethnology of races found upon that singular Peninsula.

Desirous of taking advantage of the interval which mm elapse before the return from Bombay ot the steamers with the cable ships in tow, to visit the (lulf Stations of Bushahr and Fao, he could not leave the Masandam anchorage without the certain knowledge that some officer was left behind competent and authorized to act in any emergency that might arise in dealing with the Arabs. The brief but material experience of the locality o-ained since his first arrival had proved to him how necessary it was that every precaution should be taken against the petty collisions which were inevitable with out the most careful and constant superintendence. 1 but unfortunately the Political Agent had brought with him from head-quarters no solution to the pioblem of local sovereignty.

Eventu ally it was decided that Colonels Disbrowe and Stewart should proceed together to Maskat, and either obtain from the Sultan the required authority, or sufficient data on which to act without it. Colonel Goldsmid would, in the meanwhile, with Mr. Isaac Walton, Mr. Hirz, and one or two members of the Telegraph stall, remain in tents on the isthmus.

Od the one hand, the visit to the Sultan had enlisted his active interest in the cause of the expedition, although the authority obtained, and under which the refractory Arabs were to be treated, was not very distinct or conclusive. His Highness had confirmed his own previous professions of good-will and assistance, and was ready to exert his own influence to any extent on behalf of her Majesty's Government. On the other hand, the Arabs of Masandam had become more accus tomed to the presence of Englishmen bent on a work which could not harm any of them, and might be the means of benefiting such of their number as were well- disposed enough to co-operate. The chiefs and their followers had been troublesome and intrusive, as antici pated ; and it had been necessary to deprive at least one offensive Shaikh of the entree to the Maklab encamp ment. A threatening letter had, moreover, succeeded the act, professedly sent by the hill Bedouins with a view to favour certain claimants to the land occupied, and perhaps to extort more presents, and the messenger was to return for an answer. But they understood the character and objects of their visitors all the better from these proceedings and their results; and this was just what was required for the success of the Telegraph cause. Although the electric wire would find its way by means of an aerial line across the isthmus, it was resolved to make the Telegraph Station as far as practicable independent of the more inquisitive than inviting Arabs of the hills and villages. Accordingly the Elphinstone Island in the inlet of the same name was fixed upon as a fitting site for the offices and residence of employes. rhis spot, before alluded to, had already attracted l14G TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap attention. Notwithstanding its miniature size, it stood conveniently in the way between the Maklab place of landing and mouth of the inlet, and was only distant from the former about one-third of a mile. Three weeks passed from the date of return of the Covoiuciudel to Maklab and the renewal of cable operations. During this time much was accomplished in improving the position, politically and generally, and much in providing water, provisions and building materials, and towards the establishment of a standing bazar for the contemplated Masandam Station. One Musa of Maskat, filling with admirable tact and cleverness the respective offices of agent, interpreter, pedlar, contractor, or envoy, according to circumstances, was sedulously engaged in the last-named undertaking, and his endeavours promised to be crowned with success. Short notices of excursions, made at this time by the present writer to Mukaka, Fillam, and across the Gulf to Basiduh, may be here introduced in illustration of the places and people, without irrelevancy to the narrative of the cable. In the north-east corner, then, of the irregularly shaped isthmus joining the still more irregularly shaped peninsula commonly known as Masandam to the Arabian continent, is the village of Mukaka. Ihe bay in which it is situated is reached through one out of many indentations of rocky coast, and is part of a deep, broad, land-locked inlet called by the natives ' Ghubbeb Ghazireh.' This is our ' Malcolm's Inlet; ' whereas the ' Elphinstone Inlet, on the opposite or western side of the isthmus, is known by the Arabs as ' Khor-es-Shem. The village, like many others in this ungenial quarter, is built on the slope of a rocky hill. The houses are con structed of stone walls loosely thrown up, without'i-j mukaka revisited 14 / plaster or cement, with Hat roofs of planks surmounted by stones also. A small space is built out and levelled in front of each dwelling, but there are no long lines of streets, nor is there anything corresponding to the Indian 'angan' or compound. Dr. Adair and Colonel Gold- smid visited the place on the 2nd March, starting at about U a.m . Ihe walk was a long one, and the road very rough at times, now in the more fertile-Iookino- hollows, now skirting the hills. The sea views were really beautiful; and the village as beheld from the height, and descended upon, as it were, over the tops of its houses, was far from wanting in picturesque interest. Saiyid Muhammad, the Baghdad Munshi, went forward to notify the approach of visitors to Abid, relative and locum tenons of the temporarily absent Shaikh, Suliman. But the inhabitants had already espied the strangers and in vited them by signals and cries to draw near. The women «eie especially loud in exclaiming ' taal,' or 'come.' Abid himself, a rather square-built, sombre, middle-aged man, shortly appeared, and led the way to his own hut.

It was, however, thought equally probable that he had gone to consult with Sultan Bin Sagai of Ras-el-Khaima. And, as it afterwards became hinted that this aged chief had advised the Masandam Arabs to assist rather than impede the objects of the Telegraph Expedition, there was good ground for such supposition. The day following the visit to Mukaka, several Arabs from Khasab, Mukaka, and Fillam came on board the ships and stayed for a considerable time.

The village, though at no great distance from Maklab by land and as the crow flies, is reached easily only by water, but then the water journey is one of several miles. Tiehind it is a mountain, the peak of which is estimated at 2,500 feet high. This height, how ever exceptional for the actual promontory of Masan- dam, is surpassed by the Arabian mountains immediately below the Maklab isthmus, one of which is recorded as 4,470, one as 5,800, and one as 6,750 feet; while on the opposite Persian coast, behind Bandar Abbas, one moun tain rises to 7,G90, one to 8,500, and one to 10,660 feet. The course from Maklab was about S.S.E. till the rocks were reached east of the Malcolm Inlet, when the boat worked gradually round to the X.N.E., and entered the wide and sheltered inlet in which is the bay of Fillam, sighting the village on the low sandy ground at foot of the Sibi hill. To the westward, and almost opposite Fillam Bay, is the village of Mansul, the second or alternative season settlement of the Fillamites. Such is Shem to the inhabitants of Kana in the Elphinstone, and Habalain to Mukaka in the Malcolm Inlet. The boatmen were civil, but had no sooner rounded the point fairlv shutting out the telegraph isthmus and anchorage, than thev declared themselves to be subjects of Sultan Bin Sagar, and quite independent of the Sultan of Maskat.

Ihere was no crowd or empressement; but after a time, a rusty old dismounted gun was fired, and the Shaikhs or quasi-Shaikhs appeared. To his astonish ment Colonel Goldsmid recognized acquaintances among his hosts, one a very conspicuous leader in the dis^ turbances on the isthmus. This last, moreover, by name Abdullah, was pointed out as the head Shaikh, and to his care he consigned himself. He led the way to a covered outhouse by the village, where a mat was spread for the visitor, and where the ceremony of salutation, sitting and conversation, was held. After a time the Shaikh went to prayers, and others followed. The women and children remained, staring and commenting on their strange guest, few of whose countrymen had ever been seen before in that locality, and none perhaps sitting among them. Praj^ers seemed to last unusually long; but this circumstance might have been occasioned by the day being Friday, the Musalman sabbath. Upon the whole, the visitor was not sorry to take leave : there ^•as a constraint on the part of the Arabs which they knew not how to overcome : they were at a loss what to o t0 ex press their feelings, evidently sore with reference to recent events ; and yet the general intentions appeared hospitable. The passage from Maklab lasted about two hours and a half; something less than an hour was spent « Fillam ; and another two hours and a half may be aoded for the return.

On the 12th March the Zenohia brought in the 2 weed, with 352 miles of cable, to the Elphinstoue Inlet; and leaving her important charge in the anchorage, again steamed off, under instructions, on active duty. She was to fill up with coal, as early as practicable, at Basi- duh, the old naval depot in the Persian Gulf. Comman der Bradshaw, R.N., and a party of telegraph officials were on board, and they were now joined by Colonel Goldsmid. Early in the morning of the 13th they were off Lingah on the Persian coast, or about 90 miles N.N.W. of the Elphinstoue Inlet, and about 25 miles in a westerly direction from Basiduh. Here is stationed a so-called British agent, usually a native of the country ; but as he had not put in an appearance up to 11 a.m . and there was work to be done, and information to be acquired on shore.

While the attendant was searching for the agent, the inhabitants of Lingah flocked round the European stranger. The scene was a curious one, for there were faces &amp; and forms of many kinds and from many quarters.

Persian was the language used, and its easy, melodious vocabulary was a delightful change from the jargon of Masandam. Again, the behaviour of the people was not like that of the uncouth semi-barbarians of the opposite coast, or indeed the semi-civilized nondescripts of many parts of India. Among other topics of conversation brou-ht forward, questions were asked on the American war ; and surprise was manifested at the telegraph scheme and its success up to Khasab, as they called the Masandam station. After a time the messenger returned, and the scene changed to the interior of the house of the Shaikh of Lingah. This official was a young Arab of apparently live or six and-twenty, slim, and of middle height, with a face which might have been well-looking had it not been deeply and plentifully scarred with pock-marks. He proffered the Kalian in the Persian fashion; and two or three whiffs of this were followed by cakes and excel lent coffee. To the visitors the ceremony had an in trinsic value, as, on this particular occasion, biscuits had served the purpose of the day's breakfast. After a few words had been exchanged on the subject of boats and ire, coals and coolies, the visit concluded. The ctuiu trip to the steamer was over a heavy sea, and she a 7 ar off the shore.

A short distance from the old town, and near the sea-beaeh, is a square-looking mound of respeetable height and dimen- sions, on the east and west sides of which is a tower, or the debris of a tower, erected probably by the townspeople after the departure of the Portuguese, as a means of defence against the pirates. The Point is a prolongation of generally level ground with stony surface, having a slope towards the sea, which washes it, some twenty 'feet or more below, on the north and west.

Another matter discussed at Lingah had been more successful in practical result; it was the hiring boats, or ' baglas,' to carry supplies of coal for the steamers to be employed up the Gulf, The demand had been noised abroad, and many candidates now offered themselves for the service. The Shaikh's terms seemed rather high, but a standard rate of 4 annas or about sixpence a ton, accomplished the hire of three baglas, one at 90, one at 80, and one at 50 tons, on a guarantee of employment for at least fifteen days' On the 16th March, the Dalhousie, Victoria, and Semiramis arrived at Basidnh, all for coaling. The day after the Zmobia, with a bagla in tow, left on her return to the Elphinstone Inlet. The Persian Gulf has not a good reputation for climate.

Of the pleasantest kind is the recollection of its shore reunions, in March 1864, when, the dinner over, a move was made from the social table to the still more social fireplace, and pipes and cigars gave zest to conversation over cheery, flaming logs or glowing char- cod And on these occasions, the presence of an amiable ostess invested the home colours of the picture with a right reality.

On the 13th March, the sister cable-ship Assaye had been brought in by the ; and the Victoria had arrived on the same day, towing the Hat Haidarabad. This last was designed as a temporary floating station for Fao, the proposed terminus of the submarine line, at the head of the Persian Gulf On the 14th, the Dalhousie had brought in the two hulks, Euphrates and Constance, with their decks roofed in and otherwise fitted up for moving and immediate use at the Masandam station. The three steamers aforesai had then been despatched to Basiduh, the Semrams takinf out the Assaye from the anchorage at the inlet, and dropping her in the roadstead off Lingah, there to remain during the operation of coaling The Zenobia then on return to head-quarters, would find but one steamer, the Coroimndel, to co-operate in immediate active proceedings. During; the days of unavoidable delay at Masandam, some members of the Expedition had found time for the natural diversion of boating and shooting. The hrst derived a special charm from the wild and novel beauties presented in the scenery of the inlets, and the many little explorations of which the panorama was suggestive.

In no part of the whole line from Masandam to Bushahr is the depth greater than 55 fathoms, and the average of the whole may be taken at about 38 fathoms; the depths diminishing as the head of the Gulf is approached. On board the cable-ship, the arrangements and appliances of every kind were so perfect that the cable was passed out with the regularity of clockwork, only sufficient strain being applied to prevent the loss of unnecessary slack. ' On first starting, and throughout the night of the 18th, the cable was paid out at a uniform rate of from 5 to 5^ miles per hour. At 6.30 a.m . on the 19th, the ships were abreast of great Tumb Island, and distant from it about 4 miles to the north ; a slight detotcr having been made to avoid a place where the sound ings were known to be somewhat irregular. At this period the Assaya was sighted in the distance as she lay at anchor off Lingah; and as some portion of the cable she carried was required to complete the connection with Bushahr, the Coro- mandel at once turned northwards to pick up and take her in tow, while a messenger was despatched in a native boat to Basiduh, with orders for the Semiramis to follow as soon as her coaling was complete. ' At about 2 p.m ., a head wind from the W.N.W. sprang up, and treshened during the afternoon and evening of the 19th suffi ciently to retard considerably the progress of the cable-ship, the rate of paying out being at one time reduced to about 2^ miles per hour. With darkness, however, the breeze moderated, the ormer rate of progress was resumed, and at 11 a.m . on the 20th, when abreast of Shilwar, 177 miles of cable had been paid out', giving an average since starting of about 4J miles per hour for ie whole distance traversed. From this time until the whole of e * miles on board the Tweed were expended, the weather on mued most favourable, and operations progressed with per ect legularity and success, the cable passing out at about 5-^ ^perliour throughout. At 8 p.m . on the 21st, the vessels p p C 0re s 0me 3o miles south of Bushahr, off a point on the a 11 Coast known as the ' A sses' Ears.' During the following m ! I f®telegraph and travel. fcH.vr, ^ ^ |l t % day, the 22nd, the splice between the end oi the cable just sub merged from the Tweed, and that still on board the Assaye, was effected, while the artificers and stores were transferred from the former to the latter vessel. After everything was completed the ships lay at anchor till 2 a.m . on the 23rd, the recommencement of operations being thus postponed until an hour that ensured the arrival of the vessels off Bushahr by daylight. « J should here explain that during the time the ships thus lay at anchor, as well as at intervals during the whole of the previous operations of submerging the cable, we could at any time communicate through it by telegraph with the stations m our rear. Intimation was in this manner received of the arrival at Masandam of the repairing steamer Amberwitch, and also of her immediate departure, in obedience to instructions, to join the expedition. It thus happened that we were enabled to calculate on the presence of this vessel on the 22nd, and at once intended on her arrival to make use of her in piloting the Zenohia and Assaye to their anchorage near Bushahr, the position of which Lieut. Stiffe's previous survey of the coast enabled him to take up with accuracy. As the Semiramis had not yet appeared from Basiduh, the Coromandel now towed the empty Tweed towards Bushahr, all the vessels starting together at about 2 am. on the 22nd, and reaching the anchorage within sight of the city at 9 a.m . on the 23rd. The position thus taken up by the vessels of the expedition was much to the south of the usual anchorage, being abreast of, and about 3 miles from, the point previously selected for landing the cable. The latter spot is fully 6 miles south of the city of Bushahr, and close to the northern angle of the old fort of Eeshir, and here, close to the beach, Lieut.- Colonel Felly, to whom I had previously written on the subject, had kindly prepared a small camp. « During the 23rd, the coast line in the neighbourhood ol tlie landing-place was carefully examined by Sir C. Bright and my self, the exact spot for the cable decided on, and arrangements completed, with Colonel Felly's assistance, for cutting a trenc i from the beach along the face of the soft sand-stone rock, an into the interior of one of the tents, which in the mean- wMA SA NDA M- B US H A Hli ('A BL E. 163 time was converted into a temporary office, with all requisite testing and signalling apparatus. At the same time, orders were given and acted on with the greatest promptness for under taking the various additions and alterations required for the provision of a permanent office, and for the accommodation of the staff in the city itself. A double land-line of telegraph, to connect the cable with the. proposed permanent office, was com menced, and a masonry building, to serve as 'Junction House' and testing house at lieshir, was designed, and the permission of the Persian Governor of the Province obtained for its im mediate construction. 'In all that related to the permanent location of the office andstaif, I was glad to adopt the ideas the resident's.experience ' suggested. And I should add, that having explained to Colonel Pelly, on my first arrival, how important it was that no time should be lost in completing the short remaining section of the line, from Pmshahr to Fao, during the continuance of the favourable weather we enjoyed, I was enabled, through the cordial assistance received from him, to complete ^0°whole of the shore arrangements, both for the temporary and per manent offices, during the time necessarily occupied in bringincr he extremity of the cable to land. It was mainly owin^ to is that so satisfactory a result was achieved as the departure o the Expedition, and the recommencement of operations on he third section of the line, within little more than three days it T t ^ BUShahr - T0 retUrn ' h0Wever ' t0 the P^ess work; I should explain that the preparations for landing end of the cable from the larger vessels, from which the tZX a POr i tl0n IS 1 laid ' oftei1 de mand a great deal of fore- Zul ^r s i e T ion - 0n this occasion ifc was —t for all 1 A ^rmtch f thoroughly equipped as she was work h! 1 0P 1 e f ratl0 i nS ' arrived in tinie t0 tflkc Part in the within a ^ 'f' 101 ' drau g ht of water enabled her to approach ^Z JZ r mile 0f the ^-Pfcce. while the »ot Dnri * amecl ' ,lacl t0 ei^hor some three miles 24th ' the t0tal len S th -ble ach the shore, was transferred from the Assaye, m 2 id ii i JB 4*' I MM I ii: m. ? f null' 1 si'' I' 'telegraph and travel. 1(54 2|- miles being coiled down in the Amhencitch, thus using hev special machinery for the first time, and proving by ea f e and success with which the work was accomplished, that the time and trouble devoted to perfecting her equipment in Lug- land had not been expended in vain. Shortly alter sunset, the cable was joined up to the instruments in the temporary oftice on shore; its condition was ascertained to be perfect, and 1 had the great satisfaction of being enabled to forward at once to Bombay a telegraphic report of the successlul completion of another section of the line. 'On the 25th, no time was lost in repeating the operations of the previous day, by landing from the Asmye one end of the cable which was still on board that vessel, and part of which was now to be laid from Bushabr onwards to Fao. Before pro ceeding, however, to recount the laying of the last section o the line, I should explain, that in approaching the head of the aulf the shallower soundings I have before spoken ol had been reached On no part of the proposed course, from Bushahr to the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, is a deeper sounding than 30 fathoms to be found. 1 While for fifty miles to the south east of Fao, the depths (varying from twenty fathoms at m distance, to four fathoms at a few miles from land ) ^ places small enough to give rise to risk of injury to the cab from anchors of native craft. It was clearly desirable, theretoro, in approaching Fao, to select a line that would give the cable the security of the greatest available depth of water. « The careful examination thus required of this part ot sea -bed, was one of the main objects of mission to the Gulf, in the beginning of 1863.

He was also directed to ascertain the best practical method of marking off the exact course, with buoys or beacons, previous to laying the cable. Lieut. Stifle's preliminary survey at once established the existence of a continuous channel leading downwards from the Klior Abdullah, through the shallower soundings already referred to. And now that the cable was ready to be submerged, it only remained to mark off this gut in such a way that the ships might make for the lower extremity and pass along the line of deeper soundings found in its somewhat tortuous channel. The Amber witch, which would otherwise have been selected for duty of tins kind, being required to land the second shore- end at Bushahr, the Victoria, with Lieut. Stiffe on board, was* despatched on the 25th with instructions to proceed to the Khor Abdullah (after leaving the flat Hyderabad at anchor within the bar), and then to work back along the channel before referred to, placing flag-buoys at the requisite intervals for clearly defining the course, and coming out to seaward either till meeting the cable ships or till reaching soundings of 17 fathoms. In the atter case, the Victoria was to anchor and await the cable ships, holding herself in readiness to weigh on their arrival, and to pilot them in along the course thus marked out, while the Amhcncitch was to follow, picking up the flag-buoys when these were no longer required. All tins was done, exactly as proposed. The second connec tion Wl th the shore having been successfully completed on the i, t ie cable ships left the anchorage south of Bushahr at a p.m ., and soon after dawn, on the following day, the Victoria j\as sighted lying at anchor some miles to the south-east of ao. The instructions above referred to had been most ably carried out by Lieutenants Stiffe and Arnott, the latter of whom ^ m command of the Victoria, and the cable was thus paid ou e remainder of the distance, along a buoyed channel most mirably adapted for its reception, and affording a depth of ol n gI ' eatcr throil ghout (by from four to eight fathoms) than ii otherwise have been obtained. At 9 p.m . on the 27th the 6 s anchored in the Khor Abdullah, in five fathoms of water,telegraph and travel. [chap. due south of Fao, the condition of the cable, as shown by the tests, being most excellent, and the communication with Gwadar and Karachi perfect. ' It was not till the following day, that the difficulties still to be encountered in landing the shore-end and connecting the cable with the Turkish lines were fully appreciated. Daylight showed, at a distance of ten or twelve miles to the north, a line of shore so low as scarcely to be visible. Ihis line consisted, as we afterwards found, partly of distant date-gardens seen through mirage, and partly of the different ' bands or ' sads, but for which, the whole of the low spit, on which the Arab huts and enclosures at Fao have sprung up, would be liable to occasional inundation. On one side of this spit, is the tidal estuary of the Shatt-el-Arab, on the other, the extensive inlet known as the Khor Abdullah, and in which the ships of the Expedition then lay. ' So far as facility for first establishing the Telegraph was concerned, nothing would have been simpler than to have laid the cable across the bar, and up the Shatt-el-Arab to the terminus of the Turkish land lines at Fao, which is easily accessible, and can be closely approached on that side by sea-going vessels. The cable, so laid, must, however, have been continually liable to accidental injury from the anchors of vessels navigating the Shatt-el-Arab. And it was in order to avoid this serious risk, that the safer, though much more difficult, approach by the Khor Abdullah was decided on. 'From the anchorage of the larger vessels it was soon ascertained that the Amberwitch might move in, some three or four miles towards Fao, on the Khor Abdullah side; and that for perhaps two miles further, the cable might be laid from vessels or boats of still smaller draught of water, but lor the remainder of the distance, it was evidently impossible to provide for the laying of the cable in any of the ordinary modes. In order to examine the ground to be traversed, Sir Charles Brig it. Colonel Goldsmid, Captain Bradshaw, and myself started m the Victoria on the 28th, and passing round to the bar entrance of the river, steamed up the Shatt-el-Arab to ao,B USHA IIR-FA 0 CA BLE. 1g7 where we found tlie river steamer Comet at anchor, with Mr. Johnstone, Yice-Consul at Basrah, on board. ' It was here that we first learned the true state of the case regarding progress made on the Turkish land-line from lao to Baghdad. This line had been completed from Fao, along the right or western bank of the river to Kurna, a distance of 100 miles, when the complications with the Montefik Arabs put a stop to all further progress from the south. In a tent close to the edge of the river at Fao, a temporary office had been established at the terminus of this line; and at the time of our arrival, this office was in communication with Basrah. ' Our first object, of course, was to bring the cable from the Khor Abdullah, across the intervening tracts of water, shoal, and mud, to this temporary office, and the requisite preliminary survey was at once commenced. The result went to prove that the difficulties to be encountered were of no ordinary character. To make this clear, however, I must explain that in calm weather, and with any ordinary tide, some three or four miles of the almost perfectly level 1 mud to the south of iao (towards the Khor Abdullah), is uncovered at high water, and a further extent of H or 2 miles at low water, while the bottom slopes so gradually that not even small boats can at any time approach within less than half a mile of the uncovered portion. Strong wind from the south-east, however, is always suffi cient to bring the sea at high water, over the whole extent, up even to the date gardens at Fao itself. And the result of this is, to reduce to a soft, greasy mud, in which one sinks deep at eveiy step, the whole of the surface that may previously have taen dried and hardened by the sun. Bad as the portions thus become that are only occasionally flooded, they are as nothing compared to the wretched and almost impassable tract lying between ordinary higli-water mark, and the point where boats ^rst ground when coming in towards the shore. In parts of this, those who were employed in landing the cable, sank so eeply, wh^j*standing upright, that they were compelled, as the 0 nly piacticable mode of progression, to throw themselves down, and to crawl like turtle over the half liquid mud.telegraph and travel. [chap. ' AVlien this tract was first crossed, by Sir C. Bright and myself, a few days only before the cable was actually bioughtin, there was comparatively little difficulty in landing, but a strong south-easterly wind, occurring in the interval, had flooded the Hats to an unusual extent, and increased all the difficulties most seriously. 'The method ultimately adopted tor landing the cable was this: A sufficient length to extend from the point where the Amberwitch was compelled to anchor in approaching the shore, to a point perhaps a quarter of a mile above the mean high- water mark, was coiled away in the paddle-box boats of the Zenohia, and paid out in the direction of the shore. On reaching their own draught of water, these boats were still pushed on, as far as possible, over the softer parts oi partially flooded mud, and the cable ultimately left in them, was then turned over in a bight and carried or dragged by manual labour, until extended in' a straight line as far in shore as it would reach. The Amberwitch with several miles of cable on board (forming part of the same length thus landed from the boats), afterwards steamed out to where the Assaye lay, paying out the cable as she went and joining the extremity to that of the Bushahr cable which had previously been buoyed and shipped from the Assaye. ' The operation thus described, did not, however, take place until the 5th April, nor until the work of completing the remaining portion of the line, through the long stretch of mud flats leading up to Fao, had also been provided for in the following manner:— ' About 4 miles of cable were transferred on the 31st March from the Assaye to the river steamer Comet, and conveyed in her from the Khor Abdullah to a point near the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, about a mile to the south of Fao, where it was cut into lengths, and landed piecemeal, each length weighing about five tons and measuring more than a mile. ' These lengths were then successively carried or dragged, hy manual labour, across the flats to that part of the line whue each portion was required.III.] INDIA LINKED WITH TURKEY. IfiO ' At first examining the ground on the 28th March, I had airanged, with the A ice-Consuls assistance, that all the available Arab population ol the neighbourhood, numbering some 300 men, should be got together and employed daily till the comple tion of the woik. As a first operation these men were set to work to dig a trench 2£ feet deep for the cable, which was to extend through the mud flats from Fao for upwards of 3J miles to the proposed landing place in the Khor Abdullah. Colonel Goldsmid . . . volunteered to direct this work, and at once took up his quarters in a tent on the mud flats. On the 30th March, Captain Bradshaw joined him and undertook the control of the working parties employed in dragging across the flat the several short sections of cable, as each was landed from the Comet. ' In this way the total length required for the shore connec tions, weighing no less than 16 tons in all, was at last brought into position, the several lengths carefully joined and spiked, and the whole covered in, in the bottom of the wet trench above referred to. ' On the 8th April the connection between the Submarine Cable and the temporary office at Fao was completed; and the pledge long before entered into by the British Government, to connect the Indian with the Turkish Lines, was at length fulfilled.' 1 The diary of one of the officers named in the above extracts will form an appropriate supplement to the narrative of proceedings at Fao.

Could it be that I understood aright, and that here was a man wishing me to aid him in getting rid of a fellow-creature, that he might become possessed of his wife? And yet he looked a mere clown, and his face bore no clear sign of vice, I expressed repugnance at the notion, and would have no more to say to him. He tried to renew the conversation, and asked for a little gunpowder. This I refused in a manner to show that its appli cation was mistrusted. He over and over again assured me that it was required merely for shooting birds, but to no avail. I asked this man's name in order to note him. War-dance this evening. Endeavoured to keep the Arabs of the right bank from those of the Persian side of the river, as flags were hoisted by either party, and a row threatened. 'April 1.—Visited by J. and A. at our encampment this morning. Our night in the tent was tolerable, but the smell of rank seaweed, or something similar, and a strong wind near my bed kept me wakeful. The wind setting in from the S.E. causes us to strike the tent in the afternoon, and remove to the Fort. Had some idea of selecting ground outside the walls, but the overflow from the river, as also a wish to prove the Fort as a dwelling-place, overrule it.

It is not, however, deeply imbedded, and a strong north-wester might send it in our direction.

Set to work with and by dint of encouragement in various forms manage to get in about a quarter of a mile from the head of the trench before striking work, but not to imbed it altogether : Mr. N., engineer of the Comet, and the three Europeans, all lending a hand with efficiency. They thought I allowed the Arabs to knock off work too soon ; but my ideas differ trom theirs on the subject. These men must be humoured for an emergency, and the present work is emergent. We cannot treat emergencies as every-day occurrences ; nor do we as a rule. They were paid their rupee, and told that the double wages should not be given to-morrow, if the whole cable were not imbedded. Directed for to-morrow the labourers to be divided in three parties; one to the right under E., the foreman, who was to superintend laying the cable in the trench as it came up; one in the centre under W.; and one to the left under the foreman's two assistants. Endeavoured to dissuade these honest Europeans from risking health and liie by hoiking in li 0 ht forage caps under a burning sun. Number of labourers entere at 229, one more than yesterday. We must hasten our wor , for the south-easters are setting in and bring up the water to a great extent.

We had just finished laying the whole of our piece and disposing of a superfluous length, for which there was no room in the trench, when we descried the occupants of the boats trying to land their burden. The sight was curious. They got into the water, perhaps up to the middle; but the footing was so uncertain that they were compelled, after a time, to crawl. Such figures as they eventually appeared baffle description. There were S., Sir C. ?»., VV., and others. Having brought in the cable to a certain point, they left it with the splicers, and with an intimation that two rupees (four shillings) would be given to those men who would bring the two ends together—that is, the sea-end to the shore-end. The distance Mas not great, but the work was by no means easy. 1 gave the signal, passed the word for double wages, and down came the Arabs like a volley of grape. Into the water they plunged, and at last seized the looked-for cable. They slipped -they floundered—but kept bravely at work; till a heavy thunderstorm came on, which seemed to shake them in their resolution. The lightning flashed vividly, though in broad day; the rain fell in immense drops; at length the struggling Arabs gave way and abandoned the cable, at, perhaps, three hundred yards short ot the mark of junction ! 'April 6.—Go down with Sir C. B. in the morning to the sea-shore—he to make his way to the Amherwitch, I to dispose of the workmen. No Arabs collected at the tents where had arranged to meet them with the previous day's wages ; nor had they gone down to the scene of the unfinished work of t ie evening. The whole party were found just where they were not required, in the middle of the trench, busily engaged in the easy occupation of throwing earth over the imbedded cable. • • • -^ever had I a much more difficult piece of diplomacy to execute than now. It was quite a scene.

They are in my tent. But this is not what I had hoped to see.' Sent for the money to the tent in the Fort; but still they were sulky. Moving away from the Persian clique, who professed to be disobedient on compulsion only, not daring to act without the consent of the Arabs, I addressed myself at length to the latter. The great diffi culty seemed to be the continuance of work when once they had got in the cable. The matter was very urgent; the splicers had come down with their tools, men available for the work were drawn together on the spot: I agreed to give the rupee on com pletion of this particular duty. Instantly a marvellous activity was evident In the crowd. They stripped themselves half naked, sprang rather than ran their mile or more to the well-known spot, regardless of mud and waves, quickly found the cables end, and brought in their charge with a war-dance. I handed it to the splicers, and thus was Turkish Arabia linked to Bombay!' There was yet more cable to be buried in the inner line of ditch which had been continued towards the Fort; and a small section would thence be required to unite it to the land-line ; and although the final touches to the work would not need the same close and active super intendence as at the outset, the two original superinten dents would have to pass a night or two more in tlie small tent within the low walls.

Meeting the argument as applying to territorial space, I pointed out to him that England was rich in outlying possessions, and instanced Hindustan as au un deniable argument in favour of her power and greatness.'

Men in physical strength and build, children in mind and morale, with notions which must be strange, and, in certain cases, repugnant to civilization, they would soon make admirable soldiers, if not quite trust worthy men. But in this latter respect much might be said on their behalf, in excuse for the present, and m hope for the future. If the remarkable grouping and precision of the war-dance tell a talc of habitual feud and feudal organization, the fact that this same war- dance affords an outlet to exuberance of temper, and may be resorted to in such sense, when calmer deliberation would result in violence, is evidence of a more satisfac tory kind. The enemies of ordinary life in the civilized world would perhaps find a safer vent to their bitterness by dancing off incipient animosities, than in resorting to the more common yet scarcely more dignified way of cherishing them by libel and misrepresentation. Before concluding the present chapter it will be well to record the discovery and correction of an early flaw in the cable. This became apparent in the short section between Fao and Bushahr on the second day after the arrival of the vessels in the Khor Abdullah. It was ex plained by Colonel Stewart as follows . 1 Arabic, ' Get on.' ! Persian, 41 Pull hard.'hi.] FLAW IN THE FAO-BUSHAHR SECTION. 179 'The copper conductor adopted in the Persian Gulf cable differs considerably from any previously used. Though ap parently a single solid wire, it is in reality composed of four different longitudinal pieces, arranged within and exactly fit ting an outer cylindrical tube. These different component parts are fitted together in the manufactory, so as to form a short, thick rod, which is afterwards lengthened out into wire while being rolled or drawn down to the required diameter. 'The manufacture of wire such as this, on a large scale, was entirely no\ el; more than one important improvement was introduced soon after commencing the work, and tended, bv increasing the toughness of the wire, to reduce the probability of fracture in the conductor: but in that part of the cable which was first manufactured (and which was ultimately included in the length laid from Bushahr to Fao), these improvements were wanting. It now appears that in the earlier processes of manu- factuiing the cable, and probably before the core left the works of the Gutta-percha Company, the conductor must at one point in this section have been broken across accidentally. But as the broken ends remained in contact, the electrical continuity of the conductor was unaffected, until when the cable was sub merged, the reduction of temperature, gradually affecting and contracting the copper wire, sufficed to separate the broken ends, and thus prevent entirely the passage of electrical currents.' 1 Mr. F. C. Webb, the senior of Sir C. Bright s engineer ing staff, proceeded with Mr. Laws, in charge of the elec trical tests, to the spot where the latter had ascertained by observations that the conductor had parted, and effected a repair of the defect with a rapidity and certainty which Colonel Stewart justly considered ' a most conclusive proof of the thorough efficiency with which the duties of the officers, responsible for different j,,' L !7 t :^-. 0 1 l0nel Patrick St * wart t0 Secretary to Government, Bombay,180 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. parts of the work, had been performed/' He added, ' The position of the fault was calculated and laid down with a nicety which has never been surpassed. The course of the cable was so accurately defined by the surveying officers, and the vessels sent on the repairing trip so skilfully navigated, that the buoy intended to show the presumed position of the fault was actually laid down by the Zenobia within less than a quarter of a mile of its true position. &lt;c Rut for the occurrence of this accidental defect, no practical demonstration of the unceasing care with which every part of the work was performed by the officers I refer to would have been atiorded j and it is with tlie greatest pleasure that I now invite the special attention of Government to the only occurrence during the whole of the operations, that might at first sight have suggested doubts as to the permanency or efficiency of the Sub marine line.' In the clear and concise narration submitted for Colonel Stewart's information, and which accompanied his first quoted report to Government, Mr. Webb re marks that the rapidity with which the repairs were executed was due to the accuracy of the tests taken by Mr. Laws, the manner in which the position of the cable had been laid down by Captain Bradshaw and Mr. Young, the accuracy of the position taken up by Captain Stiffe (as also other assistance rendered by that officer), and the hard work and zeal of the foremen and men employed under exceptionally trying circumstances. He might further have attributed much of the result to his own skill and management, without departure from the strictest veracity. It now remains only to be stated that the section ofinal sea link. 181 cable between &lt;'wadar and Karachi, alternative to the land line connecting these stations, was successfully laid by Mr. Webb and his able assistants out of the and Cospcdrick, aided by the steamers Zenobia, Amber- witch, and .SW, between the 28th April and 16th May of this same year 1864. • ^ J lixoah, persian gulf.

It behoves us to revert to a period more than two years antecedent to that marking the completion of the first cable communication between India and Turkey. Mention has been made in a previous chapter that Colonel Patu Stewart had arrived at Bushahr in progress to the I ersian capital, when he reported on the respective merits ol a laud and sea line of telegraph, to connect our Eastern Empire with the more western States ot Asia. After stay of six days in that ungenial port, he started or his inland journey on the 6th April, accompanied b) his assistant, Lieut.

The question to be solved on commencement of opera tions was, how to connect Bushahr by telegraph with Shiraz, the first important town on the road to the capital? There wcie two routes, one by Kazarun to the west, of 1(35 mil os, and one by Firuzabad to the east, of 222 miles. Colonel Stewart considered the former 'beyond all doubt preferable.' It was more frequented and consequently more safe. The Firuzabad route was represented as better for the transport of artillery and for wheeled conveyances (of which none, however, were seen by the travellers from the coast up to Tehran), and might be so even for heavily-laden camels ; but the poor supply of water, timber, and forage, as well as the greater distance, were on the other hand valid objections. Colonel Stewart himself proceeded accordingly by Kazarun, arriving at Shiraz on the 18th April. 'Immediately on leaving Bushahr,' to quote Stewart's own ^ords. in describing this section of his route, 'a circuit is made to the S.E. to avoid the arm of the sea lying between the Bushahr promontory and the mainland. Here there is an ex ensive tract of salt marsh which continues about fifteen lies to the desolate village of Chahgodak.

It is very probable that the abundant produce ot these springs might be turned to most ■valuable account heie and elsewhere, in preparing timber and protecting it both from natural decay and the ravages of insects. Naphtha is uonn here else so plentiful as here, but it is found in many parts of the route about to be described, and is everywhere collected and used by the Persians, solely as an external remedy for sores or wounds on cattle and horses. From its position we were not surprised to hear that the heat at Daliki in the summer is almost unbearable. ' Shortly after leaving this place the road turns to the right through a narrow gorge in the hills, which are here composed prin cipally of sandstone and clay slate, and almost devoid of vegeta tion. After some mile or two of very steep and rocky ground, the Daliki, a rapid, brackish river, has to be crossed by a lord, 2 soon after which commences the first pass, the Kothal Malu. The i I had rather a painful experience of this fact when suftenng from a sudden sickness with which I was attacked after the first day's march from Bushahr. The heat at Barazjan, and some sixteen miles further beyond the village of Daliki, was indeed something to be remembered. ith reference to the latter occasion, I take an extract from my diary of June 1, 18/ : 'The sound of rushing waters among the rocks and ravines was pleasant; but oh, que dirai-je de la chaleur ? Under the half shadows ot that bridge we experienced the hot winds in very earnest, and I shall not soon forget t ie experience. It was much that of Shikarpur and Sakar, and of the hot parts of India, but without the relief of mess-rooms or the full benefit of mess- servants and mess-stores. Our cots were pitched for a great part ot the tune in the water itself. My head was continually bound in freshly -wetted or soaked handkerchiefs ; and S. and L., younger men, and perhaps m better health, actually lay down in the stream with their clothes on, letting them dry afterwards in the heated atmosphere. . . This is certainly not e country to travel through in hot weather. The thermometer was at Ui m our encamping place.' . ■ ,071 2 The new bridge called « Pul i Mushir' was under completion m Mn.

On reaching the top of the pass the fertile and well-cultivated plain of Khisht opens out. It boasts of several villages and plantations of date-trees. For about six miles the road lies across this plain, then for a mile or two over broken ground to the left bank of the Khisht river, which it follows closely for a short distance, and then turns abruptly to the right, to the loot of the second pass, or Kothal Kamarij. The path ascends I his by a series of short, abrupt zigzags, and on the face of the otherwise inaccessible mountain with a deep and dangerous ravine on the right. These hills are almost all of limestone, and their formation is most extraordinary. In many cases the strata are nearly vertical, and the outlines excessively grand and sublime. This pass, though not so long as the first perhaps more dangerous, notwithstanding the slight attempts which have been made to smooth the track, and the small parapets which have been built here and there on the brink of the precipices. From the summit of this pass a slight descent fcads into the plain of Kamarij, which is about six miles in length by three in breadth, and extends nearly north-west and v:nth-east. It is beautifully green and level, and well supplied iJt 1 water ' a,1(1 is surrounded by mountains. Date-groves are * no longer seen, and timber is very scarce.

From Kazarun, the road continues for about seven miles along the plain. i ^ leu crosses by a causeway over the marshy eatnary of a stream flowing into a brackish lake, turns to the left,' and approaches iho foot of the third pass, or ' Kothal Dukhtar.' This pass, hou.h not extensive, is very steep, and zigzags abruptly up the face of a mountain, about 800 feet high. Some trouble has been taken, however, to prevent accidents to travellers by smoothing the road itself to a certain extent and by building parapet w al s. Soon after reaching the top. the road descends into the beautiful valley of Abdui. which is covered with Persian oaks of modem e * ^ ' size. Another pass of consi.lfrable height now presents itself ■ it is called that of the ' Pir Zan,' or Old Woman, in contradistinction probably to the one immed .ately preceding, for ' Dukhtar' means maiden or virgin.

After leaving the plain there is another slight ascent and a series of windings amongst low hills to the bed of a stream flowing towards Shiraz, This stream must occasionally be formidable, but was easily forded at the time we saw it. The country is quite open from this to the caravanserai at Khan-i- Zanian, situated on a tributary to the above-mentioned stream, and about thirty miles from Shiraz. The road onwards has a slight gradual descent through the undulating and open country, and finally leads into a small valley which opens out into the plain of Shiraz, about eight miles from that city.' Descending from the high mountainous country to the plain of Dastarjin, the stranger will be struck with the numbeis of dwarf oak-trees observable on either side. These, though somewhat sparse to be considered forest, are yet sufficiently compact to give shelter to wild beasts' and the lion is no unfrequent attendant upon the passing traveller. In the spring of 18G7 one of the officers of Royal Engineers 2 connected with the Persian telegraph narrowly escaped serious injury from the onslaught of this formidable foe. He was riding in the neighbour hood in question slightly oft the beaten track, with no protective weapons but a pocket-pistol, and unprepared Iw aggressive man or beast, when he observed something- like a lion in front of him. The intruder showed incli^ nation to come to close quarters, and, as each drew nearer to each, kept his attention upon the horse, hovering about the startled animal, and finally assaulting him rom behind.

But the lion preferred a quadruped to a man in conflict; and renewed his attack upon the horse by a second spring, using his claws with effect to maintain his position. Away went horse and lion too, and hack- went the officer to a village in the Dastarjin plain, in which direction the assailant and assailed had dis appeared from sight. Night ensued ; the villagers could not be persuaded to light their torches and go in quest of the lion ; but his coveted prey was descried the next morning at large in the plain, and reco^icd, though sorely disabled. In 1871 I was riding along this parti cular road, and the scene of this adventure was pointed out to me; also a tree from which a Persian Ghulam had shot a lion. Many of the tombstones at the village of Dastarjin bear rude and eccentric sculptures of the king of beasts. Colonel Stewart, considering the feasibility of erecting a line of telegraph on the route traversed up to Shiraz, arrived at the conclusion that the passes presented no formidable barrier to the undertaking. Care and judg ment would be requisite in selecting the position of posts and supports, which should be accessible from the road amid winter snows as at ordinary seasons. But the line once constructed, with due forethought and precaution, he was of opinion there were 'few natural agencies to be dreaded as likely to interfere with its permanence.' Regarding materials for construction, he found the condi tions for masonry so favourable as to make him recom mend the occasional use of built supports ; but date-pok^ were readily procurable at a low price between Bushalu and Kazarun, and poplars could be brought from Shiraz to supply the deficiency of naturally grown timber el&amp;e-.v.] SHIRAZ TO BANDAR ABBAS. 189 where. The working season he regulated according to locality and nature of occupation : for the climate showed marked variations in this particular section, and actual construction needed allowances not applicable to meie comeyance and distribution of stores. He discussed the cost, capabilities, and available supply of mules, which, as the most approved beast of burden in those parts, appeared to represent the fittest means of transport for telegraph purposes. His calculation was that each mule would carry from 370 to 400 lbs., and make the journey fiom the coast to Shiraz in 12 days, but that the rate of payment would fluctuate between 9 and 22 rupees for 700 lbs, or nine shillings, and twenty-two shillings per mule. ^ Two months' notice,' he said, ' would suffice for the collection of from 5,000 to 8,000 mules, a number more than ample for all probable requirements. Camels and asses might be used, but are not so well suited as mules for so rocky and mountainous a road as this.' At Shiraz the travellers were busily engaged in makinrr inquiries about the routes between that city and the sea: and the direct route to Bandar Abbas was one which more particularly demanded their attention. 1 It is in fact 1 The supposed best route for the telegraph is recorded by Colonel Stewart as lollows:— . 9 Farsakhs^ Maharlu .

[chap. a question well worthy of close consideration whether any additional wire now supplied to existing commumcation, or even anv future third wire between Sluraz and Imshahr, would not be best provided for by a wholly new line from ghiraz to Bandar Abbas? Bushahr, having long been the usual port of traffic with the interior of Persia for British Indian vessels, has reaped the honours and advantages of a recognized line of communication, but tins state o things could never have originated in geograpmcal position or natural superiority ; it is one of those chance contingencies that take root in the East, irrespective of British interests and British advisers. As regards India, Bandar Abbas is, by sea, 4'25 miles nearer to Bombay than Bushahr, and the land distance from the former port to Shiraz is only 130 miles more than from the latter; and while it is 1,330 miles from Bombay to Shiraz rut Bandar Abbas, it is 1,625 vid Bushahr. 1 Colonel Stewart expressed himself well pleased with the attention of the British Agent, the Nawab AghaMuhammad Hasan Khan who rendered him valuable assistance in the collection ot essential data. .

Eiding up the steps to our left—for the mules move with wonderful precision where a horse would waver and possibly fall—we come first upon the remains of a huge gateway, exhibiting on either side the colossal figure of a bull. Passing through these we come upon two pillars, one on the right and one on the left, and find a corresponding gateway to the first, with large winged bulls, and a front to the hills. We return and take a course midway between the gateways and to the right of our original advance and find ourselves among many pillars in better or worse preservation, fluted, and of marble semblance, the remains, as it were, of a vast temple or palace, and raised on a base ornamented with bas-reliefs of skilful execution. Con tinuing our course in the same direction, we reach a more compact building, with doors and recesses ; and within the doorways and upon the walls are gigantic figures with beard and back hair, some plunging swords into lions or tigers, some marching in state with one or more attendants. Cuneiform writings abound, as also the more modern inscriptions of visiting travellers, among whom the irrepressible Briton takes the prominent place. Right and left are remains of other edifices. Retracing our steps for some little dis tance from the further end, or proper left of the plateau, we turn towards.the hill, and pass through what must have been a temple or court of vast dimen sions, judging from the space between the now-standing columns ; and next make a new ascent of the rock itself. Here we find a high scarp buried between two huge projecting scarps, and ornamented by fine gigantic bas- reliefs, the upper one representing, it would seem, a priest, bow in one hand, reaching towards an altar whence issue flames of fire. Above his head, and between him and the fire, is a device like a cross, placed horizontally. ' June 18.—Some three or four miles west of Persepolis, or the ' Takht-i- Jamshid,' as called by all Persians, are situated the rock caves bearing the esignation of ' Nakhshah-i-Rustam.' Between the two runs the post-road, and a little way on, to the left of the traveller pursuing that road upward towards Ispahan, is a high rock with remarkable scar]). He should halt here efore entering the pass, and go a little out of his way west, to see the caves, as he may probably have deviated east to see the temple remains. We visited Nakhshah-i-Rustam from the village of Shamsabad, whither we moved yesterday evening in pursuance of a kind invitation from the 4 Malik-i- •'jjar,' or Head of the Merchants, an intelligent Shirazi, who placed a houseTELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. ' From this place there are two roads for caravans towards Ispahan, separating, not far from the ancient ruins, at a point some thirty miles from Shiraz, and meeting again at \ ezdikhast, some eighty-four miles short of Ispahan. The more direct of these is the one invariably used by travellers and caravans, except for three months of winter, during which it is generally impassable by snow. The distance from Shiraz to Ispahan hy this route is 260 miles. 1 The other road, which lies more to the eastward, and passes through the town oi Murghab, is through out on a lower level, and can be kept open when the other road is impracticable. It is consequently exclusively used during the winter months, though the distance by it is somewhat greater. The first is known as the ' Sarhad,' or cold route ; the second as the ' Garmsir,' or warm route.' The travellers proceeded by the former, but Colonel Stewart eventually decided that the telegraph line should at our disposal. It is much the same distance from Shamsahad to the Nakhshah-i Rustam as from Kinarah to Takht-i-Jamshid ; and Shiimsaba is perhaps three miles nearer our stage of to-morrow than Kinarah. e skirted the Iliat village of Zangiabad, and approached, through cultivation, the rock to be visited.

It is the road of the Government 'Chapar,' or post, and free from the dangers of inter ruption to which the higher one is liable in the winter season : ' Turning then to the westward from Persepolis, wo passed along the left bank of the I'andamir for about twenty-five miles. Our route then entered a valley in the hills which had hitherto bounded the plain on the right, and, following the valley almost to its source, past the villages Maiyin and Imamzadah Ismail, led us to a very steep and strong pass, from the summit of which wg again descended (but in a less degree) to the dreary plains of Ujain, The nature of this pass and of the cliffs that over hang it is certainly such that heavy snow might at any time make it impassable, unless artificially kept open ; and it is quite possible that in such a pass all precautions might be rendered futile by a single avalanche at the very time of year when repairs must be most tedious and difficult of execution. On the plain of Ujain, and in all the level tracts of high land on the Sarhad route, snow of three or four feet in depth often lies for two months or more, but it is perhaps only in the pass just spoken of that any very serious difficulties would be experienced. The valley of Ujain itself is probably fifty miles in length by six to ten in width, and, like all the larger valleys in this part of the country, has a general north-westerly direction. Traversing this plain obliquely, the road crosses a low pass in the next range, by an easy ascent from the village of Asapas. It then skirts the north-eastern base of part of the same range, as far as the rifled caravanserai of K^ushW-^ard, passing along the edge of another extensive plain. This has a somewhat higher level than the plain of Ujain, but is equally destitute of timber, and more so of cultivation. Abundant pasture is, however, found ; and the valley, when we passed (May 4th), was tenanted by a rge number of Iliats, who had probably not less than sixty nips in the neighbourhood.

The Sarhad route lias no doubt groat advantages for travellers in the warm weather. Even in June the climate on the higher levels is deliglitfu ; an !i e 'o-hulams' from Shiraz, and letters to the chief authontie of the wandering tribes whose tents may be pitched on or near the line of route, should ensure, combined with ordinary precautions, safe travelling and hospitable treatment. And there are charming spots to be visite without straying from the direct way. Maiyin, witli its long row of trees and gardens, is at the commence ment of the narrow road foreshowing the ascent o high table-lands: except at the south, it is almost shu inby mountains. Twelve miles beyond, over a stony roa risinf in its second half, is Imamzadah Ismail, conspicuous from the shrine which gives its name to the few l)l&gt;e3 there ; a tall building, shaped much as the typical pear, or design of the poplar in Persian paintings and em ro deries. From this point the pass commences in earnes , and the direct ascent is a tolerably steep one o a six miles in length.

The new plains next reached are part of the high table-land of the Sarhad districts ; and the fine pure air and green meadows have an invigorating effect on the spirits, after a depressing experience of a Persian summer on the low lands. Here, with a thermometer rising little above 80°, and on an elevation of 7,500 feet, 1 a tent is enjoyable enough in June and if to such accommodation the hospitality of the Ilkhanf, the pnnce of the wandering tribes, or of his Ilbegi, or vice gerent, be added, the stranger, whoever he be, will have no reason to complain. Hence to Asapas the road is, with few exceptions, good, over the Ujain plains; and there are many villages, or clusters of huts, whence in some cases rises the large mud square fort, the most con spicuous of surrounding objects. As regards a day's en campment it is better to suffer the slight inconveniences of insufficient shade and persecuting flies under the Asapas willows near the strong and running stream, than to have recourse to an uncertain interior. 2 The road now leads 1 The air was so cold on the night of the 23rd of June, when the tent had een abandoned at Riza Abad, that I actually turned in, clothes and all, nder two coverlets, a red blanket and Scotch plaid ! rpf. , e 0 r f C ' ers 0 ^ the Sistan Mission were at Asapas in June 1871, on their return to rehran from Makran, and had made their bivouac below the trees, here mentioned - Facing them was a line of rocky commptif, 0 ?

It is not unlike a section, or three upper stories of houses in the old town of Edin burgh, only the windows are scarcely so regular and substantial. Below the cliff, and in the bed, as it were, of a ravine, are a post-house and a caravanserai. From Ujain to Sao, a postal station north of Ispahan, Colonel Stewart prepared a road survey. He had found the information on the country traversed so inaccurately recorded, that the measure was deemed likely to he one of future utility. To resume his report ' From Yezdikhast onwards the country requires no minute description. As far as Kuraishah (fifty miles from Ispahan , the road passes through a broad stony valley bounded by deso late, rocky, limestone hills. At first utterly barren, the country improves towards Kumishah, where, as well as at several villages near it, there are a considerable number of gardens and enclosures from which there would be no difficulty in procuring a certain mitted upon them and attended with loss of life.

At the former is a shrine of great sanctity, much resorted to by pilgrims, who visit it in large bodies. It is therefore possible that, in the event of the tele graphic line being constructed along this route, and separate wires being allotted to local and through traffic, intermediate offices in connection with the former might be established with advantage at each of the places referred to. 1 From Kiim to KinarahGird,twenty-five miles short of Tehran, the track lies alternately over dreary strips of the salt desert and sandy ravines. 1 he heat for part of the year is intense, and drinking-water not procurable, except where (as at Hauz-i-Sultan) it is stored in tanks for use. A more miserable and deserted tract of country can hardly be conceived than the seventy miles here alluded to. 2 'At Kinarah Gird there are a few villages and fields : after which another low ridge of naked hills is passed, and Tehran itself appears in sight at a distance of about fifteen miles.' Colonel Stewart concluded his report by discussing the various details suggested by the object of his journey. Kuiu is a place of great note in Persia, from possessing the shrine of the mnc regarded iatima; and to be buried there is a privilege still in hicdi estimation, as may be certified by the numerous coffins borne into its precincts rom without. It is a long, straggling, semi-ruined town, liberally endowed *1 h sepulchral monuments surmounted by quasi-minarets certainly deficient in architectural beauty.

[chap. Physically considered, the nature of the country seemed to offer extraordinary facilities for telegraphic commu nication. Timber was more or less artificially produced, but was nevertheless procurable in sufficient quantity. There was no obstacle to be apprehended in rivers. Ihere mioht be danger to the line in some places from falling x ocks, especially owing to the prevalence of earthquakes: but discretion would be used in selecting positions fur supports, and the probability of accidents would thus be reduced to a minimum. As regards climate, ' a point of no small importance where Luropeans are conceined, he wrote— ' The whole of the route may be said to have immense advan tages as compared with any part of India. From the Kothal Dukhtar to Tehran . . . probably no part of the whole route is at a lower level than 3,200 feet; and though the elevation is not sutti- cient to prevent the heat of July and August from becoming exces sive in the more barren and desert positions, the heat even there is of short duration; and every where tracts of sufficient elevation to give a delightful cool climate are of comparatively easy access. In travelling from Bushahr to Tehran between the 6tli April and 20th May, we never experienced any inconvenience worth speaking of, from heat, although we never travelled by night, and were frequently exposed to the sun the whole day long. At the numerous places where no other cleanly accommodation was procurable we used a small, single-roofed tent of the lightest and thinnest description, and very rarely felt the want o an) better protection from the sun. Had our travellers been two months later, they would, perhaps, have felt some inconvenience from the hot winds and hot atmosphere of the low marshy country near Bushahr, as well as the more inland plains, until the actual rise to the high table-lands. But there is, 1K doubt, very much to be said on behalf of the Persia 11iv.] COST OF CONSTRUCTION. 201 climate oi the liiglilands, and inauy EuroiJean residents or travelleis will readily endorse the favourable opinion here generally expressed. The questions of construction, and employment of natives under European superintendence were next adverted to. A. separate sketcli-estimate of cost was forwarded : and as the line might perhaps be treated in the first instance as purely experimental, this would be, with proper management, extremely small. Judging, however, fiom the practical results of an existing line between Tabriz and the capital, and other data, Stewart thought that a much larger expenditure might be after wards found warrantable. The estimate, as first prepared, made the cost per mile £42 10s. or within £50,000 for a complete telegraph line from the Turkish frontier to Tehran, thence to Shiraz, and thence passing to the sea both at Bushahr and Bandar Abbas, roughly 1,407 miles. Ibis estimate contemplated two wires, each of No. 5, B. W. G. best galvanized; the strongest pattern of Siemens patent cast-iron and porcelain insulators; and the common poplar poles of the country. Colonel Stewart need not now be followed into his figures, w ethei for receipts of line or disbursements on account maintenance and working. Circumstances have so completely changed within the last few years, both in respect of extraneous competition and our own relations with the Persian authorities, that all interest in such cu ations must be obsolete.

Colonel Stewart reports well of the treatment per sonally experienced on his journey from the natives of the country :— 'From Bushahr to Tehran we did not meet with anything approaching to incivility, nor did we or our servants lose a single article either on the march or during halts. It is true that a decided disinclination to meddle with European travellers, and a wholesome dislike of rifles and revolvers, might to a certain extent account for this) but it in no way explains the fact that we also utterly failed in all our attempts to ascertain the details or locality of any recent robbery or act of violence. On the con trary, if an allowance be made for the anxiety of muleteers to exaggerate risks, with a view to enhancing the value of their own services, and of the heads of villages to secure the trifling advantage ot being allowed to provide an escort of Tufangchis (matchlock-men), and to profit by their gains, the result of our inquiries invariably went to prove that the whole route was surprisingly secure, and that on the rare occasions when violence ma y possibly be attempted, the sole object must be that of plundering, Irom selfish motives, some small and entirely unpro tected party, and not in any way that of causing wanton annoy ance to the Government or its agents. Even in the case of our own personal effects ample oppor tunity for unresisted robbery was allowed. Our order of march ^as invariably as follows: The heavy baggage and servants, with some twelve or fourteen mules, led the way, making each march during the night. In the mountain tracts between Bushahr and Shiraz we were at first prevailed on to pay for a small guard of five to six ragged matchlock-men, whose arms were probably dangerous to none but their owners, but who as a matter of form accompanied this baggage detachment. This was entirely given up on our departure from Shiraz, when the Prophet, were concerned in the participation of the stolen goods. But when ie authorities punish such offences with promptitude and vigour, letting it e thoroughly understood they are in earnest, the temptations to pilfer are so combined with fear of chastisement and humiliation, that they lose their power, and soon cease to exist.

We ourselves, retaining only our bedding and personal necessaries, always halted till daybreak, and then made the march entirely without auards. leavincr the main road for very considerable distances o 7 C whenever our doing so promised to reward us by a better view of the country from some neighbouring range, and taking every opportunity of visiting any villages or encampments of black tents we might approach. On all such occasions we were in variably treated with the greatest hospitality ; any little delicacies the people might possess being at once placed at our disposal. Two mules with our bedding and appurtenances brought up the rear, and these were always unprotected and never accompanied us on the march, ' Of course, when Europeans or natives of importance are concerned, there must be some truth in what we were occa sionally told ; namely, that any loss sustained by them is certain to be represented and to attract attention, and that all interfer ence with the property of such persons is to be avoided for this reason as well as from dread of resistance; but whatever weight this may have, the same considerations would apply still more forcibly in the case of wanton injury to a line of telegraph, the occurrence of which must instantly become known at the nearest station, and thus facilitate measures of detection or retribution, while the materials of the line can, as before explained, offer in themselves little or no temptation. ' It is now nearly two years since the occurrence of almost the only authenticated case we could hear of on this route of interference with any individual ever so indirectly connected with the Government. In this case a mounted Ghulam, taking amongst other property English letters and papers towards Bushahr, was, after leaving Shiraz, robbed not far from Khau-i- Zanian. This neighbourhood lias the credit of being more insecure than any other on the whole route, or in other words, the authority of the Government is supposed to be less here than elsewhere. However, an order was sent from Shiraz threatening all persons in whose possession any of the missing property might be found, and before long the whole was (juietly depositediv.] REASONING ON THE HKJilWAY. 205 in a public mosque in that city, and then recovered. From the plains of Bushahr to the highland midway between Shiraz and Ispahan, the whole ol the country traversed is at one season or another of the year occupied almost exclusively by tribes of Hiats, who migrate north and south in search of pasture for their Hocks in the spring and autumn respectively, and who move during these migrations by slow marches along the regular road. It may be well worth consideration whether the undoubted in fluence and control exercised over these tribes by their chief (the llkham, icsident in Shiraz) might not be used by the Government with advantage, in securing the goodwill of these people and possibly in enlisting some of them permanently as guards.' We have now completed our extracts; but befV^e taking leave of the Report, a word may be said on the quotations last recorded. Tliey are given in extenso, because relating to a state of things interesting at the present day, when Persia has suddenly, as it were, made a debut on the European diplomatic stage, and been brought into the share-market as a field for investment. There is much truth, and sense, and keen foresight in the sketch of the country here attempted, or supposed : but the colour of the picture is perhaps a little too roseate. Hospitality and fair treatment of strangers are common to a degree ; a statement verified by Europeans in Persia Pioper, and in the north, south, east, west, and centre of the kingdom. But life and property, however secure, must not be thought wholly dependent on the adven titious fact of particular nationality or status. The advantages of being a European, or a person of distinc tion, may in this respect be over-rated. A highwayman, from the dashing Bakhtiari to the mere footpad, is not invariably more scrupulous in Asia than in Europe, M ' K ' n m the way of professional temptation; nor is ho2 06 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

Since the wires were set up in 1864-5, instances might be given of aggravated assault on the open road, attended in some cases with fatal results, on British officers holding both high and responsible posts in the Telegraph Department, as well as on their fellow-labourers of inferior rank : nor have robberies in camp or quarters been by any means unknown among the English employes generally. It is but fair to the Persian Government to say that such occurrences are at least the cause of distress to the ministers chiefly responsible ; and that if they have not in allcases shown by their acts a full determination to make severe examples of offenders, they have roused them selves now and then to vigorous action in some sense, as might reasonably be expected. It is just also to make allowances for something exceptional in the mere fact of Englishmen moving continually to and fro in parts of Persia where marauding is a normal condition; and the passage of a European at all was, ten } cars ago, a novelty. Still, the truth remains, that even those who now traverse the country with a sense of comparative security, and take few special precautions for personal safety or protection of baggage, cannot deny the exist ence of seasons and circumstances when, or of localities where, molestation on the highway would be no impro bable contingency. Colonel Stewart reached Tehran on the 20th May, preceding his assistant Lieutenant Champain by two days, owing to the use of post-horses after leading Ispahan.

Submitting his report of journey through the interior of the country, working with his staff at ' conditions for a Telegraph ireaty, and endeavouring by diplomatic or other legitimate agency to set the business ball going, he found his own estimate of time to be Cjuite different from that of Persian officials. Progress, if such it could be called, was slow and unpromising. Stewart's health soon failed him, and he left Tehran for England, md Resht and the Caspian, on the 19th June, just one month after arrival. Lieutenant Champain remained in Persia, but his duties were not at this time very defined. To render general service at the Mission, and acquire personal knowledge and experience of a country known generally to the educated world by books, would best, perhaps, describe the nature of his employment. On the 12th October he quitted the capital for Hamadan and Karmanshah, thence crossing the frontier and con tinuing his journey to Baghdad, where he arrived on the 8th November. Were it not that our subject recalls us to the Persian negotiations, we might here add a summary of his valuable Route-Report on this occasion. We must again go back for a year or two before narrating subsequent proceedings at Tehran.

Bandar Abbas, to form a component part of a longer line from England to India ; and on the iTtb May Sir Charles Wood forwarded a memorandum to Mirza Jiafar Khan, the Persian ambassador in London, offering as general terms of agreement. ^ 1st. That the line should commence at Baghdad, proceed thence to Tehran, and from that city vid Ispahan and Shiraz, to Bandar Abbas. 2nd. That the expense of the construction should be shared equally by the two countries. 3rd. That the line should be executed under the super intendence of British officers, to be selected by the Secretary of State for India. 4th. That it should consist of two wires, one for the exclusive use of the Persian, and one of the British Government. The next three provisions were ; for dividing expenses of working and maintenance, repayment to each Govern ment being regulated by the value of the messages sent by them respectively under certain prescribed rates of tariff: for repayment of sums advanced by the British Government for construction, out of value of messages sent by them, above portion required for share of working and maintenance ; and for repayment of sums last name by Government of Persia under other conditions, if siich a course should be rendered necessary by acts of Persian subjects. The Mirza's reply was to the effect that a tele graph line like that contemplated was not actua y essential to the Persian Government ; but that the Sha i might be induced to consider the question in the hope o securing the friendship and good feeling of the Engis^ Government. He thought that sanction might be obtained for constructing a line from Baghdad tow an siv.] NEGOTIATIONS WITH PERSIA. 209 Karachi through Persia, by granting to his Government the privilege of transmitting a certain number of words daily, free of expense, and transferring to them, after a specified term of years, the whole line and its revenues. Or the proposal might be made to construct a line from the Baghdad frontier to Bandar Abbas, at the joint ex pense of the two Governments; the arrangement being- qualified by a handsome bonus from the British Govern ment, such as a gratuitous supply of wire or money independently of any debtor and creditor accounts. Sir Charles Wood acknowledged this letter by a counter- proposition. If the Shah preferred that the line contem plated should be altogether constructed and worked by British officers, her Majesty's Government would not object, on condition that it should remain in the hands of the Indian Government for a period of years, say twenty- five ; all expenses being paid and all receipts retained by the latter. After that period it should be transferred wholly to Persia, on her undertaking to keep it in perfect working order, and to convey the messages of tie British and Indian Governments at a rate mutuallv agreeable. J This correspondence having been communicated to the oreign^ Office, was passed on for the information of her lajesty's Minister at Tehran, with a hint that, as Mirza jhafar Khan was on his way back to Persia, his arrival e waited before coming to any decision on the pro posals. 1 On the 4th September her Majesty's Minister wrote rem teliran, enclosing copy of a letter he had received rom the ex-ambassador, who had arrived at Tabriz. In ictrue spifh of Persian diplomacy the latter excused e oi unlooked-for and compulsory delay, when heTELEGliAPH AND TRAVEL. had pledged himself to Sir Charles Wood to return as soon as possible; and suggested that Mr. Alison, w ithout waiting his uncertain arrival, should at once open discussion of the telegraph question with Mirza Saiyid Khan, the Minister for Foreign Affairs ; though this high official was prepared to notify the Shah's objection to Mirza Jiafar's own proposal made in England. Mr. Alison naturally asked that a gentleman conver sant with the subject of telegraphic communication in all its details be attached to the mission for the impend ing negotiations; but before Colonel Patrick Stewarts appearance on the scene in compliance with this request, an important but disappointing phase in the question bad supervened. On the 6th November, 1861, a memorandum was put into Mr. Alison's hands from the Persian Foreign Minister, containing eleven Articles of an Agreement which the Shah was ready to subscribe to without delay. The first six, it was stated, had already been put forward, and it is presumed in England. I. Expenses of construction were to be wholly defrayed by England. II. The British Government would work the line and take the profits for tw.enty-five years. III. Certain messages, under certain limitations, were to be sent free of charge for the Persian Government. IV. Materials procurable in Persia were to be sold at the rate of the day. V. The Persian Government w T ould protect the line to the best of its power. VL The Persian Government would pay expenses incurred by English Government, if the lineiv.J ARTICLES OF PROPOSED AGREEMENT. 211 were stopped by contingencies of war, at the instance of a foreign power. VII. Expenses of protecting the line would be paid by British Government. VIII. The British Government would engage that aa hatever power and authority and proprietary right the Persian Government, from former times to the present day, possessed, from near Bandar Abbas to the Sind frontier, remain in statu quo. IX. Also that if Persia desired to increase its power in those territories, the British Government would in no way oppose such action. X. Also that if Persia should be in a condition to pro tect the line in those territories, such expense of protection would be defrayed by the British Government. XI. If the Persian Government thought fit to re imburse the British for the expenses of the line from Khanikin throughout, then, on certain conditions, it would come into its full posses sion. In less than a fortnight after communicating this pro posal to the Foreign Office, Mr. Alison made a further leport on the subject. Pie had received a visit from arukh Khan, the envoy who had negotiated the Peace reaty in Paris, and this nobleman was most urgent in enlisting the British Minister's support for the new Draft Articles. I he Foreign Minister, moreover, sent a message to His Excellency with evidently a like intent. On the 18th February, 1862, Earl Kussell informed /• Alison that her Majesty's Government saw no 0 ejection to the letter of the sixth Article, admitting an ' O P 2212 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. 1 undoubted liability ; but could not suppose that Persia would act in so unfriendly a manner as stated in the hypothesis. Article \ II. could not be accepted : but her Majesty's Government would undertake payment of half expenses of protection on certain conditions. AVith regard to the three next articles, her Majesty's Govern ment would agree that no territorial claims of Persia should be affected by any arrangement made on account of the telegraph ; but they declined to enter into any prospective engagements as to the protection of the line through the tracts indicated. There was no difficulty in the way of accepting the last article. To those accus tomed to the routine between the two Government Offices concerned, it need hardly be explained that the Foreign Office letter to Mr. Alison was almost a verbatim • &gt; i copy of that addressed to it by the India Office. Hint no allusion was made to the first five articles of the Persian Memorandum, was perhaps tantamount to a tacit admission that they had been, as inferred, originally agreed to in England, and needed only the Shahs approval. Indeed the ' new articles ' are said to com mence from that numbered VI. in the paper. 1 It would really seem that there were not only no in superable obstacles now in the way of a satisfactory conclusion, but that the question had resolved itself into a diplomatic nutshell. Persian politics, however, are clouded and tangled ; and the lapse of time does not always serve to clear or unravel them. Mr. Alisons reply to Earl Russell, dated 25th April, pointing out that the Shah refused to consent to any alteration of his con ditions, made no allusion whatever to renewal of ' In correction, apparently, of the Persian statement which would roa'f it VII.IV.] COLONEL STEWART IN ENGLAND. 21:} discussion, and wound up with the following curt para graph ' The subject of the telegraph may be considered to be completely disposed of for the present.' At this time Colonel Stewart and Lieutenant Champain had passed Shiraz on their way to Tehran ; and it cannot be said that a cheeiful political aspect would greet them on arrival at the latter city. 1 Throughout the whole of the summer months there seems to have been utter stagnation in the diplomatic 'correspondence respecting the construction of a telegraph line through Persia,' and, from the date of its resumption, 2 it may bo inferred that the first batch of renewed com munications on the subject only reached Tehran after Lieutenant Champain's departure. Indeed renewal at all was caused by receipt of Colonel Stewart's report sent home by Mr. Alison. The Foreign Office wished to be informed what were the views of the Secretary of State for India on the subject ? ^ But Colonel Stewart himself had ere this returned to England, and was in active communication with the autho rities. His letter of the 24th August, inclosing copies of much that he had writen when absent, submitted a sum mary of his own opinions on the course to be pursued in furtherance of the telegraph project, ' as affected by the p Ure „ 0f the recent ne g 0 tiations with the Court of t'isia.

Hence the reply to Earl Pvussell's question represented that 'it would be very desirable to have a second line from Baghdad through Persia, to a suitable place on the coast, where it might be joined to the line through the Persian Gulf; ' and Earl Russell transmitted a copy to Mr. Alison with instructions ' to re-open negotiations with the Persian Government, with the view ol carrying out the wishes of her Majesty's Government, as set forth in the India Office letter.' In a month or so, this des patch was followed by a second, intimating the detei- mination of effecting ' telegraphic communication with India, in the first instance, by means of a cable to he laid down the Persian Gulf,' and the intention of estab lishing ' a station at Bushahr, and also, if necessary, at or near Bandar Abbas.' The necessary permission was to be obtained from the Persian Government. 1 Mr. Alison's despatch of the 4th November reported having recommended the subject of the telegraph from Baghdad to Tehran and the Persian Gulf to the Shahs favourable consideration, and having directed Mr. Thom son to communicate more fully on the ' matter with the Persian Ministers.' His Excellency took the opportunity of acquainting Earl Russell that the Shah was actually arranging for a line of telegraph to meet a Turkish lint at the frontier near Baghdad, the cost to be defrays out of the Government treasury,' and that a company 1 Nos. 22 and 24, page 12, Printed Correspondence.PERSIA AND THE PORTE. 215 was ' being formetl to lay down a telegraphic wire from the capital to Shiraz. Of the composition or nationality of this company not a word was said. It must be always borne in mind, was the characteristic conclusion of the despatch, ' that telegraphic lines in Persia are always getting out of order.' 1 Mr. Alison left for England on or about the date of this report. There was a show of vacillation in the negotiations between Persia and the Porte; but it is impossible to determine what were the plain facts of the case. Several months had passed since the subject had been first mooted by the two Governments, and in January 1862, the Shah had expressed to the Ottoman Minister the great desire that he felt for the establishment of tele graphic communication between Tehran and Baghdad. On the 30th May, a few days after Colonel Stewart's arrival in the capital, Mr. Alison further reported to Earl Russell the abrupt termination of this affair also. The Turkish ^Minister had informed him that 'having received full powers from the Porte to conclude a convention for the establishment of the telegraphic line between Baghdad and lehran, in pursuance of a strong desire expressed on the part of the king, ... .he lost no time in com municating with the Persian Government on the subject. Haidar Efendi,' Mr. Alison added, ' was not a little surprised at being informed, in reply, that the king had changed his mind, and now meditated establishing a telegraphic line between Resht and Tehran. I learn that it is the intention of the Russian Government to complete this telegraphic line to Tiflis, and to extend it, if possible, to Tabriz.' 2 1 No. 25, page 13, Printed Correspondence.

[cha Mr. Eastwick became Charge d'Affaires on Mr. Alison's departure; but as he was absent on duty at Mashhad at the period of his accession, the conduct of the telegraphic discussion remained for a time in Mr. Thomson's hands. On the 3rd December this gentleman reported that he had had frequent interviews with the 1 ersian Ministers, in the cause of the projected telegraph. In illustration of the general result, it will suffice for our purpose to state that the Shah expressed his determination to con struct, at his own expense, a line of telegraph from Khanikin on the Baghdad frontier to Bushahr, through Tehran, Ispahan and Shiraz, intended to be m connec tion with the proposed telegraph to India through the Persian Gulf. 1 On the 9th December, Mr. Eastwick returned to Tehran, and ten days afterwards forwarded to the Foreign Office the draft of a convention, acceptance of which the India Office considered should at once be notified by telegram to Her Majesty's Charge d Affaires in Persia This agreement was of six short Articles, as follow :— I. Persia to construct a line of telegraph from Khanikin to Tehran and Bushahr, which the British Government might use on payment. II. Persia to assign the sum sufficient for construction and materials. III. Persia to purchase European materials fioni England at reasonable rates. IV. Line to be superintended by an English Engineer officer under certain local restrictions, and pai by his own Government, Persia fixing the period of his employment. 1 No. 26, page 13, Printed Correspondence. .AFIRST PRACTICAL UNDERSTA NDING. V. English superintendent empowered to make requi sitions for necessary materials, under specified conditions. VL British Government to convey to Persian frontier materials purchased from them, with approval of Persian Minister in London, payment being made by five instalments, in five years. 1 There is no doubt that, whatever imperfections and want of detail may be exhibited in this paper, viewed as a convention between two Governments on a question essentially practical and full of technicalities, its use as a preliminary to work is undeniable; and the ready and legitimate mode in which it was obtained may be cited as an example of how much may be done by determina tion, combined with ability. In the expression of such opinion it is not in the least intended to reflect on those who failed to secure for the telegraph in Persia the fair start which it required ; nor to compare the public acts of one high official with those of another. Everyone who knows the Oriental character in diplomacy knows how much depends on happy moments and happy occasions ; and if it be a merit to take advantage of these, as they pre sent themselves, it is also no demerit to live throuoh the o season when they never arise at all. Judgments should, at least, be suspended on those things until much of ^veiy description of evidence has been thoroughly weighed. Nor would the question be alluded to in this Volume at all, were it not the duty of the writer, in his position as an official chronicler, to acknowledge obliga tions of so marked a kind as those to the framer of the fi^t practical paper with Persia on the subject of a tele graph, he it designated an agreement, an engagement, or Jso. 27, page 15, Printed Correspondence.TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

The Anglo-Persian Telegraph would, no doubt, have had substance of some kind, whether given to it by one Minister or another, but it is to ]Mr. Eastwick that its existence, such as we have seen and experienced it, is, without question, mainly due. The subsequent communications were on details. Colonel Stewart submitted at once a programme for im mediate operations, which was accepted, and foiwarded through the usual channels to Persia. It was hebiuary when the telegram was despatched approving Mr. East- wick's convention : so that stores, wires and insulators could not reach Bushahr till August. But work was at once to be ' commenced by procuring and distributing strong timber posts along the whole line, which should everywhere follow the regular road.

If there were to be alternative hues between these two points, one through Asiatie Turkey and the sea cable, and one through Persia, which was te receive the bulk of the traffic? or was there to be no distinction ? The Secretary of State for India, who had been in personal communication with the Persian Minister in London on this rather knotty question, agreed to despatch one-fourth of the messages through Persia so long as there was but one wire in that country, and one-half of the messages when there were two wires to meet the traffiCr But to this arrangement Persia was indifferent, and Turkey demurred.

On the 13th August the India Office reported to the Foreign Office that the European staff and stores for the telegraph had been despatched ; and on the same date Earl Russell trans mitted to Mr. Alison a detailed memorandum on the sub ject from Colonel Stewart. This enclosure represented the distance between Khanikin and Bushahrto be 1,102 miles, but that materials had been provided for a single wire of 1,200 miles. As a rule there would be twenty-one ordinary and three stretching insulators per mile, but exceptions would be made where rendered advisable by the nature of the ground. The greater portion ot the stores would be landed at Bushahr lor transport on mules towards Tehran: a small proportion would be sent via Basrah and the Tigris to Baghdad. One vessel might be expected at Basrah early in October, another one about the middle or before the end of that month at Bushahr. Two gentlemen, Messrs. Man and W alton, leaving England with a line inspector on the 8th August, would give all necessary information and assistance until Lieutenant Champain's arrival. The latter officer would proceed to Bushahr, soon after reaching Tehran, to meet the vessels and stores.

On the 13th October, 1864, Major 1 Champain reported for the information of the Bombay Government, com pletion of the line of telegraph from Baghdad, through Tehran, to Bushahr. At the same time he entered fully into explanations why the work had not been accom plished at an earlier date. No reasons for delay would have been asked had the matter been simply considered in its moral or physical aspect: but a period for con struction had been specified, and in the true spirit of military exactitude, it was well to show why the estimated days had been exceeded. We will briefly review this officer's proceedings, as related in his official report. Of the five gentlemen appointed to serve as superintendents. Major Champain had found Messrs. Man and Walton already in Persia, on his return thither in October, 1863. The former he then despatched to Ispahan, to see to the necessary collection and distribution of poles : the latter he sent to Baghdad, with instructions to expedite the looked-for wire and insulators to the Turco-Persian frontier, and thence distribute it along the line to Tehran. One of his inspectors, Mr. Ernest Hoeltzer, he left at Tehran to instruct young Persians in the use of the Morse instru ment. He himself rode on to Bushahr, wdiere, finding that much material had arrived, he at once set about sending it along the line on mules supplied by the Governor of the town. Some three weeks passed in this occupation ; when, detailing two non-commissioned officers to continue the work until Lieutenant St. John, 1 This officer is henceforth designated by the local rank which was accorded to him in Persia.IV -] APPORTIONMENT OF WORK. 223 one of the Engineer officers awaited from India, should arrive, he again turned towards Tehran, but accompanied on this occasion by Captain Smith (who had recently returned from Basrah), one inspector, and four sergeants. After making arrangements at Shiraz for the despatch of stores expected from Bushahr to points further up the line; dropping two sergeants at Ispahan; ascertaining that some of the material had actually reached that city moreover, that Mr. Man had already set up there two or three miles of posts and insulators, he repaired to his head-quarters at the capital. Here he remained-a month, unsuccessfully endeavouring to obtain poles for his superintendent, so that work might be begun in the Tehran district. Then, thinking the locality the most likely to meet the exigencies of the occasion, he sent Captain Smith and his party to the city of Kum, a main station within his range of superintendence. The five divisions were apportioned as follows.

The Director, with the intention of reinspecting the whole course of the line, and ussisting cdch supcnoi ufiicci in overcoming the difficulties presenting themselves, soon quitted Tehran and moved towards Baghdad. Mr. Man's serious illness caused him some anxiety , and he had to employ the services of Captain Gastaiger, an Austrian officer of Engineers in the Shah's pay, temporarily to supply the want of a superintendent. Major Champain speaks well of the manner in which this dut^ was pei- formed. Captain Gastaiger, ' placing himself under Mr. Man's orders, assumed charge of the working party, which that officer was too ill to direct. The operations were then loeing carried on some sixty iiiiIls north of Ispahan with great difficulties and dt'la^s. Jjaboui and carriage for material were but scantily supplied by the Persians, and the intense cold at the time rendered the wire so brittle that it was almost impossible to join or strain it. Working for weeks together while the snow was lying waist-deep on the ground, and in the miserable villages scattered at long intervals from one another along the road. Captain Gastaiger and the two non-commis sioned officers, Corporals Macdonald and Norman, could make but slow progress; but they deserve great credit for their indomitable perseverance, and for the cheerful ness with which they bore the very serious hardships to which they were exposed.' On his way to Baghdad, 1 Major Champain found that Lieutenant Pierson and Mr. Walton, whose divisions touched, had joined at the town of Karmanshah.

Passing on to Baghdad, and proceeding thence by river to the anchorage of the sea steamer, Major Champain reached Bushahr again from the sea-side. 1 Here he met Lieutenant St. John° who had already, with his energetic assistants, completed seventy miles of inland telegraph, in addition to a short ten miles' •line in connection with the submarine cable. But rapid progress depended on extraneous aid, and this was not always procurable. 'The Governor of Bushahr,' we are told, ' had assisted Lieutenant St. John, but as soon as the line had passed through his territory into that of the Governor of Shiraz, the change was speedily felt. The labourers, no longer paid or fed, rapidly deserted : no representations to the Governor of Shiraz had any effect ; ' and when the Director came up with the working party, he found that it only numbered ten men out of Sixty at first engaged. At Shiraz he tried three times to see the Governor, but was always refused ad mittance ; and the Persian responsible telegraph official accounted for the failings on his own part by saying 10 could g et no money for mules, and was completely powerless.

The result, however, showed how little ground existed for such suppositions. One Governor, basking in the very light of the royal presence, would supply no poles; another, but little removed from such lustrous propinquity, would not permit the English officer to work within the limits of his jurisdiction. Forty miles of telegraph were set up in the division of which Tehran was the northern terminus; but Major Champain, on return to that city, the 19th May, saw that unless vigorous measures were at once adopted, his work would be fairly paralysed. His report may here be quoted, though it rather under-estimates than represents his real difficulties. 'After inexplicable delay the poles were gradually laid out about the end of August, and work proceeded. All this time the most stringent orders had been continually sent by the Persian Ministers and the Shah himself to the Governor of Tehran, who for three months would take no notice whatever of the firmans. An officer of the king's was quartered in the Governor's house to ensure obedience, but without effect Nothing would induce the Persian authorities at Tehran to give us either mules or men for the work. Two of my officers and their subordinates had been idle for weeks, when at last the poles were laid out, and I thought it advisable to expend the comparatively small sum that would be required for labour, and to complete the line at our own cost.' 1 It would be needless to dwell on the failure of trans port arrangements, so far as left to promise and per- 1 Major Champain to Secretary to Government, Bombay.

It was not simply that orders for money were dishonoured and disregarded: or that labour without wages was not procurable in Persia any more than in England. The miserable system of intervention acknowledged in the former country, by which the master does not deal directly with the menial nor the proprietor with the peasant, was at work, and the mediating agency, unless vivified by peculation without limit, was cold and lifeless. Sanction to pilfer is too much to solicit from honourable guardians of the public interests; for however bitter to many Englishmen the pill of conformity to national customs may have been on previous occasions, it could never have been made a universal state medicine if such had been a declared ingredient. Nothing that could in honour be accorded to the customs, or even prejudices of the country was to be withheld. Pride, temper, repugnance, all these sentiments were to be restrained to the utmost. But patience may lose her balance at times in the best- regulated minds ; and if she had done so during early telegraphic operations in Persia, there would have been no cause of amazement. As it was, Major Champain, on reporting completion of the first wire of communi cation, pronounced the conduct of the officers and men to have been 'admirable,' adding that it was 'to their intense perseverance and patience, notwithstanding the most harassing and vexatious treatment,' that he at tributed success, so far as it had been obtained, in the undertaking with which he had been entrusted. 1 1 Major Champain to Secretary to Government, Bombay.

Dr. Baker had rendered him valuable professional and general assistance, and Mr. Inspector Willis and Corporal Whittenback/, Royal Engineers, had ' exerted themselves unweariedly.' In the second division the 'untiring zeal and activity ' of Mr. Henry Valentine Walton were specially noticed ; and instances were cited in illustration of the assertion that 'notwithstanding disheartening difficulties, bad climate and ill health/' he had ' worked most cheer fully and ably on all occasions. ' Mr. Inspector Shanat and Corporal Graves, Eoyal Engineers, had led a trying life during nine months. ' Exposed at first to excessive cold and afterwards to intense heat, and en camped for many weeks at a time in deserts without water,' their behaviour throughout was highly com mended. The labours of Captain Murdoch Smith, Royal Engineers, who, in charge of the third division, bad been ' perhaps more annoyed by the Persians than any other superintendent,' had resulted in a ' beautifully laid out and finished line,' a reward of the ' most untiring patience and unconquerable determination.' Inspector Signor Barbara, Sergeant Bower and Corporal Barry, Royal Engineers, had been spoken of by Captain Smith in the warmest terms for services rendered.

Finally, Lieutenant St. John, in charge of the fifth division, whose late arrival in the country prevented him from breaking ground until the 15tli March, had not only finished his own division, but a part of the fourth also 'with remarkable rapidity.' In exactly five months that officer 'joined up his wire with Mr. Hoeltzer's, 335 miles from Bushahr, after carrying it over by far the most difficult passes, and through the only really wooded country that the line traverses.' He had displayed 'most wonderful energy and peculiar tact in dealing with the Persians,' and deserved the cordial thanks of his Director for Lis 'great activity and perseverance.' Mr. Inspector Daniel), Sergeant Isaacson, and Corporal Hamilton, Royal Engi neers, and the Nawab Hasan Ali Khan were at the same time spoken of in high terms for services rendered in this division. 1 But before dismissing the report, it will be well to glance at its enclosures, or the separate reports of the Superintendents themselves. 2 One of Captain Pierson's main difficulties had been of a purely political nature. The Turkish and Persian Governments had been at issue in respect to the precise line of frontier dividing their particular territories; and if the lines of telegraph belonging to the two states respectively were to be united at ail, some understanding on the point of junction was simply imperative. Now the village of Kasr-i-Shirin, or more strictly the post of 1 Major Champain to Government Secretary, Bombay.

Consequently from Kalab-i-Sabz to the westward, or towards Baghdad, Lieutenant Pierson could not carry on the construction of his line of telegraph without special authorization. Much valuable time had already been lost owing to this state of things, when the newly-appointed Persian Envoy Extraordinary to the Porte passed along the disputed tract from n to Constantinople, via Baghdad. The presence at the last-named city of so distinguished an official mio-ht it was reasonably inferred, be turned to account for remov ing the impediment existing to progress. Mirza Ilusain Khan was the man of all others to face the emergency. Active in mind and body, intelligent, ambitious, fond of Europeans, and experienced in Europe and its diplomacy, he readily took up the case, and proposed to Namik Pasha, Governor of Baghdad, a temporary equal division of disputed soi l. 'Pile latter, with much the same oppor tunities as the Persian, was a man of different stamp. His interests were ultra-conservative: his sympathies were with Asiatic bigotry, rather than European civi- hzation ; and though he did credit to his diplomatic training by fluent and well-accented French and a per fectly courteous address, yet his thin and wiry form. Sharp face with bluish grey eye, grey eyebrows and aquiline nose, and general exterior, were little sugges- •ve of social rapprochement. The two diplomatists, a a events, came to an amicable understanding on the irza s proposal, which was accepted as a temporary expedient: and a paper was drawn out for Lieutenant erson s guidance, which would enable him to return to232 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. his duty and resume operations. But while the Persian statesman left all details to the young English officer, the Turkish Pasha named his own agent—in this case, however, also an Englishman—to carry out the settle ment. Pierson joined up the wires at the point agreed, and worked Lack to Karmanshah, the head-quarters of his division. His own words describe the sequel : — ' When at Kirind the Governor of Karmanshah wrote to me ... to return to the frontier, and pull up part of the Turkish line, substituting Persian posts and wire . . . subsequently mo dified to desiring me to cut the wire at the junction. In answer I . . . asserted that as my duty was confined to taking measures for erecting and maintaining the line, . . if he wished . . to destroy it for political reasons, he must send his own agents to do so. He accordingly caused the wire to be cut at the point of junc tion, in which state it still remains.' It appears that the Shah had not consented to the compromise made at Baghdad as to the junction of the lines, a result explained by the existence at Tehran of influences hostile to his envoy. 1 Hence the lesson that if Oriental jealousy has a special end to attain and the power to attain it, that jealousy must be satisfied and that power appeased, however clearly the pleasure of the individual operate to the prejudice of the mass. On the other hand money may be scattered wholesale ; labour expended; life sacrificed in a cause, failure of which would affect thousands of persons, or even millions; all these considerations are as nothing with the other in the reasoning scale. But the temper and patience of the English superintendents was taxed in more than official 1 That these influences have pursued Mirza Husain Khan, more or less, throughout his career, see an article in the Pall Mall Gazette of Septemher 18, 1873, headed ' The Persian ex-Prime Minister.'iv.] SA VAGE A8SA ULT. 233 experiences. The internal condition of their own camps presented sometimes anything but quiet and good order. A Kurdi Farash in Lieutenant Pierson's service, on one occasion, savagely attacked and nearly killed with his sword two of his fellow-servants, grooms. Pierson, when first appearing on the ground, had seen the wounded men covered with blood ; and his own life was threatened by their assailant. 1 he soldiers of the working party actually aided in the assault, and refused to obey Lieu tenant Pierson's order to capture the head offender. Moreen er the Ivhan of the village of Kasr-i-Shirin would not arrest the man, though requested to do so, and though he was a notoriously bad character. As for the Governor of Kirind, who had originally recommended the latter to Lieutenant Pierson for employment, he coolly wrote to that officer, requesting him to return his Farash's sword and dagger, naturally retained by the offenders master after the affray. 1 Mr. Henry Walton, one of the two superintendents first on the spot, had undertaken the construction of the line from Karmanshah to Kangavar, as well as that from Kangavar to Tehran. His difficulties, independently of those of distance and country, consisted mainly in want of poles and local assistance, and in the desertion of workmen.

He had left Tehran on the 26th February, and reached Kum, a distance of eighty-five miles, on the day fol- lowing. ' On my arrival I was astonished to find that neither wire, insulators, nor tools had come from Ispahan, although the Per sian authorities there had been instructed, . . as early as the be- crinning of January, to forward them without delay. 1 at once sent a courier to Ispahan, on whose return I learnt that some had been sent to Kashan notwithstanding. . instructions to the Persian officers at Ispahan to despatch all the stores for Kum, before sending any of them anywhere else. I therefore sent the Mirza . . to Kashan with a letter to the Governor, requesting him to send on all the tools and a specified quantity of wire and in sulators to Kum. On the 13th March I received wire and insulators, but no tools. These I long afterwards found had been purposely kept back by the Persian Yawar at Ispahan, with the object of preventing work in my division until he himself should join it after completion of the line from Ispahan to Kohrud. There was, moreover, no Persian officer appointed to attend to my requisitions for workmen, transport and ma terials.' He applied to the Governor of Kum to get some tools made in the bazaar, and was told that orders to this effect were wanting from Tehran. When with great difficulty a supply of some kind had been obtained, lie applied for workmen. First came a few old men and boys; but after repeated remonstrances lie got a working paity o thirty labourers. ' As these men were either very badly paid or not paid at all, they naturally enough ran away, and others quite new to t it work had to be found. I at length prevailed on the Governor to . , . pay them 16 shahis (about &lt; ^d.) per day, in m} pi esc ncc, it was not till the 2oth March that this concession was made, and mules enough provided to enable me to move out of t ie town, form a camp, and fairly begin work.'WANT OF CARRIAGE. The Governor had introduced in his correspondence with Captain Smith a form of address marking his own superiority, which, if not a covert insult, at least was likely to be so interpreted in a country where worth is measured by position, and humility is another word for disgrace. For this a written apology was exacted and reluctantly given; but the ruler of Kum had other failings than vanity. ' Seeing a number of good poles (about COO) lying near the Chapar Khdnah} I asked the Governor how they happened to be there, if, as he assured me, there were more than enough laid out along the road within his territory ? lie replied that those I saw were the first that had been brought, but as he did not consider them good enough, lie had rejected them, and sent the others now lying scattered along the road, which were much longer and better in every way. This, I afterwards found, was utterly untrue, as the poles on the road were deficient in number, inost of them much too small, and none of them suitable for stretching-posts. I was therefore obliged, after nearly a month's delay at Kum, when the poles at the Chapar Khdnah might have been distributed, to carry all the stretching-posts required, and many of the ordinary ones, from the town, along the line as far as the boundary of the district of Tehran, a distance of forty-five miles.' Captain Smith had barely a sufficient number of mules for the carriage of wires, insulators and similar mate rials ; yet had he to make his own arrangements, not only for the conveyance of poles, but for a supply of bread to the workmen. 'In short,' he wrote, 'the Governor did almost nothing that I required, and I was only too thankful when left uninterrupted to do as best I could without his assistance.' 1 Posthouse.

On the 29th March arrived a Shahzadah, or Royal Prince, attached by the Persian Government to Captain Smith's division, to provide working parties and comply generally with the superintendent's requisitions. The Governor, in reporting the occurrence, took occasion to remark that his own connection with the telegraph had ceased, and that as he had presumed to allow the work to begin before the arrival of the specially-appointed officer, the Minister of Science had held him personally liable for all expenses incurred on its account. Under the new regime matters could scarcely be said to have mended. After two days' delay, Captain Smith arranged with his Persian assistant that the men should be paid at the same rate and in the same manner as before. Work was then recommenced, but progress was slow, owing to the continued interruptions caused by want of money, want of bread, and want of poles. A Government letter was shown, giving fifty of the king's mules for the service of the telegraph. But only thirty were actually forthcoming ; and of these, four were riding-mules for the use of muleteers, and out of the balance of twenty-six seldom more than twenty were available at a time. Twenty mules of the fifty were altogether mythical; for of them no account could be rendered. And with respect to two artillery carriages and eighteen horses, also reported at the disposal of the telegraph, their existence Avas not more real, for the service specified, than that of the twenty mules. On the 5th April, the Persian agent, coming to the telegraph camp, reported he could no longer pay the workmen, and proposed to revert to the system ot forced labour.

Captain Smith explains his position in the folio win &lt;'*■ manner:— ' The officer to whom alone I could give my requisitions had himself no power to fulfil them, without applying to another who refused to give the necessary supplies; so that if I addressed myself to the Governor, lie said he had nothing to do with me, and if to Ahul Fatli Mirza, the reply was that the Governor would give him nothing. The result was another stoppage of the work, and the breaking up of the working party which had been collected and partially instructed with great difficulty, and no resource was left me but an appeal to Tehran.' The appeal was made to her Majesty's Legation, whither Captain Smith at once repaired, riding in post to Tehran. He proposed that since the Persian Govern ment required the attendance of one of their own officers in each telegraph division, the respective Governors of towns within his range of superintendence should be instructed to comply with his requisitions made through the native agent, and to have the workmen daily paid in his presence. After a delay of ten days the necessary orders were procured. ^ e resume the quotations;— The tedious work of collecting and drilling a new lot of workmen had again to be gone through. In this I received no assistance from the Persian officers. Notwithstanding re peated applications, not a single man was sent either by the overnor or Abul Fath Mirza, so that, at a distance of fourteen miles from the nearest town or village, we had to get our work men as we Lest could ourselves. All my requisitions were e 0 ected in the same way, although there was now no excuse2 3 8 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. to offer, of want of orders. The artillery horses and carriages remained, as a rule, in Kum, only occasionally bringing out a load of stretching-poles, and I could not obtain a single mule besides those belonging to the king, notwithstanding a special clause regarding them in the orders I had brought from Tehran. 1 applied repeatedly for tents for the workmen, but none were o-iven, so that before we reached the inundation near llauz-i- Sultan, they had to walk daily a distance to and from their work of eighteen miles. 'With a camp pitched near the work, and mules enough to supply it with bread and water, nearly half of each day would have been saved. . . . T never succeeded in getting more than thirty-five men . . . and from want of mules half of them had always to be employed in carrying poles. Circumstances occurred to change the plan of opera tions. It had been intended to complete the line from Kum to Tehran; but it became necessary to stop about midway, and return to the former city, thence to work back to Kashan and Kohrud. Here again the old dif ficulties were revived ; and the newly -appointed Gov er nor of Kashan refused to lend any assistance whatever to the construction of the telegraph, as he had no orders from his Government. Moreover, in full accordance with the verbal asseveration of this functionary, when the working parties from Kum reached the Kashan boundary, none were there to replace them, and these being withdrawn, operations were suspended for six days. In this interval, orders appear to have been received from Tehran, and the Governor was in a position to comply with the requisitions of the British superin tendent. . From the 2nd to the 10th June, some thirty-six miles had been completed in the new direction. A brief delay was caused by the intervention of the Muharam fes tival ; but before the end of the month the boundar} oIV -J ' mudakhil.' 239 Nathenz had been reached, and the goodwill of the local authorities in that district enabled Captain Smith to join Ins line, through a long, rocky gorge, and in spite of physical obstacles unknown in the tracts he had lately quitted, to the line brought by his fellow-superintendent from Ispahan. Retiuniiig to Hauz-i-Sultan, lie laboured at complet ing the line thence to the capital : but as this part of his work has already been treated of in quotations from Major Champain's own report, we will take leave of Captain Smith with an extract from his concluding paragraph. He is speaking of the Persian agent in his camp, who had complained to him bitterly that his method of con ducting business had 'blighted his hopes of making what the Persians, by a quaint euphemism, call Mu- dakhil, or Income.' Perhaps it would be better trans lated as 'perquisites,' for that is the generally-understood meaning of the word. ' I had some difficulty in making him comprehend that Mudakhil in English went by a much harder name. From the highest official down to the meanest labourer, I found that all were actuated by the same principle. When they thought it possible to 'lake lludakhil, they were all activity, but when their income was interfered with by the system I adopted of seeing everything paid in my presence, and warning e villagers on no account to give 'presents' to any one, they relapsed into their usual state of obstinate in- dmerence. The habit here spoken of has indeed become second a ure. It appears to be engrained in the Persian child , than generated by education.

[chap. them mainly, though often unwittingly, by their conduct towards themselves, and it is highly probable that the Mudakhil principle is exercised more freely in dealings with Europeans than among co-religionists and fellow- countrymen. Lieutenant St. John's report of setting up the line in his division is a plain, straightforward statement. He does not enlarge on his difficulties in detail, but cannot conceal that he had to contend with 'delays, excuses and evasions ;' and gives more than one instance where he himself, or an assistant, suffered from the mismanage ment and spirit of peculation common to the native authorities. One working party refused to proceed with their duties, saying ' that they were tired of the work,' and ' this appeared a good and sufficient reason to the Persians,' who dismissed them. He commenced operations at Chahgodak, fifteen miles from Bushahr, on the IGth March, but returned in a few days to Bushahr, at the desire of Colonel Stewart, who had arrived there with the cable from Gwadar. Then, before resuming the more inland progress of his line, left temporarily under charge of Mr. Inspector Daniell, he erected, with Sergeant Isaacson's aid, a double line of wire from Bushahr to the landing-place of the cable, and connected Chahgodak, his original starting-point, with Bushahr. Owing to the passage of a tract of marshy ground called ' Mashilah,' in the neighbourhood of the latter place, the use of iron posts was considered a ne cessary precaution : but from the small number at his disposal, he could only place them over five miles, a space insufficient to include the whole extent of swamp- Lieutenant St. John estimates that altogether, in his division, 350 miles of wire, or about 7,000iv.] IIONOURA BLE MENTION. 241 posts, in round numbers, were erected in five months and two days. Taking into consideration the numerous disadvantages under which he and his party had laboured; the frequent delays; the laziness, dulness, and dishonesty of those from whom he was forced to procure help ; the great natural difficulties; and that the work had been carried on at the most unfavourable season of the year, the line had, in his opinion, been erected with a fair amount of solidity, and in a reason able time. 'In a few places,' he adds, ' improvements, suggested by our more perfect knowledge of the road, may be advisable, and I anticipate some trouble from the green poles, which have been, faute de mieux, put up on some parts of the line ; but altogether I trust and believe that interruptions will not be more frequent in this division than elsewhere.' This officers favourable mention of two or three of his Persian assistants forms a gratifying exception to the reports of his colleagues. One of them, whom we need not designate by name, displayed conspicuous energy and activity. The speedy completion of one part of the line was considered due ' to his unwearied efforts.' And a hope was expressed that his ' services might be brought to the notice of the Government of his Majesty the Shah.'' 1 Lieutenant St. John acknowledges further having expe rienced the greatest politeness, and readiness to comply with requests, from the Wazir of Shiraz and Governor of Bushahr, and an ' unvarying willingness '' to carry out his requisitions 'to the utmost of his ability ' from 1 The recommendation appears to have resulted ill.

[chap. the Persian superintendent of telegraphs in the province of Fars. The illness and departure of Mr. Man, the officer originally appointed to the fourth division, has already been mentioned. That gentleman died immediately after his return to England. No separate report of the divi sion under his charge accompanied Major Champain's general letter to the Bombay Government : but the Director bore flattering testimony to the manner in which Mr. Hoeltzer had taken up and completed the work of the deceased superintendent. Such, then, is the narrative of the construction of the new Persian line of telegraph, and setting up the first wire under Mr. Eastwick's convention, and in connection with the whole scheme of telegraphic communication with India, as approved by her Majesty's Government and eventually carried into execution by the officers em ployed. In reviewing the several reports submitted on the subject, we have shown that the Turco-Persian frontier between Baghdad and Karmanshah presented a political obstacle which, if not removed, might be wholly fatal to the use of the Persian telegraph as an alter native to the Indo-Ottoman lines to the Gulf. Pre vention, it may be said, is better than cure; and the mischief should have been foreseen and obviated. But what better prevention could there be for the contin gency, than a separate treaty for the Baghdad-Tehran line between the Persians and Turks themselves ? And such a treaty had been formally agreed upon between the Sublime Porte and the Shah of Persia on the 28tli November, 1863, about six months before the fiat went forth to sever the connection of the two lines effected by British officers : a fiat which was literally carried out.IV.] TURCO-PERSIA N CON VENT 10N. 243 Doubtless, the Porte was not well pleased that a Persian alternative line should partake of the profits of an Indo-Ottoman line of telegraph, constructed under agreement with her Majesty's Government; and the correspondence printed for Parliament shows that it had required some persuasion and much despatch writing to gain its acquiescence in the India Office views hereon. Ali Pasha, the Turkish Foreign Minister, had eventually, however, yielded to the urgency of the occasion, and consented to the British proposals put before him under conditions stated in a protocol signed by himself and Mr. Erskine, in the absence of the English Ambassador, Sir Henry Bulwer. Having already summarised the purport of this document, we shall now only refer to the 9th Article, which may be appropriately quoted m extenso : 'All the despatches addressed to, or coming from India, shall he equally divided between the line from Baghdad to Basrah on tlie one hand, and that of Khanikin on the other. To avoid all difficulty of execution, the application of this system of division shall be as follows: ' All despatches coming from India shall pass by the line iioni Khanikin. On the other hand, all those for India shall be sent by the line from Baghdad to Basrah.' r Ilie protocol was subsequently modified, at Sir Charles Wood's suggestion, to the extent of leaving messages to be forwarded indifferently from Baghdad, or vice versd from Bushahr, by either Turkish or Persian line.

Article II. may well provoke a smile in its prospective arrangements, as may the two last articles, for the con fident manner in which they notify the conclusion of a satisfactory agreement. We have just shown that six months after date the lines could not, from political reasons, be joined at any one point, and that not only the I urco-Persian, but the Anglo-Persian arrangements for telegraphic communication ran a risk of serious obstructions because there was no acknowledged line of frontier at all. As regards Article VIII. the Ottoman Government must have either forgotten, or held of minor importance, the division of messages therein expressed. For a reference to the Indo-Ottornan Con vention, of which a summary is given in our second chapter, will show that according to its Article XIV. messages to or from India were to be forwarded vid Basrah or Khanikin, ' according to convenience of ser vice,'' nothing being said at all of one route for India- going messages, and another for those received from the Indian cable. That the difficulties were removed, and the line even tually opened to a short-lived traffic, at one time sjms- modic, at another desultory, will be shown in the next chapter.

Kemball reported his proceedings in anticipation of orders afterwards received, and on an understanding between himself and Namik Pasha. Mr. Inspector Joyce Perceval, with whom was associated Yuzbashi Omar Faizi Efendi, had commenced the first section to Hilleh. Particular duties were assigned to Mr. Carthew, Mr. Greener, and the non-commissioned officers from Persia; and the political agent proposed proceeding himself to the quarter ' where alone any serious difficulties might be apprehended,' accompanied by a duly authorized Turkish officer. 1 Mr. Joyce Perceval had experienced some trouble in reaching his destination. He had followed the Damascus route, through the Syrian desert to Baghdad, and in reporting his arrival at the latter city he described how he had been robbed by the Bedouins of his property, and even strij^ped of personal clothing save ' shoes, drawers, flannel shirt, and Turkish cap.' As regards his after dealings with the Arabs he has himself published an account, placing on record useful data connected with his professional work. 2 The distribution of material arriving from Liverpool was a matter, in some cases, of considerable embarrass ment. Disturbances arose among the Arab tribes whereby the stores were wantonly subjected to loss, detention, and injury; but the lives of those engaged in distributing them, as in the work of construction gene rally, were exposed to serious risk.

Thus, for a time, action was necessarily suspended ; and the great heats of summer had super vened before operations could be fairly resumed. The interval was, however, turned to good account in esta blishing telegraph stations and otherwise maturing pre parations for the contemplated through traffic; and on the return of autumn, so soon as order had been suffi ciently restored, the working parties were again in the field, and eventually, from a point near Kurna, where the two great rivers meet, a telegram despatched to England on one side and Bombay on the other, an nounced completion of the line. This was on the 27th January, 1865. An important period had undoubtedly been reached in the annals of the Indo-European telegraph, and an important event announced to the world at large. But let us examine why the twofold telegram could not be said to sound a note of practical completion of the work contemplated. When the year 1864 came to a close, the cable had been brought successfully from the Indian side to the mouth of the Basrah river, and was in good working order from Karachi to Fao. The Persian land-line had been com pleted from Baghdad to Bushahr. Colonel Stewart, prostrated by severe sickness, was at Constantinople, in daily expectation of hearing that Baghdad had joined the Persian lines on one side, and Basrah on the other. The new year had but just commenced, when Patrick Stewart sank under his attack. Before the month of January had passed away, or in the early days of February, a few messaoes had stru&lt;x2ded through the lines from India to O OO 0 Europe ; notably one from the Duke of Brabant, then248 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [ch. iv. an illustrious traveller in the East. But there was no decisive success achieved wherewith to signalize the particular period. So long as five days was considered a respectable time for Calcutta to communicate with London, and that few messages traversed the distance so speedily as this, so long was it necessary to suspend the shout of victory or cheer of congratulation. Tele grams brought good news from below Baghdad, and brilliant promises from Persia, but hitches would occur somewhere, and the line was too long and the working of too novel and promiscuous a character for speedy repairs and corrections. In fine, the opening of commu nications was comparatively lame and unattended with eclat, and the science and energy which were available to make light of physical hindrance, were sorely taxed in dealing with national jealousies and the caprice of individuals. tomb 01 f-sthku and mokdf.cai. at h a m a dan. westeiin' 1'f.ksia.CHAPTER V. political and other difficulties in the indo-persian and indo-ottoman telegraphs. convention with persia of 23RD november, 1865, for second wire. —second convention proposed, in following year, for extending land telegraph, and providing an alternative line to the cable between gwadar and bushahr ; put aside in the spring, but revived in the winter of 1867, and concluded in greatly modified form in 186D. diplomatic action ^hereon. fulfilment of convention of 1865. reports of officers concerned. At the period of Colonel Stewart 's demise. Major Cham- pain was at Tehran, doing his utmost to turn the lines under his charge to immediate account. But the task was of no common difliculty. He had reported com pletion of the line from Baghdad to Bushahron the 13th October, 1864, and that it would ' in all probability be open to the public in a few days.' On the 31st of the same month it became his duty to explain that very un satisfactory relations existed with the local authorities ; and until matters were mended in this respect it would be impossible for the British officers to remain at their posts in Persia. The following statement will require2r )0 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. no comment in illustration of the position . Tehran must be looked upon as an apex from which two lines of telegraph are drawn to the southward and westward respectively. When the first and longer line to Bushahr was inaugurated at the end of Septembci, by some in advertence a land-line instrument had not been maclt over to that station, so that messages had to be for warded thence to Shiraz direct from the cable office. Accordingly, the needed article was supplied by Major Champain's orders a few days later; but the 1 ersian clerks were not sufficiently expert to be trusted with its working. The Minister of Public Works at Tehran, hearing of these arrangements, sent instructions to a Persian clerk at Shiraz to prevent the English from talking with Bushahr by disconnecting theii instrument, and these instructions were arbitrarily carried out under protest of the English Inspector. Major Champain was made acquainted with the circumstances, and appealed to the Persian officials concerned, urging that unless orders of the kind were communicated through him, or at least with his cognizance, his authority would become invalidated, to the detriment of the public service. From this action resulted a further order to cut the wire, and the execution of that order. The Director then considered he had no course open but to remove his instruments from Shiraz and Ispahan, and disconnect those at Tehran ; and, having so proceeded, laid Ins case before her Majesty's minister. The complaint was rendered graver still by the conduct of the Persian authorities at Ispahan, where they had attempted foicible seizure of the instruments, and where the English super intendent had forbidden those of his countrymen under his orders to enter the city or Persian Telegraph Office.v ] DAMAGE TO PERSIAN WIRE. 251 It was only on the 7tli December that Major Cham- pain was enabled to report a better state of things, and the probability of soon re-opening communication be tween Baghdad and Bushahr. The Persian Government had agreed to give the English staff control of the tele graph offices, and working the line for five months from the date of renewing correspondence with India. The Minister of Public Works was to be acknowledged head of all telegraphs in Persia; but would issue no orders on the lines from Tehran to Khanikin or Bushahr, without the cognizance and consent of the British Director, whose suggestions should be carefully respected. After five months the English were to leave the country, making over the entire line to the Persians; but it was O proposed to retain one Engineer officer and two assistants at Tehran, in a consultative capacity, for a further period of ten months. A formal and satisfactory apology had been offered for the behaviour of the Governors retainers at Ispahan. These were the salient points of the statement submitted to the Bombay Government. The question of rates, though discussed in the same letter, has too little interest in its minutiae to be here considered. Suffice it to mention that the result was expressed in a subsequent communication of the 13th December, reporting the determination of a fourteen- shilling tariff for a through message by Persia. But this last-noted letter gave official currency to a dis heartening rumour, proved since to be too true, that ' great damage had been done to the wire between Shiraz and the sea;' consequently that some fifteen or twenty days might elapse before communication could he renewed with India. With regard to the Turkish frontier. Major Champain understood that ' the Shah■, f ■' IP ! (pifj had consented to the demands of the Porte,'' and believed that reply to a despatch forwarded some weeks before to Constantinople was only waited ' to join up the wire near Khanikin and open throughout.' The facts were these. Colonel Kemball, the British Resident and Consul-General at Baghdad, after pro posing every possible combination that seemed likely to reconcile or allay conflicting claims, hit upon the happy expedient of turning to account the telegraph poles used by the litigants respectively, to represent the national interests involved : that is to say, as the Turks used iron, and the Persians wooden posts for their respective lines, it was considered that alternate iron and wooden posts over the disputed tract would illustrate a mutual understanding, or perhaps rather the recognition of a misunderstanding, in a manner at once politically safe and socially unobjectionable. This arrangement, fortified by the inevitable exchange of statu quo declarations, was finally accepted by both parties, and is believed to be in force at the present day. On the 20tli January, 1865, Major Champain wrote from Tehran, 1 little knowing that his report of progress would no longer interest him to whom they were usually addressed, giving a more cheery account of his charge. ' We are now open,' he said, ' and working with Karmanshah since the 24th December (to say nothing of one break, which was mended in a day); with Ispahan since the 2nd of January, and now, again, with Shiraz. The line is all right to Baghdad, but the Turks refuse to receive our messages.' His account of the interruption beyond Shiraz made 1 To Col.

But the case may now be stated by the light of after inquiry and corroboration. When the wires were authoritatively cut between Shiraz and the sea-coast, the British cable office at Bushahr was debarred communication with the interior ; and before traffic was resumed very severe damage had been done to the materiel by villagers, travellers, and especially Iliats, or nomads, migrating from their hilly summer quarters to the lower and warmer seaboard. Lieut. St. John, about the time of the Tehran difficulty, had been driven to sea by a severe attack of fever; and on return to Shiraz in December, verified the extent of mischief, and found that for twenty miles along the tract taken by the Iliats from the capital of Fars to the Kothal Dukhtar the line had been almost totally destroyed. The long spans, which had cost so much time and labour to erect, had been cut down; out of GOO consecutive insulators only twenty remained un broken ; and the wire w T as severed in pieces and lying on the ground, or confusedly festooned round the poles, many of which had been used for firewood. Fortunately Lieut. St. John was enabled to trace one main offender, whose position as a clan chief of the powerful Kashkai tribe made his punishment politically important. He had caused the fall of the large span across the Kothal Pir Zan, by smashing a lower supporting insulator with a bullet from his gun. By this time affairs had been amicably settled in Tehran, and the Persians generally were desirous to see the new telegraph working in their country, so that the reports of occurrences on the Shiraz- Lushahr line were doubly distasteful and untimely. To repair the harm done, a month was estimated necessary.254 TELEORAFH AND TRAVEL. [chap. JMr. Alison represented the case to the Shah, who was pleased to issue stringent orders for the seizure and punishment of the culprits. Mirza Jiafar Khan, second in rank among Persian telegraph magnates, was ordered to proceed at once by chctjx^v to Shiraz, with a royal executioner, to cut oil any heads Lieut. St. John might indicate. Ali Khan Beg, the offending Kashkai chief, was to be sent in chains to Tehran, and a fine of a thousand tomans (400Z.) was to be levied from the Ilkhani, or head of the nomad tribes—a chief suffi ciently powerful in Southern Persia to boast he can bring into the field in ten days a force of 20,000 horse and 30,000 foot. This programme was carried out with an approach to completeness rare in Oriental states. The Sarhang, minus, however, the executioner, posted down to Shiraz, found and seized Ali Khan Beg, whose existence was at first positively denied by the Governor of Shiraz, squeezed the prescribed fine from the Il khani, plus a second thousand for his chief in Tehran, and 500 tomans for himself, and plundered the village of Dastiarjan, where he had been insulted by the vil lagers. But whatever the actual details by which the movement was followed, the spirit of the king s message was unmistakeable. The royal anger was aroused and made itself felt; and the despatch of a special envoy with full instructions and power to act, together with the decisive action resulting from his mission, changed the state of affairs as regards the telegraph from danger to security. 1 As to the contretemps by which the 1 Major St. John, to whom I am indebted for this correction of official reports, written necessarily on imperfect information, states that during the nine years that have elapsed from the period in questionless willul damage as been done to the telegraph in Fars, the most turbulent province of Persia, t an in any other part of the line.

These particulars form the subject of an official com munication of two days later date, addressed to the Government of Bombay. The despatch concluded with the statement that on the 21st of January the Shah had paid a Msit of some two hours duration to the telegraph office, conversing there, through the wires, with the Governois oi Sluraz, Esjiahan, Kashan, Ivum, Hamadan and Karmanshah. ' His Majesty,' it was observed, was very much pleased with the arrangements, and is impatient to be able to communicate with Europe and India.' 1 Subsequent correspondence tends to prove that the mischief done between Shiraz and Bushahr was too great, and the interest expressed by Persian officials in atoning for it much too artificial, for speedy restoration of through communication. Before the arrival on the scene of disaster of the telegraph Sarhang above-men tioned, the damage done to the wire, on the first burst of violence, had been nearly doubled. The chief of Chahkutah, a village twenty miles from Bushahr, de stroyed the line up to five miles from that town; and in other places much additional mischief was wrought. Spans of exceptionally great length had been cut down, and the labour of setting up the wires over very difficult m durance vile for two months, was at his (St. John's) request excused a rney o Tehran which might have had most disagreeable results, and set fri 0f P ollcy which has had the happy effect of securing the endship of the Kashkai chiefs to the English Telegraph officers. 1 'ijor Champain to Secretary to Government, Bombay.

It was a question of time ; and on the 20th of February, when Major Champain reported that, owing to his nomination from the Secretary of State to perform the late Colonel Stewart's duties in the telegraph, he was about leaving Tehran for Constanti nople, the Persian line was only working well between Shiraz and Baghdad. Below Shiraz, communication had not been fully restored. Captain Murdoch Smith, R.E., assumed charge of the Anglo-Persian telegraph on Major Cham pain's departure. Although ripened acquaintance with the character of the people among whom he was thrown scarcely warranted the belief that his official duties would be plain sailing, the new Director undertook them with a strong wish as well as natural power to conciliate ; and had already proved himself in his Persian career well deserving the 44 perfect confidence ' reposed in him by his predecessor. There is no doubt, however, that the year's experience gained by our officers in Persia, and by the Persians of our officers, had been productive of good : and had not the general behaviour of the non-commissioned officers and men from Chatham been of an exemplary kind, opera tions could never have continued with such comparative smoothness for so long a period in the mere matter of individual complaints. The second year of employ ment of a British telegraph staff in Persia had much ol brightness and good augury in' its dawn. The Shah had evinced his personal interest in the cause they repre sented : the Governors of provinces had shown a liking for, as well as courtesy towards the officers with whom they had become acquainted ; and one or more of thev.] telegraphy at khan1kin 9v7 ZO / most rigid and influential opponents of the original scheme actually expressed anxiety for the proloncation of English superintendence. The line between Shiraz and the sea was again put into working order, and the Persian alternative lines were at last fairly turned to account. But on the Turco- Persian frontier all arrangements had the semblance of political patching, of compromise, of temporary ex- pcdients. Actual honest work was clearly at a discount. Major Champain reached Baghdad on the 5th March having carefully scrutinised the line defects apparent on the road, and sending a through message to India from the I ersian frontier post of Kasr-i-Shirin. The Karnian- shah ofhce he had found in good order, and signals were constantly received there from Khanikin on the Turkish Side; but Khanikin would or could make nothing of tlie rersian replies. 0 ' I thorofore set out,' he tells Mr. Alison, 'and, with Corporal aloim tlm r ''f a S T 11 instr,lment . marched leisurely weTk bl lne r as Kasr-i-Shirin.

The case was stated to Namik Pasha, who directed Monsieur Oudit, a French inspector in the Turkish service, to proceed to Khanikin without delay. He was to test the iron posts in case the defects were not dis covered in the office, regulating future proceedings by the result of his inspection. A European sergeant would also take a battery and instrument to Kasr-i-Shirin, there to open a testing office, so as to determine at once whether the fault was in Persia or Turkey. That the line was open on the 12th March, by the Persian as Indo-Ottoman lines, is clear from Major Champain's Baghdad telegram of that date to Captain Smith at Tehran, notifying the willingness of the Turkish Telegraph Administration to send half the Indian mes sages by the Persian route, hut their complaint at the same time of the slow working, and impossibility to communicate direct with Bushahr. The number of mes sages was reported to be very great. But as Major Champain was at this time only passing through BaghdadV.J 68 MILES PER DIEM, FOR 10 DAYS, 259 en route to Constantinople, we will change the scene to the latter city, and see what was the condition of the telegiaph there on that officer's arrival. It was the 12th April when he came to Misseri's Hotel, somewhat ailing and very sunburnt, after sixteen days'hard postino- over 1,100 miles to Samsun ; from which port to the Golden Horn a three days' passage in the Austrian steamer was a pleasant relief. Colonel Goldsmid, of the Madras Staff Corps, was It has lieeu shown, at Constantinople at the period of Colonel Stewart's fatal illness. Although his presence there, in the previous August, had been in immediate connection with the work of the telegraph, and con sequent on his inspection of the Turkish-Asiatic lines between Baghdad and Izmid, his official associations with the young Chief Director had virtually ceased before the close ol the year. He had proceeded home with lie telegraph Treaty in September, but was suddenly- sent out again with a view of continuing his journey from Constantinople to Tehran. At Constantinople the particular news which had caused his deputation beino- ouud erroneous, he was further delayed under orders from England ; and eventually he received new instruc tions for a special service. It was while preparing to for 1 otl H tlle Russian steamer, that his friend's serious illness caused him to hesitate in his movements, and to defer embarkation from week to week.

On the 25th January a telegram from Colonel Kemball announced that completion of the Baghdad-Basrah line was expected on the day following; but that the Persian line showed signs of breakage. This intelligence was despatched at once by the wires from Constantinople towards London. But the lines connecting the Turkish capital with the capitals ot northern and western Europe were so untrustworthy that it was hard to say when a Sublime Porte message would reach Downing Street. Tn fact, at the period of his illness and demise. Colonel Stewart was seeking to impress upon the Ottoman authorities that two great desiderata for securing efficiency in the Indo-European telegraph were : 1st, the establishment of two special wires for the service in Europe and Turkey ; and 2nd, the instruction of employes on the European-inrkisli lines, who were better acquainted with the English tongue than those then entertained. And as for the lines in Asiatic Turkey, even when completed, if a telegram reached Constantinople in five days from Karachi, the fact was considered something of a feat. This, too, as late as the 10 th February, very shortly after which date interruptions were reported on the last finished section, or that between Baghdad, Basrah, and the sea.

The results of the months of February and March are shown to be as follows but it must be borne in mind that the line was not fairly open during a greater part of the former month :— In February : 10 messages were despatched from Constantinople to Karachi, whereof the avernfe time in transit was two days and eleven hours, the longest time taken being seven days and the shortest six hours. On the other hand, 52 were received from Karachi, whereof the average time in transit w T as eight hours and twenty minutes, the longest time being fifteen days and four hours, and the shortest five hours. In March : 324 messages were despatched from Con stantinople, whereof the average time in transit was two hours and four minutes, the longest time taken being six days, and the shortest six hours. From Karachi 262 telegrams were received in an average time of two days and eight hours, the longest time being six days and an hour, and the shortest six hours. Perhaps the most cheering sign of improvement was that, of the total of the above messages, 22 reached Karachi and 30 Constantinople within twelve hours, and 41 and G1 the same places respectively within twenty- four hours. riiis account, it will be observed, makes no allowance foi the time taken up between London and Constanti nople, which was usually considerable.

A-lthough the in formation contained in these replies was mostly known to the questioner from verbal inquiries, its embodiment in a record rendered it a useful groundwork for decisive action.

At all events, the Secretary assured Colonel Goldsmid some days afterwards that he had spoken upon the subject to his Highness, who wished existing arrangements to hold good until a new line, sanctioned by the Porte for traffic to western Europe and more especially for Indo-European messages, had been constructed and tried. In the midst of much disappointment and vexation it was something satis factory to find that on the 24th March a telegram reached Scutari from Bombay in something like seven •/ O hours. Mashes ol really good working were now occasional. The Armenian Secretary having been called to London on the perpetually recurring question of Ottoman finance, the official control of foreign telegraph arrange ments, under the Minister, became vested in the 'Musta- shir, a iurkish authority ot considerable inliuence. But although more influential than his Christian col league, who was rather a ' Chef de correspondance ' than a responsible adviser, the capacity for business was clearly on the side of the latter, who was a thorough adept in the ways and workings of the bureaux of western Europe, in either case it was pleasant to deal with men untrammelled by any departmental etiquette in respect of telegraphy; and to whose office the Director- general for the time being was necessarily subordinate in all questions of international discussion. At the particular season referred to, the same chance which took from his post at head-quarters the Foreign Under- Secretary, Abru Efendi, had removed temporarily Agathon Efendi, the very courteous, intelligent, andv 'j report of slow progress. 2(i5 Colonel Stewart had been referred for disposal to the Government of India. Meanwhile Major Champain was holding temporary charge of the whole Indo-European line, so far as the control or responsibility of the British Government was concerned ; and his arrival at Constantinople has been mentioned. After a stay of three days in that city, during which the state of affairs was then discussed with Colonel Goldsmid, Major Champain continued his journey to London, reachino- it by the Danube route on the 20th April, or within a month after quitting Baghdad, inclusive of halts A month later Colonel Goldsmid was on his way home in obedience to a telegraphic summons from the Secretary of State.

' I have called . . attention . . to the apparent neglect of orders on the part of the Ottoman employes in Asia, whether as regards fulfilment of the provisions in the Brussels Convention, or the ordinary duties of the service. The time taken up in trans mission, irregularity in mode of despatch, the indilferent orthography of the telegrams—all these subjects have been more or less dwelt on in my letter to the acting Director General. Allusion has also been made to his own verbally expressed in tentions to increase the personnel of the Asiatic line, and his admission to myself that the Indian work is greater than he had expected. I have, moreover, urged the necessity of keeping pace in Asia with the improvements about to be introduced into European telegraphic correspondence under the late Paris Con vention, such as direct communication, by large wires, with principal towns like Baghdad : and have again warned him of probable diminution of traffic owing to the defects ot the service. ' At the same time I cannot disclaim the hopes expressed at the conclusion of my letter ot the 5th ult. Doubtless very great delays occur in India, many in Europe out of Turkish territory, which are erroneously attributed to the Ottoman Administration. Indeed there are data to establish the truth of this supposition; and .1 therefore feel reluctant without further information to press too closely the question of delay in the more recent tele grams. Perhaps the surest and satest way to obtain a satisfac torily working line would be to supplement the present convention with certain clauses admitting a joint control, on our part at least, on the Asiatic side; and having Anglo-Turkish stations such as Fao . . at Baghdad, Diarbekir and Sivas, or Angora. With these new personnels, might be associated one or two qualified inspectors.

There is no doubt that such a proposal would not be entertained without the use of many and plausible ar-u- ments for a contrary course, and I should not feel warranted^in suggesting it here without special orders. Under any circum stances, however, the first and most natural proceeding would be to submit to the Ottoman Government the complaints which now present themselves ; and on bringing the subject of the enclosed letter to the acting Director General of Ottoman Tele graphs to the consideration of the higher authorities at the Porte 1 shall be simply continuing the line of conduct authorized bv the original instructions of the Eight lion, the Secretary of State.'

Of the messages sent from Constantinople on the 5th March, some reached Karachi via Fao in 31, and some in 136 hours ! Yet with all this irregularity and uncertainty, the traffic returns of April had been financially promising. Some 2,180 messages had been exchanged against 1,447 of the previous month, the main increase being in the telegrams to India from Europe. Any detailed account of negotiations such as these, or of the financial and promiscuous kind with which Pera is especially familiar, can have no great public interest. A whole winter and a month or so ol summer, autumn, and spring making, inclusive of breaks, a more than six months' residence there in the years 1864-65, chiefly at Misseri's Hotel, but partly on the Bosphorus—would not be unpleasant under certain circumstances. But regarded in an official point of view, the retrospect is not sufficiently bright to dwell upon in a narrative of early telegraph operations. The history would be rather that of an inner individual existence than of an agent of progress, and would tell more of anxiety and doubt, of hope and disappointment, than of practical measures and ready execution, or ot combination and co-operation of two Administrations to accomplish a mutually desirable end. And for these reasons the record may reasonably pass away like the smoke of the many cigarettes which invariably open, prolong, and conclude every sort of mixed mejlis at the Sublime Porte. When Colonel Goldsmid, some five weeks after Ins return home from Turkey, left London in June 1865 foi Persia, Major Champain remained in England on duty, receiving such references as were intended for the Chiev.] THE Am ST ANT CHIEF DIRECTOR. 2(19 Director, and where practicable, disposing of them. The great length of the Indo-European line, the number of Administrations concerned in its working, and the neces- sit} of giving t i,s much attention to the European section which was in foicign hands, as to the Asiatic lines, which were partly those of the British Government, partly those of the contracting States, gave more than the colour of expediency to such a measure ; rather did it seem an essential to successful organization at the commencement of proceedings. Thus it became the practice, during the early years of this telegraph, that while the Chief Direc tor's duties called him to Persia or India, his assistant should remain at the European end of the line, and vice versa : and in reviewing the results of this arrange ment, which met with the sanction of the Home Govern ment, it cannot be considered other than sound and judicious. On his return from Tehran and Baghdad in April, Major Champain had availed himself of the oppor tunity to place the fruits of his Persian experience personally before the Secretary of State and India Office Committee of Public Works and Telegraphs ; and a Draft leaty on a basis sketched out by Colonel Stewart, and referred to his assistant at Tehran shortly before his death, was in readiness for the new Chief Director to take out to Mr. Alison, a very few days after his arrival. t t. Petersburg, Colonel Goldsmid placed on record is Views and impressions on the question of tariffs, in t ie event of competition. However willing the Turks Had been to meet the wishes of her Majesty's Govern ment m securing telegraphic communication with India, ley had failed to render it so speedy and effective as to merit the confidence of the public. A four months' experience was not without value in forming a judgment270 TJELEGBAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. on the sliortcomiugs of the line. The frequent com plaints of irregularity and delay which had been made by persons using the wires had been formally brought to the notice of the Ottoman Administration. Remedies had been proposed, such as increased establishment, im proved inspection, and the like ; and there was reason to believe that some had, at least, been applied. Still was it apprehended that a public, free to use its own means of communication, would avail itself readily ot an alter native to the Ottoman line, or any part of it, should one offer of a more reliable and less costly nature. The Russian lines of the Caucasus having been extended to Julfa on the Araxes, or Persian frontier, and the Per sian line completed from Julfa to Tehran, it was clear that telegraphic communications between England and India, vid St. Petersburg and Persia, might be carried out at once quite independently of the Ottoman lines. It was only a few days before, that one of the telegraph companies had transferred its whole messages to tins route ; and although circumstances had induced a speedy return to the original way, such an occurrence was of itself sufficient to point out the danger incurred by in attention to remedy the defects of the Ottoman telegraph in a reasonable time. Inefficient as the staff of tbe Russian lines might be found for the Indian service, it was clear that, under pressure, a very short period would suffice to supply the want, as also to turn to account the Persian line from Julfa to iehran. Supposing even the two lines working equally well, and to be equally worthy the confidence of the public, the tariff of the Russo-Persian line was so much lower than that acknowledged in Turkey that fair competition would be quite out of the question. Here was a difli-THE QUESTION OF TARIFF. 271 culty wliicli could only be met by an understanding with Russia. Should it be proposed to utilize her lines eliectually for Indian communications, increased outlay would demand, no doubt, a revision of tariff. Otherwise it could scarcely be held a reasonable request that she should raise her charges to suit the Ottoman rates. The regulation of such a tariff* might however be pro posed as would enable the Turks, if necessary, to reduce their own charges ; and not only so, but to remove the anomaly of a double rate of messages which Persia had adopted with reference to Russia and England respec tively. 1 Finally, a communication might be addressed to the Ottoman Government on the subject, pointing out that their own interests as well as those of the public w T ere concerned in the reconsideration of rates and belief in possible competition ; and that any arrangements made with the Russian Government, with reference to tele graphic communications to and from India through Russian territory, must be understood with intent to regulate, on a clear basis, the question of through rates by that line, and not in any way to draw off the traffic from the Turkish route, should that route succeed in giving satisfaction to the public. Much to this effect was put into writing and de spatched for consideration of the home authorities. And though action may not have been taken upon the sug gestions conveyed, it would have been blindness on the writer's part to have ignored, as it would have been cul pable to conceal, a state of things the bearing of which 1 Russia, by Convention with Persia, had fixed a certain tariff on all imsagcs passing between her frontier and Bushahr. England, by a separate Convention, had laid down a tariff equally hi 0 h, or higher, for about two- thirds of the same distance.272 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. on the prospective interests of Indo-European telegraphy was so manifestly important. 1 The Assistant Director, imbued with similar ideas, and beset on all sides by complaints against the working of the Turkish lines both in Europe and Asia, lost no time in studying the question in detail; and by virtue of Ins official position in London, submitted to Government a proposal for practical improvement of the defective com munications which, though, from intelligible motives, not warmly received at the outset, will be considered in a subsequent chapter, in its relation to the existing Russo- Persian line to India. Colonel Goldsmid reached Tehran on the 1st August, but it was not until the 4th December that he was enabled to quit the Persian capital with the satisfactory consciousness that a Convention had been concluded of a sufficiently binding nature to secure a two-wired line of telegraph available for Anglo-Indian correspondence, at least for a period of five years from date of comple tion. One of the two wires was to be exclusively under the direction of an English engineer officer and assistants, i In my diary, under date Astrakhan, July 18, 1865, is this entry : ' The more I consider the question of our Indo-European Telegraphic cor respondence, the more does success seem to me to rest on two great lines: ' 1st. The Indo-Ottoman, which seems to have become an acknowledged name for the line through Baghdad and Basrah ; ' 2iid. The Russo-Persian, or the line through Moscow and Tiflis to Tabriz and Bushahr. ' If these premises be admitted, our plan would be to enter into certain terms for the use of one, as we have done with the other ; and then for both to remain open to the public to choose which proves the best, lo avoid al preponderating influence on one side, Russia might arrange with the Persians for the communication between Julfa and Tehran as we do from Tehran to Bushahr. The connecting link between Baghdad and Tehran need, as a ru c, be used only for Turco-Persian internal communication, and all dispute on division of messages would cease.'273 v.J TELEGRAPH CONVENTION OF 1865. the whole number of British Government employes not exceeding fifty. Under sufferance the staff had already numbered thirty-eight, inclusive of the medical officer r 1 but henceforward the limits would be authoritatively enlarged. How this Convention was produced at all out of the draft taken to 1 ersia, or how it differed so materially from the latter as to cause relationship to be barely recognised, was of course officially explained : but the history of the whole procedure would perhaps be tedious, and little relevant in this place, and is rather illustra tive of national characteristics than any particular stage in the development of telegraphic communications with the East. The Persian Government, whatever disposed to sanc tion in practice, from friendly or political motives, was loth to commit to paper, and especially in the form of Treaty or Convention, to be read and commented on by other Powers, anything which might be construed into admission of need, whether of material, men, and money, or whether of moral supervision and administrative 1 Shortly after arrival I found the number of employes to be 1 director and 3 superintendents 4 At Tehran, 1 traffic manager, 1 non-commissioned officer,) and 5 clerks j 7 At Ispahan, 1 inspector and 3 clerks 4 At Shiraz, 1 non-commissioned officer in charge and 2 clerks 3 At Bushahr, 1 inspector and 4 clerks . 5 At Hamadan, 1 clerk j At Karmanshah, 1 head clerk, 2 clerks 3 On line-duty generally , . . . 10 Total 37 redtTJf 0f ^ r ' ;Baker ' in medical charge.

Guided by this principle, it made a determined stand on conceding without accepting, and in confining its concessions to as narrow limits as possible. No better exponent of such a policy or stricter guardian of its integrity could be found than the Foreign Minister of the day i and as even the most inciHcient attempt to Slip his position required an unusual exercise of patience and perseverance, it may well be understood that success^as not achieved without time and labour, ihe ta^k ^as, in short, one of delicacy and difficulty ; and the more so, because all former agreements on telegraph matters with England had been but provisional, and knotty points reserved for a regular Convention. It may be further generally stated, without entering into the minutiae of discussion, that Persia, at the outset, strongly insisted on paying for all constructive objects out of her own treasury, and setting up the required second wire herself. According to the argument used, the Government was solvent: Persian telegraphers were becoming expert: with the aid of the Lnglish officers for another three months, they would be able to carry on the work very well; at all events, at the expiration of three months, what was to be farther done could be deliberated and determined. The Turks worked their own lines ; why should not the Persians likewise ? They had too much sense of shame (khajdlat) to undertake what they could not perform. As regards the cost of working the line for Anglo-Indian messages, let Persia receive a fixed sum of money, say £10,000 a year, and the whole thing be left in her hands. To this last pro posal the reply was naturally a counter-question on the receipts of messages; but as an answer showing their intended disposal had not been prepared, the matterPOINTS OF DISCUSSION. 275 dropped. With regard to the non-employment of English officers, Colonel Goldsmid felt it his duty to combat such a notion in the most positive manner, and submitted to her Majesty's Minister his views on the subject in a memorandum to the following effect :— ' The experience of the last two years has shown the imprac ticability of working the Persian lines of telegraph in any way but under a system of organization such as acknowledged in Europe. To this end it has been proposed that a Convention be concluded with the Government of his Majesty the Shah, by which a second wire should be given to the existing line, ex clusively for Indian correspondence, under the superintendence of the engineer officers now engaged in working the single wire for twelve out of twenty-four hours. These officers and their establishment would, according to this convention, be retained for a fixed term, at the end of which it would be endeavoured to perfect the native telegraphers in their profession so as to act without extraneous aid. Should these terms not be accepted, it is not seen of what use would be any convention whatever, as the Persian line could not be looked upon as a sure link for Anglo-Indian communication. The undersigned would rather propose, in such case, that measures be at once taken to construct a second and alternative line in Asiatic Turkey, and to lay down a second cable to meet it.' Shortly after the occasion which called for this memo randum, one interview had a more than usually un favourable aspect. A position had been taken up wholly opposed to our monied interests in the telegraph. Little enough had been asked, and a great deal conceded in that respect, but the Minister was not satisfied. We had wished to buy, and lay out a lump sum : they were adverse to any arrangement taking the line of telegraph out of their own hands. We had proposed to treat on the basis of a wire of our own : the Persians t 2.1 fr &gt; V ; TELEdRAPH AND TRAVEL. would not hear ot such a. thing. Ihe wiie must be theirs, and all expense of attaching it theirs , conse quently, although we supplied the working establishment, the revenue was to be theirs equally. 1 he premises being changed, all subsequent action changed also. As for paying the establishment for their trouble, that was our affair; because the measure was ours, and only admis sible at our request! It might appear easy to reply that they could not work the line to advantage without us, but they said they could. Again, they would only have us for eighteen months, a period not worth the troublG of a Convention. Altogether issue had been joined on three important heads; traffic receipts, character of working establishment, limitation of period of agree ment ; and these were quite independent of less-defined controversy. One thing, moreover, had been omitted in the progress of negotiations. The golden key which opened all hard locks was disallowed. There was no 'clinking' music, as in Malcolm's days, to charm the Asiatic serpent of jealousy : immediate, solid, substantial, tangible benefit was nowhere; and in an atmosphere where promise was too frequently followed by evasion, the tone of British policy seemed to have changed, and not for 'the better. More than three months had passed, and the English officers had grown despondent at the slow progress made. Colonel Goldsmid had been twice with her Majesty's Minister to the King's presence ; had had business inter views with the Minister of i oreign Affairs, alone or accompanied by the Oriental Secretary of Legation, and had endeavoured, not apparently without fruit, to enlist the sympathy and support of influential European or native official residents in the cause advocated, butV J ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT. 27 7 negotiations seemed to hang fire. Suddenly there was a great commotion in the diplomatic world at Tehran about seats at the racecourse; and little as the telegraph could have to do with the matter, strangely enouirh, the matter seemed to have a direct affinity with the tele graph. For so it was, that while striving to appease the naturally aroused wrath of her Majesty's Minister at an offensive act laid to the charge of a high Persian dignitary, the responsible authorities took occasion to consider favourably certain references which had hereto fore been put aside. Among these was the draft Persian Telegraph Convention, which, having been argued into definite shape and substance, only required the Shahs assent and the signatures of the respective Plenipoten tiaries to be forwarded home for ratification. The Convention was of nineteen Articles, of which the four first were as follows. The Persian Government agreed to attach a second wire to the poles before erec ted between Bushahr and Khanikin ; the work to be done under the direction of an English officer and staff; the wire, 200 new posts, insulators, and instruments to be supplied by the British Government at a reasonable cost, recoverable in five years. The Persian Government further agreed that an English telegraph officer and staff, not exceeding fifty persons, exclusive of families, should be engaged for five years from opening communica tions through second wire, in organizing the line and giving instruction in telegraphy. At the conclusion of the specified period his connection with the work would cease, and the line be made over to the Persians. The Fifth Article defined'the control of the English irector, in especial relation to that of the Minister of cience, who was ' to be considered the head and ab-278 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. solute chief of all the Persian Government telegraphs/' and who would appoint officers, responsible to himself, for the protection of the line. The Sixth Article pro vided that 44 in filling up vacancies among the signallers, preference should be given by the English officer to natives of Persia,' if held qualified to perform the duties required. The Seventh Article pledged the Per sian Government to ' build a new office adjoining the existing one ' wherever there were not ' separate rooms. The Eighth provided for the use of the first wire in case of injury to the second, and vice versd. The Ninth regulated the rate between Khanikin and Bushahr at four teen shillings, with proportionate rates for the intervening towns. The Tenth credited the yearly receipts to Persia up to 30,000 tomans (12,000/.), any surplus to be 'made over to the officers of the English Government for the cost of their establishment.' The Eleventh gave all Indian messages to the second wire. The Twelfth secured the use of the first wire in the event of ex cessive traffic on the first. Of the remaining Articles, the Sixteenth accepted the terms of the Paris Telegraph Congress of 1865, 4 ' so far as not opposed to the terms' then agreed on, or to the institutions of Persia;' and the Eighteenth limited the period of the Convention to five years from the date of despatch of first telegram by the second wire. The remainder call for no separate notice. On completion of the telegraph negotiations at Tehran, the Chief Director saw no reason to remain any longer in Persia. Major Champain would attend to the clue despatch of aU materials required from home for the second wire, and engineer officers would be in waiting to receive them, commencing and completing their workv.] PROJECTED LAND-LINE THROUGH YE ZD. 279 as early as possible. He himself would proceed to India, reporting proceedings to the Bombay Govern ment, unclei whose orders the telegraph was immediately placed, subject to a general supervision of the Supreme Government. After visiting the Presidency towns and conferring with the respective Chambers of Commerce, lie would be guided by circumstances as to further movements. A congratulatory telegram from Sir Bartle Frere had contained instructions to Colonel Goldsmid to use his own discretion as to route in coming to Bombay, especially if he could do anything to promote branch line of telegraph to meet the already constructed English line in Makran : and the receipt of this authority was immediately acknowledged in the following terms : ' Major Smith 1 and I start for Ispahan on Saturday, ilience we propose to go together to Karman, which we may reach about New Year. Should all be well there, Smith takes Bandar Abbas, and I the Bampur route to Gwadar ... We hope to reach Bombay in March, Major Smith awaiting stores there for new Persian wire.' Lieutenant St. John remains in charge of Persian line during Smith's absence, taking all urgent reports in tended for me till my arrival at Gwadar notified.' ie ^ act that the question of a whole land-line, that is, a line uniting Ispahan with Gwadar by Yezd' Karman, Bandar Abbas and the coast; perhaps by Yezd, Karman, Bampur, and the valleys or river beds leading seaward; had been broached at Tehran, and was under consideration, at least of the authorities in India.

Her Majesty's Minister having further placed on official record his approval of the project, 1 Colonel Goldsmid and Major Smith started on their expedition under fair auspices. The programme was carried out much in the order laid down. The two officers parted a few stages east of Karman, and after three weeks' separate wandering, met again at the fishing village of Charbar, whence they steamed along the coast to Gwadar, and continued by sea to Karachi. The narrative of this journey belongs to another place, as do the subsequent rapid movements to Bombay, Baipur, Madras, C alcutta, Simla, Multan, Karachi, and Bombay again. But the results in relation to the telegraph should be recorded in the present chapter. The Chief Director, in submitting to the Bombay Government his own and Major Murdoch Smith's re port on the country they had traversed, thus expressed his views of the feasibility of constructing the line contemplated, according to the state of each separate section ; 1 In a letter, dated December 2, 1865 : ' I think it advisable that you should follow and examine the line of country between this and Gwadar best adapted for the construction of a new Persian land-line. ... I do no believe that there is any danger in this journey, if you appear open y in your character of British officer.''v.] REPORT OF CHIEF DIRECTOR. 281 ' 1'rom Ispahan to Karman, a distance of 434 miles, there is nothing which can be held physically obstructive to setting up telegraph posts. The measure would be costly, because there is no wood available on this line; and it would be necessary to obtain the co-operation of the executive, as well as the consent of the head-quarter Government of Persia. But with funds available and authority to treat, I should have little doubt of the removal of other difficulties. . . Politically, it could not be otherwise than a mutual benefit to her Majesty's Government and the Shah, to admit the merchants of Eastern Persia to an intercommunication, the frequency and rapidity of which must serve to develop trade and strengthen the bands of friendship. ' There are at this moment about 4,500 Parsis at Yezd and Karman, and at Yezd 1,500 Jews. The Hindus of Shikarpur, although few in number, have a nucleus at either place sufficient to become a notable element of trade if duly fostered. At present, Jews, Parsis, and Hindus are labouring under the dis advantages which more or less attend all such persons in Muhammadan countries. I do not pretend to say that the tele graph would be a direct means of amelioration of their state; that it would make the Muslim debtor more punctual in the discharge of his debts, or the Muslim ruler more chary of im posing the Capitation Tax. But it is a wedge, and applied in the right direction. The Muhammadans themselves, in these parts, have already benefited by their proximity to British India. Those who have travelled thither, are men of much apparent intelligence and freedom from prejudice. The mercantile class is not a small one, and is very influential; but although they in some degree appreciate the advantages which would accrue to them from the telegraph, they are unable to come openly forward in its favour so long as the priests and officials of Government are not with them. My advice to the Masalman merchants was to address the Shah by petition .... From Karman to the sea, there are physical obstacles to be overcome, of which we know sufficiently to make it premature to fix at this moment the precise direction for a line. At the282 TELEGRAFll AND TRAVEL. [chap. same time, I have no doubt whatever, that if Government be willing to press the measure, a junction could be effected at Bandar Abbas, by a route more favourable to its erection and maintenance, than that taken by Major Smith under the au spices of the Wakil-ul-Mulk. This route is the one frequented in winter. That used by the kafilas in summer is shorter, if not otherwise preferable. ' Reports on the feasibility of erecting a coast line of tele graph between Bandar Abbas and Gwadar have already, it is believed, heen laid hefore Government 5 and I have never heard that any difficulties had presented themselves to the scheme. Mr. Johnston has now reported on his and Major Smith's route from Jask to Suraf near the Sadich river. From the Tenk river to Charbar I myself came near enough to the coast to estimate its general features. I was at Gwettar more than two years ago, and on that occasion sailed, close in to the shore, from Charbar to Gwadar. Still, it is true that even now there has been no complete survey, as in the case of the Gwadar and Karachi line. I do not, however, think that moie is necessai^ to be done in this respect. No part of the section can be re garded as a tcvTd incofjnitci. Physical obstacles alone intervening, we might commence operations without delay. ' The upper route from Karman, by Bam and Bampur, to the coast at Gwadar, though shorter and more direct than by Bandar Abbas, is objectionable from two causes : 1st. The extensive tract covered by barren rocks, and intersected by mountain streams, for the first half of the road between Eegan and Bampur: and the passes into Makran, which present long difficult lines of access to the sea-shore, are physical obstacles which it would be well to avoid. 2nd. The want of water and shelter, especially in the hot, dry season, for distances which could scarcely be accom plished in a single day. 'But the difficulties are not insuperable, or indeed so formi dable as those which have already been overcome in Eastern Makran. And rather than not see carried out the alternative land-line, I would propose adoption of the road taken by myself as far as Kalanzao, and thence the caravan track direct to thev.] ROUTES FROM KARMAN TO SEA-COAST. 283 Fanoch pass, meeting my road again, and keeping it to Charbar . . Were the question a purely political one, the proper course would be to take the line up the Kej district of Kalat to Sarbaz, where it would fall into Persian territory more imme diately under the surveillance of Bampur, than any part of the coast. As our dealings in the matter must chielly be with Persia, our greater security would naturally be found in those parts, where her Government is more settled and less affected by local revolutions.' Major Murdoch Smith, in recording his opinion, that between Ispahan and Karman 'there would be no difficulty whatever' in setting up a line of telegraph, added : ' From Karman to Bandar Abbas, via Jiruft, the construction and maintenance of a line would be much more difficult. The mountain passes of Deh Bakri and Navargu offer many ob stacles, and the difficulty of maintaining a line in the sparsely- populated plains would be considerable, especially in the sum mer, when the heat is excessive. Another objection to this road is, that although at present tranquil and safe under the strong rule of the Wakil-ul-Mulk, it might not continue to be so under his successor, the majority of the population between Jiruft and the lower plains being Baluchis. The distance too, 380 miles, is great. These difficulties are probably not insuperable, but I think, that in the event of the project of a line of telegraph being entertained, the other and more direct road from Bandar Abbas to Karman should be examined. Although the moun tains near Karman w r ere impassable on account of snow when I came by Jiruft, I was told that the length of road thus blocked up was not greater than 15 or 20 miles. If, therefore, this road should prove preferable in other respects, I think the difficulty of the snow might be got over by making that portion of the line of very strong steel wir6 slightly stretched on short, stout posts. The signals would pass perfectly well as long as the wire was unbroken, even if it should be buried in the snow.284 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. ' But there is still another road, and one that would most naturally suggest itself to any one simply looking at the map, viz., the direct route from Bandar Abbas to Shiraz. The objections to this route are, that part of the intervening country is said to be half independent and generally in a disturbed state, and secondly, that the Persian Government would not care to have a line that only added so insignificant a place as Bandar Abbas to the towns in Persia already in telegraphic communication with the capital. This road, however, should also, I think, be examined before a decision is come to as to the precise route to be followed. ' At present, I am inclined to believe that the best of the three is the direct road from Bandar Abbas to Karman, es pecially as it must be 80 or 100 miles shorter than the other by Jiruft. And if proper measures were taken for guarding and patrolling the line, I believe there would be no physical diffi culty in the way that could not be overcome.' Mr. Johnston's brief but interesting report was chiefly of a political nature, or with reference to the inhabitants of the Makran coast: but he brought to notice no physical difficulties of any consequence to the construction of a telegraph line there. At Simla the Chief Director had the honour of person ally stating his views to their Excellencies the Viceroy and the Commander-in-Cliief, and to other members of Government. Returning to Bombay, he wrote a brief report of proceedings, and addressed a letter to the Secretariat urging prosecution of the scheme to connect Gwadar with Ispahan by an alternative land line. Not many days later he re-embarked for Europe, and soon after arrival in London, was called upon to report upon a communication addressed to her Majesty's Secretary of State for India by the Viceroy in Council. The despatch in question adverted to a memorandumv.] OPINION OF GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. 285 submitted by Colonel Goldsmid in Simla, in anticipation of more detailed reports and proposals. The narrative of the recently-performed journey had not at this parti cular time been received from Bombay, and Major Smiths original and carefully-prepared map of the country traversed had been stolen, if not accidentally lost, some where between Delhi and Ambala : so that it had been imperative to put a case more or less from simple memory as to data. 1 he Government of India had expressed an opinion that good reasons had been advanced l or believing that an alternative line of telegraph connecting Gwadar and Ispahan (or Shiraz) would be of great value. At present,' they continued, 'the security of the Indo-European communication depends solely on the single line of submarine cdble between Gwadar and Bushanr. If that cable gives way or is seriously damaged (and it is very liable to such damage), communication with Europe by telegraph must cease for a time, as was the case in 18()5. Ihe subject is one in which the English commercial public, and the Indian commercial public, and the two countries generally, have an equal and deep interest! • . . On the whole, the recommendations seem . . to be deserving of support, and we would suggest that the proposal be taken into . . eaily consideration, in the view to the opening of negotiations with the Persian Government, and the attainment of the assent of her Majesty's Government to share the expense of the pro posed operations.' Hie reply to this reference contained a short resume of events which had led up to the then posture of affairs, telegraphically and politically, on the Makran coast. A bulky appendix accompanied in illustration. Attention was called to the circumstance that the Bombay Govern ment had written as favoilrably of the Director's pro posals as the Supreme Government; and the two pen ultimate paragraphs may be quoted in full:286 telegraph and travel. [chap. 'As regards tlie advisfibility of ttiking the line liom l&gt;a.ndcir Abbas to Ispahan in lien of Shiraz, or (by the coast) to T.ushalir, late letters from Persia give me more forcible arguments than any hitherto adduced. The experience of one severe winter has shown that in that country alternative lines to the coast are of material importance to maintain unbroken communications. The last paper in the appendix contains copies and extracts of letters from Lieutenant St. John, R.E., to which attention is respectfully invited. It is not that recent failure in the working of the Persian lines has in any way shaken the confidence entertained in their ultimate efficiency under the new Convention, but that there are occasions arising from the climate and natural features of a country which should render every available precaution especially necessary. ' It might be premature in this place to enter more minutely into the details of the proposed Convention and cost of the line to the British Government. But should the liight Honourable the Secretary of State take the same view of the case as the Governments of India and Bombay, and authorize the submission of draft articles and terms in extenso, I would do myself the honour of drawing up a detailed paper on the subject, with a view to early negotiations at the Court of lehran. On receiving ci copy of the letter last cjuotetl, and in transmitting it to the Supreme Government, the Governor of Bombay in Council was pleased 2 to express his entire concurrence in the view therein expressed. Meanwhile the Secretary of State had received from Colonel Gold- smid in London the heads of a proposed Convention with the Persian Government, and sent them to the Foreign Office with a suggestion that, if her Majesty's foreign Secretary approved, the Envoy at Tehran 'should be i To the Under Secretary of State, No. 126 of 1866 ; copy forwarded to Government of Bombay with Col.

The cost of subsidies to chiefs and for protection, added to English establishments between Gwadar and Bandar Abbas, was estimated at G00/. per annum. 2 The Foreign Office, acting on the India Office suggestion, addressed their Minister in Persia on the subject, and all requisite preliminaries having been disposed of, Colonel Goldsmid received his final instructions and left London on his second mission to Tehran about the middle of October, 1866. He had at first proposed a rapid journey to his destina tion ; but delays occurred between London and Constan tinople. Major Champain had joined him in Paris, and proceeded thence direct to Berlin, while he himself took the lower route to Vienna. The purport of visiting these cities at this period will be clearer when we summarize the proceedings to improve telegraphic communications generally on the European lines used for ordinary Indian correspondence. Vienna was, it is true, strictly on the shortest route to Constantinople : but what with business interviews and official correspondence, five days were occupied, where one day would have amply sufficed in the mere course of travel. At Constantinople the work to be done, principally arising out of the five days at Vienna, kept the Chief Director nearly two months. It 1 September 6, 18CG. 2 No. 144, of August 29, 1866.288 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. was indeed most disheartening to find that nearly two years had passed since the Indo-Ottoman Telegraph had been opened, and yet messages were being despatched from the Pera offices to India which had been ' more than ten days on their way from London!' Upwards of 25,000 messages had passed through the said office during the nine months of 1866, for which a computation had been made showing an average of nearly 2,800 per mensem, and not very far from 100 per diem. Moderate as this amount would seem, the figures must have been far higher, had the working been more rapid and regular. The irregularity was perhaps a worse feature than the slowness. For, in a statement of seven months intercommunication, it was shown that only during one month (February) a message had failed to come ' directly,' that is with a mere flash, from Karachi to Constantinople, and not a single month had passed without illustration of like instantaneous working, for messages going from Constantinople to Karachi: and the average of this seven months was one day and nine hours for telegrams reach ing Constantinople from Karachi, and not twenty hours the other way. We shall soon have to revert to the Constantinople correspondence at this period, and until the new year dawned ; explaining as it does, the continuous or chronic phases of perplexity through which the Govern ment telegraph to India passed while following the material route first indicated by policy and the crows flight. For the present it will be well to resume the thread of the Persian story, till an exit from its mazes be obtained.

The instances which might be cited in testimony of this asser tion would not, perhaps, be surprising to those who know the Levant and its foreign diplomatists ; but, as many readeis of these pages may not possess that acquaintance, and merely look upon the representatives of her Majesty as distinguished officers fulfilling important functions in a certain conventional manner, there can be no violation of propriety in stating, on the best authority, that to Lord Lyons the public is indebted for active and practical aid in the advancement of telegraphic communication with India, which could not but bear fruit, and which did have a highly beneficial result. 1 Colonel Goldsmid embarked at Constantinople on the 5th of January, and landing at Poti, pursued his journey to the Russian frontier through Tiflis and Erivan. He was accompanied by Mr. Charles Wills, a young medical practitioner of ability, and passed M.B,, who was content, on fcii from lucrative terms, to try his fortunes in the new but limited sphere which had opened out, under Government, amongst the English telegraphers in Persia.

[chap. submitted to and approved by the Indian and Home Governments, were unsuccessful at the Court of Persia, is hardly to give a true representation of the case, much less to do justice to those Avho were the main instruments in endeavouring to bring about a realization of the scheme contemplated. The three months ventilation of the mea sure during the Chief Director's stay were not by any means thrown away, and proved nothing more or less than the prelude to negotiations re-opened by her Ma jesty's Minister a few months after Colonel Goldsmid's departure, which terminated in a Convention for the land line from Gwadar to Jask, and laying a' second, or alter native cable, between Jask and Bushahr. But the whole affair looked unpromising from the moment of Colonel Goldsmid's arrival at Tehran and throughout his sojourn there. The Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs would venture nothing in the way of examining details, fearing to commit himself to acceptance of a basis of any kind : the British Legation had little to say on a matter ex ceptional and extraneous, as it were, in its bearings an interest, and to a great extent in its origin and growth : friends, well capable of giving sound opinions and prophe sying prospective good results, augured unfavourably o immediate success ; and the Shah was about proceeding on a, to him, novel and important pilgimage to Mashhad, an event which of itself w T ould at once postpone con sideration of all diplomatic questions whatever. On the 16th April Mr. Alison officially notified to Colonel Goldsmid that after repeatedly pressing the new proposals respecting the telegraph on the attention o t ^ Persian Government, he had just received the Shahs final answer that he could not at present entertain them, and that, owing to his Majesty's early departure orv.j POSTPONEMENT OF DUPLICATE LINE. 291 Mashhad, he did not consider anything further could then be done in the matter. This result had been anticipated more than a month before, and a report on the subject addressed to the Bombay Government on the 11th March. A\ ith that report was submitted the copy of written communications made by Colonel Goldsmid to her Majesty's Minister since last arrival in Tehran, and the Director's proposals for future procedure : ' Though it were useless to conceal,' he wrote, ' the disap pointment experienced at this indefinite postponement of a project which, however extensive, was, I am convinced, practical and possible, I would yet respectfully invite the attention of Government to the advisability ot pressing a revival of the question at a more convenient opportunity. . . I confess to miss my way to a practical measure for strengthening the Gulf sec tion of the telegraph as effectual as that of utilizing the barren coast of Makran for a land-line up to Jask, or a more convenient point in the vicinity.' Illustration of the position, politically, geographically, and as it affected the telegraph, was then given, and the said extension to Jask, or a point some 400 miles west of Gwadar, mainly dwelt on. In a memorandum of interview held with the Persian Foreign Minister on the 4th March, forming one of the enclosures noted, it was shown that no real cause had been assigned to the writer for refusing to negotiate the proposal on the Makran coast-line ; while the counter- statement, of the trouble and cost of keeping up a long line through Eastern Persia, was undoubtedly with out foundation in reliable data. His Excellency the Governor of Bombay recorded a minute 1 on these papers, expressing his own opinion that 1 Dated May 4, 1867. u 2 • 11 i ' 1292 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [t'HAP. while the result of the Tehran negotiations was to be regretted, on account of the importance of securing im proved communications with Europe, attention should rather be given to securing an entirely separate line by the Red Sea, than to a coast extension of lines to the westward of Gwadar into Persian territory : and, re- ferring to interviews he had had with the Pasha of Egypt, as with Nubar and Rashid Pashas, he suggested that such a telegraph was quite feasible, and might be considered in respect of cost by both the Indian and home Governments. A generally concurring minute by Mr. Ellis was at the same time in favour of continued exertions to secure an alternative land-line. The matter was eventually referred to the Government of India, who ruled, that if the Government of Bombay were 'in favour of the extension of a land-line from Gwadar along the coast, as suggested by Colonel Goldsmid, and its continuance by another submarine cable to Bushahr, the probable cost of such a line, including payments to the local chiefs through whose territories the line would pass, should be ascertained.' 1 Having entered the phase of figures, the modified scheme may be said to have attained an advanced stage of progress; but out of India it was making way more rapidly still, as will be directly made apparent. Fulfilment of the Chief Director's home instructions to continue his journey to Baluchistan, and negotiate with the chiefs there, on completion of the proposed Convention, had met with a determined, however temporary check; so he had contemplated returning to head-quarters in London, and awaiting the close of the hot weather to 1 Secretary to the Government of India to Secretary to Government of Bombay ; No. 2,614 of Jnly 22, 1867.v.] TEHRAN TO BdMflAi' VIA BAGHDAD. 2 U3 proceed to India, trusting to the intervening time to put things on a better footing. But owing to a call by tele gram from Bombay, he was obliged to change his plans and turn his face at once towards the far East. A sharp nde post, for eight successive days, brought him to Baghdad, whence the river steamer conveyed him to the sea steamer, and after a fair passage for the little pro- pitious season, he reached Bombay, and shortly after wards Punah, the last in about a month from leaving Tehran. 0 After personal conference with Sir Seymour Fitzgerald on the state and prospects of the lines under his charge, Colonel Goldsmid took occasion of this earlier than in- tended visit to the Western Presidency, to submit a written account of his later proceedings, in continua- tion of one dated Tehran, about nineteen months before. usion to both these reports will be made hereafter : or the present, it need only be stated that the writer re-embarked at Bombay, on 9th July, to steam through •d monsoon-stirred sea to Socotra ; thence to reach London again on the 5th of August.

Lord Stanley, without delay, in structed lier Majesty's Minister at leliran to the desired effect. 1 Three months had not elapsed, when the India Office were informed by the Foreign Office that the Persian Government had re-opened negotiations on the matter of the coast telegraph, and a question of detail was put, clearly proving the whole case to be under actual discussion. Early in April, after exchange of many telegrams between London and 1 ehran, and nu merous transaulic references south of Downing Street, the conclusion of a brief Convention in the following terms was notified by telegraph : — '1. In order to provide against any accident to the Persian Gulf cable, it is agreed that the British Government shall make arrangements in regard to the construction and efficient working of a line of telegraph between Gwadar and a point between Jask and Bandar Abbas. ' 2. The Persian Government will employ its good offices and authority for facilitating its construction, maintenance, and protection ; and the English Government will pay annually to the Persian Government the sum of 3,000 tomans, for leave to lay down a line of telegraph on those parts of coasts and places which are under the sovereignty of Persia, the payment of the above sum being made from the day upon which the work of laying the wire is commenced. ' 3. The present Convention to remain in force for twenty years.' The memorandum which had been forwarded by the India Office as a basis for the renewal ot negotiations at Tehran had recited the proceedings of the Bombay Government on the receipt of Colonel Goldsmids report of the 11th March; but dwelt mainly on the political considerations therein comprised. With reference to these, 1 Sept. 3 ; Mr. Hammond to Under Secretary of State, India Office.v.] PROPOSITION FOR COAST LINE. 295 it had been suggested to put into the Envoy's hands a proposition which, if acceptable to Persia, might obviate the necessity of adopting any course affecting, or supposed to afiect, her interests, without her consent and participation. 1 lie proposition was thus expressed :— ' We pay now, according to official statement for the year 1866, the sum of Ks. 42,3/1 per annum, for maintenance of our land-line of telegraph from Karachi to Gwadar. Of this 21,000 is subsidy to chiefs. It miglit be reckoned that at least a similar sum would be required, were we to construct a land-line, as proposed, from Gwadar westward to a point between Jask and Bandar Abbas. At the present exchange, 10,000 tomans is the equivalent of Es. 40,000. Half of this might . . be set aside for Persian territory, and half for territory in which Persia has no acknow ledged jurisdiction. 'A sum of 3,000 tomans (Es. 12,000) yearly to Persia, to allow us to treat with the Shaikh of Bandar Abbas, and any other chiefs on the coast of Baluchistan over whom she may assert control, would, it is believed, be acceptable ; and while we, on our part, give a guarantee of non-interference with political pre tensions, we might reasonably expect a similar guarantee, in return, of non-interference in telegraph arrangements, so far as the whole line is concerned.' ihe division of Rs. 40,000 was then roughly shown : Subsidy to Kalat and Makran chiefs . .

[chap. As might not unnaturally be expected, some modification was found necessary in practice. After attending the International Telegraphic Con ference at Vienna in 1868, Colonel Goldsmid again set out for India, and entered upon the task of subsidizing the chiefs. His proceedings may be briefly narrated. The mission with which, on this occasion, he was charged was twofold. He had to prepare the way, politically, for the coming posts and wires along the barren and little-known coast between Gwadar and Jask: and to make a searching examination of telegraph ex penditure, with a view to reduction and systematizing. Leaving London with the night mail of the 16tli October, and embarking at Marseilles early on the 18th, he landed at Bombay on the 7th November. A few days at the Presidency were passed in preliminary arrange ments and general official work; but by the end of the month, Karachi, Gwadar, Charbar, Sadich (a point near the old Perso-Kalat boundary), Jask and Maskat had been visited, and he was back at the first of these places on return to Bombay. December was little less peripatetic than the month preceding, for in it he journeyed vid Nagpur to Calcutta, returning to Bombay at Christmas. In the former city he had the honour of personally reporting to the going Viceroy ; in the latter, of paying his respects to the coming Viceroy. The month of January was busily spent in Bombay. On the 1st February he again embarked for Karachi; on the 8th idem, he re-embarked in Karachi in the tele graph steamer AmherwitcJi, for Gwadar. From Gwadar he moved by land to Charbar, in company with Captain Ross, Political Agent on the coast, performing this short but somewhat eventful journey in eight marches andv.] PBOCEEDINGS IN MAKE AN AND BOMBAY. 297 nine days. Returning to the telegraph steamer at Char- bui, they landed at Jask to negotiate on the 24th February. Here Captain Ross remained behind ; and Colonel Goldsmid, with lieutenant Stiffe, IN., pro ceeded to inspect the neighbouring island of Hen jam, returning for Captain Ross on the 3rd March. The next clay they anchored oti Charbar, where a Darbar was held and much work done, and on the 6th March they re turned to Gwadar. On the 7th Colonel Groldsmid, sepa rating from Captain Ross, steamed back to Karachi; and on the 12th idem he was again in Bombay. From'that date until embarkation for Suez on the 1st May, he remained at the Presidency, engaged in unravelling the knotty question of telegraph accounts and summarizing, under instructions, the political history of the Makran coast. To assist in the former work, Mr. Kellner, the well- known accountant, now Military Accountant-General m India, had been specially deputed from Calcutta to Bombay; Captain Pierson, R.E., had been despatched fiom -loinan , and the Accountant-General in Bombay had been, moreover, associated with Colonel Goldsmid and his colleagues, in the capacity of President of Com mittee. The other business was of urgent nature, and the case demanded study and appreciation, not alone with reference to the future security of the telegraph, but for the guidance of our political relations generally in the regions through which the lines might be required to pass. Instead of dwelling, in this part of the narrative, upon the negotiations with the Baluch or other chiefs on the coast, or showing how each agreement was signed and rought about, it may be simply stated that a resolution o the Bombay Government of the 8th June, 1869, conveyed the entire approval of his Excellency in Council298 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. to all Colonel Goldsmids proceedings. The latter officer, on completing his work in Bombay, returned home, ac companied to Constantinople by Captain 1 ierson and Mr. Kellner. But in connection with the land-line proposals, a really important operation was successfully carried out at the beginning of this year, which must not be passed over in silence. For a long time the trying climate and isolated position of the station at Masandam had at tracted the attention of the telegraph authorities ; and after a lengthened correspondence with Government, 1 and many references on the political as well as sanitaiy aspects of the question, it was resolved to transfer the cable from the Arabian side of the Gulf to Jask, and open out a new station in the island of Henjam. For the quiet and ready manner in which this change was efiected, gieat credit is due to Mr. Walton's general superintendence, and Lieutenant Stiffe's careful and skilful execution. The report of the Director, Makran Coast and Sub marine Telegraph, to the Chief Director, describing these proceedings and his own arrangements for the proposed new stations at Charbar and Jask, is dated the 19th December, 1868. That all was not couleur de rose may be inferred from the following extracts ' Owing to prevalence of fever at Gwadar, I had already used that station as one of observation only, thus throwing all the work on Masandam, and causing some delay in the transmission 1 1865—69. Major Cham pain had reached Bombay on the 26th November, 1867, with instructions to carry out the transfer of the cable to Henjam, and establish a station there ; but the measure was delayed with a view to the further discussion of preliminaries, the disposal of which was, politically, essential. More than a year had elapsed from the above ' a e when the work was actually completed.If II v.] MR. WALTON'S REPORT. 299 of messages. Finding that the health of the station did not improve, I left the Assistant Superintendent and two clerks only, intending to remove them also if they succumbed to the fever. I was obliged to remove the apothecary, as he was too ill to attend to his duties. This state of affairs rendered it important that a station should be opened at Jask at the earliest moment ' The village of Jask is some five or six miles from the landing place, and I did not see the Naib. . .His brother, and others whom he sent to me, reiterated the assurance that we shall have every assistance from them; that they had been instructed from Maskat we were coming, and that we should choose our sites for building on. As usual, these people assured me that camels could be obtained to any number, that sheep and fowls were always procurable, and that we had only to ask for whatever we wanted and it would be supplied. The truth is that not a camel, sheep, or fowl is procurable at Jask, but it seems to be the cus tomary etiquette all along the coast to assure one that the country abounds with every requisite for travelling, whereas it is just the contrary ; and, except for a very few animals at a time, even water and fodder are not obtainable.' 1 The Director's letter may be further quoted :— ' Meeting Lieutenant Stiffe at Jask, the shore ends were landed, and the deep-sea cables on both circuits were joined on to them ; and so efficiently was this duty conducted by that officer, that an interruption of only nine and a half hours resulted Irom the operation. An arrangement was, at the same time, made for the abandonment of the Masandam station and the removal of the clerks to Jask, simultaneously with the cutting out of the old cable, and the joining up the diversion by w T ay of Henjam.' 1 The remedy, if still required, is very simple, but needs official authoriza tion. We should open friendly communications with Anguran, the capital of Bashakird, and the interior, through the legitimate channels. The annexation to Persia of the province of Bashakird was formally notitied in the Tehran Gazette of May 29, 1862. v* L300 TELEGBAFN AND TRAVEL. [chap. Mr. Walton took the teak wood-house which had been in use at Masandam across to the island of Henjam, where it was to be re-erected on a stone plinth, constructed under the orders of the Government Engineer Officers detached for the occasion. The Amhcnvitch arrived with the cable true to her time, and such temporary arrangements as could be made for working the line, pending the opening of a regular station, were at once carried out. AVe continue the Directors own account:— ' Having arranged with Lieutenant Stiffe the time at which he would cut the Masandam Station out of circuit on the Busiiahr side near Tunib Island; and also when he could join over the new cable near Kuhi Mubarak, thus bringing Jask and Bushahr into communication byway of Henjam, I left for Masandam, and at once began to dismantle the place, and ship everything be longing to ns that was on the island, so as to be ready to start for Jask as soon as we found that the Amberwitch had grappled the cable off the great Tiimb. This occurred on the evening of the 9th instant: and by noon of the 11th, Jask was in good communication with Bushahr through the new diversion, and I had landed sufficient clerks and requisites of every description to enable Jask to begin work at once as the central repeating station on the lino. ' I consider that very great credit is due to Lieutenant Stiffe and Mr. Hirz, for the precision and exactitude with which the arrangements for picking up the old cable, and joining on the new, were carried out. I believe that no similar operation has ever been done in so short a time. It involved the grappling for and picking up and joining on the Masandam cable in some forty fathoms of water, under-running it for several miles, and then picking up and joining on the new cable in the same depth. A similar operation was necessary off Kuhi Mubarak, a distance of nearly 120 miles from the former position off Tiimb Island, and yet it caused a delay to the traffic of only forty-five horns. 1 must also thank Captain Tolputt for the manner in which he enabled me to move about so rapidly, and so to carry out ni}v.] SUCCESSFUL DIVERSION OF CABLE. 301 arrangements, as to ensure the Masandam station being aban doned, and the Jask station fully established, while the diversion on the cable was being brought into circuit.' 1 Mr. Walton also commended Captain Carpendale, LN., for services rendered in command of the Lord Elphinstone steamer. The Chief Director, in for warding the papers to the Secretariat, 2 took ' the oppor tunity of submitting to the notice of his Excellency the Governor in Council that the diversion of the cable from 4 through Masandam' to 4 through Henjam/ and transfer of the telegraph station to Jask,' were matters which had ' long occupied the time and attention of Government,' and that the successful accomplishment of both objects was 'a step of considerable importance.' He moreover stated ; ' I have informed the Director of my unqualified concurrence in the opinion expressed by him of the services rendered by Lieutenant Stiffe, LN., Mr. Hirz, and the other officers he has named ; and would respectfully add that Mr. Walton's own arrange ments appear to have been highly judicious, and carried out with the same zeal and energy which have charac terized his former labours in connection with the efficient maintenance of the line under his direction.' 3 In parting company, a few pages back, with Major Murdoch Smith, R.E., we purposed reverting, in chrono- ^ !

On the 4th September, 1866, Major Murdoch Smith reported to the Government of Bombay ' the arrange ments made for the erection and maintenance of the second wire of the Persian telegraph, from l^usliahr, vxd Tehran, to the Turkish frontier, according to the Con- vention of the 23rd November.' He had, immediately after his arrival at Tehran from India, explained verbally to the Persian Minister of Public Works, the measures that he hoped to see adopted by his Government, follow ing up the statement by a written memorandum. The want of any response to this procedure caused him to address Mr. Alison, who, failing to get satisfactory notice taken of the subject in the Foreign Department, desired Major Smith to call on the Foreign Minister with his Oriental Secretary. Assurances that all necessary orders w T ould be issued were made after the custom of the country, but it oozed out, in a separate channel, that funds from the royal or state revenues had been denied; and, as a natural consequence, the English Director was eventually requested to advance the requisite sums himself, re covering the amount expended from the future receipts of the traffic. The request was a strange one, considered in reference to the Persian arguments used when the Convention was under discussion ; but it was judgedv.] ARRIVAL OF STORES FOR SECOND WIRE. 303 expedient to humour it, and home sanction was solicited and obtained. So that, before Persia could move a step towards carrying out her self-imposed pledge to put up a second wire for the British Government, a kind of abnormal artide passed virtually though impalpably into the text of the treaty, whereby the expense and trans port of materials and erection of the wire was to be defrayed by her Majesty's Government in the first instance, the amount thus expended being recognized as a debt by the Persian Government to be' paid in instal ments or otherwise from the receipts of the International Traffic.' 1 The Hastings, with stores for the second wire, had arrived at Bushahr two days before the date of Major Smith's last quoted despatch. On the 5th September he wrote:— Every effort will be made to open communication on the double line as soon as possible, but I fear we shall be unable to complete the work before next spring.

Dry-rot and white ante had proved formidable foes ; and a large number of poles had already been replaced : for a great part of the line every pole had to be taken out and examined. There was great difficulty in getting beasts of burden, and in the province of Kara there had just been on epidemic among the mules. As ' no amount of pressure could induce ' the Persians to replace the decayed or useless poles he congratulated himself that the cost of moving was placed in his own hands. _ ' When the work is com pleted,' he writes in conclusion, ' and the 2,000 iroii poles added, which I understand are being sent out by her Majesty's Government, I am very sanguine of a satisfactory result.' On the 1st August, 1867, the Director forwarded to the Government of Bombay reports of his assistants. Lieu tenants St. John and Pierson, regarding the completion of the double line of telegraph from Bushahr to Tehran, and from Tehran to Karmansbah, respectively.

Prom December till March the most strenuous exertions failed to keep the line open for traffic, and it was not until the end of the latter month that regular working parties could be got together to repair effectually the damage wrought by the severity of the season, ' Immediately on the signature of the Convention, an estimate of new poles required had been submitted to the Persian Govern ment, and orders sent to the local authorities to furnish them without delay. 'In Shiraz I succeeded in persuading the Governor .. to give me the purchase-money for the 700 oak poles required about Kazarun, and they were accordingly cut and brought on the line during the winter. Pive hundred chinar poles I obtained in the same way at Shiraz, early in spring; but the rest of the poles, about 4,000 in number, were grudgingly supplied in tens and twenties during the summer, and on arrival of the Hastings, with the stores for the second wire, not a thousand had been collected, in addition to those above mentioned, over the whole distance from Bushahr to Tehran. This was the state of affairs when the arrangement was concluded with the Persian Govern ment placing the whole of the expenditure in our hands.

We have therefore freely adopted the latter course :— ' On the 2nd September the Hastings anchored at Bushahr.

With great trouble—caused first by the fear of the muleteers being forced to carry the telegraph stores as usual at a mere nominal hire, afterwards by an influx of imported goods to Bushahr which caused the merchants to raise the hire, and use every pos sible means to prevent my obtaining mules—the whole of the wire find stores were despatched from Bushahr before the end of the year. By the middle of January, none of the stores for the second and first divisions remained in Shiraz. ' Earlv in November, two working parties were started from Shiraz to prepare the old line for the reception of the second wire. This was done by digging up all the poles that appeared in any way unsound, replacing them, if unfit to be replanted, by new ones ; by attaching the insulators for the second wire to the poles, and by a careful examination and repair of the old wire. ' The first party, under Colour-Sergeant Bower, RE., worked from Shiraz to Murghab, and completed their task by the end of the year. The second, under Corporal Norman, E.E., prepared the line for the reception of the second wire from Murghab, to Abadeh, and arrived at that place early in January. 'About the end of November, Corporals Graves and Hamiltou were similarly employed between Ispahan and Abadeh, while Mr. Iloeltzer worked from Ispahan to Kashan, and Sergeant Isaacson from that place to Tehran, which last section you 1 had kindly taken charge of.

By the end of April, all parties in the third division had finished work, aud the second line was complete. Lieutenant Lovett, RE., had taken charge of the second division from the 1st of February, and the work of straining the second wire therein was carried out under his superin tendence. A few remarks descriptive of the line in the division under my charge may possibly be of interest. Leaving the town of Bushahr opposite the British Residency, the line is carried, on 300 iron standards of the * Siemens ' pattern, across the ' Mashilah' to the village Chahgodak. From this, 250 ' Hamilton' poles carry the wires to near Khushab, a point 27^ miles from Bushahr. 1 hence to the loot of the hills at Daliki the line is on the old poles, the first wire supported on insulators, the second simply nailed to the poles. This part of the line will be supported on the new standards of the ' Siemens' pattern now on their way from England, 'At Daliki the line enters the hills which form the barrier between the plateau of Iran and the low plain bordering the sea and here are the most formidable difficulties we have had to encounter. The original line from Daliki to the river of the same name, eight miles distant, was carried from ridge to rid-'e at a considerable distance from the road. This course, though presenting fewer engineering difficulties was found inconvenient from the impossibility of getting the line' guards to inspect it; and I therefore changed it for one in view o t e road, a most tedious and difficult work. From the Daliki nver the line was carried up the Kothal Main, a steep pass i.oUU feet in height, to the plain of Konartakhtah, 1,800 feet above the sea. A similar ascent leads to the valley of Kamarij, ' feet hl g her - Thence a rugged defile, the'Tang-i-Tarku,' rings the line to the plain of Kazarun, in the town of which name is the first telegraph station, 100 miles from Bushahr, and VUU feet above the sea.

Thronghout the hills from l.aliki to Dasht-i-arjan, the poles are of gall-nut oak, which, thonsh unsightly in appearance, are of more durable quality than any other wood I have seen in Persia. It is to be re -retted tint they are found in so limited a region only. 'The bulk of the poles from Dasht-i-arjan to Shiraz are of Oriental plane (chinar), which is superior in every respect to the poplar generally used. I have ohinar poles now seaj.i,,. at Shiraz to replace the few poplar poles remaining in this part of the line; and by November of this year there will not be a single poplar pole between Bushahr and Mnrehab a guarantee of security for five years at least. ' Crossing the plain of Mardasht from the river Bandamir past the rums of Persepolis and Istakhr, the line ascends to the' narrow valley of Polvar, from which it merges close to the tomb of Cyrus and the ruins of Pasargadae, on the plains of PehbW 8000 f T ^ ^ Sl0peS the l0% plateau of l)ehbid, 8,000 feet above the sea, which, though without engi- neenng difficulties, is one of the most troublesome portions of e me, from its intense cold in winter.

One district alone, that of Barazjfm, near Bushahr, has until the last two months been a source of constant annoyance, from the inveterate habit of insulator-breaking indulged in by its inhabitants, the most lawless tribe between Tehran and the sea. Remonstrances, warnings, and fines being of no avail, H.R.H. the Governor of Fars has at last been compelled to occupy the village with troops, as a guarantee for future good behaviour. Now that the line is placed in a thoroughly efficient state, and that the line-guards are entirely under our control, nothing is wanted to complete its security but the establishment of European signallers at each intermediate station .... At Kazarun an English signaller is already permanently stationed, and one will be shortly sent to Abadeh, and I hope that signallers may soon be spared for Dehbid and KQmishah, Kum, and Kashan. (■reat credit is due to H.R.H. the Hisam-u-Saltaneh for the admirable manner in which he has carried out the orders of the (rovernment ot lehran regarding the repair and fitting up of the Bushahr and Shiraz offices. At Bushahr the two offices, 1 ersian and English, are separated by a wide courtyard, are raised at least twenty feet from the ground, and open to the prevailing winds. I he English office has, moreover, a broad veranda11 on each side. It contains instrument office and signaller s room, besides large storerooms and accommodation for the inspector in charge of the section. The Shiraz office is fixed in one of the historic buildings of Shiraz, the Diwan Ivhanah of Ivarim Khan. Two-thirds of this fine building had fallen into ruins, the rest having been used as a joint office for the last year and a half. I succeeded in indu cing H.R.H. the Hisam-u-Saltaneh to put the whole in thorough repair, and have thus not only secured the best telegraph office in Persia, but had the satisfaction of arresting the decay of a building of historic interest. Xot its least recommendation, inv.l GOOD CONDUCT OF STAFF. 311 so turbulent a city as Shiraz, is its impregnability to assault in case of an emeute, an event always to be expected. ' \\ hile on this subject, 1 may mention that 1 experienced the greatest difihculty in finding suitable quarters for the telegraph staff in Shiraz, without scattering them over the town at incon venient distances from the office and from each other in case of a riot. With great trouble, and by paying exorbitant rents, I have obtained sufficient quarters in one parish to accommodate the whole staff for the present year, after which, either by owners refusing to repair, or raising their rents, I shall probably have to begin a search for quarters anew. ' H.R.H. the Hisam-u-Saltaneh, on my mentioning the sub ject to him, offered me a piece of waste ground close to the telegraph office, to build quarters for the whole staff, adding that it would be matter of great satisfaction to him to know that we were thus in safety in case of an emeute in the city. Such a building would cost 50,000 rupees at least, and could not be designed, estimated, and sanctioned before next winter, durin' which building operations are impossible ' Lieutenant St. John, remarking on the admirable conduct of the stafl under his orders, unci the necessity forced upon him of throwing upon his inspectors an unusual individual responsibility, in matters of construc tion, organization and account, brought prominently for ward the services of Mr. Ernest Hoeltzer, appointed an assistant-superintendent, commending his zeal, activity, and thorough knowledge of the particular tracts in which he was engaged. Colour-Sergeant David Bower had been, ' as always, most indefatigable/' The value of his services had been especially enhanced by 'his skill in construction and talent for organization.' Corporals Norman, Graves, Hamilton, MacDonald, MacGowan and Lapham, all of the Royal Engineers, were also lauded for good work and efficient aid ; and the names of Messrs. t! i lis312 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. Thompson, Peck, and Rnshton, in charge of offices, Mr. Constantine, superintending the despatch of stores, Corporal Kelly, R.E., in the account department, and Mirza Husain Ali Khan, the British agent at Shiraz, were mentioned with particular favour. Lieutenant St. John concluded with an expression of his best thanks 'to H.R.H. the Hisam-u-Saltaneh, Governor-General of Fars, for his unvarying courtesy and kindness on all occasions, and his anxiety to do all in his power to facilitate his work; and his obligations to Colonel Lewis Pelly, H.M. Resident at Bushahr, for his constant kindness and support.' Lieutenant Pierson's report is dated 20th July, 1867. In his division the second wire from Tehran to Hamadan had been completed and opened for traffic on the 28tli May ; and from Hamadan to Karmanshah on the 15th June. Pie had. himself been on a mission to Tiflis in the previous year, only returning to Tehran on the 25th September, or some three weeks after arrival of the stores at Bushahr. One month later he had quitted the capital to commence active operations. The first object to be attained was the renewal of all defective posts; the second, to get and properly distribute his materials, which had been sent up from Bushahr to Ispahan, and were thence despatched by the main road to Tehran or by cross road to Hamadan and Karmanshah. The mere difference of time taken up in the transport of stores from Bushahr would go far to account for the completion of the work in this division some five weeks later than in the other, though the distance is considerably less. The report of progress is no less interesting than that of the longer division, and copious extracts may be here appropriately given, with little exception, verbatim :—LIEUTENANT PIER SON'S REPORT. 313 ' I entrusted the charge of the work from Tehran to Zerra a section about 150 miles in length, to Corporal Hockey, R.E and gave him as assistant Corporal Peattie, E.E., lately arrived in the country. They commenced work on the 28th February bv which time all the insulators required for this section had reached Tehran, and had been distributed alon^ the road Start ing from Tehran they put the line into thorough repair, replacing 2.2 poles by new ones, and preparing it for the reception of the new w,re by the second insulator on each post. About 28 miles in all of the course of the line were altered, as expe rience had shown that certain parts of it became inaccessible in winter. Returning on the 81h May, Corporal Hockey strained np second wire and completed his portion of the work on the 28th May He deserves great credit for the satisfactory manner m which he accomplished his task. 'Prom Zerra to Karmanshah, a section of 150 miles, was in the charge of Corporal Fowles, RE. He commenced work at Hamad an on the 1st March, and completed the erection of the second wire as far as Zerra, about 50 miles, on the 17th The posts of the first 8 miles from Hamadan had to be entirely removed, and the course of the line altered, as it originally ran rough a series of vineyards and gardens that baffled all attempts at efficient inspection and maintenance. 175 new poles had been provided for this 50 miles, but were found insufficient. The wor' was not delayed on this account, but Corporal Fowles has about 200''f 8 *] ^ thlS P0rti0n ' and is now e Wd in renewing about 200 of the remaining posts. On the 19th March, starting a^am from Hamadan, he commenced working in the Karmanshah o^ffh fir f 4 mileS 0f thia Piece had also t0 be moved of the vineyards, and on the 5th April he had brought the second wire to the top of Asadabad Pass, 24 miles from Hamadan having renewed 70 of the old posts. Unfortunately Corporal' ow es at this time fell seriously ill, in consequence of his un- muting exertions while constantly exposed to the exceptionally '• ather he had met with during these operations. 11 hea i ri 'g of th e stoppage of the work caused by the illness veliev^hin, Tr 8 ' 1 ^ Colour - Ser g eant Chatti n, RE., to mi - This non-commissioned officer had come out in314 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. charge of the last detachment of Royal Engineers, and was con sequently new to the country; but the satisfactory manner in which he surmounted the difficulties incident to his slight knowledge of the Persian language and customs, more than justified me in the choice I had made of him. With him was Corporal Empson, also recently joined, who had been Corporal Fowles' assistant as well. On the 9th April they resumed work from the top of the pass, whence to Karmanshah is a distance of about 76 miles. No less than 600 new poles were used to repair this portion of the line ; all the old poles were taken up for examination, and reset when long enough after the decayed ends had been cut off. Wherever the line passed unavoidably through marshy ground, the posts were coated with bitumen from the foot to some height above the surface of the ground.... While the work was in progress opposite the village of Asada- bad, the inhabitants of that place, from some unaccountable motive, wantonly destroyed upwards of 100 of the insulators that had just been put up. I am glad to say that measures have been taken by the Persian Government for severely pun ishing the culprits. In the Sahna district again, the inhabitants of a small village near the road offered considerable opposition to the construction of the telegraph. It had been found neces sary to alter the course of the line at this particular place; and as the new direction adopted seemed objectionable to the villagers, they repeatedly destroyed at night all that had been done in the day. This practice was continued until the ring leaders were caught and punished. At another time, a Persian Prince, requiring some mules to enable him to go on a hunting expedition, seized those that were employed in bringing up poles and wire for the working party, and several days elapsed before he could be made to give them up again. These and other causes of delay prevented Colour-Sergeant Chattin from reaching Kar manshah until the 2nd of June, and even then he found himself short of insulators, so many having been wilfully destroyed during his progress from Hamadan. The last few miles of the wire could not, therefore, be put up until several loads of in sulators had been sent for and received from other parts of the country, and it was not until the loth June that the second wire could be reported completed from Hamadan to Karmanshah.LIEUTENANT PIERSON'S REPORT. 315 This working-party had met with several misadventures, but the climax had yet to be reached. On their way back to Ha- madan, from which place most of the labourers employed had been brought, they found half a mile of the line, at a pass called Bediswik, completely destroyed. While engaged in reconstruct ing it, a party of Kurds came down upon them, and after mal treating them, left them stripped and bound under the telegraph, carrying off everything they possessed—tools, clothes, and all their hard-earned gains of the last three months, which they had just been paid, and were taking home to their families. Fortu nately for the Englishmen, they were not present at the time, or they would have met with the same treatment. ' The work over the remaining section of my division, from Karmanshah to the Turkish frontier, a distance of 140 miles, I placed in the charge of Corporal Whittingback, R.E. The smallest number of new poles necessary to enable him to put this part of the line into good order was estimated at 1,500. As timber of any kind fit for telegraph purposes is very scarce and dear in that part of Kurdistan, I entered into an agreement with a Persian Shahzadah, the owner of extensive plantations in a remote district called Tusirkan, some 80 miles from Kar manshah. The trees, of a specified size, were to be cut down at once, it being the beginning of December, and left to season, until the approach of spring enabled them to be transported to Karmanshah. According to the custom of the country, the price agreed upon had to be paid in advance. Unfortunately I could spare none of the English staff to remain and watch the felling of the trees, the consequence of which was that, out of the 1,000 poles presented in the spring in the fulfilment of the contract, only about 400 could be accepted as coming up to the standard. The Shahzadah insisted that he had carried out his part of the agreement, and for a long time would not consent either to refund the price of the 1,100 rejected poles, or to supply others in their place. It was only after reporting him to the Persian Government at Tehran, who sent a Sarhang armed u ith special orders, that the Shahzadah was at length obliged to consent to replace the rejected poles by good ones. It was now 3' I anf l in -Tune, when these new poles were supplied, I could316 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. only accept some 150 of thein as at all fit for telegraph pur poses. Then, fairly wearied out, I refused to lose any more time in endeavouring to obtain proper poles from the Shahzadah in fulfilment of his contract, and have since remained engaged in attempting to recover the balance due to me of the money advanced to him. The above is but a bare outline of an episode that is a characteristic example of business procedures in Persia, and of the kind of minor difficulties with which the construction of a telegraph in this country is beset. During these transactions the Shahzadah once so far forgot himself as to have the telegraph munshi, whom I had sent to him with a message, severely beaten by his servants, who took advantage of the occasion also to rifle the munshi's pockets. On after- reflection the Shahzadah became frightened at what he had done; and this helped matters to some sort of a conclusion. ' Tn the meantime the work between Karmanshah and the frontier could not be commenced for want of poles. When I received information, however, that iron poles were on their way out from England, of which 800 were allotted to my division for use in the frontier section, there was no longer any reason for delaying the erection of the second wire over that portion of the line which would eventually be reconstructed with the iron posts, as the existing poles would support the double line sufficiently well during the approaching summer. 1 accordingly, on the 7th March, directed Corporal Whitting- back to put up the second wire from the frontier to Kirind, a distance of 7G miles. He commenced work at once, and had completed the portion in question by the end of March, but not without considerable difficulty, as the poles were so affected with rot at the foot that but few would support the ladder neces sarily placed against them to enable the workmen to fix on the second insulator. There now only remained the G4 miles from Kirind to Karmanshah to complete. As soon as it became doubtful whether the Shahzadah at Tusirkan would ever supply the poles he had engaged to deliver, and on which T had been obliged hitherto to rely, T began taking measures to procure them from other quarters, chiefly from villages near Hamadan,v.] COMMENDATION OF MEN AND MATERIALS. 317 and to send them to Karmanshah as fast as carriage could be obtained. In June a sufficient number of poles had reached Karmanshah to enable Corporal Whittingback to recommence work, and, under favourable conditions, a fortnight would have enabled him to fill up the gap of 64 miles that remained. The heat, however, had become so great that one batch of labourers after another deserted him, and could not be induced to remain on the work even by greatly increased rates of pay. It is worthy of remark that a Persian labourer, however poverty- stricken, refuses to be tempted, by any consideration, to work either in the great heats of summer or in the severe cold of winter. Added to this, the Kurds at this time discovered that the iron hooks of the new insulators could be turned to several useful purposes, and began a course of systematic breakage in order to supply themselves with these coveted prizes. The work consequently came to a practical standstill after some 20 miles had been put up, and, although there only remain 40 miles to be done, no date can be fixed for its com pletion with any approximation to certainty. As soon as the iron posts arrive, the part from the frontier to Kirind will be reconstructed with them ; as autumn will then have set in, but little time will be consumed in this. ... I cannot conclude my notice of this section without bringing prominently before you the zeal and energy that Corporal 'Whittingback has dis played under these peculiarly trying circumstances.' Lieutenant Pierson further commended his men and materials. The British agents at Karmanshah and Hamadan had shown readiness to aid ; the wire was of excellent; quality, and the insulators, though too heavy and of objectionable form, were very good. The tools were also good, but many were obtainable in the country 'of shapes more adapted for the use of the natives.' He concluded his report with a few practical remarks on the necessity of supplying the wanting means for future maintenance of the line, which could not be safely en-TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. trusted to purely Persian vigilance and provision; with pointing out the advantage of establishing a central office at the Turkish frontier ; and with an expression of his obligations to Sir Arnold Kemball, Political Agent at Baghdad, for help and support freely afforded ' in all matters connected with the telegraph.' In forwarding the reports, of which the substance has been for the most part recorded in the words of the writers themselves. Major Smith expatiated on the difficulties that had been overcome ; while on the subject of main tenance, dwelt upon by Lieutenant Pierson, he has him self much of interest to say :— ' It has to be borne in mind that the conditions of a line of 1,200 miles in a country like this, bear little resemblance to those of a line of similar extent in more civilized countries. The stations are necessarily far apart, with intervening tracts of pure desert. The climate, except in spring and autumn, is excessive, intense cold and heavy snow in winter, and great heat in summer. Throughout its extent the line is exposed to wilful damage by passengers and wandering tribes, and even by the resident population, who not unfrequently cut the wire near a neighbouring village with whose inhabitants they happen to be at feud. The natives are utterly untrustworthy in the perform ance of even the most trivial duties. Lastly, the power of the Central Government, despotic as it is, is extremely limited in the provinces, where the Governors act, while in office, very much as they please, and a system of police is quite unknown. ' Under such circumstances the difficulties of guarding, maintenance, and repair, are of course very great, especially with the small European staff in the country, most of whom are necessarily employed as clerks in the principal offices. Ihe following is the system now in force, which has been adopted as the most practicable. Eacli of the three divisions is sub divided into three sections, in charge of as many non -com missioned officers of the first detachment of Koyal Engineersv.] DIRECTOR'S CONCLUDING PARAGRAPHS. 319 who act as inspectors. Their duty is to go over their sections once in botli directions every month, making such repairs as the line may require, and paying and looking after the horsemen stationed at eacli office for restoring communication in every case of interruption. Besides the principal stations, Bushahr, Shiraz, Ispahan, lehran, Hamadan, and Karmanshah, inter mediate ones have been established at Kazarun, between Bushahr and Shiraz; Dehbid (in progress), Abadeh and Kumishah, between Shiraz and Ispahan; Kashan and Kum, between Ispahan and Tehran; Nobaran, between Tehran and Hamadan; and Kirind, between Karmanshah and the Turkish frontier. These, with the principal stations, divide the whole distance into fourteen sections, of an average length of nearly ninet} miles. At each intermediate and principal station, at least four horsemen, paid by the English inspectors, are kept in readiness to ride out in the direction of a break, and repair it as rapidly as possible. A daily patrol would be more satisfactory, but is quite impossible in this country. We have found by experience that no Persian can be entrusted with the duty of patrolling, even when regularly and liberally paid. First, unless there is someone to see him, he never goes under the wire, but simply along the road. Secondly, he thinks of nothing but plunder, and not unfrequently cuts the wire himself, in order, by accusing some unfortunate passenger, to extort money through ns ftars. lui these and other reasons we had to give up all hope of ever establishing an efficient patrol, and to content our selves with the present system of repairing. And even this plan, simple as it may appear, is not without its difficulties.' We quote the concluding paragraphs :— I beg to express my hearty acknowledgment of the invaluable services of Lieutenants St. John and Pierson, whose discretion, now e ge of the country and personal influence with the local au onties have been of perhaps even more importance than • en P rofe ssional zeal and ability.

' My best thanks are due to Colonel Sir Arnold Kemball and Lieutenant-Colonel Telly, for their invariable kindness and assistance in every way that lay in their power. The roaming duties of the Chief Director had prevented him from supplementing these reports, when originally submitted, with a forwarding letter of his own ; but when able to supply the deficiency, lie readily did so. We shall bring the present chapter to an end by one or two extracts from his official communication on the subject addressed to Bombay from London, and the Government resolutions in reply ; premising that the story of the Kusso-Persian line will be told in the chapter imme diately succeeding :— ' The correspondence respecting the construction ot a tele graph line through Persia (1861-63) printed in 1864, as a Parliamentary Record, affords full intormation on the means by which was obtained from the Shah's Government an alternative to the section of the Indo-European telegraph betweenBaghdad and Bushahr. After-events and experience have shown that this particular section must, by the force of circumstances, be con sidered important rather -in its capability ot securing a geneial alternative to the whole European line, than as applied to the few hundred miles in and near the Persian Gulf: that is to say, of the whole distance from Khanikin to Bushahr, the two-fifths leading from Khanikin to Tehran may be considered out of the main Russo-Persian line, whose junction with the Indian and Indo-Persian system is effected at Tehran. It is to the three- fifths, or distance between Tehran and Bushahr, that attention must be given to make the Russian route in any w a} efficient, if not actually available, ' At the same time, the link between the two great alterna- 1 Major R.

And though the section of telegraph joining Tehran to Baghdad did not promise to be one of frequent use, the cause was to be attri buted more to petty jealousies and old national antipathies, than to any failure ot its own to perform tlie functions required. Therefore, on the proposal of the late Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick Stewart to secure a whole wire to the British Government on the Persian lines, in place of a share in the one wire obtained by the earlier negotiations, the arrangement was to have effect for the full distance from Khanikin to Bushahr, and not to be confined to a single section. 'In June 1865 I proceeded to Persia, under the instructions of the Eight Hon. the Secretary of State for India, to assist her Majesty's Minister at Tehran in negotiating with the local Government for a wire on the then existing line of telegraph, to be reserved entirely for Indo-Piuropean messages, and worked entirely by British officials in the pay of her Majesty's Govern ment. I need not here recite the process by which the desired end was attained, the difficulties in the way of attainment, or the modifications in Colonel Stewart's original proposals which it became necessary to admit into the ratified Convention. On my departure from Tehran in December of the aforesaid year, the necessary stores and materials had been telegraphed for, and preparations had already been made for renovating and strength ening the posts on which the second wire was to be set up.' Accounting for the delay through which the whole oi 18G6 and half of 1867 passed away before the terms of the Anglo-Persian Convention had been literal ly fulfilled by erection of the second wire, the writer does not hesitate to arrive at a conclusion absolving the British staff of officers and men from all responsibility for tardy execution, and at the same time liighly favourable to their character for zeal and industry. He adds I ^ | Pi. r h rn322 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. ' The completion of the work at all, in eighteen months, must afford abundant proof how much lias been achieved by the unfailing energy and perseverance of the English superintendents and their assistants, on whom the onus of labour fell.' 1 The five next paragraphs refer to questions of detail more or less foreign to the general narrative. The next is confirmatory, from personal acquaintance, of the high character given by Major Smith and his assistants to many of the individuals named in their reports. The remain ing paragraphs are quoted either wholly or in part. ' The non-commissioned officers from Chatham have not only had to perform duties demanding scientific or mechanical ability : their work demands, moreover, an exercise of responsi bility, and withal temper and discretion, which would tax the training of commissioned officers of Indian repute. If they have occasionally erred in this respect, it cannot but be borne in mind how constantly and steadily the majority have succeeded; and success of this nature implies indirectly the spread of wholesome English influence in a quarter of no small interest. 'Lieutenant St. John places on record the acknowledgments which he considers due to the Hisam-u-Saltaneh, or Frince- Governor of Ears, for unvarying kindness and courtesy, and assistance generally to his work of superintendence. Much credit is also due to Lieutenant St. John himself for securing the good offices and friendship of his Royal Highness, who is one of the most distinguished and influential men in Persia. ' As regards the services of Major R. Murdoch Smith, for more than two years Acting Director of the Persian telegraphs, and his immediate assistants—notably Lieutenants St. John and Pierson, whose reports are submitted to Government— I am convinced 1 Lieiit.-Colonel Goldsmid, C.B., to Secretary to Government; No. 138 of 21st October, 18G7.1NDIVIDUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. that it would be difficult to find officers better adapted for the delicate and often arduous and trying duties which they are called upon to fulfil in Persia. I can certify from personal experience that Major Smith's testimony to the character of his assistants is no other than the expression of an impartial and unbiassed judgment. And I can further certify, that the encomiums which he has passed upon these officers would be no less deserved if applied to his own case. 'While expressing thus publicly my obligations to the officers employed in setting up the second wire of the Persian telegraph, and submitting this expression of opinion to the favourable consideration of Government, I should fail to do justice to the occasion were I to omit the name of Major Champain, RE. This officer accompanied the late Colonel Patrick Stewart to Persia in 1862, and was afterwards appointed Director of Telegraphs in that country. He assisted her Majesty's Minister in the early negotiations for the line, and superintended its original construction. The task was not an easy one. Ihe field was comparatively new. Opposition was rife in every quarter. Major Champain, with his assistants, Captain Smith, Lieutenants St. John and Pierson, and Mr. Walton, overcame all obstacles, and the 1,100 miles of tele graph from Khanikin to Bushahr were opened in March I860. Subsequent events called Major Champain to England, and for the last two years his sphere of usefulness has been confined to Lurope. The services which he has rendered will, it is hoped, ere long be apparent in the thorough organization of Tndo-Luropean traffic by alternative routes, a desideratum which only constant experience and vigilance can enable its superintendents to achieve in so long a line as that connecting London with Calcutta and the other Indian Presidencies.' In conclusion, Lieutenant-Colonel Goldsmid respec- fully invited attention to the acknowledgments re corded in Major Smith's report and accompaniments to Lieutenant-Colonel Pelly, the Resident at Bushalir, who i '■ ui t il324 TELEGBAPH AND TRAVEL.

MEASURES TAKEN GENERALLY TO IMPROVE TELEGRAPHIC COMMUNICATIONS WITH INDIA FROM FIRST ORGANIZA TION TO CONGRESS OF VIENNA, 1868. —LAYING SECOND CABLE BETWEEN JASK AND BUSHAHR.—EXTENSION OF MAKRAN COAST-LINE WESTWARD TO JASK ; WITH SUM MARY OF MORE RECENT PROCEEDINGS. I t has been shown that on Colonel Goldsmid's departure for Persia, in June 18G5, Major Champain's attention was drawn to the palpable advantages to Indo-Euro pean telegraphic communications obtainable from the institution of an alternative line through Russia to the Persian capital, and thence to Bushahr, where it would meet the Government cable. He had, indeed, written a short memorandum on the subject, which Colonel Gold- smid took with him to St. Petersburg, and re-transmitted to London from that city with his own comments. Russia was well disposed to assist the cause, and Dr. Siemens, head of a well-known firm in London, and him self a gentleman of high scientific attainments, and special ability as a practical telegraph engineer, 1 had 1 Charles William Siemens, Esq., F.R.S. D .C .L., has too deservedly wide pntation to need more than mention by name in a work of this nature. ■ Jj * t!4! * 1 UM TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. expressed willingness to help any scheme of tlirougli com munications from St. Petersburg to the 1 eisian frontiei, provided, only he held further control of the 1 cisicin line from the frontier to Tehran, where English work began. It was not that Indian messages were shut out of the Kusso -Persian line then existing : some were sent by that route but in practice it was found less tiust\\ oithy tliiin the Indo-Ottoman, and nothing had been done to put in order or organize a complete traffic, vid Russia and Persia, to India. There were lines of some kind in Russia from the Baltic or the northern Prussian frontier, more or less, to Tiflis and the Persian frontier, and there was a kind of a line from Julfa, on the frontier, to Tehran: moreover, long before the conclusion of our own lb65 Convention with Persia, there had been signed by that State a treaty with Russia, consisting of articles regu lating international telegraphic correspondence, as though such correspondence was a recognised institution. But all was crude,*Very crude. The Indian mercantile com munity, and others interested in telegraphs to India, made long and loud complaints against Turkey; but at this period it had no cause to be more satisfied with Russia. The first year that England interchanged mes sages by wire with India was not a successful one any where in steady telegraphic working ; but those whose duty it was to watch causes and results, were more sanguine of eventual success than those who looked to results only, and were indifferent to reasons. On the 31st A.ugust, 1865, while the Chief Director was endeavouring to advance negotiations in Tehran, Major Champain submitted a memorandum in favour of an alternative land-line, vid St. Petersburg, Tiflis, and Tehran, ' which would, in case of failure of the BaghdadVI -] PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE. .3.,7 line, take the whole of the Anglo-Indian traffic, or under any circumstances, tend to keep up a healthy spirit of rivalry in the nianagement of the opposition or Turkish line.' He considered in it the propositions to be made to the Russian and Persian Governments respectively in furtherance of the scheme, and the questions of rates on either line: but as his forwarding letter showed that objection existed to promote, by diplomatic intervention, any alternative measure detrimental to a power with which we had so recently signed a Telegraph Convention, there was little hope that authority would be given for immediate or effectual action. And so it was in reality. There was no course but constant watching, and continual pressure; the first, a matter-of-fact, business like piocedure, in connection with posts and wires; the second, a silent and ungracious task, in connection with dignitaries and officials. In October 1865, Colonel Gold- smid addressed to the Assistant Director a letter from Tehran, suggesting that his presence might be useful on the continent of Europe in improving the still highly defective state of communications between the Persian Gulf cable and western Europe ; and in February 18G6 Major Champain had removed to Constantinople. His report from that city in the April following, and the Chief Director's of the previous November from Tehran, are specially referred to in the report of the Select Com mittee on East India communications, sitting in London at the date just mentioned, as affording material infor mation on the whole question. 1 In evidence given before that committee, it is stated that ' Major Champain was sent out to Constantinople with the intention of going along the line and reporting on it; but he found 1 See page 10, par. 37 ; aud Appendix, pages 43G to 411, and fil9 to 625.328 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. that such an improvement had taken place during the last two or three months, that he has not thought it necessary to do so.' 1 Later in the year, Colonel G-old- smid, on return from Persia, was personally examined; and, among other questions of detail, gave evidence on the then state of the Kusso-Persian line. He was of opinion that the imperfect communication between Tehran and Tabriz was one of the chief causes of its failure. 2 We have already mentioned that Major Champain had joined Colonel Goldsmid in Paris, in October 1866, when the latter officer \vas en route again to Persia, which country he had only left some nine months before. His report to the Under Secretary of State, dated the 27th idem, revives the proposal of an improved line through Russia :— ' Colonel Goldsmid,' he writes, ' on leaving England had in tended to proceed to Berlin, in order to meet Mr. Wilson of the Electric and International Company, and in concert with him to endeavour to get a special wire through Prussia and Austria. . . Departure from London had however been considerably delayed, and it seemed very doubtful whether he could get to Berlin and meet Mr. Wilson, and then proceed to Vienna and arrive in time to catch the last boat of the season down the Danube for Con stantinople. I therefore undertook the Berlin negotiations myselt, and left Paris on Tuesday morning. At 7 A.M. on Wednesday 1 reached Berlin, met Mr. Wilson, and at once waited on the British Ambassador, to present a letter of introduction given by Lord Stanley to Colonel Goldsmid, and to explain why I had come in place of the latter officer.

[chap. made to the Turkish and other continental Governments with a view to the improvement ot telegraphic com munication with India.' The India Office considered that the action taken by Lord Lyons was just what was required in Turkey. He had backed up the telegraph ofticers in their proposals for special wires for the par ticular service required, and he had warned the authori ties at the Porte that unless attention were given to these and similar measures, Indian correspondence ' would take a different route, from which it would be difficult subsequently to divert it. As regards arrangements with the Governments of European States west of Turkey, for distant wires for Indo -European messages, Lord Lyons' opinion of the importance of these was fully concurred in ; and the unofficial action taken already in the matter by Colonel Goldsmid and Major Champain had met with a satis factory result. Should the Foreign Office think fit to further the cause by intimating to the several Govern ments concerned how much interest was taken by her Majesty's Government in the matter, it might be well to correct an erroneous impression on the part of some ot the continental Administrations, that the Indian Ad ministration had a preference for any particular line, and to notify to them that the Indian public were ' perfectly at liberty to send telegrams either by the lurkish 01 Russo-Persian branch of the Indo-European telegraph, whichever they might at any time consider most suitable for their purposes.' 1 About three or four months later.

They offered to construct an independent double line of telegraph from London to Tehran, provided that her Majesty s Government would grant certain advantages, characterised as ' indirect,' namely ; 1st. lo put their line on the same footing as any other respecting transmission of messages, leaving the public free to select in the matter. 2nd.

Letter to Major Champain, dated February 7, 1867.332 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. ' If you will refer to the Constantinople traffic-returns,' said Major Champain, writing to the India Office on the 12th Febru ary, 1867, 'you will see that at no period since the opening of the Indo-European telegraph has the condition of the Turkish lines, both European and Asiatic, been more deplorable than during the past few months. The irregularity in the transmission of despatches is perhaps as vexatious as the general slowness; and the want of accuracy in the through signalling has given rise to very many complaints. ... For a month or two all may go well, but just as the public begins to realise the improved state of affairs, a break-down takes place, and the general confi dence is once more thoroughly uprooted The truth is that to ensure rapidity of transmission we must have wires ex tending from end to end of the line exclusively set apart for the through traffic. Until this is done our Indian messages will be constantly detained, and occasionally almost lost sight of, in the press of local traffic at some of the many continental stations on the line. Special wires would also very materially reduce the number of inaccuracies which now disfigure our through tele grams. Under the present system of working it surprises me that a message should ever reach England from India without mistakes. When it is remembered that the telegram is originally expressed in cramped or abbreviated language, to avoid expense, and is then received and retransmitted twelve or fourteen times by Armenian, Greek, Turkish, German, French or Italian signal lers, who probably possess an excessively faint knowledge of English, it must at once be seen how difficult it is to avoid the introduction of errors, which are exaggerated and give rise to others at every repetition. This would be the case if the work to be performed were the simple copying and recopying of ordinary handwriting; but the use of the Morse code of telegraph signals, simple though it is, at once introduces a new element of un certainty, and greatly increases the chance of error. Thus, asm ordinary handwriting, two consecutive m's might easily be mis taken for a variety of combinations of the letters w, n, u, or i , so in the Morse alphabet almost every letter can be mistaken for combinations of others. An i is the same as two e's, an h thevr.] AGREEMENTS FOR ALTERNATIVE LINE. .333 samG as t^o i s, ainl so on. In good signalling, as in good hand writing, errors need not of course occur, but where from frequent repetition many clerks are employed in the manipulation of each message, and on account of their ignorance of the language in which it is couched, assistance cannot be obtained froin the context, it is clear that perfect accuracy is not to be looked for.' He dwelt especially on the complaints of the merchants and others to whom the telegraph was becoming a neces sity, and urged that not only was confidence failing in the line as then available, but traffic was diminishino'. He admitted that the Russo-Persian was no better than the Indo-Ottoman line, but maintained that the difficul ties of improving the former were not of the description which had been proved to exist for the latter. He then proceeded to illustrate his argument by an exposition of the project he so strongly approved ; nor did he see any difficulty in recommending that her Majesty's Govern ment should agree to the moderate conditions asked for by the gentlemen representing the firm whose proposals had been submitted. This letter was followed up by a statement of all that had been done to secure special wires on the Turkish route since Colonel Goldsmid's departure from Constantinople. The latter officer was at Tehran when a report of the revival of the project of a new line through Russia and Prussia reached him. Lest any doubt should exist on his own views of the propriety or otherwise of the purposed scheme, he addressed the nder Secretary of State with reference to the Assistant Director's letter submitting it. The Russian Minister at Tehran,' he wrote, 'is very much m favour of availing himself of such assistance for the line cm Julfa to Fell ran, without regard to any arrangements made 'J the Russian Government for the traffic in Europe. As I334 telegraph and travel. [chap. believe that his Excellency has so expressed himself in com munication with his own Government, and as her Majesty s Min ister in Persia saw no objection to my discussion of the question with M. de Giers, it is my opinion that at least this part of Messrs. Siemens' proposal should meet with every encouragement. I am not prepared to say that the management of the entire line could be better conducted by a private firm than by the depart mental officers of continental Governments. But this is a matter which naturally depends so much on the pleasure of those Governments, that any further discussion of the point appears needless. Major Champainhas placed before the Right Honour able the Secretary of State a full and comprehensive report, leav ing little to be desired in the way of elucidation. But I may be pardoned for repeating my assurances, that, supported by the diplomatic agency proposed in the memorandum submitted to her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople in January last, we should infinitely improve telegraphic communication in Europe, so far as regards the transit of Indian telegrams ; and in all probability secure the special wires generally admitted to be the great desideratum. And the argument would hold equally good whether the Russian wires were in private or in Government hands ; for it is too much to anticipate a continuous monopoly for one particular line ' 2 The very careful and elaborate paper addressed at this period by Colonel Von Chauvin, the zealous and able Director of the Prussian Telegraph Department, to Major Champain, not only exhibiting a thorough knowledge of the subject, but a keen sympathy with the objec contemplated, concluded with an intimation that the writer had been authorised by his Government to ne gotiate the whole matter with the Russian Governmen at St. Petersburg, where he would be joined r - Werner Siemens, of the firm of Siemens and Has e, 1 See Appendix to this chapter. 2 No. 46 of the 15th March, 1867.VI -] 22 USSO-PE USSI AN AGREEMENT. 335 and Mr. SchUtz Wilson, of the Electric and International Telegraph Company. And this intimation was acoom panied by an invitation to Major Champain to attend the conference proposed as delegate of Great Britain, or perhaps^ rather as accredited representative of her Majesty s Indian Government. About a month after receipt of this communication Major Champam arrived at St. Petersburg, empowered to act discretionally in supporting the interests he served but without authority to sign agreements or treaties or commit his Government in any way by pledge or gua- ran ee. Qn the 1st of May, the fourth day after arrival, he telegraphed to Colonel Goldsmid, who had returned on that date from Hamadan to Tehran; ' arrangee. No time had been lost.

[chap. world, and those to whom an efficient and a reliable tele graph between Western Europe and India was one of the exigencies of professional life. It may be said that the Red Sea cable, and the submarine adjuncts, superseded the necessity for this line ; but the deep-sea lines had not been planned when the Siemens remedy was found for the Turkish shortcomings ; and it was in mistrust of all then existing land telegrapli communications that the scheme was matured and recommended to the public. The written instruments obtained by Messrs. Siemens Brothers, of London, and Siemens and Halske, of Berlin, were of a comprehensive kind. That of the Russian Govern ment, confirmed by his Majesty the Czar on the 1st of September, 1867, granted to them an exclusive con cession for erecting and working a direct telegraphic communication between London and India, ' that is to say, between Europe and India,'' within the frontiers of the Russian empire. It was of twenty-three articles, of which the general tendency was to secure freedom of action and Government support for the work to be carried out. Of the conditions or reservations, the most im portant of all were those contained in the seventeenth clause, limiting the terms of agreement to twenty-five years. Independently of these it was natural that a royalty should be demanded, And five francs upon twenty words was no great consideration. It was also natural that the route selected for the contemplated line should be determined under sanction of the local Government. On the expiration of the term specified, the article pro vides that ' the privileges are to cease, and the conces sionaires must in due time come to an agreement with Government as to the further working of the Anglo- Indian telegraph line. Should no such agreement beTHE SIEMENS CONCESSION. come to, the entire undertaking, as it is carritd out under the conditions of the present concession, is to pass over into the hands of the Government without com pensation and in good condition.' That of the Prussian Government, dated Berlin, August 26'th, 1867, granted 'a concession for the con struction and working of telegraph lines from London to the isortli German coast, so far as concerns Prussian territory (corresponding to the concessions demanded from the Imperial Russian and Persian Governments, for the purpose of erecting and working a direct tele graph between London and Tehran, that is to say London and India),' under seventeen conditions. ihe first four of these bound the concessionaires as to materials and time in the construction of a land-line and cable from London to the Prussian North Sea coast. The fifth undertook, on the part of the Prussian Govern ment, to construct and keep in good and efficient working- condition during the term of the concession, from the landing-points of the cables to the Prusso-Russian frontier, two special wires of good material and large size, to be reserved exclusively for Anglo-Indian correspondence. Ihe next twelve articles need no specification, but were, upon the whole, liberal to the concessionaires. The seventeenth and last article limited the term of the con cession in this case also to twenty-five years, giving the concessionaires the right, on its expiration, should no agreement on this head be renewed, ' to employ their submarine lines between the German and Ensrlish coasts for the transmission of international correspon dence.' That of the Persian Government, sanctioned by his Majesty the Shah on the 11th January, 1868, granted z338 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. ' an exclusive concession for erecting and working a line of telegraph between the Russian frontier (Julfa) and Tehran,' in continuation of a direct line from London to Julfa, and for the transmission only of messages be tween India and Europe. As in the case of the two concessions already noted, the term was limited to twenty-five years ; at the expiration of which, failing a new understanding, the line was to be handed over to Persia, without indemnity and in good condition. There were sixteen articles, of which the ninth seems to demand separate notice. By this the concessionaires renounced the right of participating in the receipts on international telegrams passing between Julfa and Tehran, and vice versd, until expiry of the Anglo-Persian Convention of November 1865, on condition that then existing rates along that section were not raised. But on the expiry of the said Convention, unless a new one were made with the British Government, the Tehran-Bushahr line should be handed over to the concessionaires under certain rules and reservations. If a new Anglo-Persian Convention on the other hand were substituted for that of 1865, the concessionaires would then become entitled to one-third of the charge fixed upon for telegrams be tween Julfa and Bushahr, warranted not to exceed 10^ francs. And it was further stated, that 'should the tariffs on the other lines be modified,' the concessionaires would pay to the Persian Government integrally 2 francs for each telegram, the latter reserving the right of claim ing 2 francs per telegram of twenty words, or a fixed annual sum of 12,000 tomans — about 4,000^. To review the measures taken generally to improve Indo-European telegraphic communication from first or ganization, we must return for a while to Constantinople.VI.] LONDON AND THE BOSPHOIiUS. 339 It has been shown that at the very outset of working from Europe to India through Turkey, the difficulty to be surmounted was not merely that of setting up and utilizing a line through semi-barbarous regions, but of interchanging telegrams regularly, rapidly, and surely, with Constantinople itself. A Convention had been signed and sealed before Colonel Stewart's death, providing for the traffic east of the Turkish capital: but it was only during his actual residence in Turkey, and close upon the period of his last illness, that he became painfully and practically aware that out of five or more lines of telegraph between London and the Bosphorus, not one was reliable. And it is not unreasonable to believe that the disappointment occasioned in his mind by the little zeal and unsym pathetic support of the iurkish authorities in promoting the cause he had at heart served to aggravate his phy sical complaint. Men differently constituted would have accepted the position as not only inevitable, but in the natural order of things. To him, an obstacle was apparent uliich it was his duty to remove, to clear the way to a great end. He saw how to do it, but was not permitted to raise an arm. He might advise, recommend, and await results : but action upon his advice and recom mendation was in the hands of others ; and their mode of working, as their tone of thought, was other than his own. After his death, an attempt was made by those who succeeded him to follow the course he had indicated and begun. Colonel Goldsmid's proceedings during the remainder of his stay at Constantinople in 1865, and Major Champain's at the commencement of the following year, have been already noticed : but we have yet to render an account of official results when the former officer340 TELEGRAPH AND TEAVEL. [chap. revisited the city of the Sultan in 1866 en route to Persia. He had passed through Persia and Vienna, and from Vienna he had reported progress. The letter is freely quoted :— 1 ' In August last I met Sir James Carmichael, Cliainnan of the Submarine Telegraph Company, in Paris, to confer with M. de Vougy, Director-General of French Telegraphs, on the possi bility of procuring a special wire for our Indian messages tra versing France. The Director-General saw no difficulty in giving us what we required, provided that our telegraph companies improved the existing means of communication between London and Paris, and that we could make satisfactory arrangements for our Indian traffic between Vienna and Constantinople. He promised, however, to do his best for us, if I would write him semi-officially on the subject.' A letter was accordingly written and authoritatively approved. The report then refers to an interview held between Colonel Goldsmid and Major Champain on the one side, and the French Director-General on the other, in October:— ' M. de Vougy told us plainly he was ready to meet our wishes, but that it was useless to arrange simply for a special wire through France unless Austria would do her part as well. I had certainly been under the impression at our former inter view that the French Director-General would undertake to make the necessary arrangements up to Vienna itself, in communica tion with the Administrations concerned ; and 1 referred to what had before passed between us. M. de Vougy said I might tell M. Brunner, the Austrian Director, from him, that he was quite willing to give us a wire in France on the Paris and A ienna route, if the Austrians would act in like manner. . . .

To economise time, I resolved to proceed to* Vienna direct, leaving Major Champain to be my substitute in Berlin.' From the last-named city he received, at Vienna, a telegram from Mr. Wilson, of the Electric and Inter national Company, as follows:—Special arrangements between us and you impossible. Other arrangements pending, vid Odessa.' At Vienna he saw Count Mensdorff, Minister of Foreign Affairs, M. Wullersdorff, Minister of Commerce, and eventually, M. Brunner. '* A long conference held with him resulted in a proposal on his part to summon a meeting of specially-deputed telegraph officials from Austria, Servia, and Turkey, to arrange for two lines of communication between Vienna and Constantinople, one of which might always be available for Anglo-Indian traffic. This meeting would be convened by Austria or Turkey, and I (or any other authorized officer) would attend on the part of the Government of India. Without such arrangement, by which each contracting party could be bound, by yrocls verbal, to pro vide particular wires on particular lines for Indian as well as, if necessary, other correspondence, M. Brunner was of opinion that he could attain no satisfactory conclusion. He fully admitted that the'grand defect was between Vienna and Constantinople, and I assured him that our Asiatic lines were becoming com paratively trustworthy and efficient. He considered that any arrangement for special wires between Paris (or Berlin) and Vienna was quite a secondary affair, for there were sufficient wires for every purpose on both lines. The Electric and Inter national could work perfectly well with Vienna by Holland and Berlin, and the Submarine by Paris and Basle, without making any such provision I subsequently saw his Majesty's Charge d'affaires. . . It was his belief that the Austrian authori-342 TELEHUA I'll AND TRA VEL.

I see no reason why there should not be a line, vid Odessa, independent of Austria (as well as those vid St. Peters burg and Tiflis, and Paris and Turin), if really obtainable, for the Indo-European traffic. But I think we should first give atten tion rather to the perfection of one or two of the whole number of existing lines than to increasing the number of lines generally. And as regards the proposed arrangements with Turkey, M. Brunner has shown me that very little is wanting to complete two efficient lines of traffic ; one through Servia by Belgrade and Nissa, as promised long ago for Indian messages by the Ottoman Administration; and one through Agram and Bosni Serai already constructed by the Austrian and Turkish Administrations to their respective frontiers, but not yet utilized, because the Turks on their part have failed to put up a second wire for international correspondence. I would respectfully submit my recommendation that—unless some, to me, unknown advantages have been offered in an entirely new channel, which render ad visable the comparative abandonment of the hitherto acknow ledged best routes—an officer on the part of the Indian Govern ment may be authorized to attend any such conference as that proposed by the Austrian Director. If held at Constantinople within the month, my presence there could so far be secured without detriment to the service, as I have every prospect of detention in quarantine for ten days, in addition to the time to be occupied in travelling, and settling, with Mr. Courtenay, those questions of account and organization now awaiting my arrival.' In reply, the Chief Director was authorized to attend the meeting alluded to in his letter, if held within a convenient time, and without hindrance to the special duties with which he was charged.; but his presence was to be merely in the capacity of an adviser, and his action should not go beyond pointing out the advantages which might be ' expected to accrue to the countries represented,vi.j UNSATISFACTORY WORKING IN EUROPE. 343 from the formation of improved lines of telegraphic com munication with India, and testifying to the interest which the Indian Government take in the matter.' 1 On the 12th December, Colonel Goldsmid submitted, from Constantinople, to the India Office, the copy of a letter which had been addressed by him to her Majesty's Ambassador at the Porte at his Excellency's request, 2 together with accompaniments. The lettar contained the following passages, and gave cover to a memorandum reprinted in extenso :— ' I do myself the honour of bringing to notice that the work ing of the Indian telegraph in the Ottoman dominions is still most unsatisfactory, and to a great extent nullifies the objects for which the Convention of the 3rd September, 1864, 3 was concluded. ' In that Convention, if no mention was made of the Turkish European lines, it must have been that full confidence was placed in the superior advantages of the European system, and that provisions rendered necessary for introducing, as it were, an important innovation through a comparatively uncivilized country, would be out of place west of Constantinople; but in practice it has been found that, as a rule, the Asiatic works better than the European line With the sanction of her Majesty's Secretary of State for India, and under the impression that a line of telegraphic communication between England and India cannot be held restricted in usefulness to the terminal stations only, Lut must more or less command the interest of intervening continental States, I recently put the question of giving a special wire to this service to the French and Austrian Administrations. The result promises to be successful in obtain ing due attention to our requirements from these and other 1 Under Secretary of State to Colonel Goklsmid, November 25, 186G.

[chap. authorities concerned, ' provided we can secme a icgular and rapid communication between Constantinople and \ ienna. This last is, no doubt, the one section of our whole line which at present requires the greatest attention, and the operation of the Convention of 1864 is so affected by its condition, at least within the limits of European Turkey, that it is quite as much foi the interest of the Ottoman Government as our own to have it con structed and organized on the most efficient footing. The brief summary of proceedings which followed may here be omitted, and the concluding paragraph of the letter alone quoted, in addition to the memorandum: ' Owing to the very great importance to the Government and public that no opportunity should be lost of perfecting the Indian communication as much as possible, I would respectfully submit to your Lordship's consideration a memorandum and accompaniments, which it might be deemed advisable to refer to his Highness the Minister for Foreign Affairs, either before or after my departure for Persia. ' M emorandum. ' The Indo-Ottoman Convention of the 3rd September, 1864, though not providing for any special line or wire for the passage of Indian telegrams through European Turkey, would be mani festly useless for the purpose contemplated if the arrangements in that respect were not perfected in accordance with the European system. ' Yet, at the outset of telegraphic operations under the con vention aforesaid, it was found that considerable delays occurred, owing to the faulty condition of the lines north and west of Con stantinople. .. ' In reply to a remonstrance addressed by Lieut.-Col. Goldsmi to the Ottoman Telegraph Department at this particulai period, Faizi Bey, then Acting Director-General in the absence o Agathon Efendi, wrote as follows, under date the 1st Apn, 1865VI.] PROPOSALS FOR AMELIORATION. 345 Je peux \ ous assurer, M. le Colonel, qu'ainsi qu'un fil special a etc afiectc en Asie a la correspondance telegraphique Indo-Europeenne, de meme deux fils out et^ designes en Euro])e pour la sus-dite correspondanee. L'un de ces deux fils est celui qui va de Constantinople vers la fronts re Turco-Italienne de Valona, et 1 autre de Constantinople a la fronti&amp;re Turco -Serbe de Belgrade.' 'A glance at the accompanying map will explain, that had this intention of giving two wires, each on a separate line, been efficiently earned out, we might reasonably have anticipated regular communication with Italy and Austria, or at least one of the two in the event of accident. But experience has proved that no dependence can be placed on either. The official records of the last six months alone show that the condition of both is very bad. 'Two courses have now been suggested for more effectual communication. . ' 1st. That a conference of delegates from the respective lelegraph Departments of Austria, Servia, and Turkey, should investigate and ascertain the causes of defective working, bind ing themselves, in writing, to provide the remedy. ' 2n d- That the Ottoman Telegraphic Administration should address the Austrian Administration to the effect that direct communication be at once regularly established between Con stantinople and Vienna. 'The first course was urged by Lieutenant-Colonel Goldsmid superintendent of the Indo-European line, on the part of the overnment of India, and might readily embrace inquiry into ie wo lines to Vienna, one through Servia, and one through Bosnia, which have recently formed the subject of discussion In connection with international telegraphy.

[chap. for the direct transmission of Indian messages to Vienna through the Ottoman dominions, must at once be looked to, both as re gards construction and maintenance. That the inspector has been wanting in his duty, or the line itself comparatively ill- constructed, may be inferred from the fact that the bad working of the eighth wire, declared to be special for Indian messages, has been reported to have lasted for five days in June last, eight in July, nine in August, eighteen in September, twenty in October, and twenty-three in November last. Messages sup posed to be in transit are thus shelved for days in the Pera office, ' As regards the promised wire to Valona, a like course should be pursued, for the bad working with Salonica is notorious, and this as a general rule; a state of things which may be certified on inquiry. A summary of Mr. Courtenay's previous reports on the subject is attached. ' The great improvement during the past year on the Turkish- Asiatic lines may be cited as a proof of the good results of a careful system of inspection and unusual energy on the part oi the employes generally. Should this improvement continue, and the system of direct working for long distances be kept up, as promised, the Turkish lines from Scutari to Fao bid fair to attain a working condition superior to that of many older lines in Europe. There appears no reason why, with improved or ganization, the Turkish -European lines should not keep pace with the wires on the other side of the Bosphorus.'

The letter con cluded with anticipations of a happy result to such prospective arrangement. 1 The mission on which Colonel Goldsmid was, at this time, more especially engaged, compelled him to leave Constantinople for Persia with as little delay as possible. He had been already detained two months, when em barking for Poti on the first weekly Russian steamer of the new year. The day before embarkation he addressed the following letter to her Majesty's Ambassador, in continuation of that of the 5th December: ' January ilk, 1867.

Had it not been that my presence in Persia appears neces sary to the disposal ot more than one question connected with our telegraph service in that country and the Persian Gulf, and that the approaching Ramazan is an unfavourable season for work in the departmental offices of the Ottoman Government, I should have suggested the propriety of my remaining here until completion of the present negotiations. As it is, I would bring to your Lordship's notice the fact that the written assur ance of laizi Bey, Acting Director of the Ottoman telegraphs in Agathon s absence, that he had given us a special wire on the Nissa and Belgrade line for Vienna, and another on that of Valona for Italy, has never been verified according to the spirit of the agreement entered into between us for securing efficient work. Had we had reliable wires, one on each of these lines, we should have had little cause of complaint against European Turkey. But though a wire was allotted us on the road to Nissa, its material and construction have failed to give it effi ciency. Indeed, data in proof of the late defective working of every wire on the Turkish lines are all available, and maybe obtained at any time from Mr. Courtena/s office. 'I regret to add, moreover, that for the last fortnight, and up to date, the telegraph in Asia has failed to keep up its improved character.' After the Chief Director's departure from Constanti nople, her Majesty's Ambassador continued to press the question of improved working with Vienna, in commu nication with Mr. Courtenay, and received a formal assurance from Fuad Pasha that the Director-General ttoman telegraphs had taken the necessary steps to secure two special wires on a special line of posts both or international and Indo-European correspondence. '■ co ry of a 'Projet d'Arrangement,' of Ten Articles350 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. between the respective Administrations of Austria, Servia, and Turkey, was, moreover, forwarded for Lord Lyons' information. The third article provided that one of the two wires noted should be used for the de spatch of international and Indo-European telegrams, and the other for their receipt. 1 Under instructions from home, Mr.Courtenay submitted that the exclusive use of one wire between A ienna and Constantinople would be preferred to the partial use of two wires in the interests of British India : but objection still offering to this arrangement, a compromise was eventually reached. The Telegraph Commissioner after wards notified that the Foreign Office had authorized Lord Lyons to accept two special direct wires between Vienna and Constantinople, one via Bosnia, the other via Servia, with absolute priority for Indo-European messages on whichever was best for the time being. 2 The next step in importance, and according to the chronological order of events, was the admission of O 7 British India into the community of European States, which, under an article of the Paris Telegraph Convention of May 18G5, were to meet at Vienna to revise the rules 1 The Minister wrote;—' L'Ail ministration Telegraphique n'aurait aucune objection a Clever contre la proposition d'affecter un til special a la corre- spondance Indo-Europ^enne, si elle pr^voyait nn avantage clans sa mise a execution.

CONGRESS. 351 subscribed to a,t the J 1 rencli Ccipital. The congress was not actually held until .Tune 18G8; but arraiigements for the participation in it of British Indian representatives were in active progress in the autumn of 18G7. Colonel Goldsmid returned from India in August of that year, and proceeding in the same month to Paris, at once opened negotiations to the required effect with the French Administration. There was something singular and at first sight anomalous in the position. England, as England, having no telegraphs belonging to her home Government, but having connected her Indian Govern ment lines with those of the continent of Europe, was led by the force of circumstances to seek representation of hci Indian inteiests at the European Jelegraph Congress. The inauguration meeting of delegates had been held in 1 aris, and as no second re-union had superseded its im mediate influences, it was to the Irench ex-President and Secretary that applications to join a new gathering- would naturally be addressed. Colonel Robinson, Director- General of telegraphs in India, was associated with the Chief Director and Assistant Chief Director of the Govern ment Indo-European line in some of the interviews necessitated by the case. After three or four visits to Pans, and much correspondence, in which her Majesty's Ambassador at the French Imperial Court took part as readily as he had done two years before under similar circumstances at Constantinople, the preliminaries were settled. 1 The main difficulties in the way to a satis factory understanding had been the mysterious mercantile cypher and the high rate charged for Persian Gulf cable messages; nor was the tariff on the Indian telegraphs of Mr. Menvale to the Under Secretary of State for Foreurn Affairs, of 'eo- 1, 1868. '352 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. a sufficiently liberal character to please the foreign Ad ministrations, all of whom, without exception, had been aiming at a cheap as well as efficient i liter nation ul system. The Declaration of Adhesion was accordingly signed in due form by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on behalf of her Majesty's Government. The next formal step was to join the re-union of Kuropean Stutes. Colonels Goldsmid and Glover were appointed the dele, gates of Great Britain, one for her Indo-European, and one for her Indian local telegraphs, and proceeded on their respective duties. The conference was opened at Vienna on the 12th June, and work was completed on the 22nd July, 1868. There were present twenty-nine representatives, their position at the board being arranged, more or less, according to alphabetical order. Austria, however, as the State in whose limits the meeting was held, occupied the presidential chair, with Hungary on the left, and an Imperial Commissioner on the right. A Secretary-General was appointed by the same Govern ment, but the French supplied the working Secretary and reporter of the proceedings. Baron de Beust attended in person to open the discussion. In one paragraph of his address allusion was thus prominently made to the adhesion of British India :— ' Since the institution by the Paris Convention of this great association of telegraph departments, its numbers have been recruited by new members. As its organ, 1 would express all the pleasure we feel in seeing here the representatives of the British Administrations, and I trust that the Imperial an Eoyal Government will be approved in having anticipated t e consent of the assembly by welcoming proposals which intro duce into the telegraphic system the electric wires uniting Inna with the West. The European character of our association shou &lt;.RESULT OF CONGRESS AS REGARDS INDIA. not suffer us to forget that the civilizing mission of which Europe has ever boasted would lead her to extend and not to restrain her sphere of action.' As the work performed by this assembly is no sealed record, but forms a printed volume of proceedings and results, in the French language, or of results only, in its English dress,' no attempt will be made to render it com prehensible in detail. Its more immediate action upon British Indian communications will be apparent from the folio win 0 extracts of an official paper on the subject:— 'irom the 1st January next, the maximum rate of a message of twenty words from London to Calcutta and vice versa will be 2/.

Under these circumstances, I do not think that the popular objection that telegraphic communication with India 1 Report of the delegates of her Majesty's Indian Government on the International Telegraphic Conference held at Vienna, submitted to the Secretary of State for India, August 19, 1868. 2 Conference Telegraphique Internationale de Vienne. Revision de la ' onvention de Paris. A A:i54 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. will be in the hands of one or two European powers, can be considered valid. ' I have further submitted for the ratification of the home Government a separate agreement drawn up and signed by my self, in concert with the delegates, at the recent conference of Eussia, Persia, 1 and Turkey, by which the Indo-Ottoman will act as the alternative to the Russo-Persian lines in Asia, and vice versa, in the event of interruption ; by which the anomalies of tariff hitherto found in the ruling of conflicting Conven tions will be removed ; and by which the equal division of messages heretofore stipulated between Turkey and Persia will give way to the free use of either line according to the requirements of the public.' 2 In the course of discussion the question of delays in the passage of Indo-European telegrams through Europe was brought before the meeting, and the dis satisfaction of the commercial world on the general state of the communications represented. It was, moreover, stated that petitions had been submitted to H.M. Government for the establishment of a line wholly independent of the continent of Europe. The French delegate supported with considerable warmth a pro posal to the Conference to move in the matter, and joining the protestations of his own country to those of England against an evil, the existence of which was undeniable, he suggested that a declaration should be formally made in the interests of the particular service alluded to, and with a view to amelioration. The suggestion was unanimously adopted, and a declaration in the sense contemplated placed upon the record. No doubt ample grounds for decisive action existed. There i General Liiders, the Director-General of Imperiiil Russian Telegraphs, represented Persia, as well as his own Government, on this occasion. Colonel Goldsmid to Secretary to Government, Bombay : No. 125 of August 7, 1868.VI -] COMPLAINTS OF PUBLIC. ^ had been great cause for discontent at the overland telegraph through lurkey and Persia. But somethino- also was to be said on the other side. The Chief Director had replied to the complaints urged at a public meetino- in the Mansion House and a long article in an influent tial weekly paper, by a pamphlet explanatory of the whole case. He showed that, whatever the shortcomings of the telegraph to India had been, there was well- grounded hope of improvement, if not by the Turkish, then by the Eusso-Persian lines : but more time and more patience were required. He showed that 'the recommendations of the Select Committee had been attended to, and that the most important of them were being carried into actual practice. One charge had been that the latest telegraphic communication from Abyssinia was twenty days old. This, he repre sented, was to be attributed to an interruption on the Malta and Alexandria cable, a contingency from which no cable made or guaranteed by Government could be exempt. Other charges, such as the existence of a monopoly on the Turkish lines, the long period for ^hith the line had been working without improvement, the precarious course taken by the wires, and the like] he was able to refute in mere point of fact. And with reference to the assumed general verdict of failure, ' in the common acceptation of the term,' it was argued that, so far from such being the case, the Indo -Ottoman me had, during the preceding month (February 186'H), transmitted by far the greater number of the 3,000 messages which passed between Europe and India, the remainder having gone by the Russo-Persian route.' 1 Sta and Prospects of the existing Tndo-European Telegraph.' A A 2356 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. As pertinent to the case, we may cite two further passages contained in a postscript to the pamphlet quoted. The one maintained that, although ' the question of a line through Russia, as an alternative to that through Turkey, had engaged the attention of the Directors of the Government Indo-European telegraph so far back as 1865 (the first year of working), the practical project of Messrs. Siemens Brothers took no definite shape until May 1867.' Its full realization was promised at the end of 1869 ; but its partial effect on intercommunications by telegraph with India had already been favourably felt. The other pointed to the coming Congress at Vienna for a natural remedy to ' spasmodic and irregular working, unintelligible rendering, and the thousand and one defects more or less apparent in the existing line to India, irrespective of physical causes.' And the likelihood of benefit was considered all the greater, because Turkey, an original member of the telegraph Congress for her European dominions, had just notified her adhesion to its rules on behalf of her Asiatic possessions. That the hopes expressed in favour of the Siemens line have been unwarranted, or that the recognition of British India as entitled to the privileges of a European international telegraph code was a superfluous act, no evidence of disproof is surely required beyond the tele graph statistics of 1870 to 1873 inclusive. Before taking leave of the Vienna Congress, it is impossible to omit mention of the splendid hospitalities exercised towards the various telegraph delegates as sembled in the Austrian capital. Among the many particular acts which might be mentioned in illustration, the following are noteworthy. The Ministers of Com-vi.] VIENNA FESTIVITIES. 357 merce, both at Vienna and Pesth, respectively invited the foreign visitors to special banquets in honour of the occasion. M. de Beust, at the time Chancellor of the Empire, was the distinguished cicerone to accompany them, on a kind of railway picnic, through the magnificent scenery of the near mountains, to the Semmering ; and the Emperor himself entertained them at dinner at the palace of Schonbrunn, conversing with each representa tive separately before sitting down, with those imme diately on his right and left hand at table, and with many again separately after the repast, and preparatory to the dispersion of the guests. One of the delegates at the inaugural meeting had expressed, on behalf of the whole number, a desire to be permitted to wait on his Imperial Majesty before commencing practical business; and the reply was a general invitation to dine at the palace. Nothing could exceed the accomplished politeness of the whole design, and its execution was as easy and successful as the response to the regal courtesy was unanimous. The conference at Vienna concluded, the next impor tant operation in strengthening the Indo-European tele graphic link was to carry out the alternate or second line of communication, from Gwadar to Jask by land, and from Jask to Bushahr by sea. The diplomatic part of the work has been already reviewed; so that reference is now made to mechanical or practical pro gress. Before leaving London for Vienna in 1868, Colonel Goldsmid had for long been in constant communication with the India Office and the telegraph Engineers regarding the choice of material for a second cable, to be laid between the proposed station of Jask and. m'' i ^ ■ 358 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. Bushahr. On the 25th May he reported 1 fully his programme of work for the ensuing cold season; and this necessarily included a decision on the above ques tion, as well as a detailed process for laying the new cable, and diverting a section of the old one from the Gwadar-Masandam course to a Gwadar-Jask -Hen- jam course to Bushahr. The opportunity appeared to him a desirable one for trying India-rubber in lieu of gutta-percha. Mr. Latimer Clark and Lieutenant Stiffe were referred to for opinions, and supported this view by their written replies. His own reasons for recom mending the change will, however, be more clearly seen in the following extracts of his letter to the Secretary of State:— 'But I have not confined investigation to these sources. 2 I have sought and obtained evidence elsewhere ; and the general result enables me to place on record an opinion in favour of procuring a core, which offers peculiar advantages in a hot climate. Were the measure no more than experimental, the time for experiment would be opportune, because communication is alternated by, not dependent on, the proposed line. But I look upon any proof of non-inferiority required for our purpose, to affect chiefly the question of ' durability,' in which gutta-percha has a high repute; and it will be observed that even in this respect Mr. Clark's evidence is not inconclusive. ' A strong and undoubtedly plausible argument on behalf of gutta-percha has been found in the manifest convenience of having one material for the two cables. But I would deferentially remark that, in a progressive age like the present, a rule of the kind might operate injuriously on submarine telegraphy, where 1 No. 100a of May 25, 1868 ; of which copy forwarded to Secretary to Government, Bombay, with 108 of June 3, 1868. 2 Reference is here made to the reports of Mr. Latimer Tlark and Lieut. Stiffe.VI.] HOOPER'S INDIA-RUBBEli CORE. there are alternate cables at work. The one would naturally fail before the other—especially when laid down at an interval of years—and yet renewal in such case should hardly be restricted to renewal of the same material, irrespective of new inventions of science. Nor should the renewal be made un necessarily costly, upon the principle that the introduction of a new and improved material must be simultaneously effected upon the two cables. ' That a cable with gutta-percha core can safely be joined to one with Hooper's material, Lieutenant Stiffe appears satisfied. But notwithstanding the satisfactory results of an experiment recently made to this effect, I am bound to state that the evidence obtained is not such as to warrant conviction of full security combined with feasibility. Time alone, and experience of the vicissitudes to which a Persian Gulf cable is subject, can decide the question conclusively. The point merits attention, because it might be found useful to introduce India-rubber into the shore end, even where the main core is of gutta-percha, in cases where intense heat renders exposure dangerous. ' If the suggestion be approved and adopted, I should recom mend that measures be immediately taken by the Store Depart ment to procure 525 miles of Hooper's core according to Mr. Clark s specification; that is, having a conductor weighing the same as the Persian Gulf cable, with sufficient India-rubber to give it the same electric capacity or working speed; the whole being covered to the same dimensions. The sheathing (and outer covering) might be similar to the pattern before adopted. Mr. Hooper would, it is concluded, be invited to make his new core, provided the requisite amount could be completed in three months, or in time for shipment and arrival in the Gulf by February, and tenders would be sought for the other portions of the work. But it should be clearly understood that it is the intention of Government to have the cable laid down before the end of the next working season.' The Bombay Government, to whom the question was referred in detail, approved generally the arrangements360 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. proposed for laying a new cable and modifying the course of the old one, and were content to place reliance on the Chief Director with regard to the material selected. Major Champain had left England in November 1867, to superintend the transfer of stations from Masandam to Jask and Henjam, as also the diversion of the cable from the first to the other two places ; but failing to carry out the work contemplated, from causes beyond his control, 1 he converted his mission into one of inspec tion of cable stations, and the Persian land-line between Bushahr and Tehran. Arrived at the capital, he was enabled to do further good service in aiding and advising her Majesty's Minister on certain questions pending with the Persian Government. He returned to London in time to give his professional knowledge and experience to the details of the Hooper's cable scheme; and during the Chief Director's absence in Vienna, his presence at head-quarters was especially opportune. Later in the year, and when Colonel Goldsmid had again proceeded to India, the whole management of the cable expedition was in his hands. The diversion to Henjam had become, by the force of circumstances, an entirely distinct affair, left to the management of the local officers, who had performed, as has been stated, their task with success. It had been hoped to complete the shipping of the new cable early in November, so that the work of laying might be accomplished before the hot weather had set in ; and the Chief Director had reckoned that his own arrival in India would be soon followed by that of the cable ships. He had already made two journeys from Bombay in the two exactly opposite directions of Calcutta and the Makran coast, and had returned from 1 Sef ante, page 298, and footnote.VI.] COLLISION OFF LIZARD. aei each respectively, when a telegram reached him, dated the 1st January, 1869, stating that heavy gales and failure in contractors' engagements had delayed de- parture ot the vessels, which could not under the circum stances be expected before the end of April. A second telegram reached him near the end of the same month, reporting that the Calcutta and Tweed, two ships taken up for the service, would sail, one on the 25th January, the other a week later. The ship with the Makran land- line stores had, on the other hand, arrived at Karachi, and the material was being shipped to the coast with all due despatch. But a sad calamity befell the first-named of the cable ships. Colonel Goldsmid was in Makran. He and the political officer, C aptain Ross, had sent on their small stock of baggage ahead, and had themselves just started from Gwadar, en route to Charbar, a port about a hundred miles or so further west, and along the dreary desert coast, when a telegram was brought to the former. It was from Major Champain, dated the pre vious day in London, and ran thus :— Calcutta came into collision off Lizard; captain and thirty men lost. Vessel abandoned, but brought into Plymouth bv the Terrible in a sinking state. Seventy miles cable had been thrown overboard to lighten ship. We have the Calcutta in dock and 200 miles of cable safe: hope to pick up the seventy. We expect Calcutta will start afresh in April.

[chap. Tweed's cable should be laid and buoyed immediately, and Calcutta's cable laid after monsoon.' On the 19th February, the following account of the disaster was addressed to the Chief Director 1 :— 'The Calcutta, a fine iron ship of 2,083 tons, owned by Messrs. Mackay, Son, and Co., and commanded by Captain Owen, an experienced and highly-esteemed officer, left Graves- end on Friday, the 29th January, with 273 miles of cable for Bombay and the Persian Gulf. ' The extraordinary persistence of south-westerly winds that have lasted with but slight intermission since November, led me, at the earnest request of the owners, to recommend that the ship should be towed clear of the Land's End to get a fair start for her long voyage. ' Severe gales kept the tug and the Calcutta for some days at the Nore, but on Friday, the 8th February, the two vessels parted company, and the Calcutta set sail in the best possible condition. ' On Saturday night she came into collision with a Russian barque, which immediately sank, four only of her crew of eleven men being saved. ' Such serious injuries were sustained by the Calcutta that after paying out and buoying all the cable in the fore tank (which contained seventy miles), and seeing that the vessel was apparently in a sinking state, the captain and crew decided to abandon her, and endeavour to escape in the ship's boats. ' Captain Owen and a considerable number of men were drowned in the attempt. AVe know at present that of the officers, crew, and cable hands on board, thirty-three escaped, twelve were undoubtedly lost, and twenty-one who formed the crew of the ship's lifeboat are missing. Hopes are entertained that the last-mentioned number were picked up by some out ward-bound vessel, as their boat was washed ashore, and had evidently never been capsized. 1 Mnjor Champain to Colonel Goldsniirl.vi] PARTICULARS OF DISASTER. 36[i On hearing of this calamity by a telegram from the crew of the first boat that reached land, I at once applied to t e Admiralty for assistance. 7t appeared that the Calmtta though abandoned, was still afloat, and we thought it possible that she might still be brought in. The fiigate Terrible was immediately ordered to put to sea in search, and the result was that on Wednesday the derelict Calcutta was brought in and moored under shelter of Plymouth breakwater. 'I started by night train for Plymouth, and after applica tion to Admiral Drummond, the Superintendent of the Devon- port Dockyard, permission was granted to bring the Calcutta into one of the basins at Keyham for repair; and the services of two Government tugs were rendered available for the purpose. Hie appearance of the unfortunate vessel was most deplorable. Her figure-head was wanting, and her foremast was hanging over the port side. Much of her rigging seemed carried away or dismantled, and she had more than twenty feet of water in her hold, which of course brought her down by the head in an extraordinary manner. 'Nothing but the strength of the bulkhead of the fore compartment, and the precautionary measure of paying out the seventy miles of cable, prevented the complete loss of t e ship, and as it was, her sinking was a mere question of time. We are now about to unship the cable still on board, so as to allow of the vessel being placed in dry dock and safety ; an we may reasonably expect to see her once more ready for sea in the course of two or three months. Steps have been taken to recover the seventy miles which ^ere 'jetsomed,' and Mr. Henley's steamer the Caroline will eave Plymouth with that object as soon as the violence of the gales shall have somewhat abated.' With regard to the sailing of the it was resolved, on mature consideration, to pay a specified rate 0 demurrage on that vessel, and detain her until her swter ship should be ready ; rather than start her sino-ly364 TELECrRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. and tlms cause a double expedition in the CJulf. The Secretary of State approved this decision, and notified the circumstances to the Bombay Government on the 29th of April. Eventually the Calcutta, refitted and repaired, left Plymouth with her charge on the 27th June, and three days later the Tweed left Gravesend. Colonel Goldsmid and Major Champain had both been on board the former a short time prior to departure; and Mr. Webb, on parting company from her four miles south of the Eddystone, reported she had ' a fair wind, all hands on board, and the steam launch 1 safely stowed.' The shipping surveyor to the India Office wrote, moreover, of the Tweed, from the scene of her weighing anchor, that she had 'just left in fine trim, in tow of two steamers.' The Calcutta and Tweed, indeed, made on this occasion a successful start, and the remainder of their voyage may be considered to have been accomplished in accordance with these fair auspices. But the whole expedition was not equally bright and felicitous. The serious injury done to the Calcutta was but the pre cursor of another fatal and unlooked-for incident. Major Champain, Mr. Latimer Clark, and the directing staff were on their way to join the cable ships over land, and had left Suez for Bombay in the P. and 0. Company's steamer Carnatic. On the 17th September Colonel Goldsmid received the following telegram from Major Champain, dated the day before at Suez : ' Carnatic utterly wrecked ; all telegraph party saved; ah mails and baggage lost.' 1 A purchase sanctioned for auxiliary duties connected with the Gulf cable and coast line.vi.] WRECK OF ' CARNA TIC.' . 3(55 So indeed it was ; and the case must be fresh in the memory of many readers of these pages. The vessel Lad left Suez on the morning of Sunday, the 12th of September. On Monday morning, at one o'clock, she struck on a coral reef off Shadwan island and remained humping till daylight, fruitless endeavours were made during the day to extricate her : and on Monday night it was understood that passengers and mails would be landed on the island, which was distant about five miles. During the night water was reported in the engine- room, and passengers were ordered on the forecastle. .Tuesday, the vessel, by parting midships, or sinking with the coral reef beneath her, went down with a crash, and the consequences may be imagined. The visible reef was reached by any means available, but not less than twenty-eight souls, fourteen Europeans and fourteen natives, perished. Eventually the survivors, after much endurance, were landed on Shadwan, where their position might have become more than precarious, had they not been rescued by the steamer Sumatra on her way from Bombay to Suez. Major Champain's con duct at this trying time was just what might have been expected of him. He was not only ready and eager to assist, but strong and capable to carry out his wishes. A sound adviser, a smart executive, a cheering comrade, his active usefulness amid the sufferers from the wreck will not soon be forgotten by those who could bear personal testimony to its exercise. And he himself has given ready witness to the noble exertions of the chief officer and others of his companions, whose names do not need this humble chronicle to make them eminent. After taking to Suez the crew and passengers of the Carnatic rescued from the reef, the Sumatra returned:m TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [ciiap. to Bombay ; and Major Champain, Mr. Latimer Clark, 1 and the other members of the Gulf expedition, availed themselves of the opportunity to resume then outward voyage. Bombay was reached by them in safety on the 1st October ; and they found there in harbour both the Tweed and Calcutta, which had arrived on the same day, the 21st September, after making excellent passages. As regards time, only one week had been lost by the accident of the wreck; but in other respects more serious damage had ensued, i he telegrapn officers had been compelled to resort to the wires at Suez to piocure from London essential instruments and papers, ns nothing in the shape of luggage had been saved, ihey were, however, enabled to leave Bombay on the 19th October, or in less than three weeks after arrival there. Major Champain, with Mr. Latimer Clark and staff, started at 9 a.m . on board the Dacca steamship of the British India Company, having in tow the Tweed and her share of cable. To tow the Calcutta, similarly freighted, the Earl Canning was engaged, and had taken precedence by three hours. The first of the steamers mentioned was of 1,700 tons and 350 horse-power, and had been chartered to tow first the Tweed to Jask, and then the vessel actually paying out cable. The second was o 150 horse-power only, but this provision was held sufficient to tow the Calcutta to Lingah, within tie entrance of the Persian Gulf, besides which duty she had only to render general assistance to the ships on their return. We give Major Champain s o\\n account of the operations :— 1 This gentleman met with a severe fracture on the occasion of the wreck.CABLE OPERATIONS IN GULF. 367 ' Early on the 25th, the Tweedy in tow of the Dacca, reached Jask. 1 he Earl Canning and Calcutta passed the next day on their way to Lingah, the port nearest to the spot where the Tweeds stock of cable would be expended. The Amberwitch, Irom Karachi, with Lieutenant Stiffe, Mr. Hirz, and a staff of signallers from the Persian Gulf telegraph establishment to assist in the operations, anchored close to our ships on the evening of the 26th. The Amber witch towed up from Karachi a steam barge for laying the shore ends, and for tranship- JASK, MAKRAN COAST. ment of stores and other service. The Jask telegraph office is built on a tongue of land stretching out in a south-westerly direction to sea, and is about 500 yards from the spot selected for landing the shore end. A trench had been dug, according to instructions previously given, from the office to the sea-shore, in readiness to receive the end of our cable. ' The Tweed being anchored as near the land as her draught of water would permit, the steam barge was brought alongside on the morning of the 27th, and sufficient shore end was coiled on board to reach from the ship to the beach and from the beach tothe office, altogether about 1,000 yards. The barge then steamed direct to the landing-place, paying out cable as she proceeded. A large party of workmen . . . was lent by Lieutenant Morgan, E.E. to drag the end of the cable from the barge, and to lay it in the trench, so that by about 3 p.m . the cable ship Tweed, was in direct communication with the Jask office. ' In the meantime Lieutenant Stiffe had started in the A mber- witch, and laid down two buoys to mark the direction which Captain Day of the Dacca was to follow. The Amherwitch had then gone out to a point about thirty miles along our course, where delicate steering was required in order to avoid overlaying the old cable, and was to burn blue lights so soon as the paying- out ships hove in sight. At 5 p.m . on the 27th October, the Dacca with the Tweed in tow left Jask, and steered the course laid down by Lieutenant Stiffe, the Tweed paying out her cable smoothly and well at from three to four knots per hour. Nothing could have worked better than the machinery employed, and the uncoiling apparatus answered admirably. ' Very great credit for these arrangements is due to Mr. F. C. Webb, who was Mr. Clark's assistant from the commencement of the cable manufacture in the summer of 1868 until a few days before we left England in September 1869, when he unfor tunately found himself unable to accompany the expedition. His place has been well filled by Mr. Preece, who, under Mr. Clark's direction, superintended the fitting of the machinery, and most ably carried on Mr. Webb's designs. About 10 r.m. we distinguished the lights of the Ambervntch, and, five miles further on, those of a little steam cutter which had been sent forward to act as a second beacon. Lieutenant Stiffe then boarded the Dacca and assisted Captain Day in towing our paying-out vessel, the Tweed, on her proper course. The weather, for tunately, was calm: the cable came up from the tanks easily and well; the machinery worked faultlessly, and we found it practicable to let the cable run out at a pace which at one time was nearly seven knots per hour. At 11 p.m . Friday the 29tli, we had completed the Tweed's section of 240^ miles, which brought us to a point nearly south of Gais Island. After seal- M FT fVI I 1 ,v i ii 'SQUALL IN THE PERSIAN UULF. ing and buoying the end we started for our rendezvouz at Lingah, which we reached at 8 the following morning. ' The greater part of the day was occupied in removing staff, baggage, and apparatus from the Tweed to the Calcutta. . . . Before sunset the Earl Canning left for Bombay with the empty Tweed, while Lieut. Stiffe in the Amherwitch pushed on in advance for our buoy off Gais. 'Next morning, the olst, the Calcutta and Dacca left Lingah, and reached the buoy, with the Ambcrwitch alongside, about 4 p.m . Lieut. Stiffe had picked up the cable end, and, passing to him the end of that on board the Calcutta, we steamed slowly off, paying out cable in the direction of Bushahr and leaving Lieut. Stiffe to complete the joint, and catch us up during the night. By 1 a.m . of Monday, the 1st November, he was again on board the Dacca; and all went well until we had paid out 300 miles from Jask. 'Here for a time our good fortune deserted us. At 9 p.m . a terrific squall from the north-west caught us unprepared, and brought up the Dacca and Calcutta as if they had run dead on to a wall. For a few minutes confusion prevailed. The awnings and windsails were Happing about. The vessels began to go astern, and the rapidity with which a heavy sea got up was amazing. Finding that our cable was being paid out to leeward of our course, and knowing that we had none to spare, we at last reluctantly decided to cut and buoy, which was safely done when the tempest was at its highest. By this time, the Dacca, which, happily for us, proved herself a magnificently powerful vessel, had got up more steam; and our hawsers holding, she succeeded in bringing our heads to the wind, and steered for the lee of the Persian shore. The steam barge which had been towing alongside the Dacca cut herself adrift, and great fears were entertained for her safety and that of her crew. Marvellous to relate, she was able to keep her head to sea, and though nearly swamped w r as picked up next morning by the Ambcrwitch. The little steam cutter was less lucky : her painter, while being passed astern the Amberwitch, was fouled by the vessel's propeller, and the boat capsized and B B3T0 TELEGRAm AND Tit A TEL. [chap. had to be cut adrift. Happily the three men on board were all saved. ' By 3 a.m . of the 2nd November, the gale had subsided, and by 6, the sea calming as suddenly as it rose, was nearly smooth. We returned to our buoy, and the operation of splicing was again carried out on board the Amhcrwitch. Leaving her to com plete her task, we once more commenced paying out in the direction of Bushahr. At 4 p.m . we encountered a second violent gale, almost as violent as that of the previous night. For this we were, however, prepared, and the Dacca, with full steam up, succeeded in towing our huge ship in the very teeth of the wind, at from one to two knots an hour. ' A more awful thunderstorm than that through which we passed can scarcely be pictured. The lightning struck our vessel, but did no damage ; and by 7 or 8 p.m . the immediate fury of the tempest was over. The wind, however, continued exces sively high, and at 9 o'clock a third squall, less violent than its predecessors, prevented the waves subsiding for many hours. The pitching of the Calcutta of course brought a fearfully heavy strain to bear upon our cable, and our anxiety on this account during the gale was great. Not an accident of any kind occurred. Had our hawsers parted, or had we been in tow of a less powerful ship than the Dacca, the loss of cable and loss of time would have been most serious. . . . ' Before sunset on the 3rd November we buoyed the end of our cable off Bushahr, having paid out 490^ miles since starting from Jask, and leaving about twelve miles to Bushahr to be covered by shore end and tapers. The Amhencitch with the steam barge came up to our anchorage soon after dark, and the next three days we were busily engaged submerging the shore end, which had to be carefully laid clear of the original line.' ' On the evening of the 6tli November,' adds the writer, naturally pleased at so successful a result of anxious labour, everything was complete, and Bushahr in full communication with Jask by the new as well asvi.] PRESS TEL E&lt;1 HA MS. 871 by the old cable. 1 We left Bushahr for Bombay at half- past 10 in the morning of Sunday, the 7th instant.' To this detailed narrative of operations was added a favourable report of the India-rubber cable, which, according to Mr. Latimer Clark, gave the most won derful insulation, and had been laid without the smallest indication of a fault. Acknowledgment was made, in conclusion, of the ser vices rendered by the officers connected with the cable expedition. Mr. Latimer Clark's widely recognized energy and abilities had been evidenced by the success that had attended his plans ; and his very cordial co operation with the Assistant Director was in like manner prominently noticed. Mr. George Preece and Mr. Her- 1 Telegraphic reports of this important but little-noised operation were received in England. On the 27th a telegram from Tehran announced that the Calcutta, Amberwitch, and other vessels, had reached Jask the day previous, and that the operation of paying out cable would commence on the day following. It added, ' Cable perfect: weather magnificent; all in good health.' Other telegrams may be recorded agreeably to dates :— 'October 28 ; 2.5 p.m.— Tweed off Masandam Thursday morning, 9 : sixty- seven miles cable submerged : tests perfect ; all well.

[chap. bert Taylor, of Mr. Clark's staff, had also rendered good service, the first by his foresight and admirable manage ment, the second by his care and attention to testing. The skill and activity of Lieutenant Stiffe, LN., had been conspicuous throughout: the greatest credit was due to him for the course laid down, and for the efficient manner in which the cable ends were picked up, and joints made on board the Amherwitck. Captains Day of the Dacca, Tolputt of the Earl Canning, Stuart of the Tweed, and Maxwell of the Calcutta, had rendered willing aid on all occasions ; and Mr. Hirz, electrician, Mr. Mance and Captain Gabler, superintendents, and Mr, Possman, together with the staff of signallers engaged, as well as Mr. Melhuish, a volunteer from the Indian telegraphs, and Mr. Aspinall, the secretary and accountant, had all merited favourable mention. To Captain Robinson, Superintendent of Bombay Marine, Major Champain expressed his sense of obligation for ' ready and zealous aid rendered from first to last by himself and the department under his control.' We have already shown that the second wire of the land-line in Persia had been more or less completed in June 1867. To strengthen the communications in that country, and meet the probable increase of traffic from the Russian side, a third wire was then further projected, extending from Tehran to Bushahr, but the proposal remained for some time under consideration. The land- line from Gwadar to Jask had been completed on the 15th August, 1869, or from two to three months before the cable was laid ; and the successful accomplishment of the latest operation supplied a double line of commu nication for the whole way between Karachi to Bushahr; from which port to London, and vice versd, were twovi.] MAKRAN COAST LIME. 373 grand alternative lines, one via Tehran and Kussia, the other vid Baghdad and Constantinople. Little has been said of the Makran coast land-lines, ^et then consti notion was a matter involving mental anxiety and powers of organization, with physical labour and endurance of no common kind. To Mr. H. kaak Walton and his able and energetic assistants belongs the main credit of carrying out the line from Karachi to Gwadar, under the protective arrangements made with the local chiefs in 1861-62 by Major Goldsmid, and confirmed by the Indian Government. 1 This work was commenced in 1862, and continued, under extraordinary physical and political difficulties, until completion in May 1863. One great feature in the line is the passage of the wires over the Malan cliff, regarding which sec tion, Colonel Stewart thought it might be advisable to resort to a short sea cable, but which Mr. AValton re solved to surmount by a long and bold span. This plan had already suggested itself to Mr. Ryland, who accom panied Major Goldsmid, but the latter officer had inclined to the submarine alternative. 2 Mr. Walton has described this and other parts of his laborious task in official and non-official form. We quote from a letter already printed, but which may have escaped the notice of some readers of these pages :— ^ou can imagine the work it has been, getting tons of iron posts and wire up the Malan, over 2,000 measured feet in height 1 See Part II.

I found a valley called the Slmm . . my best route, bearing in mind my settled determination to span the eastern face. Over a mile and a half of most difficult hills between the Shum valley and Malan Bay, the line runs along to the foot of the eastern precipice. The exact height of the drop here is 1,620 feet, and it is taken over the level plain at the top, to the back of the Xlior Bat valley.. Up the rock at this point I cut a road, over which material was brought by manual labour—no easy job, considering each post weighs over 2 cwt., and each mile of double wire 12 cwt. at least. Then—down the Khor Bat valley and along the seaside to Manhaji, which is spanned by masts close to its mouth. Thence in a north-west direction, in order to cross the Gorhad at a narrow place five miles inland, and keep ing the line about that distance from the sea, and to the north of your route, we strike down the isthmus into Or in am on the western side, in order to avoid the drift sand-hills. . . After continuing a description of the line up to Gwadar, Mr. Walton adds :— ' I need not tell you of the physical difficulties of the country we have come through. The want of water in many places has driven us to endure great hardships. A body of 25 Europeans, and 600 natives passing through this utterly barren country, must expect to meet with very great difficulties. Often I have been obliged to prohibit ablutions of any kind, and to place guards, with drawn swords, over dirty puddles . . . From Karachi the double line is completed, and working to Shor Kandi, and from Pasni to the Karwat Pass ; it will he entirely finished by the end of this month. Both Europeans and natives have throughout behaved excellently, and by enforcing the strictest discipline, I have now nearly got through the en terprise without a grumble. Of course, all had to be fed from Karachi; and the posts being all of iron, brought from England, were distributed eighteen to the mile, and required many camels, which were likewise almost entirely supplied with provender from Karachi. We are all exhausted, and glad our labours areHARD AND hot WORK. 375 near an end, as the hot weather lias again set in, and many deaths are occurring among the natives ...' 1 Six years had scarcely elapsed from the completion of the line along the Makran coast, from Karachi to Gvvadar, when a second line was commenced in pro longation to the westward, the terminus of which was Jask. Its length was estimated at 329^ miles. Mr. Walker, the superintendent, on whom devolved the main labour of personal and detailed supervision, performed his task with zeal and ability. The country to be traversed was, according to his report, in parts composed of high and irregular hills, rivers which as a rule were not to be readily spanned, deleterious saltpetre marshes, and impracticable rocky ground; and on this account it was no simple matter to mark out a suitable course. The work of construction, however, once beo-un 9 j o y the first 115 miles to Charbar, the single intervening station on the road from Gwadar to Jask, w r ere covered in twenty-six days, despite of thirty miles of rocky ground and ten of puzzling hills. The remainder of the distance, or nearly two-thirds of the whole way, presented much level ground, but the necessity of avoiding marsh and saltpetre forced the working par ties towards harder soil, rock, and low hills. In some cases it became imperative to blast holes and build up the standards in masonry. 2 ' The weather,' wrote Mr. talker, 'had become intensely hot, frequently ranging as high as 156° on the work and 128' under canvas.

The question of water supply for 400 men, which from the first was of great moment, assumed a serious and embarrassing shape. It was perplexing to move od four camps over parts where water was only to be had at distances of from twelve to twenty-four miles; \\ liil.st we could work at the most in the hard ground four miles per day.' Delays in progress were mainly ascribed to the great mortality which occurred among the contractor's camels, and the want of others to replace them. The route from Charbar to Jask was icpoited strewn with the dead and dying animals engaged in the distribution of the telegraph material, and succumbing to the fierce heat. One gratifying cncumstance was the maintenance of good relations with the natives, notwithstanding provocations on their part in the way ot exactions and general troublesome- ness, Mr. Walker, in concluding his report, spoke iu the highest terms of the construction staff, and especially Messrs. 1 ossman, Scroggie, and Stranack, from whom he received zealous and efficient assistance. 1 W hen Major C ham pain reached Paris on his way to bom bay, and not a month before the sad accident which befell the Camatic in the Gulf of Suez, he was met there by Colonel Goldsmid, on his return from a visit to certain continental cities. The object of his new tour may be briefly explained. 1 Superintendent's Report, No. 68 of August 26, 1869, to the Director Makran Coast and Submarine Telegraph ; copy enclosed in the Director's Report to Secretary to Government, Bombay, No. 802 of the 31st idem. It was recommended to the favourable consideration of the British Government that ' all who worked between Gwadar and Jask should receive one month's pay, and those engaged between Gwadar and Charbar half a month's, as gratuity,' and the Bombay Government forwarded it, with their strong sup port, to the Government of India ; but for reasons assigned the Governor- General in ( ouncil was unable to accede to the recommendation.VI.] STATEMENTS OF EUROPEAN ADMINISTRATIONS. 377 While in Bombay at the commencement of 1859. the complaints of the mercantile community, and his own observations on the irregularity, delays, and inaccura cies still occurring m Anglo-Indian correspondence, had induced the Chief Director to move his representative at home formally to address the States concerned, parties to the International Congress of Vienna; and the latter otiicer had proceeded upon this information, to repeat a remonstrance which he had already put forward in a similar sense on his own responsibility. After some interchange of letters, the Director of the telegraph office at Berne, who had been nominated at the \ icnna conference a kind of general referee or secretary in such matters, took action upon Major tliampains appeal, in a suitable manner^but Colonel Uldsmid, on revisiting Constantinople later in the year finding the complaints of the Indian public more urgent than before, submitted a new memorandum on^he subject to her Majesty's Ambassador at the Porte Later again, or in July 1869, the Berne office supplied ' ''formation on the proceedings taken. Seventeen ministrations had been addressed by circular, of whom on y three, namely, Roumania, Persia, and Servia, had tailed to send replies. Of the fourteen communications leceivcd those of Russia, France, Switzerland, Austria, and iurkey, alone require present notice. Russia, while declaring that the necessary measures wc een taken to remedy, as much as possible, the specified irregularities, brought to mind that ' the con struction on Russian territory of a special line with two r^s, solel y intended for Indian correspondence, ,, was ljei ng successfully carried out. France, Switzerland, Austria, and Turkey, made378 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. mention of the arrangements concluded on the 22iid July, 18G8, in Vienna, for the establishment of direct communication between London, Paris, Vienna, Con stantinople, and India: the first to certify that they had executed all the engagements accepted by them on this behalf; and Turkey to announce that her con templated lines were in course of construction and would be shortly completed. Turkey, moreover, in asserting the reforms she had effected in her telegraph service, threw the blame of the defects complained of in many instances on other administrations than her own. Austria notified that a conference of the delegates of the Austro-Hungarian, Servian, and Ottoman administra tions was abc^it assembling at Semlin ' to open an inquiry into the progress of Indo-European telegraphic corre spondence, and regulate the service on the international line in the countries represented at the conference.' Finally, Italy, noting the care with which she had established and organized her international lines, stated that ' negotiations had been entered upon between the Italian, Turkish, and French Governments, to devote to the Indo-European service a special wire throughout the three States.' 1 On the 13th August, Colonel Goldsmid left London, on a short and somewhat rapid tour, to bring personal inquiry and personal effort to bear upon the whole question. A year had passed since the Vienna conference, and there had been ample time afforded for the promised ameliorations of the service. He visited Brussels, the 1 Letter and Enclosure from Chief Director Government Indo -European telegraph.

[chap. through Turkey by all available means. Independently of the unanimously expressed desire of the States, parties to the \ ienna Convention, to aid her Majesty's Government in this respect, France has signed a separate convention with Austria, Switzer land, Servia, and Turkey; and is now negotiating a second with Italy and Turkey for the same specific object. The first of these conventions was to have had effect from October last, but the Turkish Administration does not appear to have yet completed its part of the intended programme. The second is to have effect from the 1st May next. It is to be hoped that there will not then be a like failure of fulfilment by one contracting party. Meanwhile our best line of communication appears to be through Belgium or Holland to Frankfort, Vienna, and Constantinople.' The report concluded with a proposal to address the foreign administrations through the ordinaly diplo matic channels; ' In the Vienna Convention were laid down eight routes for Indo -European messages. Of these five passed through Western Europe and the ' Indo-Ottoman' lines; three through Kussia, Persia, and the ' Eusso-Tersian ' lines. The States directly concerned in the transmission of messages passing between England and India by these eight routes, are— France, Belgium, Holland, Prussia (comprising northern Germany), Kussia, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, and Turkey. ' Russia alone is unconcerned in any traffic by the ' Indo- Ottoman' lines. As a rule, she would receive telegrams through Persia only.' 1 It was submitted that her Majesty's representatives at the courts here mentioned be made acquainted with the circumstances of the case, in order that, should occasion offer, diplomatic aid be affoided in certain practical ways indicated. And one point in the Chief Director's mind seemed to merit particular attention : 1 Colonel Goldsmid to the Under Secretary of State for India.VI.] A XTICIPA TED RES U L TS. 381 ' Mr. Siemens is shortly about to open his Russo-Persian line, and a cable is to be laid in the Red Sea. Unless the Ottoman Administration act np to the spirit of its conven tion, there is little doubt that Indian traffic will soon flow in another direction from that hitherto unwillingly but neces sarily taken. Such results will at all events not have been brought about by any action on the part of her Majesty's Government, whose officers have ever been ready, and are now ready, to lend assistance towards perfecting the condition of the Ottoman lines of telegraph to India.' The remainder of the year 1869, and the first two months of 1870, were fully occupied with questions of economy and finance. Political preliminaries had been well nigh exhausted; the telegraph posts and wires from England to India had been put into a regular system, and section by section had an intel ligible organization through two distinct lines ranging from London to Karachi: as regards directing agencies no better course could be pursued than to rest awhile upon oars exercised without remission for some five years. The great object now in view, decrease of expenditure, was to be attained rather in watching the progress of reforms and innovations actually in troduced, or about to spring into existence, than in devising new ones. Therefore had one of the Chief Director's first proposals been the abolition of his own appointment, and that his Assistant should undertake the whole charge single-handed. The proposal was to be experimental for a year, during which period the proposer would avail himself of the furlough regu lations to enjoy lelaxation from official work. Three months had not elapsed of this leave when Colonel Goldsmid was nominated to the charge of a politicalTELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. IHia, mission of twofold character, the duration of which might be for years; 1 and at Stockholm in September, while en route for Persia, he tendered resignation of his telegraph directorship. But there was another rea son for watching progress and pausing in the work of active reform. The Red Sea cable was about to open traffic in opposition to the Turkish lines and recently constructed Indo-European telegraph of the Messrs. Siemens ; and a very few months would prove whether competition was under the circumstances pos sible, or whether those writers in the press who passed a wholesale condemnation on the Government measures were true prophets. It were an invidious, and happily a needless task to repeat the many statements so freely circulated to the detriment of the Persian Gulf and Makran coast lines, and the replies equally ready to be given, but more charily published, on the part of Government officers. Allusion is made especially to the period of the first promulgation of the prospectus of the British Indian submarine telegraph. Time has now sufficiently proved that the channels through which Government was endeavouring to 'force telegraphic communica tion ' were not ' as difficult as the world can produce; and that the measures which have resulted in the splendid lines now existing between England and India were not by any means apt illustrations of a virtual trial of ' the impossible,' followed by ' matters- 1 The settlement of the Turco-Persian frontier question was, for example, authoritatively commenced, it is believed, hy H.M.

Yet this was the first of a series of charges brought against those who sanctioned both labour and expenditure on the objects we have sought, however feebly, to express in the present volume. For the remainder, reference is solicited to the columns of the daily papers throughout the year 18G9 and up to March 1870, when the Viceroy and Governor of Bombay added their own personal felicitations to the congratulatory telegrams with which the chairman of the British India Submarine Company was greeted on the success ful accomplishment of his work. 1 There are two points in these attacks upon Govern ment work which may be briefly noticed. In so doing all intent is disclaimed at reviving an undesired dis cussion. The question is propounded in a general, rather than particular sense. Firstly, it is assuredly an illogical and an unsound theory to maintain that Government is fair game for depreciation and invective because it is more commonly pictured in a collective than an indi vidual form. Some one person or some two or three persons must be responsible and should be held respon sible for certain acts, whether they be shielded with the segis of the State, or open to criticism and censure as an immoral play or a street obstruction. With ministers and high officials, this personal responsibility is more or less acknowledged : not so, however, with humbler The few strong expressions quoted from the public press in this para graph will show that specific instances are not wanting in illustration of the feeling indicated ; though these are mild indeed compared with some of the c larger adduced. On the other hand, what better 2&gt;roof of impartial action could be found than the fact, that Government publicly congratulated the ompanies on those submarine telegraph achievements which met with merited app ause and honour in all quarters ; while sea-cables were laid and land- •ne obstacles surmounted by their own officers in comparative silence ?384 TELEGRAPH AND TEA VEL. [chap. workmen. These tire doomed, to hear patiently tlieir work vilified and run down, because tliey have neither the status to be publicly responsible, nor the liberty of speaking as they would wish to speak on behalf of those they serve. Surely, if Government cannot ap prove the exercise of greater license to their servants — and the wisdom of this course is in no way impugned— it is but just that those who publicly attack Govern ment measures and know the men who recommend and execute, should name the one as well as condemn the other. Fair play in these matters is not only desirable on the score of ordinary morality, but to hasten the time when individual work and individual efficiency shall be tested and certified in every depart ment of Administration ; when the question of cost shall no longer be the gravest consideration for parliamentary commissions, but the question of return for cost: when a vague desire for reduction of salary shall be substituted by a firm exaction of an equivalent to salary ; in fine, when abstract ideas about Govern ment offices and administration shall give place to definite truths. Secondly, no reasoning can modify the application to Government of the code of honour which prevails between man and man. A contractor has no more right to saddle the State with an iniquitous money burthen than in the case of a private individual: noi has a tradesman any more moral warrant to sell bad wares to his country than to his countrymen, or than a Government servant has to submit an undue claim, because it can be compressed within the literal meaning of a regulation. Upon this principle, therefore, does it behove the officers of Government, individuall}, to l'- 1vi.] CONCL U1JING S UMMAIIY. jealous of the interests as of the honour of their masters, and they are in duty bound to protect the one and the other to the utmost of their limited powers. If attacked in print, they should be attacked in a way to which they can readily respond, and as much facility is due to the circulation of their answers as to the charges which have rendered those responses necessary. The summary of work performed since March 1870 to the close of 1873 will be an appropriate conclusion to the narrative of the telegraph.' The Siemens' line from London to Tehran, joining the Persian line at the latter city, under the supervision and management of British officers, as far as Bushahr where it meets the British Government cable, fairly opened on the 31st January, 1870. I he Red Sea cable commenced work on the 2Gth March following; but the Falmouth- Gibraltar section, without which the Aden line is practically imperfect, was not completed till the 13th June. In merely' chronicling this latter achievement according to the letter of our task, we have no desire to depreciate its importance. A great and successful undertaking of the kind, replete with personal as with public interests, cannot fail to command graphic de scription equally with a world-wide laudation ; and in this particular instance all that had to be promulgated on t tlie subject has long since become matter of record. Later in the same year Major Champain again pro ceeded to Persia. His chief reasons were to inspect the line, to judge for himself of the necessity of replacing the old wooden poles by iron standards, and last, not 1 tor the official details contained in the remainder of this chapter, I am ( ioHy indebted to a memorandum kindly prepared for me by Major J.

[chap. least, endeavour by every possible means to curtail the working and maintenance establishments. After a march with Captain St. John in the depth of winter from Tehran to Bushahr, he continued his journey to India, there to give in his report upon the Persian line, and recommendations for future action. In June, 1871, he returned by the overland route, and in September, attended, in company with Colonel Robinson, R.E., the Indian Director-General, a meeting at Berne to consider the question of rival companies or organizations working the lines to India. The service had greatly improved, but the traffic proved too inelastic for three lines; and it seemed highly probable that, at the low rates then in force, the two companies would be obliged to withdraw, leaving the Turkish line, which was supported almost entirely by Imperial resources, to fall back, perhaps, to its old state of inefficiency. The result was an unavoidable increase in the charge from the 2/. 17^. fixed by the Congress of Vienna, to il. 105., or about the original tariff. In November, Colonel Robinson and Major Champain were nominated by the Indian Government as delegates to the triennial Tele graph Conference of States interested, held this year in Rome. The latter officer was, moreover, authorized to represent Persia on the same occasion. Among other questions considered was that of tariff, and the 4/. 105. message of twenty words was modified to 4/. In June, 1872, Major Champain again repaired to Persia, via the Caspian, to renew the treaty which expired in the autumn. He was detained there until the 5th December, when he returned, by the Caucasus, with a new Convention to last for twenty-three years, or the full period of the Siemens' concession. This Conventionvi.j LATEST PERSIAN CONVENTION. 387 was subsequently approved by her Majesty's Govern ment, and ratifications were formally exchanged at Tehran on the 31st March, 1873. The articles are twenty in number, and definitively lay down the terms on which the international traffic is in future to be worked, the system on which accounts are to be settled, the duties and responsibilities of the English staff employed in the country, and the protection to be accorded them by the Persian authorities. In March, 1873, the Chief Director started once more for India, to discuss and settle with the Indian Govern ment many questions affecting the general administration of Persian and Persian Gulf lines. Returning to Lon don in August, he proceeded the next month, with Mr. Cappel of the Indian Department, to Vienna, there to consider, with the Russian and Prussian Directors-General, the possibility of reducing the standard of twenty words for telegraphic messages. The result of this minor con ference was a reduction, from the 15th November, 1873, of a standard of twenty words at 100 francs, to one of ten words at 50 francs, with regular gradations of prices for each word over ten. And the increase of traffic fol lowing the reduction proved, i.e. for the month suc ceeding its operation, most encouraging. The speed and accuracy of working, both vid Tehran and via Suez, are now acknowledged, and, as a rule, ically leave little to be desired. But although matched in efficiency, the Company's cables have hitherto enjoyed the greater patronage of the public. And reasons for this preference seem readily to present themselves. Let us take two of the more palpable. Imprimis, the different companies between England and India by the Mediterranean and Red Sea having c c 2388 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. amalgamated, are better able to advertise and bring their merits to notice than the Indo-European telegraph, which is half in the hands of a company, and half in those of Government. Secondly, the Eastern line, which works in connection with the trans-Indian Cable Companies, has a practical monopoly of the messages from Singapore, China, &amp;c., which in former days had to be posted to Galle and were thence telegraphed by the Persian Gulf. As it will be impracticable to prolong the present account a day longer than the close of the year 1873, we publish, in bringing this portion of our volume to an end, a table showing the yearly progress of the telegraph working by Turkey and Russia, both, from the first to the latest registries. It would manifestly be unfair to take the pace vid Russia, from 1865 to 18G9, as a sample of international working, because the line was not an organized one, and very few messages passed by it. Turkey had, on the other hand, been much encouraged, and yet—while showing by occasional flashes of improvement how well she could work— her average rate was nearly as bad in 1869 as when the wires were first laid. Since 1870, the improvement in the Turkish lines must be attributed to greater attention having at length been effectually given to the lines between London and Constantinople, and also to the comparatively trivial traffic in this direction ; the bulk of the messages naturally being conveyed via Suez or vid Tehran. 'Three hours, nine minutes,' truly says Major Champain, *' is a particularly good average rate of speed when one remembers what countries and seas are traversed by the Indo-European despatches, and howvi.] SPEED OF WORKING. 389 any important interruption affects the calculation.

In the Introductory Chapter 1 we proposed to show a kind of profit and loss account for the Cis-India Telegraphs of Government. As regards political and commercial value, it may be permitted us, perhaps, to ask the reader of these pages to add the details herein contained to the more palpable and general data he must already possess, and the conclusions he may already have arrived at, before pronouncing a final judgment.

Baghdad , the City of the Khalifs, notwithstanding its pleasant associations for reading, romantic boyhood, is comparatively but little known to full-grown Englishmen in its reality. It may be that we liked the place as boys, owing to the kind of fairy inconceivableness with which it was invested ; and that its khalifs, wazirs, princes, princesses, merchants, barbers, and many dra matis f)erson(B, charmed us as much by their brilliant unsubstantiality as by their acts and words. Now that age has blunted our enjoyment of theatrical display and Oriental romance, we do not care to acquaint ourselves with an existent Baghdad ; and we are just as indifferent in asking whether the favoured city of the ' Arabian Mghts' is really Baghdad at all, and not Cairo which it more resembles, as whether it is situated in Turkey or Persia. Here, for the benefit of the uninitiated, let the opportunity be taken to place on record the fact that Baghdad is not, and has not been Persian for more than two centuries. It is the capital of one of the finest dependencies of the Ottoman Empire, won for them bym ■ • • i' TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. tlic young, but fierce and I'esolute Sultan Murad, or Amurath IV., in 1G38, shortly before his death. 1 In these matter-of-fact practical times, the simpler way for the European traveller to reach Baghdad is by em barking at Bombay in a steamer of the British India Company, and proceeding up the Persian Gulf to Basrah. Thence to Baghdad up the Tigris may be readily accom plished by Turkish or English river steamer in four or five days. The city of dates is rather nominal than real in this programme ; for the coaling station off which lie the British boats, and where passengers land and loiter, is Margil, a very few miles higher up than the creek leading to Basrah from the Shatt-el-Arab. A Vice-Consul, or Assistant British Resident, hoists his colours here, and is under the orders of her Majesty's Consul-General at Baghdad. His dwelling-house is pleasantly situated by the river-side. A brick, single- storied building, with tolerably thick walls and the usual Indian verandah, it is not ill adapted to the fierce heat of at least half the year: but it seems to want the ap pliances of the Indian bungalow, such as the punkah and thermantidotes. That part of the year is, fortunately, of a milder character, may be gathered from the existence in this house of a handsome, English-looking fireplace, with mantelpiece complete, the effect of which is both refreshing and ornamental. There is something genial in a fireplace in the far East, though we may never chance to see a fire lighted in it. The kind host who received me on two distinct occasions at his Margil residence now rests for ever in those distant lands. He was one of those to make his presence felt in such manner that his absence would be, as it is, regretted.

In this neighbourhood is a monument erected by Sir R. Grant, once Governor of Bombay, and others, to the memory of officers and men lost by the foundering of the Tigris, in Colonel Chesney's expedition in 1836. It did not strike me as kept in very good order, nor is it more than an ordinary tablet in memoriam : but the subject is worthy a respectable commemoration. Colonel Chesney and Captain l &gt;losse Lynch were of those who survived ; a brother of the latter, an officer in the Bombay army, was among those who perished. Hie first object of interest, to the traveller moving up by boat from Margil to Baghdad, is the point of junction of the Tigris and Euphrates, just above which, on the latter river, is Korna, alleged to be the site of the Garden of Eden. Here are some scattered mat and mud hovels exceedingly dirty, trees and vegetation, a leaning minaret, and little else to attract attention. Somewhat higher up the river is a bank of gardens; and here I was ortunate enough to see realized a charming picture of Mesopotamian village life and scenery, the bright green proc uce of the soil forming an agreeable contrast to the &gt;ro\vn 3 orange, and magenta dresses of the women movino- through it. Higher still are the Marshes, a vast flat, many long miles in extent on either side, studded, how ever, with green wheat cultivation.

More pig shoot ing yesterday. One large sow was killed by B., a smaller animal by Captain S.; others may have fallen which were not recovered. Sport resumed this morning. River becomes very winding, and presents, moreover, many sharp angles and turn ings. Villages occasionally seen ; some of great length, but all apparently of a locomotive character. Population sparse, as also cultivation ; and yet how rich must be the neglected soil! Cattle abundant, especially buffaloes; sheep also in plenty. The cows are not in good condition, a result attributed to the purging properties of new grass, rather than any normal im perfection ; and last winter, in its severity, was injurious to the pasture. Observed many tents, and took special note of Pro fessor Eawlinson's ' reed cabins, supported by the tall stems of the growing plants bent into arches, and walled with mats composed of flags or sedge.' An Arab chief came on board the steamer. He is said to be the son of a ci-devant rebel of repute, who long resisted the Turkish authorities. He himself now professes great loyalty, and wears the European coat and trousers like the Osmanli. No dress, in my humble opinion, could be less becoming to the character, habits, and bearing of the well-born Arab. This chiefs features are manly and good, but the expression is unsafe. Notwithstanding his body gar ments, he wears the native ' Akal,' or rope of camels' hair, on the head, twisted around the kerchief drooping over his shoulders. The general aspect of the river to-day was that of an extensive reed marsh : water high and nearly level with the banks, and yet the channel in some places so narrow as to resemble a canal.

' Our course to-day is through country much as that of yes- 1 ci day, as regards want of population and cultivation. What are called the Marshes, however, ceased last evening on arrival at Amara, where the land became less swampy and perhaps a little higher at the banks. This said Amara is a new Turkish settlement formed at a point where the river, turning at a sharp angle to the left, is continued, as it were, to the right also, by an offshoot, called the ' Had,' which loses itself amid the marshes. Ainara is on the proper left bank, having the Tigris on one face and the Had on the other. We stopped for a moment there to drop our Arab Ottoman. It was quite interesting to see this rising Asiatic town, the house-tops crowned with curious gazers, and the Osmanli Nizams and Irregulars crowded here and there on the quay. One remarkably characteristic figure, dressed out and exhibited on the wall of his house, recalled Byron's lines : ' Begirt with many a gallant slave, Apparell'd as becomes the brave, Old Giaffir sate in his Divan.' There was a fair English-looking boy at his side; nor should the ladies of the tableau be forgotten. Api lJ 1 i. lliis morning, at about half-past seven, reached Kut-al-Amara, a wood station, with a Turkish detachment of 300 men under a Mir Alai (Colonel). Strolled on shore, and conversed with soldiers and others. Regiments composed of Arabs as Mell as Turks, and the dresses are of several shades and varieties of slovenliness. The Sultan's representative here is not fond of pipe-clay at all events. Had just entered a court- yaid oi bailack-square, where some hundred men might have been huddled into eight or ten small pale-green tents, and was watching the soldiers at drill, when S. and A. joined me. We were invited to visit the Mir Alai, and proceeded up stairs to a reception-room, not much better than that of a native pleader in India. It overlooked the drill-ground in the court of the -whole building. W e were ushered in and seated on a sofa. Soon came a portly lurk, probably a Binbashi (Major), whoKUT-AL-AMARA. talked fair Persian, and with whom we got on comfortably enough. Then appeared the great man himself: he could hardly speak any language but his own, and my Turkish was, perhaps, no better than his Arabic. However, we managed among us to keep up the conversation. We had two instalments of coffee, after which I proposed departure, but our friend begged we would inspect the troops in the ground outside the building This we agreed to do, for there was no resisting the pressure used. There were the men on one side, leaping and performing certain antics meant to illustrate the new bayonet exercise—a strange operation at any time, and by soldiers of any nationality, but made particularly so by these quaint handlers of old flint muskets: on the other side, they were going through the manual and platoon exercise in small squads. Some of the old Turkish Colonel's sayings may be recorded. Though not very clean in person, he was pleasant in his hearty joviality, and his sentiments were of the most friendly description : ' The Daolat 1 Ingliz (English Government) was all one with the Daolat Osmanli (Turkish Government). All that he possessed was ours, and vice versa.' Again : ' In ten years more, under Sultan Abdul Aziz, there must be a great change in Turkey. She will have progressed incredibly. At such time her civilization will be complete and of the first order; she will possess the best of shops, manufactories (fabricas), all.' Then, in special allusion, per laps, to C, to whom he was vainly endeavouring to make himself intelligible: 'How good would it be if we could only but understand one another!' The place was foul and nithy, and the parade-ground in wretched order.

' April 18.—Passed a new-looking fort and village, called Gubba, or Azizya, a station for a Kaimakam (Lieutenant-Colonel); bnt apparently uninhabited, owing to the high state of the river, which overflows its banks here as elsewhere. We might have walked over to the wood station,' Homaniyah wall,' in, perhaps, ten minutes, from a point in the Tigris whence, owing to the most tortuous of courses, it took us about two hours to steam there. VTe landed when replenishing fuel ; and C. and I inspected some mounds like tumuli. These are damp and soft, and the impress of feet upon them is whitened with saltpetre, while the lower ground is quite dry. They are covered, moreover, with broken pottery and bricks. The last showed an arrow- shaped mark, which Colonel S. thinks must have some meaning. Pretty wild birds and pretty wild flowers visible. More shooting to-day, the pig being varied with wild cats. Saw P&gt;aghdadya in the distance, said to be a favourite resort of lions. An Arab at the wood station assured S. that a lion was in the habit of paying nightly visits in his locality, and that he had fenced himself in for protection. These lions, if worthy the name, must be small and inferior; for this country shows no forest or cover, in accordance with our notions of the residence of the king of beasts, I almost question whether some, perhaps all, are not lynxes. In any case, great excitement prevails, and sport is contemplated on a future occasion.

Near it is a domed building called Sulman Pak, supposed to be the tomb of the prophet's barber; but these Muhammadan legends are too common to be trusted, and are in most cases either perversions of ancient tradition, or applied to comparatively modern structures with out historical interest. Owing to the overflow of the river and consequent intervention of a canal, our approach to Ctesiphou was interrupted, nor could we get within some 400 yards of this really beautiful and interesting relic of Parthian magnificence. Of Seleucia, on the opposite side of the Tigris, the remains are probably centered in two mounds known to the inhabitants as Tel Omar and Sirhan, the first of which was opened by Mr. John Taylor, her Majesty's Consul for Kurdistan. 1 On returning to the ship we were followed by a party of town Arabs who had been on a pilgrimage to the Sulman Pak, and who were inclined to be communicative. There had also been a larger party of men and women from Baghdad whose tents were pitched near the tomb. ' On approaching Baghdad up the river, the country became more cultivated.

Jor eight years the river has not been known to have attained such a height. Eight years ago I am told there was a con- siderable overflow, flooding one or two villages. The golden domed mosque of the Kazimain and tomb of Zobeide no tooner appear in sight than we feel our river trip at its conclusion ; the gardens and residences along the river become part of the'city itself, the suburbs being left behind; and we quickly come to anchor near the British Residency. They say that the large house overlooking us contains the harem of a wealthy merchant. Hie ladies appear to find amusement at the windows, and no wonder. How monotonous must be the life within the walls of that blank edifice ! ' Before continuing to extract from the pages of a ( liaiy, I will say a few words on a city in which 1 passed a month on the occasion of this my first visit. It had been agreed that 1 should undertake the land inspection of the telegraph line from Baghdad to Scutaii, so that when (Jolonel Stewart and party left on the 28th April to return to India, I remained behind at the Residency, preparatory to moving in the opposite direction. 1 he sheets are narrow, dirty, gloomy and irregular; thuc is nothing about the dwelling-houses, even the best, to make them desirable, except it be the position ^hich, in some cases, combines the advantages of garden and livci. Here and there is a prettily domed mosque, but painfully like a crockery 'finjan,' or coffee cup, of blue flower pattern. Perhaps the most remarkable chaiacteiistic of the town is the large concourse of Muhammadans whether Persian, Turk, or Arab; and when to these are added the Syrian and Chaldean Christians, Jews and Armenians, it may well be con-GARDENS AT BAGHDAD. 403 ceived that the public thoroughfares are not want ing in picturesque groups and the echo of divers tongues. By far the least interesting living object is the male European, whose native dress, whatever its conve nience, has not the most remote claim to grace or beauty. The gardens, in spite of the exaggeration of Eastern poets who would lead the reader to imagine every garden a kind of terrestrial paradise, exhibit nothing in comparison to the highly-cared-for horticulture of Europe. There is a wildness and untidiness which may be very charming in their way, but which are not likely to meet with approval from the fastidious habitues of Chiswick, and like fashionable resorts, at home or abroad. Still there are flowers and shrubs meriting favourable notice, and the orange trees and pomegranates are not to be slighted. - The grounds known as ' the gardens' par excel lence, are traversed by a wide thoroughfare intersected by watercourses, roughly bridged over as in India. On either side long mud walls, with gates more or less rude or ornamented, mark the different allot ments. Some are private property, some ' Wakf' or religious bequests. But the term ' garden' is here again not according to our English dictionary. These are rather date plantations, overgrown with grass and wild vegetation, and varied with irregularly planted trees. The wood used as fuel in the river steamers is mostly, I understand, tamarisk. Good coal, at the time of which I write, w T as procurable direct from home at a cost of £2 1 Os. per ton.

[chap specimen of the style of architecture and adornment common to the better class of houses. Its front is about south-west, to the river; and the entrance door at the back is north-east, to the court. This court yard is square, and marks the harem or retired part of the house. We are on the upper floor and over look the court from a kind of terrace or verandah. On one side of me is the Resident's apartment, on the other a spare room for a guest. My room is about eighteen feet long by twelve broad, and four teen feet in height. It is built of brick, thickly coated with plaster. The wall is divided by a ledge, above and below which are recesses, the first reach ing to about a foot from the ceiling, the second descending to a point about thirty inches from the floor. The lower recesses are quaintly fashioned in the upper interior, within a generally square frame. The higher ones are regular Moorish arches set in o O similar square outlines. The ground division of the wall is ornamented with neatly designed birds and flowers and other fancy mural patterns moulded in plaster, the white colour being relieved by the blue edging. This terminates, however, just under the recesses, so that the bottom of the walls is quite plain. The ceiling division of the wall, and ceiling itself, are profusely adorned with designs of flowers in various rather dingy colours, the centre of each Moorish arch being especially favoured by a large glass cone supported on a glass crescent with a middle horn apparently extemporised for the purpose. This figure occupies the whole length of the arch, and is very conspicuous. In the centre of the ceiling, also, is a large piece of glass, a projecting figure of manyV1I .j RISE OF THE TIGRIS. 405 angular pieces like the bits of a Chinese puzzle. To the back or towards the court, however, instead of the conical figure within the arch, are three glass windows. There are windows also on the sides of the room for the use of ladies of the harem over- looking a kind of boudoir. 1 The river of Baghdad is, no doubt, the main feature of the place. An eye accustomed to the monotonous waters flowing through Sind and the Punjab; and to the clusters of houses near the banks, such as Haidarabad and Kotri, or Multan and Shir Shah ; to scenic groups, such as Sakar-Bakhar-Rohri, and the general panorama of the Lower Indus, will see little novelty in the aspect of the Tigris at this particular stage. Muddy walls and muddy waters are too much the rule, and fresh green trees and bright edifices too much the exception, to make the tout ensemble attractive ; while, even amid exceptions, there is perhaps nothing at Baghdad so unique and gem-like as Khwaja Khidhr's island above Bakhar. But the stranger from Europe will not be so fastidious in appreciation of Oriental landscape. As already stated, the river was exceptionally high in the spring of 1864, and the houses on either bank looked most insecure from aqueous intrusion; so that a visit at that season was hardly well timed for favourable impres sions. Then, walls of gardens came down occasionally with a crash ; and I had reason to believe walls of houses also. The very heavy rain may have caused these accidents as well as the river overflow ; but so it was, and so it is recorded. 1 First impressions are recorded, when the cone, as here described, had not become so constantly recurring an object to the writer as it has been during the last ten years. The word ' harem ' applies to the original native design.406 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. Her Majesty's Consul-General in 1864, with that kind hospitality which has distinguished his whole tenure of office at Baghdad, kept very much open house, open stables, and to no small extent open purse for the entertainment of his frequent guests. Always ready to arrange par ticipation in easy local ceremonial, pastime or relaxa tion of some kind, for such as were not burdened with daily routine of work, the order of the day would find variety in visiting, riding, shooting, sailing, and sight seeing. My first visit to his Excellency Namik Paslia, governor of the province, recalls a stirring scene in the court yard of the Residency. Some eight horses richly caparisoned, and a few more of less ambitious externals, but all fine spirited Arabs, were on one side waiting the pleasure of their intended riders, each horse checked and watched by an attendant groom. On the other side was a plainly saddled bay, and a stout grey pony, equipped for work, waiting the coming of the Chevalier Romulus B. and Mr. P., both bound for a ride to Tehran, vid Karmanshah, the former going tlience on a mission of patriotism and philanthropy to Bukhara, the latter to take the Caspian and Russian route to England. Our progress through the streets on that day was productive of no small stir. Guards turned out to present arms ; shopkeepers and passers by stared at each and all of us with apathetic amazement. We were ushered in, presented in due form, and got satisfactorily through the somewhat monotonous but rather interesting process of an official call. Not many days after this formal visit we 'dined with the Pasha. The dinner was abundant in products of a mixed cuisine more French than Turkish; but it savoured of error to see the Turks ranged on one side oiVII.] baghdad social gatherings. 407 the table and the European guests on the other. The champagne was drinkable; the sherry bad : all wines were passed round at a hospitable but dangerous pace. The next day a return dinner was given at the British Residency. On that occasion I sat between the Com- mander-in-Chief of the Forces and the Commandant of Artillery, the former conversing much in Turkish and the latter in Italian. My impressions of these convivial reunions is, upon the whole, favourable. True that the talk they promote is mostly superficial, and the inter change of thought and sentiment they effect is rather weak and meaningless. But then they are necessary and more or less useful. Observance of social amenities keeps individuals on better behaviour than if they never met but on official business, and makes them feel that duty to their country is inseparably allied to duty towards each other. To judge from Namik Pasha, Turkish diplomatists would seem especially reserved and dignified ; but such is not invariably the case. Nor is the Turkish Muslim regardless of distinction amid Faringis as the Indian Muslim, to whom the Englishman is the true European, and whose apprehension of every other country of Europe is of the vaguest kind. The former has a sufiicient number of conflicting European elements to deal with to be compelled, in spite of general aversions, to prefer one to the other; and in this sense England had, in 1864, no reason to complain of his avowed predilections. The little artilleryman, beside whom I sat at dinner was, however, a Hungarian, his name and title being both of official adoption. A picnic given by the hospitable Mr. and Mrs. L. afforded us more insight into the general society of Bagh dad. Diplomacy, the telegraph, commerce, medicine, and408 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

A stranger would be struck by the easy and not inharmonious blending of Oriental with European languages at these entertainments, and the fluency with which ladies speak the first, in the circles of this outlying city of a civilized world. Among other visits paid, was one to the Persian Minister at the Sublime Porte, who stayed a few days at Baghdad on his way to Constantinople.

In accordance with annual custom, the festival of the Kurban or sacri fice, falling this year on the 16th May, the Resident made then his round of early morning calls upon the native dignitaries, commencing with the Pasha. Availing myself of the opportunity of accompanying him, 1 paid my respects to the Accountant-General, the Collector of Customs, the Municipal Commissioner, and tbe Military Accountant. Colonel K.'s tact and knowledge of languages enabled him to do the conversation on these o o occasions excellently.

It need scarcely be said that pipes, coffee, and shctrhcit are essential at Baghdad as elsewhere in the East, only the visitor may exercise his discretion in selecting the Turkish chibouk or Persian kalian. The man who resists both stimulants must have the moral courage to write himself down a tolerated Goth. The mosque of the Kazimain or two Kazims; the tomb of Zobeide, of repute in the ' Arabian Nights; ' the madrasahs or colleges; the singular ruin of Aggarkuf; and the Bazar, should certainly be ' done ' by the sight seeing traveller whose star has led him to Baghdad ; and above all he should take advantage of the occasion to ride sixty miles south to Hillah, and visit the site of ancient Babylon. W ere it not that other cares and occupations had as good right to my time, I should plead guilty to great, although qualified neglect in this lespect. A large party of us steamed up the river and inspected the bright golden domes at the shrine of the Kazims : but, beyond a closer acquaintance with an object familiar in the distance; a short ride from the landing- place to the tomb and back again on a Rosinante with a deep red saddle-cover ; and the honour of tea, coffee, sugar and water, pipes, and conversations with the Muta^ali, or administrator of the sacred treasury, and some Arabs, whose fluent Hindustani was suspicious, I gained little from the excursion. The Bazar I passed and repassed as much perhaps on chance as on special occasions. Inferior to that of Constantinople, it is no doubt first class in Asia, and may be safely recom mended to afford pleasant pastime to the Oriental flaneur.410 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. The Olmrch of England service in English was per formed on Sundays in a small building capable of holding about fifty persons. Doctor E. at this time always officiated, for his brother missionary, Mr. B., was absent on a tour in Persia. These gentlemen are sent to the Jews only, and are themselves converts from Judaism. 1 hey reside here with their families, and are held in high esteem. Dr. E. is a good Arabic scholar, and showed me several versions of the Arabic Testament, one with the full punctuation which was, I think, in course of publication, and had been translated from the original Hebrew up to the book of Joshua. He informed me there were 15,000 Jews in Baghdad, but that only three Jewish children attended his school out of a total of forty-five. The instruction given was English and Arabic, geography, and moral lessons. It was difficult to secure the services of a good master and mistress, as well as meet all incidental expenses, on a limited allow ance of £30 per annum. From the number of coins and curiosities brought for # O my inspection, I should fear the market was open to the importation of fictitious antiques. Yet the eagerness evinced for excavating mounds and graves showed that the search for genuine relics was carried on with undi minished vigour. One man, I was informed, had recently been buried alive while digging into a tumulus. Colonel Kemball had found some handsome coins and earrings, and had despatched them homeward ; but the post was robbed, and all the valuables had been lost or abstracted. There were, and are probably still two posts between Baghdad and Europe : one via Damascus, Beyrout, and the Mediterranean ; one vid Diarbekir, Samsun, and Constantinople.

[chap. Having obtained all the requisite authority by telegraph from Constantinople, and by written orders from the Pasha of Bagdad, I made arrangements to start on the long journey to Scutari which lay before me. Mr. Superintendent Kersting, of the telegraph, was to be my companion for the whole way. Ahmad Efendi, an Egyptian engineer officer in the Pasha's employ, was to accompany me as far as Jazirah, or to the limit of the Baghdad jurisdiction. I had engaged for the occasion a Persian cook, a Baghdad o o ? o Christian valet, and an Arab groom ; had purchased three horses outright, and had hired mules as far as Mosul. T had invested in saddles, saddlebags, horsegear, provisions for man and beast, cooking pots, cooking and table utensils, candles, towels and every kind of necessary for the expedition ; had held con sultations and passed decisions on the nature and amount of baereraffe to be carried, and had fixed the OO O 7 day and hour of departure.

Find Ahmad Efendi waiting for o me, and after a few preliminaries we start together. The ride was all very well for a novelty, but my friend, though chatty and sociable, seemed little disposed to go out of a walk. This was wearying and unexpected. My object in starting after my com panions had been to ride the first stage fast; and how to get through 21 miles at three miles and a half an hour I knew not. The sun was hot, the conversation monotonous, and ni^ht likely to set in before we reached our destination. Induced my friend to gallop a little now and then, but he evidently did not like it, and the horsemen who attended him were ill disposed to go out of their usual pace, whatever he did. Finally we sepa rated. I overtook a stranger with horses; talked and rode on with him at a good pace for some distance; then came up with a telegraph official who took me in charge near Jadidah, the name of the first halting-place. For a long time, however, I could not trace the whereabouts of my party. My guide wished me to name a house on which to be quartered. Should it be the ' Batran's ?' This question perplexed me : for who was he that I should so use him ? Very tired, and night having set in, I at length reached a close, hot house, where our people had been bundled up, animals and all, in very tolerable proximity ; and where fleas thrived largely. Dined roughly, and enjoyed some hock immensely. Country to-day flat and desert, border ing for the most part on the river.

Again from the Diala runs the Khalis, not marked upon the map. Across a country affected by these waters the telegraph line has to shape its course from Baghdad.

A egetation scarce near the hills on the east : country stony and desert. 'May 26.—Zind, an encampment of Kurdish cultivators; 6f hours, or 20 miles. Reach telegraph line from Baiat through locust-eaten barley fields and cultivation. Follow the line over the Chai (river) of Tuz Khurmati, a village which we leave to the eastward. One man tells me that it must contain 600 houses ; another 200. I believe it to have possessed at one time the higher number, but to have suffered severely from plague. It may have revived in later years. Pass a second bntshallower mer close Ly the same place, and the Kurn Chai at some distance fuither. Alight at Dolankir, where there are huts and a running stream, and breakfast. Xear Kurn Chai is a hard, sandy plain, cracked in several places, and covered with short, dry, spare grass. Telegraph line carried along in excellent direction, but needs strengthening at the rivers with masonry pillars. 'May 27.—March to Taza Khurmati, the 'fresh date,' in opposition to Tuz Khurmati, the 'salt' or probably 'dry date :' ( hours, oi 21; miles. Cross the Tank Kuni Chai, a broad river bed, of which the right bank is about 60 feet high. At two hours is Lasan, a small ruined village with shrine of Imam Hasan, frequented by pilgrims. Taza Khurmati reached through grain-fields and over an undulating country. May contain 200 houses. Put into roomy quarters, but full of flies. May is. March to Kerkuk: hours, or 14 miles. Grain- tields and undulating country nearly the whole way. Pass Tissin to the left. Kerkuk looms out in the distance like the background of an oriental melodrama. It is just the sort of scene that would foreshadow the coming of a ferocious Pasha, lurks, Kurds, and so forth, men and women with scimitars, agitated choruses, and other conventional accompaniments. Pro ceeded to telegraph office, a tolerably extensive building, and fividently cared for. Met by the Mudir, or Superintendent, S. Ley, who received us politely in a cool, clear, airy upstairs room; and looked a friendly and comfortable Turk, without prejudices or bigotry sufficiently marked to stand in the way of his advancement at home or abroad. The face is decidedly handsome, and lights up continually with a good-humoured smile. T wo assistant Mudirs joined our party. One of these was a young exquisite in a uniform composed of the telegraph dark doth with pale blue facings, gold embroidery, and an ornament resembling a flash of forked lightning; red bagging trousers, and h \o pairs of shoes, into the inner of which passed his straps. His really delicate-looking hands were set off by an evidently pet turquoise on a pet finger.

However, Ali Chaosh had done his best, and as Ali Chaosh's father was the owner of our quarters, what was to be said ? Ilestless night, as might have been expected. ' May 29.—Halt to-day. They say there are 2,500 houses in Kerkuk, or perhaps 10,000 inhabitants, including a tenth of the number in the citadel. My servant informs me there are two Chaldsean churches, or places of worship here. Talk with the Bey and others at telegraph office. Pasha clearly not popular. Among other stories told of him, one is to the effect that he puts hundreds of prisoners into the lower rooms of the telegraph building, thus converting it into a jail. This public mode of living is distressing. To-day, Sunday, nothing but visits, even among the flies and fleas of my own apartment. There is the Telegraph Mudir, a gallant Army-Major, and an assistant-superintendent. How many chibouks are got through I know not. Eventually we adjourn to a garden full of fruit and other good things, and feast on apricots and raki! One of my new acquaintances is a Frenchified Turk, and has acquired much in Paris, besides the language, which he mistakes for progress and civilization. One glass of raki in the morning, and four in the evening; this is his quantum ; and he is sure it is necessary for his health. ' J'ai ma femme,' he says, ' ma petite fille de six mois, et mon negre, voila tout.' Young Turkey is represented by many such as this. ' May 30.—An embargo was laid on our mules yesterday. They were seized by order of the Pasha to be pressed into Government service, and, accompanied by two companies of infantry, ordered off to Sulimania, in Kurdistan. But we managed to get the mistake rectified. Marched this morning to Yarimja, 5 hours, or 16 miles; and passed a very hot day in a Kurdish tent afterwards.

In the third hour, Altun Kiupri, the Golden Bridge, a tolerably large village, with perhaps 200 houses, situated on the lesser Zab. The inhabitants, however, call the river, at this particular point, by the name of the village. The bridge is a steep ALTUN KIUPRI.420 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [(-hap, line of telegraph, and distant about four miles from the large town of Arbeil, on the post road—6 hours, or 24 miles. Hilly and undulating country, with much cultivation. Nothing can well be more graceful and beautiful than the early morning dress of rural nature in these parts. The wheat-fields are variegated with many colours, but all are pale. The wild flowers do not contrast so much as blend with the standing crops of grain: pale pink, pale blue, pale yellow, millions of charming white flowers—all these are exquisite in company with the green and hay colour of the fields. Arbeil is undoubtedly the ancient Arbela of classical history. It is a town much resembling Kerkuk, from its position on a flat-topped hill. I am told that it contains 2,000 houses, an estimate which would comprise the lower as well as higher portion. Passed, to-day, Kush Tepeh and Gul Tepeh, procuring water from a Kurdish woman at a well, and shanina from a hut at the village of Timar beyond. The Efendi sent to Arbeil for ice, which we found a great luxury. Our chaosh of to-day was a Kurd named Kadari; he was atten tive to our wants, and the tent allotted to us was pitched on a high, open, and eligible spot. 'June 2.—Karamlik to Zab Su, 4^ hours, or 20 miles, but did not cross the river till the afternoon, putting up in a tent on the left bank for the earlier part of the day. Thermometer at mid day, 107 o '8. Average heat in the shade, 96°, as recorded for eight days at different periods between 7 in the morning and 12. Yes terday it was 102° as early as 8.30.

These were in the high ground before the descent to the Zab. Ferry-boat most primitive : had to come back after the first ineffectual attempt to get over, the rudder rope breaking. The river comes down here with great force. Its deliciously cold waters are the melted snows of Kurd hills in the neighbourhood of Eovandiz. A second attempt to cross was more successful, but much time was taken up in the whole ope ration. The Efendi's horse w 7 as gallantly swam over by one ot the men. It was quite exciting to watch the struggle acrossVII.] MODERN NINEVEH. 4 2l the rapid stream, which seemed to gain power on the right, or further bank. ' June 3.—After a night passed in a tent, over which the wind whistled and moaned, make an early start, and accomplish 19 miles. Country hilly, but showing much cultivation. Sun- vise magnificent. Notwithstanding a clouded sky and appearance of rain to the north-east, day was inaugurated amid the Kurd istan hills with a grandeur defying the skill of the painter or poet to describe. The golden tints and edging, and bursting- flood of light were worthy of the highest art; but what, after all, is this, when limited to man's pigmy powers of pourtrayal ? Crossed the Kbazir Su, a smart, strong stream, whose waters, however, lacked the luxurious freshness of the Zab. They state that the two join at about 9 miles below our crossing, and How as one river into the Tigris at 18 miles lower still. This is quite a land of tumuli or tepehs, and some of them are covered to the very top with rich wheat. Hills less frequent from the Khazir Su onwards. Put up at the village of Shah Kuli. 'June 4.—March to Mosul, right bank of the Tigris, leaving the mounds of Nineveh on the left bank, together with the village of Nabi Yunus : distance about 16 miles. On crossing the ferry, find a Kavas, who escorts us to the house of Mr. Eassam, the Vice-Consul. Hospitably received in his large, comfortable, oriental house, with its marble walls, sarddbs and conveniences. A isit the Pasha and Kaim-makam commanding troops, also the telegraph office, which is a good roomy building, and the in mates of which are polite and attentive. 'June 5.—Halt at Mosul. After breakfast called on Chaldtean Patriarch, whom we found in company with the Chaldcean Metropolitan, a newly-made bishop, the Syrian bishop, and others. Sat down and conversed for some time in the Turkish lashion, or with chibouks. The scene was novel and interesting. The Chaldoean Patriarch is a handsome old man, with a benign 7 &amp; countenance, but his manner in addressing us was to me not half so pleasing as that of his companions. Two of these spoke fair French: with the rest it was necessary to use Arabic or Turkish. It appears that these churches have communication?422 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. with those of Malabar in India, and are a branch of the Romish Propaganda. Went into the church of the Miskinta (probably Arabic ' Miskinah' 1 ), who, the Syrian bishop explained to me, was supposed to be the poor widow of Saint Luke, xxi. 2; also believed, as I understood, to be a martyr. Her tomb is ex hibited. The Syrian bishop took us to his church and cathedral, two edifices of recent construction, and by no means inelegant. They are built of marble, of which the cost is here comparatively trifling, much being procurable in the neighbourhood of tlie town. The interior of the cathedral has its two aisles and altars, and is well proportioned. The centre archway and altar-piece are remarkably attractive. AVe paid the bishop a short visit at his house, where he had a nice little civilized sitting-room and inner chamber, both fitted with book-cases furnished with books. I could not but notice with pleasure that among volumes of French, Italian, and Arabic, was an English Milton. AVe held a short conversation in Italian, and my mind reverted to Eome in 1848, at which time my new acquaintance was a student there; and I well remember attending a ceremony in that par ticular year at the Propaganda, in the presence of the late Cardinal Mezzofanti. Students were reciting in fifty two dif ferent languages, and Syriac was probably one. The town of Mosul is dirty and irregular, but its Moorish doorways are agree able, as are also, standing beside them, certain figures, with au English look of the fifteenth century. Some children have hand some faces. Long talk this evening with my host, whose intimate knowledge of the Semitic tongues enables him to impart much useful information to mere ordinary Orientalists. He considers that Persian words may have crept into the Bible text and become misinterpreted from lack of punctuation; instancing that ' khamosh' may have been supposed a Hebrew word very similar in sound; through the meaning of one being ' silent, and of the other 'harnessed,' the latter interpretation would be erroneously adopted. Speaking of the Muhammadan mosque at 1 The actual word used in the latest Arabic version of the Testament in the verse noted, though not in verse 3, where, however, in English, p 0 '' r widow ' is repeated.vii.] NESTORIANS AND JACOBITES. 423 Xabi \ unus, which we had visited yesterday before crossing the river, and of the subterraneous passages inspected there, Mr. R. was ot opinion that the place must formerly have been a temple of lire worship, from the blackened appearance of the roof. ' June 6.—On going down to the breakfast-room this morning, found again the Syrian bishop. He was gentlemanly and agreeable as before, but his dress was particularly striking. I could not avoid a feeling that there was something studied and theatrical in its harmony : all was so neat and apparently so correct. Indeed, the violet garment, the black cowl with a gold cross admirably set off upon the dark ground above the fore head, and the well-dressed whiskers, beard and brows, all pre sented a picture not easily to be forgotten by a traveller recently from India. His brother came afterwards: a very different man, whose relationship destroyed much of the romance with which the first was invested. The Christians here are distinguishable by a dark turban or shawl of one colour tied round the head. Mrs. R. thinks there must be some 20,000. As the Roman Catholics call their followers Chaldaeans, to separate them from the Nestorian Christians, so do they call Syrian Christians those whom they have gained over from the Jacobites. There are two kinds of wine at Mosul, white and red. The first is palatable, and has a smack of a German or Hungarian vintage. The second I do not care for. 'June 7.—In the middle of the Tigris at Mosul is a stone bridge, or the section of a stone bridge. On either side of it flows a rapid channel. The right bank, or that on which the town stands, is connected with this construction by a bridge of boats. J hey have lately been working at a new stone structure to complete the junction on the opposite, or Nineveh bank ; but Ah Efendi, the Egyptian engineer employed on this duty, appears to have been unprovided with due materials, and the whole affair now consists of a set of incomplete arches unavail able for transit of passengers. Instead of keeping the main bne of telegraph on the left bank, and running a wire across tf ) Mosul for local purposes, the authorities have brought in alli 1 , ■■ 424 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap the wires, both from Baghdad and Constantinople, into the office at Mosul, and thus imperilled the whole communication, owing to the insecurity of the river crossing. This appears to me a grievous and unnecessary defect, and I understand that it has already been the cause of needless interruption to traffic by the wires. Start at 4.30 p.m ., after an early dinner with Mr. and Mrs. R, to whom I am indebted for the hospitality so heartily tendered. March to Tel Keif, a Chaldaean village, 3J hours, or 10 miles. Slept at top of an old house, and passed a somewhat restless night, probably on account of the high wind and rain. 'June 8.—March to Fayida, 6 hours, or 20 miles. Hilly and undulating country, fallow, ploughed, and cultivated at intervals, very dry, and swarming with locusts and insect life. Ground at times stony and steep. Grain wants strength and sub stance. Took note of fallen or damaged poles and other faults on the telegraph line here evident. Put up in something very- like a stable, where we were pestered by fleas and flies. Rain. 'June 9.—March to Girk Osman, 7 hours, or 21 miles. Pass Gerishikurt, a Christian or ' Raya' village, situated in low ground at the foot of hills. Should be approached from the northward to be seen with advantage. Built near a running stream coming down from the green fields above, and brought artificially and, with unconscious beauty, into a miniature cascade, the Degirman, or mill, is charm ingly romantic. In spite of the heat and length of the march, I could not but return to inspect the little scenic hijou in detail. From this place cross over hills with abundant pasture and ploughed fields, and grain in abundance. Pass several villages, and observe the Kurdistan ranges running from N.N.W. to S.E. Thunder-storm last night and rain to-day cool the temperature, and the change is delightful. Thermo meter on arrival in Kurdish tents, 84°, The Kurdish ladies oi Batil, a small village about half an hour before arrival, are fair for Asiatics, have an Italian look, and are undeniably handsome. The three perpendicular chin marks are characteristic, though hardly becoming. 11 1 ElL ; vvii.] A MORNING TOILET. 425 u June 10.—Girk Osman to Karola ; Kurd huts on the further side of Khabur river: 7 hours, or 22 miles: a long march, which gives us a good sunning. Country variable, from stony to pasture and cultivated ground. 1 he post-road goes off through the hills on our right towards Zakhir, while the tele graph line continues to run along their base, though not exactly parallel to them. Cross two difficult streams, the Mazra and Girkulderasi Su. Dismount and breakfast lightly, in a rustic bower of sticks and leaves, at the Kurdish village of Paibuzan, the goats loot, on the further side of a gully. After passing Deirabun Tepeh and Deirabun, we descend into the valley of the Khabur, and, following the telegraph posts through grassy, marshy, and ungenial lands, proceed up the bank for about three-quarters of an hour, when we reach the ferry. Do not admire the arrangements made here for the line. Fatiguing day for the horses, and the swim across the Khabur was no poor item of the day's w^ork for the tired brutes. 'June 11.—This morning the smart Kurdish lady in the hut, or rather her half of our hut, or tent, partitioned off by a mat about 3| feet high, rose and yawned unreservedly, then buckled on her jewels to the neck, and from the neck to the headgear, accord ing to the fashion of her country: while the dry old gentleman, whom I take to be her husband, looked less irritable than last evening, when the arrival of our escort disturbed his equanimity. I should have wished to photograph that face of the almost buxom wife with her dark disheveled hair; but my happiest remembrance of these Kurdish beauties is that of the fair plaited locks hanging down under the/ca; and how much more elegant does that small red cap so look than when on the uncombed head of a Turkish official! March to Jazirah, G| hours, or 20 miles, a town on the right bank of the Tigris, over hilly and undulating country, occasionally rich in cultivation, and abounding in grasses and wild flowers of all kinds and colours. Rejoin the post-road long before the end of the day's journey. Cross the river on a or ' raft,' some kind passengers helping my people to swim the horses. 'June 12.—Jazirah, said to be the principal city of the426 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. Chaldeans in the low country. Telegraph office here a barn, and an unsavoury one. The whole place is uninviting, hot, foul, and should be sickly. Went to inspect an ancient gate, but odour so offensive and dogs so unfriendly, that we did not achieve our purpose. Nor could I find time to go down to an old bridge which had attracted my attention on arrival, and which seemed to me a monument of a more classical age than that of the Baghdad Khalifs. The arch at the ferry looks, on the other hand, Moorish, and of the Muhammadan period. It has an Arabic inscription, which I did not decipher. ' Jave 13—Glad to leave this town and rise to the heights overlooking the river. As I am following the telegraph posts, I leave the post-road to the south, and its principal stations, Dara and Nisibin. Move now in a westerly direction; and march to-day to Azukh, G hours, about 18 miles. This is apparently a Jacobite village, with some 150 houses. On our way pass through wheat-fields, a village called Hosel, with vines and mulberry trees, and a deep stony defile, to the Kurdish village of Deshtedar, where we refresh. The kind villagers cooked us a splendid omelette and brought it in a fryingpan, with other savoury ingredients of a travelling breakfast. In return gave two pretty little Kurdish children, with red caps ornamented with silver-looking ornaments, a couple of halt kirans. On the way from Deshtedar to the stage for the day, observe a cool spring under a rock. Ram is very naturally treasured in this rather dry and stony country, and there are both open and covered tanks for the reception ot water. Occupy the house of Musa Chaosh at Azukh, and submit patiently to a succession of visits. The Matran (Metropolitan) I wished to see, but I could have dispensed with the old Turk of the scrubby beard, and perhaps, too, with the Chaldaean ot Diarbekir, who spun out their calls in an unconscionable degree. Still, both were characters, in their respective ways. Sleep in the open air to-night, and escape the torment of tleas ever ready to attend on the stranger here, 'June 14.—Azukh to Bar-saberin, 5| hours, or 16 miles. A very stony, hilly march, though not so much so as yesteida}.VII.] BAGHDAD IN RUINS. 427 My old horse down once on his knees. During the first hour pass the ruined Kurdish village of Geziris. The plateau on which we travel has a rich soil, but it is poorly cultivated. Grasses are abundant. In the third hour, reach the defile of Midda, and the village bearing that name, said to contain 100 houses. Make an incipient breakfast here much aLiainst my will. But the comical old Turk of yesterday, who is ac companying me to Mardin, says: 'Baghdad' (pointing to his stomach) ' is in ruins; we must rebuild her;' and such reason ing compels me to give in. Two huge bowls of prepared rice, milk, and shanina, are brought in for our acceptance. The old Turk and Musa Chaosh do more justice to the repast than K. or I, but this is not surprising. These Christian, or 'Raya' villages are curious. Huge irregular stones, piled one upon the other and fitting with great nicety, the larger crevices being filled with small stones: such are the walls. The roofs are of branches, sticks, beams, and leaves, on which is thrown a coating of mud; and while they enclose an apartment beneath, the same become floors to an outer sleeping site whereof the canopy is heaven. The streets are most irregular^ and the general plan of the town looks confused; but in such a wilderness of stones what order can be expected ? It is as though they had been showered down in every direction. Approaches to the village are also lined with these, in walks nsing on either side. Some of the women and children are remarkable: the first as interesting in appearance, the second for great beauty and attractiveness. On the whole, I should hope the places are thriving. Great visiting on arrival at Bar-saberin, the tower of which and adjoining house are almost church-like in the distance. Had to take to task my zahtia, or soldier, for his behaviour to the people at Midda, and told him lie should come to me for his own as for his horse's food while in my service. A Turkish soldier's comprehension is not equal to this kind of teaching; and he would have to unlearn the simplest lessons of his childhood to grasp the meaning.' It is not that the Turkish articles of war have omitted provision for cases of this nature. They are.I take advantage of this brief digression to say a few passing words on the Turkish soldier, whom I have known for many years, and who, at the time ot writing the diary under extract, was undergoing a artillery soldier, 1855-;i.

But many of those forming the complete code in 1855-6 have been, doubtless, mere formal entries disregarded in ordinary practice. The 35th applies to the present instance :— ' Whoever, attached to the army, shall in any place snatch (steal) anything from the inhabitants (Ex: in the street, or other place, he may snatch the fez from a child's head, or any person's clothes or money): if an officer, after reduction to the ranks, he shall suffer three years' mean employment in the dockyard; or if a private, he shall be put in irons and suffer three years' mean employment.' infantky sentry, 1855-6.vii.] IMPROVING CHANGES. 429 change of much importance. The attention given to the outward appearance of the ' nefer,' or ' full pri vate''' as he is more pleasantly than lucidly described in England, has been remarkably evinced since the Crimean War by the marvellous transformation of an ungainly figure, whether linesman, gunner or trooper, into a smart and well-equipped combatant. The turkish infantry, 18(&gt;9. Zouave, traceable to an excellent hint derived from the French alliance, gives perhaps the best illustra tion of this result that could be found. Without, in this place, disputing or endorsing the assertions of those champions of iurkish progress who commend generally her practical civilization, whether exhibited in financial furbishing or in army re-organization, we430 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. may confidently affirm that if the same amount of labour has been bestowed on the officering, the regular paying, and moral disciplining of the soldier as on his clothing and setting up, the Sultan's army need not fear comparison with the better forces of Europe. This change, visible to me in the garrisons below Baghdad, naturally became more apparent at Con stantinople ; and. in subsequent visits to the latter city it has become more remarkable still. 'June 15.—March to Middiat, 9 hours, or 21 miles: over very difficult country. There are stony hills covered with jungle, or dwarf scattered forests—and intersected with deep dales and gullies. Walked much on foot in order to examine more closely the telegraph line ; and glad to rest and await my companions at Chaosh Ali's leaf house, and drink a cup of his shanina. Joined by K. there, and breakfasted on bread and eggs and more shanina. Hence we rode over to the monastery, called by the Kurds Da'ir el Umr, and by Christians Mar Jibrail, near the village of Kifr Bey. Alighted, and went into the old church, said to have been built 1,500 years ago, in the days of Constantino. It is a vaulted building, about 50 feet long by 20 broad, opening out in the centre to a chapel and altar. In the church is a long stone table, the single slab being about 11 feet by 5, on which rests a prized volume of the Syrian Scrip tures. The slab shows a cleft across ; which is explained to have been the act of Taimur Lang, or Tamerlane, who robbed the jewels of the altar. A ruffianly Kurd, one Yezdan Shah, is said to have done some damage here also but a few years ago. The mosaic on the roof of the chapel and the tesselated pavement are worth inspection. At one time the monastery is said to have contained 1,000 monks, while now there are only three. Alto gether the visit was highly interesting. At Middiat I was lodged in a Jacobite house under the care of two old ladies. The Turks made a show of sending soldiers for my protection; as if a Jacobite town was not fully as safe as a Muslim one.ARRIVAL AT MARDIN. 431 Middiat is moreover, so they say, the centre of 300 towns, and head-quarters of the Mudir, or District Governor. 'June 16.— March to Kharbat Tao, called also Kharbat Jinglez and Kifr Ninek, an Arab and Kurd village: 6 hours, or 18 miles. An easy stage compared to that of yester day and the day before, and the path has almost the appear ance of a made road. The country, however, here and for miles on every side, may be described as hilly, stony, and wooded. It is continued ascent and descent, except where the turn of the valley, gully, dale, or detile, as it may chance to be called, leads in the direction of the traveller's path, at which time he commonly moves along low beds of cultivation, sepa rated one from the other by stone walls of two or three feet in height. Nothing can be richer than the soil; and the water, wherever obtained, is excellent. 'June 17.—Mardin, 7 hours or 21 miles. Pass Khar- bat-ul-Kelej, Maserte, Kharba Belik, and before the fifth hour, reach Eeshmil, a village in a deep valley, with pleasant gardens. We are led into one of these by our chaosh, who gives us a capital breakfast of rice, sweet omelette, yoghurt (clotted cream), and bread, The gardener's children and the Kahia, or head man of the village, add mulberries, cherries, and apples, to all of which we do justice. The rich soil producing these gardens, with walnut, plum, and many more fruit trees, besides innumerable flowers, is at the foot of a basin amid hard, stony hills, offshoots of Mons Masius. From Reshmil the ascents are steeper, and valleys deeper and more marked: and on one of the most remarkable of the hilly series is Mardin. The town is picturesquely situated on the slope of a conical hill, the apex of which is crowned by a remarkable and very ancient fort, having the appearance of natural rock; however supplemented in its interior appliances and resources by artificial construction. There is a very singular rock on an adjoining eminence invested with a similar defensive character. Entered the gate of the town, and rode up a dirty, steep, stony street to the telegraph office. This was about 1 p.m . ; and the sun was intensely hot and air oppressive. A cool breeze432 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. was felt as we opened out the southern aspect of the hill, and with it the magnificent view of the plains of Mesopotamia. The houses of the town are solid and comparatively good ; but there is filth and misarrangement everywhere. The building appropriated to the telegraph is small; the instruments appeared in good order: the Mudir, or Superintendent, received us in his shirt-sleeves, a costume which may have denoted a certain recklessness and independence of authority as much as a sense of climatic lassitude. This worthy was about to be removed to Khanikin, on the Turco-Persian frontier towards Baghdad, and evidently did not approve of the transfer. Doubtless it had a penal bearing ; though, primd facie, I could not admire the official wisdom which had provided a substitute at Mardin. The Efendi who had come to relieve the Bey would assuredly have foutid a place in Thackeray's ' Book,' had it treated of Turks as of Britons in the monosyllabic class. 'June 18.—Halt here to-day. Called on Mr. W., an American Missionary, who has been here for five years. He is full of information, and his amiable lady and attractive children enable him to carry on his labour of love and usefulness by a cheering, homely presence in the midst of exile. He reckons the population of Mardin to be about 22,000, of whom one-half are Christians, and two-thirds of these again Roman Catholics: we may roughly suppose 7,000 Romish to 3,500 non -Romish followers of the Chaldsean and Syrian churches. The sectarian designations of Nestorian and Jacobite, applied to distinguish dissenting branches, and insisted on by the Roman Catholics, are said to be giving way before a re-assumption of the original popular names. K. and I dine with Mr. W. and family, going up afterwards to the fort and citadel. I should revise my description of yesterday by saying that the Mardin hill is pyramidical in shape, with a flattened top, surmounted by natural rock artificially fitted into a fort, dating, it may be, from the time of the early khalifs, but I think before. The eastern, south-eastern, and southern sides are those of the town, whose houses rise to nearly the whole height of the rock, or some 400 feet. A hill passed on our route to this one, and which isVIl.J THE WOMAN'S FORT crowned by as remarkable a summit, is called Kaf Sanuni. Another, quite close, and more like that of Mardin, is called Kalat-ul-Marra, or ' Woman's Fort.' Both have legends, but I can only recall the second, which is as follows. It was defended by a woman against Tamerlane for a long period, and until the garrison were on the point of starvation. Suddenly, a favourite hitch had a litter, and the idea was conceived of sending the milk in a basin as a present to the fierce besieger. Tamerlane, on seeing this, thinking the garrison well supplied with pro visions, abandoned the siege as hopeless ! Mr. W, thinks there are no Eoman remains, certainly no Roman walls, in Mardin, though it is asserted by some that the walls of Meride, its ancient name, are in good preservation. The Yuzbashi, or captain, of the fort guard, received us with much civility, and gave us the customary coffee at the gate. After enjoying a magnificent view, and looking at the surrounding lions, we returned to our quarters at the telegraph office, taking leave of our excellent host and guide, and his intelligent son.' pkusjan m-.uvant : tacuizi. F FCHAPTER VIII. BAGHDAD TO CONSTANTINOPLE. THE ROUTE CONTINUED THROUGH DIARBEKIR, S1VAS, ANGORA, AND BY STEAMER FROM ISM ID. As an embellisliment to the story of Tamerlane and the ' Woman's Fort,' I was further informed that a fig-tree which the conqueror planted on commencing the siege had actually come to perfection before the said siege was raised. Here is another strange local tradition. A Pasha of Jazirah, in the good old time, or before chronoloo-ies were tested, sent for a celebrated architect O 7 to build him a bridge such as the world had never seen before. The mandate was obeyed : a magnificent unique structure was completed, and the promised sum duly paid. Everyone was struck with admiration at the performance; but one doubt was alive in and troubled the Pasha's breast, vitiating his satisfaction with alloy. He feared that the architect might build a second and a similar bridge for some other employer. He wished to be possessor of the choicest specimen of work by a genius who, in this final instance, had eclipsed himself. Accordingly he made up his mind to destroy him. But his plans were frustrated ; and the intended victim forestalled his intention in a way little anticipated.ch. viii.] vat fail and. Coming to the Pasha, he informed him that the bridge, as now constructed, would not stand the assault of time, but that if he gave him a certain number of skins filled with vinegar and certain specified liquids, he would so secure the cement, that the work would never decay or fall to pieces. The Pasha complied ; the ex periment was made ; the cement, instead of becoming stronger, melted : the bridge disappeared, and with it the architect, who escaped to lands far away. 'June 19.—March to Shaikhana, 5 short hours, or 15 miles. For the first half, over difficult, hilly, and stony ground, to a kind of outpost in the hills at Amr Agha Powar, and over a tolerable road for the remainder of the way. Shaikhana is a dreary spot in respect of house and village, but pleasant in its trees. An old woman, children, a chaosh, and a zahchi (soldier or police- man), give us a surfeit of their society, and no secret is made of the wish to draw the stranger's money. Amuse myself with losing piastres to children by making them guess the hand which contains them ; but own to disappointment at being asked for a present in return for mulberries and milk. It is so much more pleasant, in the case of a supposed gift, to make a voluntary than a forced return. Sleep in the open air without search for better accommodation. 'June 20.—Ak Punghar, the ' White Fountain,' passing Abu Giaour and Khanik Ashada, 9 hours, or 27 miles: a long march. Nature of the country, low hills covered with pasturage; track &gt;tony, but not difficult. Cross the Gok Su, a narrow bed of tor rent. Our stage is rather a wretched place, out in the open, with no trees. Met the Turco-Hungarian Commandant of artil lery from Baghdad, on his way to Constantinople. He dined with us, and my companion K. being a Hanoverian, the two enjoyed a German conversation with a kind of national gusto. 'June 21.—Diarbekir, 6 hours, or 18 miles. Country covered with grass and undulating; very fine, rich, brown soil, but stony. On our way into the town passed an old bridge F F 2TEL FAIR A I'll AM) TRAVEL.

Under the arches of this bridge is a lower road in which the artillery Pasha's ladies placed themselves while we proceeded along the bank above.

Met and accosted two individuals on horseback with a strong resemblance to Frenchmen, and found that one was the Trench Consul. lie informed me, moreover, that he was quite ready to transact any little business w-e might require in the absence of his British colleague, as indeed he had promised the latter to do. Kode with them through part of the town and took leave. Put up at the telegraph office, situated at the further end of Diarbekir from that at which we entered, and received with great cordiality and attention by the Mudir S. Efendi. In the afternoon, called on the Pasha, a hearty, military-looking man, who talked pleasantly and was most polite. His band played like that of the Pasha of Mosul on a similar occasion, but the music was queer and national. M. Pasha is a Mushir, or full general officer, and has come from command of the army in Roumelia to take up joint civil and military rule in Kurdistan, of which Diarbekir is the head-quarters. Bazar good. Astounded at the large blocks of ice exhibited for sale at a mere trifle. 'June 22.—Halt. Have to receive many visits. Among others, a native of India was brought in and introduced by the Telegraph Bey as Haji Baba, an astrologer. I do not like his looks. He may be a refugee, a mutineer—I know not what. His face is that of a Lascar, or little better, but he has a strange smattering of knowledge. With a dash of the Fakir, there is something also in him of the ordinary Munshi, or teacher of Hindustani. The man has long, oiled, curved hair, combed down behind the ears; a dark and unmistakeably Indian complexion; a manner such as 1 have often seen among Indians desirous to dazzle by display of general knowledge. He took occasion to show off his handwriting, and to talk to me of officers whose names are well known in Western India. I asked myself. Who is this man, who appeared at Diarbekir from Mosul some three months ago; whence his fine clothes; and how long and on whatVIII.] A DINNER AT DlAllBEKIli. errand is it that he has left his country ?' His own story is that he lived in the Bendi Bazar at Bombay; that he* quitted India about filteen or sixteen years ago, before the annexation of the Punjab; that he is always travelling; and that he has visited Bukhara, Astrakhan, and many out-of-the-way places. He talks ot Colonel Stoddart, but cannot know much, save by hearsay, ot his personal history. His age may be thirty-five • but it is haul to say exactly. He practises as an astrologer, but takes no money, appearing to be independent both in respect of money and eftects. He had seen and conversed with Mr. T. before his departure from Diarbekir. His Arabic is poor, but good for an Indian-, his Persian is Indian and fluent: Hindustani is, of course, his native tongue. Visit also from the Pasha's Italian doctor, R, to whom I was glad to be able to offer a glass of English bottled beer, for he so thoroughly appreciated it. K. and I, under strong pressure, went to dine with this medico in the evening. The invitation was meant kindly, but gladly would I have escaped it. In the first place, we the guests found our selves seated on the ground before a small table of olives and cherries, cheese and cucumbers, and such like. With these and conversation, cigarettes, and potations of peppermint and water, time passed till dark, and I was contemplating a means of escape. However, that which had transpired was a mere overture or pre lude; and dinner, substantial dinner, followed in earnest. I can not describe it, but it seemed interminable. The cuisine was the Pasha's, and the Pasha's secretary was with us to taste it. I believe the Pasha himself to have been the instigator of the whole scheme. We all ate out ot the same dish, but were favoured with separate spoons. Dinner over, there was more to be done. I was to witness an entertainment such as the beau monde of Diarbekir was pleased to patronize. Proh pudor, it was not edifying or entertaining. They called in a blind piper, a half-starved, half-clothed boy with a tambourine, and a creature dressed as a woman, who danced to the music in the style of an Indian nautch. The dancer was clad in a short jacket, 'with Albanian petticoat; and whirled round and round to a slow tune, gesturing and contorting the limbs and body inyHvfU ' l iM 1 ? 4 1 f 1 T Ij.itty mi, „. 1 c * s I 'r . . n |'fiff| f gii f F !» 438 TELEGRAPH AND TRA VEL. [chap. the coarsest and most barbarous manner. Glad were we to get back to our lodging and prepare for a start in the morning. ' J wm 23.—I am told there are 20,000 1 inhabitants in the town of Diarbekir, ot whom half are Christian, and these chiefly Armenian. There are about 600 Protestants who attend the American Mission chupel in the German Consulate. The city is well situated on the lelt bank of the iigris, and, independently ol its local advantages and handsome structures, is admirably adapted by geographical position to become a leading commercial capital ol Asiatic Turkey. If the loss of its prosperity be attributable to faulty government and general insecurity, there is no reason why ancient glories should not revive with correction of such abuses; and progress in this respect certainly does mark the eftorts made by modern Ottoman administrators. March to Dimika, encamping near Kurdish huts outside of village: 7 hours, or 20 miles. Uiarbekir being a town of considerable size, with gates and walls, it takes time to get clear of it; and li\e o clock is an early hour to stir up the inhabitants with the tianip ot travellers, lioad stony till we reach the open country, when we exchange the pavement for a fair track over green fields. W ork begun on a high road projected hence to Samsun on the black Sea a good and civilized idea. Each Pasha is responsible lor the share ot his own Pashalic. The tents pitched near the scene ot operations looked like business, but the labourers were tew and seemed to want a system. Green fields and cultivation for four hours, up to a narrow stream called the ' Devagechi.' Passing Gaih Tepeh, a small hill with ruined village, and leaving Bektash to the left, we reach our day's 'stage. Servant laid U P with fever. ' Jane 2-i.—Arganeh, 4 hours, or about 15 miles. Eoad good, 1 Mr. Southgate, in his instructive volumes of travels, does not give so large a number. His data show 2,700 families, of whom rather more than half are Muhammadan. Among the Christians, Armenians have the prepon- deiance; but he makes no specification of Protestants. He includes some oU Jewish families also at fJiarbekir. This was, however, thirty-six years ago, since which period many changes may have occurred. Mr. Consul Taylor, in 1865, gives a total of 33,981 houses to the 'sanjak' or district of Diar bekir, of which 23,497 are Muslim and 8,740 Christian.viii.] « VISIT TO THE MONASTERY. 4.39 lor the most part over pasture and cultivation. Cross one ridge ol the mountains which threaten obstruction, but a low and unimportant one. It leads to a second valley nearly sur rounded by hill and mountain, Arganeh forming a conspicuous object in front. Kurds here friendly and hospitable, yet not so interesting as those met with near Mosul. In the after noon K. and 1 sally forth to reach the monastery up the hill. The ascent is steep, but the toil is repaid. As we rise we get a grand view of the town immediately below us, and its 700 houses, looking like part of the rock on which they are built. Above us towers the Mariam Ana in romantic beauty. K. somewhat exhausted, so I enter the building alone. Ushered in to the ' Papas,' but fearing intrusion upon him, plan an early departure. All, however, goes smoothly, and after visiting the chapel and one or two other places, 1 am again invited into the presence of the Superior, and this time escorted into his private room. What will T take, coffee or raki ? and a case is opened containing certain choice bottles of certain choice liqueurs. I decline the spirit, on the jilea of abjuring such practices when the sun is high : whereupon the Papas, with an expression of approval, orders a ' finjan' of most excellent coffee, so good that another soon follows, my host remarking on the smallness of the vessel. It should be noted that, before the coffee, a mysterious box is brought to me, in which a spoon, placed in proximity to a kind of preserve, clearly indicates that I am to taste a mixture not unlike a compound of dates. Having taken leave of the Papas, the next in rank carries me off to his apartment, and will not let me go till he also has feasted me. The fare provided is a roll, not unlike our own in daily use, but soft to the touch, and quite black inside; and butter or cream, and cheese, with, perhaps, one or more accessories. This Armenian monastery of Mariam Ana occupies a frontage of about .100 yards, looking south-west, one end turning to the south, T counted ten windows in the upper row of the long central building, and nine in the lower. The difference might have been ima ginary, and caused by the position taken up for inspection.440 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. It is situated at the summit of the Arganeh hill, which may be 700 feet above the level of the village below. The chapel attached to it is said to be very old, founded by St. Thaddeus the Apostle in a.d . 47. Old Armenian copy of the New Testa ment here preserved is a valuable relic. Below the monastery, at a point ot the rock, is a curious ruin, an arch and a gate, which is a Musalman place of pilgrimage, called Zul Kifli. Another Musalman ziarat is at the Ali Daghi, on a hill close by. There is a Mudir in Arganeh. One half the town is said to be Christian, chiefly, I believe, Armenian Catholic. We put up in a garden not far from the khan, and well away from the town. June 25. Popalusak, Gi hours, or 19 miles, through the mountainous region of the Batman. Many ascents and descents over hills clothed with verdure, with occasional stony and difficult bits. Ihey have established here six posts at intervals of one short hour each, two chaoshes in every hut, to keep up a special service of foot inspectors of the line of telegraph. For the hard work of winter, especially, the relief must be acceptable. June 26. Kizin, an easy march of hours, or 14 miles, full ol interest. In one hour sight Guljak, the 'Little Lake,' a charming sheet of water among the hills. Its length is, li'om east and by north to west and by south, about twelve miles in the longest part : its breadth is at most four miles. On its southern side and at the widest part is Xartun, a vil lage containing about twenty Kurd houses ; and on the same side Guljak, a liaya village, with a boat and about fifty houses. Here was once a monastery, which was cutoff by the waters and isolated. Ihere is said to be a cluster of some ten houses on the north, and a village about six miles to the west: Kizin, our halting-place, is about 14 miles to the east. Except a small open space on the Kizin side, the lake is nearly shut in by hills coming down to its waters. These hills, which become green in appearance on near approach, look sufficiently barren in the distance to make the blue waters, of Guljak a charming contrast. On the Kizin side I observed two fishermen sleepilyVIII.] THE LITTLE LAKE. 441 waiting to catch their prey. A miniature channel, some two or three yards long, is scooped out on the sandy beach, at the end of which is placed an open basket resting on its side, and in viting fish to enter: about half of it may be in the water. When the fish enter, the neck of the channel is closed with a stone or two, and they are prevented from returning backward. Indeed, a big fish which might easily enough be drawn into the channel, would have difficulty in turning and getting out under almost any circumstances, and even if the channel were not blocked up at the neck at all. 'Before coming up to the Little Lake, we breakfasted at the romantically situated village of Malatu, which strikes pleasantly the eye of the traveller on first nearing the foot of the mountain he has traversed on journeying from the Diarbekir side. It overhangs a dell with a pretty clump of trees and rivulet in the foreground,—a combination often seen in these localities. On completing our descent we sight, and encamp under a second portion, as it were, of the village ; not quite so wild in appear ance as the first, but of the same brownish-red hue, and equally like the soil from which it rises. Some of its walls are of one solid coating: others present the usual division into sun-dried bricks. Halt, under ' erik,' or plum-trees, on a gentle slope just above the valley, and enjoy a quiet rest to the music of the never-tiring rill beneath us. Met party with caravan, conveying lead to Diarbekir ; probably from Tokat, whither copper is taken for moulding from the Arganeh mines. Pass the night amid the trees. 'June 27.—Kharput; 7 hours, or 21 miles, on a mode rate computation. During the first four hours, cross the ' Deva Boiun' mountain, nearly 5,000 feet above the Black Sea level. Sight on the march a snowy range to the far north, and a grand plain between, on the further side of which other high points intervene. The view r is magnificent, and an idea of the extent of low country may be formed from the fact that the Murad Chai, one of the largest rivers of Asia Minor, a section indeed of the Euphrates itself, appears like a petty canal in the nudst of the plain through which it runs. Breakfast at an442 telegraph and travel. [chap. Armenian village in the plain, with gardens, and apparently flourishing. Its home-made wine was very respectable. The village of Tesli, through which we ride a few minutes before reaching Mazra (the cantonment of Kharput on the hill), is a large place, with a soupgon of European arrangement; but it is dirty. Mazra-hasa British-Indian look about it in the distance, and has a Pasha's house, kishlak or barracks, and a telegraph office. We put up in the latter. 'June 2%. —Halt. Quite a luxury to find oneself in a large room, even without tables or chairs ; but the climate here is not so fine and fresh as I had been led to expect. Went up the hill to call on the American Missionaries. Accosted by one of them whom we passed in the road : he pressed us to come to tea and spend the evening : accepted for to-morrow. On calling to-day, saw no less than five ladies, two unmarried. Visited the Kharput chapel and Bedestan. In the way of articles for purchase there is not much beyond the common oriental bazar display. Some children's faces here, as at Diarbekir and at Mosul, are to me most winning : brown, ruddy, with long, thickly-grown fair hair, like peasant children of two and a half centuries ago in England, or some limmerings of Murillo and Eeynolds. There is a Con- sulat de France at Kharput. 'June 29.—Further halt. Some derive Kharput, or Harput, from the Armenian words for stone and castle: but Mr. Consul Taylor refers to a definition by a literary Defterdar, from the Persian khar, a donkey, and hat an idol. The same autho rity adds that this allusion to Pagan worship has caused the Porte to change the name altogether to ' Mamuriat-ul -Azizah.' The height of the town is estimated by Mr. Brant and Lieu tenant Glasscott, R.N. at 4,832 feet, and Mazra to be 3,618 feet above the level of the Black Sea. ' Our fat, good-natured friend, the Mudir of the telegraph station, dined with us last night; an Indian bullock -trunk serving for a table. He had sherry, beer, and sparkling hock, and seemed to relish the mixture. Guns firing to-day, and great sensation caused by the arrival of the Persian Ambassador on his way to Constantinople.viii.] .1 ME RIGA N Ml SSI ON A R1ES. 443 ' \\ r eut again to the American Missionaries. Messrs. B., W., and A., with their wives and children, and Messrs. W. and E., occupy t\\ o \6iy good lionses in the highest and most airy quarter of Kharput. Their church is a roomy, square building, with an upper storey containing the class-rooms of a colle giate institution, besides six bedrooms to accommodate eighteen boarders. One room, called Mr. Eobinson's, was built at the sole cost of a gentleman ol that name, who remitted the money from England. He seems to have rendered great assistance to the Mission generally, who otherwise acknowledge considerable English and local (or Constantinople) support. Their envoy at the Porte is not, they say, quite in the same position to influence the Sultan on their behalf as the British Ambassador; and it is, therefore, to the representative of her Majesty that they look for much. Lord S. was a firm friend to them. Of Sir H. B. they say little; more of Mr. E., to whom they are attached from acts evincing personal interest. The American Mission has been here for seven years. I hear that one of the Pashas is so attached to Mr. B., a Turkish scholar and superior man in every way, that he takes him gently by the beard and kisses his forehead! Their account of the modern Turks is very cheering. How different from the bigoted Muslim in other places! Can this be in any sense a fruit of our Anrdo- Turkish policy ? 'June 30.—Kharput still. Dine with Mr. and Mrs. B. ^isit the girls' school and collegiate institution. Young Ar menian women are interesting, and have very handsome 0 dark eyes, but want elegance of contour. The head is the most attractive part of the picture, one tied with a jaunty kerchief, one encased in an ornamented fez: but this comely head is put upon an awkward body, either very square or broad- shouldered, or with very slouching gait. Some faces remind me of Italian peasantry, some of English village life: all have a ower-class aspect. Miss W. examines in Armenian: the su ject is ' Conscience.' The behaviour of the girls is superior; J e order and attention remarkable. Among them are a few lied m omen, wives of the elder students. The singing ofm ii. : fHiPm - t| the Armenian version of ' There is a happy land' was reallv good, and struck sensibly home. The Armenian collegiate youths are a heavy, unyouthful-looking set, with few excep tions. Can say little of their capabilities ; for the questions put in geography and arithmetic were of a more than connnonlv primitive nature. ' July 1.—Difficulty about mules ; but manage to leave Kharput. March in the afternoon to Khankui, 31 hours, or 10 miles. Plain and cultivated country in a broad valley between hills. The women in these parts wear a long gown with opening below the hip on either side, an under short petticoat reaching to the knee, and trousers; head tied up, and sometimes the mouth covered with a kerchief. There is a kind of pinafore also worn up to the neck; slippers are on the feet, the hair is plaited, and a cloth is folded round the waist. Khankui is Turkish. We are snugly enough put up at the top of a house, and get our quiet dinner at nightfall. Have again to take to task the soldier sent with me, for extortion on the villagers under cloak of my service. The Bash Chaosh, or inspector of telegraph, who accompanies me, is soldierly-looking and handsome, but empty-pated and conceited; and has more regard for his person and pocket than his duty. An old man named Ferhada, who came with us from Diarbekir, is a model Bash Chaosh, and has spoiled me for all others. 'July 2.—Iz Oghlu, 7iV hours; or.23 miles. After more than five hours passing through village, valley and ravine, we descend into the valley of the Upper Euphrates, close by the caravanserai of the Sultan Murad. This resting-house is very solidly built, and the arches, in what appears to have been a stable, are worthy of special note. The mosque has a yellowish stone frontage, which may have been later con structed than the dark stone of the inner building, but I doubt it. The rooms want air and ventilation ; and though they may be cool caverns in the intense heat, in winter they should be suffocating, with fires such as Asiatics love to kindle. lh e Euphrates is here, at times, very narrow ; but variable inviii.] IIAHY AND BAKHSHISH. 445 breadth, and tortuous. Banks in some places shelving, in others abrupt and crumbling. Observed an arrow-headed in scription on a stone within the frame of a rpck. The stone is about five feet long by five feet broad, and faces S.S.E. to the river. There are about forty divisions of lines. Iz Oghlu is a remarkably ugly village ; and its name presents a suggestive and appropriate combination for English ears. 'July 3.—I might have almost said that Iz Oghlu was the ugliest village I had ever seen, but that there w T as one imme diately opposite on the right bank of the Euphrates which was uglier still. ' What is the name of that ?' said I. ' Iz Oghlu,' was the reply. Yes, and there appear to be one or two more villages which enjoy the same denomination. ' I cannot, however, leave this place without reverting to those who extended to the stranger travellers there the right hand of fellowship. We were put into a house at Iz Oghlu, occupied by a Kurdish family. The owner was a young married man, seemingly well enough to do in the world, with flocks and herds and so forth, and a pretty, interesting young wife. His look was simple and honest, with a slight alloy, perhaps, of self-esteem ; lie had a countenance which, if fairer, might have been Ger man, rendered so more especially by a reddish-brown moustache. The only, and I presume first child of this young couple, was an immense pet. It was at one time carried about by an elderly lady, whom I take to be papa's mamma, but who, T am sure, was baby's grandmamma ; at another time, placed in a little cradle outside the door of the inner room. The little thing was not a bad kind of baby of a few months old, would open its bright little eyes if spoken to, and laugh ; would cry as all babies do, when something happened to make it sufficiently sad for tears. In an auspicious moment, I went up to grandmamma with this loved plaything in her arms—the doll of her second childhood—and gave her the last of the rosy silk kerchiefs to which I have before alluded, and a supply of which I should recommend to all travellers in these parts. Dear old soul, how pleased and proud she was at this. Very soon was it taken in and shown to mamma; very soon was it taken in and shown440 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [ CHVP to papa; very soon had the neighbours and kinsfolk admired the fortunate gift. The next move was to make a turban of it tor babys head; the next to bring baby so attired outside for exhibition, I afterwards saw the child sleeping with the hand kerchief round its little head ; indeed, I do not think I saw that ( hild again in an}* shape, without that handkerchief. How pleasant and grateful, that a gift, however small, should be appreciated ! How different from the pour-boire extracted from one by some commissionnaire, gar^on, or valet de place in ad dition to liberal payment for service ! I hope my young Kurd had none of that feeling when he looked, as I thought, coldly on me at parting. Perhaps I should not have told my servant to give him his ' bakhshish.' 'March to Burana, 5£ hours, or 17 miles, crossing the noble river of old in about two hours, at the Hardargemi Su Ferry. The country struck me as comparatively barren about this part, and wearing a sad and dreary look in spite of bold scenery. ()bserve a Rhine-like mountain, with something of a tower or castle on the summit. 'July 4.—Hasan Badrik, a Kizilbash village, 5| hours, or 16 miles: reckoned 24 hours, or 72 miles from Kharput. To judge from the opinions of my Turkish attendant, the Bash Ohaosh, these Kizilbash are considered a bad lot, and an orthodox Muslim will not eat with them. They also call them Alawis. Lut I do not trust my Bash Chaosh, or his opinions. His manner in the road, his perpetual umbrella, his atrocious politeness, all annoy me. A\ hy was not this fine animal made an Imperial tiooper, to forage and swagger at his pleasure, instead of a telegraph official ? and yet the work upsets his weak nerves, as it is, and tires him, and he wants to become an indoor mani pulator instead of an outdoor inspector! Crossed the Sultan Su, a section of the Tokma Su, over which is a bridge of twenty-two arches, an old khan, and a burial-ground with inscriptions of recent date. One stone looks curious, is about 4 feet by 1|, and has foiu lines of quaint Arabic or Turkish letters, barely iegible, part of which seems to be : ' Atamiz daolat Sultan-ul- Ghalib, oi Our master, the victorious monarch.' A fight among O ^VI'.] an enjoyable halt. 447 Kurds is sjiid to have taken place here not many years ago • hence the graves. We are approaching the hills, and about 0 to rise into mountainous tracts. This kaza, or ' district' of Argavan, consists of many paras, or villages, of which Hasan Badrik is about the chief. Akcha Dagh is a neighbouring district, peopled by many Kurds and Kizilbash. 1 July March to Hakim Khan: 6 hours, or 18 miles. After three-quarters of an hour the telegraph line leaves the road to plunge into gullies and over acclivities, and through most difficult country (more so than, I think, any we have hitheito traversed, not excepting the Batman Dagh, Deva Boiun, or country between Jazirah and Mardin); meets the road again in about an hour, and then skirts it, more or less, up to the point where it descends into the Kuru Chai, and keeps a good course near its bank. Halt and refresh on reach ing this river. Find the ruins of an old bridge, in the shape of one whole arch and some remains of pillars. Below these is running a narrow, but rapid, stream towards the Euphrates. The water is delicious. Our horses are tied by one leg and turned out to graze on a fresh green bit of pasture. Near the bridge are the ruins of an old khan. Our own siesta was among rose-bushes, thorn and tamarisk trees, circled with beautiful wild flowers of mostly delicate hue—yellow, pale rose, pale blue, and white—at a stone's throw from the water still flowing in the bed of the mis-called kuru, or ' dry' river, a humble source of the great Euphrates. Descent to Hakim Khan, stony ; the soil of a white colour, as between Eeshmil and Mardin. Passed on our left, high, rocky table-land, said to be inhabited } Kurds of the Akcha Dagh. Hakim Khan, a singular and unattractive place, situated in a basin between high hills, and looking hot and feverish. Doctored a sick chaosh here, who siould, however, be allowed a change of air in preference to ot er medicine. K. complains, and looks worn and weary. 'July 6.—Hasan Chelibi, 4 hours, or 12 miles. Almost Mr. Consul Taylor, in his capital paper No. XI. in the 38th vol. of the nwal Geographica 1 Society's Journal (1868), gives interesting information on i ne ivizilbash, and shows where more is obtainable.448 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [ CUA1&gt; wholly near the bed of the Kuru Chai, along a path tolerably free from obstruction. Passed a Kabuli on the way, with whom I exchange a few words in Persian. Our stage of the day is a village of about 100 houses of Kizilbash. Put up in a cool mud house full of flies, and am visited by the Mudir. Landlord tells me that when Sultan Murad was here, he was entertained by a certain Hasan in so gentlemanly a style, that the monarch named the village after him, with the affix of Chelibi, 'gentleman.' Viewed from the high ground above, this village, buried deep in the basin formed by sur rounding hills, has a sombre and strange appearance. The flat roofs, from which mis-shapen chimney-pots arise, give the notion that there are no houses there at all, but that the land is sown, as it were, with chimneys. There are two rows, how ever, of these flat roofs, one rising upon the other; and a big gutter below, once a mountain streamlet, but perverted from its former origin. At night, transferred my cot and bedding to the house-top and vainly tried to sleep. Some watchmen, in tended, as it proved, for my special protection, kept talking insufferably. 'July 7.—In the morning, when T was preparing for a start, a nest of extortioners opened out. Everyone wanted bakhshish. ' 1 was your nauhatji (sentry),' said one. ' I also,' said another, ' watching over the horses.' Shukuri was called to explain, but could not. The applicants then said that there might be ' Kurds ' about. ' Kurds !' said I, ' more likely they are afraid of you. Siz dan korhior. I have lived in Kurds' tents, and never been troubled by fear of robbery'—or words to this effect. Then came a fellow, professedly with civil messages from the Mudir, his fine expressions culminating in a request for bakhshish. There was something rude and ungainly in this dirty village of Hasan Chelibi that made one rejoice to leave it; and when I found an exit from the pinched corner into comparative space, I seemed to breathe a freer atmo sphere. Country more open and green. The hills continue, but are more cheery. Allaja Khan, 7 hours, or 20 miles. Put up in a small khan like that of yesterday. Koom about 22 by 15.VIII.] national costume. 449 A space is poled off for travellers. There is one low door for an entrance, and a fireplace opposite. The windows are barely a foot square, and limited to two. To-day the walls are white washed, so that the place does not feel quite dungeon-like. There is, however, a larger khan here, now used as a storeroom, built of very fine stone. Chaosh pointed out a cross on one of the stones of this building, which indicated Christian handi craft. A smash of liquor-case reported to-day. Memo. : bought six bottles of brandy for the journey at Baghdad, have not tasted one drop, yet not one of these bottles is now left. 'I have seen many ill-looking telegraph chaoshes on this journey, but Ali Chaosh, whose beat is from Hasan Chelibi to the three-hour khan, beats all: in ugliness and ungainliness he is ' first-class.' And I am sorry to add that nothing has occurred to lead me to believe his morale superior to his physique. A very long face, with a very long, loose nose, frowning eye and uncom fortable mouth, a forehead whose principal feature is a batch of cropped hair smoothed down its centre, and a sharp chin; such is a portrait which reminds me of James's Gallon the Fool, in ' Philip Augustus.' I doubt whether the Turkish official is any thing of that stamp, and should be sorry to trust his honour in any way. As to his dress: such slovenliness, such huge holes at elbow and knee, such dirt, such disorder, are barely describable. While on this theme, I may here record that if I never remember to have seen a well-dressed Turkish soldier in the olden time, the same remark applies at the present hour to a Turkish telegraph chaosh. Even later improvements in military costume are more laudable in masses than individuals. But what can be expected of a taste which tolerates men and women in red and yellow boots far too large for the feet and legs which they cover ? The chaosh who met us at the khan was an Armenian, and spoke English a little, and Italian a little better. We talked immensely, lie and his brother, the chaosh on the next beat, had been employed (as firemen, I think) on hoard an English steamer in the Black Sea. March to Kangal, 5 hours or 15 miles. The dreary nature of the country traversed since, and just before crossing the Upper G G450 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. Euphrates—at first exhibited in sparse and dry cultivation and desolate look of villages, and latterly in the absence of villages altogether, halting-stations excepted—was never more strongly impressed upon my mind than on this day's journey. At the same time, the openness, as it were, of desolation and depopu lation, is less painful to the eye and sense than the dreary basin in the immediately surrounding hills, hiding a dismal village such as Hakim Khan or Hasan Chelibi. Put up at a khan. Kurdish tents near the town. ' July 9,—Delikli Tash, the ' stone with the hole ;' 4 hours, or 12 miles. A small Turkish village of about sixty houses. Country undulating: hills not actually barren, but of pale hue and wanting in bright vegetation. Armenian chaosh relieved by a corpulent Turk whom we meet on the way, and who escorts us to the day's stage. His interest with the Mudir pro cures us an excellent room; but we are doomed to a series of visits, and the Mudir will feed us, which are inconvenient con tingencies. Compromise the matter by accepting breakfast only, pleading the state of my companion's health as an excuse for the heavier meal. ' July 10.—Ulach ; a short 4- hours, or about 10 miles. Ar menian village of some sixty houses, dirty and offering little worthy of note. Road through a pass in the hills, and over high hilly tract, to plain country. The fat chaosh is a great character. His name is Aflatun, ' Plato.' He talks of Europe with immense yusto, of beer, champagne, and ladies. His description of a German hotel he had once visited was capital: and equally amusing are his quotations from Hafiz, and the sighs with which each is accompanied. His politics are ambitious, and embrace a variety of individuals and subjects, such, for instance as Garibaldi, the French Emperor, Spain, Portugal, the war between Denmark and Germany, the war in America: but there is more ambition than profundity in his speculations. The secret of the ' Delikli Tash ' was solved this morning. We descended a really fine pass of this name, sighting a grand panorama of the lower country and distant hills. On our left was a circular rock, with a hole sufficiently large toVIII.] ARRIVAL AT SIVAS. 451 admit the passage ot a tall, stout man, when stooping ; or a moderately fat man, without stooping or squeezing at all. To pass seven times through this is, my stout friend informs me, to attain the desire of one's heart, whatever that may be. I think he claimed to have gone through the ordeal. If so, the effort must have been considerable. Met a poor Circassian, who asked foi biead. Thousands oi these families have arrived of late years, from Anapa and other places, at Samsun and Trebi- zond; and have been flooding the Sivas district. A village about 12 hours distant is said to contain a colony. Met three the day before yesterday, armed, and dressed in their picturesque native costume. For breakfast to-day, have bread like a black smith's or cobbler's leather apron, eggs boiled hard and cut up into slices, excellent cow's milk, and hard but good cheese. 'July 11.—Sivas : 6^ hours, or 20 miles. Good road among the mountains, with descent into a high, broad plain, watered by the Kizil Irmak, or ' red river.' Met camels bringing hemp from lokat, which Plato tells me is manufactured into ropes there prior to export, and grows abundantly in the neighbour hood. Less than half way, Tnzlu Punar, the ' salt spring/ where the Ottoman Government has posted two of its servants to make the most of the produce. Realization stated at 40,000 piastres, or 400/. per annum ; but Sivas has much more salt than in this one spot. The aspect of the city from the distant heights is pleasing. Dotted here and there with trees, at times in large extended clusters, the houses and citadel cover a vast space, and appear much scattered. Met by the telegraph superintendent, M. Efendi, at several miles out of the town : a youngish but self-contident man of pleasing address, not unlike an Indian irregular horseman. White coat, waistcoat, and trousers, high polished boots—such was his attire; and he rode a smart white horse with a smart embroidered saddlecloth, military saddle, and holsters. His face is plain, pitted with small-pox, by which one eye has been sensibly affected ; nor has I'e the advantage of hair on the cheek, upper lip, or chin, to conceal defects: but his manners promise well for an Asiatic, 'ind I am favourably prepossessed in his behalf. After crossing G G 2V ii f . KM-! i I.7* 1 .

This was an honour for which I was not prepared. Put up at the Serai, where also is the tele graph office; and visited by Dr. W. and two of his Armenian pupils. Letters had preceded me to this gentleman from his fellow-countrymen, the American Missionaries of Kharput; and I had moreover sent a few lines to him myself, on the subject of K.'s health, before entering Sivas. 'July 12.—Make up my mind to halt until the 16th, for two or three strong reasons. K. requires rest, an 1 so do the horses. Call on Dr. W., whom I take to be a physician-missionary here.

He put me much in mind of the generally received portraits of one of our best known modern Indian heroes. The Efendi gave me about four hours of his society to-day, thereby showing a deplorable ignorance or recklessness of the value of time. lie does rot sport his chibouk, but cigarettes and nugce may become equally impediments to progress. I have asked him to dine with us to-morrow. Plato would, I feel sure, like to join ; but our habits will not admit of it, although they tell me he was once a collector of customs on the Bosnian frontier, and that a certain Mudir of a district near Baghdad was his clerk! Dr. W. estimates the population of Sivas at 10,000 houses, or from 40,000 to 50,000 souls, of which more than a fifth are Ar menian. Bought good woollen stockings made here, and tasted splendid tobacco of the country. Bread good, meat also. Wine of a pale straw colour, like bad, sharp beer or flat cider; very different from the cheery red wine of Kharput. Cherry ice to day—a great luxury. The vieiv from our windows over the tops of houses and towards the hills, immediately above a little bit of quasi-garden, is certainly less Asiatic than we had been led to expect. But the English sky and climate have, perhaps, more to do with the feeling of nearness to one's fatherland than more tangible things. Thermometer in the heat of the day only '8viii.] CIRCASSIAN EXODUS OF 1864. There is a Liva Pasha, or Major-General, liere, coiiimanding the troops. Jidy 13.—I feel quite sure that the electric telegraph in Turkey is abused by those who have the power of abusing it, inasmuch as a vast number of telegrams on the public service are intercommunicated without the faintest occasion, and for the mere sake of gratifying the vanity or whims of members of the Administration. This entails much extra labour which could be avoided, and converts a valuable State engine into a plaything. ' I learn that the district of Azizya has been made over to the immigrant Circassians, under the superintendence of a specially- appointed Kaimakam. Its markiz, or ' head-quarters,' at Panar Bash, may be distant some 24 hours from this place in a southerly or south-westerly direction. Tlie Emperor of liussia replies to the charge of forcing on the exodus by a statement that endeavours were made not to exterminate the population, hut simply to keep them at a greater distance, or towards the Kouban. It is said that part of three important tribes, one of which boasts a population of 30,000, are now located on the right bank of that river. The Oubyhs turned a deaf ear to proposals of settlement, and preferred war to the limitations of the Kouban. The Grand Duke Michael has himself been down to the scene of distress, and endeavoured to relieve the sufferers, as well as facilitate the emigration. Our Ambassador at the Porte proposes to colonize with Circassians the space between the Black Sea and Erzerum, a proposal supported by France, by Ali and Fuad Pasha. A letter from Samsun of the 15th June states that 100,000 Circassians were then there, and typhus was raging among them. The numbers at Trebizond I have understood at no less a figure, and they are reported to have died there at the rate of 100 per diem. There is some thing very dreadful in all this. The Turks are a hospitable people, no doubt, and welcome readily, as brother Muhammadans, the sufferers from the encroachment of a foreign enemy : but this accession of a sickly, helpless, and otherwise undesirable population must be detrimental to healthy progress.

The Kaimakam of Azizya is a son of the pre sent Governor of Sivas. It seems highly probable that Sir H. B.'s proposition will be carried out. The London Society has forwarded 1,000/. towards the relief of this wretched but heroic people. 1 ' Dr. W. and friend took us to the ruined buildings called by Plato generally the tombs of the Seljuki. According to the inscriptions, these truly fine monuments appear to date no earlier than 670 of the Hajra, or about a.d . 1271-2; but I think that the actual tombs may be traceable to a prior period. They are here called those of Kai Khosru and Kai Kobad, but the inscription above the door, so far as I could decipher, mentions Kai Khosru only ; and may not this be a mere title ? The main buildings are two quadrangles, one facing the other, in a narrow street. They have remarkably handsome gates, one probably 70 feet high, with two cupolas, or miliars, of 40 feet. Another building of similar kind is at a little distance; but all seem to have been comprised within one set of strong stone walls, probably the ancient Sebaste. The one quadrangle contains a madrasah (college) and the turbat (tomb); the other may have 1 According to the Levant Herald of the 6th July, 1864, which quotes the report, to the Board of Health at the Porte, of Dr. Barozzi, the Circassian immigration had assumed colossal proportions since the preceding March. The numbers were from 50,000 to 70 000 in Trebizond, and 110,000 to 112,000 in Samsun. Crowded into small vessels, without food or fresh water, drinking from the salt sea, many died on board ; and dead and living were thrown together. Landed, they were uncared for and without shelter ; decimated by small-pox and typhus. There was at least one sick person, on the average, in every family ; and in many cases, whole families perished in camp. The sick lay on the bare ground, with no sufficient ministration ; the four or five medical men being inadequate to the work required. Among women and children the mortality was especially great ; the bodies were left to putrefy ; at Trebizond more than 800 died out of 27,000 to 30,000, in April ; but at Samsun the daily loss was estimated at above 500, out of 40,000 or 50,000. In the best situated and perhaps best cared-for encampment, that of Harianli near Samsun, 11 died daily out of 3,000. Added to this, the horrors of bread scarcity had been experienced at Samsun, where the poorer immigrants had to subsist upon roots, grasses, and any chance fragments thoy could find.viii.] BITLTS AND VAN. 455 been the mosque, but this is a doubtful point. Met an Indian to-day, whom [ take to be a suspicious character. What can these fellows be doing here ? He professes to have been a wanderer for fifteen years. ' July 14.—Pasha kindly offers to cash a bill for us, about which there is some difficulty with the Bazar merchants. To use an expression of one of my Sivas friends, I surmise that a certain departmental official here ' stimulates.' 'July 15.—There have been great changes of late in the political distributions in Asia Minor, of which one of the most important is the creation of an Erzingan Pashalic. Erzerum takes in Moosh and Van ; for there is no Pasha at Bitlis, which is still represented as comparatively insecure. Mr. B., a Missionary stationed there, tells me there may be 4,000 or 5,000 houses at Bitlis, of which 1,200 are Armenian. It is near the Lake Van, described as a pleasant enough residence in exchange for a town. The Sipan mountain runs down to the lake, and rises probably to 5,000 feet above it, being thus at least 9,000 feet above the sea level. Dine with Dr. and Mrs. W., Mr. and Mrs. B., a Missionary and lady from Constantinople, and some young children. The Armenian waiting-maid might from her appear ance have been English. Mr. L. and lady were not with us, owing, it may be, to the sickness of their young folks, who seem susceptible to fever here. Plato is in attendance with a lanthorn to escort us home. People are apt to be taken up in the streets at night: but great privileges are allowed to Europeans, under which head Americans are naturally included at Sivas. The European, or it may be rather considered the Christian political shield, is largely protective among the modern Muslims of Asia Minor. 'July 16.—Sivas to Muntashir, 7 hours, or 21 miles, in the afternoon. Kind Dr. W. came to see us before starting; nor would he accept any remuneration for professional services rendered to K., a fact which speaks more for the goodness of his heart than his worldly wisdom.

Thence to Muntashir about five miles. Find village deserted, except by two or three women and children; and our caravan, though despatched at an early hour from Sivas, had only just arrived. Cold enough to make me put on a thick overcoat, and resort to a thick double blanket. 'July 17.—Halt to-day. Weather lovely, air clear and fresh: nothing of India here. This little village, with its pears, plums, poplars, and tamarisk trees, is not very pretty or picturesque, but so far as we can judge from the 17th July, it possesses a splendid climate. Hearing yesterday of its hot and cold springs, I got a guide to take me there. This guide is worthy a leaf in the note book, for he is a type to be pleasantly remembered. Zimma was quite the old Asia Minor Turk; his old, white-bearded, sharp- featured face, with its slight nose straight but peaked, and greyish indistinct eyes, was surmounted by an untasseled fez, round which was tied a green turban. His shoulders were bent by age and infirmity, and were not improved by the dingy blue-striped vest, tied with an old dirty-white cloth round the waist. His black Dutchman-like unmentionables were tattered, and showed other colours ; his legs were bound round with strips of worsted, tied with worsted thread, all stuffed, with the feet, into an old slipper or shoe, but were uncovered at the upper part of the call below the knee. Patches many were visible in his exterior. He was about sixty, he said, but did not seem to know whether more or less; and he carried a stick with which he stumped along cavalierly. The best part of his outer man was his bare bit ol leg, which looked sturdy and of healthy colour. We must have walked nearly four miles to the springs, and the same distance back, to say nothing of my &lt;.wn particular wandeiings at tie place itself. The old boy carried me over a brook, somewhat deep and wide. Two old women were sitting on the opposite side. They had their two donkeys awaiting their pleasure besic e them, and seemed dames well enough to do in the world. spoke across the brook to Zimma; first about himself, then aboviii.] SPRINGS NEAli MUNTASHIR. 457 shu cldam, 'that man;' meaning my humble self. Who was I, and whence had 1 sprung? ' SJm adam' said 1, in Turkish, 'has come from Baghdad, and is going to Constantinople.' After a little bit of talk we went on our way, I thinking that the old lady might have offered the loan of her animal to get me across the water. The springs are well worth the visit, and I may jot down some account of my hurried inspection, of them. 1 had no compass with me, but should put them down to be about fifteen or sixteen miles west of Sivas—some on the very high ground, some nearer the valley of the Yeldiz Su. 1 only visited the first; the latter were, I was told, com paratively hot springs. To begin from the westernmost part, or that nearest to the village of Muntashir, whence I walked over: I ascended a hill for, it may be, 300 or 400 feet, when there arose a kind of basin formed by two ridges of sand stone, semi-circular and semi-oval in shape, and of considerable length, not closed at either extremity. One ridge, that to the left, continued its course eastward, and this course I now follow. At about 500 yards from the point of separation from the opposite ridge we observe a series of springs—or I should call them, volcancitos. At first there is nothing but a deep fissure in the backbone of the ridge, choked up for the most part with wild flowers and grasses: we then come to little pits and large pits, where once were living springs ; then to two or three live springs themselves, more or less large; then a gap; then a further ascent with a tolerably large basin ; a further ascent, with a basin at top, of oval shape, which we pause to describe. It may be 12 feet long, and is on sand-stone ; the water is tepid, and trickles through a narrow cleft into a larger and lower basin of circular shape. This last is walled round with huge blocks of stone, say some 30 feet in circumference ; the water is tepid and emits smoke : counted six springs working in it. Beside it is a small spring, whose water looks clearer than that of the large basin to which it is tributary. Further on is another, also topid, in which I counted seven bubbles at work. We next 'iave a grassy gap of say fifty yards, then a sand-stone ridge, a^ain full of springs. The first contains very nearly mid water:458 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. then comes a remarkable one on a high point, about 18 feet in circumference. Below the ridge are also two basins to be noted: one about 12 feet long, slightly oval, in which 1 counted live spouts and a minor one, water tepid; and one, the largest of all, perhaps 40 feet in circumference, coldish. Ascending the ridge again, which turns a little bit to the northward, we now have along backbone in which may be counted more than forty live springs, varying in size and power, ihose not bubbling are not included, nor is one nearly cold. The ridges average perhaps 15 feet in height, slopes are gentle, backbone is sharp: in one place only, on the western side among the extinct springs, there was a broad trough of some extent. here the springs were active, the water was trickling down in all directions. Those pointed out to me in the distance on crossing the Yeldiz Su showed like a cascade. The springs rise in little globules just above the surface of the basins, it is difficult to count them: one rises almost in the other, in appearance from under the water. The neighbouring ground is hard stone and sand. People bathe here, and the waters are considered healing; but 1 was advised not to stay too long in them. Some of the small springs made a orumbling, gurgling sound, as though eager to display themselves. All go by the general name of ' Chermik;' and 1 hear there are, besides those at the Yeldiz Su (called Kalun Chermik), three others at no great distance, as follows :— ' 1.

' A kalisa ' (church), he replied. ' What,' said I,' are there any Christians here ?' He explained that there were two distinct divisions of the same village; the one half Muslim, the other Christian. We had entered by the former. ' And an; you then,' continued I, inspecting him somewhat narrowly, ' a Christian ?' ' No,' said he, ' I am a Muslim, but T am coming with you.' That is to say, he was coming with me over to the Christian side, to pick up any stray piastres we might have to distribute there. Hospitably received by the Armenian Kahia, who gave us a basin of excellent yoghurt, some aprons of bread (the bread in these parts is just like a leather apron), cheese, and a very greasy omelette. Proceeded on our journey to Kawak, a picturesque-lookish village, built, as it were, into and out of the sides of two high hills, and facing into a ravine between, down which flowed a mountain stream. The first house to which we were taken not pleasing our Sivas chaosh, we were transferred to a second, in an upper storey, clean enough in the woodwork, but whose cushions had fleas. Still, it was comparatively an eligible abode. Thermometer 63° at 2 r .m. Yeni Khan may have 120 houses, of which 60 are Armenian and 60 Turkish : Kawak 100, all Muhammadan. Met many carts and camels to-day, bringing wheat from Yuzgat, and wood from this neighbourhood. On the right of our road was a Circassian village.

Mushallem Kalehsi, 6| hours, or 20 miles ; over high and wooded country, or difficult and intersected by a deep ravine, with gradual descent towards the completion of the stage. The place itself is an ordinary village, with the ' Fort ot Musli- allem,' standing on a steep hill of perhaps 300 feet. It is about as difficult to get antiquarian information out of a 1 urk as out of an Indian peasant. My chaosh told be that Mushallem was a Genoese, and built a fort. The name sounds more Hebrew than Italian. A new chaosh, at the village, stated that the place was built by Bahram Shah, and taken by Mushallem, a Muslim ; a story which the old ex-Mudir, my landlord, so far confirmed as to admit the capture. The fort is, at the south-east corner and eastern face, a ruin, or beyond a ruin, but there is trace of an old bastion. The south and south-western face may be 40 vards in length, with two towers. To the north, the ruined wall is looped for musketry, and being built up to the natural de fences, which are grand, presents an impregnable front. On the west is a gate, through which we entered, and over which are letters in Arabic or Turkish; but the side of the hill was too perpendicular to enable me to stand fronting and looking above ir, with sufficient freedom to decipher the inscription, even sup posing the words legible. Other remains here look interesting. « July 21.—After a delightful night passed in my own parti cular greatcoat, on a small raised wooden platform 111 ne verandah of a small house, away from all blankets, cushions, and borrowed bedding; march to Kara Maghara, the ac cave ' : 5 hours, but 18 miles.

Tlie graveyards are dotted with large, sharp, upright stones, marking the respective places of burial. The women, who show their faces more than usual, are not bad looking, but scarcely attractive. The children are handsome and ruddy. ' July 22. —Kohineh, or Kovneh, a Turkish and Armenian village, with more than 100 houses. There is the constant earthy, sombre appearance about the place; but it has a certain element of life to make it remarkable. We are put into an Armenian ironsmith's abode, and have a tolerable look-out through two windows into a kitchen garden. The windows have no glasses, but are of respectable dimensions, about 4 feet by 2^, with four rows of fancy wooden bars running down them, crossed at right angles through a square figure common to both. Our march to-day was over a fine, high tract of country, part of this vast plateau of Asia Minor, which we have so keenly ap preciated since reaching Sivas, its natural capital. There was an occasional descent into a valley, or lower plain. Observed much cultivation, but also much apparent waste land, probably dependent on dews in the absence of rain. Wheat backward. Halted for refreshment at Burun Eurun, and imbibed milk in a gay, painted chamber, in the presence of the Imam, and a large party of serious, hospitable Muslims. We have entered the ^uzgat district, called here ' kasaba,' which again is divided into nine ' kazas.' A Mudir rules the kaza, and a Kaim- makam, or similar officer of rank, the kasaba. 'July 23.—Yuzgat: 6 hours, or 18 miles; over a fine but rather mountainous country, enlivened by villages and streams. These large hilly basins are not wanting in verdure, or barren of trees, or cultivation ; but they have the mark of solitariness, and the traveller becomes impressed with a silence which feels unnatural as he wends his way through them. Even when a caravan passes, it seems to pass in quiet; and the fine air and climate, however delightful, fail to impart the cheeriness in spired by pleasant scenery. There is no looking from a distant height, upon a vast plain and its city, as at Sivas.

Bir Punghar, the title to guide the singers, is evidently the 1 unar, well, or ' fount,' and I believe myself correct in associating the words with the well-known ' There is a fountain filled with blood ; ' or one, at least, ol its versions adopted in our hymnals An exposition of Scripture followed, then another hymn, then a discourse and the final prayer. The preacher was fluent, and fervent. The singing, though not superior, was effective enough to produce that home thrill, that breath of retrospect, which many must have experienced, though few can describe its mysterious charm. There were three or four good faces among the boys ; but, with notable exceptions here and there, the con- giegation looked poor and unwashed. Some half dozen very respectable-looking men came up spontaneously after the service, to shake me by the hand as a new comer. Many boys were drowsy, some unsteady; but as a whole, the congregation was orderly and attentive.

How cheering and unlike the apparently truer experiences of the far East! To-day's march again impresses me with the sense of solitariness. There is something dreary in Asia Minor in spite of the many villages. These vast undulations of country covered with a pale yellow tint; relieved every now and then by plain or valley, where spots of fresher and brighter colour appear, and tall dark poplars disclose the site of garden or village ; these are but moderately enlivened by a joyous peasantry, or singing muleteers, or talkative travellers. While at Yuzgat, the telegraph Mudir had inveigled K. and me to a dugun or 'marriage feast' at a fiiend's or relative's. I can only say that it was worse than a repetition of the Italian doctor's entertainment; and that we left as soon as we could under the rules of the most ordinary politesse. Gutlak ought to be famous for ugly old women, if for nothing beside. ' July 2 C j . —Tsrael-li, a fair 7 hours, or 21 miles; and our first, really rainy march since leaving Baghdad. Heretofore wet weather had been confined to a smart shower or so, but to-day's rain was continuous. Pass many villages, and sight mountains, of which the more conspicuous are the Chichek and Danek Dagh. In three hours descend into comparatively broad plains. These Turkish villages differ little from those we had visited hitherto ; though they are, perhaps, smaller. The houses have now, most or many of them, wooden platforms open on one or two sides, which make capital sleeping quarters. The fleaa are not partial to wind and rain, nor do they affect the open air as the interior of Asiatic houses. Our way was to-day among some curious low hills of loose red earth. Visited by a Runu, (Greek), and some talk with a Nogai Tartar of characteristic features.

These Turkmans profess to be of the same family as those of Samarkand and Bukhara, the terror of the Persians, and to have settled here about 150 years ago. At the Deliji Su, cotton is growing in abundance on the left bank. I am told that 250 okas (687^ lbs.) are sold this year. At about halfway is the village of Karlangusht, at which no male inhabitants were visible, and the females did not seem disposed to be communicative. Shukuri failed in getting yoghurt, and said he was taken for a Circassian, a state ment which in some sense explains why we should be avoided. After passing Uusain Bey Ohbasi, find onr way to Hasan Bey Ohbasi, our stage, where we are put up in Hasain Bey's own house, which we are informed, and soon prove on experience, is thrown open to travellers by the hospitable owner. ' July 28.—Yakhshi Khan, or Yakhshan, 5| hours, or 16 miles. The muleteers' bells were heard at a very early hour: in fact, it was moonlight, and not a streak of dawn was visible. Yet we failed to start as early as intended, nor -was here any chaosh in attendance. A youth, dignified by the title of ' Wakil,' or Agent, presented himself as substitute for his father, the absentee, and was admitted to guide and enlighten us in the matter of the telegraph line. He w T as a pretty boy ; and his wild, flowing black hair burst forth bushily from beneath a very common fez, over shoulders covered by the loose red jacket of Asia Minor, on the back of which was a black em broidery in shape like a cross, and the sleeves of which were hanging down in hussar fashion. A fanciful red and spotted waistcloth was wound across his under-gown of yellow ground and many-coloured stripes. His bare leg was visible over his boots and leggings. Spear in hand, and mounted on a flea-bitten grey horse, he looked rollicking, jaunty, stupid and unimpressible, if such a combination can be rendered intelligible. Lett the road to follow the telegraph line, which takes its course over undu lating country and among luxuriant cultivated and ploughed fields. Cross to the right bank of the Kizil Irmak, before reaching our stage. Observed many fields of yellow wheat under the reap ing process, as we moved along to-day. Men and women rode h hHi 406 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap, donkeys to the work. The first sate heavily back and looked ungainly. The second, wearing white shift and unmentionables, and on the head a red cap bound round with a light kerchief, their long hair falling in plaits behind, looked well and Euth- like, as they tapped with their sickles the necks of the patient animals to increase their speed. An old chaosh with a shaved head, end otherwise Quixotic spear, as thoroughly comical and characteristic a figure as I had seen in Asia Minor, accompanied us into the station ; and well he did so, for we had dismissed our handsome but utterly useless boy attendant. ' July 29.—Hasan Oghlu, 6^- hours, or 19 miles. Re- crossed the Kizil Irmak, finding it up to the horses' girths. Traversed a rocky and mountainous tract to the descent to Kilinjer, a pretty picturesque village of some fifty houses, with a solid and regular look, and amid trees and cultivation. Observe two high mountains, W.S.W. Irma Dagh, and N. and by W. Idris Dagh. Hills again, and after another smart ascent and descent, sight in the gully to our right the villages of Yenikshik, 60, and a minor Yuzgat, above 100 houses. Halt at the fountain and horse-trough in the latter : but both these villages have a hideous and sickly garb, and we quit them readily for large fertile grain-fields, not yet under the sickle though awaiting the operation. This continued fertility is refreshing. The amber poppy and magenta thistle have lost their old colour and richness, but are seen as of old on this march. Part from old Bekir, the comical chaosh. ' July 30.—Angora, or Engureh, 6^ hours, or 20 miles. Move along a charming road through a valley between long ranges of hills. Pass a khan, water-mills, and rows of trees by the side of a brook. The cultivation becomes more and more luxuriant as we advance. We enter a new valley literally choked with corn, as well as trees in groves, lines, and clusters; sparkling with running water; replete with villages and cheer ful agricultural life. Scarcely turning away from this, we sight Angora rock and castle. About half way I had come upon a burial-ground where was a broken pillar, with a seemingly Kufic inscription, nearly opposite which, across the path, wasANGORA. 467 an unmisiakeable lion, sorely disfigured, but perfect enough to possess great value. I questioned an old labourer on the spot about these monuments. ' Baba,' said he, ' they are old : no one can read, no one can know anything about them.' The next time the old fellow addressed me, he applied the pilgrim's affix, Haji, and said ' llaji Baba:' but though full of friendliness, he was not full of information. Met by a large cavalcade which the Pasha very kindly sent out to meet and escort us in. Most hospitably and honourably received, excellently housed; and the Pasha's servants deputed to attend us at all hours. ' July 31.—Had intended to halt: but summoned by telegram to Constantinople with all speed. Determine thereupon to leave this morning after breakfast, and post at all events to Ismid, on the Sea of Marmora, about 210 miles. K. and the horses and servants can follow at leisure. ' The Turkish pronunciation of Angora would induce me to write 'Engureh.' In leaving it in its better known etymology I must premise that the accent is never thrown on the second syllable. Murray estimates the population at 20,000, a third ot whom are Armenians. This certainly does not appear an over statement. 1 What a mass of houses is there over that fort- crowned hill! Tt must be the southern aspect that we so much admired on riding round last evening, when the fort was divested as it were of the town, and stood out in real grandeur. The striking effect was not unlike that produced by one of the many beautiful views of the Castle in Edinburgh presented to the lounger in the neighbourhood, and on the level of Princes-street. Endeavour to get a short ramble among the local curiosities ; and an old Italian doctor, whose acquaintance I made yesterday ou arrival, sends his son to attend me. Just saw enough ot an old Roman ruin with Latin inscriptions, for which objects modern Ancyra is renowned, to wish to learn more about it; but have uo time for a closer inspection. 1 M. Perrot, estimating the population within the last ten years, ghes to Angora 45,000 inhabitants, of whom 25,000 are lurks, 12 ,1 )00 Aunenian Catholics, 4,000 Armenian non -Catholics, 3,000 Greeks, and 1,000 Jews.-— {Souvenir* d'un Voyage en Mineure. Paris, 1864.) H H 2r : I 4 1 , v ». lIllHjll ' But the classical or beautiful inanimate is not all that is here calculated to arrest the inquirer's attention. Angora has what may be called a determinate reputation for goats, and an indeterminate reputation for cats. To the truth of the first I can testify from the sight of the most lovely of their species- exquisite little caprioling quadrupeds of drooping, silky coats, admiration of which even the fatigue of a weary march could not restrain. As regards the cats, my experience of them is con fined to specimens shown in Europe : for not one could T find in Angora, where they told me I must be looking for the ' Van kedisi,' or cat of the Lake Van. ' The famous goats, producing a wool renowned over the world, abound in the vicinity of the town from which they derive their name. It is said that they are only tound within certain circumscribed limits, which may be defined as between the left bank of the Kizil Irmak and Sevri llisar, the latter place marking the most southerly point, and the Black Sea being the northern boundary. A space of 500 geographical square miles may here be assigned, from which removal would cause deterioration. It is represented to be a known fact that if transferred to the east bank of the Kizil Irmak, they suffer from the mal cle pays. Many are lost from exposure, but the losses are made up for by herding with common goats, and caste is supposed to be recovered in the third generation. The Angora goat gives, I have learnt, 1 one oka, or 44 ounces avoirdupois, of wool; and the quantity supplied throughout the wool region is estimated at from 350,000 to 400,000 okas, i .e. 902,500 lbs. to 1,100,000 lbs. From the same authority it appears that 40,000 okas (110,000 lbs.) are expended in thread manufacture in Asia Minor itself, of which more than half is sent to Holland, and 1 These particulars are the same as reported by me to the Government of India nine or ten years ago, and were obtained from the Journal de Constan tinople of September 5, 1864. It is well, however, to note that Mr. Consul Taylor says the Angora goats thrive ' wonderfully in the neighbourhood of Jazirah' on the Tigris ; and that the mohair obtained from them was bought up there in 1863 by native traders from Kaisaria and Constantinople to the amount of 20,000/.VIII.] IV A Y-W AN BERING IN ASIA MINOR. 409 8,000 to 10,000 okas (17,500 lbs.) are converted into home made shawls and stuffs. ' Take leave of all friends and start. The Pasha insists on sending four mounted soldiers with me on my journey, but after getting out a mile or tw T o, 1 manage to dismiss them and find myself alone with the suraji, or groom, who is judged indispen sable by the custom of the country. Reach Amir Yaman in about two hours, and Ayash in less than three hours afterwards. Large town in a mountainous tract, where I get a fresh horse and suraji. Between Ayash and Bei Bazar, grow wearied of the repeated stoppages of my companion, and push on inde pendently. Soon find myself quite alone : night sets in before I reach the stage ; I lose the track, and, mc voild, fairly be wildered. At length T make for a light at some distance off, and discover a party of people sitting round a fire. Doubtless my solar topee and general costume are strange to them, but they hear my story and respond to the appeal with which it closes. I offer a small silver piece (beshlik) for a guide to Bei Bazar, and a young lad is mounted on a steed and sent with me. 1 he place is about a couple of miles further. On the way the boy turns round and says: ' This beshlik is for me; what are you going to give the horse?' The appeal was irresistible; and I was glad to give two more beshliks before dismissing my guide, after he had safely lodged me at the posthouse for the night. Half-a-crown, under the circumstances, was not a heavy pay ment. Dined off grape soup and bread, and endeavoured to sleep in the posthouse verandah; but disturbed by the arrival of the dawdling suraji. Gave him his bakhshish, though far from pleased with his behaviour. Under fifty miles to-day. 'August 1.—Great delay in making a start, and have to get through eleven hours with dubious change of horses. Road partly over heavy sand and among high hills. Brief halt at a coffee- shop in Chair Kui, where I was not over hospitably entertained while paying my footing. One hour after leaving iNullakhan, the post station, came upon rich grain-fields ; in two hours, pass a halfway house ; in three hours is a water saw-mill; in four hours I make a considerable and very winding ascent to the: vlf ^ |l l - 'V; i : I Rtt II &lt; • teleghafu and travel. heights overlooking the Mudurli valley. Leave my suraji, whose horee is done up, and push forward. Reaching the summit of the wooded mountain, commence the long descent on the other side, and manage to make the post-town just before nightfall. Find the posthouse, a small building in a narrow street, but can nowhere procure a dinner! Somewhat faint from want ol food ; proceed to telegraph office; but return to beat up am kind of refreshment at a shop, and with the aid ot a chaosh. A greasy dish of eggs is offered, of which I partake sparingly, adding bread ; and then turn in to sleep in an open frontage looking into the street. I must not forget to record that after leaving Bei Bazar this morning I discovered that the suraji of the pre vious evening had taken advantage of my absence to help him self to the few eatables and drinkables that were to be found in the saddle-bags he was carrying on my particular account, and had especially disposed of every drop in my single bottle of sherry ! More than GO miles to-day. ' August 2—Start from Mudurli at an early hour, about 3 or 3.30, certainly before dawn. A cup of hot milk and a slice of bread is brought to me ere starting, and is most acceptable. This attention must be attributed to a little display of vexation on my part last night, when contrasting the good treatment I invariably received among Kurds and Arabs with that experi enced from the more civilized Turks of Asia Minor. It is not much I ask for—a bit of cheese or an egg to relieve the dryness of the bread about dinner time; and a loaf, or dry bread or biscuit, to eat on horseback for breakfast as we jog along. The nine hours' stage to Torbalu we manage to accomplish in about six hours, getting in at 10 a.m . The scenery from Mudurh to this place is beautiful; the road along a magnificent \ a ley flanked by forest-clad mountains. The wood is mostly r. Fields and forests emit a delicious perfume. Here and there are hedges such as those in dear old England. Get through two more stages, namely, Torbalu to Terekli, and lerekli to Garve i, each of six hours, making up twenty-one hours, or a good sixty- three miles for the day. So tired, that I am tolerably indifferen to the information that horses are not at once procuiable a Gaiveh. Besides, it is night when I arrive. This posting mVIII.] GOSSIP DE (WSSYPIO. 471 Asia Minor has its disagreeables, especially as regards tlie seat on horseback. They put one's British saddle on a thick native quilting, and not on the back of the horse ; consequently, the rider is immensely and most unpleasantly exalted. Galloping is painful; trotting is painful; the horse is uneasy, and the rider also, under the circumstances. On one occasion to-day, I had to dismount and get the whole affair re-arranged, the suraji re turning nearly a mile into Terekli to get what was required. Loss of time and temper ensue on these contretemps, and are all the more distressing if one is in a hurry. I had intended push ing on all night to catch the morning steamer leaving Ismid for Constantinople ; but wearied nature and exhausted patience disposed me to sleep at the Gaiveh coffee-shop, leaving instruc tions for an early start. ' August 3,—My night's rest at the coffee-shop, however, was not a long one, for several of its habitues persisted in sitting with me to discuss the American war, the late Chinese war, cotton, and electric telegraphs. One old man declared that were peace restored to America, Asia Minor cotton would no longer be sought after by England, but would drop from 2G to 6 or ] 0 piastres the oka (2f lbs.) To some extent lie is right. The value is sure to deteriorate when a poor market becomes an abundant one. But there may be room for both products; and if the Asia Minor cotton be good and susceptible of improve ment, there is no knowing for how long a period it may be purchased by English manufacturers. Gaiveh, where our dis cussion was held, is a great cotton-growing locality ; and our little parliament showed no small intelligence, especially in the person of one of its members. Before reaching Angora, I had been informed that in Kalaja Kirkin, a district in the pashalic or Jcasaha of Angora, near which I passed, no less a yield than 13,750 lbs. had been obtained—1 presume this last year. The impetus lately given to the cultivation had been most effective. Start early this morning, but are a long time about the six hours' march to Sabanja, a village with a fine lake, the view of which from the high ground on the Gaiveh side is very fine. From this place, after a short friendly chat, make a fresh start472 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. and get upon a broad dusty road well indented with ruts. Soon spy out the position of Ismid, and the hills forming the sides of its long gulf. Stop at a coffee-house about three-quarters of a mile out of the town, and hold a little talk with a lounger there. These roads, it should be mentioned, are sprinkled with devrans, or halting barns, where pipes and coffee are procurable, far away from towns or even villages. At Ismid, found a cafd and locanda, kept by a quasi-English Yice-Consul with a kind of Polish-Greek name. His son did the civil to me, and I put up there. Visited telegraph station. Sent over to the cook's shop and got chopped meat and vegetables, bread and wine; and thoroughly enjoyed the first approach to a dinner T had had since leaving Angora on the 31st ultimo, together with a quiet airy room in which to eat and sleep. About 40 miles to-day. ' August 4.—Ismid, the original Olbia, and subsequent Nico- media, the capital of Nicomedes, king of Bithynia. Mr. Walsh speaks of it in 1823 as having stood for 2,400 years on the same spot. The situation is certainly well chosen, and the coup d'atil from the sea charming. As usual in Turkish fashionable resorts near the capital, the Sultan's kiosk is the conspicuous object; and to make it exclusive, bis Imperial Majesty seems to have cleared himself an amount of eligible ground in the heart of a populous town, after a fashion which would elsewhere severely try the loyalty of the sufferers. Steamers run to and fro between Ismid and Constantinople almost daily; and the Sultan makes frequent visits here in one of his yachts or tenders.' J will now pause; for too much on Ismid and its history would be out of place at the close of a long and desultory chapter.

Under instructions from the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for India, I returned from Constanti nople to London in May 18G5 ; whence, after assuming a general superintendence of the Persian Gulf cable and Anglo-Persian land-line, so far as her Majesty's Govern ment was represented in the latter, I again set forth on the 23rd June, charged with a special mission to Tehran. A Convention was to be concluded with the Shah, in supersession of existing provisional arrangements for the conduct of the telegraph ; and I was to impart and be responsible for all details which her Majesty's Minister at the court of Persia might require to be put before him pending negotiations. Four days in Paris enabled me to confer with the Director-General of Ottoman telegraphs, Agathon Efendi, then on a special mission from Constantinople connected with the resilient question of Turkish finance ; as well as to accomplish work incidental to my charge, and pro posed journey. Au reste, the time was not one to choose for sight-seeing in this galere. The heau monde hadc '- IX -] CAR A PARIGI. 475 fled : the bourgeoisie were in the ascendant. Monceaux and St. Cloud were all very well in the way of crowds, of grottoes and waterworks ; but what they had to show, animate or inanimate, was of a most familiar kind. The Academic was open, and Marie Saxe and Faure were drawing fair houses to the ' Africaine,' with its impossible i&gt;rahmins and other clrctiiiatis 'pevsouoz ; but the weather was too hot, and there was too little attraction, to make theatres generally desirable to passers- by. That huge caravanserai, the Grand Hotel, so largely patronized by American travellers, was as full and un like a home as usual ; but the cafes, the restaurants, the boulevards, in fact all recognized Paris, wanted the verve, which makes it so pleasant a reminiscence to the many. When looking at this beautiful city as it is} I cannot avoid contrasting it with what it was, not half a century ago; when the Champs Elysees were a kind of out-of- town garden or promenade. There was a Beaujon there, 01 minor Vauxhall, where fireworks were exhibited at night, and the Montagues Busses amused loungers in the da). And the streets, how wonderfully improved, not only in width and architectural display, but in order and cleanliness ! The shops are brilliant in the extreme : the crowds of passengers on foot, and of vehicles, are increas ing : the pavement of the busiest thoroughfares is exqui sitely smooth and still. If Baron Haussmann has failed to please the Parisian, he has surely merited a statue from the cosmopolite. Much has been done of late years to beautify and improve London ; but we have not con nected our principal railway stations one with the other, i o\ e giound and through the metropolis, as they have 1 In 1865, before the war and its disastrous consequences.TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. done across the Channel, to the convenience of the million, if only to the taste of the hundred. The mind which designed the Rue Lafayette, and similar main streets, might have continued the few suggestive yards opened out by the North-Western Railway at Euston in one grand line of thoroughfare to Waterloo Bridge. This en passant, and irrespective of money or property con siderations. On the 28th June, I left Paris for St. Petersburg, and breakfasted the next morning at Berlin. The next morning I crossed the Russian frontier, and at four o'clock on the following afternoon I was dininor at the O O Russian capital ; thus accomplishing, in round numbers, some 1,750 miles in less than 80 hours, or 3^ days and 3 nisfhts. 1 O There was little worthy of record on the journey. Between Paris and Cologne, I found myself in a carriage with two smoking merchants, a lady and gentleman who might have been father and daughter, and a Hamburgher who, not content with asking me many substantial ques tions, answered others of an imaginary nature ; for I am not aware of having put them to him, and his replies were addressed with painful directness to myself. He told me of his family, his travels, that he was on his way home, and that there would be great joy on his return; subjects which one perverse nature is apt to put to another perverse nature at unfortunate seasons, when an appeal to sympathy is, at the least, ill-timed. Passing through Berlin, in the omnibus, it was my chance to hear a warm discussion between two fellow-passengers divided 1 In 1871 I made the journey from St. Petersburg to London in much the same time ; and in 1872 the improved railway communication in Russia enabled me to reach London from Persia in 13 days.1X J CONTINENTAL RAILWAYS. 477 in opinion on France and Germany, both as to towns and inhabitants. One was loud for French, and one for German soldiers. In considering Prussia as a military nation, it was questioned whether the military spirit had ree action under the influence of pipe-clay, and whether over-attention was not paid to the dress and tenue of the soldier All the railway stations, for instance, turn out soldierly-looking officials, many admirably dressed men, and the duties are performed with great militarv prccision and discipline : but was this the class of heroes for war? and had they the of the rough, ready, nnd slipshod Zouave or Turco ? On the other hand France was criticized for her want of solidity and in ordinate love of display. To me it seemed that there might be some reason and truth on each side of the ques tion: but I little dreamt of the practical solution to be publicly proclaimed, a few years later, to at least one phase of the discussion.

We were waiting in the refreshment room the signal to re-enter the car riages. Among other characters on which attention could not fail to rest, the typical idler of the continental buffet was not wanting. Here it was illustrated in the person of a military dandy, whose local status was pro bably derived from a garrison at or near the frontier. He was talking affable French to a lady behind the counter, who should nevertheless be a countrywoman of his own ; and every now and then he turned to twist his particularly long whiskers d la Dundreary before the looking-glass in the most self-satisfied manner. His light-coloured cloak was opened at the throat just sutii- ciently to display a small star and medals ot brilliant hue. He seemed to know everybody, and to take a kind of superintendence of everybody he knew, and all that belonged to them. A huge dog alarmed an old lady who was talking long and earnestly in French to a pale, gentlemanly boy about ten or eleven years old. Here it must be recorded in favour of the smart officer, that, although evidently disposed to regard the circum stance jocosely, a sense of propriety prevailed, and lie turned the offender out of the room. As we passed through Wilkowitchki and Pilwitchki on the way to the larger towns of Kovno and Wilna, I was struck with the scant population. At Duuaburg a pica sant companion, a Russian officer, left me to proceed to Riga.

They are well supplied with letters, as for instance Deben- skaya and 1 icobrejenskaya, and may be checked with a continental Bradshaw. At this said Preobrejenskaya the only object that attracted my attention was a very plain, far tar-faced lad with fine large roses wreathed round his shabby hat, which seemed, moreover, to have a broad plume sticking out of it. Another pleasant companion, who spoke English and French as well as his native Russian, left me at Gachina between the Lake 1 skofi and St. Petersburg. The whole country up to the capital is monotonous and triste to a degree. On the recommendation of the fellow-traveller lust alluded to, I drove to Miss Benson's on the English Quay, whither I was conveyed under the particular in- structions of a polite old warrior at the railway station, whose breast carried a full battery of medals. The abode in question is of the nature of a private hotel or hoarding-house, and, though not in any way pretentious, better suits the taste of an English traveller passing through the Russian capital than do the larger and more orthodox establishments, which are at best second-class compared to those of Paris and Western Europe. At all events 1 had a tolerably large bedroom wherein to wash and dress in peace, fitting myself before long to enter a dioseliky and drive to her Majesty's Embassy. Here a se ^ at e German-speaking porter informed me that the Ambassador was absent from St. Petersburg ; it was too hte in the day to expect the further attendance of any secretary; so leaving a few lines for the Charge duff aires I returned to my quarters, joining a table dhdte with our hostess at one end, her sister at the other.. ffiiH 'm ' ; iim : (! i i vr ! 1 1 j --■i I and some three or four lodgers sitting sparsely here and there. The day following that of arrival was Sunday, and I attended divine service in a very well-arranged building. It contained a vivid Descent from the Cross as an altar picture, and other appropriate accessories to church ornament. The congregation was not numerous oi, perhaps, aristocratic. Many of its members had a semi- Russian appearance, and reminded me of the Levantine element observable in the Embassy chapel at Constan tinople : but the fashion of St. Petersburg was out of town, and it is presumed that British Protestantism had representatives in that particular sphere who were doomed or pleased to follow suit, ihe chaplain was a good reader, and preached a good sermon on the words ' The sword of the Lord and of Gideon,' showing that man must use his own efforts as well as look 'to the hills' for help. On Monday, agreeably to appointment, I accompanied her Majesty's Charge d'affaires to the house of the Rus sian Minister for Foreign Affairs. Mr. L. had very kindly and promptly procured me the honour of an interview, and had taken the trouble to discuss with me previously the question of the overland telegraph to India, hi which he expressed much interest. This gentleman s reports and investigations on the important subject of Central Asian traffic were such that for personal appre hension of the objects of the Indo-European telegraph, I could not well have addressed myself to a more fitting medium. The Minister received me with cordiality, conversed freely on ordinary topics, both in Inench an English, and referred me to a secretary for any detaile information 1 might require.'X.J PUCK'S GIRDLE. 481 Prince G. is rather tall, somewhat inclined to stout ness, has a high forehead, grey hair, and ruddy com plexion.

He did not envy me my journey to Persia, facetiously requesting that if I fell sick, it should be beyond Russian territory, or out of the range of his responsibility. On Tuesday I called on the Director-General of Im perial telegraphs, and broke ground on the departmental details of international traffic. Without putting forward any definite proposals, or even suggesting a definitive understanding, I thought it well to generate, as it were, free and friendly interchange of ideas on a matter of mutual interest and universal benefit, in which political mistrust or jealousy had necessarily no part whatever. Indeed, I could not reasonably have done more, even if authorized. Some facts, such as the tariff and state of the line, it was imperative to ascertain, unless we were to ignore the Russian route altogether, which the bad working of the Turkish wires alone rendered inexpedient. General G. is a dark, middle-aged, wiry-looking man of fair height and build; inclined to be lean rather than stout, and of an Italian middle-class physiognomy. He is very go-ahead, wants telegraphs all over the world, and all at a cheap rate. He told me they were hard at work at the line connecting the Amoor with Russian America, and that when the Americans joined on, they hoped to encircle the world. This was their part: ours the Indian and Atlantic cables; all grand efforts, under Providence. This interview completed the little inci- i i482 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

St. Petersburg on this tirst visit did not charm mc. It o;ave ft*® the notion of a mass of houses set down in a wilderness, and ranged along a river and its canals, rather than a leading city of Europe. It seemed as though we had entered it without the usual preparation, such as suburbs and paved approaches ; and when in it, I missed the civilized finish which might have been an ticipated. Perhaps it was this feeling of disappoint ment which blinded me to many beauties, and caused me to exaggerate defects rather than find cause foi im perfection. But my first impressions of St. Petersburg were certainly not so favourable as those obtained from after visits. It put me in mind of New York, in the driving of its coachmen, the passage of its tramwa} cars, and in other outward tokens; but for the strangei traveller a Fifth A venue Hotel was wanting in the pic ture. The shops struck me as inferior to those of London.

The cathedral of St. Isaac stood out simple and grand ; the statue of Peter the Great looked full of life and beauty; the palaces had architectural elegance as well as solidity. It was the perpetual stucco, which was too profuse and palpable; and the streets am squares were disproportionately wide, while the pay ment was really wretched. A delicate person, at the mercy of a fiery droschky-driver, would have been jolted into irrecoverable ailments; a stout person 111'*•] ST.

Then again, in the droschky there was only just room for one, and this one should have been able to hold on by both hands at any time ; but the denizens of St. Petersburg seemed fond of driving in couples. A man and his chere (imie, he holding her with deft firmness round the waist; this was no unusual national picture. I might say more, but the city has been described by those who have lived there and are acquainted with its in terior as well as exterior aspect; and these first im pressions were derived from a four days' imperfect consideration of the latter. The Petersburg-Moscow Railway Station is a large, handsome building; and luggage is weighed and tickets are given by the Imperial army much in the style adopted by civilians elsewhere, except that the military aie perhaps more alive to what are commonly called 'tips.' I found myself in a carriage with two men, who might be Russian or Hungarian. Not entering into any conversation with them, I tried to read a ' Petit Manuel de la Langue Russe,' but soon fell off to sleep. The heat was intense, as it had been during my short stay at the capital, where, by the way, the very brief nights at this season of the year cannot fail to surprise the stranger to extreme northern latitudes. Had it not been for the frequent stoppages, and inducements to get out and refresh on our road, of which the natives are not slow to avail themselves, I should probably have slept longer than I did. Our route lay through the pro vinces or ' governments ' of Novgorod and Twer. The 1 1 248i TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. country was green and wooded ; there were rivers and bridges, and highly respectable railway stations. The tables d'hdte were better than I expected to find, and the time given to profit by them was ample; but 1 could not keep pace with my companions in feeding and liquoring, and my ten o'clock supper consisted of a cigar and a lump of eating chocolate. At 8 a.m . the next day we reached Moscow. I had intended not to remain here more than a lew hours, but a slight attack of indisposition, and intima tion that the Astrakhan boat would not leave Nijm for two or three days, led me to defer my departure till the afternoon of Friday the 7th July. I had been recommended to the H6tel Billet, and went there ac cordingly. It is conducted, like Miss Benson's, on the private hotel or boarding-house principle, and Madame Billet is an Englishwoman. On the opposite side o the street is a rival house, strangely alike in designation, for it is kept by M. Billot, whose name it bears. A solitary stroll in the afternoon of the day enabled me to inspect the exterior of the palace and the sur rounding gardens of the Kremlin ; to admire a speaking bronze statue of Menin and Pojarsky within the walls, and specially note a singular Tartar-looking structure explained to be the Church of St. Basil, built by van the Cruel. The miniature domes and blue tints ot tins last are very striking, and the coup d'ceil of the w 10 e is charming. The next day, accompanied by an un avoidable commissionnaire, I visited the interior o Kremlin. Some of the apartments are gorgeously ntte up ; the throne-room being prominent and unique. '' pictures are well worth inspection, and boast ongina of first-rate artists. I lighted on one said to eIX. j MOSCO W. 485 Rembrandt, but which 1 myself might have innocently accepted as the work of a British artist: for it looked Hogarthian.

In the large hall are four fine paintings illustrative of the life of Alexander Nevsky, great bell of moscow. ^nd a grand specimen of quite recent art, representing a severe battle between the Russians and Tartars.

[chap. the apartments in the Kremlin; but perhaps the Tartar orientalism is the most memorable feature of the place. Concentrating attention in a corner full of quaint and tasteful designs, it would be easy to imagine oneself in a pavilion of the Great Khan. There is a fine view from the terrace, especially in the direction of the arsaw road with the intervening gold-domed Clmrcli of the Saviour. The rooms in the palace were filled with old soldiers wearing gold chevrons, each of which indicated five years' service. One man had nine medals on his breast, inclusive of stars and crosses. The ribbons explanatory of these are seemingly drawn across a plate of metal, secured by a long pin; or the plate itself, if such it be, is coloured to represent the ribbons. I should have liked to ' tip ' all these veterans, but there were too many; so a rouble for the principal conductor was held sufficient. In the Emperor's bedroom was a small altar, most elaborately filled with paintings and ornaments. The ' government' of Moscow, though one of the smallest of the provinces of Great Russia in actual area, has perhaps the largest population. More than ten vears a^o it was estimated at above a million and a half. • i i • No doubt the city accounts for a vast number of inhabi tants. I was informed that it contained no less than 400 churches, and that the rule was to allot a church or chapel to every Government building. There are also some monasteries and convents. The English Protestant church is a quiet edifice, capable of accommodating least a hundred : it has one small altar-painting of the Saviour. The chaplain had left on the very day of ni) visit, and the churchwardens knew nothing of the ap pointment of a successor. Judging from the streets andIX.] MUSCOVITE MUJJIKti. 487 highways in Russia, the visitor whose wanderings have heretofore been confined to the western half of Europe may be pardoned for recording a strong impression of the plainness of the inhabitants. Certainly the men and women observed here in outside life and society are, as a rule, not handsome ; and the general appearance of the mujjiks and drivers of public vehicles, who abound in the two cities of fet. Petersburg and Moscow, is primi tive and graceless. A hat like a chimney-pot or inverted flower-pot with invisible brim, exemplifies a very pre vailing fashion in Moscow; the shabbier, the more characteristic it is. One of broad brim and lower crown often adorns the hirsute visage of the togated, upper-class coachman, who, but for his boots and head gear, would exhibit a get-up resembling the liveries of the Presidency grandees of India. His state robe is encircled at the waist by a shawl or belt similar to theirs, and he is not wanting in the air of solemn vacancy so befitting the aristocratic ' Gariwala.' As for the females, I believe that the Muscovites themselves Avould acquit me of undue national prejudice in award ing the palm to a countrywoman of my own. Amono- those whom I saw in the town, my hostess was assuredly tlie belle. It will be contended that, as regards men and women, I am only speaking of those who show themselves abroad at the most unfashionable of seasons : consequently of the lower, and, in physical parlance, less- favoured classes. The observer's experience of the ' upper ten thousand' would, clearly, give a very different result. At the ' Billet' table dhote, I made the acquaintance ot a pleasant Dutch gentleman, who w T as to be accom panied on his travels, at least as far as Baku on the433 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. Caspian, by a second gentleman fioni Riga. A third whom I also met might have been German or Italian. We conversed on Baghdad and on Muhammadan ruins; and a conviction clung to me that we had foregathered elsewhere, more than a thousand miles fiom Moscow, perhaps in India. Bidding farewell to my host and hostess I started at 5 p.m . on the 8th July for Nijni Novgorod, which place I reached by rail at about eight the next morning. But a word on the journey. I was put into a good first- class carriage on the German and French system. Shortly after, a strange-looking old man of Jewish physiognomy, and with a long white beard, was brought in by a young man of the poorer class, who spread his bed and waited on him. They had between them a large amount of dirty, loose luggage, much of it in bundles. Ihe old man lay mumbling, and I thought was an invalid; but a Russian officer sitting opposite me seemed to read my thoughts, and informed me he was drunk! Other pas sengers entered the carriage, and one of them, regard ing the aged Bacchanalian as an intruder, protested against his retention, and obtained his removal—a measure achieved with some difficulty by the military and railway staff. Some conversation with the officer followed. He was an engineer of high standing, boun to Astrakhan, short, jovial, cigar-smoking, German by birth, and able to talk English and French tolerably, clean-shaved, comfortable Russian, also in our carriage, spoke French with great fluency, and asked me many questions on India, and our ways and customs there to all of which I replied with as much frankness an little diplomacy as I thought compatible with common sense. This same gentleman was most kind in ai 111 Six. j N1JN1 NOVGOROD. 489 me at the railway station at Nijni Novgorod, where he procured a droschky, arranging with the driver to take me to Niquita's hostelry for 1 rouble and 25 kopecks (about four shillings iiaiglish)—not a heavy charge for a very long drive, involving a ferry across the water. I must not forget the Orekhovskaia cotton-mills passed between Moscow and Vladimir, to which the attention of travellers, whose time is their own, might be turned with advantage. The place has a working and busy appearance. Nijni Novgorod is situated on a high promontory marking the junction of the Oka and Volga, and on the right bank of either river. To reach the town, the traveller from St. Petersburg crosses the Oka, and its breadth at this point can be but little less than that of the better known stream in which its own identity be comes thenceforward absorbed. The quay, a compara tively modern construction, devised, according to M. de Custine, to remedy the mistake of the founders of Nijni in building a town upon, or rather behind, the high ground, was in the roughest of states when I was con ed alon 0 it. A rapid rush through Dublin, with unsteady luggage, in an outside car, to catch a train, would be a joke to the drive I then had with my poor wild droschky man. We had, both of us, to hold on by the portmanteaux at times, and once we might have rolled over the bank into the river without any difficulty, before us was a restive team, aggravating the ordinary clanger; but neither did the vehicle it drew or its pas sengers come to grief. Niquita's was more of a cabaret or tavern than a hotel. but I got fairly treated there. Despite of greasy soup a plate of capital fish with sauce piquante, a wildTELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. duck, an ice, and a pint of Chateau Lafitte. made up a satisfactory dinner; and though the sleeping-berth looked rather queer, it was neither lively nor uncomfortable. Some restless party in the room adjoining was heard as if rolling about in bed, or constantly getting out of it and in again ; but 1 am not aware that we met face to face. In the morning I was visited by an Italian, who offered his services. Liking his looks, I gave him employment for an hour or so as guide, in default of a more lasting engagement. Early in the afternoon, I found myself on board the Volga steamer. The remainder of the journey to Tehran will perhaps be better described by extracts from a rough diary; but reserving these for a separate chapter, I venture upon a brief digression which it is hoped will be found excusable in illustration of Kussian hospitality and courtesy to strangers. I have already instanced one or more cases of travelling politeness, and may have yet a stronger instance or so to place on record in the course of the current narration. Opportunity is now taken to bring forward a personal reminiscence of the Crimean War, which, although once embodied in print, 1 may not have been generally read or known. Such an episode appears more appropriate to the present chapter than the relation of any special experiences of Russia or of Russian life and character acquired in recent years. For of three passages through Russia, including two visits to St. Petersburg and Moscow, effected since the journey now described, I shall have occasion to make some general use as the volume progresses. It was about the middle of December 1855. We 1 See a paper in Colburn's United Service Magazine for November and December 1857 and January 1858, entitled 'A Visit to the Tcherna -Moisky Cossacks.'IX.] EPISODICAL. 491 were at Kertch, in the Eastern Crimea, bokliiig the town chietiy with a Turkish garrison. A few miles from us, at Yenikale, was her Majesty's 7lst Regiment; at a less distance in the opposite direction was a detachment of our French allies :— ' Rumours of the enemy's presence in the neighbourhood be came rife, and the report of a patrol having made its appearance a few miles to the southward was ere long verified by the French Chasseurs, who discovered a body of supposed Russian hussars at the village of Shorabash, distant about fifteen versts, or twelve miles, south-west, from our head-quarters. No harm was done beyond the exchange of a few shots, the respective parties keep ing at a respectable distance from each other. This naturally put everyone on the qui vive, especially as we had at this time just sent out more than a hundred Turkish cavalry with a hundred infantry, to cover foragers at a place called the ' Spanish Farm,' situated six miles west of Kertch. The said farm contained a large supply of hay, which, after coquetting about for some days, we at length found necessary to appropriate on certain war terms made with the owner (Spanish consul at Odessa), through his Crimean agent. A la guerre comme a la guerre: it was not of the best description for our purpose, but would prove at all events useful during the existing and impending scarcity. Owing to the apparition at Shorabash, which is little more than six miles south of the farm, the detach ment was further strengthened by 200 infantry. Though the enemy were not visible in any strength to the videttes, intel ligence was brought to the officer commanding at the farm, that the Russians w r ere combining troops preparatory to some forward movement; and names of places were mentioned where the men were collecting. Our chef-de-'police, told a different story, but it was resolved to keep on the alert, the principle of never slumbering at our posts before the enemy. On Sunday the 16th December (the Cossacks were partial to disturbing us on Sundays), a Tartar came in and reported that492 TELEGRAPH AND TEA VEL. [chap. our cavalry had at length met the foe in earnest. His tale wag a contused one—he was panting and frightened. All the par ticulars that could be gathered were that a party of Turkish horsemen had left the farm in the morning to reconnoitre, and had fallen in, at some distance off, with a large body of Cos sacks, with whom they were, at the time he left, hotly engaged. The Tartars, he said, had fought valiantly in support of their Turkish brethren, lie and a comrade had been sent to give notice of what had happened. His comrade's horse had fallen on the way, and he had returned alone. On that same evening more than one of us rode out to the detachment and learned the particulars from the gallant officer who had commanded the handful of cavalry in question, and of whom nearly half were still missing. They had gone out to reconnoitre, had success fully skirmished with a body of Cossacks whom they had en countered on the way, and were eventually overpowered by a vastly superior number who had been concentrated in the vicinity; and some two score, under the commandant, had cut their way through the ranks of their opponents, effecting an orderly retirement to the farm. The British leader had been slightly wounded in the neck, but his belt bore the mark of more than one lance-thrust. His brave young subaltern had been severely wounded, and was in the hands of the enemy. A Turkish Yuzbashi (or captain) had been killed on the field. Beyond a certain number of missing, little else of actual loss was known. Several of the enemy were reported killed and wounded. ' The day following it was arranged that a flag of truce should be sent to the enemy's camp, in order that the number of killed, wounded, and prisoners on our side should be correctly ascer tained. It was my fortune to be named for this duty. In the afternoon I set out for the Spanish farm, and joined the officers of the detachment at mess, as my instructions were to start from thence in the morning. . ^ «The four companions with whom I shared the sleepmg- apartment that night will acquit me of indulging in a mereIX.] EPISODICAL. 493 fagon de parler in talking of the rats and mice, or both, by fifties or hundreds. Over the body, in at the boots, into pockets of pantaloons and pantaloons themselves, in the hair of the head—skipping, singing, screeching—scarce are the lights put out, than these inmates of the Spanish farm seek all the nooks of sleeping humanity within reach, and treat their pos sessors with no more respect than if they were cheese or candles. In vain is the stick at work—in vain are the arms and legs set in active motion—in vain does one holloa with stentorian power ; they will no more ' move on' than the street-singer or organ-grinder, except to return at the shortest notice. The dawn of day was grateful. I jumped up, hastily added such few essential articles of equipment as were not already on, and proceeded to muster my retinue. We were twelve in all, viz.:— six Turkish troopers, a French servant of the wounded officer, my own Arab groom, a Tartar guide, a young German who spoke Russian, an Assistant-Surgeon of the force, and myself. A spare pony accompanied to bring up stray baggage, and in case of need. ' It was a cold, frosty morning. I allowed my escort swords and pistols only as weapons, and one lance to carry the flag of truce. The Turk does not sling his carbine on the back, the more convenient and soldierly method for long marches, A Cossack was observed on one of the small hills overlooking the farm. He appeared to be watching our movements, but did not wait the approach ot the Turkish day vidette, whose usual post he was occupying. e started at about 8.30 a.m ., at a slow pace, taking the path below, and following the hills which incline W. and S.W. After proceeding for about a mile or more, we turned to the higher ground near a ruined village, and struck off in a due southerly direction towards the plain country, to meet the post-road from Kertch to KafTa. This was in accordance with the orders given, hut contrary to the suggestions of the guide, who wished me to adopt a more direct route to Akkoz, or Sultan Ovka, the fifteen- niile posthouse. As it was, we did not reach this point for three or four hours. Here we watered our horses, and ques-41)4 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL [chap, tioned some Tartar horsemen on the probability of falling in with the Cossacks up the high road. They were not so communi cative as might have been wished, but we determined to push on and take our chance. It must have been at about one in the afternoon that we first sighted the enemy's outposts. There was a long embankment from the high ground on either side the road, running at right angles to the road itself, where it ceased, and left a clear space lor traffic and travellers. This embankment, about the height of a tall man, resembled an ordinary Indian 'band,' defining a canal, tank, or field; and more than one of the same character, and of considerable antiquity, might be traced in the environs of Kertch. It seemed to imply territorial division, and may have been used in ancient times for defensive purposes. On the hillock to the right, I observed a cluster of horsemen which T conjectured might be a cavalry picket. Some two or three descended to the level ground on the inner side of the embankment, and leisurely crossed the road. There was a long, low, level ridge to the left, parallel to the road. Upon this it struck me that there might be a chain of posts, for one man started off apparently to com municate with some party or parties in the interior, and on the same line. I proceeded slowly to the passage between the two embankments, where I halted. It seemed as though we had arrived at the acknowledged boundary, and that this was the proper place for parley | but no herald appeared, and so mc passed through. The horsemen became now more scattered, and crossed or approached the road one at a time, or by twos or threes, but all at a respectful distance, quite out of hail. On the inner side of the embankment was a ditch sufficiently broad and deep to shelter cavalry, who would be able to raise them selves in the stirrup and fire over the earthy parapet at an advancing foe. ' It was evident that we were among the Cossacks, and hai not only reached, but passed one ot their outposts. 1 hat the} saw us there could be no doubt. W e were especially con spicuous in our varied costumes. Save the six sowars (Tuiki&amp;h cavalry), no two but were almost wholly unlike, while u ,,11(ix.] EPISODIC A L. 495 could be said to wear the actual dress of his country. For instance, the poor Frenchman was made up in the shreds and patches of a reckless Levantine ; the Arab's garments were as much Frank as Turkish, but had nothing of Syria, Egypt, or Mecca ; the interpreter had something the appearance of the foreign Ambassador in the ' Horse of the Cavern' at Astley's; the Tartar would have been orthodox had we not taken him into British clothing as well as pay; the doctor wore his ' Contin gent ' uniform, which is saying enough for its singularity; and [ myself, in addition to uniform, had a French capote and high fur boots, which would have been remarkable under any circum stances. We were moreover doubly conspicuous from our posi tion in an open road, the only objects there discernible. 'We may have gone on about a furlong when I pulled up again. There were two Cossacks to our right front whose atten tion I determined to attract if possible. Accordingly, halting the party in the road, 1 took the flag-bearer and interpreter with me and gave chase across country. The horsemen crossed me and made for the road. Thither, with a correspond ing movement, I returned, inclining towards the point which they themselves seemed bent upon reaching. Perseverance gained the desired end. On coming to the road they paused in their course and watched us. I held out signals of parley, response was made, and we were motioned to advance. In another five minutes we were on the most friendly terms with our new acquaintance; in ten, our whole party were moving together, under their escort, towards the village where w r e were to await a reply to the request made in the letters of which I was bearer. 'The principal spokesman was a tall, stalwart man, under the middle age, with a pleasing expression of countenance. He entered into earnest conversation with the interpreter on the subject of the recent skirmish, asked many questions regarding the Turks and ourselves, and replied to the numerous interro gatories put to him on our side. Chietly was I desirous to ascertain the fate of the British officer and the surviving pri soners. They were all at Arginn, the second post-station, about496 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. fl:| '■ !v T|% thirty miles from Kertch, and, from what we could gather, doing well. Three troopers had died of their wounds. ' These were the Tcherna-Morsky, or Black Sea Cossacks. They wore the long grey coat and trousers, with red facings and shoulder cords, the latter showing the number of the regiment as well as the button. The cap was red at the skull, bordered with deep fur, not unlike the ' kalpak' in use with the Tartars. Indeed, in the distance it is difficult to distinguish the mounted Tartar from the mounted Cossack, owing to the similarity of head-gear. The belt contains pistols and knives, and the fire lock is slung across the back. The officer's curved sword has no guard at the hilt. The horses are sturdy, but small, and the rude high saddles are as primitive as oriental. As we proceeded onward, our party was every now and then strengthened by a stray cavalier. The new arrivals were inquisitive, but never impertinent. One of our Turks was recognized as having borne a part in the affair of the 16th. This circumstance showed us that our escort had been recently our immediate and actual enemy. ' After a desultory ride of some six or seven miles, never forsaking the highway, we arrived at the Tartar village of ' Kar- mitch xelitchi' (the Russian orthography). Like most Tartar villages of any pretensions, it had one or two buildings of a better order, but the greater part of the habitations were little better than huts of loose, irregular stone walls, and substantial roofing. On the right, and immediately behind the houses, were two abrupt hillocks, between which was a narrow pass. The Frenchman called my attention to a number of Cossacks dis cernible, as he said, through this opening. ' Regardez-y un peu, Monsieur: on les voit bien la derriere!' There might have been an army there to garrison ' the glen At once with full five hundred men,' but I doubted the fact. It would have been a bleak encamp ment, and with no conceivable object.

A heavy snowstorm was threatening, and we were glad to get shelter for our cattle as well as ourselves. In about half an hour, or be tween three and four p.m ., a cavalcade was seen approaching. At their head rode a lieutenant-colonel of the 2nd regiment of Tcherna-Morskys, dressed much in the same way as his men, the cartridges arranged d la Circassunne, that is, obliquely across his breast, on either side, not unlike a double set of Pandean pipes. With him was a medical officer in a dark blue uniform, with the usual long Russian uniform coat and stiff forage-cap, the only relief to which was a narrow red binding. They both received us with kindness and civility; but it was evident that we were to go no further until ' further orders.' This, to say the least, was somewhat disheartening, for the prisoners were only fhe miles off, if indeed so much; and the accounts of my poor friend, the officer, were anything but satisfactory. We were taken to a small Tartar lodging. Entering at a kind of kitchen or wash-house, from thence we passed into a side room on the left hand. This contained a plain sofa, about eight feet in length, a table, a few chairs or stools, and a sort ot ' buffet, and was evidently the reception-room ot strangers. Here we all sat down and proceeded to business.* I delivered my letters in due form, one for the commandant of the outposts (opened by the lieutenant-colonel himself), one for the general commanding the Russian troops in the Eastern Crimea. Both documents set forth the object of my visit, namely, to learn the fate of the missing officer and men, and their wants, if any, which could be supplied by us ; a medical officer had accompanied the flag of truce, in case his services should be available for the wounded. I added my own request for per mission to proceed to Arginn, as I was so close at hand, to be the better able to make a satisfactory reply to my superiors. The lieutenant-colonel protested that, for his part, he had not the power to let me continue my route so far, but informed me that it 1 would wait until tiie following morning, he would doubtless be enabled not only to obtain an answer to the letter for his general, but also a definite permission or refusal to pro- K KTELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. ceed myself to Arginn. Though not instructed to remain for a reply to the letter in question, it seemed that my own request involved the success of so material a part of my mission, that I could not well do otherwise than await its result. The evening O was too far advanced to admit of my taking back at once the whole party, weary and hungry withal, from a long ride, with unrefreshed cattle, and through a snowstorm. I should not omit to mention that, as regards accepting any extraneous medical aid for the wounded, it seemed a point of honour not to enter tain the notion. 'After the lieutenant-colonel had completed and forwarded his despatches, he insisted on undertaking the duties of host. He had taken particular account of the number of my horses and followers, and given orders for their subsistence; and he now wished to do the honours of hospitality to the inmates of the lartar domicile. We were three strangers: the interpreter, the assistant-surgeon, and myself. The two last sat on the long sofa, the first on a seat facing it; a low table, somewhat larger than a garden stool and less than an Indian ' teapoy,' being placed between us. It just contained the dish of the course, and the bottle for general circulation. I speak in the singular number, for we all ate and drank in common; that is, soup out of the same bowl, meats or sweets out of the same dish, and wine or spirits out of the same glass. Our host and the Kussian doctor occupied places close beside us, but excused themselves from joining in the repast, as they had either already dined or were to dine at Arginn. The latter spoke very good French and we managed to get on famously. The worthy Cossack could barely recall a tew words in that tongue; but his good- looking rotund face, burly person, and merry twinkling eye, told me that we only required a common language to be on equally excellent terms. They left us at an early hour, promising to supply the required intelligence in the morning, and with many apologies for the poorness of our accommodation. ' is to be feared that, in spite of Cossack civility, an absurd idea of comfort caused me to congratulate myself on having the room for the rest of the night to our three selves. If indeed soEPISODIC A L. 490 I must have experienced a little disappointment on finding a new character appear on the scene in the person of a lieutenant of the 2ii(l Tcherna-Morskys, 1 his was to be our permanent host, and he introduced himself accordin^ly, through the medium of our interpreter. Tall, upright, cropped, 0 clean- shaved, save in the moustache, dressed in the plain uniform of his regiment, he was the true impersonation of the Russian subaltern of Cossacks. The face was that of the bronzed campaigner; he need scarcely have told us that his better years had been passed in Circassian warfare. He breathed of the C aueasus, of Crimean and Circassian outposts. But hn was withal a jovial, well-meaning soul, and played the part of entertainer with the most military exactitude. ' He was not of the noblesse,' he took care to inform us: 'nothing but a plain, blunt soldier, fond of his glass and his meal. Though accustomed to night-work out of doors, he had no objections to a pipe and a fire within; and he was rather thankful to ns than otherwise that our presence had procured him the exchange of a comfortable seat by a stove for the back of a horse in the snow. But he feared we should find him an unpolished host, in spite of the best and most hospitable intentions.' ' Notwithstanding pressing requisitions to eat and drink up to any amount, we turned in at an early hour. My companion, 1 he assistant-surgeon (who took greatly with the Cossacks), and I shared the long sofa, each claiming an end, and inclining our legs right or left at the place of meeting, according to circum stances. The lieutenant and interpreter made up comfortable enough beds on the ground; two or three Cossacks and the Tartar owners of the house filled up the blank spaces. We must iave held as many as any respectable 'licence to contain' would admit of, on such state occasions. 1 slept much better that night than on the previous one at the farm. There were no rats to disturb one; and the day's work »ad made us all tolerably sleepy.

After this, could T refuse the proffered comb, with a valet supporting the looking-glass, as he had done the basin ? These arrangements completed, there was little else than to buckle on a stock, pull on a pair of boots, and imbibe a morning glass of raid, to make us ready for breakfast. ' After the morning's meal, I began to grow impatient for tlie arrival of a messenger from Arginn. My Cossack friend of the day previous was to return himself; but this step would almost appear needless were I allowed to continue my route at once. Towards midday, intelligence arrived that an officer of rank (a prince) was on his way to visit me, and would bear the general's instructions for my after guidance. It was contrary to my intention to lose time thus, but there now appeared to be no remedy ; for, had I returned to Kertch, I had no list of prisoners, and no actual knowledge of their condition or wants, to take back with me, whereas a half-hour would bring me to the spot where all were now stationed. I could then ascertain from my brother officer's own lips what were his wishes and requirements; and they might allow me a few minutes' conversation to the same effect with the Turkish troopers. I resolved, therefore, to await the appearance of the delegate from Kaffa. The lieutenant redoubled his attentions, and did all he could to kill my time in the manner most agreeable to myself. In some way or other—what with a little talk in one's own language between the assistant-surgeon and myself (the only two Englishmen of the party); interpreted dialogues w T ith our host; an unlimited supply of tea and other creature comforts (so frequent as to endanger the truth of their appellation)—the day did pass until a French note reached me from the Uussian doctor, begging me not to wait dinner for the lieutenant-colonel, who was detained at Arginn owing to the non-receipt of a reply to his comniuni cation on my behalf. He did not mention his wounded British patient. I could only hope that he was no worse. ' Daylight was excluded, and our shutters were closed at an'X.] EPISODICAL. 501 early hour. We dined, as we had breakfasted, four at the small table, and on the principle of community acknowledged on the former occasion. Lut there was a visible improvement in the tare. The cutlets showed signs of culinary skill, and there was a cold confection of cream, tempting as a Nesselrode or an English ice-pudding. The Crimean wine of which we partook was palatable, and a by no means unpleasant change from indifferent sherry. It should be noted that, notwithstanding frequent libcitions ot tciki, or spirit, tea (without milk) is in very general request among the Kussians. In the present case, the usuaj spacious urn smoked on the side-table from morning till night, and was in constant requisition. We drank the refreshing beveiage in tumblers. It was too sweet to suit my taste ; but being in Rome one must do as the liomans. I used to drink it with my good friends the Chinese, without sugar or milk at all, during the campaign against the Celestial Empire. Xight faiily set in, and no lieutenant-colonel or prince appeared. Ihe worthy host seemed at a loss how to amuse us and while away our time. He had insisted on our unbuttoning our coats, and had made his Cossack pull off our boots. He had given us meat and drink and tobacco to the top of our bent, yet we continued to smoke our meerschaums or clays, and he his trupca, in silent expectation of an arrival. An idea seemed to strike him. Would we object to singing ? By no means. So the concert be^an. O A young sergeant was introduced, and sat down in a further corner of the room. The lieutenant took pains to inform us that he was of gentle blood, as though in explanation of his admitting the social companionship of a sous-officier. There was something very prepossessing in this man's appearance. Tall, handsome, and of commanding figure, there was a simple modesty in his demeanour which could not fail to carry its own recommendation to the stranger. This was especially remark able in the short account which he rendered of his own share in the late skirmish. The Tartar landlord was another of the audience. He was an old man with well-defined features, partaking little of theTLLEGEAJ'H AMD TRAVEL. [chap. Kalmuck or Mongol contour ; and his dress was of better material than usually worn by his fellow-countrymen at Kertch. ' Murad' was a constant butt for the lieutenant, who joked him on his wealth and his wife, how he buried one and shut up the other ; and Murad wisely returned good for evil by snuffing the candles and performing sundry ministering offices for the society at large. I was inclined to believe the wealth and wife both fictitious, but there seems to be truth in the story; and, from what I since heard, Murad has perhaps little reason to complain of his liussian masters after all. I had already ingratiated myself in the day-time with the old man, by reading to hii^ the lirst chapter (Fatiha) of an Arabic Koran, discovered upon u i-helf in his house. So remarkably clear was the type, and so well got up the whole volume, that I made a point of securing one from the same press, on my return to Kertch. It is a credit to the printing establishment of the distinguished city of Kazan, and might be imitated with advantage in Egypt and India. ' The singers were three in number, and favoured us with some pleasing national airs, much in the style of glees. One of the three was a mimic, and partly a ventriloquist, and amused the audience by his imitations of old women, children, and cats. We came gradually to a'health' song; that is, as each one oi the party drank, separately in the one glass, to his neighbour's health (using the words ' karasha sdarovia the singers broke out into a brief accompaniment in support of the toast. On seeing that this performance had been received with approba tion, the lieutenaift proposed, through the interpreter, that we should drink the health of her Majesty Queen Victoria. What loyal subject could refuse the invitation ? The proposal was met with enthusiasm, and while each raised the glass and drained its contents, the Cossack voices rose as before in melodious strain, to do the toast honour. ' It was growing late. Suddenly a noise was heard outside, and visitors were announced. I hastily buttoned up my uniform coat, and pulled on my boots. Scarcely had I done so when the door opened, and an officer, in a green-and-gold hussai uniform, appeared, in company with the lieutenant -colonelIX -] EPISODICAL. 5() 3 Cossacks. lie came up and addressed me in English. There were no objections to my proposed visit; but, alas! it would now be of no avail. The British officer had died, that very afternoon, of his wounds, and the Turkish prisoners had been removed. The latter had been indeed met with by my inform ant on his way from Kaffa to Arginn! This was a melancholy piece of intelligence; and any further delay on my part would now appear useless. But an inclination to avail myself of the permission accorded, to proceed as far as Arginn, got the better of all other considerations. It was so close at hand, and the visit there would render my mission so much the more complete. 1 should, at least, see my poor friend's body. I put the matter in this light to the Prince. He acquiesced without a moment's hesitation; and his carriage was ordered to be in readiness to receive us. Ihe ground was one vast sheet of snow, and the cold outside was intense. I jumped into the conveyance—a kind of single- bodied chariot, drawn by six horses, two and two abreast—and uas placed between the Prince and the lieutenant-colonel. We moved along at a brisk pace, and were not so much jolted as might have been expected. After having accomplished about a couple of miles, or more, of our journey, a white handkerchief was handed to me, with a request that I would bandage my eyes. This I did ; though, from the front leathers of the carriage being strapped down, 1 could see nothing, before this, save one or two faint snowy lines. Two miles more brought us to our destination. I descended from the carriage, led by the hand like a blind man. After proceeding one or two paces in what I imagined to he the entrance ot a house, I heard a voice chanting. This grew louder and more distinct as I advanced. When they told me to take off the bandage it was to realise just what I had pictured. I stood by the bedside of the dead young soldier, and the voice that I had heard was that of one chanting a re quiem. The chanter was a Cossack. He stood in the corner of a large, low room, an open book and a candle on a table before him. He was officiating, it was stated, in the temporary absence of the priest, who had probably retired to rest. The'If If TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

The saloon is comfortable, and a m- taurateur on board caters for the wants of the passengers. Meet a former travelling companion, a Russian officer, going to Tiflis vid Astrakhan and Petrovsk.

I see nothing to uai rant a comparison with the Rhine, which one or two ot nn fellow-travellers put forward. The dwellings are chiefly woo en cottages in long rows, or partly detached and scattered, with an occasional brick and mortar building. The churches or convents, with globular steeples or tower tops, each one surmounted by a cross, and coloured blue, or gilt, or silvered, are conspicuous and familiar objects.

Ihe hospitality and friendliness of Russians to strangers is remarkably shown in the manner in which my tellow-passengers by steamer ply me with good wine at dinner, and dunk my health and success in the Persian expedition. e are six at table, inclusive of a lady of agreeable address and mien. I would wish to join the general conversation, instead of confining myself to the French entr'actes, but my Slavonic is at fault. We have a grand leave-taking after dinner; for all but M. de P., the Eussian officer, and I, are to remain at Kazan, where the lady has a daughter at school. There is a delay here of several hours, so I join De P. in a droschky, and we drive up to the town, a distance ot about five miles from the landing- place. ' The Marquis de Custines was prevented by ill-health from prolonging his tour eastward to Kazan, and consoled himself by looking at drawings of the town shown to him by the Governor of Nijni Xovgorod. There is much truth in his remark : ' C'est toujours la in&amp;ne ville d'un bout de la Eussie I'autre : la caserne, les cathedrales en mani&amp;re de temples, rien n'y man- quait; je sentais que tout ce rabadiage d'architecture ne valait guere la peine d'allonger mon voyage de deux cents lieues.' But I certainly had thought otherwise of Kazan, judging that it exceptions to 'rabachage' be allowed, it should be in favour oi that town. I was somewhat disappointed in the solution of the question. Upon the whole, Kazan is a Russian-looking town, with little genuine Tartarism. It has its Kremlin, its wide, straight streets, up and down hill, bad pavement and so forth. The approach to it, by a river suburb and wretchedly made load, rather sets it off as a picture. We pass on our left a Pyramidical tomb, marking a burial-place of Russians killed some centuries back in a fight with the Tartars. There is a Tartar a nd Chinese look about some of the people, but the RussianTELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. element is gaining ground. Kazan has probably from 40,000 to 50,000 inhabitants. We strolled in its gardens, prettily arranged along a shabby and little watered canal, and went into one or two of its shops, which make a respectable outward show. Purchased a small box of tea for three roubles ; and drank tea, moreover, at a restaurant, where a long, covered table gave note of a table d'hdte; but the dirty yard, almost on a level with the window sills, was enough to destroy the appetite of the diner. Visited the printing office, a place of considerable attraction to me since buying a Koran printed there from a Tartar in the Crimea, shortly before close of the campaign in 1855-56. 1 Here 1 found the whole establishment Russian, though Tartar work men are employed in setting up the Arabic and Turkish types. What would have been said of the Honourable East India Com pany had they printed and sold the Koran to the money profit of the State ! The type is excellent, and the carefully punctuated volume would supply an infinite number of valuable reading lessons to the Arabic student: but what Propaganda would sanction the principle involved in the result? One Tartar publication was called the 4 Alti Permak ' or ' six fingers.' 11 July 11.—Our passengers from Kazan this morning included the renowned General T. and the Civil Governor of Simbirsk. The first is a little above the middle height, rather stout in build, of healthy brown complexion, with grey hair and moustache, probably under 50 years of age. The expression of face is good, not stern, and the features are somewhat irregular. His appearance is that of a thorough soldier, and his uniform is a part of himself. He addressed me in French, and we talked on various subjects, among others his visit to England last November. The great increase of traffic on the Volga during the last twenty years, which he pointed out to me, was quite borne out by the statement of Mr. M., a Director of the A olga Company, in one of whose steamers we were then moving. I had seen Mr. M. and his partner, Mr. G., at Nijni, and the latter had kindly given me letters for Astrakhan. Mr. M. 1 See page S02, ante.x -] TRAFFIC ON THE VOLGA. 509 is a fellow-passenger, and proceeds to Saratoff on a tour of in spection. He appears to be jnst the man for his position, speaks Russian, trench and German with fluency, and has full infor mation on all matters connected with his work. There are I believe, four English Directors in the Volga Company, and only one Lussian Director; but it is not the only company owning passenger steamers on the river. Its two principal rivals are the Samalot, and Caucas and Mercur. It was, however, the first in the field, and had two tugs afloat twenty years ago. One boat, the Czarina, had been brought out by Mr. M. from England. He had steamed in her to St. Petersburg, taken her to pieces for canal conveyance, and towed her to the Volga, where she was again put together. Our saloons are about 24 feet by 14, and have twelve berths in four divisions of three berths each. There is also an upper saloon, small, but airy. I have a private cabin, and next me is the ladies' saloon, or 'Dameskaya/ There is a second class; and on deck is the captain's cabin, ' Capitanskaya.' Our captain is a Courlander, or German Russian, and was taken prisoner by the English in a merchant ship during the late war. A year in London made him pro ficient in the language. They say there are 400 steamers on the river; that as much as 500,000 ' ponds' weight (nearly 8,000 tons) may be towed up in barges; and that the Volga Company's boats can tow two-fifths of that amount. From ocular demon stration at this season, I should not demur to these statistics. The governor of Simbirsk, Mr. R, is, I understand, of German extraction. Like many Russians, especially German Russians, lie is almost English in dress and manner. He leaves us at Simbirsk, a large town of about 23,000 inhabitants, on arrival in the evening. This place was nearly burnt down in August last. July 12.— Reach Samara before mid-day. This is a rising town, marking a point ot the Volga where the river, having run its extreme course eastward, and approached nearest to Orenburg, turns sharply to the west. Its government is quite of recent institution, having only been added to the nine divisions of astern Russia in 1860.

[chap. menced, by the progressive spirit of the age, intluencing Russia as other great countries of Europe, is that of a railway from Moscow to Saratoff. I learn that it is either finished, or nearly finished up to Riazan ; but that want of funds will stop it for a time at that place. 1 The Grande Socitte dcs Chemins de Fcr, whose are the Warsaw, and Moscow to Nijni lines, was to have undertaken the work, and the Odessa lines also ; but it has been supplanted. Rumour is rife of excessive demands on the part ot some railway contractors : yet rumour may be wrong, and there may be no foundation for supposing that in this case the various and con tinuously -proffered claims took at one time the shape of a needless luxury, such as 'gloves for coachmen.' My own impression is that a line from Moscow to Saratoff would be well chosen, as would also be one from Nijni to Simbirsk, or from Simbirsk to Sizran, independently of the river. A glance at the map explains at once the object of these connections. All the large Russian towns on the banks of the Volga seem built upon the same prin ciple. They have long, wide streets parallel with the river and quay, and other long, wide streets at right angles. Here and there is a market-place. A great many churches, with dome or tower, relieve the monotony of the low white houses. 1 here is either no pavement at all, or the irregular stones irregularly put together present a state of things worse than the plain earth itself. The next town of importance to Samara, on the left bank, is Sizran on the right bank of the river, which we reach in the evening. It is said to contain 19,000 inhabitants. At about 11 p.m ., or a little earlier, we were at Khwalin or Ivhwalinsk, also on the light bank, with a reputed population of some 12,500. Here a part} of us took a night stroll through the dreary sandy streets; hut notwithstanding the thirst for adventure which influenced one or two of my companions, we returned to our boat without an incident worthy of record. 1 Since the period of my visit, the said railway—at first prolonged from Riazan to Vormesch, as though in abandonment of the Moscow-S &lt;vrato project—has been completed. In 1874, the proposal is to extend the li' e from Saratoff to Termez on the- Oxns, Indiaward. Such is progress in Russia!R USSIA X GA STRONOM 11 July l.&gt;. Lieutenant-Colonel T., of the Engineers, is a cheery Russian officer, whose acquaintance I have made on board the Volga steamer. He served against us in the Crimean cam- paign, but is on that account none the less friendly and well disposed. Passed A olsk in the morning, and reach Saratoff about mid-day. The first is said to have some 23,500 inhabit ants, the second must boast at least 35,000. Here we stayed till ;&gt; p.m . ; spending most of our time on shore. Dined at the \ oxall, after an excursion to the gardens, three miles away, amid excessive heat and dust. The restaurant overlooked the Volga, and was close by the landing-place of the steamers. Our fare was varied, if not gastronomically harmonious. We had soup, fish, fowl, cutlets, raspberries and cream, and beer. The soups have hard names, but they are good, especially those with vegetables. I cannot share the general admiration for the smaller kind of sturgeon, called 'sterlet,' so celebrated on the Volga. The word ' borch' may be found useful in ordering a pleasant soup; and ' kwas' is a remarkably nice drink, not unlike cider, but professedly obtained from barley. I recom mend both monosyllables to the attention of young travellers in laissia. Close to where we sat, three ladies of vocal powers and evident local celebrity were singing to an orchestral accom paniment. One, a quiet, pensive-looking girl, spoke German to a young Courlander of our party, whose father, a respectable and well-known Lutheran pastor, was also passenger in the Czarina. Had he been present, I doubt whether he would have encouraged the conversation, which, however, was soon inter rupted. The old gentleman is doing tourist as well as engaged on a pastoral visit. I am told that this day (the 1st of June by Russian computation) is the hundredth anniversary of the foun dation of the German colony of Ekaterinestadt, which we passed this morning on the left bank of the Volga, and that these colonies of Catherine II. extend along the river from above the latter place to Sarepta, which we do not reach until late in the J lay ^o-morrow. They are said to furnish an agricultural popu- a tion to the Steppes, a tract commencing on the left bank of t ie Wga at Samara, touching the Caspian southward, andhouses.

Soon we are saluted with the cries and howls of dogs, which are pronounced significant of wolves in the neighbour hood. The hour and evident desolation are not favourable to prolonged ambulation. We stroll back to the boat, just as a second steamer arrives. It is from Astrakhan, and I have some talk with a Persian passenger on board. 11 July 14—Late hours at night cause late rising in the morning. Did not leave my cabin till the day had grown old and hot. Arrive at about 3.30 p.m ., at Czaritzin, a tolerably large town on the right bank, which Jonas Hanway puts down as 688 miles distant from Moscow. Young E. asked me to come on shore, and so I did, for we had proposed to ourselves an excursion to the spot where are exhibited the hat and walking- stick of Peter the Great. Not succeeding in finding a droschky, we took to a cart, covered over with a bit of felt or blanket, and evidently designed for the transport of goods. Just, however, as we were starting, my companion remembered that a train was to leave that same afternoon for Chirskaya, or that port of the Don to which the Czaritzin Eailway proceeds, and he and his father, the pastor, as also the engineer colonel, were to avail themselves of it. Consequently, it was important to certify the time at his disposal. He would make inquiries at the station close at hand. We jumped off, not out of our con usance, and entered the house. Here also was a restaurant. What was my surprise to find seated in the public room, at a table, discussing red wine, cigars, and something perhaps more substantial, some acquaintances whom 1 had met a few months before at Constantinople, and with whom I should have pro ceeded thence to Tiflis, but for Colonel Stewart's sad and fatal dlness. After a few words of cordial greeting, Lord C. H. and Mr. E. determined to join the search for the imperial hat and stick, and accompany us on the primitive vehicle we had en gaged. Oil we go, four on a cart, and rattle along at fair speed till our progress is arrested by a river, apparently an inlet of the Volga.

Fresh arrivals among the passengers had created excitement on board the steamer, but the life and excitement was not confined to mere humanity. Something on the velvet cushions of my own particular cabin had alarmed me yesterday before nightfall; and certain small insects which moved like the tiniest .of cockroaches had kept me sensitive to the possibility of disturbance. I shook out and beat the useless finery, and lay down. Notwithstanding this pieli- minary movement, the precaution proved utterly futile. Hie onslaught was indescribable. Such parts of the body as were not tightly encased fell easily before the enemy. Sleep was out of the question. It was as far away from reach as a clean English bedroom.

The heat became excessive; the wind ceased ; in came the gnat of the steppes. A gnat, indeed ! a sort of giant mosquito . Hie cabin M as alive with these savage insects, buzzing lustily for blood. Never shall I forget my introduction to this unforeseen and most undesirable acquaintance. About 6 a.m . I bethought me of a vigorous movement which, if successful, would procure me a short sleep. It was broad daylight, and we had started on our course. Such of the insects as had not taken the hint to leave, and there were many of these, were settled on the walls and in dark corners. I rose and attacked them as they reposed, smiting in all directions, and occasionally with evident success. After a long and vigorous pursuit, accom panied with much slaughter, I hoped to have achieved my object, and lay down. Shortly, the buzz was again audible; and this time the intruders seemed concentrated towards myself instead of scattering and colonizing as before. In fine, I could scarcely get one wink of sleep, and rose in anything but lively mood to wash and drink coffee. De P. came in and sat with me ; he also had suffered from the visitation, but had slept until the gnats had supplemented the more sluggish insects. Indeed, however hidden and impalpable the physical effects of the later operations, there was clear evidence of the damage done by the first assailants to the whole body of passengers. The second class had turned out on deck in hopeless misery. A Greek family furnished a notable illustration of the ravage committed. The paterfamilias of this group was, by the way, a strange old gentleman. According to his own admission, he was travelling with his wife, daughter, and female companion, from Vienna to Astrakhan in search of a son-in-law. I was not aware that such articles abounded on the northern steppes of the Caspian; but we live and learn. We are on shore at Astrakhan about •3.30 p.m . ; and I make my way to a hotel near the landing-place, late Bremsel's. ' July \§. —Awake this morning at Astrakhan, and experi ence a heat like one's old enemy in India.

Looking out of one of its lower windows is a female with a red kerchief over her head, perhaps observing me at my open casement. There is a huge signboard and inscription on the front side of her house, and a small piece overlaps on which I can read .lEFJE^h which I make out to be, in Koman letters, ' lebed,' a swan. On the house to the right is the con tinual IlPO^ArKA or intimation such as ' Here is sold.' The small upper domes on the church and tower are green, sur mounted with gold. In the little arches are paintings. The houses at Astrakhan have usually one story, and are of wood or brick, red, white and of other hues. The small unpretending quays on the outlet of the Volga are rather pretty, and the view of the wooden bridges across this small river is pleasant enough. Dined to-day with M. Victor de P., my fellow-traveller's brother, who is a merchant of Astrakhan ; and a sumptuous repast it was they gave me, inaugurated with caviare and shell fish, and crowned with ice in profusion. The amiable hostess could speak English, but general conversation was carried on in French. We were quite en famille, six in all, of whom two were ladies, Madame P. and her husband's sister; and a third lady joined us after dinner. Among other topics w r as discussed the literature of the day; and I was astonished to find not only Morier, whose Persian romance is equally adapted to the conti nental as English taste, but Dickens and Thackeray appreciated in Astrakhan. 'Vanity Fair' and' Pickwick ' are said to be capital in Russian ! As regards Russian original literature, 1 noted down rather the substance than the actual exposition of the views expressed. They do not consider themselves sufficiently advanced in social civilization to present a gallery of finished portraits to the satirist.

Whatever amount of roubles is realised by the local municipality—and money seems plentiful in Astrakhan— the body corporate is unable to spend more than eighty at a time (about £12), but the governor may authorize an outlay up to GOO. Great complaint is made of centralization as an obstacle to progress, and the wish is evident to develop local resources independently of St. Petersburg. 1 have remarked this on more than one occasion during my few days' experience in Russia, and in the language of apparently sensible and well- informed men. Called on the Persian consul this morning, and, at the time previously arranged, was ushered into a respect able apartment terminating in a smaller one with the usual chairs and sofa. Took a seat on the last, looking stately and serious, while a secretary in spectacles sat on the arm-chair at the further side. We had exchanged a few words in Persian, when the consul himself appeared. He was a mild, thin, middle- aged man, of polite manners and address, and we had a long talk. I am more sure of his figures than his currency; but he certainly represented the Persian imports to Astrakhan as four times the amount of Eussian exports to Persia. Cotton, he in formed me, was imported in large quantities both from Mazan- deran and Khurasan. He knew several British officers connected with his country, and spoke of them by name. His inner room Mas lmn g closely with portraits, amongst others her most gra cious Majesty ; and in the larger one was a prominent picture of the Emperor Alexander. There was also the Shah, as natural, and there were several officers in blue uniform whom I took to e Eussian. He wrote something diffuse in Eussian on my passport, affixing his seal, and promised to send me a letter for the icali, or governor of Eesht. Three or four whiffs at his Mian formed a necessary interlude in our proceedings. Dined &lt;l ,?ain to-day at the Eussian merchant's, resuming acquaintance8 1 If.'lj.

Strange that no postage stamps should he procurable at Astrakhan, a place of much the same compa rative commercial note in Russia as Leith or Hull, if not Glas gow or Liverpool, in our island home ; and it would be remarkable indeed were no stamps to be got in those flourishing ports. The double commerce of the Volga and Caspian is its portion. Its quays and wharves abound with traffic; its boats are assuredly to be reckoned by thousands; its inhabitants are mixed and various, and strictly commercial or working. Yet my host avers they cou^d not get me three stamps of 30 kopecks each ! Went last evening, and again this morning, to see the barge which is to convey us to the Caspian steamer ; but could not obtain a passage-ticket, as my passport had been given up and retained. Mr. 0., for whom—as well as the more celebrated Mr. S.— I had received letters from Mr. G., is an apothecary; and the whereabouts 'in which he dwells' having been discovered, 1 had referred to him on the subject of visds. He politely asked me to dinner and tea, and undertook to do the needful with my passport. Accepting the latter offer, I had left the paper with him, and he certainly kept it a tolerably long time. However, all went well at last. The dust of this place is a great nuisance, and its prevalence forced me to close to-day the windows of my apartment. It really is a good room of its kind ; 17 feet by 3, and about 18 feet high, with a well-boarded floor of good, polish-taking wood ; and it has two tine large windows. Furniture—sofa with dark glazed cover, the worse for wear; au reste, five chairs, and two small tables, of which one is very rickety and like an Indian tinpai, or 'teapoy.' There is a looking-glass, a suspended double lamp, and there are brass fixtures for a stove, and lights. At night I lie down on the sofa, or divan, putting my saddle under my head, filling up the hollow with a railway rug, and covering it with a towel for pre caution against insects.

Dine again with my Russian friends preparatory to taking final departure from Russia. 'July 19.—In truth these De P. s have been very attentive to me, and I have reason to remember gratefully their attention and hospitality. The sister's husband is in England. Another sister, whom T did not see, is married to a high functionary in the Caucasus. Our parting dinner yesterday was agreeable in its friendliness. I returned from it to the hotel, and got my baggage weighed and put into the barge bound for the Caspian. Another night on the sofa, and this morning early I came on board. Felix de P. my old travelling companion, and a young lady whom I had met at his brother's, had arrived before me, having made a midnight embarkation. Mademoiselle has just come down from St. Petersburg to take up the post of governess at Lenkoran, on the Caspian, in the family of the commandant. She has a pleasing manner, and leaves a lavourable impression. We start about 7 a.m ., in presence of assembled crowds, amid which the high Persian hat is very con spicuous. Indeed we have on board a great many Persians, who spread carpets and smoke kalians after the little-chamnno customs of their country. But all are not Persians; for fam addressed at breakfast, in French, by a portly dame in a dressing- gown, with a semi-Dutch and a semi -Jewish appearance whose whereabout and whatabout perplex me. I begin to think that queer characters of either sex abound as much on the water as on land. The Danube steamer is a case in point; and 1 am not sure that the Scheldt and Rhine boats might not be ^ rusted to supply further examples, together with the Volga arachod' and Astrakhan barge. Madame B.'s history savours 0 ie last, but contains enough romance and incident for a sensational novel. Mistress of a hotel, but not of herself and ancies, she wanders the world strangely, hovering near the seppes and the Caspian; a curiosity in her own particular M ay, but little known to those who have never visited these Parts.

AFanage to get ourselves and our luggage on board, amid much confusion and a certain amount of mismanagement. ' July 20.—By some strange process, inexplicable, but certainly undergone, we got settled last night in our sea-boat, leaving Chitteribugore, or the 'four hills,' at about 2 a.m . In the saloon were I)e P., a Teutonic Russian, and a Dutch tourist; perhaps one or two more. Talked much with our captain, who had accompanied us in the barge from Astrakhan—a tall, big-boned, German Euss, who speaks English well, and has an English name. His engineer is a thorough Englishman from Newcastle, whose acquaintance I am glad to make. At about 10 at night we reached Petrovsk, on the western shores of the Caspian, where De P. leaves us: during the day we had touched also at Chun- drakoffsky, or a place rejoicing in some such name. De P. is a companion whom I shall miss; nor am I the only one on board to regret his departure, though the captain and he are not on the best of terms. He committed to my charge the lady traveller, whose Caspian voyage wanted yet some days of comple tion. The Caucasus and Mercury Company have three passenger steamers, two English and one Swedish built. We are now in the last, the Grand Duke Michael, the others being the Prince Bariatinsky and the Archduke Constantine. They have also six trading steamers, exclusively perhaps of a smaller class of boat. The Russians have stations east as well as west of the Caspian, namely, at Tiouk Karagan and mouth of the Oural river north, and at Ashurada to the south-east. 1 A steamer runs troni Astrakhan to Tiouk once a month, thence proceeds north to the Oural, and returns to Tiouk and Astrakhan. This appears to be a commercial, if not postal arrangement. The harbour at Tiouk is said to be an admirable one, but the station is not popular, owing to the barrenness inland. It occurs to me that a position might be selected lower down, to correspond with the railway, when completed, from Poti to Baku, and carry on traffic still further eastward, and, vice versa, open out lor the markets 1 Those who have become interested in the Central Asia question, and fol lowed its mazes dnrin^ the last two years, will add more names to the list.x.] PIER AT PETR0V8K. 521 ot Europe the Lazars of Central Asia.

'July 21.—They are building a pier, or making a harbour at Petrovsk: 2 at all events, Government is not asleep, and attends to progress there as elsewhere. !rom this place we move out, with the irregular coast, seaward, and then in again and along the shores of Daghistan, until we stop at Derbent, a picturesque town on the slope of a hill, with a line of walls running down to the sea front. For passengers to whom moments are precious, there is much time lost in waiting so long at these ports. A run from Astrakhan to Enzeli might, otherwise, be accomplished in three or lour days. From Petrovsk there is a road of about 500 versts (332 miles), through the mountains, to Tiflis; but from Derbent, a nearer point as the crow flies, I understand that the journey would be difficult. Failing in a convenient opportunity, I do not land; 3 but the place is of considerable interest, not alone on account of its romantic position, but of associations which belong to the days of Alexander. I hear mention of 1 Krasnovodski, occupied by 3,000 Russians in 1869, would represent an occupation such as here contemplated four years before realization But however complacently the question be regarded in a geographical and cosmopolitan sense, the purely political aspect cannot be set aside. There is very much to be said and very much to be conjectured on these matters generally, as treated in recent Blue Books. And when this diaiy was written the spontaneous speculations of the press and the forced discussions of c ip omacy had not peopled the wastes immediately east of the Caspian with armies ot the future, nor raised up in the heart of their sterility both military depots and strategical points. Home-thrusts like the Oxus boundary question, and stubborn facts like the Khiva expedition, have a hothouse power in ripening theories about Central Asia ; nor is it a bad result of such con ingencies that the full-grown taxpayer of Great Britain should know Wnf 0 f )ll0 . nt:l1 actuall ty, to say nothing of mere orthography, than is to be arnt from the Aladdms and Sindbads of our boyhood. thp ..~? leted ; and 1 Can bear P ersonal testimony to its great use, and 3 skilful solidity of its construction. , dld 1 ^ h0WeVer ' 0n a subse( l uent 0 ^asion, having touched at Derbent again m 1870, 1871, and 1872. iVlip h . ^ telegraph and travel. [chap. ancient remains, which may be worth the inspection. Our messing on board the Michael is not bad, and every meal is charged at a fixed rate. I attend all upon principle, though appetite is not always to be commanded. Our captain tells wonderful stories of Turkmans, one of which is to the effect, that a brother skipper on the Caspian was in chase of a Turk man craft guilty of piracy, failed in an attempt to destroy her with cannon shot, but succeeded in running into her, breaking her in half, and thus sinking the wreck and whole crew ! With the exception of six Russians employed in the engine-room, the captain, first officer, engineer and saloon servants, I understand that the crew of the Michael are Tartars. They are preferred to Russian sailors, owing to the imbibing propensities of the latter. Many Persians are among the deck passengers, and miserable enough they look in the midst of their bundles on deck. They are not, as a rule, allowed access to the poop, nor should I sup pose they were treated with more consideration than are native passengers in a British boat on the Indian seas. Though inform ation of all sorts is procurable on board, I cannot admit that a sea passage on the Caspian has intellectual charms or much mental profit, especially with uneasy waters such as these. ' July 22.—Reach Baku in the afternoon, passing island with gas factory, and lighthouse on the main land. Baku is an old Tartar town, and shows signs of former note and consideration. It is now being moulded into fashion suitable to the present age .. ■ an d the progressive ideas of its present masters, and promises further improvement. Built on the slope of a hill, and partly inclosed by a wall similar to that of Derbent and other Cau casian towns, its houses are of mud, brick and stone, and there are but few trees to relieve the monotony of Asiatic dust. There is something very familiar to me in the contemplation of its long lines of bazar, which strike me as mere reproduction of a common Oriental picture. The shopkeepers are mostly Cau casian, Tartar and Persian; the true Russian being scarce among them. With the Persians I felt at home, and could get on famously: with the Others I could manage to attain intelligi bility by the use of Osmanli Turkish. Mademoiselle E., th' 1X.] BAKU. 623 Dutch chevalier and friend, and I, soon find our way to the shore, and pioceed to examine the place ; commencing with a few small purchases, such as fruit, cigarettes and a hat turband, ami continuing w ith the more luxurious pcisseteTYijps of a drive. Hie lady and I occupy one droschky, and our companions another, and the respective coachmen obey instructions to show us the town and its lions. The hired vehicles of Baku are driven by Tartars at a smart pace, and are not bad of their kind, notwithstanding a shakiness and brittle exterior. Observed a handsome Armenian church under construction, and many stone houses rising near the water; but the quays, which are so sus ceptible of development, are comparatively neglected. Probably the municipality is fettered here as at Astrakhan, and probably such results as malversation and maladministration of funds when realised, may not be unknown at Baku. The prominent building in Baku, towards the sea and lighthouse, is called ' The Maidens lower,' and it has a local legend somewhat of a Cenci character. Ihe story goes that a Tartar princess was proposed lor in marriage by her own father, and that she naturally declined the offer: that he became fierce and pressing, and she ostensibly submissive and yielding : that she made her consent conditional on Ins building her a tower, the tower, par excellence, of Baku ; that he agreed to the terms laid down, made over to her the completed building, and that her first act on obtaining possession was to tlirow herself from its highest point and perish ! I had no notion that Baku had ever boasted a Beatrice; but I cannot say that the legend has altogether convinced me of the fact. There are several baths here, notably those of the club, arsenal and custom-house; admission to which may be procured by visitors with friends, interest, or a little coin of the realm. Return to steamer, all the better for our trip and relief from cabin hie, and with the resolution to make exploration of the vol canoes and volcanic fires which have given such celebrity to this Port. Many visitors to our captain to-day, a circumstance U llc 1 seem s to corroborate his own claims to notoriety. Did »ot see the caravanserai, but there is, it is believed, a good one the 'se of stray travellers.' July 23.—Went in the evening to look at the wonderful tires, distant about twenty-one miles from the town in an easterly direction ; for at Baku a wide tongue of land projects to seaward considerably in advance of the general line of coast west of the Caspian. Amid the fires is a large factory, and thither Mr. H. our English engineer, who acted as guide to Mademoiselle E. and myself, directed the coachman to drive. On arrival we saw the German assistant superintendent and his family, who received us with civility and hospitality combined, thanks, doubtless, to the presence of a mutual acquaintance, in the per son of an introducer. To say that these fires are curious, or worth seeing, is to say nothing. They are marvellous, and worthy of classification among natural wonders. There is a large tract of ground near the sea, on the peninsula of Absharan, 1 out of which gas issues in profusion. The whole soil appears to be impregnated here with naphtha, and the application ot fire to the vaporous region will cause a flame to arise, extinguish- able only by water or smothering. Many flames are aroused and kept alive, for use in various ways. In the kitchen of our host, for instance, they played a conspicuous part, cooked his meat, boiled his water, warmed such things as had need of warming, and served to economise domestic labour. The aspect of the fires at night gives the notion of a watchful camp. Many are built upon; that is, the fire is carried through a conductor raised upon it. Each of the two stone pillars at the factory gate is thus surmounted with a high, bright flame. A photo graph would convey no notion of these phenomena, and to ic- present them with any approach to truth or correctness would tax the powers of a consummate artist. Attached to, and per haps a little higher than, the large factory wall inclosing the several buildings of the establishment, is an inclosure of a cas tellated kind. It has a rampart, and on the rampart is a lift e house like that above the gateway of an Oriental fort. Beside this house the steps lead down to the lower court, a space o about ten yards square, in the centre of which is a Hindu temple. I take the etymology which looks the most likely.x. HINDU PILGRIMS. Near the toot of these steps is shown a large dark stain, marking the spot where the last Hindu fakir perished, the last who had made a pilgrimage to Baku. T am told that there have been as many as forty at a time here; and, to judge from the numerous rooms or cells, this might well have been the case. I entered one cell, that of the last hermit, and about it was the unmis takable architecture of the Indian domicile; the earthen threshold, and cooking-place, and seat: a broken ewer of earthenware made the recollection even more vivid. And why hindu pilgrim. was this wretched man murdered? All that the factory people knew on the subject was that there were two Hindus there. One went back with intent to return to his own country, and the other remained, already then a resident of many years. One day the family of the factory went to Baku, leaving the fakir, as they supposed, well and safe. On their return, he was found murdered, and his idols and little property had been stolen. Suspicion fell on the Tartars, but I have not heard that any Tartar was tried or questioned on the matter. The papers■ TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

A river steamer came in with damaged engines this morning. Up early in search of a bath, obtaining one with little difficulty in the customs department. Although they are reported to be private, a tall Caucasian official, who speaks Persian, admits me as a special favour, in consideration of a small douceur. I am inclined to the belief that he has authority and instructions to admit strangers to the privilege. At all events two Russ bathers came out when I was holding a position before the door, and said nothing. The Dutch chevalier and his com panion are seriously purposing a start inland to-day. They have hired an Italian servant, and he is to get them a carriage; so that Baku is not without its civilized resources. The said servant may do very well, notwithstanding that he has been picked up at random. In fact, all Italians from Suez to Con stantinople, and from Constantinople to Baku, generally-ex- pressed lines which include considerable circuits, seem to me picked up in this way, and some prove very good acquisitions. They go through strange adventures; and their histories, it recorded in detail, would possess many startling and sensational incidents. I had a Francesco in the Crimea, an invaluable scamp, whose roguish tricks have not effaced the memory of his good services. This Baku Italian has amusing acquaintances one of whom I chance to meet; he is the keeper of the Hotel d'Italic, a shabby kind of restaurant. Mine host, a Piedmontese, with rings in his ears, was formerly joint owner of eihgteen dogs and monkeys. The monkeys had arrived at Astrakhan en route to Tiflis, via Baku, when by some sad accident, of flood or field, they all perished. The travelling establishment, whicn had acquired a high repute, was brought to an untimely end; 1 Life of Jonas Hanway, 1788.X.] FT RES OF BAKU. 527 and the entrepreneur had to make his own way on as well as he could. He found himself at Baku, and started a restaurant there. I have not ascertained what became of the dogs, but some might deem too close an inquiry, under the circumstances, undesirable. The Hotel d'ltalie is said to be very indifferent; but what can one expect at such a place, if comparisons be allowed ? A second steamer comes in this afternoon, almost exactly resembling that of the morning. She is from Astrakhan; whereas the other was working up from the opposite direction, and broke down, as I learn, near Lenkoran. Another drive to day through the town and environs. The same sights present themselves as before; there are the same monotonous lines of Tartar, and Circassian, and Persian caps and faces—the same monotonous forms of male bathers. We were to have gone to-day to see the wonders of naphtha exhibited in the water as on land, for there are marine gas fountains on the sea side of Baku, said to be worthy the traveller's notice ; but the weather was un favourable, and our design abandoned. I am told that the gas rises in a disturbed circle of about fourteen inches diameter, and may be set on fire in the midst of the salt sea waters. Many of these circles are formed at short distances one from the other.' The fires of Baku have attracted so much attention from Caspian and Caucasian travellers, and are really so well worthy of more general discussion and intimate acquaintance by the scientific world, that 1 here venture to make a short pause, and add a few fresh words on the subject. It seems to me that although very much may have been written about these ignitible vapours, whether in a scientific or whether in a historical point of view, very much more remains to be recorded. The two newest accounts now before me are by foreign explorers, lliere may be others of later date by Englishmen, which I have overlooked or of whiphlknow, nothing ; but 4,10 'th or Mr. MounseyVlS-H^ SirArthur Cunynghame fi*t include unv ouoh noticoa iu tlu.Mr (/uuf.'iujian tt'twulo.

Moynet, a fellow-traveller with Alexandre Dumas, narratives of which were published in 1865 and 1863 respectively. Both, concisely related, are interesting : and M. Moynet supplements his literary matter, or vice versd, with accurate drawings of Astrakhan, Derbent, Baku, and the Fire Temple, In detailed description, however, both fall short of M. Gmelin's report, for which we are in debted to the last century. 1 M. de Filippi gives the yield of the naphtha wells in the Absharan peninsula at a mean of 300,000 puds yearly, or nearly 4,700 tons English. He states that there are several kinds, of which the most remarkable are the solid and pitchy, found at Ohelekan Island in the south-east corner of the Caspian, exported to Russia, Persia, and Bokhara, for much the same uses as asphalte in France and Italy ; and the viscous and liquid, like the petroleum of Baku. The product is, in his estima tion, inseparable from the inflammable gas with which the whole soil is more or less impregnated. Whether the combination is natural, fortuitous, or caused by volcanic agency, be leaves to further inquiry. Professor Stoppani of Milan, and Signor Abich, are those to whose theories he refers in elucidation of these singular phenomena : but he is not prepared to subscribe fully to their conclusions. 1 ' Histoire des Decouvertes faites par divers Savans Voyageurs,' &amp;c. Tome ii. Lausanne, 1784. 4 ' Mi pare die la cosa non sia per anco sufficientemente dimostrata, se &gt;- bene i fatti addotti dal Prof. Stoppani siano di molto peso, e ricevano lap- poggio dell' incontestabile autorita del Sig.

(' Viaggio in Persia.' Milano, G. Daelli e Cia.,-18^' Note p. 329.)IDOL WORSHIP AND FIRE WORSHIP. 529 As regards the marine gas, lie writes: ' About an hour's distance south of the city, near the shelving banks of the shore, there are strong gaseous fountains, gurgling, and throwing out a certain amount of petroleum, which spreads itself, in the finest of veils, on the surface of the water. The contact of a lighted torch causes to be aroused from within whirlwinds of fire . . , and my comrades revelled in steering their boat amidst them, guided by the powerful arm of Captain Muller, the hairs of whose head and beard were exposed to the scattered Hames.' M, Moynet's account is fuller still. He is in a boat with others. A sailor throws lighted tow into the sea, where the waters appear fermented. In an instant the whole surface is in flames to the extent of some forty metres (forty-five yards). The experiment is repeated ; the fire spreads; and they move about in the midst. On leaving the spot our author looks back upon the still bright flames, remarking that they will continue to burn until put out by a high wind, ' which may, perhaps, not come for a fortnight or even a month.' 1 It is by no means improbable that the natural wonders of Baku were known to Zoroastrians before the Muham- madan era; moreover, that the same importance was attached to them by the fire-worshippers of old. But it is a very great mistake to make the modern Hindu pilgrim to the west shores of the Caspian a Parsi, or a descendant of Parsis. He has really no affinity with the Bombay millionnaire and his sect, as inferred by M. Moynet. The Italian professor seems also to have fallen mto a like error when he calls the ofliciating Hindu ' un 1 ' D'Astrakhan a Bakou,' Octobre 185S. See ' Le Tour du Mondo/' 1^(53.

The term ' Gabr' could now hardly apply to any than the Parsi, according to Oriental usage and parlance ; and he leads us to infer that his pilgrim is of this class. ' July 25.—Start at about 3 a.m . The night had been fine, but heavy rain preceded actual weighing of the anchor. Eeach Salian at 10.30 a.m ., and take in a solitary letter sent out from shore by boat. Land here very low : a strip of green grass is just discernible, but there are half-a-dozen small craft to mark the place. Pass the mouth of the Kur, where the water is shallow and there is a reputed resort of flamingoes. We are at Lenkoran about 3.30 a.m. This is a small Russian station near the sea-shore, much wooded but otherwise not remarkable. See another steamer at anchor near us, one of the commercial class, not intended for passengers. Her English engineer, brother of our own of the Michael, pays us a visit. The two give me the impression of being worthy members of a steady, honest family, right well and honourably disposed. The governess takes leave and goes to the shore, in company with her new mistress, who had come to fetch her in a large boat. I augur nothing from appearances, for appearances may be as deceitful on the Caspian as elsewhere : but I sincerely hope that her lot has fallen in a pleasant place. Madame is a dark-complexioned, plain personage, of middle age, clearly self-reliant in matters ot dress and outward bearing. She is apparently much wearied and put out by the effort of boating and boarding the steamer, begs for water, indulges in conventional byplay, sits down languidly, calls for and operates upon a long brown paper cigarette, asks questions, and makes references. Her attendants consist of a stout, wild-looking man of martial aspect, with hair floating wildly from under his forage cap, military dark coat, and white trousers, possessing, withal, a smiling and facetious manner and address : a second stout person in white military uniform, look ing very sleek and pleasant; and a shabby, common soldier orderly, who answers readily, but loudly and familiarly, to all his mistress' requisitions. Poor Mademoiselle ! You look haltX.J ISLAND OF SARI. 531 afraid ot your new career ; and there is no wonder. The posi tion is on few occasions void of painful anticipations; and there is a kind of severe isolation in these parts which needs counter action from extra human kindness. The captain pointed out to me to-day, on his map, the course of the high hills visible near Lenkoran, It appears that the valley of the Kur is flat and extensive. From a little below Baku to near Lenkoran the country bordering on the sea is mountainless ; but in the neigh bourhood of the last-named port, the mountains of the Talysa mix with those of the Kara L)agh, and the long lofty line is formed which belts in the provinces of Ghilan and Mazanderan, and only fails towards Khurasan and the east. Weigh anchor ior the island of Sari, and get on shore there before dark. Join the captain, engineer and a third, in quest of pheasants, and ac companied by dogs. Find little, however, but mosquitoes, and are caught in heavy rain. Eeturn wet to supper. 'July 26.—A thunderstorm last night is succeeded to-day by very heavy rain and bad weather. The captain and engineer take advantage of a break to go again to the island on a shooting excursion. By the way, a sad story is told in connection with Sari, and the circumstance narrated is said to have happened only about six weeks ago. An old man, Persian or Tartar, had been left in charge of the wood there. He, a son, and two daughters, were the sole inhabitants, the girls being young, of some fourteen years and twelve respectively. Not long ago he thought it incumbent on him to undertake a pilgrimage, and set ting lorth left his children at Sari. During his absence certain ruffians took advantage of the occasion to land and murder the young occupants of the island, after outraging the girls. Sus picion fell on a boat's crew now under trial; but it appears doubtful whether justice will ever overtake the miscreants in the ordinary course. The island is about ten miles in length by onlv 1 or 1| mile broad, is covered with grass and brushwood, has good well-water, and could afford excellent pasture for cattle. In consideration of the comparative vicinity of Baku, and its likelihood of becoming a place of great local, if not general im- portance, I think that Sari might be turned to good account. M M 2At Baku there is no grazing for flocks and herds, and though good grapes grow there, I do not think it has much fruit or vegetables of its own. The vine is far from being a stranger in volcanic soil; and certainly the Caucasian wines are not to be despised. We had to-day some white 'Derbent,' a drink not unlike Sauterne; and the red Derbent is already an old and ap proved acquaintance. The captain and engineer return to the steamer at about 1 p.m . drenched with rain, and with no larger trophy than three pheasants. There may be some truth in the charge brought by the former against his dog, that he is too fat and well-fed from a ship life to do his duty in the field. Weigh anchor again, and steam to Astara, touching first at Lenkoran again for letters. This latter place has a feverish look. 1 A small sturdy tower is pointed out as its fortification, and near it the Lenkoran river runs into the sea. Astara marks the Persian frontier on the seaboard. It is a small place situated in the wooded belt of low land at foot of the mountains, and be tween them and the Caspian. One of our fellow-passengers, the superintendent of customs, landed here. If carrying a gnu gives claim to the title, he must be a sportsman. ' July 27.—Sight Enzeli soon after breakfast, and I make pre parations accordingly. This repetition of matter-of-fact incidents, such as packing luggage and paying bills, is a disagreeable feature in travelling. It is so necessary and yet so harassing. Make the best of my way to the shore, and present myself to the Russian Consul, Mr. P., a short, busy man, somewhat past middle age. Nothing can be more gracious and hospitable than his reception. He places at my disposal the traveller's room in bis house, an apartment about 14 feet by 6, with pictures of flowers and females. A decolletee beauty on the ceiling is rouged up to the eyes, and surrounded with miniatures of attendants in all kinds of impossible positions and attitudes, to say nothing oi the flying charmers supporting her. The niches in the wall remind me of Baghdad, and I now feel in Asia in earnest—a sensation of sorrow mingled with hope. It is sad to have to complain of hospitality; but it is of its signs and effects in certain places, 1 It has, I believe, been abandoned as a station, by Imperial decree.*■] HALT AT RESHT. 533 not of the virtue itself that complaint is made. Oh, Mr. P., kind Mr. P., why did you put rum in my tea ? why make me drink absinthe? why insist on my pouring down my throat wine for breakfast ? and why call on me to take a parting glass, when my head was aching and my spirits could derive no strength from such vulgar stimulants ? Yet all was meant in kindness, and your little friend, the dragoman of the Eussian legation at Tehran, played his part right well in the conversation. Finally the Consul gave me his ghulam 1 and letters of introduction, and off I started under most favourable auspices. But the sun was hot, and the sight of Persian boatmen recalled past years which I cared not to revert to ; and the head was very painful and heart somewhat sick ; and I had four long hours to accomplish in working up the Enzeli lake and quasi-river. The acacia and other trees were very pretty in the narrow water passage; and the boatmen were not so coarse and savage as many I have known. But my energies failed me to profit from the passing hour, and 1 dozed and dreamt disquietedly. After a wearisome water journey we reached the Pir's halting-place, from which one farsakh, or less than four miles, remains to Resht. Horses were prepared, and we mounted. Three only were put in requisition : one for myself, one for the ghulam, one for the baggage : and what a road! it was a continual rut or puddle. My portmanteaux were bespattered in merciless style, and looked as if they would come down at any moment. On the way, the Jilwadar, or attendant groom, dismounted, then remounted the heavily-laden beast, per forming the second part of the feat with a dexterity savouring of the circus. At length we reached llesht, first going, under the ghulam's guidance, to the Russian Consul's, but afterwards tairly bringing to at the most hospitable house of Messrs. V. and M., of the well-known firm of Ralli and Co. Here I was pro vided with a comfortable bed and bedroom, and felt myself quite well off again. I had not only a bed, but sheets, and could actually undress : had it not been for sand-flies and mosquitoes, I should have slept splendidly.

However there is much to do in the way of preparing for a journey, and we set about arrangements this morning in earnest. Get out new saddle and have it put in order, presenting the extra bit and bridle to M. Buy saddle-bags, felt and necessaries, and out with revolver. Initiate myself, moreover, into the current coin of the country, obtain 50 Persian tomans—in short do much useful work with intent to leave to-morrow morning. Look at some beautiful Resht embroidery, which is very tempting. Messrs. Ralli and Co. are building a very snug house for their representatives here, and in supersession of their present quarters, which are by no means bad. Resht is the chief town of Ghilan and the S.W. of the Caspian, corresponding, as it were, to Asterabad on the S.L. It is a quiet sort of place, but, as the emporium of the silk of the province, it has become the residence of English, French and Lussian Consuls or \ ice-consuls, and of European merchants more or less in number. I hear that the Russian Consul has a hundred Russian subjects to look after at Enzeli alone. Some it not all of these are probably Armenians, said to be the great exporters of cotton from Persia to Russia. Resht is a thoroughly Persian town, with dirty and close streets, the houses of Europeans being its only decent buildings. Report current of a revolt at 1 iflis, checked, however, by prompt and vigorous government action Obnoxious taxes are the commonly-reported cause, and Armenians are supposed to be implicated. How graceful and elegant is the Persian ' Abreshm or silk tree, with its fine indented leaf, and pale, delicately-scenting flower! To under stand Persian paintings, it is essential to see Persian gardens and vegetation. The soil here is rich and fertile. Met the trench Consul, a genial, merry man, and good.Eastern scholar. Bedroom walls present appearances which lead me to call in aid. Perhaps it was the determined assault made upon the reposing sand-flies which enabled me to pass a tolerably satisfactory night. 'July 29.—My first day's 'chaparing.' Chapar is a word which becomes so familiar to the ear after a short residence inX.] REMIT TO MANJJL. 535 these parts, that an explanation of its meaning seems to be an almost incomprehensible exigency to those who are not out-' siders in Persian experiences. In plain English it means riding post; and the chapar horses are horses engaged or kept np especially for postal service, consequently only to be found on certain roads where are regular postal stations. There is a chapar from Resht to Tehran, the first stage of which is Kadum, the second Rustamabad, and the third Manjil, which three, making a rough total of 60 miles, sufficed for my first day's journey. We started, probably after 5 a.m ., as we were delayed by the non-arrival of our horses. I had my own especial animal, and the ghulam his; while two more horses, one of which was mounted by the ' shagird chapar,' or attendant groom, carried the baggage. All my traps accompanied me, and my kind hosts had had the portmanteaux carefully strapped and covered with many layers of protective stuff. The country was, for the first 15 or 20 miles, through thick forest, along a good road, almost entirely shaded from the sun by the many and various trees on either side, none growing to any great height, but affording admirable shelter. It was that kind of country which brings to the habitue, of the Indian jungle a vivid recollection of spots where jungle fowl start up and cross the path at every step ; such as I have seen near Berhampore, in the Northern Circars, only more European. The sky here is not so thoroughly Asiatic as in India, and something around savours of home and English lanes and byways. We reached the first ' chaparkhana,' or post-house, sooner than I expected and indulged in tea and cold water ; perhaps more, but I forget. It strikes me we had the eggs and ' churek,' or country bread, at Rustamabad. Between this last station and Manjil, we left the woods, and got among the hot hills, crossing a bridge over the^'Safid Rud,' or 'white river,' a mile or two before the post- house. Our route had been for some time along the left bank of the river, which has much the character of a large mountain torrent. I was tired on reaching the third chcqmrhhuna, but had not much of an appetite. Got through some broth, and laid down to rest on anything but the most comfortable of beds. ■ f.TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. The (/hii/aui is attentive ami useful, and the people at the post- liouse are as civil as may be expected. Musquitoes, lleas, or some strange stinging insects make me shift my position. The sound of drawing the kalians is continual outside the room, and though sufficiently hushed and monotonous to induce sleep, is not actually provocative of that often -sighed-for result. Night comparatively cool, quite as much so as I could have expected at this season and in such latitudes. ' July 30.—Manjil to Kazvin: two long, weary, dreary stages of about fifty miles or more; first to Kharzan, which place it seemed as if we were never to reach, and then a still heavier stage to Kazvin. There was no mistake to-day about the heat. We had left the shaded lowlands of Ghilan, and passed into the bare mountainous country dividing them from Azarbaijan and the Kazvin district; and we had now descended into the plains at the south side of the Elburz. To me there is little attractive in the views of to-day : I have seen so much of the same kind, enough to be surfeited. Mountain scenery is always, in some way, pleasant in itself; but the view, from high ground, of distant, hot, wide-spreading plains, with black streaks indicating cities or gardens, is the contrary. Kazvin lies before us, a dark mark, long, long before we near it, nor does it invite the ap proaching traveller from Europe with anything genial or syvi- pathique. It has certain associations, this city; but they are too local to bear much general interest. I was thoroughly tired when I reached the post-house, and soon resolved to go no further for the day. Walked over to the telegraph office, which I found situated in what resembled the square of a mosque; the head officials discussing kalians outside, while seated on the stones. An Armenian came up to me, and as he was evidently anxious to shake hands, I accommodated him. He addressed me in good French. He was specially employed to teach the use of the Morse instrument. Sent a telegram in Persian to Captain S., at Tehran. Coming into Kazvin to day, I was an involuntary witness to the painful administration of a punishment called the 'felek. 1 It is a bastinado confined to the soles of the feet, which are inverted for the purpose.x.] KAZVin TO MIAN-JU. 537 But it lias been described over and over again bv competent pens.

So much depends on the kind of cattle one gets in these chaparings, whether the journey is tedious or easy.

But for the most part the country is dreary and desolate. There is but little vegeta tion, and all has a dried-up appearance. A bunch of grapes pre sented from time to time, is to the travelling horseman about the most cheery product of the soil. The post-house at Mian-ju is a rude sort of building on the approved principle. An orthodox chaparkhdna is composed of a square court, three sides of which are stables; the fourth side being the Iront, with a central gate and room to right and left. Above the gate is an upper room, which with a lower side room, is usually at the choice of the traveller. You may sleep on the roof of the stables, if you do not mind risking a fall into the court-yard—upon a horse, possibly, or mule picketed outside; or on thereof of your lawful room near the gateway, according to the time of year and state of the thermometer. On reaching Mian-ju, I found the travellers room occupied, so remained outside. Not being able to get even bread to eat, I opened a tin labelled ' fried solo, winch had picked up at St. Petersburg, and attacked it. Some small boys watched intently the operation ; but I did not long gratify their curiosity. It was dry fare and wanted relief, which I coul.l not procure. Contenting myself with consuming half the shreds of the fish (for such they really were), 1 gave the balance to the nhulam, who did not, however, show signs of rapture at the meal in prospect. The occupant of the upper room was an Italian lady, widow of a telegraph employt of Tehran. Her little daughter was a pretty child, and peered at me from t e upper story.

Tehran, the modern capital of Persia, though not of recent origin, cannot be said to have been a place ot much repute before Agha Muhammad, the first of the Kajar kings, made it his royal residence in about 1788. At this period, a little known but intelligent English tra veller, Ensiim Franklin, arrived at Bushahr from India and o 7 moved into the interior. It is unfortunate that oppor tunity was not afforded him to prosecute his journey, for he does not appear to have gone much further north than Shiraz, between the neighbourhood of which city and the sea his personal experience of the counti) DKMAVKND.XI -J TEHRAN. 541 was limited. Even the names of Jonas Hanway, an,I Jolm Bell, of Antermony, scarcely suffice to make the eighteenth other than a barren century in enlightening Europe on Persia, compared to the seventeenth ana nineteenth. The great want of Tehran is a river, the feature of all others in the landscape which should be indispensable to the site of a capital. Otherwise it is perhaps little more open to objection than Ispahan or Kum, which possess, at least, something of the kind. But after all, Shiraz the lauded, Tabriz, Kashan, Yezd, Mashhad, and Karman, are much in the same case; all built on river less plains and all at the foot or in a basin of hills and mostly having pleasant 'yalaks,' or summer resorts' easy of access, which are preferred by the higher orders to the towns themselves during the prevalence of the not season. My notes of Tehran in 18C5 made it a kind of six- doored polygon, having two gates to the north called JJaolat and Shamiran, two to the south, called Shah Abdul Azim and Nao, the Dulab or ea^t gate, and the azviii, or west gate.

The bazar is good of its kind, and has its architectural merits ; the caravanserais also deserve honourable men tion, and the telegraph and arsenal might pass muster as Oriental institutions. There are, moreover, a few respectable houses, occupied by European legations, or Persians of distinction ; but the palace and its adorn ments are not such as the Shah-in-Sbah can be very proud of after his visit to Europe and acquaintance with the abodes of European monarchs. Morier supposes Tehran to be the Tahors of the Theodosian tables, and recognizes it in its integrity of nomenclature in the four teenth century, when reading about the journey of the Castilian ambassadors to Taimur. Pietro della Valle visited it in the seventeenth century : also an English traveller. Sir Thomas Herbert, who spells it ' Tyroan. As the latter interprets Ispahan by ' Spawhawn, and ' Larijan ' by ' Larry john,' the actual orthography used to represent sounds is not so material as the sound itself, and in this respect we need not cavil even at a superfluous letter. It is by the same quaint writer not incorrectly described to be ' situate in the midst of a faire large Plaine, which although invironed in some parts with Hils of stupendious height, yet some ways affoords an ample Horizon.' But there is evidence that it was a royal resort, if not an actual residence, in Herbert's statement that ' the Tonne is most beautified by a vast o-arden of the kings, succinct with a great towred mud- wall larger than the circuit of the Citie.' He reckons it has 3,000 dwelling houses, ' in few of which are fewer than a dozen people,' an estimate which would certainlyXI.] TEH HAN. 543 give 30,000 inhabitants. Tehran may now possess 100,000. Had there been no famine or consequent sickness of late, the figures might have been rated certainly a fifth higher. Since riding into Tehran on the 1st August, 186'5, it has been my lot to revisit the place no less than four times—that is, in 1867, 1870, 1871, and 1872; and my residence there, within or without the walls, is nearly that of a twelvemonth. While speaking then of a first acquaintance, more than four months in duration, I naturally take advantage of experience obtained in subsequent sojourns. Mr. Alison gave me a courteous and hospitable reception : invited me to be his guest during my stay, and placed a saddle-horse and two mounted ' ghulams,' or special servants, at my disposal. Escorts in Persia, much as peons in India, cannot well be avoided by those who have positions to keep up in the regard of the outer world. Whatever personal inclination one may acknowledge, the flattering infliction is compulsory. My own tastes bid me thoroughly subscribe to the sentiment so well expressed by our keenest of modern humourists : ' If I were a duchess of the present day, I would say to the duke, my noble husband, ' My dearest grace, I think when I travel alone in my chariot from Hammersmith to London, I will not care for the outriders/ But her Majesty's Minister at the Court of Persia could not say as much to his secretary or steward when preparing for his drive in the suburbs of Tehran.

The spot to which British residents repair at these times is the village of Gulahak, distant about seven miles from the city, whence it is reached by a really good road, the greater part of . which, as it leads to royal summer quarters, was con structed by royal command. On this road, to the right of the traveller proceeding from Tehran, is the ' Kasr-i- K'lJ'U, 01 palace of the Kajar, a building now seldom occupied by the Shah himself, and attracting attention rather from its imposing site and grounds than any architectural beauty. I have heard that some Persians have compared it with the palace and gardens at Ver sailles. With all respect for its favourable position, 1 cannot see the force of the comparison. It has, however, been fully described by Morier and more recent writers. About the middle of October the legations move into the city again, greatly to the joy of the native establish ments, who begin to look cold and unsettled when the hrst and warmer month of autumn has passed away. So was it in 186.3. The British mission was then by the Nao gate, or between the Nao and Shah Abdul Azim. The Russian was in the Ark,' or citadel, near the Daolat. Ihe French was by the Kazvin gate ; and the Turks were located in the heart of the town. A change has come over this state of things ; and better provision has been made, •'t least for Lngland and Russia, the representatives of which powers boast highly respectable abodes in the i ersian capital. The British flag now marks a handsome an( l commodious building, or set of buildings, outside the old wall and a little within the projected barriers, rendered by the taste and skill of the architect worthy the residence of the envoy and staff of Persia's truest friend among the states of Europe.

The new Russian legation has been con structed near the Shamiran gate within the old walls, and is a comparatively massive building, without much attempt at novelty of design. While expressing approval at the new diplomatic residences, however, we should not fail to mention that for Tehran, a purely Oriental city, isolated by custom and distance from the favoured cities of western civilisation, the old and abandoned abode of the Sheils, Rawlinsons, MacNeills, and other diplomatists of Anglo Persian history, was by no means a bad mansion, and its gardens were superior in their way. As regards the official business on which 1 had been despatched, it may be said that the whole month of August, as well as one half of September, was taken up with ceremonial preliminaries to discussion, with visits and introductions. But 1 was able also to confirm, by personal proof, the impressions of Persian character derived from books, and that kind of chance intercourse with natives of Persia available to many officers in India. The languaffe should have a charm for all students, its O O grammar is so plain and intelligible, and its words are so musical. But its authors are untranslateable: and Sir William Jones himself has verified this assertion by bringing his own exquisite taste and talent to bear on English interpretations with but faint success. And the mysticism of books, the want of plain fact and plain phraseology in popular literature, the sacrifice of sense to style in the most ordinary writings of the day ; all these things are significant of national character.XI.J ORIENTAL DIPLOMACY. 547 Education starts 011 the falsest of false principles, and all study is of show and sound. Appearances are everything: realities nothing. In the abstract, politeness is rather a virtue than perfidy a vice, and good faith and honesty have little weight in the moral scale : nevertheless, circumstances may make it otherwise under the doctrine of expediency. Hence a vague mode of verbal expression and avoidance of matter of fact. Hence concealment of self and suspicion of others. And as diplomacy is supposed to comprise every form ot astuteness and craft, hence needless but conventional prolongation of negotiations with European powers, and the intervention of delays and difficulties on the most trivial of pretences. Added to this must be taken into consideration a perverse but perhaps fading habit, in the East, of vaguely associating Englishmen with unlimited means and money, which has, in the present age, to say the least, a retarding tendency in concluding Anglo- Persian treaties or conventions. During the month and a half in question I was pre sented to his Majesty the Shah by Mr. Alison, who further took me to call on the Sipah Salar, or virtual Premier; on the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mirza Said Khan ; and on the Minister of Science, better known as Ali Kuli Mirza, the Itizad-es-Saltaneh, or Right Arm of the State.' A second visit to the Minister of Foreign Affairs enabled me to broach the question of business, but the progress made, if entitled to be called progress at all, was hardly material : for the statesman, quaintly oblivious of my seven weeks' sojourn a t lehran and introduction to himself a full month before, asked the nature of my employment, and when duly re-advised, remarked, not on the gist of the proposed N N 2548 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. convention, but on the fewness of its articles. The Russo-Persian Telegraph Treaty, it was observed, con tained thirty-eight, and this had barely a third of that number. I called also on the Sartip, or Director-General of the Telegraph, Ali Kuli Khan, a Persian of above average intelligence, and with strong reasoning powers, wanting direction. But visiting was not exhausted in a Persian social atmosphere. Two dinners with Monsieur de Gricrs, the Russian Minister at Zergandah, close to Gulahak, the second in honour of the Emperor's fete day ; one dinner with the new-coming Turkish Minister, Khair Ullah Efendi, at his halting-place, twenty-five miles out of Tehran, and before entrance to the capital; frequent guests at our home mess; and a dinner every two or three days at the British legation ; besides one or two ' outings' of a friendly character, represented, more over, a status which placed me tolerably au courant with the local European society and gossip. So that when, on the 19th September, 1 was placed for the first time in real business communication with the Persian Govern ment, and broke ground in earnest with the Persian Foreign Minister, I knew tolerably well the people with whom I should have to deal directly, and what support or opposition, if any, might be expected from those who could only exercise either in an indirect manner. Not the least encouraging result of our interview on this occasion was the understanding on which we parted company, that I was to return to resume discussion on the clay following. My experience at Constantinople would not have led me to expect this continuous exertion on the part of the Turkish authorities. Oriental diplomacy is proverbially slow, and those whoxi.] OFFICIAL AND SOCIAL FESTIVITIES. 549 hope to find Persian statesmen faster than their neigh bours, will be mistaken, unless prepared to cut the knot by extraneous agency. Being myself naturally bound by civilized orthodoxies, and not accredited to negotiate on personal responsibility, I soon realised the mistake of excessive hopefulness, and of faith in brisk beginnin o 's ■ for the vigour of the prelude meant no more than a movement in adagio. Two more months passed, and we had failed to complete. But the verge of completion had then been attained, and my seventh visit to the Foreign Minister on the 15th November promised to be the last. So, happily it proved. Business was prolonged until a late hour, and when daylight was exhausted we had recourse to candles. The convention was signed and sealed by her Majesty's Minister, and the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the 23rd December, and in less than a fortnight from that date, I was well on my travels again. Certainly, if hospitality and mental and physical di version could compensate for official contretemps and annoyances, they were not wanting at any period of my sojourn on this occasion. Tehran was unusually favoured by European strangers at the close of the year. French and English travellers of distinction glided in from the ^ est; British-Indian homeward-bound visitors laboured up from the East. The Russian legation entertained occasionally and on a large scale ; the French charge- d'affaires received friends in a small but sociable way ; and as for the British mission, it was exceptionally festive : for my own part I almost seemed to live there. After the arrival at Tehran of Khair Ullah Efendi, the Turkish envoy, dinners, or rather banquets of welcome were given by England and Russia both. The British550 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. gathering was remarkable not only for the fusion of Persian and European society which it displayed, but for the ready manner in which the Ottoman diplomatist and Persian statesman descended from their conventional pedestals to join the mixed multitude assembled, in the ordinary and very unceremonious game of Pool. Hunting and coursing;—' la cJiassc,' as the thing was O O 7 o comprehensively interpreted to a mixed and polyglot society—consisted in riding about, for two or three hours, with two or three hawks, two or three dogs, and a train of galloping Persian attendants, looking for hares and par tridges. If we saw any unfortunate one of the first, off we went, following the dogs either steadily and deter minedly, or in fits and starts, according to the nature of country traversed. Always stony, it is at times a succession of pits and hillocks, difficult to cross with speed, steep and injurious to cattle : and the hound, scenting and tracking the bare, has been known to pass clean away from his masters, to be missed for the best part of an hour, and to be discovered in a ditch, ex hausted and showing signs of unbecoming deglutition. o o o o But its deeds are, in such case, at best obscure and doubtful. If we saw a partridge, the hawk was slipped, and the poor bird victimized or not, just as its flying served. This description of sport applies to the hare also, to deer and larger game: and it was no rare oc currence on the plains north of Tehran to fall in with antelope, or find horsemen to pursue them. Persians declare that the hawk will even kill an eagle by pouncing on the back of its neck, and thence directing its fierce onslaught upon the eyes and head. Although these people take apparently more delight in sport, the vigoui of which is, as it were, impaired by the introduction of aHfS MAJESTY THE SHAH. feathered assistant, than in the uncompromising hvmtino- of Europe, there is no lack of bold riders among theni.

The first had been a mere presentation incommon with some brother officers, and at one ot the king's country seats near Gulahak. 1 his one was os tensibly for leave-taking, though in reality, with the hope that it might promote haste in concluding the work on which I was awaiting the royal decision ; and it was held in town. The palace has an element of the pic turesque in exterior, and is distinguished by compara tively high towers rising behind the wide square, with its low buildings, tank and gardens. On first arrival, her Majesty's Minister, the Oriental secretary, and I, were shown into a waiting-room, at the top of which we found three vacant chairs as it were inviting us : two placed lower down the apartment, were already filled by Persians in respectable drab ' abas,' or long cloaks. After seating ourselves, we remained for some time in silent contemplation of odd old portraits and pictures with which the walls were covered. The first resembled the short-haired beauties of the reign of Charles 11., or the Sylvias and Perditas of later reigns. The second were varied, European or Asiatic. Among them was a group, in which the Virgin and infant Saviour were conspicuous. There was also a banquet reminding one ot the Don Quixote and Dulcinea period. When we had made a fair inspection of the subjects generally, the Master of the Ceremonies came in and took his seat next Mr. Alison ; offering an explanation for his previous ab sence, by the statement that the Russian Minister was still in conference with the Shah. In about half an houi more we were summoned to the royal presence, and imme diately put ourselves in movement. On our way we met the Russian Imperial envoy in full diplomatic^ uniform, attended by an attache similarly attired. We walked through courts, flowers, water-courses, tanks and s-o foith,XI.] PRESENTATION. ' 553 till we came to the royal locale. Here we took the cue from our Persian fugleman for the first mark of acknow ledgment, or performance of the old regulation military salute. It was given on the first sight of the king sitting 111 his sitting-room, as on a stage, with the curtain drawn aside. On we went a few paces: then salute the second. The regard which met us was, perhaps, more instructive than encouraging for debutants. We next entered a doorway and ascended a few steps, turned to the left, came into a small room with a curtain, which we lifted and passed on into another room, where salute the third was made in the royal presence. Her Majesty's Minister sat down as provided by treaty, and the secretary proceeded to interpret the brief conversation which en sued. His Excellency soon took occasion to bring me forward, and after I had replied to the questions put to me by his Majesty, chiefly relating to my proposed journey eastward, and evincing somewhat of kindness as of courtesy, leave was asked and taken, and the with drawal salute closed the stricter ceremonial observances of the day.

[chap. from the simple scratching on it of the name of Fath All Shah : the Aurangzeb ruby in the crown, massive but murksome : coats of poor cloth lavishly bedecked with the costliest jewels ; such were among the facts to which I can bear testimony. But last year the jewels, or many of them, were exhibited at Buckingham Palace. In speaking of the festive gatherings at Tehran, 1 must not forget an invitation from the ' Sipah Salar, a title corresponding with Commander-in-Chief, or leader of the army ; a high Minister of State, who though not exer cising - the concentrating functions ot a Grand Wazir, O ' approached the nearest in position to the holder of that often-suspended office. Before the close ot our telegraph proceedings, he asked her Majesty s Minister and a large number of European officials, to a banquet; and it was with much regret I found myself unable to attend from indisposition. That it was a grand affair was clcai to me from the reports of the guests, as well as from a choice bill of fare replete with French gastronomic technicalities, and headed by a lion and sun of the ap proved national pattern. 1 here was a cpiiet, courteous geniality about this nobleman which attracted me greatly towards him. I had gone to him one day when tele graph negotiations had entered an unpromising phase, thinking his aid and influence might avail me. A swelling in the foot, very probably gout, kept him to his bed, which was spread out in true Persian fashion on the floor. He made me draw my chair towards him, and we talked for a long time. The business portion of the con versation was hardly satisfactory ; but it was not a tissue of promises and set phrases.

Removed from head-quarters, there is a mystery about his further career. Whether he died 111 honoui at Mashhad, or under what circumstances historians will have something to say. The court chroni cler may have said it already. Let us hope it has been, or will be recorded with the fairness that is the very essence of history. A Minister of Foreign Affairs at Tehran cannot well be what is called a popular man with foreign legations ; and if those known to us by the more recent annals have not II sua 11} been so regarded, their shortcomings in this respect must be laid to the system as much as to the individual. Persian jealousy could not brook the notion that the representative of Government—in this case of the Shah himself—should be officially lost sight of as it were by the intervention of personal regard ; and that esteem or friendship for the man should be mingled with any consideration of the measure it is his duty to discuss, file old school, with its ingrained suspicion and narrow conservatism, is therefore not uncommonly resorted to for the selection of those who are to regulate the exterior relations of the State : and though it is not by any means to the more bigoted members of this class of politicians that power is thus offered and entrusted, yet are the556 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. chosen few quite wanting in the show of geniality—the empresse manner—by which the travelled Persian or the pupil of is distinguished. In their stead is found the old Persian phase of Oriental breeding ; pleas ing in its courtesy tmd polite address, but too artistic to be credited, and minus the majestic freedom from con descension and conventionality of the Arab host, and the stately ease with which self is forgotten by the Shaikh in the religious performance of a social duty. The incum bent on the occasion of my present mission, had been for many years in the post, and was there until very recently, when replaced by the ex-Grand Wazir. Among Orientals, he would be considered a man of much reading and general knowledge, and the mode in which his own appreciation of position and reputation is exhibited, would pass as the most consummate statesmanship. Among Europeans, opinion on such points may always be of different shades; but few, if any, could be expected to paint him in the colours used by a native limner. For my part, I met with courtesy and fair personal treat ment at his hands ; and was enabled to certify to the Minister's possession of a keen insight, savoir-faire, and other qualities which to my mind, rendered his original appointment as intelligible as the duration of his respon sibilities. His demeanour, without being morose or especially grave, was to some extent affected by palpable bodily infirmity, less of age than accidental sickness ; and he was not reserved in describing or dwelling on his phy sical complaints : but he could bear up vigorously against such outward assailants if his loyalty demanded the effort, and the Shah could not have had a more anxiously devoted or submissive servant. There were times when a French sentence, studiedly and smilingly uttered, wouldXI.] FAREWELL TO TEHRAN. 557 escape him, and on such occasions, the working of an under current of humour would appear on the surface. But it is high time to bid farewell to Tehran. Ere doing so, let us take a parting look at Demavend, the noblest and most graceful of Persian mountains, and the most beautiful feature in any landscape comprehending it, of which the Tehran entourage may form part. Fully clad in wintry white, heavily or lightly streaked, or only tipped with snow, according to the season and the cir cumstances of the year, it presents a spectacle in which the most hlase and fastidious of beholders can find no Haw. Young and impressible travellers will, on their side, regard it with enthusiastic admiration. 7 O On the 4th December, Major Murdoch Smith and I left Tehran for Ispahan, resolved to perform this part of the journey by ' chapar,' a process of locomotion already mentioned. Some kindly members of the Russian legation rode with us for a short distance from the town : but our fellow-countrymen had official indoor business to detain them. The get-up for these occasions must be regulated more or less by the season, but warm clothing is indis pensable in winter, and a great-coat should never be forgotten, though not always worn. High boots, cords, coats with multifarious and readily-accessible pockets, and a solar hat, may be considered fitting requisites for every temperature. It is usual for the European traveller to stow what baggage he cannot allot to his own horse on that of his personal attendant, and failing the sufficiency of this provision, to load there with the groom of the post-house, whose presence, or payment for whose supposed presence, is insisted on. Beer and books, preserved meats and wearing apparel, and essentials of the toilet, are commonly part of theTEL EG RAP 11 AND TRAVEL. contents of the saddle-bags; and a pistol and flask are almost always in the holsters. 1 take this opportunity of recommending my latest practice as worthy of imi tation : that is, to furnish the holsters as a dressing-case and pistol-case respectively, filling in the spare places with small articles of constant requirement. A Govern ment order for horses at the postal stations is procurable at Tehran, and should be provided : but where the traveller is known, or where his purse is freely opened, it is not exacted after the first change. Moreover, it may be taken for granted that incoming post-horses have been obtained under authority : therefore the same authority warrants the relief. Touching the quality of the cattle themselves it is to be borne in mind, ' that the horses are not necessarily fast because used for posting. Some move along heavily and lazily from first to last; some require great tact and effort to be brought into action at all; and some have actually no go in them. Nor is it un common for the ' chapar' horseman to get a cropper. He should avoid all sudden rises in the road, because the descent is dangerous to the ' chapar' horse in motion; and this course, difficult at all times, is at night im possible.' 1 The distance from Tehran to Ispahan may he roughly estimated at 250 miles of country easily recalled to memory. The first twenty-five miles are over com paratively fertile plains, ending with an ascent of barren, dreary hills, and a descent into a cluster of villages amid cultivation. The next sixty miles, leading to the sacred city of Kum, at the foot of a mountain range, are for the most part over sheer desert and unmitigated desolation. 1 The quotation is from my own ' Notes on Eastern Persia and Westom Baluchistan,' read at the British Association in 1866.xi.] AN UNMITIGATED DESERT. 559 The caravanserai and post-house of Hauz-i-Sultan ; tlie caravanserai at Sadrabad ; and the small post-house and bridge at Pul-i-Dalak, present the main features in the retrospect: away from these landmarks, carcases and skeletons would perhaps be the more notable symbols in the landscape. Well has part of this melancholy tract been called the plain of the Augel of Death. Local traditions make it a resort of yhouls, fairies, or spirits of some kind. We should imagine that they must be mes sengers of gloom, whom the wayfarer, seeking cheer and encouragement, would rather shun than welcome. Another sixty miles from Kum, brings the traveller, turning eastward from an otherwise southerly course, and skirting the line of mountains on his right, to the city of Kashan. This section of plain can boast of villages and cultivation ; and at Nasarpur, where the fine caravanserai provokingly invites to an extra halt, are melons as delicious, perhaps, as the world can produce. From Kashan the resigned and weary post-horse is urged, by his fretful and weary rider, across a plain of some extent, and for twenty-seven miles altogether, to the charming village of Kohrud, situated in the mountainous district whose name it bears. After a descent into the plains on the southern side of the range, and accomplish ment of another short twenty miles, the post station of Bideshk, or caravanserai of Sao, is next reached : and hence a further short sixty miles of country remain to l»e traversed before reaching Ispahan. By rising early, and converting the morning into the midday meal which it is commonly made in Persia, my comrade and 1 disposed of this distance before breakfast. Kum is held in high repute as a sacred city, second in importance to Mash had only. It contains the560 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

Kashan has not much more attraction as a residence, but it is deservedly famous for its silks and potteries. BRIDGR AT ISPAHAN. Ispahan has been so frequently and so well tie- scribed that I will not venture to linger in that city. Any notice of its monuments, bazars, piazzas and streets, would be superfluous ; any lamentations over its ancient o-lories and modern decadence would be platitudes. We visited the Chahal Situn and Sadri palaces, climbed the high staircase overlooking the Shah Mai- dan, experienced the reality of the shaking minarets, and ' did' many things which the reader would notxi.j julfa. 5(5! care to re-do with us in these pages. The general im pression of the place was that it must have fitly represented the regal state and grandeur of modern Persia. Independently of noble, though dilapidated exteriors, there was an attraction in the taste of the rooms and fittings, especially the ceilings and windows of palace interiors, non-existent at Tehran. As for the semi-barbarous paintings—the most notable figure in which is Fath Ali Shah, usually on horseback—I was impressed by their unmistakable individuality: but the stolid way in which the dramatis personce stick wild boar or destroy lions, looking all the time to the front, is ludicrous in the extreme. The cos tume of a period ranging from Charles 11. to George I. seems to be popular; and the ' pretty pages,' with ruffs and knee-breeches, or Louis XIV. coats and continuations, are quite numerous. Julfa is the head-quarters of the orthodox Arme nian Church ; the Archbishop here being supreme both in Persia and India. In 1865 I was informed that of their four schools (of which one is for girls) one hoys school was kept up by the subscriptions of a Calcutta merchant. The number of pupils in each was given at seventy. As a rule the Julfa clergy appeared very friendly and well disposed towards the biitish residents; and readily joined in their social gatherings. A day or two after arrival I had the pleasure of meeting, at the house of M. Stephen Agenor, the Archbishop, a monk, and two priests; and joining my kind host in welcoming the Archbishop, the monk and M. Agenor at our ow T n lodging the day following. A Christian Baghdad merchant formed on e acli occasion a pleasant addition to the dinner party. o oX '-J ' CY GIT KODOLFE.' 5 6 3 There are, moreover, tombstones with Dutch and French inscriptions ot the seventeenth century. Anions the last, I was struck by the words ' Cy git RodoJfe' on a long, wide slab. J'hey are said to mark the resting- place of a traveller or settler, who had killed a Muham- madan and was sentenced by the mullas to death. An ofler of pardon was made to the accused, but accom panied by the condition that he should renounce his own faith and become a Musalman. He declined the conditions, together with many inducements, and pre ferred to die in honour. The tomb, it is said, was at one time much visited by strangers. Ihe diary is now resumed from the date of quitting Ispahan ; or on the 18th December, 1865 ; ' Left at about 1 p.m. Passed, or sighted, the three bridges Aliverdi Khan, Kaju, and Jin: crossed another.

Here must have been the secret why the poor beast went tolerably well! March about fifteen miles—but had we gone by the right road, we might have saved two: at tirst over a country intersected with kanats and water-courses, most of them dry ; and fields under recent cultivation, amid swarms of pigeon-towers; then on a tolerably good road, leaving hills to our near right, one or two of the higher order having a snow-covered peak to the far left.

' December 19.—Turn out after tea, about 8 a.m ., and take observations on roof of caravanserai: S. with prismatic, 1 with common pocket compass. Gulnabad was formerly a large town, but was destroyed by the Afghans under Mahmud, in the days of Shah Husain Safavi. It was the scene of a great fight, and is a place of many graves as of ruins. March at about 10 a.m. and arrive at Sagzi at about 1.30 p.m ., 3^ hours, say fourteen miles. Part of the road white with salt efflorescence, part with frost. The country is almost a desert, although there are occasional patches of past cultivation. The caravanserai is a good one, but has been deserted by its guardians. Its archi tecture and solidity corroborate the truth of the statement that it was built by Shah Abbas. My informant says his father remembers the Afghan invasion; but as this was about 145 years ago, I am inclined to doubt his accuracy. We are further informed that they have had no snow here for long, though it has fallen in the hills : that there are about 70, '80, or 100 houses in the village, which is south of the caravanserai, and within walls: that there is a hamam here, built by Shah Abbas, still used, in the morning by men, in the daytime by women ; finally that there is no tobacco or cotton received from Yezd, but sugar.

The pits dug at intervals for these had a strange appearance in the mirage. The caravanserai, west of the village, is very solid and well built. There appear to be the usual number of rooms— i.e. twenty-four, with stables at the back, and uppt' 1 and lower rooms for hot weather. There are tombs outside, and an 2 Tanks.w iV XI.] HILLS NEAR ISPAHAN. 565 inclosed tank.^ A caravan of pilgrims, which was at the last sta^e, has accompanied us here. They had just reached Ispahan from Kerhela, and are now on their way back to Yezd. Take note of one or two small villages among the hills to our left. The last have been whitened by a fall of snow mingled with rain, during the night. The general aspect this morning was very beautiful; and we had a sunny and almost cloudless day. The wind blew strongly from the westward on our arrival. We have here apples, pomegranates and other fruit. 'December 21, 1865.—Laghara, 29 miles: 7 hours and 20 minutes, riding and walking. A bitter cold march. At eleven miles, Mushkinun, a large village with gardens, but comparatively deserted: pass at two miles to right. Imam Zadah Kasim, the gilt dome of which was visible. The road gradually rises to the lulls, amid which our course evidently lies. Enter them at about fifteen miles, having met the snow at Mushkinun. Fourteen miles iurther, Laghara, a village in a hollow, with poor accommodation. e are put up in the katkhuda's house, and our servants soon find fire. Xo one is forthcoming but a small boy, and he is made to show us our lodging. On the whole it was a very good one, and better than we were warranted to expect on arrival at a late hour, after passing the manzil (stage) whfch had been named to us, namely Mazra-i-Yezdi. Servants get great beams of wood, and an old door, and burn them in the room next ours, on account of the intense cold. They open also the katkhuda 's •stores of firewood and chopped straw. I object to the whole proceeding, but they assure me all will be well, and the man will receive his money. At present he is non inventus. S. orders three kirans to be given to the only man we can find, as a retain- mg-fee, and this seems to have a good effect. In the hills we passed several abddis, here called mazras, which consist generally of a few walled-in fruit gardens, a fort, apparently for the recep'- tion of inhabitants in case of attack, and often built on a mound, and one or two mud houses. From the leafless appearance of trees ' and sparseness of population, these mazras are not, however, very cheery to the traveller. What sad, habitual story tellers are these people ! Either they are unable to reply to the :v-A U56G TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap questions put to them, or they accept any suggestion of the questioner, and confirm it with the never-failing hali. 1 There is about six feet of snow on the ground. The sunset on these low hills is very grand. The highest points Qre perhaps l,o00 to 2,000 feet. Our caravan of pilgrims had halted also at Laghara. ' December 22.—Villagers turn out, and get presents or pay ment for goods, both men and women. I like to see this done. The system of plundering on the arrival of a ' gentleman' is not simply Persian, but Oriental, and the servants here do not seem to me worse than their Indian brethren. 'The king's servants take everything they find,' said one, thinking me very soft for questioning his proceedings. So it is, no doubt; but the custom is un-English, and unpalatable to Englishmen. Start at about 10 A.M., and reach our stage soon after 2 P.M., sixteen miles. Although we are well out of the snow and hills, bitter cold is Bambiz, where we meet with a most hospitable reception. Old HUji Husain gives us a capital, clean room—the best, by far, we have had on the road since leaving Tehran : and his little girls come and look at us through the trellised windows. Our march to-day was tortuous to some extent in the hills, but the general direction as we descended was east; a large plain was observed to the N.E., bounded by a range of hills, some of considerable height. In fact the whole country is very hilly, and many of these hills are solid rock, with abundant quartz and limestone. Pass a kujilc of camels with wheat, bound for Yezd, and with henna and clothes from Yezd. The last is exported from Minab and Karman. Had ocular demonstration to-day of the common custom of using a donkey to lead camels. With such aid, it is much easier tor the driver to change his line of direction than in trusting to camels only. When requisite, he seizes the donkey, almost like a child, turns him the way he likes, and the camels follow. On the whole, we find civility as we progress. The road salute i* often tendered us, and I invariably make a point of returning it ' December 23.—Naogumbaz, 12 miles.

Our course was easterly, over a plain bounded by high, rugged hills with sharp angular tops. There is a fine caravanserai here, and close beside it a chaparkhana ; for the post road at Kashan is met at this point. Choose the latter. W e had been gazed at last night at Bambiz as though we were wild animals, and the curtains had been drawn aside in the morning to exhibit us gratis at breakfast. But as our spectators were mostly children, the process was bearable ; and S. appropriately remarked on the inevitable sensation which would attend the appearance of two Persians, with a retinue such as ours, in an English village. Now and then, it is true, the older folks were detected looking through the crevices of doors, and adopting similar stealthy devices; but I firmly believe the main object was to gather that we were com fortable. No doubt we are the first, or nearly the first Europeans whose visit is recorded at Bambiz. From inscriptions on the wall we learnt that our landlord, his father, wife, and sister, had all performed the pilgrimage to the haramain, or sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. The first, however pious and strict a Muslim, was assuredly no bigot in his behaviour to Faringis. 1 When offered his toman, as a natural present for kindness and civility, he seemed loth to accept it, because our supplies had been paid for; a reasoning the application of which at such a time is no less gratifying in its rarity than warranted by its logic. ' December 24.—Akda, 26 miles, thus divided : twelve to an ah ambar, or inclosed reservoir, built by Hasan Akdai quite in the present day, where we breakfast; three more to a second reservoir and new caravanserai and fort, built by some munificent Keshti; eight to the village of Shahrabad, and three to station. The snow came gradually on us from the hills to our right, and lasted for some four miles ; but it was not so cold as yesterday. Akda was once apparently a large village, though it is now de serted. Its houses are for the most part inclosed by a w T all. 1 In December 1870, I again passed by Bambiz, and my old host, Haji Muhammad Husain, came to see me in tents.

' December 25.—It had already been my fate to spend a Christmas at little known localities, as for instance, in 1854 at Brahminabad, and in 18(&gt;1 at Iluki (which I leave to be dis covered on the map). This year the scene was to be Maibut, perhaps equally inconspicuous. 2 This last-named station we reach after a march of some thirty miles, or ten leagues as ac curately estimated by M. Eobio, about half a century ago. For the most part the road is dreary and wanting in villages. Jufta, the dilapidated caravanserai station at which we breakfast, barely deserves mention. But as we near our halt ing-place and look around, large villages are observed at various distances, telling of population and cultivation in spite of a certain mono tonous lifelessness and want of relief in their clay and mud colours. There is a rugged, untidy appearance in the environs of Maibut. The soil is in great vogue for building and potter}'. Consequently it has been indented and cut up to an enor mous extent, and after the most approved style of Oriental irregularity. But the most notable objects are the hills on either side. Those on our right approached to within a few miles of our march of to-day, and a new and picturesque range opens out as we advance. On our left the hills are distant, being divided from our road by a desert plain some forty miles in breadth, sloping down to a low valley like the bed of a river, and gradually rising on the further side, into regions of snow. Seldom have I beheld anything more enchanting than the higher of these mountains for an hour or two before sunset.

Our old muleteer, or assistant charwadar, started off this morning from Akda before ourselves. Snow had already come down freely and covered the ordinary road, and still continued to fall, so that all tracks of travellers were in parts wholly obliterated. The man had lost his way, and we had lost our dinner; for with him in his difficulty was the bulk of our commissariat. He is still missing at nightfall. ' December 26.—A Saiyid brought some specimens of pottery, four (Jciizas) jugs, which were stated to be pishkash, or presents. But it was not easy to carry them to Yezd and Karman. March about fifteen miles to Himatabad, passing many farms and a surprising amount of cultivation ; but inhabitants are sadly scarce. Much cotton grows here. The cypress and fir give pleasant shade to the landscape. The mountains, however, are the main scenic attraction. To-day our right-hand view is the finer.

The Hindus are from fifteen to twenty in number: the literal account rendered is fifteen traders and two servants. All, or almost all, are Shikarpuris. I recognized one or two faces among them. Some profess to remember me, and a practical instance in support of such profession is given by recalling a visit which I am stated to have paid, in company with the lieutenant of police, to a particular house in their native city. They wear the Persian hat, and are otherwise outwardly denationalised, but look what they really are, through all disguise of costume. No Jews called ; but I am told there are as many as a thousand, in cluding women and children. Truth is not always attainable in official statistics. When these are incidentally obtained from hearsay, and in the less known parts of Persia, they must be put to the arbitration of probability and common sense. I should roughly estimate the whole population of Yezd at 40,000, an eighth being allowed as a maximum for Parsis and non -Muham- madans. Called on the governor, known, moreover, as the 'general adjutant,' who received us in a friendly manner. He is- short, sallow-complexioned, round-faced, and of barely middle age; had been in London, Paris, and St. Petersburg, and speaks tolerable French, with the hesitation natural to one living far away from European centres. Tea, cigarettes, and the kalian, combined with conversation to temper the formalities of a first interview. Our friend the Darvish was present, and took hisXI.] YEZD. seat on the ground; the ' Nazim-ul-Tujjar,' 1 a commercial digni tary, and withal a fine-looking Tehrani Persian, also came. 'December 29.—Visit the town, after breakfast, on foot, ac companied by Hindus, who look on us as their special patrons. Return and receive visits from the Wazir, an elderly gentleman of common Persian type. The Hindus call again in a body. Visited also by the Malik-ul-Tujjar, or head of the merchants of Yezd, who looked so well in his native turban that we could not but inwardly congratulate him on the fortune which saved him from his native hat. Spoke to him about the Hindus, and commended them to his care. 'December 3-0.—Yezd is situated in a sandy plain, high and open, between two ranges of mountains, running, in a general direction, from north-west to south-east. On the west is the open country from Kashan ; on the east an apparent desert dividing the province from Sistan, and little traversed by man and beast. The mountains north of Yezd are fine, and in certain lights picturesque; those to the south are, however, the more remarkable, and boast one or two peaks of great height, bold, rugged, and fantastic; presenting at all times a beautiful view, and worthy of more notice than a faint line or blank in our best maps. 2 Silk is here manufactured, the raw material being obtained in the neighbouring villages; but it is probably inferior to that of Ghilan. It is included among articles of export, as are also hennas, 3 dyes, cottons, and felt carpets. 4 Wheat is imported; for the patches of cultivation around the town, and neighbouring towns or villages, afford an insufficient supply to the inhabitants. The streets are wretched and blank like those of most Persian towns, but not especially dirty. There must be about fifty mosques, of which the Jama Masjid has a fine, high frontage, overlaid with the pretty blue tiles so 1 The Arabic article ' al ' or ' ul ' takes the sound of the initial consonant of the next word, and is pronounced ' ut.' 2 This deficiency is now being remedied, and the surveys of Major Murdoch Smith, K.E., in 1866-7, and Quartermaster-Sergeant David Bower, R.E., in 1871, will, it is hoped, be turned to good account. 3 Chiefly from Khabis. near Karman. 4 From Taft near Yezd.TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. jchap. common at Tehran. There are other mosques, as also caravan serais worthy of note; and of the ' maidans/ or piazzas, the Shahi Mardan, the Maidan-i-Khan, and the Cliakmak may find a corner in the traveller's diary; the first, because it is the scene of the great annual festival of the Muhammadans, or.' Place du Muharam ;' the second from its bustle and traffic; the third from some local associations which have given it its name. Yezd is supplied with water according to the season. If snow or rain be plentiful, it is well for the inhabitants; otherwise there is an inevitable scarcity. This year the snow seems to ensure a good supply. Call on the governor again to-day, and take leave; also on the ' Sarhang/ to whom we owe a visit, the Wazir, and the Malik-ul-lujjar; and look in upon the Hindus at the caravanserai, before returning to our quarters. The principal Hindu now here is one Sahib Ivae, gumashta, or agent of Jairam Das, a wealthy trader of Shikarpur; but the names of Nandaram and Daiaram, other Shikarpuris whose agents are also in the place, are more familiar to me. It is a matter of wonder how these men venture so far from their own native country, as to \ezd, Bukhara, and other cities of Persia, central Asia, or Afghanistan, to exercise a narrow traffic and precarious usury among men ol a totally different creed, and iconoclasts of the strongest type. But the Shikarpur Hindu is proverbial for his wandering propensities. We visited the shawl manu factory, and greatly admired the striped and flowered patterns. ihe governor gave us, as before, a cordial and courteous reception. He spoke much of the pottery for which the country from Kashan to Yezd is famous, and showed us certain spe cimens ot blue and white delf, which would have been more pleasing, had the designs been Persian instead of weak imitations of Chinese drawings. The chief manufactory is at Nain, on the north-west frontier of Yezd; but Kashan itself, Maibut, and doubtless other places in the neighbourhood possess their skilled artizans. 1 remember the story being current at Tehran, that one out of forty young Persians, who had been sent to Europe to undergo a course of training in various branches of science and manufacture, returned to his native land skilled, as hexi.] PALE ALE IN PERSIA. 57:3 thought, in pottery, and was deputed to Nain to impart a new knowledge to its workmen. The result was that he could teach them nothing, but rather found that he had much to learn from his own countrymen. His Excellency to-day was attired in a shawl-coat, bordered with lace; wore a satin spotted neck-tie, passed through a ring, with turned-down collars; and otherwise showed his independence of any set national costume. He broke through, in our honour, the usual tea, coffee and kalian routine, by insisting on opening a bottle of pale ale, an article we did not expect to recognise in longitude 54, and latitude 31. In sober seriousness, our whole treatment at Yezd was un exceptionable, and will ever be cited by me as one out of many examples of Persian friendliness and hospitality, gleaned in personal experience. The following is a strange story, illustra tive of Oriental men and manners :— In the later days of lath Ali Shah, a royal prince was governor of Yezd. Called away to Tehran for a time, he left his government in the hands of a trusted minister. This last, in lieu of honourably fulfilling his trust, played ' fantastic tricks,' like Angelo, and when his master returned, refused him admittance into the town. A siege ensued, and the riddling of the fort-walls with balls. Finally, law prevailed, and the graceless Wazir fled towards Sistan, turning to seek refuge (bast) in Mashhad. Hence arts and promises prevailed on him to emerge, and come to lehran. Once in the capital, he was handed over to the harem of his outraged master, and stabbed and hacked to death with scissors! December 31. Ihe fruits of Yezd are delicious and plentiful; but would not suffice to tempt Europeans to a prolonged residence in this remote city. Yesterday, a fine buck was brought in. 'We have been presented with venison and feathered game, with cigarettes, and wine, said to be sherry but very like brandy; in fact, we have been surfeited with good things. To-day we were visited by the brother of the merchant chief, who had been to Bombay and Mecca; by relatives of the Imam Juma, whose title corresponds in some way to that of bishop of the diocese; by the head Tarsi, and a companion; and one or.'&gt;74 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. two more. March out in the afternoon to Muhamraadabad, a short ride of little more' than two hours, passing on the way some gardens and other cultivated land. This village seems to consist of one long street, with a row of mulberry-trees on either side, and many water-courses. Judging from the show of spectators of our entry, it should have a tolerably large popu lation. As every available man, woman, and child must have been turned out, we might venture an estimate of 600 or 700. Our host was the son of the Nazim-ul-Tujjar, and performed his part with courtesy and credit. We were located in a long room with skylights, and ornamented with transparent marble slabs, much in use here, and obtained from the neighbouring quarries. Our menu of the day was as follows — rice in profusion and well boiled ; fowl stewed with prunes; meat, minced and fried into flat cakes; pigeons and game birds swimming in grease; chickens roasted to chips, salt and dry; scraps of good cheese, with herbs and excellent fruit. Few large towns of Persia that cannot produce wine of some description : that of Yezd is thick, and not superior. 'January 1, 18G6.—New Year's Day.

The 'Shir- kuh,' rising majestically out of clouds on our right hand, or somewhat north of west, is here considered, with pardonable inaccuracy, the highest mountain in Persia. What studies for artists are to be found in these sharp Persian hills and beau tiful skies! The stately stillness cannot but strike the beholder who is alive to these impressions; but the light veil thrown over the whole colour of the landscape is to me always the greatest charm, as it is one of the special peculiarities of Persian scenery.

Road here and there slightly rising, but for the greater part level; sandy or -stony, and barren and desert in character and surroundings. 'January 2.—March to Zain-u-din, 19 miles. Road for the most part hard and good, occasionally sandy and undulating. We follow the range of snow hills on our right, and find our halting-place near a spur liom these running eastward. The hills on our left run eastward from the Yezd plain; and a branch trom them, taking a southerly and south-westerly direc tion, forms to our front a kind of amphitheatre with a space of some miles between, through which passes the Karman road. Zain-u-din has a caravanserai of solid burnt brick, built with luxurious completeness by Shah Abbas; a circular hexagon, of which the gate forms, as it were, a side. Five good travellers' rooms face a similar number in the inner court; and there are stables and other rooms at the back. Above, the rampart and casements tell a tale of local insecurity and anarchy; and the partial delabrement looks more the result of violence than of age; but the assailants, whoever they may have been, Baluchis or Bakhtiaris, could not effect actual demolition. The position is as isolated as can be imagined. All in the immediate neigh bourhood is a blank; there are no provisions, the water is salt, and wood is scarce indeed. An old custodian is living here, and may have lived here for years. Should there be no passing caravans, his physical subsistence would seem precarious: other- ^ise, his being stagnates rather than vegetates in retrospection. As for current events he neither knows or asks anything; he cannot say who is governor of the province in which he resides or who is his minister. January 3.—Karmanshahan, 16 miles. Road over plains, with slight ascent, between snow-tinged rocky hills, averaging 800 feet, on the right, and a low range on the left. There is a good, new, casemated caravanserai here, just built by the present Wazir of Karman, in whose praises the wall-distaining poets are profusely eloquent.

For a minute I will break off from the diary to venture upon a separate retrospect of Shams, in the caravanserai of which little-known locality J woke on the morning after arrival. It is early. The daylight penetrating a hole in the dark, vaulted roof, enables me to inspect the room in which my comrade and I have spread our bedding. Its height may be reckoned 22 feet; its length and breadth 18 by 12. On my side, the right, facing the single door—it will be understood there are no windows-are three large recesses in the wall (takchahs) of about four inches in depth; and below these are two of smaller outline but twice as'deep, useful to us for depositing articles of apparel or daily requirement. The centre upper recess has a corre sponding one on the opposite side, flanked by blocked- up, or nearly blocked-up arches. Two archways below these have been utilized as cupboards. The one nearest to Major Murdoch Smith has been covered to keep out the wind by a curtain on which a lion and sun, together with other lions, red deer, and peacocks, supply a charac teristic, if not always a cheerful subject of contempla tion. The walls and floor are of solid burnt brick, the walls, roof, recesses, and archways being quite black with smoke and age. So solid and massive are its large &gt;iick squares, that the floor appears to be of cut, quarried stone. Our fireplace consists of a central hole w the ground, whence the blaze from the brushwood, ecring in itself, but blinding in its attendant smoke, iscends towards the perforated roof.

He is clearly out of sorts, and not by any means enchanted at our visit. It is pos sible, however, that the room we occupy may have been his own. His fine black cat seems to point to such a conclusion ; for she comes in and out at pleasure, dunks the stranger's drinking water, sleeps on the stiauger s bed, eats bones or similar perquisites, and purrs con stantly in clear approval of her treatment.

On our left a tine mountain range, with Kuh-i- Kawar and Kuh-i-Zarand far away.

The snug chaparkhana at this place is in charge of an old woman, and the bread and water provided are simply delicious. Fall in with gipsies. Some of the women have handsome faces; and are importunate as usual. They go by the name of Kalha- hand or Gfiurhati, 1 of which the first may signify the necessity imposed on them of manual labour, and the second the nomadic nature of their lives. The caravanserai has been lately built by a Yezd merchant. 'January 8.—Bahramabad, 25 miles; over a road of which the first half, or nearly two-thirds, is not so good as on the previous days. Pass the villages of Husainabad, Hormuzabad, Dehanabad, and IVXehdiabad. \\ e have now reached a very flourishing and rising town, situated in the head-quarters of the Ivarman cotton districts, of quite recent institution ; and owing its immediate success to the inundations which ruined the neighbouring ' Kaleh Agha,' together with its selection as a postal station by the Amir Nizam, or former Prime Minister in Persia. Besides cotton there is much wheat grown, and castor oil abounds; mulberry trees are also to be found. Visited by the local governor and resident agent of the Karman Minister.

The caravanserai here was built by the Beglerbeg of Karman twenty-two years ago. Noticed lately a curious method of digging and throwing up earth embankments in small fields. Two men work together; and while one digs, the other holds the arm of the spade by a cloth tied round it, pulling it to him as his fellow turns the earth. This arrangement is primitive, but believed to be common hereabouts. Kuh-i- Darawan is among the hills to the left of our road. 'January 10.—Baghin, 30 miles; a march broken by a halt and breakfast at the midway ' Rabat,' or caravanserai. The road is between low ranges of mountains, across a high alluvial plain, stony or with gravel, and much strewed with wild vege tation, as yesterday. The more productive soil seems to be at the immediate foot of the hills where flocks and herds are seen col lected. Kabat is near the hills, on our left. In the neighbourhood is much cultivation, and there are one or two villages. The caravanserai is a splendid structure, built by the present Minister of Karman about two years ago, a functionary who is quite the Marquis de Carabas in these localities. Baghin has a caravanserai, and is a village of about seventy houses, mostly inclosed within a mud wall. Those outside present a ruined appearance. There is not much cultivation visible around; but there are signs of agricultural activity, and oxen ploughs are working until sunset. The hills to E.S.E. and S.E. loom out largely, and are covered with snow.

No one seemed to know to whom it was dedicated, or whose tomb it covered.CH.

The difficulty in reaching it from its nearest sea-port, Bandar Abbas, is gicat, owing to the mountainous nature of the interven ing country; and the distance is so considerable that it hclioves all those who seek a rapprochement between Persia and British India to give attention to the best means of intercommunication by land. Karachi seems to be the natural point of meeting ; and although the roads now joining that port to Karman city make the aggregate of miles to be traversed verge on a thousand, I cannot but think that were there a good safe connecting highway through Bampur, either by the sea-coast and Gwadar, or the Kej valley, impetus would at once be given to a most desirable traffic. Moreover, a great obstacle would be removed to immediate action, and a practical course laid down, in the matter of a railway to India ; whether such inevitable mark be attained by Government, by private enterprise, or individual philan thropy. At least, political preliminaries have, in this instance, been disposed of by recent definitions of territorial boundary. We remained four days at Karman, most hospitably and honourably cared for by the late Muhammad Ismail Khan, Wakil-ul-Mulk, then Minister of the nominal governor Prince Kaiomars, son of Kahraman Mirza, 1 and afterwards governor himself.

Yesterday we w T ere favoured with raki; but to-day a Parsi brings us two bottles of country wine, which is agree able to the taste, but not equal to the description given by the Mihviandar, who pronounces it the finest wine in the country, warranted free from all ingredients of headache. The latter, somewhat illogically, asserts he has never tasted it himself; but fortifies his judgment upon it by a story to the effect that a former Karman ruler, Khan Baba Khan, tasted every local wine procurable, and gave the preference to Karman produce. Kinnier makes Khabis fifteen days' journey from this place, and the maps follow his data. Here they tell me it is a flourishing town at a distance of 14 farsahhs only, or about 50 miles.

On other British Ministers in Persia he discoursed in a like kindly strain, from personal knowledge or repute; then turned the subject to Afghanistan, news of which country he received from the native paper published at Karachi. From this and Central Asian politics he came to the object of our journey, and here some difficulties presented themselves to his mind. Evidently he did not care to have the telegraph at his head-quarters; he suggested that a better road might be found for it from Yezd to the sea-coast than through Karman. As it was, S., who wished to reach Bandar Abbas, could not proceed by the direct route, which was impassable from the snow. He would have to ac company me four marches towards Bam. With regard to my once projected course, he could answer for me to Bampur; but how to proceed thence to Gvvadar was not so simple. He him self* had had to send his engineer to that part of the coast in disguise; and he strongly advised me to assume the Baluch costume for the second part of the journey, having donned the Persian hat for the first. Our servants were summoned, and subjected to a cross-examination on their qualifications and antecedents. Muhammad Kahim looked alarmed ; but Hassan, the pahlmvdn (or ' athlete') stood the test well, smiling at his discreet inquisitor's caution to avoid practising his professional tricks on the Baluchis.

Return home to breakfast; and after break- fast are escorted to the bazaar; a goodly collection of shops, the new section of which is on a large and solid scale. Visit two shawl karkhdnas (manufactories), and one for carpets. 1 1 Major Murdoch Smith says :—' In making the carpets, the threads (all of one colour) forming the length of the web are stretched on an upright loom consisting of two horizontal rollers. The cross coloured threads that form the pattern are worked in by as many small boys as the breadth of the web will allow to squat in front of the loom. As the work progresses, the web is gradually rolled up on the lower roller. After every two or three rows have been worked, wide-teethed combs are inserted in the wool, and hammered down with a mallet, to keep the carpet close and firm. The master-weaver draws and colours the designs on paper, ruled to represent the different threads ; after which he teaches the pattern to the pupils, who commit it to memory. The shawls are woven in a similar manner, almost the only difference being that the looms, or rather frames, are horizontal instead of upright. The memory of the workmen cannot possibly be assisted by seeing the pattern develop itself, as they always work with the reverse side of the web upwards. The hnrkhanahs, or workshops, in which the weaving is carried on, are such low, dark, miserable rooms, that one cannot but wonder that they should produce such beautiful manufactures. The shawls vary in price from 5 to 50 tomans (20/.), and fine carpets cost as much as from 4 to 10 tomans the square yard. Very few of the finer sort are made for sale in the bazaars, almost all being made to order for grandees in all parts of the kingdom. The spinning and dyeing of the wool for the carpets, and the kurk for the shawls, are also carried on in Karman, which thus pro duces the raw material and completes its manufacture.'

How an English lad of the same age and under similar circumstances would sigh for out-door pleasures ; and for him, m hence would arise the contentment visible in the sickly countenance of the young Karmanis ? ' Our progress through the town to-day was the cause of much excitement and curiosity on the part of both sexes. The Minister has announced a visit for to-morrow morning, an hour after sunrise ! The active old gentleman has clearly no sym pathy with sleepy travellers. The Prince sent us two large trays of sweetmeats. We are to make our call on him to-morrow. 'January Hth. —Visit from the Wazir before breakfast. He was blithe and fatherly, and full of anecdotes. He talked much of Dr R, like whom, he declared, he had never seen a doctor in Persia; giving force to the assertion by adding that he who said to the contrary lied ! Had he not foretold that Kahraman Mirza would die in five years, if he did not take care ; and had not the prediction been fulfilled, almost at the time specified? Called on the Prince, whom we tound a good-looking young man of about two- or three-and-twenty; and by whom we were re ceived in a neat apartment, in a gentlemanly and unostentatious manner. The shape of his face and its rich brown complexion ^ere well suited to the custom of young Persia, which scrupu lously removes all debateable hair save that on the upper lip ; his fine eye, though somewhat reddened, was not yet dimmed by dissipation ; and the toilet would have been quite passable in a European sense, notwithstanding the trimmed Karman shawl- cloak and striped military trousers, but for the loud pattern of the under garment with its many flowers. If conversation, the same word is used in Turkish to mean the ' pelisse ' commonly worn by Oj-manlis and other Muhammadans. It is one of the chief exports from Karman to India. i -k li' i ■&gt;588 TELEGHAFH AND TRAVEL.

Called also on the Mnjtahid, or High Doctor of Divinity. We found him sitting with a small party, among whom was the Imam Juma, and the Wazir's ycung son, a smart boy of about fifteen. The reception was cordial, and conversation pleasant and uncon strained. 1 am inclined to write down this mujtahid as good a Mussulman as can be imagined, and as liberal and free from prejudice as can be looked for among any in his position. The Hindus at Karman seem less demonstrative than their brethren at \ ezd : in number there are about fifteen. Our presents to-day from the Khan consisted of large game, fruit, and four kinds ot ice—lemon, cinnamon, saffron, and peppermint water. We learn that the old fort here, called by some Kaleh-i-Dukhtar (virgin lort) or Kaleh-i-Ardashir (fort of Ardashir), was built by Ardashir Babagan, son of Babak, and conqueror of Karman, according to Persian history in an English dress; but son of a shepherd, and born at Shahr Babak (the town of Babak), as I am told here. ' January Ibth. —\ isited the Khan at an early hour to take leave, and thank him sincerely for his great civilities. He had before told us that the requirements of his position, one of which was the yearly supply of a considerable sum 1 to the royal coffers, made him a merchant as well as minister ; and, not unexpectedly, we found him deeply engaged in business. Much of his time, indeed, must have been passed among his bales and papers. But just as he could turn, in an instant, from personal cares to the details ot provincial administration, so was he always ready to give attention to the cases and claims of individuals. He iiad the character of knowing the history of every resident in 1 Mr. Mark ham (' History of Persia') says 200,000 toinilns (£8^,000).

Our last interview gave us no cause to change the high estimate before formed of his friendly consideration. I wished him to name some article of English or Indian manufacture he would allow me to forward from Bombay, as the merest souvenir of a short but pleasant ac quaintance. Reiterating an assertion that he needed nothing but reciprocity of kindly feelings, he said, if I insisted on sending something, let it be a translation of the history of Persia, which he had understood the friend of his boyhood, Sir John Malcolm, had written. On his part, he would give me a written account of Karman. 1 Like all his countrymen, he had quaint superstitious notions. One was that, until arrived at forty, no mans judgment was to be trusted. Up to that age lie hold all acts committed to be more or less of the nature of mistakes ! Another was in the infallibility of ' mumia,' a kind of resin exuding from rock, to serve as a cure and prophylactic in physical emergencies. The tiny box which was placed in my hands this morning, though its contents had the semblance ol ordinary salve or ointment, was to my mind a signal proof of regard, and valued accordingly. At the same time, I fear that iad I needed the virtues it was assumed to possess, I should lave been at a loss for the means of practically eliciting them. The specific would nerve the system to meet danger, or restore it when the danger had passed, besides exercising a more palpable medicinal power; but I was not quite clear 5 on the mode of application, or whether internal or external, or oth. 2 A furthe r token ot the Khan's especial favour towards . . r&gt;,,)th P r&lt; ' mises hav e been fulfilled.

' January 16.—A mischievous story about one of our atten dants related to me by Mirza M. to exalt his own character and prove his disinterested devotion to our service, put me to the inconvenience of being my own Munshi and addressing a lettei of some length to the Wazir. Despatching the same to Karman without acquainting the Mirza, I received a letter in reply con- | firming me in my impressions of double dealing on the part o this Indo-Persian, whom I dismissed in no agreeable mood. We are located in an outer court, as it were, of the shrine ot Niamat Ullah, where the building seems intended to afford ac- ii commodation to pilgrims. The rooms are compact and soli y constructed of baked bricks; quite in keeping with the dura be caravanserais already noted in this province. ^ L aie | ^ 1 When the Mission under my orders was at Bam on its way t') in 1871, and again on its way to Sistan in 1872, no plea would .f ,tt \ C r e J 0 /..,! a cure admission to this fort for any of the officers composing it. m ri Governor expressed himself powerless in the mattei.x'] THE SHRINE AT MA HUN. 5i)l over to the shrine, and received there by a septuagenarian dar- vish, whose son, a line, well-looking man, below middle a^e, attends us in oui quarters. I he old man's story reminds me of the three last vicars of my home parish, who had between them occupied the post a full century and a half. His father had lived till ninety years or more, and he himself bids fair to follow the paternal example. The family had been custodians of the shrine lor twelve generations. AVe ascend to the outer roof, and as oui ^&gt;uide pioposes a visit to the interior, under the blue dome, we turn to continue our inspection. But having descended and approached the entrance, we are stopped by a request to take off our boots; and equipped as we are for travelling, it becomes a question whether curiosity shall be satisfied at^the cost. Declining to press the matter, T was about beating a polite retreat, when the old darvish invited us in, all booted and spurred. Contenting myself with an inspection from the threshold, I saw the handsome tomb of Yezd-like marble, and a beautiful carpet worked by Ustad Husain, the head craftsman of Karman. The shrine was covered with books, and overhung with large dark eggs, in size like those of the ostrich. Ride from Mahun in a S.S.E. direction, keeping the Jufar mountain on our right and high Karman range on our left, for some fourteen miles; when we reach the snow elevation and follow a wet and slippery winding path turning from S. to S.E. for about four miles, till we perceive three rock caves and soon afterwards the cara vanserai of Kanaka, built by the Khan. The ice and snow had been quite recent; weather moderately cold; but scenery most desolate. It is said that both copper and coal are to be traced in the neighbourhood. My ghulam, or guide, is a great sports man, and brings in two fine kabaks (partridges) and the smaller tl]m ' a11 acceptable additions to our table. His tall hat (Ma) and spectacles give him a strange appearance; and he has a strange way of attaching the last to the first, dropping them to the bridge of his nose when required. The reigning Shah must he credited with the sensible reduction of the kulla w-liich had attained, and threatened among certain classes to attain still more, preposterous dimensions. The story goes that, so strictly592 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. had the regulations on the subject been carried out in Tehran, that the sentry posted at the public entrance leading to the royal palace had instructions to measure any hat of suspicious size whose wearer ventured to pass his beat, and if the prescribed length were found to be transgressed, the knife or scissors came into instant requisition. 'January 17.—March to Eaiun, about twenty-six miles; of which the first ten are over snow-covered hills to the caravanserai of Kaleh-i-Shor. Into this, if the traveller feel disposed to enter, he finds a low room in the centre of the building open to the front. Should such accommodation be insufficient, he creeps under a small archway, visible on either side, through a mere hole, to resume a standing position only when under the vaulted roof within. Here he has a room divided by domes and arches into four separate sections; and each dome is pro vided with a central orifice for the passage of light and air. I should not recommend halting at this caravanserai, which is the reverse of cheerful. Two miles further, and we commence a descent from the hills : the last eight or ten miles being over a stony plain through which a road has been to some extent marked out and cleared. Our istikbal is headed by the zabit, a well-dressed smart village officer, attended by two cavaliers and a donkey rider. As we pass among the houses, walls, and gardens, a goodly number of villagers turn out to meet us. We are shown into capital quarters, and treated as guests of the Karman governor. 'January IS. —Detained all day at Raiun, the snow falling heavily: but we are well enough cared for, and have fair quarters in a spacious court which seems to have served the purpose of a caravanserai.

We follow a high road in general direction S.E. by E., for about fourteen miles, over a large, open, and slightly undulating plain. Muleteers then turn off to the left and take a north-easterly course over heavy ground, and a kavir, or salt marsh. After some four miles we reach and follow, first east and then south, another road, for the most part in the bed of a rud-khana, or mountain-fed river, and eventually come upon Tahrud at the foot of a tolerably' high range of hills, just where this torrent seems to have expended itself. The prospect here is very desolate, notwithstanding cul tivated patches. How Pottinger calls this a a town, I can'only explain from the false replies commonly given to a stranger's questions, or from some misapprehension. 'January 20.—March to Sabristan, or Sarvistan, twelve miles first in the unlooked-for direction of S.S.W. and afterwards, east ward of south, to a steady course of S.S.E. From broken ground and torrent beds we come to a tolerable track, and eventually meet the road we had followed for fourteen miles on leaving Eaiun yesterday. Three miles out of Tahrud we passed a fine, picturesque fort and ruins on our left. Might not this be the town of Pottinger, laid down in maps? oris the latter Awar, a village of 200 houses, fourteen miles N.N.W. of Sabristan and seven from Tahrud?

Major S. quitted me after breakfast this morning. We parted with mutual good wishes, and hopes of speedy re union on the coast ot Makran. My instructions to Major Murdoch Smith, dated the day before we separated, contained the following pas sages :— ' So much will depend on your own discretion and judgment; you are also so well acquainted with what are our present ob jects in ascertaining the several routes from one line of land telegraph to another; and how essential it is to keep clear of all political questions in our intercourse with the inhabitants ol the coast; that I will abstain from hampering your movements by any further or more definite proposals hereon. ' It is probable that I may reach Charbar about the 12th or 14th proximo, when it would give me great pleasure to meet you again. But I can neither ask you to detain the steamer, nor to guide your plans by mine, as it is impossible for me to anti cipate my movements beyond Bampur, which I am led to expect may be reached on the 3rd February. Besides, if it were prac ticable to proceed from the latter place to Gwadar direct, 1 should prefer adopting that route, as one hitherto untravelled b\ Europeans^' The official results of the double journey have been already stated. 1 And, independently of submission to Government, my diary from Sabristan to the coast has 1 Chapter V. pa^e 280 naff.x '0 CAMPS FAIRLY DIVIDED. 595 ioug ago been before the pul)lic. 1 In relating, therefore, a fresh story on the subject, I will endeavour to avoid undue repetition and prolixity. Lcmg sight and a pocket compass were sufficient aids to get a fair notion of the country we were travers ing; and it became very evident we had made two marches instead of one. After leaving Kaiun, had we not turned off to Tahrud, we might have pushed on at once to Sabristan ; or having turned off to Tahrud, my comrade and I might have parted there, and one march thence by direct road would have taken me to Darzin. As it was, I had about eighteen miles to accomplish to reach the latter place from Sabristan. But remedy there was none. The arrangement had probably been made in pure consideration to ourselves, and to keep us to gether to a point held mutually convenient for dividing camps. Itemonstrance, therefore, having become vain, we had nothing left but to start each according to the way chalked out for us, and this we did. My suite consisted of the guide, Hashim Beg; two personal servants, one of whom, Hassan the athlete, had at least a commanding physique; the muleteer; and a small boy, who sat, in elevated position, on a well- packed white pony. On our right was the noble 1 Journal of Royal Geographical Society, vol. xxxvii, pages 284 to 297 mcluaiye.

On our left was a low, rocky range of irregular hills \ and before us, as we moved east ward, was a vast open space into which we were steadily advancing. Two uneventful marches over a sparsely- cultivated and poorly-peopled tract brought us to Bam. The stage intervening has its historical associations of the age of Rustam; but, in its bare modern reality, is little more than a caravanserai. Bam—properly Bahm, if it really take its name from Bahman, the supposed founder—is a large town of, it may be, five or six thousand inhabitants, situated on a high plain, between a mountain range to the south and low rocky hills north, amid gardens and cultivation. Before the formal annexation of large tracts east of Narma- shir, it had a political as well as strategical importance from its position as the frontier town of South-eastern Persia. Now it is better known as the capital of the Bam-Narmashir district, conveniently situated in a high way leading to Karman, Sistan, and Bampur respec tively. 1 The reported slaughter of prisoners and erection of a pile of heads there, by Agha Muhammad Khan, after his defeat of the gallant Lutf Ali Zand, and the rebellious resistance offered forty years later within its 1 One of the names of Bam is said to have been ' Arba,' which in Arabic means ' four,' and supposes a fourth road to Khurasan.

During my stay here, w T hich extended one day over that of arrival, I took occasion to inspect the stronghold, drinking a cup of the commandant's tea en passant; and to receive visits from any persons dis posed to call. Among these were the garrison doctor, a sallow-faced, intelligent Karmani, dressed in a red cloak and shawl turban; the local governor's brother-in-law, and my acting host, owing to the governor's absence; and an individual who remembered me at Karachi. The doctoi said the mUmia 1 possessed was greatly prized, and only procurable from a hill or rock at or near Ba- bahan, between Shuster and Shiraz, in the south-west of Persia. trom Bam to Regan, a distance of about sixty miles, the road runs through the district of Narmashir ; and for two-thirds of the way among farms and forts pro moting or protecting cultivation. The population, too scant for the fertile soil, is essentially pastoral and agri cultural : and villages such as Kruk, Naimabad, Azizabad, and, quite recently, AVakilabad, give speaking testimony to the industry and resources of their inhabitants. But iu this country, as in Russia before the serf emanci pation, the want of a wealthy farming, or independent rural community is fatal to real progress. Industry does not go ahead and thrive on its own account : labour is the peasant s ; but its produce, save the sorry hire, is that of j 1:1)1 j598 TELEGRAPH AND TRA VEL. [chap. the man in power.

The next march brought us to the populous village of Nairnabad, the walls of which too closely confined its numerous inhabi tants. Our arrival here was productive of a slight dis turbance lor the man on whom we were billeted seemed at first unwilling to give us the asked-for accommodation ; and no sooner had he been talked over by my Persian attaches, than bis ladies appeared at the door of the room required, and stormed loudly. Seeing Hassan quietly appropriating the quarters at this particular juncture, I felt bound to censure his proceedings; but no harm had been done. The billet was accorded, and com plete pacification ensued. The third march from Bam was to Regan, when we left the more fertile lands and gradually descended to a vast, open, hard plain, with scattered, wild vegetation. As the plants and bushes thickened, the ground became less level and more sandv Re gan itself was barely visible among the low jungle until we had just reached it Murtaza Kuli Khan, the sarhang, eldest son of the Wazir of Karman, was at the time of our arrival at this station, halting there on his way to Bampur, with a detachment of sarhaz and guns. With him also in camp was Ibrahim Khan, governor of Bampur. The former had been prepared by his father for my arrival, and anticipated any movement I should make towards acquaintance by a message asking which of us should call upon the other first ? Pahluwan Hassan answered that 1 was tired with travelling: so the sarhang himself came to see me, and was soon joined by Farj Ullah Khan, governor of Bam, and a smart officer of engineers. We liad a lively and pleasant meeting; and my satisfaction would have been complete but for the disappointment600 TELEGRAPH AND TEA VEL.

The sarhang I found a stout, cheery and good-looking young man of winning address. The Bampur chief was sturdy and thick-set, beyond middle age, with a round and not very expressive face, set off by a well- dyed beard ; and his Persian was hard to understand. The bustle and noise of camp were quite grateful in these parts; and the drums were especially welcome. Later in the day a message or two passed between Ibrahim Khan and myself about my proposed journey; and by his suggesting a direct move to Bandar Abbas, I inferred that he would have wished to dissuade me from prosecuting it. But my mind had been made up on the subject; and I saw no cause to retreat from my resolve. On the day following, the biave aim) marched out of Regan, and I w T as left to get through twenty-four hours in that very unattractive collocation of a hundred mud houses. My abode was within a large quadrilateral inclosure; and as if the outer wall were insufficient protection, Hasan must needs bolt me in at night. From Regan to Bampur, a distance roughly computed at 180 miles, we made out a nine days' journey exclusive of one halt. The first half to Khosrin led through aX1I --I THE BAMPUR PLAIN. G01 barren, dry tract, for the most part sand-hills of various shapes and sizes—some forming fantastic, unmistakable landmarks, some bearing names which served to distin guish normally dim localities. This region, however distasteful to the ordinary traveller, would be found an interesting field for geologists, from the western entrance of the rocks at the hot springs of Abigarm, to the south-easterly exit near the torrent of Khosrin • but its dreariness is indescribable ; and the heat in summer must be terrific. Yet here and there is pasture ; and water is, at certain seasons, abundant in the midst of this desolation. It was with a sensation of relief that we emerged from the hills upon the slopes which led to the vast Bampur plain. This tract was of a ' ' 1 ' t character to that we had passed through • but the rugged outlines of the scenery behind us remained long visible as we continued our easterly course In using the term ' Bampur plain,' I seek to express the whole high land bounded on the west by the desolation just described ; on the north by extensive desert as well as lull chains or detached irregular ranges, amid which the snow-covered Basman mountain rises in surpassing height and beauty ; south and east by a barrier of con tinuous rock, through which the passes into Makran and Ka at, respectively, are limited, by vulgar and perhaps truthful tradition, to seven in number. The character ol tins plain, more than 100 miles in length, is that of central fertility with a ring or belt of desert near the bordering lulls. Actually touching the hills again, there is, m some spots, a show of verdure. The grain and vegetable-yielding land is interspersed with trees, and these, though generally low, are not without a certain importance: notably the babul, tamarisk, and wildnt ' if n ■ «&gt; I- - r '] i i ^ li fcil v r ■ I | r (502 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

Our camping-ground, between Khosrin and Bampur, was at Laddi, Kalanzao, Chahi Shor, and Kuch Girdan; names which mark no precise locality, but signify that the wayfarer's great essential, water, is procurable. If one well be choked, there will doubtless be a second in the vicinity to supply its place. But an experienced guide is invaluable, because these wells are hard to find, even for the initiated, and shepherds and goatherds are not always on the spot. At Kuch Girdan there is the Bampur river. Our guide, Hashim Beg, though lie actually accompanied me further, had been ostensibly relieved at Bam by an artillery naih called by my face tious athlete, ' the voiceless.' He was truly a solemn and silent individual, who hovered about me phantom like at unexpected moments, and looked, as he rode along at my side, not unlike the CommcndcitoTe in Don Giovanni.' He again had been replaced at Regan by one Thamasp Kali, of aspect smart but sinister. A cast in the eye was perhaps, after all, the only true drawback to his good looks. He proved himself, at all events, a vigilant and intelligent cicerone; and though, availing himself of the occasion, he had agreed to escort some people and quadrupeds to Bampur on his own account, he did his duty to myself honestly and well. He wore a medal for gallantry in action with the Baluchis at Erofshan. Before reaching Bampur, my own two per sonal attendants had both shown signs of languor and despondency, especially Pahluwan Hassan, whose moicih was in truth far behind his 'physique. Neither of them was exactly comfortable on a camel, the animal selected for their conveyance in Baluchistan; but the athlete pridedUi XII.] KUCTI GIRD AN, 603 liimself in having achieved a superiority in this respect over his fellow-servant. One day on the march he seized the opportunity of Rahim's camel falling with its rider, to tell me a story to the poor man's prejudice, when just as he was reaching the climax, down came his own camel. His dismay and discomfiture were ludi crous. I never heard and never asked for the conclusion of his narrative. Ivuch Girdan, the last stage on the march from Narmashir to Bampur, is not exactly the place to choose for halting; but as at Regan, so here also, the step was a necessity. I reached this place on the afternoon of the 4th February, after a hot and weary march, during which I had walked some three or four miles, in con sideration of my steed's sore back, a contingency that had begun to assume grave proportions; and on the following morning, after a night al fresco, there I still was among the tamarisk bushes, not preparing a start, but awaiting camels which had failed to appear. Tha- masp Ktili had written to Ibrahim Khan to announce my approach, and intention to ride in to Bampur on that same afternoon ; adding an expression of hope on my part that he would dispatch me to the sea-coast as early as possible; and a return messenger had brought intelli gence of the safe arrival of all whom I had left at Re gan, with an intimation that I could come in as intended, or wait until the next morning. The state of affairs, however, decided me to adopt the latter course ; so 1 remained another day at Kuch Girdan, almost buried in the sand, which a strong and incessant east wind, ori ginating in a cold mist before dawn, cast over us from liillocks not many hundred yards away. The diminutive tent 1 had provided myself with came up, it is true, in * ,1^ • '604 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. the course of the evening ; but something more substantial was required for cleanliness, exclusive of convenience or comfort. The camels did not all arrive : one poor beast was reported to have died on the road ; and the drivers were out all night. On the morning of the 6th February we moved to Kasimabad, a small village of Baluchis, with a farm-fort, where the inhabitants, generally, looked poor and savage; the children being half naked, the men ill-clothed, and the women dirty and disheveled. The black complexions and ill-favoured countenances, together with the squalor and wretchedness everywhere apparent, gave me a pain ful impression of the population in these parts. African types I had already observed ; and their recurrence at Kasimabad led me to suppose that, irrespectively of the practice of keeping private slaves, a system of slave co lonizing had been pursued, and might be still in force in Persian Baluchistan. The hut in which I was installed was formed of tamarisk trunks and branches, a few sun- dried bricks, mud, and other odds and ends, procured from the jungle. Our entrance into Bampur was according to the ap proved Persian custom in such matters. I had been provided with a good riding camel in place of my sore- backed horse for the first part of the march ; and I sub sequently dismounted and exchanged the seat for one on a Persian charger, saddled and caparisoned in the native fashion. As we drew near, Suliman Khan, deputy- governor of Bampur, came out to meet me. Balucb cavaliers, paraded on the road-side, fell in with the re tinue. Persian horsemen, eager for display, started to the front, and skirmished, firing at full speed to their front, flanks and rear, with skill and effect; the varietyxii.] A GOVERNOR IN PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. 605 of colours and costumes observable in the mixed caval cade served to vivify and light up the picture. On ar rival, discarding ceremony, I went straight to the tent of the sarhang, and met with a warm and friendly re ception. Suliman Khan accompanied me, and Ibrahim Khan came in while we were conversing together. However true might be the rumours of his hostility and misdoings, I had no personal objection to the short, squat, bluff, plain-spoken Bampur chief; and preferred his open opposition, if such were purposed, to the sleek looks and expressions of the conventional Oriental host. To his objections to my move to the coast direct, or at Gwadar, I proposed that he should simply pass me to the limits of his own territory, where it touched that of Kalat, and I would get Fakir Muhammad, the local governor on the other side of the frontier, to escort me thence to the sea. Eventually, this project fell to the ground. He was not on good terms with the chief named, nor could he be answerable for me farther than Sarbaz. But Ibrahim Khan showed me, in his rough 7 O way, real civility. He promised to send me to Tenk, a small fishing village, whence a boat might be procured for passage to Maskat, or elsewhere. The sarhang took comparatively little part in the discussion ; but his behaviour would have done no discredit to the polished gentleman of Europe. The next morning the governor of Bampur and his deputy brought over my appointed guide, one Mashhadi Abbas, an old collector of revenue, whose Persian hulla and dyed beard were no doubt more familiar than pleasing objects to the Baluchis. To my surprise and satisfaction he agreed to take me at once to Charbar, and guaranteed that the journey should be performed in seven606 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. days. Our bargain was instantly struck, and in another twenty-four hours we were on the move again. Bampur, 1 at the period of my first visit was a village of some 400 habitations. That belonging to the governor best deserved the name of house. It was not only dis tinguished by size, but in the possession of a hadgir rising, tower-like, from the roof. The fort, visible for a considerable distance, from whatever side approached, had been built on a long, irregular mound, the higher or northern side of which supported the citadel, whence the walls had been carried down in a north to south direction. There were soldiers and guns inside ; but the sarhang s detachment was encamped on the plain below. My quarters were in a small house in a fine, large, walled- in garden of recent formation, possessing date-trees, the kunar and the sipastdn —close beside the tents, and within easy hearing of drum, bugle, and word of command. Had I myself been governor and detachment commandant, I could not have asked for better fare or better treatment than was freely bestowed upon me by the civil and military authorities ; the parting from whom was effected in the same cordial spirit as had rendered memorable our original meeting at Regan. And here let it be understood that the quid pro quo principle, prevailing all over the East and rampant in Persia, was not the motive for hospitality in the instance rendered. If presents were made at all, they were com paratively valueless. The sarhang positively, but in the most courteous manner, declined a souvenir from me representing any worth in money, but solicited m 1 Literally, ' Bahmanpur,' so called, if the late Wakil-ul-Mulk's authority be unassailed, from the son of Bahman, founder of Bahm, a monarch com monly identified with Artaxerxes Longimanus, but whom to fit into Karman history, we should rather seek to recognise in Ardashir Babagan.xii.j DEPARTURE FOR THE COAST. 607 lieu a pair of ordinary wire spectacles. If the friendli ness exhibited was not spontaneous, it must have been exercised in deference to the wishes of the Wakil-ul- Mulk, minister of Jvarman ; and even this view of the case is by no means barren of honour or credit to the Persian character. On the morning of the 8th February, I mounted my camel—for horses had been discarded—and turned my face to the coast. We were but a small party. I had the two Persians, now much subdued; while Abbas, the guide, was accompanied by two armed Baluch cavaliers, and an old man who stumped his way on foot. Revisiting Kasimabad, where we breakfasted, then turning to the south, we crossed a desert country, and, after about twenty-seven miles, dismounted near a well and sand-hills to rest and pass the night. On the next day we marched nearly the same distance to Maskotu, breakfasting on the way beside the huts of Lashari Baluchis, who supplied us with delicious mast (the Turkish yoghurt), fresh butter and dates. The country traversed was still desert, but the heavy sand gave place to harder ground as we neared the hills. Men, women, or children were seldom encountered. One woman was observed dyeing- clothes, the dye, almost black in colour, being made of the bark of the date-tree, mixed with clay and water. Maskotu we found to be a village of few inhabitants, shortly before visited by cholera, succeeding small-pox. It consisted of the usual huts and two castellated buildings in more or less preservation, and there were many date-palms there on the south bank of a large, hroad and dry river bed. Our third march was to Fanoch, about twenty-five miles ; over a road, hard or sandy, stony or gravelly, intersected with many beds of streams and608 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. small ravines, and passing, at intervals, among small black liillocks. In this village were grouped a large number of huts, and among them rose the customary- fort; there were numerous palms, and patches of cultiva tion—wheat, beans, and barley : but were it not for the pleasant contrast afforded by its life and colours to the surrounding monotonous waste, Fanoch would merit little notice from passing travellers. One of our Baluchis left us to-day, and T did not regret his departure, for he was grumbling and discontented. What I like in these men is their thorough nationality, and pride of nation ality. What I dislike, is the way they have of showing it. The chief of Fanoch, Chakar Khan, was absent when we were at his village ; but his son, a handsome and well-mannered little boy, came out and kissed my hand. I presented him with a kamarhand, or waist-cloth, which might, if necessary, serve the purpose of a turban. I was told there were about 100 houses at this place ; but could hardly believe it had 500 inhabitants. My old guide informed me he had five waives here, and five at Bampur. I must not forget the explanation which he gave to-day of some large, pale, circular patches, almost circles, standing out distinctly from the darker soil around them. They were the Payi-duldul-i-Ali,' the feet, or rather the prints of the feet of the mare of Ali, 1 so venerated by all Shias. That these marks may have been four feet in circumference or more, did not seem to necessitate objection on my part so much as the fact that they were in a single line and at uneven distances one from the other, and I therefore asked what had become of the second foot, hind or fore. The guide's answer was 1 ' Nomen muli albi qui Muhammedis erat,' is, on the other hand, Freytag s interpretation.xii -j locust-hunting. (m to the effect that his version of the legend was given as he had leceived it; hut he was not prepared to criticise or discuss its merits. Fiom hanoch, we pursued a zigzag course to the south for about sixteen miles, when our small party entered the tang, or pass—in the present instance, a very narrow and rough defile between steep rocky hills, links of the long Makran chain. This confined passage shortly widened to an open space, with a view of distant elevations: again did the route close in and expand as before. Leaving the village of Dehan to the left and Benth to the right, we halted a mile or two below the second. Of the one we saw nothing but date-palms ; of the other some few huts appeared among the trees. Abbas informed me that so severe had been a recent visitation of cholera, that Dehan had been almost depopulated, and if the 500 deaths reported at Benth were correctly es timated, there also much the same result must have been experienced. A fine old Baluch to whom I addressed myself said that the sickness had quite ceased. On the march to-day 1 witnessed an extraordinary scene. The Ikluchis of 1 anoch, of all ages and both sexes, were out in large numbers, locust-hunting; and the vigour with which the sport was carried an, was not more remarkable than the abundance of game at their disposal. As we lode among the scattered insect legions, it seemed as though each stroke of hand, cap, or kerchief, was a capture, and yet did not the swarms perceptibly diminish, rhe statement made to me at the time, that these locusts were boiled and salted for eating, does not in my opinion admit of the least doubt; and if any evidence were wanted in support of the literal meaning of the word in Suipture (St. Matthew iii. 4), the practice of Makran R IIG10 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chai-. Balucliis might be cited in addition to that ol the Arabs detailed by Hasselquist. The next day's march, our fifth from Bampur, was a stiff one to myself and servants ; how much more so to a stray follower or two who accompanied us a great part of the way on foot, and the camels 1 1 rose befoie thice a.m., and while looking about me, was asked the time by Abbas. Hearing my reply, he gave the signal to start. There were no tents to strike or bedsteads to pack ; and we moved in as light marching order as the prospective requirements of Indian Presidencies would permit; but it was about 3.40 when we broke ground. After nearly seven hours on camelback, we pulled up for a short hour, resuming work before 11.30. At 4 .40 we selected a resting-place for the night, and called it Guuz, the name of the district generally, as of the cape stretching from it seaward. Since our entry within the Makran barrier, and for more than twenty miles to-day, we had followed or guided ourselves by the bed of a ^ river called at its rise above Fanoch the ' Aimim,' and afterwards the Benth. To-day we had left it where its waters, joined by the tributary Nasferan, flow down to the sea under the name, first of Korandab, then of Kalig the fishing hamlet at its mouth : and our course lay m an easterly direction towards the Tenk river. After a surfeit of stones and hills, we debouched upon a plain, hard but sandy, with much low jungle and wild vege tation, the last similar to that of the Smd outlying wastes, which might be classified, for distinction, into products eaten and products rejected by camels. e had passed during the day a block of whitish stone scooped out at the top like an apothecary's mortar. This was explained to us to be a frequent resort o t iex' ] RAIN IN THE RUDKHANA. 611 Makranis, because the powder obtained there was an infallible remedy for toothache. I believed it in some way associated with other marvellous tokens of the presence of the Prophet's son-in-law, such as the Pir Ali, the cleft in which rock is attributed to a blow from his sword. Legends of Ali abound throughout Makran ; and the marks of his foot are pointed out, or tangible evidences of his physical prowess adduced, in all parts of the country. Amid a normal population of Suni Baluchis, the fact may be thought to tell of old Persian occupation ; but it is open to question whether the assumed associations are genuine, or imported by annexation of the last few years. Ihe morning after bivouac at Gunz, having re-rolled our bedding spread there on the sand, we started at four a. m.; and after fair camel-marching for about an hour and a half, lost our way in a kind of defile or deep bed of a torrent. \\ e had taken a low and narrow passage among rocks instead of an upper path unknown ; and had got so perplexed in the darkness, that we had to await the broader light of day. After resuming our march, we came upon a dowdra, or encampment of nomads, among whom our Persian guide had acquaint ances who helped to put us on the right road. We found the Tenk rudkhana very wide, and the water, as usual, confined to particular shallow channels, or a pool here and there. At nine a.m . I congratulated myself on getting clear of the river; but after a short progress to the east, we fell in with it again, and were detained between its high banks for long. Rain had set in before mid-day ; and up to nearly three p.m . we worked on under difficulties.

[chap. and struggled bravely on our behalf. A\ e made uu attempt to reach the Khaur-i-Kir, 1 which brings down the waters from Gaih, but failed ; for when we had come within five miles of its right bank, our course was impeded by a rapid stream which had suddenly risen into im portance, and forced its way violently through the yielding sand. So we encamped near some inhospitable rocks, awaiting a more favourable opportunity. The rain came down in torrents, and drenched us all. Hassan rigged up a temporary tent for me with an india-rubber covering; but, independently of holes filled with bits of stick or left open to chance, unless 1 could double up snail-like under its limited shelter, it was only available down to the waist. So I sat holding an umbrella, smoking, and spasmodically endeavouring to dry my inner garments at a poor fire, until a star ap peared, then another and another, and a break in the N.W. caused my spirits to rise with the conviction that a good time was at hand. 1 turned in and tried to sleep near some half-burning sticks, but woke at one a.m . cold and comfortless, and amused myself with the fire again, and so on until break of day. How to name our halting- place was difficult; but I jotted down ' East of Bir rocks,' and made the distance marched twenty-eight miles. In this day's march, one of those many instances of popular superstition peculiar to the Baluchis passed under my observation. We were passing the shrine of Shai, or Saiyid Harun in the bed of the Tenk river, and two Baluch guides had accompanied us from the dowdrci, i From Karachi westward, all along the Makran coast, and up to the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arah, the word Khaur is applied to the river mouth, or to that part of the river which is near, and receives the salt waters of the sea. I counted no less than twenty-seven of these creeks between Sonmiam and .Task.X11.J BALUCH SUPERSTITIONS, (J13 to point out a bye-path avoiding a deep water passage likely to cause detention. Suddenly the guides stopped their camels and dismounted. One took in his hand a biscuit, turned to the right, and reverently placed his offering on the ground; the other advanced a few paces in the same direction, and made a solemn bow. Closely watching the quarter indicated by these movements, I saw a tree which, though a tamarisk, looked Druidical and picturesque ; but Mashhadi Abbas assured me the real shrine was a well. He further informed me that no Baluch ever passed this place without laying there his offering, or would think of reclaiming any money or property accidentally dropped there : that if a traveller halting for the night burnt the wood and gave his cattle the fodder procurable on the spot, it would be well with liini ; but that if he took the wood to burn elsewhere, it would be impossible to light it; or if he cut or carried away the grass for consumption elsewhere, it would kill the animal it was intended to nourish. On the next day we succeeded only in reaching the Khaur-i-Kir. Nor did we accomplish this five miles without an intervening halt at a Baluch dowara. On arriving at the bank, we found the ground so soft and untenable for camels, and the current so strong, that we gave up all hope of immediate crossing, and put up where we were for the night, choosing the higher around ' o o o among tamarisk and hirir (wild caper) bushes. The next morning we passed over the stream, which had much decreased, and pushed on for eighteen miles to Khaur Sangam, which was crossed with comparative ease. Halting to breakfast and rest our camels on the left or further bank, we made a fresh start soon after mid-day. The country had been rendered somewhat(514 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

At sunset we reached a large salt-water khaur, and were in the close neighbourhood of the sea. 1 descried the smoke of a steamer in the bay of Charbar: but the village itself could not be reached until w T e had ascended and descended the intervening O hill of Tiz. We contrived to attain the top of tliis eminence ; but as it was too dark to discover the down ward path, we spread our bedding, as had now become a habit, under the open canopy of heaven. The ground was hard and interspersed with rock, and the dews tell heavily; but w r e could estimate our day's march at the respectable figure of forty-three miles, and the familiar sound of a ship's gun told us there were friends to meet in the morning. So the night was really a pleasant one. ihe descent was steep, but only three miles remained to Charbar; and we were not long in getting over these on the morning of the 16th February. Here we were met and welcomed by the Arab governor and his minister; by Lieutenant Stifle and Mr. Johnstone ; and last not least by my good friend Murdoch Smith, with whom I had thus again foregathered only two days later than the date anticipated in my official letter addressed to him on parting. He had made his way to Bandar Abbas by a mountainous route little frequented by modern travellers, but not w T holly unknown to a reading public, reaching the sea coast on the 3rd February, when I was yet two marches from Bampur. Here he w r as joined by Vice- Consul 'lohnstone, who had arrived, under instructions, from Basrah; and on the 7th ot the month both officers hadXII.] THE FANOCH PASS. 615 embarked on board the Ambertvitch, for disembarkation at Henjam, Masandam, and Jask respectively. From the last place tliey had proceeded by land for about sixty-seven miles to Sooruf, whence, taking to the steamer again, they had continued their route by sea to Charbar. It was the smoke of the Amberivitch bringing Major Smith and his companions into port which I had noticed on the previous evening. Most thankful was I that our plans had been blessed with successful execution: and that a kind Providence had preserved us to meet in health and safety through a rough and unusual journey. Setting aside all political considerations, and looking at Western Baluchistan as a region to be revisited, if only to compare its geographical and ethnological status with what it was in Pottinger's time more than half a century before, a journey such as I have imperfectly sketched could hardly be void of interest. And even had the travels of Pottinger and Grant been of sufficiently recent date to render superfluous any following in their foot steps, I believe myself correct in stating that no English, and very possibly no European traveller of whom any thing is known, had ever penetrated the Fanoch pass at all. As regards the question of personal risk, I am not prepared to say that there is none whatever, especially at times when resistance is exercised by petty chiefs against the local authorities; nor do I for a moment dispute the wisdom of proceeding with tact and caution on all occasions; but 1 can honestly assert that on no occasion was any molestation offered to myself, nor can I subscribe to the opinion of even so excellent an authority as the late Muhammad Ismail Khan, minister and governor of Karman, that either Persian or Baluch disguise was essential to the safe conduct of an English616 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. officer, as enjoined on me for the roads west and south of Bampur respectively. Of course, had I persisted in going by Gaih or Kasrkand, it is impossible to say what would have been the result; but the danger, to my mind, would rather have been from enforced association with Persians than the mere dress of the Faringi. My two attendants, moreover, were most conspicuous in their attire. Hassan the pahluwdn was in a loud and incon gruous mixture of green and brown ; and Rahim Beg had boots more becoming Dirk Hatteraik than a Persian 2&gt;ish- khidmat (valet). These men were not improved by their journey into Baluchistan. It was not judged advisable to encourage intercourse on their part with the natives: there was no necessity to employ them as caterers, for the guides were better fitted to the work ; nor did they seem to care to meddle with matters in which the way to mudctkhil was not clear. One, the man of physical strength, fell into despondency, and was perpetually groaning over the hiahan (desert), into which he had been led : the other seemed to have lost both coiniuou sense and energy.

On the fifth day after arrival we returned to Kalka and the hot plains, thankful for a kindly reception in every sense, and most promising, as regarded our official plans, on the pait of the highest authorities; bearing away, moreover, pleasant recollec tions of renewed intercourse with acquaintances, some of whom I had known as cadets when orderly officer at Addiscombe, and for one of whom, at least, I felt that, if life were spared, a career of useful distinction might bo safely predicted. Dak carriages and railway brought us through Ludhiana, Jalandar, Amritsar and Lahor to Multan, where we caught the river steamer on the 25th April. Both Amritsar and Lahor are well known to merit the traveller's attention. The Sikh temple, at the first, is one of those picturesque hijoux for which Indian scenery is noted. At the latter city, the courtesy of the Lieutenant-governor 1 provided us with ready means for inspection of the principal objects of intrust, and elephants were brought into requisition for the streets and public places. A passage up or down the Indus is a wearisome affair at almost any time, and we had the misfortune to get what is called ' snagged ' on the eighth day after embarkation. Whether river conservancy has effected 1 The late much-lamented and respected Sir Ponald MacLeod.XII.] THE SIMPLEST OVERLAND ROUTE. 019 or will effect a full remedy for this liiglily probable con tingency, is a question on which there may be conflicting opinions ; but the present age of Indian progress cannot dispense with those railway links still required to join Calcutta to Karachi. On the 5th May we reached Kotri, whence the railway soon carried us to the seaboard; and after five more days passed in the modern capital of Sind, we returned to Bombay. Before the close of May, Major Smith had returned to Persia, and I, having paid my respects at Mahableshwar, was on my homeward way in a steamer of the P. and 0. S. N. Company. Constant journeying of a different kind had made me look upon reaching the deck of these vessels as almost equivalent to arrival in England. It seemed as if all trouble and responsibility for the rest of the journey had at such time virtually ceased. The traveller—handed over to stewards, innkeepers, valets de jrtace, and the rest of that genus who, without any especial philanthropy or self-sacrifice, make administration to the wants of their fellows the business of their lives—has really no need of exercising his own independent judgment. To spare my readers, upon whom these travels must have already somewhat palled, I will not dwell on the land journey from Karachi to Charbar still wanting to complete a real overland route home, and performed by me in two separate sections. It shall be touched on with the brevity becoming the modicum of space assigned at the conclusion of a long story. In December 1861, under orders of Government, I moved, with an escort of Sind horse, from Karachi along the Makran coast, into the supposed land of the ancient fish and turtle-eaters {IxOvocfiayoi and ^eXc^o^ayot). During that seven weeks' march of 392 miles I had an(;oo TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. [chap. excellent opportunity not only of examining a little- known country, but of studying and forming acquaint ances with an interesting people. For, strange to say, notwithstanding proximity to Makran (rendered our immediate neighbourhood by the conquest of Sind), Englishmen as a rule neither cared to penetrate into that country, nor to know its history and politics. Of the few individual exceptions, the most notable, perhaps, was the late Mr. John MacLeod, collector of customs at Karachi, who proceeded by land to Gwadar as a simple traveller in 1853, and who collected much valuable information on the trade and inhabitants ot the coast. My object was to make arrangements with local chiefs for the protection of a contemplated line of telegraph ; and as the Khan of Kalat, who held suzerain authority in Eastern Makran, gave his countenance to the pro cedure by sending an agent to accompany me, the diffi culties in the way had been in some degree removed. The aspect of the country traversed was desolate, and the inhabitants were few. Yet were there gems of wild, romantic scenery to be discerned among the Hinglaj mountains, especially in the approach to the shrine of the Hindu pilgrims. Population was almost entirely concentrated, as a rule, in the fishing villages, such as Sonmiani, Ormara, Pasni, and Gwadar. r ihe nomads were found occasionally in small bodies, where there was cultivation, water or other life-sustaining attraction, and their presence was invariably signified by the use of the word ' halk' If this be, as I believe, the Arabic ' khalk,' the meaning is simply ' human creatures' a group or collection of human beings. Cultivation, however, except at the villages or in their immediate precincts, could hardly be said to exist. Fodder for cattleXII.] GWAJJAR.

AVater was upon the whole, sufficient for the wants of our party, and we numbered more than sixty, inclusive of Europeans. 1 (Iwadar was estimated by far the most populous of the fishing villages, and could boast of more than 1,000 houses, while Sonmiani and Ormara had barely a third of that number, and Pasni had not 100. The inhabi tants of Gwadar were mostly Mods, or boatmen and fishers : in a lesser ratio, Baluchis, Hindus, Khwojas, Arabs and slaves. Of these the Arabs formed the smallest, but at the same time the ruling section. Perhaps the governor and staff, with attendant soldiers, were the sole representatives of the race, inclusive, in some cases, of households. The slaves were proportion ally few, according to the statement given ; but the principle of slavery was fully acknowledged, and the slave possessor clung tenaciously to his privilege.

We made no show in cattle, retinue, numbers, or equipage; but the political agent, who did the catering, was able to supply tents and all requisite for our purpose. Our first march was a short one of twelve miles, of which ten were along a fine beach, the bottom of the west bay of Gwadar; our second led, from the creek by which we had encamped, over an undulating sandy tract, sparsely dotted with wild vegetation, for fourteen miles, to the Faleri Khaur, supposed to mark territorial boundary; our third, also fourteen miles, brought us through much the same description of country to a large river called the Dasht, where we halted a day for the transaction of business with the Baiuchis, who put in an appearance soon after our arrival. Their visit took us by surprise, from the manner in which it was effected. Suddenly the announcement was made that a cavalcade was ap proaching from the bank of the river opposite to that of our encampment. We went out to reconnoitre, and returned with the conviction that the new-comers were the chiefs of the district whom we had expected to see, and made preparation for their reception accordingly. Whether from the repeated matchlock-shots, or the time taken by the party in crossing the river, or the disturbed state of the neighbouring tracts, or other cause un known, we were unable to determine, but the rumour spread that the visitors were strangers and might have come with aggressive objects. Emerging from the tents a second time we witnessed a strange scene. The notionX1, -J ANTICIPATED RAID. ^ that a raid was imminent seemed to have possessed the natives in camp. Our party, all included, must have been under thirty; but the sensation was like that of a multitude. \\ omen and children, of whose existence we had not been aware, came rushing in we knew not whence, and buried themselves hurriedly in the near tamarisk bushes; tlocks appearing as if by magic, and stray cattle of kinds, were hurriedly driven in close beside our tents: men armed themselves and loaded theii hieaims. At least half an hour elapsed before it was certified that all was well, and that the looked-for chiefs were indeed the arrivals. When this result was generally apprehended, women, children, and quadrupeds i e-appeared from their hiding-places, and moved away cis puiposely though not as briskly as they had come in. Our fourth march was a short one of about eleven miles; hrst across the river, which was waded with some little difficulty, and afterwards over an open country much as before, but with a soil of a whitish hue, like hard, broken clay. As we had salt water at this last stage, it was a satisfaction to push on another twelve miles to Sikari, our fifth march. On the way we passed two white hillocks, the further and higher one being of graceful shape, like a miniature Demavend. These are classified in the language of the coast among the ' Daria Cham,' or mud volcanoes, and my inspection of the nearer one proved to my mind its affinity to those between Sonmi- ani and Ormara. 1 Our sixth march to Rodi, fifteen niiles, was for the most part over a plain with a white clay surface, sometimes smooth as ice, sometimes broken Lieut.

The vegetation was sparse but continuous, consisting cliiefiy of the wild caper and a succulent plant called ' lani,' much affected by camels. Near Eodi we discovered a Baluch settlement with Hocks and herds and cultivation. The milk and buttermilk here obtained were most acceptable. Leaving a conspicuous landmark, the Khaki Kuh, or 'earth hill,' to our right, we turned to some clay hills with sharp, angular tops, and came upon clusters of mat huts, by the occu pants of which we were visited. The women and children were black enough to be slaves. We made our seventh march, of fifteen miles, to Kachao, riding the first half through a vast mass of small white hills covering the wide space between Khaki Kuh and the sea. While we overlooked these singular excrescences at one time from a high pathway, at another we had to wend our way through a bed below. Tired of slow moving, Captain Ross and I galloped away independently of guides, and after a time emerged from the pale hillocks upon a bright yellow, sandy elevation, whence we got a fine view of the deep blue sea beneath. The contrast was charming, and I could not but feel that despised and avoided Makran had wonderful and varied*effects of light and shade, of sunrise and sunset, of hill and plain, or sea-shore, well worthy of record. Nothing in its way could well be finer than these yellow sands and this blue water. We had to turn inland again to find our en campment on a white hard plain, divided from the sea by a rugged hill range. Our eighth and last march brought us into Charbar. We were able to gallop the greater part of the first nine miles to Tizcopan: the valley bearing which name, with its grateful banian tree and abundant green grass, was a truly refreshing sight.time a long-entertained ambition to 'do' the full overland route from Karachi to the Caspian.

Then came eight hilly miles, for the march was seventeen and our 110 miles were completed. To Captain Ross the fact was comparatively unimportant. He had accom plished this little journey before. But for me it was otherwise. Jn carrying out on this occasion the wishes of Government, I was enabled to gratify at the same georgian minstrels, from a tiflis photograph.6 26 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL.

And the ])leasant but better-known European routes leading to and from Constantinople, and particularly those including Vienna and the Danube, had reverted to my mind as affording, possibly, fit material for its lighter pages. But it seems to me that enough has already been recorded to tax the reader's patience, and that the publication of these further notes, if needed at all, may well await a fitter season. In the meanwhile, I take the opportunity of putting in a word of strong recommendation for the costume photographs of our countryman, Mr. Westly, at Tiflis ; of advising any amateur traveller proceeding from Tehran to the Turco-Persian frontier near Karmanshah to visit the rock inscriptions at Besitun ; and of placing a passing personal memorial, as it were, on the tomb of an old, faithful, and stout-hearted Tabriz! servant, whom I lost from sunstroke, haply combined with less im mediate causes, at a caravanserai within twenty miles of Baghdad, just as we had completed a hot and hard ride from the Persian capital. Nor can 1 miss the occasion of thanking most warmly the many kind hosts who helped me on this latest -men tioned as on other sections of my travels. Some have gone to the pilgrim's common bourn. Of these last, the name of one reverts instantly to mind, who, whether dis charging his official duties in Northern Persia or on the shores of the Black Sea, could shed the light ot his modest labours even upon Western Europe, and make his allotted corner, however remote, a centre of genera and extensive usefulness.

It may be thought that too much has been told of the difficulties in establishing an extraordinary line of land telegraph, and not enough of the friendly action of those through whose territories it runs. Such has been far from the writer's intention. He readily acknowledges the goodwill and co-operation without which the wires at this moment and daily conveying Anglo-Indian messages to and fro could assuredly have had no existence.

R eaders of the memoir will kindly bear in mind that in sketching out a real character it has not been intended to place on record simply its most attractive points. In like manner, if running a mile in six minutes be held of no account when public schoolboys commonly do it in five; or if the incident of the bears (page 28) be thought trivial by experienced sportsmen, and indicative of rashness hy the uninitiated, allowance will doubtless be made for the produc tion of a faithful portrait. The fullowing letter addressed by the late Dr. Livingstone to Mr. MacLeod Stewart, Colonel Patrick Stewart's brother, cannot fail to he read with interest. Its receipt while this volume was in the press will explain why it is found in the Appendix :— ' N kwstfad A bbey, M ansfikld, N otts, Wth February, 1865, M y D ear S tewart, ' It is with no feigned words I say that I was deeply moved ^ hen I read the sad news of your dear brother's death.

' We once conversed on the subject of the possibility of spirits returning to their former haunts, and I in joke said, ' Well, if they do come, they may be expected to speak good English,' This was in reference to the spirit-rapping nonsense. He replied that he often thought deeply on that subject, and seriously too on the possibility of friends returning, as the idea is expressed in the ' May Queen,' in Tennyson, which you will remember: ' I shall listen what you say, When you think I'm far away.' 1 I enjoyed his company vastly and parted at Cairo. He wished me to stop a week, and we were to meet in Galloway. ... You must please excuse this effusion. It springs from the heart of your sympathising friend. (Signed) ' David Livingstone.' CHAPTER II. Last lines of page 84. In an interesting series of articles on the Province of Kurdistan, published in the Levant Herald, the following passage attracted my attention when at Constantinople :— ' poles and rafters. ' A large portion of the export of these articles takes place from the Diarbekir sanjak, but three times its amount and value is exported from the northern districts of the Saert sanjak to Mosul and Baghdad by the Bohtan-Su and its head waters, which irrigate large plantations of the poplar used for building purposes. They are divided for sale into three kinds, called ' Qudr,' ' Mirdirjak,' and ' Shugel,' which vary in thickness and length, the first being one foot in diameter, and about fourteen feet long, the second six inches and less in diameter, and ten feet long, and the third thin pieces used for filling in the roofs of houses and rooms. At the place of their growth the two first are sold respectively for thirty piastres (5s. 5^.) and four piastres i^d.) each, and the latter for one piastre {2d.) for fifteen pieces. The first pays a duty at Mosul of five piastres (lO^d) on each stick, and the 1 'New Year's Eve,' 10th Stanza : 'Though I cannot speak a word, I shall hearken what you say, And be often, often with you when you think I'm far away.'APPENDIX. 631 other two 10 per cent, in kind. The people engaged in this traffic are mostly from Mosul, and—though in a small way—like the lumber trade in Canada, experience and skill are required to evade accident, and to lioat these timbers through the intricate, rapid and confined streams of the tributaries that lead into the Bohtan-Su and ligris. Once arrived at the latter river, all the pieces are collected and joined into a raft, which then pursues its downward course without any more difficulty or detention.' Ihe native terms have been rendered in the newspaper etymology. ' Qudr' is probably the Arabic word ' Kadr,' signifying power or quantity. Ihe 'jak' in the next word may be used to show a sub stance of lesser degree; and ' Shugel' is doubtless the Turkish- Arabic word ' Shikalu,' meaning split or cleft. An additional extract from the same authority should have sufficient value to warrant insertion. We must premise that it is dated some few years ago:— n i r 14 'internal trade of the province. ' The whole value of the trade confined to the pashalik itself is, approximately, about £300,000 sterling, based principally upon the money value of the vegetable yield of the province. For as it must alvvays happen in these countries, where the price of grain, no matti-r the amount of the yield, is yearly subject, owing to the destitution and encumbered position of the raisers, to fluctuations varying from 50 to 100 per cent, at stated periods, the principal domestic trade will be in those articles of universal consumption offering such fixed and solid profits to the capitalist; here then, too, as elsewhere, the chief branch of that trade is in cereals, or money advanced on crops, absorbing a sum of £250,000. Money so advanced is either the property of capitalists, or men of small means, who run the risk so as to ensure their supply of grain for the year at moderate prices. In forming the estimate of this trade I have taken into consideration the totals of the animal and vegetable produce of this pashalik, and deducted from each item the money value of the amount actually exported (&lt;£179,800), and that consumed by the peasant and producer amounting to £338,400. A sum of £50,000 is employed in loans at interest, and in the petty transactions and trades incidental to an eastern province. Excepting the manufactures—silks, cottons, and leathers, and shallee, to be mentioned further on—already noticed, none of them is important or interesting enough to call for any special notice. The transit trade of Diarbekir consisting of British goods, fancy foreign goods from Constantinople, cotton goods from Erzeroom, and British manufactures, colonials, and French and Swiss goods from Aleppo, for Baghdad, amounts to £200,000 ; but beyond some trifling commission, it does not benefit the commerce of this 'f •632 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. place, although giving good employment to the people engaged in the raft business and to local muleteers. ' In spring a raft takes five days between Diarbekir and Mosul, and from fifteen to twenty-five in autumn. Each one carries fifteen cantars of goods, and is composed of 150 skins at five piastres (lO^tZ.) each. Small wood for the flooring, and six light poles for the frame work cost 80 piastres {14s. Gd.), and the wages of the man conduct ing it another GO, making a total of 840 1 piastres—equal to 71.12s. 8(Z. But as the skins are serviceable for several trips, and the wood is saleable at Mosul, the real cost of a raft, to the trade, is really very trifling. It is a strict monopoly, the exclusive right of making and working them being annually sold by government for about 100/. On an average, 300 of these kelleh (rafts) go to Jazireh, GOO to Mosul, and 200 to Baghdad, annually, from Diarbekir.' CHAPTEE nr. concluding extracts from the 'times,' p. 128. The question of difficulty in telegraphing through an unbroken - circuit of 1,200 miles has long since been set at rest by successful working through much longer distances. And arguments used in October, 18G3, for laying cables in short sections were found not only obsolete in 1873, but they had actually become so in 18GG, or in less than three years after they were promulgated. Well might Colonel George Chesney say, in reference to our imitative rather than original military organizations, that in most matters, ' England led the way. Witness our aptitude for commerce and colonisation, our railway?, telegraphs, and manufactures.' 2 As regards telegraphs, the progress of late years has indeed been marvellous. How little could those of our countrymen, who wondered at Edgeworth's mechanical ingenuity displayed about the dawn of the present century, in imparting distant intelligence, have foreseen the telegraphic feats of the days in which we live. Lord March once expressed his regret to Sir Francis Delaval that he could not hear the result of the Newmarket racing of the day until about nine in the evening. The latter offered to bet £~&gt;00 that Edge- worth would obtain it for him by five in the afternoon. He had a system on which he could quite rely.

(533 Street were successfully connected by his method ; but, we are told, 'it was too expensive for common use.' 1 THE ARABS AT MASANDAM, p. 142. Patrick Stewart thus wrote from Maskat on the 23rd February, 1864, to Sir Bartle Frere, then Governor of Bombay : I am very anxious indeed to give a corrected account of all that has taken place since we had the great batisfaction of anchoring the cable ship in the magnificent landdocked harbour at the head of Malcolm's inlet. But 1 fear this is no very easy task, especially as I am still scarcely fit for work, though very much better than when I last wrote. 'In the first place I must explain that, from the state of the weather at the time we first approached the Arabian shore, we were obliged, as a precaution, to retain the Victoria till the cable-ship had anchored, and we were therefore unable to send down for Colonel Disbrowe so soon as I had wished. ' It was not till the ni^ht ot the 14th that he arrived, and althomdi his presence would have been very valuable to us in the earlier period of our stay, he had no means whatever of joining us till he did. On his arrival he aided us in every way in his power, and has continued to do so ever since, making over for our use his own tents aud a portion of the material intended for his own residence. ' I should also mention that it was not till the 12th that Colonel Golds mid and Mr. Walton overtook us in the gun-boat, which had remained atGwadar to bring on the staff and apparatus required there during the preliminary tests. 44 As regards our actual experience at the new station, and the important subject of its security, I wish to say that (though I hope and trust I shall never become an alarmist) I tbink it would be wrong in me to abstain from expressing my opinion. ' For the first week after our arrival I was almost constantly on shore, striving with more or less success to conciliate the people who came to us, and to induce them to assist us, and during this time I could not but notice many little incidents calculated to cause uneasiness, tor the first day or two all seemed to go well. It is true that exces sively little work was done, but as yet there was nothing to make us suppose that the Arab inhabitants were other than the miserably poor, inolfensive race they had been represented. Gradually, how ever, things changed. Shaikhs and their followers came crowding in from neighbouring villages, each more impudently importunate for presents than his predecessor. While almost demanding these, they would occasionally make the pretence of offering to help us with 1 1 Kxtracts from Edgeworth's ' Memoirs of Himself,' in Annual Register,634 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. workmen. But, when questioned as to terms, the most unheard of claims would follow : sometimes as much as ten rupees per man for a day's.work that was to cease at 2 p.m . ! On one occasion, men who had consented to undertake something for us at a moderate rate were attacked in rather a savage manner by those of another village. On this a strangely exciting scene arose : every man arming himself with a tent-peg, or anything else that came to hand, and joining in the melee, con amore. Goldsmid and I were alone and unarmed in the centre of them, and, for a few moments, the affair looked really awkward, though it was eventually settled hy the Arabs themselves, no one molesting us in the slightest degree. At this time our temporary office was still on board ship, and we were only endeavour ing to prepare for the reception of the people on shore. « Before we had long been thus employed we became aware of a regular system of scarcely concealed pilfering which threatened to become a really serious annoyance. Beyond expostulating with the shaikhs, who (though themselves the worst of all) had promised to prevent all this, we could do nothing without risk of widening the breach it was our great object to close. Altogether, at the time I speak of, our dealings with the Arabs were far from satisfactory. I believe these extraordinary inland lakes were at one time almost the head quarters of the Gulf pirates, and I have no doubt that many of our friends at Maklab (the isthmus), if they do not now practise it, would gladly take to the trade again if opportunity offered. They are false, cunning, and greedy to a degree ; under no sort of authority, and strangely ignorant of English power. In fact, from all I have seen, I am most strongly of opinion that it would be most imprudent to leave our station (whether while temporarily located at Maklab, or when removed to Khasab on a more permanent footing,) without the protection of such an armed vessel as will, by her mere presence, overawe the Arabs, and deter them from mischief. I do not know which of the vessels of the Royal Navy might best be spared, or whether your Excellency will think it advisable to send any one of them, but I really believe that it will be true economy to act as I venture to suggest, and I am very glad I am enabled to say that Colonel Goldsmid entirely concurs in this opinion. Colonel Disbrowe has, I know, written officially on the same subject. ' When obliged to send the gun-boat to Khasab for water or for other purposes, I was often reminded of the old puzzle of the fox, goose, and corn, in trying to arrange that the camp should not be lett unguarded. ' I am sure Disbrowe was wise in not landing the Imam's guards at our temporary station. We could not have done this without serious risk of provoking a collision ; and it was, I think, much more prudent to employ them (as we have done) in guarding the building materials and stores at Khasab. ' As a proof that these Arabs can go beyond the limits of such ignorant mischief as we complain of, I may mention a fact (of whichAPPENDIX. 035 Disbrowe is preparing an official account), viz., that the village from which we must look for our main supply of water at present, was burnt to the ground and nine of the people murdered a very few weeks a^o by those of another village lying on the opposite side of our camp. ' As my latest telegrams from our new station must have led your Excellency to expect to hear of me next from the head of the Gulf the^fact of this letter being written from Maskat must require explana- ' Knowing how much must be pre-arranged at Bushahr and Fao if our English employes are to be properly housed and cared for before next hot weather, I was most anxious to go on to those places at this time. Lut although the state of things at our new station began to improve very much about the time Colonel Disbrowe arrived, and are now I hope, in a still more satisfactory condition, I do not think I won d have been justified in withdrawing a steamer, and in leavin' the neighbourhood of Masandam for more than a very few days, unless our relations with the Arabs had been on a much better footing than they BTG. 'i ^J &gt;&gt;y T com ^ I1 » ^ as ^at to meet the mail steamer on her way up the Gulf, I was enabled to receive letters from, and to write to, Bushahr Basrah, and Baghdad; also to obtain materials and supplies we stand in need of lor the station : while Colonel Disbrowe has succeeded in transacting some important business with the Imam, and is now ready to return for a prolonged stay at the station. Colonel Goldsmid and Mr. \\ alton remained behind, with the gun-boat on one side of the isthmus, and the Victoria on the other. Our people are all under shelter ; and matters, when we left, were looking much more promising than they had done for some time before, ' We shall return at once to the spot, and I shall be able to report by telegraph if anything important occurs. If all goes well we shall open the station at Bushahr about 15th March and at lao ten days later. '1 have written to Captain Young explaining what we most require in the way of assistance from him. Pray forgive my writing to yourself demi-officially on the subject o our difficulties. I thought it was in some respects better to do so, as the political part of the work is not properly mine,' colonel stewart's repout op hth june, 1864, to bombay government, p. 169, As there are so many names mentioned in the paragraph immediately following that last quoted in this page, after-consideration has led me to insert it in the Appendix: 'In thus attempting to give a general description of the operations in the neighbourhood of Fao, T feel that I have not sufficiently r ■ i f iti 1 k ATELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. explained either the nature or extent of the difficulties that were experienced, nor done justice to the energy and courage of the officers and men who volunteered for and successfully completed the work. 1 consider it would have been simply impossible to ensure success had it not been that English gentlemen were found willing to toil on cheer fully day after day, in sun and mud, everywhere setting an example that excited even the apathetic Arabs to enthusiasm. In landing the end of the cable from boats on the 5th April, Sir Charles Bright and Messrs. Laws, Webb, Lambert, Woods, and Alexander (members of his staff), effected what was perhaps the most difficult individual operation of the whole, involving, from the nature of the ground to be traversed, not merely hardships and exposure, but direct and not inconsiderable danger. In this work, Colonel Goldsmid and Captain Bradshaw also took part, and on them, more, perhaps, than any others, fell the burden of continued labour and exposure during the whole of the protracted operations at iao. Working parties of oOicers and men from the Coromandel were also constantly employed ; and it gives me great pleasure to record the obligations I am under to Captain Carew for the cordial assistance which, though always rendered, was never more prized than on the occasions I now refer to. I have already spoken of the manner in which the river steamer CoTnet was employed, but not of the very valuable assistance received from Captain Bewsher, both in his own vessel and on shore ; and I hope I may be allowed to take this opportunity of recording Ids services as well as those of the Government Telegraph Staff (Mr. Brasher's especially, and Messrs. Kersting, Gregory, Patten, and Good- burn), who volunteered for duty on shore.' CHAPTER IV. KUM AND KASHAN, p. 199. H erbert's description of these places is very quaint and worth extracting :— ' Coom is a Citie placed in the halfe way betwixt the two Royall Cities Cazheen and Spaivhaivn, it is scituate in a faire and sensible Horizon, and in Front of both Kingdomes, j\Fedia and Varthia.

Khoi, near which the battle was fought between the Sufi king Ismail and the Sultan Selim I., must be some 600 miles, as the crow flies, from Kum ; and much further still by any routes through which troops could pass. Xor am I aware that there is extant any authority in support ot the statement that the conflict ' ended here.' Professor Creasy, in his history of the Ottoman Turks (vol. i. p. 224-5) says the victory was complete, and that Selim, putting the male adult prisoners to death, marched upon Tabriz, then the Shah's capital. He levied, moreover, on the conquered city, a contribution of a thou sand artizans, transferring them to Constantinople. The struggle took place, it is believed, as stated by Malcolm, ' on the frontiers of Azarbaijan,' or in that vicinity ; but the scene was, in all probability, west of Tabriz. Of Kashan, we are told that it is ' a famous citie in Parthia, whose metropolis is Spawhawn, whence she is distant sixtie miles and odde.' He continues:— ' 1 he antiquitie of it is not much, in this name, either taking beginning from Cazan Mirzey, sonnc to Hocem, or from Gassan, who in the yeare 1202 was utterly ruined by the Great Cham, the ruleTELEGRAPIJ AND TRAVEL. being kept but three Descents from his Grandsire Tangrolipix and his father Axan; or from Cushan, which in the Syriacke, is heate or blacknesse; but most likely from Vsan-Caslian, Anno 1470, who from his Armenian rule, vanquishing Malaoncres, the last of Tamher- lains progeny in this Countrey, got the Crowne of Persia, whose issue from Hismael sway now that Sceptre, of which alteration this Citie and Coom are joyfull, in reuenge of that terrible and violent destruc tion Tamherlaine made in his Expedition against Baiazet, Anno Domini 1397, whom he brought away imprisoned in an Iron Cage, having over- throwne him in that place where Pompey the Great ouercame Methry- dates King of Pontus, at mount Stella : this Tamherlaine was sonne of Ogg, sonne of Sagathai, and got the Crowne by marriage of Gyno Chans (Daughter and Heire) sonne of Barr Chan, sonne of Ilocuchan, sonne of Cyngis-chan, who Anno Domini 1162, subdued vn-chan, the last of the kings of Tenduck. These two Cities aboue others parched in his fiery anger.

Major John Underwood Bateman Champain, Royal Engineers (Lengal), was appointed to the distinguished corps of which he is a member in June 1853. Less than four years from that date the Indian Mutiny had broken out; and his services in the cause of its suppression and restoration of order are such as to warrant detailed narration. Early on the 12th May, 1857, a sowar rode into Jiurki bringing the ne\\s of the outbreak at Meerut. Captain Eraser, commanding the Sappers and Miners there, that very day marched his regiment to the scene of disturbance; and Lieutenant Champain, then acting for Lieutenant Chesney as Assistant Principal of the Thomason College, with his Principal's approval, volunteered, and was permitted to accompany. On the 16th May, at Meerut, a large proportion of these very Sappers mutinied, and Captain Eraser was shot dead at his own encampment. Champain assisted in carrying him to hospital, and the next day was appointed adjutant of the corps, vice Lieutenant Mannsell, who assumed command. Most of the men present in the lines when the mutiny took place ran off to Delhi; but from working parties absent at the time, and a few individuals who remained faithful in the midst of temptation, a body of some 300 sepoys was formed, w hich nucleus was afterwards reinforced from Purki. The carbines of these men were taken from them ; but when ten days afterwards General Wilson determined to march on Delhi, the native sappers wore le-armed, and Lieutenant Champain testifies that during his adjutancy their conduct was most exemplary, nor was there one deserter among them throughout the campaign. Lieutenant Champain was present at both actions on the Hindun river under General Wilson, and at Badli ke Sarai and-the capture of the heights before Delhi under General Barnard. Regimental adjutant during the whole siege, he took also the duties of field and assistant- Held engineer, not having had probably, for three months, one whole night in bed. lie was specially thanked in orders by General Bar nard for rapidly constructing an urgently required battery, afterwards designated ' ChampainV by written instructions of Colonel Baird ►Smith. ^Sfcver absent for one hour from duty through sickness or any other cause, he was employed either to superintend or assist in(140 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. the construction of, without exception, every single battery thrown up during the whole siege. On the 13th September he was wounded, but while on the sick-list, owing to the number of engineer officers incapacitated, he volunteered for duty and was present at the capture of the Palace. Lieutenant Mannsell's wounds having necessitated his departure to the hills, Lieutenant Champain succeeded to the command of the Sappers, and was in that position on the march to Agra and seven or eight minor expeditions in the vicinity, including the capture of Fathpur Sikri. He further commanded a small force of nearly 2,000 men, including Sappers, 21st Panjab Infantry, two guns, and a detachment of Ilodson's Horse and 9th Lancers, on the march from Agra to Fathgarh, where he joined the Commander-in-Chief in November or December 1857. He continued to command the Sappers, numbering some 500, on the march to Cawnpore and the Alambagh, returning to his post of adjutant on the return of Lieu tenant Mannsell in March 1858. He was present at the final capture of Lucknow, twice acting as Sir Pobert Napier's orderly officer, with Lieutenant Elliot Brownlow who was killed when associated with him in this duty. Major Champain was thanked specially in orders by Sir Eobert Napier for having, with Captain Medley and 100 sappers, held for a night the Shah Najif, an advanced post of great strength, abandoned by eight companies of the 53rd on account of its remoteness from the army. Assisting to prepare the plan of the siege for submission to the Commander-in-Chief, he was ordered by Sir Colin Campbell, after the capture of Lucknow, to erect fortified posts for outlying detach ments of police and regular infantry. Of these he completed about twenty. He was present at fourteen or fifteen minor engagements under Colonel Walter and others, and was thanked in a despatch by Captain MacMullin for services rendered in a rather severe affair near Balia. He was the only engineer officer employed at the capture of Jagdispur, where probably more than 10,000 troops were engaged under Sir John Douglas; and he was particiilarly recommended by that officer in his final despatch. He joined in pursuit of the rebels to the Kaimur hills, and when matters looked more quiet, he was appointed Executive Engineer of Gondah Hence he was trans ferred to Lucknow, of which station he was Executive Engineer till ordered to Persia with Major Patrick Stewart in 1862.He is now Chief Director of the Government Indo-European Telegraph, a department in whieh he has done continuous -ood service in Europe and Asia for some fourteen years. 2 Major Robert Murdoch Smith, of the Royal Engineers, a first lieutenant of September 1855, and second captain of June 18G4, had been employed, before joining the Persian telegraph in 1863 in conducting excavations and researches at Halicarnassus and on the African coast; and is joint author, with Captain Porcher, R.N of an interesting and admirably-illustrated volume on Cyrene. He is now director of the Indo-European telegraph in Persia, having succeeded Major Champam in the appointment more than nine years a'o 3. Major Oliver B. St. John, of the Royal Engineers (Bengal), is an oflicer of seventeen years' service. After employment for more than four years in the Public Works Department, in the north-west pro vinces of India, he volunteered and was chosen for service in Persia On arrival at Bushahr in January 1864, he took charge of the fifth and last of the telegraph divisions, considered by Colonel Stewart the most important and difficult of all. From December 1865 till June 1866 he had charge of the Director's office, and from March 1866 till January 1867 his own immediate superintendence extended over the whole line from Tehran to Bushahr. During this period the second wire was erected. Proceeding home in May 1867, he was thecce despatched to Abyssinia to take charge of the field telegraph and army signals, organised for service during the war. The telefn-aph was carried 200 miles from the coast under great difficulties; Lieut, a John was mentioned in Lord Napier's despatches, received the thanks of the Government of India, and was further recommended to the Commander-in-Chief for a brevet majority on attaining rank of captain. At the close of 1868 he returned to Persia^ where he remained for three years, rendering services to which t e Chief Director attributed much of the success attending the Iksso-Persian line of telegraph. In October 1871, Captain St. John was ordered to Baluchistan, with local rank of major, to complete the survey of the Perso-Kalat frontier, as provided for under Sir F. Gold- snud s settlement. He returned to England on completion of this work in October 1872, since which he has been employed in the India &lt;'lfice preparing maps of Persia and the Baluchistan frontier. The former will be based on longitudes of the principal Persian telegraph stations fixed by Major St. John in co-operation with Colonel Walker&gt; .1- } V J* ^ j' * 042 TELEGRAFH A ND TRAVEL. of the Indian Trigonometrical Survey, Captain Pierson, RE., and Lieutenant Stiffe, I.N., by whom time signals were exchanged between Greenwich and Karachi on the one hand, and the stations in Persia on the other. 4, Captain William Henry Pierson, of the Royal Engineers (Bengal), is an officer of more than fifteen years' service. He served with the field force under Lieutenant-Colonel Gawler in Sikkim, as assistant held engineer, from 24th January to 20th April, 18G1 ; was men tioned on that occasion in despatches, and received the thanks of the Government of India, Employed in India under the Public Works Department and as assistant to Chief Engineer of Oudh up to Sep tern her 1863, at which date he was transferred to Persia to assist in the construction of the telegraph. Services placed at disposal of Lords Commissioners of H.M. Treasury to superintend building of British Legation in Tehran ; and so detached from telegraph duty from May 1864 to October 1871. Acted as director, Persian telegraph, from 10th October, 1871, to 4th October, 1873. 5. Captain (Local Major) Beresford Lovett, C.S.I., is a second lieu tenant of June, and first lieutenant of lioyal Engineers (Bengal), of August 1858. He had rendered good service on the north-west frontier of India, when appointed to Persia for the telegraph in 1866. After arrival' in that country, he officiated, from January 1867 to October 1868, in the room of absent superintendents, and was favourably noticed for the part he took in bringing about the settlement of a serious disturbance which had occurred at the Abadeh station in June 1870. A very large number of men had been collected on that occa sion to threaten the telegraph office, their leader's object being to visit his wrath upon a fellow-countryman, one of the line guards em ployed by the British officers. Acts of aggression and gross violation of duty and propriety had followed, contrary to the spirit of the Anglo- Persian convention; and Lovett was despatched to investigate matters on the spot. Aidei by the chief local authorities, and acting with judgment and energy, he was able to fulfil his mission success fully ; and it was one which illustrated, in a remarkable manner, the peculiar position of British telegraph-signallers in Persia, and what semi-magisterial duties had to be discharged by the superintendents. In the same year, Captain Lovett was appointed engineer officer to the Perso-Makran and Perso-Afghan Boundary Commission; on com pletion of which duty, and return to England, he has been employedPFEND1X. 643 in the n.ap department of the India Office, turning to practical account the geographical information acquired in his recent surveys. G. Mr. Henry Valentine Walton was appointed Inspector in the I ndian Telegraph Department on 17 th December, 1856. Proceeded at once to India, where he served with zeal and efficiency during the Mutiny as a volunteer at Agra. He was also present at, and took part in, the battle at Neemuch, for which services he received the Mutiny medal. This gentleman subsequently joined the Telegraph Department in Persia, and was one of the first superintendents on the lines under construction in 1863-G4. He remained in this appointment until his death at Shiraz in May 1871. Mr. Walton's zeal and ability had been long recognized in the Persian telegraph, to the success of which he had contributed by hard and unusual services. And he held certificates giving testimony to the fulfilment of prior special duties, such as do not fall to the lot of Indian employes in ordinary times! He had saved his instruments at the critical period of the Mutiny ; and had suffered exposure, want, and sickness, in the capacity of st,r 0 e a nt of the Agra Militia, and one or the other in some degree when in charge of the Port Electrical Telegraph Office. It is not unworthy of remark that Major Champain and Captain Tierson were highly distinguished cadets at the Military College, Addiscombe. The first came out at the head of his term, a position he had maintained uninterruptedly from the day of entrance. The second came out first in three terms, four being the usual number. Both were Cheltenham boys. CHAPTER V. CHIEF DIREOTOIi 's REPORTS OF PROCEEDINGS, p. 293. Iiie reports referred to are those made at uncertain intervals to the Government of Bombay, which for some years exercised imme diate control over the Indo-European telegraph. One dated Tehran, 4th Xovember, I8G5, was reprinted by order of Parliament, and will be found (p. 436 to 4-42) in the Appendix to the report on East India Communications, dated 20th July, 186G. From the other, bearing date Pun ah, 22nd June, 1867, the following are full extracts ' I take advantage of the present occasion of my return to Bombay, to submit for the information of Government a brief report in con- X T 2Gi4 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. tinuatiou of No, 90 of 4th November, 1SG5, showing how far the proposals made nearly twenty months ago for the better conduct of the Indo-European telegraph have been carried out or otherwise, and to what extent the views then expressed have been confirmed, or anticipations realized. ' 2. There can be but little question that the Turkish line has im proved, and will continue to improve. Reference to the daily press will suffice to show that messages come and go through Constantinople with a regularity of speed hitherto unknown ; and I have reason to believe that the just complaints on the score of unintelligibility are becoming less numerous and important. The anticipation in my former report of messages passing ' to and fro between London and Karachi in 5^ hours' has been already so far realised that Mr. Walton's statement of tho 31st ultimo shows Gh. 24m. as the minimum time of transit in May 1866, 3h. 13m. in July, and 3h. 54m. in October. Allowance must be made this year for extraordinary inun dations in Turkish Arabia. ' 3. But by the ' Turkish line,' it must not be understood that the whole link between London and Fao is supplied, or that a message reaching Constantinople from India can necessarily find its way thence in a few minutes, or even hours, to the west of Europe. Last autumn especially the detention of telegrams at Constantinople before one of the European lines could receive them, had become notorious; and the causes to which this discouraging circumstance was traced were productive of similar delay with regard to messages passing eastward to the Turkish capital. ' 4. In giving attention, therefore, to the perfection of the Turkish- Asiatic correspondence, it has also been essential to bear in mind that this section has proved by no means the least efficacious on the whole Indo-European line ; and the Continental war of the past year has afforded additional proof of the necessity of having more than one independent wire through Europe which can be depended on for the transmission of Indian telegrams. ' 5. 1 am of opinion that, as a general basis of security, we should rely on not less than two routes between England, or Western Europe, and Constantinople. Present experience points for this purpose to the one through Paris, Easle and Vienna, found the best available during the war; and another through Italy and the Adriatic cable, vid Yalona and Salonica. The Eusso-Prussian route, leading to Persia, should, no doubt, be the general alternative; to be used at the discre tion of the public^ either on the ground of efficient working or economy or in the event of interruption on what may perhaps be appropriately termed the main line. ' 6. And in this view I may state that considerable progress has already been made. Under the authority of the Right Hon. the Secretary of State for India (Viscount Cranborne), I have been enabled during the past year to confer officially, on the matter of East India telegraph communications, with the chief directors of theA PPENDIX. 645 telegraph both in Paris and Vienna; and Major Champain has been employed on like missions at Berlin and St. Petersburg. The result of these semi-diplomatic discussions has been in every way successful LcL tT ^ ^diness of foreign government to LS intd vancing telegraphic communication with Asia, as a mere question of benefit and progress. It has also produced more substantial fruit Our commissioner at Constantinople, Mr. Courtenay, has just reported the satisfactory information that the Foreign Office had authorized Lord Lyons to accept two special direct wires between Vienna and Constantinople one vvA Bosnia, the other vid Servia, with absolute priority for Indo-European messages on whichever is best for the time fmm g ' learn by Major Champain's own telegram and letter from our accountant in London, that the Prussian and Eussian Tovernments have made over to Messrs. Siemens and Co., of London and -Berlin, the exclusive working of two distinct wires which are to be constructed with special regard to Indo-European traffic. Eussia is said to have even gone so far as to allow the firm to construct and own the line m her dominions. I am awaiting Major Champain's report of the particulars of this negotiation, he having been present on the occasion at St. Petersburg under official sanction. It should perhaps be mentioned that this scheme contemplates junction with the 1 ersian, and not the Turkish wires. t ' 7 ' If /A e Can n0W Secure the same Mity of working between urm and Constantinople, as between the latter city and Vienna we may trust to ordinary arrangements for the use of any other line iiaving London and the Bosphorus for its terminal points. The Uttoman Government is pledged to perform its share of the under- *1°°' v ^i 11 ^ i fc would be well to commence at once discussion ot the subject with the Italian Administration of Telegraphy. '8. lor the use of Turkish-Asiatic as well as Eussian-Asiatic, and J ersian wires, the Indian Government has the advantage of being able to treat on her own immediate interests, and independently of private telegraph companies. It has been difficult hitherto to fix a unnorm rate of payment for any but messages passing to and fro through Turkey : but if the conventions already concluded by her Majesty's ambassador at the Porte and her Majesty's minister at ran be supplemented by a quadrupartite agreement reconciling certain discrepancies of tariff arising out of separate conventions now existing between Eussia and Persia, and Persia and Turkey, I see no reason to apprehend further complications or obstruction to traffic in Asia generally, whatever the route taken. ' 9. Hitherto, as an alternative, or indeed in any other sense, the Eusso-Persian line has not answered so well as expected. The cause is not to be attributed, in any important degree, to the Caucasian or Kussian wires running north of the Persian frontier at the Arras (•Julfa), but mainly to the inefficient state of the Persian line between the frontier and lehran. When travelling in February last, I found t io wire broken, and the ends far apart, amid the snow hills betweenG16 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. Marand and Sufian, north of Tabriz ; and recent residence at Tehran has shown me how imperfect is the communication between Tabriz and the capital. This section of the line is about 450 miles in length, and is to be furnished with a second wire for our special benefit: but its management is not in our hands. The Kussians have already sent telegraph officers, and, as I understand from them, have also supplied wire and insulators. At all events, the latter materials are not want ing : but the Persians are depended on for posts, and until those now in use are strengthened or replaced, the lino cannot be con sidered trustworthy. I have strongly urged that if this section be in cluded in the Siemens scheme above mentioned, it should be the first to which attention is given. ' 10. It may not be superfluous to repeat that the line in Persia, on which the British Government possesses an exclusive wire worked by her own officers under the five years' treaty of November 1865, extends for about 1,100 miles, or from Bushahr to Tehran on the one side, and Tehran to Khanikin on the other. It should, moreover, be clearly understood that, north of Tehran, we have no control what ever. The second, or English wire, has been put up from Bushahr to Tehran, by far the larger division; and on its completion to the Turkish frontier, the treaty will be declared to have effect. I very lately came down the whole western line from Tehran to Khanikin, and can bear personal testimony to the fact that the sole cause of delay in carrying out the convention is the conduct of the Persians them selves. Orders for the supply of posts are issued by the higher authori ties of Government, and these orders are disobeyed or ignored. Con tracts are made, and, as a matter of course, broken by the contractors. The individual influence of British officers and friendly feeling of pro vincial governors eventually bring about the desired result; but only in an indirect manner, and afier loss of much time. Indeed time has no recognized value in Persia. ' 11. Full explanations have been submitted to Government why the Persian line has not worked so well during the past eighteen months as at the first. A general renewal of posts and great difficulty in pro curing them may perhaps be put down as the principal reason. But there has also been wilful damage to contend with, and it is not easy to detect, or always punish, when detected, the perpetrator. My former published report was not, however, silent on the likelihood of interruptions, and a very severe winter (18G5, 18G6) added to the contingencies then described. I have now great hopes of successful working, and would refer to the rapid communication between Tehran and Bombay during the past month or six weeks, in proof of the efficacy of the second wire so far as completed. It would be injustice to the officers employed were I to limit acknowledgment of their exertions and usefulness to mere allusion in a report like the present. '12. The question of extending the Persian land-line to Gwadar, so as to form a complete alternative to the Gulf cable, will best be illustrated by a short account of my own movements since theJ PPENDIX. date of ray last general report. On the 4tli December, 1865 under sanction ot the liombay Government and her Majesty's minister in er^ia, J proceeded trom Tehran to Ispahan, and thence turned off eastward to \ezd and Karman, with a view of ascertaining what advantages that part of the country offered, either politicallv or physically, to the erection ot a line of telegraph. Major Smith R.E accompanied me to Sabristan, about a hundred miles east of Karman' and there we separated he to make his way directly to the coast at l andar Abbas, and 1 to work through western lialuchistan or Uiarbar near Gwadan Our two journeys were successfully accom plished. AVe mot again at Charbar, and leaving that port, went bv sea to Ivarachi and Bombay. Thence we proceeded on a tour of duty to the other presidencies of India, returning to Sind by Delhi and the hills. At Simla I had the honour of submitting to the supreme Government the heads of a proposed convention with Persia based on the reports which we had just sent in to the Bombay Government: and, as the scheme met with general approval and sup port, 1 was authorized to supply all essential data for a full Foreign Office treaty. Embarking from Bombay in May, I arrived in England on the 18th June, 186G, and after many official references and com munications, besides giving evidence on the subject before the par liamentary Committee on East India Telegraphs, I received final instructions on the 18th October following. These were to proceed to Persia at once to offer the terms proposed, and negotiate under the authority of her Majesty's minister at the Shah's court. I set out on the same date from London, but did not reach Tehran till the middle ot February of the present year, having been directed by tele gram from Lord Cranborne to remain at Constantinople so Ion' as required by her Majesty's ambassador, who considered a temporary detention there important. My stay in Tehran, though prolonged to three months, did not, as in the previous case, result in successful negotiation ; but I do not consider the labour expended to have been m vain, nor the discussion commenced, to be finally closed. The occasion was perhaps unfortunate. So rare a circumstance as the bhahs journey to Mashhad absorbed all ministerial as well as popular attention, and a new telegraph convention could hardly be admitted to interfere with the state programme. There is good reason to be- ie\e that the whole question can be re-opened within the year, and with fair prospect of success. Government will however be enabled to draw its own conclusions, as my reports on this matter have been many and in detail. '* 13. In the concluding paragraph of the report of which this is a continuation, I stated my intention to submit ' what are the prospects of a new direct communication between Constantinople &lt;uid lehran by the junction of the wires from Erzrum to Tabriz.' It appears that a line has already been completed, from Sivas, a station in Asia Minor on the direct Baghdad line, to Erzrum and Kars ; and rom Alexandropol, on the Kusso-Turkish frontier, to Erivan ; leaving«48 TELEGBAPH AND THAVEL. a distance of but a few miles between Kars and Alexandropol, to open out a new direct communication between Constantinople and Tehran. The use of such an alternative line would be of great im portance to the Indian public in the event of interruptions between Sivas and the Persian Gulf, and I have received authority from the India Office to negotiate, and also had some communication with the Turkish Director-General on the subject. I know of no better or likelier means of bringing the line into the Indo-European system than by settling a tariff for it, among other rates to be put before the proposed conference mentioned in paragraph 8. ' 14. There is, moreover, now in progress a junction of the Turkish-Asiatic line at Kifri, above Baghdad, with Khanikin, by a short cross wire ; and this, when completed, will materially add to the security of our traffic. In the event of interruption below Kifri, the Indian telegram can at once pass into the Persian lines. '15. The matters above noted will doubtless interest the com mercial public. The record may serve at least to show what means appear calculated to render telegraphic communication between Europe and India more rapid, more regular, and more secure, and to what extent these means are made available. But it should also be stated, that while the present report embraces merely a general system of semi-political organization, the scientific officers of the de partment do not lose sight of the professional minutiae of telegraphy, and are ready to avail themselves of, or advocate any innovations in code or apparatus which may be found desirable. ' 1G. The introduction of the Paris convention, under certain modi fications, has been notified by the Secretary of State as applicable to Indo European messages from the 1st proximo. I have to thank Major Champain for his attention to this important arrangement as Avell as for his continued and unremitting exertions to advance in every way the interests of the telegraph. '17. A system of account has been introduced for telegrams passing from England to India vid Constantinople, by which the London com panies pay at once to the India Office such part of the cost of a tele gram as would cover the transit through the cable and India, conti nental administrations only receiving and accounting for the charge up to Eao, or to the extreme end of the Ottoman territory. 1 was desirous of introducing the same system for the Russo-Persian line, assimilating the charges from Tehran to India to those from Fao to India, for simple facilitation of account. The proposal, when made through her Majesty's ambassador at Constantinople, was at once accepted by Turkey, and communicated to the neighbouring adminis trations ; but for the Russo-Persian line, though Persia agreed on her part, Russia withheld consent. To prevent misunderstanding, I ad dressed a long explanatory memorandum to M. de Giers, the Russian minister at Tehran, and forwarded it through Mr. Alison just before leaving Persia. But I can hardly anticipate that it will obtain the end required, fur Major Champain was at St. Petersburg at the timeAPPENDIX. (&gt;49 that the refusal of the Kussiau administration to accept our proposals was made known to the Persian Director-General, and he was conse- quenuy able to combat personally any ordinary objections offered. Un er the circumstances the sole conclusion to be drawn is, that Eussia, having in a convention with Persia, fixed a certain tariff on all messages passing from her frontier to Bushahr, declines to modify that tariff on Indo-European messages, although we, by a separate convention with I ersia have laid down a tariff equally high (and even highei) for about two-thirds of the same distance, ' 18. Having last year visited the stations of Gwadar and Karachi, J was glad to have the opportunity of visiting, this year, Fao, Bushahr and Masandam. I certainly am of opinion that, in a purely sanitary point of view, it would be desirable to move the establish ment at the last named to a less confined locality. The heat may not be very much greater than at Bushahr, but the high encircling Jocks and limited view to seaward must have a depressing effect upon Europeans, especially during the hot season. On this subject, as well as on certain other questions of telegraph organization and detail not here noticed, 1 propose doing myself the honour of separately address ing government.' J CHANGE IN THE COURSE OF CABLE, p. 301. On the 6th February, 18G9, Col. Goldsmid thus addressed the Bombay Government:— ' Referring to my letter on which was published Government Resolution TSo. 15 of the 14th ultimo,. I have the honour to forward ie engineer s report, and an accompanying diagram, in illustration of the change effected in the course of the cable in the Persian Gulf.

' The cable laid on the first trip was left buoyed to facilitate picking up the ends to splice on the remaining cable, and the whole of the cable was safely laid without any hitch or accident. On the 1st December the smaller diversion of the cable through the new station at Jask was commenced. This was facilitated by the original line of the cable passing within two miles of that point. The operations were commenced by landing two shore ends, ta ing the ends into the temporary office, and laying them to seaward towards the line of cable : four miles were thus laid, and the ends buoyed, it cTl was the'n out ou the morning of the 3rd December each end successively picked up a short distance, and relaid towards the buoys when the surplus was cut off and the ends spliced to the shore ends completing the work the same evening. 1 he amount cut out of circuit was two and quarter miles, so that the line was permanently lengthened by one and three -quarter miles.

It commences by running to the north, turns sharply to the westward, and after being fed by the Sherian Su and one or two small streams, it passes to the south, S .S. W., 8. W., west and by south, and again west, till, meeting a new feeder in the Charbehar Su, it makes a fresh zigzag to the south, and then commences its long, irregu lar passage to the west, where it takes the classical name of Euphrates. The source of the Tigris should be near the Giuljak Lake, and still nearer to Argana Madan. According to Mr. Brant we should have crossed it, on issuing from the Batman, on our way to Kizin and Kliarput. But both these great rivers have many sources, if every feeder be admitted to claim a right to partnership. We passed one source of the actual Euphrates, that is of the Murad Chai before it becomes the Euphrates, on our road to Hasan Chelibi and the Kizdbash mountain-homes : it was ^dignified by the title of Kuru thai, or the ' dry river.' CHAPTER XI. P rofessor de Filippi, in his 'Viaggio in Persia,' gives a graphic account of an ascent of Demavend, to accomplish which he leftTELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. Tejrish, one of the summer resorts of European diplomatists, on the 9th August, 1862. lie was accompanied 'by MM. Lessona, Orio, Ferrati, Clemencich, Doria, Centurione and (Major) Champain. They entered the Elhurz mountains by Sinak and a branch of the Jajrud ; and passing near the village of Kubad almost hidden by the trees, they arrived at Ilaftcheh, where quarters were assigned them in the Sadr Azim's castle. Continuing their journey on the day following into the valley of the Lar, they found the river of that name abound ing in trout, and were charmed with the scenery and climate. Tents were pitched at Hanlar Khan. On the 11th they were guided by the course of the river, and pursued their way among the tents of the Kurd Iliats, who migrate in summer from Yeramin to the cooler mountain pastures. It was not until the 13th that the summit of Demavend was attained. Although the first to set foot there was Signor Orio, who patriotically signalised his achievement by waving his handkerchief affixed to a stick with a loud-sounding 'Viva Italia,' he was immediately followed by Champain ; whom, moreover, Professor de Filippi associates with Professor Lessona in the per- formance of another and more perilous feat,—viz., the intricate passage of a deep, snow-filled chasm without the aid of a guide. The narrator himself could not share the honour with the rest. After accomplishing four-fifths of the ascent, he was compelled by nausea, vertigo, and other natural physical results of the rarity of the atmosphere, to abandon his intentions. Nor was he the only sufferer. Others also had equally expended their efforts in vain. We are led to infer that only four of the party, Orio, Ferrati, Lessona and Champain were successful. The two last heard, at the same moment, when just below the crater, a loud noise above them, and saw a thick vapour arise, the air being filled with sulphurous exhalations. The original may here be quoted (p. 267):— ' 11 Prof. Lessona ed il Capitano Champain furono i soli che, governando prudentemente il bastone, escirono da questo passo senza ajuto della guide, mentre altre due non furono salvi che per la pron- tezza onde furono soccorsi. A1 di la di questo passo 1' erta riprende faticosissima su di una cresta rocciosa, poi di nuovo su di un'^ erta di lapilli piu ripida delle precedenti. Da questo punto si vede gia 1' orlo del cratere tutto giallo di solfo. Succede un nuovo avvallamento occupato da una gran massa di neve meno erta della precedente, ma non meno pericolosa in altra ora od in altra stagione, quando, solidificata dal freddo, non ceda sotto il passo. Qui il Prof. Lessona ed il Capitano Champain sentirono contemporaneamente uno scoppioAPPENDIX. 653 (lalla ciraa del monte, e videro sollevarsi un denso getto di vapore : 1' aria d' ogni intorno era piena di esalazioni solfuree. Si compie 1' ultimo tratto della salita nella neve cosparsa di polvere di solfo, o nella roccia incrostata di solfo. Primo a toccar la sommita (eran le 2 pome- ridiane) fu Orio, che fece sventolar il fazzoletto sulla punta del bastone, gridando viva Italia. Fu immediatamente raggiunto dal capitano inglese, poi dagli altri.' Professor de Filippi reports the several ascents of Denaavend accomplished or attempted from 1837 to 1862 inclusive. He also states the result of surveys and observations at different periods. The truest computation of height is believed to bo that of the Russian Chronometrical Survey in 1861-62, determining it at 5,670 metres, about 18,600 English feet. STATEMENT referred to at the conclusicn of the first part pp. 389, 390. The Indo European Telegraph Department had, so far as its lines extended, the monopoly of traffic between Europe and the East, from the commencement of 1865 to the commencement of 1870. Its earn ings during that period averaged in round numbers £92,000 per annum, and ifs expenditure £87,000. A slight profit was thus realised. From March 1870 to the present time, the department has had to compete with the powerful opposition of the Eastern Telegraph Company, owing principally to which, its earnings for the three years, ending March 1873, fell to an average of £53,000 per annum ; but its expenditure was on the other hand reduced to an average of £75,000. In 1873-74 the earnings rallied and increased to about £61,000, and the expenditure, though not yet finally ascertained, is estimated not to have exceeded £68,000. A further improvement is continuing, the result for the present year, anticipated by the writer, being earnings £65,000 and expenditure £65,000; or the attainment of a point at which the revenue and expense will be again equal, prepara tory it is hoped, to the gain once more of a slight profit. Besides the competition of the Red Sea line, other causes have how ever materially affected the financial position of the department. The first was, the bad working on the foreign lines, between the head of the Persian Gulf and England, which continued the whole of the five years the department possessed the monopoly of communication, and prevented the realisation of a fair return on its capital.(554 telegraph and travel. A portion of the bad working no doubt occurred in Europe; but by far the chief part took place in Turkey, where, notwithstand ing the permanent presence of a British Commissioner at head quarters ; frequent visits of the chief directors of the department; and reiterated remonstrances and complaints; nearly all messages were subjected to enormous delays, and transmitted in the greatest dis order : the common stoppage of traffic at the central office ot Pera alone being on the average upwards of eighteen hours per message. The tariff in force between England and India from 1805 to the end of 1868 was £6 for a message of twenty words. On 1st January, 1869, it was reduced to &lt;£2 17s., the reduction being made partly in consequence of public complaints of dearness, and paitly in deference to the views of the chief continental telegraph authorities assembled in conference at ^ ienna in 1S68, who, while officially promising to interest themselves in the improvement of Indo-European communication, then for the first time brought prominently into inter national notice, strongly urged that the rates beyond Europe should be made less costly. The experiment, however, was unsuccessful. The bad working west of the Persian Gulf continued, and proved an in superable obstacle to a sufficient increase in the number of messages to compensate for the reduction in tariff. The result was that in 1869 the department sustained a loss in revenue of nearly &lt;£20,000. In 1870, the aspect of Eastern telegraphy entirely changed. The Indo- European Telegraph Company, projected in 1868, with a name closely assimilated to that of the Government Department, and with the object of establishing a solid line from London through Prussia and Russia to Tehran, where the wires managed by the department terminate, completed its work of construction on the 30th January, and on the 31st, the new through route was opened. In a month or two it became thoroughly organized, and messages were transmitted by it in fewer hours than they had taken days before, and with an accuracy of reproduction and precision of order, to which no semblance of an approach had ever previously been made. Traffic at once began to increase, and the £2 17s. rate would doubtless now have yielded a satisfactory profit to both the Indo -European Company and the Indo- European Department; but the Red Sea line, projected in 1869, was at this time also opened, and a great proportion of the messages at once diverted to it. Considerably as the total traffic continued to in crease, yet being now divided among three routes, it proved insufficient to pay either; the rates via Tehran and vid the Red Sea were therej ppendix. 655 fore raised to 10s. in February 1871. Eut this tariff still proving inadequate to produce a fair remuneration, the Indo-European and lied Sea Companies complained that their lines, paid for and maintained by private capita], and furnishing for the first time efficient communi cation with. India, should be undersold by the Turkish line, which, supported by state revenues, continued to work, at a dead loss, at the old &lt;£2 175. tariff. A sub-international conference was held at Berne to consider the question. The importance of maintaining the incom parably improved means of communication furnished by the com panies was fully recognised; and, as the only means of effecting it, the Turkish administration was persuaded to raise its rates to £4 10s. also. In July 1872, however, the rates were again somewhat lowered, and made £3 15s. vid Turkey, and &lt;£4 vid Tehran, or the lied Sea, which figures have continued in force for Anglo-Indian mes sages up to the present time. But for Australian, China, and other far- east messages, reductions have been made on the Cis-Indian lines, equalling a discount of from 20 to 30 per cent, from the rates named, in order that the total through charges should not be considered pro hibitory. The tariff hitherto spoken of has been for a message of twenty words, increasing by one-half for every additional ten, or fraction of ten, words above twenty. This is the European international system, and has been so for upwards of thirty years. Upon the comparatively short and inexpensive lines of the Continent and the United Kingdom it has answered very well; but upon very long and costly lines it is unsuitable. Eastern »end European merchants have, from the first, made considerable use of language of preconcerted meaning in their messages, accomplishing thus the double object of ensuring additional secresy and economizing words. Within the last few years, they have so elaborated and perfected this mode of telegraphy, that a single word generally represents a whole sentence. They therefore frequently require to send only five or six words in a message. As under the international rules no proportionate reduction of charge can be made for this description of traffic, the want has been met by packing, a business which has been organized since 1872, and has yielded great profits to the organizers, from the capital expended in establishing the telegraph lines, A packer collects, for instance, four messages of five words each, at say 5s. per word, puts them into one message of twenty words, and sends the latter to his agent for &lt;£4, thus clearing by tho transaction £1, less his working expenses.(j56 TELEGRAPH AND TRAVEL. But effective measures have for some time been in progress to check this business. The representatives of the Indian Government at the International Telegraph Conference of 1871, foreseeing that the twenty- word standard could not be permanently upheld, obtained from the European Administrations the best agreement then possible for a lower standard, and caused to be inserted in the International Convention a provision for ten-word messages, with a subsequent charge for each single word on the lines east of Europe. It being impossible, however, at the time to arrange for any reduction of the European transit charge, the provision was temporarily kept in abeyance. But it has, at some little pecuniary sacrifice, been lately brought into force where most needed, and ten-word messages at half rates, with subsequent gradation per single word, have been introduced between England and India with marked success, inflicting a heavy blow upon the packing business. Steps are being further taken to introduce a word tariff, pure and simple, for all Indo-European messages. When this is effected, the ground, for the most part, will be cut from under the packers' feet, and the business will die away, or nearly so. The improvement in the means of communication with India since 1870, and the subsequent extension of the telegraphic system to China, Japan, Australia, &amp;c., have increased the tratfic on the Cis- Indian lines to about three times what it was in the days of monopoly vid Turkey, with postal service only beyond India About 10,000 rates of twenty words each now represent the traffic per mensem through the Cis-Indian lines. Of the total, the Turkish line obtains about 4 per cent., the Tehran line about 32 per cent., and the Red Sea line the remainder, or about 64 per cent. One reason why the Eastern line obtains the bulk of the traffic is, that being in the hands of a single company, its actions are freer, and its interests can be better pushed than those of the other lines, which, belonging partly to a company, and partly to different governments, cannot move in any matter without previous consultation of the directorates, and consequent loss of time. But the chief reason of the advantage possessed by the Eastern Company undoubtedly is, that it is intimately associated with the Extension companies beyond India, and this association secures to it a virtual monopoly of the Trans -Indian messages. These, although less remunerative than Indian ones, yet make a considerable show in point of numbers. As the messages vid Turkey and vid Tehran both necessarily pass over the lines of this department, the latter transmits rather more thanAPPENDIX. 6 5 7 one-third of the entire traffic exchanged between Europe on one side, and India and the lar East on the other, and this third represents really a greater number of rates than the department dealt with when it possessed the monopoly of Eastern communication. The reduction of tariff, however, and the passage of nearly all its present share of the messages, over a shorter length of its cables, render the receipts now of less value than formerly. Briefly, the main reasons why the department has not hitherto been more financially successful are, first, that when it had the monopoly of communication, the bad working of the foreign lines, west of tin* Persian Gulf, prevented all development of traffic; and secondly, that imme diately a triendly and excellent route connected its lines with England and traffic began to become remunerative, an opposition line opened, and at once shared the messages. Ihe earnings of the department shown in the Kevenue Account are made up of the entire net receipts of the Persian Gulf cables and land-lines, and a portion of the Persian receipts, obtained as follows. The entire transit receipts between Bushahr and Tehran (the Persian length worked by officers of the department), are subject to a first charge of about £4,800 per annum for Persian royalty. K^lf the balance is received by the department as earnings, and half is due to the Indo-European Company in return for the risk incurred by it in guaranteeing the royalty, and for the obligation contracted by it of being the medium for the payment of the Persian debt, shown in the capital account. The Company's half is, however, sequestrated by the department, till the debt is liquidated. A. B rasher. U UAPPENDIX. 659 Note to foregoing. —Mr. Alfred Hrasher was appointed traffic manager of the Indo-European telegraph in 1863, and was the first officer who held any appointment of this nature under the Indian Government. He drew up the whole of the numerous forms required for the depart ment, organized a check and account office at Karachi, prepared the large tariff hooks (then showing separate rates for towns as well as countries) used throughout India from 1864 to 1869, and translated the different conventions whose rules prevailed in India during the same period. Independently of these indoor duties, he had taken part in the Persian Gulf Cable Expedition of 1864, and lent active aid, by superintendence and otherwise, in the work of connecting the Turkish land wires below Basrah to the cable at Fao. Mr. Brasher's forms were borrowed and his check and account system was adopted by the Indian telegraph department on re-organization, and a similar appointment to his own was created under the title of Traffic Director. In 1867 he was promoted to his present post in London, the work of which comprises settlement and revision of international and departmental accounts, preparation of budget estimates and capital and revenue accounts for parliamentary reference, translation of Berne circulars, and fulfilment of the duties of the Chief Director on any occasion of that officer's absence from England.

Sir Samuel Baker here describes twelve months' 1 exploration, during which he examined the rivers that are tributary to the Nile from Abyssinia, including the Atbara, Settite, Royan, Salaam, Angrab, Rahad, Binder, and the Blue Nile. The interest attached to these portions of Africa differs entirely from that of the White Nile regions, as the whole of Upper Egypt and Abyssinia is capable of development, and is inhabited by races having some degree of civilization; while Central Africa is peopled by a race of savages, whose future is more problematical. The Times says 11 It solves finally a geographical riddle which hitherto had been extremely peiplexing, and it adds much to our information respecting Egyptian Abyssinia and the different races that spread over it. It contains, morecn'er, some notable instances of English daring and enterprising skill; it abounds in am- mated tales of exploits dear to the heart of the British sportsman; and it will attract even the least studious reader, as the author tells a story well, and can describe nature with uncommon power.'

By James Bryce, D.C.L., Regius Professor of Civil Law, Oxford, Fourth Edition Revised and Enlarged. Crown 8vo. ']$. 6d. The object of this treatise is not so much to give a narrative history of the countries included in the Romano'Germanic Empire Italy during the Middle Ages, Germany from the ninth century to the nineteenth—as to describe the Holy Empire itself as an institution or system, the wonderful offspring of a body of beliefs and traditions which have almost wholly passed away from the world. To make such a description intelligible it has appeared best to give the book the form rather of a narrative than of a dissertation ; and to combine with an exposition of what may be called the theory of the Empire an outline of the political history of Germany, as well as some notice of the affairs oj mediaeval Italy. Nothing else so directly linked the old world to the new as the Roman Empire, which exercised over the minds of men an influence such as its material strength could never have commanded. It it of this influence, and the causes that gave it power, that the present work is designed to treat. 'It exactly supplies a want: it affords a key to much which men read of in their books as isolated facts, but of iv huh they have hitherto had no connected exposition set before them.

The author here regards Chatterton as a Poet, not as a 'mere resetter anddefacer oj stolen literary treasures.' Reviewed in this lirht he has found much in the old materials capable of being turned to new account: and to these materials research in various directions has enabled him to make some additions. He believes that the boy-poet has been misjudged, and that the biographies hitherto written of him are not only imperfect but untrue. While dealing tenderly, the author has sought to deal truthfully with the failings as well as the virtues of the boy: bearing always in remembrance, what has been too frequently lost sight of that he was but a boy ;—a boy, and yet a poet of rare power. The E xaminer thinks this 'the most complete and the purest biography of the poet which has yet appeared.' Cooper. — ATHENE CANTABRIGIENSES.

In a Preface the Editor says:— ' Among the various pictures, recitals, and descriptions which have appeared, both of our gloriously ended national war as a whole, and of its several episodes, we think that in laying before the German public, through a translation, the following War Letters 'which appeared first in the Daily N ews, and were afterwards published collectiz ely, we are offering them a picture of the events of the war of a quite peculiar character. These com- munications have the advantage of being at once entertaining and instruc tive, free from every romantic embellishment, and nevertheless written in a vein intelligible and not fatiguing to the general reader. The writers linger over events, and do not disdain to surround the great and heroic war-pictures with arabesques, gay and grave, taken from camp-life and the life of the inhabitants of the occupied territory. A feature which distinguishes these Letters from all other delineations of the war is that they do not proceed from a single pen, but were written from the camps of both belligerents.' ' These notes and comments' according to the Saturday review, ' are in reality a very well executed and continuous history. Dilke.— GREATER BRITAIN.

Two courses are open, either to take a general and consequently dry history oj facts, such as RusseWs Mcda-n Europe, or to choose some work treating of a particular period or subject, such as the works of Macaulay and Eroude. The former course usually renders history uninteresting; the latter is unsatisfactory, because it is not sufficiently comprehensive. To remedy this difficulty, selections, conti/iuous and chronological, haue in the present volume been taken Jrom the larger works of Ereeman, Milman, Palgrave, Lingard, Hume, and others, which may serve as distinct landmarks of historical reading. ' Wt know of scarcely anything,' says the G uardian, of this volume, ' which is so likely to raise to a higher level the average standard of English education.'MA CM ILL A APS CATALOGUE OF WORKS Ih Fairfax (Lord).— A LIFE OF THE GREAT LORD FAIR FAX, Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the Parliament of England.

HISTORICAL ESSAYS. By Edward Freeman, M.A., Hon. D.C.L., late Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford. Second Edition. 8vo. ioj , (yd. This volume contains twelve Essays selected from the author's contri butions to various Reviews. The principle on which they were chosen was that of selecting papers which referred to comparatively modern times, or, at least, to the existing states and nations oj Europe. By a sort of accident a number of the pieces chosen have thrown themselves into something like a continuous series bearing on the historical causes of the great events of 1870—71. Notes have been added whenever they seemed to be called for; and whenever he could gain in accuracy of statement or in force or clearness oj expression, the author has freely changed, added to, or left out, what he originally wrote. To many of the Essays has been added a short note of the circumstances under which they were written. It is needless to say that any product of Mr. Freeman's pen is worthy of attentive perusal; and it is believed that the contents of this volume will throw light on several subjects of great historical importance and the widest interest. The following is a list of the subjects:—!. 'The Mythical and Romantic Elements in Early English History;' II. ' The Continuity of English History;' III. ' The Relations between the Crcnvns of England and Scotland;' IV. 'St. Thomas of Canter-IO MACMILLAIsTS CATALOGUE OF WORKS IN Freeman (E. A.)—continued. bury and his Biographers;' V.

These Essays chiefly relate to earlier periods of history than those which were dealt with in the former volume—to the times commonly known as Ancient or 'Classical.'

The principal Essays are:— 'Ancient Greece and Medieval Italy:' 'Mr. Gladstones Homer and the Homeric Ages:' ' The Historians oj Athens:' ' The Athenian Democracy:' ' Alexander the Great : n Greece during the Macedonian Period:' ' Mommsen s History of Rome:' 'Lucius Cornelius Sulla :' ' The Flavian Cccsars.' — S aturday R eview. HISTORY OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, from the Foun dation of the Achaian League to the Disruption of the United States. Vol I. General Introduction. History of the Greek Federations. Svo. 21s. Mr. Freeman's aim, in this elaborate and valuable work, is not so much to discuss the abstract nature of Federal Government, as to exhibit its actual working in ages and countries wideiy removed from one another. Four Federal Commonwealths stand out, in four different ages of the world, as commanding above all others the attention of students of political history, viz. the Achaian league, the Swiss Cantons, the United Provinces, the United States. The first volume, besides containing a General Introduce tion, treats of the first of these. In writing this volume the author has endeavoured to combine a text which may be instructive and interesting to any thoughtful reader, whether specially learned or not, with notes which may satisfy the requirements of the most exacting scholar. ' The task Mr. Freeman has undertaken' the S aturday R eview says, 'is oneHISTORY, BIOGRAPHY, &amp; TRAVELS. Freeman (E. A.) — continued. of great magnitude and importance. It is also a task of an almost entirely novel character. No other work professing to give the history of a political principle occurs to us, except the slight contributions to the history of representative government that is contained in a course of M. Guizot's lectures .... The history of the development of a principle is at least as important as the history of a dynasty, or of a race.' OLD ENGLISH IIISTORV. With Five Coloured Maps.

' lis object,' the Preface says, 'is to show that clear, accurate, and scientific views of history, or indeed of any subject, may be easily given to children from the very first. ... I have throughout striven to connect the history of England with the general history of civilized Europe, and I have especially tried to make the book serve as an incentive to a more accurate study of historic geography.' The rapid sale of the first edition arid the universal approval with which the zvork has been received prove the correct ness of the author's notions, and show that for such a book there was ample room. The work is suited not only tor children, but will serve as an excellent text-book for older students, a clear and faithful summary of the history of the period for those who wish to revive their historical know- ledge, and a book full of charms for the getuwal reader. The work is preceded by a complete chronological Table, and appended is an exhaustive and useful Index. In the present edition the whole has been carefully revised, and such improvements as suggested themselves have been introduced. ' The book indeed is full of instruction and interest to students of all ages, and he must be a well-in)oi med matt indeed who will not rise from its perusal with clearer and more accurate ideas of a too much neglected portion of English history.' —spectator.

The three Chapters oj which this work consists are an expansion of two Lectures delivered by Mr. Freeman ; appended are copious notes, the whole book forming a graphic and interesting sketch of the history of the British Constitution, from an original point of view. The author shows that the characteristic elements of the British Constitution arc common to the whole of the Aryan nations. His '' object has been to show that the earliest institutions of England and of other Teutonic lands are not mere matters of curious speculation, but matters closely connected with our present politi cal being.

Being Vol. I. of a Historical Course for Schools edited by E. A. Freeman. iSmo. 3j. (id. Third Edition. The present volume is meant to be introductory to the whole course. It is intended to give, as its name implies, a genei-al sketch of the history of the civilized world, that is, of Europe, and of the lands which have draion their civilization from Europe. Its object is to trace out the general rela tions of different periods and different countries to one another, without going minutely into the affairs of any particular country. This is an object of the first importance, for, without clear notions of general history, the history of particular countries can never be rightly understood. The narrative extends from the earliest movements of the Aryan peoples, denvn to the latest events both on the Eastern and IVestern Continents. TheHISTORY, BIOGRAPHY, 6- TRAVELS. book consists of seventeen moderately shed chapters, each chapter being divided into a number of short numbered paragraphs, each with a title prefixed clearly indicative of the subject of the paragraph.

It has been the endeavour op the compiler to place before the reader a plain, ungarbled statement of facts ; and, as a means to this end, to allow Galileo, his friends, and his judges to speak for themselves as far as possible. All the best authorities have been made use of, and all the materials which exist for a biography have been in this volume put into a symmetrical form. The result is a ?nost touching picture skilfully arra nged of the great heroic man of science and his devoted daughter, whose letters are full of the deepest reverential love and trust, amply repaid by the noble soul. The S atur day R eview says of the book, 'It is not so much the philosopher as the man who is seen in this simple and life-like sketch, and the hand which portrays the features and actions is mainly that of one who had studied the subject the closest and the most intimately. This little volume has done much within its slender compass to prove the depth and tenderness of Galileo's heart.' Gladstone (Right Hon. W. E., M.P.)— juventus MUNDI.

This work of Mr. Gladstone deals especially with the historic element in Homer, expounding that element and furnishing by its aid a full account of the Homeric men and the Homeric religion. It starts, after the introductory chapter, with a discussion of the several races then existing in Hellas, including the influence of the Phoenicians and Egyptians. It contains chapters on the Olympian system, with its several deities; on the Ethics and the Polity of the Heroic age; on the Geography of Homer; on the characters of the Poems ; presenting, in fine, a view of primitive life and primitive society as found in the poems of Homer. To this New14 MACMILLAN'S CATALOGUE OF WORKS IN Edition various additions have been made. 'Seldom,' says the A the- NiCUM, '' out of the great poems themselves, have these Divinities looked so majestic and respectable.

This little volume is full of interesting details about Mendelssohn from his tweljth yeat onwat ds, and especially of his intimate and frequent in- tercout se with Goethe. It is an episode of IViemar 1 s golden days which we see before us—old age and fame hand in hand with youth in its aspiring efforts ; the aged poet fondling the curls of the little musician and calling to him in playful and endearing accents ' to make a little noise for him, and awaken the winged spirits that have so long lain slumbering.' Here wiil be found letters and reports of conversations between the two, touching on all subjects, human and divine—Music, Esthetics, Art, Poetry, Science, Morals, and 11 the profound and ancient problem of human life' as well as reminiscences of celt bra ted men with whom the great composer came in contact. The letters appended give, among other matters, some interesting glimpses into the private life of Her Majesty Queen Victoria and the late Prince Ai ett.

Narrated in connection with the Political, Ecclesiastical, and Literary History of his Time. By David Masson, M. A., LL .D., Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature in the University of Edinburgh. Vols. I. to III. with Portraits, ^2 12s. Vol. XL, 1638—1643. 8vo. i 6 j. Vol. HI. 1643—1649. Svo. i8j. This work is not only a Biography, but also a continuous Political, Ecclesiastical, and Literary History of England through Milton's whole time. In order to understand Milton, his position, his motives, his thoughts by himself, his public words to his countrymen, and the probable effect of those words, it was necessary to refer largely to the History of his Time, not only as it is presented in well-kncnon books, but as it had to be rediscovered by express and laborious investigation in original and forgotten records: thus of the Biography, a History grew: not a mere popular compilation, but a work of independent search and method from first to l ist, which has cost wore labour by far than the Biography. The second volume is so arranged that the reader may select or omit either the History or Biography. The North British Review, speaking of the first volume of this work said, ' The Life of Milton is here written once for &lt;///.' Ihe Nonconformist, in noticing the second volume, says, 'Its literary excellence entitles it to take its place in the first ranks of our literature, while the whole style of its execution marks it as the only book that has done anything like adequate justice to one of the great masters of our language, and one of our truest patriots, as well as our greatest epic poet.'

This is the second of the Memoirs illustrative of ' Cambridge in the Seventeenth Century,' that of Nicholas Farrar having preceded it. It gives a lively picture of England during the Civil Wars the most important crisis of our national life; it supplies materials for the history of he University and our Endcnved Schools, and gives us a view of country clergy at a time when they are supposed to have been, with scarce an ex ception, scurrilous sots.

B. Mitford, Second Secretary to the British Legation in Japan. With upwards of 30 Illustrations, drawn and cut on Wood by Japanese Artists. Two Vols, crown 8vo. 2 is. Under the influence of more enlightened ideas and of a liberal system of policy, the old Japanese civilization is fast disappearing, and will, in a fcio years, be completely extinct. It was important, therefore, to preserve as far as possible trustworthy records of a state of society which, although venerable from its antiquity, has for Europeans the dawn of novelty ; hence the series of narratives and legends translated by Mr. Mitford, and in which the Japanese are veiy judiciously left to tell their own tale. The two volumes comprise not only stories and episodes illustrative of Asiatic superstitions, but also three sermons. The preface, appendices, and notes explain a number of local peculiarities ; the thirty-one woodcuts are the genuine work of a native artist, who, unconsciously of course, has adopted the process first introduced by the early German masters. ' These very original volumes will always be interesting as memorials of a most exceptional society, while regarded simply as tales, they are sparkling, sensa tional, and dramatic, and the originality of their ideas and the quaintnessm 24 MACMILLAN'S CATALOGUE OF WORKS IN of their language give them a most captivating piquancy.

This work is the result of inquiries made by the author, of all authorities competent to afford him information, and of his own observation during a lengthened sojourn in the Southern States, to which writers on America so seldom direct their steps. The author's object is to give some account of the condition of the Southern States wider the new social and political system introduced by the civil war. He has here collected such notes of the progress of their cotton plantations, of the state of their labouring population and of their industrial enterprises, as may help the reader to a safe opinion of their means and prospects of development. He also gives such information of their natural resources, railways, and other public works, as may tend to show to what extent they are fitted to become a profitable field of enlarged immigration, settlement, and foreign trade.

To reject the aid of archeology in the progress of science, and especially of ethnological science, is to extinguish the lamp of the student ■when most dependent on its borrowed rays.' A prolonged residence on some of the neivest sites of the Nerv World has afforded the author many opportunities of investigating the antiquities of the American Aborigines, and of bringing to light many facts of high importance in reference to primeval man. The changes in the new edition, necessitated by the great advance in Archeology since the first, include both reconstruction and condensation, along with considerable additions alike in illustration and in argument. ' We find' says the Athenaeum, ' the main idea of his treatise to be a pre-eminently scientific one,—namely, by archaeological records to obtain a definite conception of the origin and nature of mans earliest efforts at civilization in the New World, and to endeavour to dis cover, as if by analogy, the necessary conditions, phases, and epochs through which man in the prehistoric stage in the Old World also must necessarily have passed.'''

CHATTERTON : A Biographical Study, By Daniel Wilson, LL .D., Professor of History and English Literature in University College, Toronto. Crown 8vo. 6s. 6d. The author here regards Chatter ton as a poet, not as a 11 mere resetter and defacer of stolen literary treasures.' Reviewed in this light, he has found much in the old materials capable of being turned to new account: and to these materials research in various directions has enabled him to make some additions. He believes that the boy-poet has been misjudged, and that the biographies hitherto written of him are not only imperfect but untrue. While dealing tenderly, the author has sought to deal truthfully with the failings as well as the virtues of the boy: bearing always in remembrance, what has been too frequently lost sight of, that he was but a boy ;— a boy, and yet a poet of rare penoer. The Examiner thinks this '' the most complete and the purest biography of the poet which has yet appeared.'

The speeches which have been selected for publication in these volumes possess a value, as examples of the art of public speaking, which no person will be likely to underrate. The speeches have been selected with a view of supplying the public with the evidence on which Mr. Brights friends assert his right to a place in the front rank of English statesmen. They are divided into groups, according to their subjects. The editor has naturally given prominence to those subjects with which Mr. Bright has been specially identified, as, for example, India, America, Ireland, and Parliamentary Reform. But nearly every topic of great public interest on which Mr. Bright has spoken is represented in these volumes. 'Mr. Bright's speeches will always deserve to be studied, as an apprentice ship to popular and parliamentary oratory; they will form materials for the history of our time, and many brilliant passages, perhaps some entire speeches, will really become a part of the living literature of England.' —Daily News.

In this little work are explained as briefly as possible the most im portant principles of Political Economy, in the hope that it will be useful to beginners, and perhaps be an assistance to those who are desirous of introducing the study of Political Economy to schools. In order to adapt the book especially for school use, questions have been added at the end of each chapter. In the new edition each page has been carefully revised, and at the end of each chapter, after the questions, a few little puzzles have been added, which will give interest to the book, and teach the learner to think for himself.

THE COAL QUESTION : An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of our Coal Mines. Second Edition, revised. 8vo. 10s. 6d. ' Day by day,' the author says, 'it becomes more evident that the coal we happily possess in excelletit quality and abundance is the mainspring op modern material civilization.' Geologists and other competent authorities have op late been hinting that the supply of coal is by no means inexhaustible, and as it is of vast importance to the country and the 'world generally to know the real state of the case. Professor Jevons in this 'work has endeavoured to solve the question as far as the data at command admit. He believes that should the consumption multiply for rather more than a century at its present rate, the average depth of our coal mines would be so reduced that we could not long continue our present rate of p rogress. 'We have to make the momentous choice,' he believes, 'between brief greatness and long-continued prosperity.'—'The question of our supply of coal,' says the Pall Mall Gazette, ' be comes a question obviously of life or death. . , . The 'whole case is stated with admirable clearness and cogency. ... We may regard his statements as unanswered and practically established.' THE THEORY OF POLITICAL ECONOMY. 8vo. 9^. In this 7i'ork Professor fez'ons endeavours to construct a theory of Political Economy on a mathematical or quantitative basis, h.lievxng that many of the commonly received theories in this science re per niciously erroneous. The author here attempts to treat Economy as the Calculus of Pleasure and Pain, and has sketched out, almost irrespective of previous opinions, the form which the science, as it seems to him, must ultimately take. The theory consists in apply' ing the differential calculus to the familiar notions of Wealth, Utility, Value, Demand, Supply, Capital, Interest, Labour, and all the other notions belonging to the daily operations of industry. As the complete theory of almost every other science involves the use of that calculus, so, the author thinks, we cannot have a true theory48 MACMILLAN'S CATALOGUE OF of Political Economy without its aid.

With an Intro duction on the Principles of Judicial Evidence. 8vo. 12S. 6d. No one is more competent than Mr. Fit-fames Stephen to write on the subject of which he here treats. The Introduction, indeed, may be regarded as a short treatise on the theory of evidence, and, in connection with the appended Act of 1872, the author hopes it may prove useful to civil servants who are preparing in England for their Indian career, and to the law students in Indian Universities. The subject is one which reaches far beyond law. The law of evidence is nothing unless it is founded upon a rational conception of the manner in which truth as to all matters offact whatever ought to be investigated.

The object of this work is to furnish students 0/ Shakespeare and Bacon with a short systematic account of some points of difference behueen Elizabethan Syntax and our oivn. The demand for a third edition within a year of the publication of the first, has encouraged the author to endeavour to make the work somewhat more useful, and to render it, as far as possible, a complete book of reference for all difficulties of Shakesperian Syntax or Prosody. For this purpose the whole of Shakespeare has been re-read, and an attempt has been made to include within this edition the explanation of every idiomatic difficulty (where the text is not confessedly corrupt) that comes within the province of a grammar as distinct from a glossary. The great object being to make a useful book of reference for students and for classes in schools, several Plays have been indexed so fully, that with the aid of a glossary and historical notes the references will serve for a complete commentary.

By James Helfenstein, Ph.D. 8vo. iSs. This work traces the different stages of development through which the various Teutonic languages have passed, and the laws wheh have regulated their growth. The reader is thus enabled o study the relation which these languages bear to one another, and to the L g lish language in particular, to which sp'ial attentvn rs devoted throughout. In the chapters on Ancient and Middle Iconic languages no grammatical form is omitted the knowledge of whuh is required for the study of ancient literature, whether Gothic or Anglo-Saxon or Early English. To each chapter is prefixed a sketch shcrwingthe relation of the Teutonic to the cognate language, Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit. Those who have mastered the book will be in a position to proceed with intelligence to the more elaborate works of Grimm, Bopp, Pott, Schleicher, and others.

In the writing of this volume, moreover, he has taken advantage of the researches into our language made by all the most eminent scholars m England, America, and on the Continent. The author shows the place of English among the languages of the world, expounds clearly and with great minuteness 'Grimm's Law,' gives a brief history of the English language and an account of the various dialects, investigates the history and principles of Phonology, Orthography, Accent, and Etymology, and devotes several chapters to the consideration of the various Parts of Speech, and the final one to Derivation and Word-formation.

This work is the result of an independent and careful study of the writers of the strictly Classical period, the period embraced between the time of Plautus and that of Suetonius. The author's aim has been to give the facts of the language in as few words as possible. It will be found that the arrangement of the book and the treatment op the various divisions differ in many respects from those ofprevious grammars. Mr. Roby has given special prominence to the treat ment of Sounds and Word-formation ; and in the First Book he has done much towards settling a discussion which is at present largely engaging the attention of scholars, viz., the Pronunciation of the Classical languages. In the full Appendices will be found various valuable details still further illustrating the subjects discussed in the text. The author's reputation as a scholar and critic is already well knenvn, and the publishers are encouraged to believe that his present work will take its place as perhaps the most original, exhaus tive, and scientific grammar of the Latin language that has ever issued from the British press. 'The book is marked by the clear and practical insight of a master in his art. It is a book which would do honour to any country.' —Athen^UM.

The book has already been adopted by many teachers, and is prescribed as a text-book in the Cambridge Higher Examinations for Women: and it is hoped that the reduced size and price, and the other changes now introduced, may make it more generally useful than heretofore for Educational purposes. E58 MACMILLAN'S CATALOGUE OF Trench.— Works by R. C henevix T rench, D.D., Archbishop of Dublin. (For other Works by the same Author, see T heological C atalogue.) Archbishop Trench has done much to spread an interest in the history of our English tongue. He is acknowledged to possess an un common power of presenting, in a clear, instructive, and interesting manner, the fruit of his own extensive research, as well as the results of the labours of other scientific and historical students of language; while, as the Athenaeum says, 'his sober judgment and sound sense are barriers against the misleading influence of arbitrary hypotheses. 1 '' SYNONYMS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT. New Edition, enlarged. 8vo. cloth. \2s. The study of synonyms in any language is valuable as a discipline for training the mind to close and accurate habits op thought; more especially is this the case in Greek—'a language spoken by a people oj thefittest and subtlest intellect; who saw distinctions where others saw none; who divided out to different words what others often were content to huddle confusedly under a common term.' This work is recognized as a valuable companion to every student of the Nnu Testament in the original. This, the Seventh Edition, has been carefully revised, and a considerable number of new synonyms added. Appended is an Index to the synonyms, and an Index to many other words alluded to or explained throughout the work. 'He is,' the A thenaeum says, 'a guide in this department of kncnvledge to whom his readers 7nay entrust themselves with confidence.'

This, it is believed, was probably the first work which dreiv general attention in this country to the importance and interest of the critical and historical study of English. It still retains its place as one of the most successful if not the only exponent of those aspects of Words of which it treats. The subjects of the several Lectures are—/. 'Introductory ' II. 'On the Poetry of Words.' III. '' On the Morality of Words.' IV. '' On the History of Words.' V. 'On the Rise of Neiu Words.' VI. 'On the Distinction of Words.' VII. 'The Schoolmaster's Use of Words.'59 Trench (R. C.)— continued. ENGLISH PAST AND PRESENT. Eighth Edition, revised and improved. Fcap. 8vo. 4s. 6d. This is a series of eight Lectures, in the first of which Archbishop Trench considers the English language as it now is, decomposes some specimens of it, and thus discovers of what elements it is compact. In the second lecture he considers what the language might have been tf the Norman Conquest had never taken place. In the following six Lectures he institutes from various points of view a comparison between the present language and the past, points out gains which it has made, losses which it has endured, and generally calls attention to some of the more important changes through which it has passed, or is at present passing. A SELECT GLOSSARY OF ENGLISH WORDS USED FORMERLY IN SENSES DIFFERENT FROM THEIR PRESENT, Fourth Edition, Enlarged. Fcap. 8vo. 4^ 'This alphabetically arranged Glossary contains many of the most important of those English words which in the course of time have gradually changed their meanings. The author's object is to point out some of these changes, to suggest how many more thei-e may be, to show how slight and subtle, while, yet most real, these changes hare often been, to trace here and there the progressive steps by which the old meaning has been put off and the. new put on—the exact road which a word has travelled. The author thus hopes to render some assistance to those who regard this as a serviceable dis cipline in the training of their own minds or the minds of others. Although the book is in the form of a Glossary, it will be found as interesting as a seiies oj brief well-told biographies.

Crown 8vo. \l. is. Miss Yong/s work is acknowledged to be the authority on the interest ing subject of which it treats. Until she wrote on the subject, the history of names—especially Christian Names as distinguished from Surnames had been but little examined; nor why one should be popular and another forgotten—why one should flourish through out Europe, another in one country alone, another around some petty district. In each case she has tried to find out whence the name came, whether it had a patron, and whether the patron took it from the myths or heroes of his own country, or from the mean- in S C J the words. She has then tried to classify the names, as to treat them merely alphabetically would destroy all their interest and connection. They are classified first by language, beginning with Hebrezu and coming down through Greek and Latin to Celtic, Teutonic, Slavonic, and other sources, ancient and modern ; then by meaning or spirit.
