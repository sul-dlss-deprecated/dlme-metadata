My Lord, Aden, December 23, 1920. r . ^ HAVE the honour to forward for your Lordship’s information a copy of the Thirty-first Aden News Letter dated the 22nd December, 1920. I have, &amp;c. THP; following is a summary of the news reported since the despatch of my last letter dated the 8 th December, 1920:— News regarding Ibn Sand’s movements is conflicting. One report states that he has retired to Nejran, north of Saada, owing to sickness among his soldiers, while another states that he has received a large sum of money from the Imam for his retirement. A third report states that he is still fighting at A1 Kadad and A1 Haut, .and that the Dhu Mahomed and Dhu Hussain sub-tribes of the Bakhil have gone over [to the Idrisi or Ibn Sand and that Hashid tribe are wavering. According to an informant Saiyid Abdullah Ibrahim, referred to in previous letters, despatched 200 men to Al Udain and an equal number to Badan, for what purpose it is not clear. The party sent to Badan was attacked on arrival and suffered forty casualties in killed and wounded. Fighting is reported to have taken place between the Zeidis and the inhabitants of Ibb in consequence of suspected poisoning of a Zeidi officer. The head sheikh of Ibb, Abdu 8 alama, is said to have been made a prisoner along with 150 other suspects. A report says that Taiz is full of Zeidi troops and that although detachments are despatched towards Zabid they are replaced by fresh drafts from Sana. The concen- kadi) or to fix a subsidy for him. In the event of the Imam being unfriendly to us, the kadi offered to assist us in waging war against the Imam. The kadi does not appear to be a man of much importance. He may be an emissary of the Imam sent to sound us, or he may be an emissary from some enemy of the Imam. I have given him a reply in general terms that we desire to live on friendly terms with all the rulers of Arabia, great and small, but we consider ourselves bound by treaty to grant protection to the Amir of Dhala and to support the smaller chiefs to whom we are pledged. Two Turkish officers, Mustapha Azim and Tewfik Mahomed, who recent^ arrived here from the Yemen, gave the following information :— There are 60 military Turkish officers in the Yemen, 45 of whom are now employed by the Imam. There are, in addition, 30 civil Turkish officers employed under Mahmoud Nadhim, and 101 Turkish infantry soldiers and 45 artillerymen under the Imam. All Turkish officers and soldiers are employed solely for training purposes Three or four Turkish solders under Turkish officers are appointed to train 1. E. SCOTT, Major-General. Thirty-first Aden News Letter. Enclosure in No. 1 Yemen {Upper and Lower). \ tration at Taiz is said to be due to the fear the Zeidis still entertain of a British ' advance. Kadi Ahmed Mahomed-al-Ukam of Berut in the Yemen recently visited Aden and submitted a petition requesting me, in case the Imam was friendly to, or in alliance with, us, to write to him and ask him to confer a suitable post on him (the 100 Zeidi troops. There are 3,000 Imamic regulars at Sana, but thousands more are [5311 k—A]In the event of a jehad, the Imam can put 60,000 Rafik Bey has 2,000 regulars with him aTTafr ■ is not known. The Imam’s force at present in the surrounding country, regulars and irregul ars in addition to irregulars, whose number _ A — uu in Saafan, Jebel Bura and Jebel Keima consists of 500 regulars with an unknown number of irregulars. This force is officered by Arabs who have been educated trained in Constantinople, as the Imam will not trust Turkish officers to command h ? 3 men in actual warfare. There are a few irregulars at Mawia 1 he Imam has over 100 guns of all sizes in his fortress at Sahara. If he requires any guns for an exp^dllfoh they are always drawn from this fortress. r I he guns at Sana are never called upon, there are 15,000 rifles stored in this fortress. The guns at Sana, with the exception of the old immovable fortress guns, were given to the Imam by Mahomed Tewfiq, the late commander-in-chief of the 1 urkish forces : in the Yemen, before he could get permission to surrender. The guns at Taiz were given by Said Pasha to sheikh Mahomed Nasir Mukbil of Mawia. They were at Mawia until the Imam sent down a force of 300 Zeidis, which forced Mahomed Kasir.Mukbil to surrender them. There are also two mountain guns at Zabeed and two at-Wenakha. The Imam has guns posted all over the country. The Imam is not very anxious about the Idrisi, but was really anxious about Ibn 1 Saud. However, the latter advanced against Saada in such a foolish way and by so | difficult a road that,the number of casualties he suffered has .relieved the Imam’s 1 anxiety. Sickness broke out at Saada amongst Ibn Saud s men, and he has had to ! retire. In the opinion of the informants, with two aeroplanes and 10,000 men Ibn ISaud could have taken Sana in half-an-hour. ‘ The ammunition factory under the Austrian, George, is still turning out unlimited ammunition. The Commanding Royal Artillery at Sana is Lieutenant-Colonel Mahmoud Pasha. A lance-corporal of the 1st Yemen Infantry in Aden, who had proceeded on leave to the Yemen, reports that men who are known to have served in the 1st Yemen Infantry are fined from 50To 100*dollars, or in default have to suffer an imprisonment. Two deserters from the Yemen Infantry are said to be acting as informers and report the return o! the Yemen Infantry men. This same corporal states that while he was at Dhala on the 2nd December 600 Imamic soldiers entered the place and that another force ol 400 arrived at Kataba. On enquiry he learnt that these troops were sent for the invasion of the territory occupied by the Kotaibi, Haushabi and other tribes in the Aden Protectorate. The lance-corporal states that Ibb is full of troops and that the Zeidis have taken possession of all the arms, ammunition, &amp;c., which the people of Ibb had received from the Turks. r Adm Protectorate. According to a report 150 Zeidis have arrived at Dhala and more are expected. The Imam’s commander at Dhala intends to send a party of Zeidis to Al Agood and Radfan in the Aden Protectorate to enforce the payment of tithes, which the people of these places have refused. An informant from Dhala states that small parties of Zeidis have been arriving for the past week or so, and that all approaches to Dhala are held by piquets of these men. He says that 100 men of the Dhala garrison are armed with new Italian magazine rifles. A party of Mansuris and Makhdumis (Subehis) in our protectorate is reported to have raided the Somati section of the Subehis and carried away thirty-one camels after killing two Somatis. This raid appears to be in retaliation for a raid made by the Somatis some time ago, in which they had killed one Mansuri and one Makhdumi an carried away a flock of sheep and goats. The Abdali Sultan is trying to settle the dispute. ^ Mukbil Abdulla, referred to in the last letter, is now reported to have gone to i Dhala, and I hear that he will not be permitted to leave until he has placed his son as a hostage. ■ . I The Imam’s commander at Dhala is said to have tom-tomed a notice to the enec that all goods should pass through Dhala, where transit dues will be levied, and a goods going by other routes will be confiscated. , T.

Enclosure in No. 1 . Twenty-eitfkdi Aden News Letter. I THE following is a summary of the news reported since the despatch of my last letter dated the 12 th November, 1920. Tihama .—The Political Officer, Hodeida, writes that the Italians who visited Khokha and Hais last September were Signor Fazzi, a merchant of Massowah and his accountant. During their visit they are said to have offered to repair the Turkish court house at Hals and also to supply new telegraph apparatus. The offer was, however, declined both by the Sheikh and the Mansab. The Italians returned to Assab with two dhows laden with skins and coffee. They appear to have given up the idea of starting trade with Khokha as Signor Fazzi is reported to have stated on his return to Massowah that it was unsafe at present as the people were hostile to Europeans. This report is confirmed by the Political Officer, Hodeida, who states that the sheikh and the Mansab have told the people of Khokha not to allow any Italians to land again. It is further reported that the people are opposed to entering into trade transactions with Italians, as although their goods are inferior in quality and very expensive they refuse to trade except on cash terms. The Political Officer, Hodeida., reports that the Italian ship “ Nilo” referred to in my last letter, called at Hodeida on the 1 st November, 1920, and left for Massowah on the 4 th. The Italians whose names appear to be Fattigatti (not Fidioti or Nidiotti) and Rossi, stated that they had visited Port Soudan, Jeddah, Qunfidah, Jizan and Kamaran, and that their business was to inquire into the facilities for trade with the Yemen ports. They did not seem to be satisfied with the result of their inspection. Signor Fattigatti is said to represent the firm of Pampurri and Martini, and Signor Rossi is an independent merchant. The former, who was born and educated in Turkey, has been in Massowah for many years. The Political Officer states that Signor Fattigatti intends to start business in Hodeida, where he has engaged a house. Signor Rossi tried to secure a cargo of coffee for Egypt, but failed. The “ Nilo ” left Hodeida with a small consignment of senna leaves, skins and coffee for Massowah from Signor Pardo, an Italian merchant at Hodeida. The ship is expected back about the end of this month. Mahomed Amin, the principal Sheikh of Jebel Reima, has submitted to the Political Officer, Hodeida, a petition, which I am forwarding officially. He requests that we should make both the Imam and the Idrisi withdraw to their respective frontiers and thus prevent bloodshed and plunder until a settlement about his country is reached. The sheikh visited Hodeida on the 3rd instant, stating that he wished to stay in Hodeida till the future of his country was settled, but he has since left for Massowah in the Italian ship “ Nilo.” He was accompanied by Kadi Hamood Harazi, the ex-Mudir of Saafan. The object of their visit to Massowah is not known. Signor Fattigatti is said to have offered them free passage. The Military Administrator, Hodeida, has sent me copies of two letters written by Mahmud Nadhim, the ex-Vali of the Yemen, to the Sheikh of Jebel Reima and Kadi [5096 x —1]2 Hamood-al-Harazi, mentioned in the foregoing paragraph. The letters, which wer apparently received after the addressees had left for Massowah, have been entrusted to Signor Pardo, the Italian merchant at Hodeida, for delivery. Signor Pardo showed J the letters privately to the Political Officer and copies were taken. The original will be delivered to the addressees on their return from Massowah. ' ^ In the letter to the Sheikh of Jebel Reima, the ex-Vali refers to the sheikh’s letter* of the 19th October, and states that he was grieved to hear what had befallen him He chides the sheikh for not informing him of his grievances and declares that he could have got redress at once from the Imam. The ex-Vali states that he has been sent bv the Imam to suppress intrigues, issue safe conduct and stop bloodshed among Mussul mans. He c laims t he Yemen as a Turkish province and declares that the Imam is the prop of the Government, who h ascon l immd iaithfu 1 to his pact with the Turks The Vali asks how he can forsake the Imam and join the friends of Christians. ' He further claims that the Taiz district is faithful to the Imam as the great and solid friend of the Turkish Government, that no foreign troops are maintained there but a corps of local men has been formed under a Turkish kaimakam, Rafiq Hey and other officers. He finally presses the Sheikh of Reima to make his submission'and guarantees his safety. In the letter to Kadi Hamood-al-Harazi, the ex-Vali refers to the former’s two letters and assures him that he has not struck his name off the list of Turkish officials hut still considers him to be the Mudir of Saafan. Referring to a sum of 25,000L, which the Kadi appears to have stated in his letters | that the ex-Vali had received through the American consul, the ex-Vali states that i though he asked for the amount he had received no reply. He wants the Kadi to { make enquiries regarding the money and to inform him immediately of the result, assuring | the Kadi that he will receive his share. This has reference to the ex-Vali’s request for money for the relief of Turkish families in the Yemen, made through the American consul at Aden. The request was forwarded by the latter to his Government, but he has had no reply. . 7}' e Z eic h s appear to be still in Saafan. Reports from Hodeida state that the Zeidis attempt to capture the fort of A1 Hadi in Beni Jurain was unsuccessful. The ex-Vali is said to have wired to the Iman asking for reinforcement for the capture of the fort. Hodeida merchants are said to continue to correspond with the Imam. Mirjan Haraji and others are reported to have written to the Imam asking for the grant of full amnesty to Sheikh Abdulla Bishr of Saafan, and for the restoration of his property. . y ie ^f^®d agent of the Political Officer, Hodeida, reports that Awwad Ali, the ei o Rikb, has made his submission to the Imam after having received guarantee for protection of his rights. The agent says that the Imamic flag has been hoisted on the court-house at 'a ee , and that the Amil has received orders to build barracks for soldiers and also three large halls as additions to the court-house. The cost of building is estimated at 15,000 dollars. ^ t?

The skeikhs have called a meeting to discuss the matter, and have invited the Sheikh of Jerabih to preside. J ne mam is reported to have despatched a large force to Jebel Milhan under the command of Raghib Bey, ex-Mutessarif of Hodeida. It is reporter! that Arab leaders at Hodeida have sent letters to the notables of oana, Zabeed and other important towns stating that they have been appointed repre sen a I'ves o t le Aiahs throughout the Yemen, and that this news has been received by the people with contempt. i- A f eid i. force attacked and captured Beni Tulaili in Jebel Reima.

He is constantly moving between Ibb, Taiz, Yerim and A1 Gened. They all anticipate a ( British advance, and are showing much activity. They are said to have posted three guns at Taiz to shoot down our aeroplanes. The Sana agent of the Political Officer, Hodeida, states that Saiyid Abdulla Ibrahim is touring to raise a force against Ibn Saud, and that he is expected to visit Dala via Kataba. This agent further states that an Imamic mission sent to Saada has been detained there by Sayid Abu Neb, and that the Imam has proceeded to Ptada in order to collect troops to attack Abu Neb. The agent says that before his departure to Bada the Imam called a meeting of the people and besought them with tears in his eyes to defend their faith and country against the aggression of the supporters of the infidels. His words and tears aroused the sympathy of the audience, who responded with cries “We are ready to give our lives and property in the cause of our religion and country.” The Imam is said to have refused Mahmud Nadhim’s request to send Turkish soldiers to Menakha. Aden Protectorate. —Our Intelligence Agent at Dala reports that a rumour to the effect that the British force at Nohat Dakim had received some aeroplanes, caused something like a panic among the Zeidis at Dala. The same agent says that Saiyid Yahya recently appointed two officials for the assessment of tithes. This has given rise to dissatisfaccion amongst the local tribesmen. The agent visited Mausatta in September last. He states that the Naqibs have at their disposal a tribal force of about 1,000 to 1,200 men for the defence of their boundaries against Imamic aggression. The two petty Upper Yafa sheikhs who had gone to Dala to negotiate for the release of prisoners are now reported to have returned, having failed to attain their object. The Lower Yafa Sultan, Ibn Afif, is reported to have made a pact with the Rasasi Sultan of Beda to drive the Zaidis out of Dala. The Lower Yafa Sultan, says an informant, can raise a force of 800 men with little difficulty. Trouble is said to be brewing between the Lower Yafa and the Fadli tribes over the possession of Husn Hilma, which is still in the hands of the latter (please see news letter dated the 13th August, 1920). The departure of Saiyid Mahomed Shami referred to in my last letter from Dala is confirmed. One report states that he deserted, while another states that he left with the knowledge of the Imam’s commander, and that he has taken with him sixteen mules laden with rifle and gun ammunition, and that there are only six mules and four boxes of ammunition now left in Dala. Saif Abdulla, a Shafai sheikh of the Ibb district, is reported to have arrived at Dala on the *_ 9 th October with 400 men, 200 of whom are Zaidis and the remainder Shafais from Ba’adan. I have so far received no confirmation of this report. The Imam’s commander at Dala Saiyid Yahya is said to have enlisted 300 Shairis (Amins) for local service 5 240 men, of whom 50 are from Jalela and 190 from Waara (Amiri), are said to have been sent to Sana under Naqib Maasar. Ihese reports are not confirmed. A traveller from Rada states that he saw at Damar 800 men of whom 500 were Zaidis and the remainder local men. He heard that they were going to Dala to relieve the present garrison which w T as much reduced by sickness. The commander at Dala is reported to have taken an additional hostage from each of the Shairi sheikhs, and from Muqbil Abdulla (Kotaibi). The Alawi sheikh, Abdul Nabi, has given his son, Mohsin, as a hostage to tbe Zaidis. The Kotaibis under Muqbil Abdulla said to have sought the help of the Zaidis against the Dhambari tribe, with whom they are at feud. The commander at Dala promised the desired assistance, but on learning that Mohamed Saleh-al-Akram, the Kotaibi sheikh had received ammunition from Aden, he withdrew his assistance and put Muqbil Abdullas hostages in chains.

Political Resident, Aden, to Earl Carzon,—(Received December 21.) (No. 58.) My Lord, Aden, December 8 , 1920. I HAVE the honour to forward, for your Lordship’s information, a copy of the 30th Aden News Letter, dated the 8 th December, 1920. I have, &amp;c. , T. E. SCOTT, Major-General. Enclosure in No. 1 . Thirtieth Aden News Letter. THE following is a summary of the news reported since the despatch of my last letter, dated the 26th November. 1920 :— Tihama. — It appears from reports received from Hodeida that the Imam has concentrated a big force at Jebel Reima. The remnant of the old force is said to have asked the ex-Vali, Mahmud Nadhim, to relieve them, as they are war-worn. The Vali has forwarded their request to the Imam and asked them to remain at their posts pending receipt of the Imam’s reply, but a party of 400 men is said to have deserted with war spoils. A report says that in compliance with the ex-Vali’s request, the Imam ordered 500 Zeidis to proceed to Menekha. The latter, however, refused to go and offered armed resistance. There is said to be a reserve force of 2,000 men at Sana and Rada, which will be shortly despatched to the Tihama. In my letter of the 14th October last, I reported the death of the Aboos Sheikh and the election of his nephew, Salim Bukheit, as his successor. The latter is now reported to have been elected sheikh of the whole tribe in consequence of the death of Sahel Ali, the other sheikh of the tribe. Until the death of this sheikh the tribe was divided into two sections under the rival sheikhs, Suleiman Hassan Bukheit, who was succeeded by his nephew, Salim Bukheit, and Sahel Ali. The Sana agent of the Political Officer, Hodeida, states that Saiyid Abdulla-bin- Ibrahim, referred to in previous letters, has been deputed by the Imam as inspector of the Wakfs of Zabeed and Khoka, and superintendent of the Public Treasury of the Qadhas of Zabeed, Hais and Jebel Ras. The Imam is reported to have sent one big gun to Zabeed and another to Dhala. The Zabeed agent of the Political Officer, Hodeida, reports that a notable of Udain, Hamid-bin-Ali Pasha, has tendered for the lease of the revenues of Zabeed, Hais and Jebel Ras for a sum of 450,000 dollars annually. This bid is said to exceed the actual revenues of the places mentioned by 300,000 dollars, and if it is accepted by the Imam, the result will be heavy exactions from the people and consequent discontent. The same agent states that he has no fresh news about Italian activity at Khoka beyond the fact that their agent named Shakoor is staying at Khoka. The Zabeed agent says that Shakoor is trying to purchase houses for the Italians. From a later report received from the Zabeed agent, it appears that Shakoor has made an agreement with the Imam on behalf of the Italians, by which the Imam promises to receive and protect all Italian goods imported into this country via Khoka. The Italians in return promise to supply the Imam with telephone and telegraph apparatus, shell and cartridge-making apparatus, waggons, firearms and other war materials. The _ agerTt'T^ports that the Italians have sent to Khoka animals, carpets and cloth which they are trying to exchange for coffee and skins, and that the Italian merchant referred to in my last letter is expected at Khoka by a special steamer. It is said that the Imamic inspector at Zabeed will proceed to Khoka to meet him. Signor Pardo, an Italian merchant at Hodeida, confirms the news of this expected [5096 x — 2 ]2 arrival of the Italian at Khoka, who, he says, will reside there. Signor Pardo infom a the Political Officer, Hodeida, that the Sheikh of Jebel Reima and Quzi Hamoodal Harazi referred to in the last letter have gone from Massowah to Asmara to intended the Italian Governor there. According to later reports from H&lt;&gt;deida, the Zeidis re-attacked the fort ' “ Al-Hadi ” on the 15th November. After a struggle lasting for five hours, they w-^ forced to retire leaving thirty men killed and five wounded. Heavy fighting is also reported in Jebel Reima, where the Idrisi appears to have concentrated a large force The strength of the Imam’s force in Jebel Reima is said to be 3,000. One of the Idrisi officials is said to have stated that unless the Hodeida merchants cease taking part in the Hodeida administration and stop their intrigues with Saiyids and recognise the Idrisi as their only ruler after the evacuation of Hodeida by the British, the Quhras and Aboos will be obliged to make a raid on Hodeida. In a later report the Sana agent of the Political Officer, Hodeida, states that owing to the approach of Ibn Saud’s armv to his borders at Shahara, Abu Naib has been obliged to make peace with the Imam and to release the Imamic mission detained by him. He has, however, obtained concessions whereby the Imam removed customs houses from his territories and stopped the practice of drinking, singing and other acts which are contrary to the Sheria, and which the Turks had introduced. This report contradicts the former report that Abu Naib was co-operating with Ibn Saud and is, I think, the more worthy of credence. The Zeidi tribesmen are reported to have complied with the Imam’s latest request for 5,000 fighting men on condition that they serve under their own leaders, and are permitted to return home after the conclusion of the particular campaign for which their services are required. This force is expected to advance on the Tihama on the 10 th December. The ex-Yali is reported to have informed the Imam that he has failed in his anti-Idrisi campaign, and that the only possible remedy now left is to despatch a laro-e force to the Tihama. These reports, combined with a report received from H.M.S. “Clematis” that the Idrisi and Saved Mustafa were busy mustering troops during his recent visit to Midi, lead me to anticipate heavy fighting between the Idrisi and the Imam in the near future. Yemen (Upper and Lower). A Haushabi Akil lately reported to the officer commanding troops at Nobat Dakim that the Amil of Taiz, Saiyid Abdullah-al-Wazir, had arrived at Ibb on the 5th November with 2 guns, 2 machine guns, 7 camel loads of ammunition, 50 horses,. 40 mules, 150 donkeys, and a large body of soldiers. The Akil also reported that the Haushabi Sultan had received a letter on receipt of which the latter collected 200 men and proceeded to Ad Dareja. The Akil states that the real intention of the Haushabi ^as to meet the Zeidis either at Ad Dareja or Mawia, though he gave out that he was going to the Amiri country. The real object of Saiyid Abdulla-al-Wazir’s visit to Ibb appears to be to disarm the populace, who are in possession of a very large number of rifles and a large quantity of ammunition, which they received from the Turks during the war and prior to the e\acuation of Turkish troops. No news confirming the Haushabi’s visit to the Zeidis has been received. The Haushabi Sultan, who is one of our protectorate chiefs, has hitherto refused to comply with the Zeidi Amil’s frequent invitations to visit Mawia. An informant from Sana states that Ibn Saud’s forces are at Sada and are armed | with luikish and German rifles, and that Ibn Saud has recently come in possession of F twenty-five Turkish field guns, which he captured from Ibn Aidh of Ebha. This news appears to be mere town gossip, although our Sana correspondent confirms the report of the presence of Ibn ^aud s troops near Shahara, and adds that the Imamic troops directed to march against them refused to fight. The same informant states that Saiyid ^Abdullah Ibrahim referred to in previous letters has gone to Zabeed from Taiz with 2 00 men to fight the Idrisi. This infor- mant confirms the report of the arrival of Saiyid Abdullah-al-Wazir at Ibb with men, guns, &amp;c., and states that he has dismissed all the old clerks who have been serving continuously from the time of the Turks, and has sent them to Sana. The same informant also states that the Imam has deputed Mahmud Nadhim to arrange peace with the Idrisi. The people of Ibb and Baadan are reported to have assumed a threatenur#attitude towards Ibn-al-Wazir, the Amil of Taiz, who has gone to those places to disarm the people. Reports have been received from which it appears that the ex-Vali Mahmud Nadhim is being congratulated by his Arab friends on his promotion to the high rank i of Vazir It is not clear whether this is a part of the Vali’s propaganda or whether he ^as been appointed by the Imam as his Vazir. The Sana agent states that most of the Turks in the Yemen are anxious to leave the country, but that they are afraid of applying for permission, which they know *he Imam will not grant. The same agent reports the arrival of a Turkish officer named Hassan Gendari, alias Bimbashi Hassan Effendi, from Constantinople. The agent says that he went to Sana j via Aden, and has brought letters for the Turks in the Yemen. His statemen: regarding jj the present condition of Turkey contradicted Mahmud Nadhim’s propaganda to some extent. Bimhashi Hassan is said to have stated that the party of Turkish patriots at Constantinople was in alliance with the British, and that the Khalifat had been transferred to the Arabs. The latter news is said to have caused hitter feelings among the people, who suspect the Bimbashi of being a Turkish spy. This man subsequently went to Hodeida on his way back to Constantinople. The Arab leaders of Hodeida are said to have had a private interview with him. They told I him that they were doing their best for the return of the Turks to the Yemen, and that j Turkey should not hesitate to return should the Powers ask her to do so. \ from Hodeida Hassan Mahomed Effendi came to Aden and left for Beyrouth via ou Ih® 28th ultimo by the Italian steamer “ Porto-di-Savona.” His passport has been endorsed lor Beyrouth by the French consul here and vised by this office. Hassan Mahomed Effendi is a native of Sana. According to his own statement, he left the Yemen with the Turks after tlie Armistice and went to Egypt. He subse quently resigned his commission, and from Egypt he went to Beyrouth and thence to Constantinople. A year and a-half ago he left Constantinople and returned to Beyrouth. In September last he left for Mecca on a pilgrimage via Port Said and Massowah, but as he did not find pilgrims at the latter place he came to Aden, arriving here on the 10 th October and left for Sana. His object in going to Sana was to dispose of some goods he had left there. His family is in Beyrouth and he is now going to rejoin them. From enquiries made locally it appears that the family of Hassan Mahomed Effendi is in Sana and that he had go$e there to see them. He is reported to be a Turkish propagandist. He was watched during his stay in Aden, but nothing suspicious was noticed. Aden Protectorate .—Travellers from Dhala report that the Imam’s commander, Saiyid Yahya, has written to Syed Abdulla, at Yerim, asking him to send his cousin, Syed Kasim of Nadora, to Dhala to relieve him, as he is very ill and wishes to return home. A later report states that Saiyid Kassim, the present Hakim of Nadera and father-in-law of Saiyid Yaliya, is coming lo relieve the latter by orders of the Imam. The travellers also report the arrival of 12 Zeidis at Dhala. They say that there are altogether about 100 Zeidis in Dhala, but t at 50 of them are sick. Later arrivals state that before they left Dhala they heard a rumour that 600 Zeidis with 3 guns were on their way to Dhala, but that they are at present detained at Ibb owing to the trouble there. It is said that this reinforcement is being sent to Dhala at the request of Saiyid Yahya, the Imams commander, who complained to the Imam th &gt; he was unable to enforce his orders without additional troops. The Imam’s commander at Dhala is said to he annoyed with Mukbil Abdulla, the nephew of the Koteibi Sheikh, because the latter paid a visit to the Amir of L)hala at Lahej. It is said that the commander sent for Mukbil Abdulla, but he has not gone for fear of being punished. The commander is also said to be annoyed with the Alawi Sheikh for ill-treating travellers and slighting the commander’s name when invoked by the travellers. Dhala and Kataba revenue is reported to have been leased to one Saiyid Husen-al- Rawia for an annual sum of 10,000 dollars. Letters are said to have been sent by the Imam’s commauder at Dhala to the Fadli Sultan and to some of the more important Fadli Sheikhs. I await confirmation of this report. T. E.

ADKM RJJilDEUCy, l£th Scvenber , 1920. The following is a summary of the news reported since the despatch of my last letter dated 29th October received a letter from Mahmud Nadhim, the ex-Vali of the Yemen, in which he offers to act as mediator between sidered the exMali's action entirely mischievous and that he (the Xdrisi ) did not propose to send any reply. The Idrlsi has received letters from two of the Imam's sons and from a learned man named Salyid Mohamed All, containing overtures for peace. It would appear that Mahmud Nadhim(a move to Menakha is connected with this peace movement, but that he is playing a double game. as he did during the negotiations for the release of the 'Jacob' Mission. I await Captain Fazluddin's report as to the attitude of the Idrisl in the matter of the letters hive received a reply to his letter to the Tihama 1920. TIHA.1A. Captain r’azluddin writes that the Idrlsi has him and the Imam in his capacity as the Turkish '. ali of the Yemen and in the name of the Turkish from the Imam’s sonse Mahmud Nadhim is still at Menakha and is said to Sheikhs/Sheikhs and Sheikh Mohamed Tahir (the Idrisi Commandant at Bajil) which he has forwarded to the Imam, with whom he is said to he in daily telegraphic communica tion* The contents of this reply are not kn wn* Saiyld Abdul Kactir al Ahdal, the chief Lfansab of iiarawa, sent the letter he received from Mahmud Nadhiri to the Idrisi who has replied to- him pointing out that Mahmud Nadhim represents a Government which does not exist in the Yeman and which has given up all its rights in it« The Idrisi reminds ^aiyid Abdul Kadir of the circumstances which led him (the Idrisi) to send his troops to the Tihama. The number of troops at Menakha is estimated at 600 soldiers with 2 guns. There are also 30 Turkish officials. Mahmud Nadhim is said to be trying to impress | upon people that an attack in force will be made on Tihama shortly, in which all Turkish officers and soldiers tin Sana will take part. The Imam is reported to have written again to the Saiyids and Sheikhs of the Tihama, asking them to take his advice and not to resist him and warning them of serious consequences in the event of their failure to act on his instructions. At the same time he has written to the ex-Vali and Saiyid Abbas, the Amil of Saafan asking them not to advance until they receive orders from him. A report says that the Imam has given orders to Sheikh All Mikdad of Anis to send a reinforcement of 1,000 men to Jabel Reima, while another report states 4 that Sheikh All Mikd&amp;d has gone over to Abu Neb, a rela tive of the Imam, who is co-operating with Ibn Baud's army near Sada. The/The Idriel appears to be making progress in Jabel Reima where he has garrisoned all important posi tions captured by him with his own troops from Asir. The Political Officer, Hodeida, states that no fresh reports have been received of Italian activity in Khokha or of the landing of more goods there. In connection with the landing of Italians at Khokha, it is reported that the ImaM** Amil at 2abeed summoned the Amil of Hais to explain his relations with the Italians. r ihe latter refused to obey and reported the matter to the Imam who Is said to have ordered the Zabeed Amil not to interfere. The people of Jebel Ras, which is near Hais, petitioned the Imam asking for the removal of their Amil whom they accused of tyranny. The Amil of ftasab A1 All, Saiyid H&amp;sbami, has proceeded to Jabel Has to in- quire into the complaint. With reference to the Idrisi reverses in the Tihama, reported by me last month. Captain Fazluddin writes that owing to a night attack by the Iman^s troops the Idrisi Jaish had to retire from some of the posts in Saafan but that the places have been re-occupied. Captain Fazluddin says that the reverse sustained by the Idrisi in Reima just about the same time was more serious than that at Saafan, but that the situation there has considerably improved. Jabl, the chief centre of the Feima Kadha, is closely invested by tjie Idrisi, while a portion of his army is in occupation of Jun^a. Captain Fazluddin states that the excitement in the Tihama in September and October was not due to these reverses but to the coining of the ex-Vali, Mahmud iadhirn/Nadhim, to Menakbft and the starting of his propaganda. Since the beginning of October the Imam has sustained a severe defeat at Malhan losing five fortified strong holds, one Naclb and $8 men killed, more than 50 men wounded and one gun, which was shattered. The Idrises loss was 5 men killed and 20 wounded* In consequence of thiss reverse, the Imamlo &amp;aqdaml has been recalled to Sana. Captain Fasluddin says that according to the latest news received from Mahomed Tahir, the Idrlai Commandant at Bajil, the Arab force collected by Mahmud Hadhlm has dispersed, while his Turkish troops are un willing to fight. The Idrisl has absolutely no fear of Buraa or Bajil being attacked by the Imam, nor has his Command t at Bajil expressed any anxiety. The Idrisi is, however, taking steps to reinforce his army at Bajil and its environments, not to meet Mahmud iiadhim’s force, about which he does not entertain the slightest fear, but to counteract the pernicious effects of the latter’s mis chievous propaganda, which the Idrisi fears might turn Ith heads of the misguided and self-centred Mansabs of (Marawa and Munira on whose co-operation in the future pMahmud Nadhim mostly counts. YEABU (Upper and Lower) . The Menakha agent of the Political Officer, Hodeida, reports that the village of hasabah in the district of Jeharan was attacked by 5000 Zeidls in consequence of the refusal of the Bheikh of the placeJ to supply men to the Imam. After many excesses had been committed, the Zaidis marched on Jabel Reima. The number of attackers is obviously exasperated. T e Zaidi ammunition is reported to be deterio- ratlnp. The cause for this is said to be that cartridge cases are refilled more than once with the result that they burst in the rifle. The quality of the powder now manufactured is said to be bad. It has ruined the rifles In which it has been used and lessened their effective range by almost half. In my last letter I referred to the reported arrival of the Imam’s Wazir at Ibb, haiyid Abdulla ibn Ibrahim. An informant says that this man has never been known to leave Sana before. .'bile at Yarim the Informant paid his respects to him and asked him where he was going;. Saiyid Abdulla told him that he was going to Taiz. The informant subsequently learnt from some of his Zaidi ijsoldiers that he was going as an envoy of the Imam to the lEngliah and from others that he was going to relieve Ibn El ^azir, the Imam’s Amil at Taiz, as numerous complaints had been made against the latter by the local inhabitants. Another informant states that the Wazir’e visit to Ibb is in connection with the repairs of a Turkish aqueduct. ie has completed the work as far as El Gened which is midway between Taiz and Ibb. I have received no information of the approach of any Imamlc representative to renew relations with this Residency and I attach no importance to this report. Jiiaiyi Abdulla Ibrahim is a descendant of foner Ima s# He is in ex-member of the Turkish Parliament and is said to be very influential. Travellers/forces, lately much Increased by new adherents, are now at tada ( and Kokaban, and are within £ days of Shahara and £ana*Abu Neb, an ex-aspirant to the Imamshi., is in alliance with Ibn Saud and is fighting the Imamie troops at Jabel Norn, This news has not been confirmed by Captain Pazluddin. ( Reports of an impending attack by Ibn Saud on Sana and Shahara aro continuous. Accordinp to‘Captain Pazluddin the Wahabi army marched north after taking Rbha, but a new army may have appeared. I am asking Captain Fazluddin for information on this point. A traveller from Mavia reports that the Imam’s Anil at Taiz summoned the local Sheikhs of yiavia and demanded from each 50 men to serve in the Imam’s army. The Sheikhs, who refused to comply with the demand, were put in prison and have been told that they will be kept there until they have completed the num ber demanded. The same Informant states that Ibn fcl Warith,the Amil - at iavia, has been relieved by Laid Mahomed El Amir from Lana and that Lheikh lahomed Nasir Mukbil of La via has been appointed his lieutenant. From another source it Is reported that the Imam has assigned ^ 1,000/- per mensem to £heikh Mahon d Nasir Mukbll o t of the taxes collected in his ooun ry. Travellers’ reports of concentration of Imam’s troops at Ibb, Taiz, etc., are continuous, but one of our seer t agents, who lately visited th se places states that no troops beyond the usual parrlaone have arrived. ash: . Captain Fazluddin reports that a party of Europeans landed on the Island of Saqid, one of the Farsan group, from an unknown ship, on the 19th October last. I suspect that/that the party referred to is from H.,M• ti. ' CCh NJ'XXj &gt;/1 h ' which is at present employed on the Red Sea Patrol. Captain Fazluddin also reports the arrival of an Italian merchant vessel 'NILAU' (The Mle) at Jlzan on the 26th idem, with the object of securing an oil con cession on the Farsan Islands. Two Italians, one the Captain of the ship and the other an old man aped about 70 years named i.Fidlott,i or Kidiotti, a merch nt of aassaweh. landed and saw Syed i/iustafa. They had a Somali in terpreter with them but could themselves speak intelligible Arabic. i:tey said that they belonged to the Massawah merchant community and were returning from Jeddah. They produced a letter from an Arab merchant of Masaawah* to t e address of iheikh Mahomed Sharawi, the chief Sheikh of Farsan, recommending them to his attention at Farsan and requesting him to introduce them to th Idrisi, if necessary. Fyed Mustafa after reading the letter remarked that it could not help them at Farsan, as the Sheikh would not permit them to land without the Idris1*8 permission. They expressed a desire to see the Idrisi as they wanted to discuss some mercantile matters. 'In reply to Syed Mustafa they said that they were acting at the instance of their Government. Syed Mustafa after seeing the Idrisi told them that he was unable to see them as he was busy. They told ^yed Mustafa that they wanted to go to the Farsan Island to see the oil mines before approaching th Idrisi -ith offers for working them. Syed Justafa told them that as the Turkish peace had not yet ‘been finally settled, the Idrisi considered it inadvisable to discuss the question of the Farsan oil mines. The Italians/Italians then re-embarked and left Jizan. ADaif PROThCTQRATk. The Naqlbs of Hausatta write that they have unanimously decided to proceed against the Zaidis in Shaib to turn them out of their country. They acftln pra88 for Bn advan&lt;je ^ ^ part, and ask that in the event of our not doing they may be furnished with the necessary equipment. I have sent them a suitable reply. A quarrel is reported between the Ima m ' s Hakim at itala, ■ aiyid Yahia, and his assistant, oaiyid Mahomed Ash-Shami, over the accounts which the Imam has asked iiaiyid Yahia to adjust. iiaiyid Ash-Shami with 2 petty mucoadams and 60 Zaidis is said to have left for his country. Reports continue to come in of the prevalence of sick ness among the Zaidis in Dala. The mortality is said to be about 10 daily. The Rijai section of the Subehi tribe recently inter cepted a kat caravan and carried away some kat. The kat owners are British subjects. The Abdali has been requested to deal with the marauders as he is responsible for the safety of the trade routes in the Subehi country. On the 3rd.November two Kotalbis looted some cattle from the Dambari country. Three Dambarls followed and over, took them near the Alawi boundary but the Kotaibis opened fire and killed two of the Jlambarin. The Dam ari tribesmen are said to be collecting to start a counter raid on the Kotaibis• It is reported that the Attifis (Subehis) have carried •way 4 camels belonging to certain Abdali subjects.

The notables sent a reply, which though couched in friendly terms, repudiated the claim of the Quhras and hboos to be sole owners of Hodeida # A report says that the Imam has ^xenpted the Sayidc of Eabeed, who petitioned him, from the payment of tithes. YEI4EH (Upper and Lower) The visit of the Imam’s son to Mavia and Taiz, referred to in my last letter, is said to be in connection ^ith a scheme for recruiting Shaf&amp;l soldi 3*8.

YMEN (Upper &amp; Lower ) According to the report of a traveller from Mavia one of the Imam's sons has arrived at Ibb and is expected at Taiz to which place he will go via Mavia accompanied by 600 men. A number of Sheikhs and Akils of Mavia have been invited to meet him. This news is confirmed by Sheikh Mahomed Nasir Mukbil of Mavia in a letter to the Haushabi Sultan. | The news of the Imam’s death reported last week is I not confirmed. This week’s reports, however, state that he is very ill at Rada. All leave to the Imamic troops at Taiz, Mavia and Dhala is said to have been stopped by order of the Imam. The Arail at Dhala is reported to be paying the Zaidi soldiers a portion of their arrears of poy in an attempt to put a stop to the frequent desertions. Reports of Zaidi feeling point to their entertaining an altogether exaggerated idea of our strength at iobat Dakim, where they think we have aeroplanes. ADEN PROTECTORATE. There has been no change in uhe situation. Dild rumours/ The Right Honourable Earl Ourzon of Kedleston, K.G. etc., etc., etc. His Majesty’s Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, LOUDON.rumours of Zaidi advance on Nobat Dakim and Lahej are, however current. Our Upper Yaffa correspondent states that these rumours as well as those about the arrival of reinforcements at Dhala have been started by the Zaidis to deceive us. Reports of the prevelance of an epidemic disease among the Zaidis continue to come in, but its nature is still unknown. Numbers are said to be dying daily. Sheikh Abdu Nabi, the newly elected Chief of the Alawi tribe, returned from his visit to the Imam’s Amil at Dhala, Saiyid Yahia, and has addressed a letter to this Residency giving his impressions of the Zaidi regime in Dhala but care fully avoiding mention of what passed between him and the Amil. He says that Saiyid Yahia, the Amil at Dhala, is mentioned in the daily prayers by the people at Dhala. The state of the country is prosperous and that the Zaidis have no difficulty in collecting their taxes which are paid to the Amil by the Shaikhs of villages, without the intervention of tax collectors. Sheikh Abdul Nabi says that he had received an invitation from the Amil to come to Dhala and he went, as to decline would mean bringing trouble on himself and his country. At the same time he professes his firm loyalty to us and says he is anxiously looking forward to the day when the British Protectorate will be rid of the Zaidis and urges an early advance on Dhala* The Officer Commanding troops at Nobat Dakim has received a letter from one of the Nakibs of Mausatta again pressing for the advance of our troops to Dhala. He says that the Zaidis are exacting heavy taxes and all the tribes would be glad to see the last of them. The Upper Yafa petty Sheikhs referred to in my letter of 17th September 1920 are reported to be still in Dhala negotiating for the release of prisoners. The Muflahi Shaikh of Upper Yafa is at present in Aden to urge on me the desirability of an early advance on I Dh ala, in which he says all the Yafa Shaikhs and Sultans will co-operate/-3- ^ ' o U/ IU^ co-operate v;ith us. The iluflahi 'brings with him letters of recommendation from the Naqibs of Mausatta and Saleh bin Umer, Sultan of the Upper Yafa. The Muflahi explains the extreme eagerness of himself and other Yafa Chiefs to see that Zaidis out of Dhala and the Shairi and Shaibi territories occupied by them, by saying that they have deprived him of his revenues from certian villages in these territories. They feel themselves strong enough to resist further Zaidi agression, but not sufficiently powerful to take the offensive. MISCELLAHEOUS . 393 returning Yemen pilgrims in an entirely destitute and helpless condition were dumped down at Kamaran last month by pilgrim ships from Jeddah. One of these ships was carrying 1324 pilgrims many of whom were dying of starvation on account of the shortage of food on board. The Military Administrator, Kamaran reports that owing to the extreme shortage of food in the island the dumping of these pilgrims caused the utmost trouble. The British Agent, Jeddah, who was requested by tele graph to see that no such pilgrims were sent to Kamaran where food supplies were scarce and means of onward despatch were wanting, points out that as the quarantine arrangements this year are quite outside the control of the Britisn authorities at Jeddah, tnere is no means by which they can check the embarkation of any particular class of pilgrims, or notify the autnoribies at Kamaran in time for arrangements to be made. Hodeida reports that I'ahmud ITadhim’ s pro-Turkish ’.propaganda still continues and is receiving the support of the Imam who has informed the tribes of the Tehama t.nat the ex- T ali is their lawful Governor and that his own forces and money are at the Vali’s disposal. Zaidi tribesmen are mustering at SANAA and Zaidi reinforcements have reached SAAFAN but on the other hand 1000 Q,UKRA/Q/JHRA, ABOOS and JERABEH tribesraen have joined the Idrisi and are reported to have marched to HUJAILEH, where they are awaiting the arrival of other reinforcements before attaching the Zaidia /* at SAAFAN. It appears from this that Mahmud Madhim’s propaganda has not yet made much progress in the Tehama, in spite of his efforts to win over the fanatical Sayeds of Marawa by constant appeals to Islam. Shaiich Suleiman Bukheit of the Aboos tribe, who came into prominence during the negotiations for the release of the Jacob Mission, died on 7th October and has been succeeded by his nephew, Salim Bukheit.

Captain fazluddin writes that the Idrisi had a serious reverse at Jebel Saafan, which he has evacuated* The Idrisi had also to retire from a position in Jebel Heimah to ^ukel*Jumaa which is the present headquarters of Sheikh Abu Hadi, the head (^uhra Sheikh* As reported in ray letter of 2nd September the news of the Idrisi’s reverse at Jebel Saafan was received here early last month, but it was denied by dyed iustafa. As the Akhwans have marched north, the Imam appears to have strengthened all his centres in the southern 'iemen and has available for service elsewhere all the forces he had collected to oppose the anticipated Akhwan attack* Captain tfazluddin says that he has heard from a reliable source that the Hashid and Bakil were reconciled to the Iraamic cause as against Ibn Baud by the Imam’s son in iiajjah offering a bull as sacrifice at the door of each of the principal Bheikhs of the Hashid and Bakil. The Sheikhs promised to fight against Ibn Baud but not against the Idrisi* iNow that the Akhwan menace has passed, at least for the present, it will be interesting to know what will be the future attitude of the Hashid and Bakil towards the Imam* heports received this week from Hpdeida disclose a situation which may possibly, in the event of an Idrisi reverse, develop into a serious menace to Hodeida.

Hassan Kanjooni # the agent of the political Oflicer, Hodeida, states that while he was detained with the 'Jacob* l is sion in dajil last winter, a telegram was received from the Imam by the ex-Vali, ahmud hadhim, at bajil, in which he was asked to do his utmost to send the mission back to liodeida and to inform the Quhra Sheikha that their request for assistance in attacking the Christians could not oe granted until the lesion was released and had reachod Hodeida safely# After that the Imam would send down his men to assist the Quhra to oueu the Christians from Hodsida* Lassan Aanjooni considers the time for the fulfilment of this promise has now arrived.

Baiyid &gt;u)dul i^Aix of the Jacob Mission fame entirely disapproves of the Commandant's methods of administration The ex-Vali, : aliniua j.adhim, has arrived at kenaklia. | The reason given for this is that he is going to open negotiations J for peace with the Idrisi.

The reason for this is stated to be that complaints hare reached the Imam of heavy taxes imposed on Sana merchants by the Idriei and of other exactions by ex-Turkish officials in5 V jy the employ of the Idriei # The imam by this action expeccs to divert the trade with his territory to the routes via Lahej and Khokha and also to hit the Idrisi hard financially. Bura is still in the hands of the idrisi, but the Imam's victories at other places seem to have made the people so nervous that the notables of the place are said to have applied to the Imam for protection and offered hostages* These notables think that Bura will eventually fall into the hands of the Imam and that unless they hasten to tender their allegiance, they will meet the same fate as the inhabitants of tia&amp;fan, which has been captured by the Imam* £abeed was 'en fete' on receiving the news of the Imam's victory in Jebel Reima* This news is said to have had a damping effect on the Idrisi partisans in Ztbeed. The Imam has cent orders to the Amil there to secure hostages from the notables of the town at the first opportunity. It war reported from I odeida that some time back the Arab ccQinunity of Hodeids headed by Tahir Rsvjab Kfiendi addressed t petition to the League of Lations through the French *inister for foreign Affairs. The petition war sent to one. • Ries, the rench Consul i t Aden for tr* ntmiieelon. The Consul, however, returned the petition saying that the firm of Me,urice flies exists in Fodeidr. only for trade purposes and that it did not wish to enter into politics. Intrigue in arawa is said to be rife, Uaiyid Ali Bari, the nephew of Saiyid Abdul iatiir, being chiefly concerned in it. The Idrisi has despatched a force of 6 lc* soldiers under Bhcikh Ibn Tewab to Karawe demanding that the inhabitants should acknowledge him as their soverei gn, Tailing wnich the,v are warned that they will be severely punished. This is a counter blast to Imamic propaganda. The news of the landing of 3 Italians at Khokh* is confirmed. It appears that they came in a dhow, landed and went,- 4 - 1 went to Sheikh Abdullah kohsin Dubola, the brother of the Sheikh of ivhokha* Thence they proceeded to Hals where they met the Imam 1 8 Amil and haring obtained his promise of safety and permis sion to trade returned to iihokha* Before leaving Khokha they bought two houses for the storage of the goods which are expected to arrive shortly* They did not bring with them any goods* (■ There is no truth in the report that Italian troops had landed at Uiokha or that they were helping the Imam against the Idrisi. The apparent object of the Italians is to open trade with Sana* Y'SuiSB (Uooer and Lower)* The Zaidis are reported to be repairing the Turkish telegraph line between Taiz and Mawia* They have already repaired the line between iiTbb and laiz• It is reported that the Imam’s Amil at Taiz summoned all the Taiz Sheikhs and asked them to supply men to replace the Zaidi soldiers there who are required in bana and also to furnish hostages as a guarantee that they will not side with the British who* the Amil said* were expected to advance. The result of this meeting is not known* simultaneously* tne imam’s Amil at j awia called a meeting of Sheikhs there :or the same purpose, but the latter are said to have refused to give hostages with the result that they have been imprisoned*. The Zaidis at Taiz and Bala are said to be aying in numbers of some unknown sickness* Travellers’ reports from the Yemen state that tnere ie a concentration of troops at uamar under bayed Abdulla who is busy enlisting more men. Their destination is not Jonown but they giTe out that one of their objectives is I.obat Bakim. A ininour is again current that the Imam is dead. A similar rumour was circulated a short time ago but turned out to be false. • A report says that Ibn El Wazir, the Imam's Amil at Taiz has been summoned to Sana by the Imam who is saiu to t&gt;e very ill, and another report says that the hee lext ti and * •Xhoy **•••••••••• - 5 and gone to Rada as he is anxious about existing conditions* AD.a i'HOiaCTQRAT : * Two Sheikhs of Upper Yafa, Sheikhs Abdurahman al Muflahi and Bubakr, nakib of ,-ausatta, despatched a messenger last week to the Officer Commanding Troops at lobat Dakiin with a letter enquiring whether it is true that our troops were mowing towards i)ala* They had heard a report to that effect and if it was true they said that they would assist us by mowing a force into Bala at the same time* A reply has been sent saying that the British troops are not adwancing at present* Reports of the expected arriwal of Imamic troops at Bala continue to be receiwed* An Amiri guest now in Aden states that these reports are false and that they are given out by the ha id is theniselwes :fc&gt;r our consumption* The Imam’s Amil at Bala is reported to hawe deputed men to assess crops in the Amiri fields for the purpose of taxation.

At Kamaran it is most desirable that the future of the Lazar ette should be decided. Orders have been issued regarding the buildings and staff of the place but a great deal remains to be done if His Majesty’s Government is to be responsible for the administration of the Island and Lazaretto. At balif it is melancholy to see the loss of valuable machinery which has taken place owing to the action of the salt laden atmosphere. There is great wealth in the salt quarries in which of course no work is now carried on.

The Sheikh has been warned that if it is proved that he received more than that sum, he will lose his herd. Captain Farluddin says that speaking about the political importance of the Akhwan movement as a whole, the Idriri re?x-rked. **1 am afraid the xkhwan movement ^ fearfully lacks that cohesion # organisation t.nd tact which alone can ensure the stability of ruch a movement It is true, Ibn baud has, of late, caused certain nomad | tribes of central Arabia to settle in villages and groups of villages and allotted to them land for culti vation, which fact has materially increased his strengt] and importance 9 but inasmuchas thty neither organize the country they t.ke, nor control it by tricing hostageil ' and other precautions, nor they administer it on proper lines, thvir movement is not likely to last long. 1 am saying this from my own 11 years of experience in deal ing with kabicIs \tiibes). iheir forces consist merely I of promiscuous jumble of aiffer^nt tribes with no cohe- g sion in them except a somewhat vrgue and fanaticra no-rank a*u fils and th«.ir aim. ar* no mor« thtJi a fcr- ciblfc imposition of th«ir strict and puritaniCcl doc- trinos in a most untaotful, unoompromisin* and rude manner without the least idea of a proper orernment or administration. Their simple ideas of unity of Cod and equality of mankind do appeal to popular ffncy, and they carry everythin* before them in a fit of fired fancy by sheer force of numbers, but their bigotry, fa naticism and narrowmindedness in treatin* thsss wh* differ from them even in such email metiers e f o in. or the chewing of tobacco, as Kafirs, leaves in the I minds of the people nothing but hatred ana repulsion I against them. Although, the people of Abba have met with merely their deserts on beinr thus treatsd by Ibn Baud's men, but in reality, the prohibition of the burial of the dead bodies of those killed in the town j j during the massacre which followed their entry into it was simply inhuman. I kn.w the fact, but have not dis cus* ed this point with the deputation, as 1 knew that according to their beliefs, they (the dead) were apos tates and the body of an apostate is not rshpeoted.' Captain Kasluddin further says that on being asked Whether he will assist Ibn Baud in his invasion of fcecca. the Idrisi replied -we are not allowed ts fight in the sacred precinots of Kaaba, nor does Ibn gaud intend to fight in I ecca. all that he -ill uo is to besiege i ecca alter taking Taif and cut/ off its communications. 1 shall avoid practical assistance as far s possible and in fact he does not stand in need | of my assistance.

T© The lion’ble Mr.ftrnest ctovell ^cott, C * * 0 * , If * t • ^ • ,YiSML'lfl There seems to be no doubt that the Idrisi has every intention of advanoing on iiabeed shortly* Sayed kustafa says that the Idrisi cannot refuse to answer the call he has received from his fellow Sunnis. Major Barrett visited Jizan on 26th August and saw Sayed Mustafa, who ave him a cordial reception. Unfortunately very heavy r^tin on the previous day # which had fl oded the country and rendered it impassable pre vented the Idrisi from returning from babiza where he had gone for the Id f stival in time to meet Major Barrett as he had intended. I iiayed Mustafa said that 3 representatives of Bin Baud were in Babiza at that time, and that he was anxious to discover their intentions before he left Asir on a visit to Kgypt as he had intended. f Bayed Mustafa expressed himself as much satisfied with Bin Baud*8 intervention in Asir affairs, but it ap ears that the Idrisi, while consulting Bayed Mustafa freely in all questions concerning relations with the Imam and leaving the execution of decisions very largely in his own hands, had Kept Central ^rabian affairs entirely in his own hands. The Bode id ah merchants have presented another | petition asking that in the event of the British withdrawal I from Hodeictah, the Turks may be allowed to return to the Yemen. Failing the Turks they desire any civilized Government preferably headed by a cadet of the Egyptian ruling house, but in no way subservient to Mgypt. They do not desire a locally elected Chief, nor do they want the Idrisi or the Imam, but in case of absolute necessity would prefer the Idrisi.The ex-V‘- li, Jahmud Kadhim is reported to have circulated news that Constantinople has been evaciated by the British and Fre ch armies. The anniversary of the Turkish Constitution was celebrated in the house of the ex-Vali , where all the Turks in ^ana having « seembled offeree prayers for the bultan and the Imam. There appears to have been some dispute between the Imam and bheikh Mikdad of Anis. The Arhab soldiers instigated by the latter tried to make a r^id on Sana but the Imam had them disarmed. A reconciliation is said to have since been effected between the Imam and the Sheikh. ABKfl PKOT22C TOBATE # Jl The Alawi Sheikh, All.Jashir, died in Lahej on the 16th July last. His son, Abdul ftabi, succeeded him. It will be reraberat that after the last 2aidi advaoce on x»ala the vlawi made his submission to the Sale is and was detained at i&gt;al&amp; for a time. Our news correspondent at Jabel Jihaf (Amiri) reports that tho Imam has ordered the withdrawal of his troops from j-&gt;ala and that the men are {gradually leaving under cover of the ni :ht, but later information goes to discredit this news. Our Yafa oorresoondent reports that a party of 2aidis, which was proceed in to Beda was opposed and in the fighting which ensued 8 haidis were killed and 15 wounded. The Jiaidis were oing to a place called Mrlajim in Heda where they had been invited by a relative of the Beda bultan, who had been coquetting with them. Yours, etc., (Si ned) T.B.bcott.«N&amp;.

Reference to prepifous correspondence i Description of Enclosure.g.?/ ’JSQ Dear ir* ^cott:- The following is a summary of the news reported since the despatch of my last letter dated 30th* July 1920* The Idrisi Commandant at Bajil, Oheiich /*ahomed Tahir i id wan, has written to the iolitical officer, hodeida, to say that he has intercepted a letter from okeiian oa&amp;r ^ Mlsjaji, a Hodeida merchant, to the address of the ex-vali, ahmood Hadhim, the purport of which, he says, is that the Turkish Government are victorious; that ustafa hemal J?aaha, President of the nationalists and enemy of the existing I wretched Turkish Government, has entered Constantinople with all his foroeeand co-operated with the ^urks there; that Anwar l&amp;sha has returned from Afghanistan with a large I quantity of gold and has sent a part of it to i ustafa hemal in order to strengthen his armies; that oolonel Jaooh has written an article in the Times praising ahnood Sadhim and the other Turks in the Yemen and giving hopes for tha fulfilment of their aapirationa. lha Xdriai Co-’aniandant saye that Kalmmaicama Jamil Bay and i.halil &gt;ay who are In Tarawa and through whom Shaikh umer Misjajl transmits his letters to Mabmood Sadhim, are engaged in 1 propaganda work, the object of which is to incite the \ irate against the British Government. This/This is a sample of the rumours that float about the Yemen. Gmer ^izjaji rendered tajor £eeic some assistance in procuring the release of the Jacob Mission but otherwise is reported as a rabid pro-iurJk and great personal friend of ahraood iadhim. He was decorated for his war services to the Turkish cause. The news of the Imam’s desire to make peace with the Idrisl is confirmed, though peace negotiations have not actually started. The imam is said to be seeking for a go-between. Captain fazluddln, la his letter dated 3rd. August 192^, states that the Idrisi has occupied nearly all the important centres in and that «^yed uotafa is at . idi recruiting soldiers for the Aabid campaign, arrangements for which are expected to be completed in about a fortnight letter of 29th. April last left Jizan about the middle of July. They are at present at Bajil awaiting the arrival of the above expeditionary force. ( worse than ever and this may have a restraining effect on his ambitions. Captain ’azluddin, however, reports that the Idrisi is verrliable to look for the intervention of Providence on his behalf and that he considers the arrival of in baud’s troops for his assistance at Tbba he has been receiving persistent reports of oppression . carried on by Bheikh Ali Cthman of Khoka tne Imata’s Amil for ok'tm, and places in the neighbourhood, who has put in custody several small chiefs including the son of the or so. The Aaranik and other sheikhs referred to in lay The Idrisi’s financial condition is, however ^ as due to the direct act of xrovidence. '• T T . and ^oweri.

Shafaie are said not to have responded to the Imiva’s call for service, fhe i of hala writes that the people are expecting the British Jovemaent to males a forward move now that the xt&amp;idis are in a fix. ABIh . Captain Pazluadin in a letter dated ird .ugust 1920 confirms the news of toe occupation of Afeha by Bin Baud. Irom the details given it appears that lifter the attach by haaao bin Aidh on the iuhail garrison reported in ay last letter the Idrisi ashed Ibn Baud for assistance and reoeived a favourable and ready response* A large force of utowuns estimated at betwe n 12 and 14 thousands* with about 1500 men from the -ahtan and the xfobia and aifeida tribes under the leadership of Mohamad ibn ad Allan!, the chief Bheikh of hah tons, im old and faithful partisan of the Idrisi, appeared on the confines of \bha on 21st July 1920 and offered the following five conditions to Hasan bln aidhi- 1. he should resign the fairate of Asir ft once* but should be allowed to remain Sheikh of his own tribe* the Beni lughaid. /2, f e aurkish2. ipie 'jhxxklah arms and ammunition Xeit in Ms trust ior tlie Idrisi should be distributed at once in the xollo an? manners- 1 rd to the Xdrigi Irfl to Xbn Baud Ird to be leant in tie fort o£ Aha, for purposes of defonce* under the supervision of t e Idrisian ii^prsasnt itive in x.-. S, He should give armed assistance against the .iharif of Mecca. 4. He should hand over to the Idrisi, at once, all the principal men of the force that attached the Idrisi force at iuhail for trial according to the dhria law* h. Ho resistance should be offered to the joint forces of Xbn Hand and Idrisi occupying Xha; the forces in question undertaking not to molest or nlunder any body. f V fhese conditions were indignantly rejected by Hasan ibn idh, and Ms cousin Hoh-umaad ibn ibdui’ ~mhm ^n ciicie out with £000 men of the Beni uughaid and Beni Malik and 4 guns to give battle to the invaders, fh© latter who, it Is believed, were at first anxious to nep-otiate further and avoid bloodshed as fur as poa ible, ithout waiting for the attack, charged killing about 800 men of Ibn lidh*s force, fhe battle lasted for £ hours. Tho remnants of Ibn kidh'g men fled in disorder. Bin Baud* s force entered the to n of Abha the same day where, it is said, they gathered a large booty. In connection with this force of Bin Baud, Captain f’asluddin has gleaned time following information:- fhe Ushwan troops numbered about 1000 horsesiien whan they started from Hejd, but the number went on increasing as they passed through the territories of the various tribes on their way to .sir, ihey are mostly camel riders or horsemen. Xhey carry very little provisions /ith them, bait depend for /themtiiea partly on the loot of the hostile tribes or the hospitality of friendly ones, throu h whoee country they pat&gt;s« fhey are paid no regular salaries, but a share in the booty they gather, the remount getting as much as the man. fheir manner of fighting is to charge in a compact body through fire or odds and engage the enemy in a hind to hand fight, fhey give no quarters while fighting, fhey refrain from the killing of women, children and old men or the destruction of crops or fruit trees, fhey faithfully observe their words, treaties or gov Hants, fhey observe their religious practices most assiduously on the field of battle or while encamped. fhe Commander of the Uchwan troops is Abdul aiz, a cousin of Bin Saud, He holds oommand jointly with Q&amp;sl Abdullah Haahid. fhey are still at Hahn but it appears that two representatives of theirs with two others from the Habia and Hafei&amp;a and two from the Hahtan Chief visited the Idrisi at Jisan on the Ebth July. Captain i?azludiin says that the Humane was uncompro mising enemies of the xlng of the Hadjas and they do not make a secret of their ohief aim whiah is to wtuet the holy haaba from the hands of a person whom they describe as a monster of Iniquity and on infidel. It is surmised by Captain i'aaludain that the object of ibn Baud in occupying Bejran and a part of Asir io to throw an effective barrier between the i-ing of the juedjaz and the Imam, who, he thinks, are in alliance. Moreover by occupying the territories of the Beni 3hihr and Pharan, the two moat powerful tribes of isir (after the hahtans) who are believed to be artisans ox xlng Hussein, he desires to deprive the -uing altogether of any assistance from sir. naif In my letter of 16th July last (page E) I referred to the fighting between the fafais and the i?adli. I have now received an micorifiaiaed report that the fafais have approached /thethe Imaa’a Gommander at i)ala for aasistance to drive the tw ^ iPadlia out of juarn hilma. fixe Imam told us in February last that he will not coja J e down below Dala. It remains to be seen whether he wil^ abide by his word. I hear that oultan Saleh bin Oxaer of Uoper Yafa wham we have recently acknowledged in the place of Qmer bin £ahten, h xs been intriguing with the Imam. Before the war he was not'ed for his Puxco-Iinaniic proclivities. During the war, however, he behavad better and became friendly with this Residency. His policy now is probably to get as much as possible from us and j.ro:n the Imam and give as little as possible in return to either.

Shaikh Munassar, chief of the Zaraniqs, w &gt;s also approached with a view to hringing his tribe under-- the domination of the Imam. He pointed out in reol&gt; that as the Zaraniq confederation comprised of a considerable number of clans, chronic strife was inevitable in their country and that only a well equipped military force could cope with the situation. He suggested the appointment of a Qaimmakam m his district and the raising of 200 militia to be equipped and maintained by the Imam. He also expressed willingness to organise the force and asked for the necessary number of rifles, ammunition for 200 men, 2 guns with gunners and a certain number of Turkish officers to command the Militia, and guaranteed and order in the country if his proposals were agreed In a subsequent communication to I'ahmud Nedim, Sheikh Munassar informed him that all sections of the , , t +h P tomb of a saint (Ahmad Moosa :r:r^ih)had swo™ ,0 cooperate another and to support the Ottoman Gov^ oi him (Munassar) Qaimmakam o r ' ec^ diculc. «« foreign nggreo- + no thprein.

He was informed that :he British Government had no intention of extending its Limits but it was impossible to say as yet what the future policy would be. Sheikh Abdul Haq said that Abdul Wahab would throw in his lot with the Imam, Muhammad Nasir Muqbil or even the Sultan of Lahej which ever of the three was recognised as the Chief in the Lower Yemen. Submission to the Imam, however, he stated would be made with reluctance as the Shafais of Lower Yemen would prefer to manage their own affairs with help and advice of the British Government. 8.

Another rival claimant to the Imamate of Yemen has sprung up in Muhammad Mohsin ihn el Kutavvakkil whose claim has teen submitted here by tne Kibsi, vide paragraph 14 of the last news report. The Ahl Hubalsh and most of the Lower Yemenites support his claim, and it is stated that he is being supported by the Idrisi who has written letters to him and by the Hashid and Bekil. Ibn el Mutawakkil is reported to have occupied Hajja and Sada while RUBEITEN was entered by a force under Saiyed el Muta' and Saleh bin Saleh Ali Tairi. The Arhab clan have taken sides with the Imam. This news requires corf irmation, however. With regard to the claims of the ibn el Mutawakkil the Kibsi Sayyed brought a number of recommendatory letters from both Zeidi and Shafai chiefs. In his verbal explanation, however, the Sayyed stated that it was not intended that the Ibn el Mutawakkil should actually become Imam but merely that he should be placed in authority pending the election of a new Imam. Ibn el Mutawakkil does not fulfil all the conditions essential in an Imam as he is not sufficiently learred, though he is sufficiently suited in all other respects. The two best people for the actual Imamate accordirg to El Kibsi are Sharif Muhammad bin Abdullah el Dhayyani and Saiyed Muhanmad bin el Hadi Sharafuddin alias Abu Neb, El Kibsi denied that the movement was initiated by the Idrisi. The scheme, he said, originated amongst the Zeidis who were discontented with'Imam Yahya and the Idrisi was subsequently approached on account of his friendship and influence with the British Government wnich it was nopea would assist in promoting the scheme. Under an arrangement with Ibn El Mutawakkil the Idrisi is to extend his controlcontrol over Lower Yemen. El Kibsi said Ye recognised the disadvantage 'which such a position waild entail to the Zeidis. El Kihsi was told that it was the desire of the British Govenirnent to he on friendly terms with tne Zeidi ruler hut that it did not wish to interfere amongst rival claimants of the Imamate, A messenger of Sheikh Jab ran el Gashn one of the Kashid chiefs brought from him a letter in support of El Kibsi’s mission but the messenger in an interview stated that the Hashid and Bakil could advance against the imam only if supported, otherwise they would settle with him. On enquiry as to the method of settlement, the messenger stated that the Imam had already offered to sacrifice 25 bullocks and to depute Hashid and Bakil soldiers to collect revenue on his behalf, the soldiers getting 5 dollars per month and the Shaikhs larger sums. All the Hashid and Bakil would corr* into this arrangement. According to the messenger tnose with tne Idrisi say that they can get no more out of n and so will return to the Imam. A definite reply Has now been made to taihartmad el Mutawakkil as well as this messenger that V* British Goverrment is not prepared to interfere internal Zeidi affairs and therefore cat, give mm nnd , r , nasMd and Bakil no assists a^inst Imam anya ’ „ tn the Hashid ant Bakil our • With reference to uiie * Unapida reports that his agent who Political Officer at Hodeiaa tepor , o+v, saw 100 to 150 Hasnid . ms in Sanaa on April 8th, saw i ■rrivire in Sanaa daily for .nliafent In U* tribesmen arriving ^ M .a aw.

Very recently he announced the Turkish reoccupation of Baghdad and Palestine. The latest reports say that there are about 39 Turkish MILITARY and MEDICAL officers and 25 civilians, aad also 250 regular soldiers still in Sanaa and in tne eiflploy cf the Imam. IT - - THE IDRISX . 15, The Idrisi is very anxious to extend his influe me all over Hie Tehama and reports of deputations and letters being despatched to him by the tribes south of HOdeida have been received from different sources. He was addressed on the subject and warned not to extern his activities south of Zeidiych. His reply is onto whole satisfactory although he argues that it is tne people of the country who desire to come under his rule. He as usual displays great jealousy of the Imamic propaganda. The larlsi also receives a deputation from tne aortt which Drought him letters to show that the people were anxious to have Sharia Law. It was considered advisable not to give the Idrisi a W endowment m the ratter of meddling with the affairs of territory lvl „ at such a 10* distance from Ms own as Shahren and Basha ani discussion on the subject was therefore ref used. Captain Faxl-ud-din reports the arrival in Jlsan of another deputation of B.Shahran. .no stated thatthat Yhu Saood had sent a force of 2500 men to attack Baish in King Hussein’s territory. The IdrisL appeared very suspicious of the movements of King Hussein towards Runfida and Asir. The submission of Hassan Ali Pin Aiz of Ebha appears to he altogether sincere and he has again renewed his oath of fealty to the Idrisi with all the show of respectful submission. Sharif Hamood the Idrician representative at Ebha is still there. 16. Sayed Mustapha el Idrisi and Captain Mahamed Fazl-ud-din, I.li.Si returned to Jizan on the 27th April 1919. The Idrisi according to Captain Fazl- ud-din was very grateful to the British Government for their having sent him back. 17. Captain Mahomed Fazl-ud-din reports that the Idrisi arid Sayed Mustapha both seem to think that in the matter of trade the Government at Aden are treating them unduly harshly. He was shown manifests to show that tnree dhows had arrived in Jizan from Djibouti and Massowa respectively in three days, and drought 1000 cases kerosine oil, 200 bundles of dates, 100 hales piece-goods, and 170 hales of condiments etc. The Idrisi stated that Massowa and Djibouti had both been allowed 15 dhows each per monoh for trade with Jizan but that his own dhows were refused this concession. The allowance fcr Djibouti is actually five dhows. 18 The Idrisi representative at Zeldlyeh set a part, of men to occupy Salif Out on a representation tei* aidreseed to tne Idrisi, Oe agreed to eithdra. from tne place *icn hae no. teen occupied oy a part. l Iof our own troops from Kainaran. 52 of tne Idrisi/s men are, however, reported to he encamped at Salif still, and I am writing to him again on the subject* 19. The Idrisi has been informed that Goverment have sanctioned the payment of £ 7000/- per Mensem to him for the months of April, May and June 1919. / 20. This Sheikh is reported to have occupied Mokha and he is trying hard to get possession of the Turkish guns, arras aid ammunition now in the possession of All Othman Qalmmakam of Mokha. The latter has established himself in a house on a hill near Moza village and has up to now defied the Sheikh's attempts. The Sheikh is said to have attacked Moza with about 3000 men, of whom 600 were armed with rifles and the rest with clubsand sticks only, ne has made repeated requests to this Residency for assistance, which have been refused. TV - •.'|O^A?,TvTTi:D NA3IR IfJKB.IL.t_ 21. Muhammad Nasir Mukbil is reported to have occupied Taiz at the invitation of the inhabitants. The Imam again invited him to Sanaa but he excused himself on the score of infirmity, old age arid ill health. The tribes roundabout Taiz have been plundering caravans and otherwise harassing the travellers. One agent goes so far as to report that all the gardens round the town have been laid waste by these robbers and the summer houses in them demolished. Sayyed Yenya el i-Uali al Mahi, who has recently returned to Aden from a visit to Mares and otner districts, says that an alliance hashas teen made between Mohamed Nasir Mukbil Ahmed Pasha of Taiz, the sons of Ali Abdulla of Udeln the family of Abu Has of Di Sifal and Abdul Wahab Nornan of Hujariya by which they have all placed themselves under the leadership of Mohamed Nasir Mukbil with the object of resisting the Zeidis, 22. Reports- frcm Jebel Jihaf state that Muhammad Nasir and his nephew have sent tnreatenir^; letters to the Sayyed of Jebel Jihaf and otners urging them to # submit to bis authority but that the Amir of Dala and others have decided to fight him in case Muhammad Nasir actually launches an attack on that territory. Sayyed Mohammed Taha of Jebel Jihaf has been to Aden and produced one of these letters. He nas oeen told that Government would not countenance any invasion of protected districts by Muhamaed Nasir Mukbil. The reports of Muharanad Nasir's attenpts to establish himself on our side of the border are probably largely false. I am taking steps to get further and more authentic information about this. v , . ATffiN PBOTECTQ HAIE- (A) AMIHI AFFAIRS 23. The Qazi of Dala has written and requested a reconsideration of the Government decision about Amir Nasr. Sayyed Yehia el Filali says that tne Amins want no one but Amir Nasr, but that if Government absolutely insists on his deposition, they will put up or* of his brothers. But he says the tribesmen are afraid that if Amir Nasr is deposed by his tribesmen, it willwill Toe a precedent tor the deposition of other minor Sheikhs such as themselves. Amir Nasr has himself written to me asking for pardon and others have written interceding for him. .( b ). „ FjmLLAiLQim x m i 24. The son of the Lower Yafai Sultan arrived in Aden in connection with the settlement of the dispute over the Nazia’ irrigation in Ahyan. He could not he interviewed for some time owing to his having oeen taken ill suddenly on arrival, hut when interviewed it was found that he had not the authority to treat in the matter. He, however, promised to obtain it. In th^ meanwhile the Fadthlis took the law into their own hands, attacked the Lower Yafais and occupied Husn Helema and El-Husn. Sultan Abdul Qadir announced his victory in a letter to this 1 Residency to which a reply was sent reprimanding him for taking the offensive at a tine when he knew that efforts were being made by me to reconcile the differences. Prior to the receipt of this letter the Fadtnlis appear to have still further advanced and taken Uhar Jama and removed all the standing crop s. (C) ABOALl . 25.
