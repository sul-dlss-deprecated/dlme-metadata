TIEARN, CLEVELAND, AND LEE-WARNER, Solicitors to the Government of India in the matter of the Enquiry under Commulion at Baroda.APPENDIX A. November Oth, 1874. Statement by C olonel P hayije , Eesident. On Monday, November 9th, 1874, I went out for my morning exercise, as usual, at a little before 6 a.m . and returned at 5 minutes to 7, as shown by the clock above my table. I went to the washhand-stand table, on which a glass of pummelo sherbet is usually placed ; and, after taking two or three sips of it, I sat down at my writing-table and commenced writing. In about twentv minutes or half an hour, I felt sick at the stomach and at once attributed it to ilic sherbet, vhich I then thought must have been made with a bad pummelo. T then got up and took the tumbler of sherbet in my hand and threw nearly all its contents through the window. Whilst putting down the tumbler, however, upon the table, and feeling at the same time my head rather confused and dizzy,' I observed some dark sediment at the bottom of the tumbler. This struck me as very extraordinary, and for the first time the idea occurred to me that the sherbet in question had been poisoned. I at once wrote a note to the Eesi- dency Surgeon, Dr. Seward, and asked him to come over to me. He arrived in about half an hour, when I showed him the tumbler and its contents, and described the sensation which I was at that moment undergoing. He sujested that I should take an emetic, but I replied that 1 had' not taken sufficient to seriously injure me, and that I did not wish to upset myself for the whole day, as I had plenty of work to do. I at the same time mentioned to hiir that I had for some days previously had doubts about the good quality of the pummelos used for making the sherbet, as I had on some days thrown it all away, and on others, after drinking a little, had experienced much the same sensations as I was then suffering from. Dr. Seward took the tumbler away with him and said that he would analyse the contents. Dr. Seward returned about noon, saving that he had analysed the contents, and from the clearness of the indications had no doubt whatever of the presence of arsenic. 1 had in the interim written to him, asking him to give me his professional opinion in writing regarding the nature of the contents of the tumbler. My note to Dr. Seward had not reached him at this time, but a few minutes afterwards it arrived, and having read it he wrote the professional opinion asked for. Under these circumstances I at once commenced a strict enquiry, and the first point to which 1 directed att ntion was to procure a list of those persons who had had access to my private office room be tween about 6 a.m . and 5 minutes to 7 a.m . this morning. The results of this en quiry are annexed. (Sd.) R P hayre , Col. November Oth, 1874.2 Statement by A. C B oevet , Esquire, Assistant Resident.

Q—Did you return after you once left the sahib's room ? A—No. . Q—When you went to the peons' sitting place, did you see Faizoo i 3 A—Yes; he was then in the dispense-khana. Q^—When did you first see the Arab Sowar Salam tnat morning ? A—I saw him about 7 o'clock aiter the sahib's return. He then came on the Devdee from the direction of the servants' houses. Q—What did you say to him ? —7 asked him why he had come soearly on this particular morning and he said I have come because I have brought the Dewalee fruit. Q - Did the Dewalee fruit come with him ? A—No, it came a long time afterwards, about 8-30 a.m. q When you were in the Devdee when the Assistant Resident returned from shooting, was Salam there ? A —Salam was there, and Jaizoo wasalso present. Q—Where did Faizoo go from there ? A I saw him go in the direction of the servants houses. Q—Does Chimma Wagh live with you ? A—Yes. Q—What do you know about Faizoo ? A I have reported to the Resident some time ago that Faizoo was not a good character and was suspected of going to visit Nanajee Eshwunt and Nana Sahib at night. He also has been in the habit of going to the Kazee in the city and the Kazee to visit him here. I should have mentioned this ; but he used to come to visit the Padree sahib, so I said nothing. Q_Who do you suspect of having attempted to administer poison to the sahib ? , . v j • n A—I suspect Faizoo, because he has for a long time past been engaged m all kinds of intrigues, both in the time of Colonel Barr and Colonel Shortt. In Colo nel Shortt's time he used to go with Colonel Shortt's butler to the house of Rahoorkur, Nana Sahib, and others for the purpose of giving them information. I have myself seen Faizoo go with Colonel Shortt's butler and others to the city for this purpose. Before me this 11th day of November 1874. (Sd.) R. Phayee , Col, Reaident. Novembeb 11th, 1874. Faizoo Humzain , Mussulman, aged about 45, Chobdar and table servant, Residency establishment, Baroda :— I was first employed at Baroda by Major Malcolm, Resident, as second ser vant, and was made Chobdar by Colonel Davidson, Resident, about twenty years ago, and I have acted as table servant as well from that time to the present. When Colonel Wallace left, I obtained a place in the Khas Paga on Rs. 10 per mensem, continuing, however, to act as Chobdar and table servant at tro Residency. The Durbar service was in the name of my son, who is now fourteen years old. I have received that amount up to the present time. I live in the7 city and come every day for duty. I have a room in the Residency compound: my family lives in the city. Q—Where are you in the habit of sleeping ? A—I usually sleep in the Residency, but I go home to sleep every third or fourth day. Q—What is the name of the Mussulman who has been in the habit of visit ing you at the Kesidency lately ? A—He is called Kazee Dada Meeya ; I do not know his father's name. Kazee Dada Meeya lives in the city near the lines of one of the regiments. He only used to visit me when the Kevd. Mr. Taylor came to the Residency, whom he used to visit. I do not know whether he is in the Maharajah's service or not. I did not know him before he used to come here to visit Mr. Taylor. I do not not know why he first came to me instead of going to the Padree Sahib direct. I know nothing about him except in connection with his visits to the Padree. I am acquainted with Salam, an Arab sowar, a private servant of the Maha raja. I have known him since the present Maharaja's time. Salam has never come to mv room in the Residency to sit, nor has he ever smoked with me. He did not come to my room on Monday last the 9th about 9 a.m . ] saw him in the adjoining room to mine on Monday last at about 9-30 a. m . He called out to me and 1 said that it was near breakfast time and that I was changing my clothes. Salam then left. No further conversation passed between us on the morning in question. Q—Do you remember seeing the Assistant Resident return from shooting at about &amp;-30 a.m . on the morning of Monday the 9th instant in question, and were you not at that time sitting on the bench and talking to the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam ? A—I did not see the Assistant Resident, and I was not talking to Salam. Salam has never come to my house in the city. 1 have never seen Salam talking with the old man Govind Baloo, who cleans out the Resident's private office. When my boxes were searched on Monday the 9th instant, Govern ment Rs. 100 were found in one of them. I usually keep my money in the city, where my family is. Q—Do any other persons from the city, except the Kazee above referred to, and Salam, ever come to your quarters at the Residency ? A—No one has ever come from the city to visit me. Q—If, as you say, the Arab Sowar Salam has never been in the habit of visit ing your quarters at the Residency, how came he to come to your quarters and call out to you on Monday the 9th instant ? A— I cannot say why ho came. Q—Do you ever go to the quarters of the old Hamal, Govind ? A—I never go, and 1 have never sat smoking outside with him : in passing I have enquired about his wife. Q—Do you know how Govind Baloo came to put poison in my sherbert on the morning ot Monday, the 9th ? A—I did not see him d it—how can I tell ? I slept a&amp; the city on Sunday night, and returned to duty about 7 a.m . on Monday, the 9th. I slept on Fri day night, the 6th instant, in the city (witness corrects himself and states that Friday night he slept in the Residency). I also slept at the Residency on Thursday and Saturday nights last. Q—Have you ever made pummelo sherbet for the Resident ? A—Yes, I have when Abdoola has not made it I may have made it within the last week or ten days. I have never brought it to the Resident's room myself. There was no special reason for my not bringing it. 1 may have made the sherbet last Friday. I never put sugar into the sherbet. The above examination has been read over to the witness in Hindoostani—a language which be understands—and has been acknowledged to be correct. November llth, 1874. Signature of witness Faizoo, (Sd.) Before me. (Sd.) R. P hayre , Col., Resident.8 The examination of Faizoo Rumzain having been recorded, he is ordered to be placed in confinement, pending further enquiry. (Sd.) R. P hatri, Col., Resident. November 11th, 1874. November 11th, 1874. Pedeo de Souza , Portuguese, age about 37 years, butler in the service of Colonel R. Phayre, C. B.. Resident ;— I have been in the service of Colonel Phayre about 25 years, and I accompanied him to Baroda. I went on leave to G-oa on the 3rd October last, and returned again on Novem ber 3rd. Salam Arab Sowar of the Maharaja, has been in the habit of going to the 8ervant3 , quarters. When he comes he usually goes to Faizoo's room, and sits outside on the veran dah. Next to Faizoo^s room is the Ayah's room, and a dwarf wall divides those two rooms from mine, I have never seen him sit anywhere else. Since I came from leave on the 3rd instant, I have seen Salam twice. On Monday last, the 9th instant, I saw him sitting, as usual, outside Faizoo's room, in the verandah. I did not see whether Faizoo was there or not. At that time the Maharaja had not arrived. It was about 9 o'clock. I was then employed in plucking some quail that had just been brought in. I have also seen a man whom they call the Kazee go to Faizoo^s room. I do not know who the Kazee is, but he used also to come to see the Rev. Mr. Taylor. He used, also, to come at other times. He has been in the habit of coming to Faizoo's room, and sitting there for long periods together, lie usually comes on horseback, and wears a white turban tightly bound. No other jassoods or personal servants of the Maharaja ever go to the servants' quarters. I have not seen any other people from the city go to Faizoo's quarters. I have been solicited by Nur Ollah, former Chobdar, to go down to the city to the Maharaja's Palace. I told my master of it at the time, and Nur Ollah was discharged. Since that I have not been solicited by any one. Faizoo sleeps as often in the city as he does here. I suspected Faizoo of being concerned in the matter of administering poison to the Resident, because of his connection with the city, his intimacv with Salam and others who live in the city. He also sometimes makes the sherbet and has access at all times to the Resident's private office room. He is also in the pay of the Durbar. Govind Baloo, the old Hamal, who looks after the Resident's private office, dressingt-able, bathing water, &amp;c., always shuts up the Resident's room the last thing at night, and goes off to his room to sleep. Faizoo or Abdoolla, whoever may be on duty, leaves the bungalow about the same time. Throughout the whole day also, except during meal time, iaizoo and Govind are always present on duty in the Residency. This examination, having been read over to the witness in Hindoostanee— a language which he understands—is acknowledged by him to be correct. Mark t of Pedro DeSouza. Before me this 11th day of November 1874. (Sd.) R. Phayrk , Col., Resident. Novembee 11th, 1874. Antone John de Souza , Portuguese, aged about 24 years, cook to Colonel R. Phayre&gt; C.B., Resident:— I have been empoyed in 0 jlonel Phayre's service as cook for the last seven or eight years, and I accompanied him to Baroda. The Maharaja's Arab Sowar, Salam, is in the habit of com ing to Faizoo's quarters twice in the week when the Maharaja visits the Resident. I know this because the cook-room is opposite those quarters, and I can see what goes on. I have also seen him come at other times on special occasions, and he then always goes to Faizoo s room. I have also seen a person called Kazee, who always goes to Faizoo, and who visits the Reverend Mr. Taylor when he comes to Baroda. I have also seen the Kazee referred to a great many times when Mr. Taylor was not at Baroda. I have once enquired of l aizoo why this Kazee always came. Faizoo replied that he came to get news of Mr. Taylor. The Kazee, however, stayed a long time at each visit, much longer than was necessary to make such enquiries. I cannot say positively whether the Kazee came last week or not when Mr. Taylor was here. ... , t j xi Other persons also have come from the city to visit Faizoo, but I do not know tbem. On Monday, the 9th instant, I saw Salam, as usual, outside Faizoo's quarters. No one ever comes into the cook-room. No one has ever made any overtures to me about going to the city, or anything else. Faizoo usually sleeps in the city, but sometimes sleeps here. On one occasion Pedro asked him why he went to the city bo often, and Faizoo got angry and said that he never left without telling Abdoola.I P Jfpectcd Fakoo's coTiiplicjly in the crime of administering poison, becanse he receives pay from tho Darbar, and has bf:ea mixed up in Baroda intrigues for a long time past and is alvrays enquiring about the Sahib to give information in the city. Abdoola and I had Jatcly an ultereation with him about this, and another reason is the visits that are constantly paid to him by the Arab Sowar Salam, the Kazee, and others from the city who have no business there at all. [Sd.J An tone Jooao de Soma, The above examination, having been read over to the witness in Hindoostanee. a lanenape which he uuderstands, is acknowledged by him to be correct. Before me this 11th day of November, 1874. [Sd.] R. P hayee , Col., Resident. November 11th, 1874. A bdoola. M ahomep , Mussulman, age about 35, Chobdar and table servant. I have been ofl and on m Colonel Phayre's service for eighteen years. I came to Baroda with Colonel I nayre, and was made Chobdar in the place of Nur Ollah who was discharged. I lave t.ie highest certificate of character frum my master and others whom I have served for the above period. U '! av ® y ou ever had anything to complain of since you have been in my service ? A—J ar irom it. I have been treated as a ehild of the family both by my master and mis tress. J am in the habit of making pummelo sherbet for the eahib, and I made it on the morning ot Monday, November 9th. Faizoo Chobdar has occasionally made it, and he made it 1 believe, on Friday last. Faizoo has on more than one occasion brought the sherbet himself and putit on the sahio s table; but 1 put it there on the morning of Mondav, the 9th. When my child died, I aizoo prepared the sherbet for about twelve days runnine:' This was about three months ago. » I have known the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam since I came to Baroda, when the Maha raja comes to visit at the Residency twice a week. Salam generally goes to Faizoo'e room sometimes he goes inside and sometimes he sits outside in the veranda. My room is about twenty to twenty-five paces beyond Faizoo's, and I can see any one who comes if I am in mv room. Last Monday, the 9th instant, 1 did not see Salam at Faizoo's room, because I was at work in t.ie bungalow. 1 saw the Assistant Resident return from shooting about 8-30 on that morning, and then Salam and two other Mahratta jasoodsof the Maharaja were talking to gether with Jaizoe in the Residency back verandah. When the Madam Sahib was leaving for England she gave me and Pedro strict orders that no one but ourselves were to prepare the tea, coffee, &amp;c., for the Sahib. Faizoo, however on several occasions has endeavoured, in a marked manner, to forestall us in this respect! both i and J cdro in consequenee of our orders, have frequently remonstrated with Faizoo about this, but he has always put us off, and has not attended. I have never suspected that there was any special motive on Faizoo's part for doing this. i always used the best pummelo for extracting the juice, and on one or two occa- sious, about a month or two ago, 1 have brought bad pummelos to show. The pummelo that I used on the morning of the 9th was perfectly fresh and in good condition. I showed it to r. beward 1 could not understand why the Sahib complained two or three mornings pre- iou,s y t lat fhe juice was bad. No suspicion crossed my mind that any one had drugged it. t was my custom to place it on the washhand-stand table about half-past 6, when I v en o nu regular work. At that time the old Hamal, Govind, and another used to be in the room, and the peons, as usual, were arranging the papers, pens, ink, &amp;c. It was therefore per fectly possible for any one to have put something into the sherbet after my depart ure, and before the Sahib's arrival. Faizoo's business is to clean the silver, cii j 'r^akfast table. The breakfast room is only about fifteen paces from the a n s private office in line with it, and had Faizoo come in from the breakfast-room into ic pnva e omce by the back entrance, no one could have seen him unless they had been engaged m the room at the time. On Monday morning, the 9th instant, Faizoo returned ll 01 % i 1C , out 6-30 before the Sahib had returned from his walk. I know this because t ic katnba horse always passes the dispense-khana, where I am at work. I therefore know exactly Ine time when he comes. When I had placed the juice on the Sahib's table, as usual, 1 went to the dispense-khana to prepare the butter, and then I saw Faizoo on his way to the dispense-khana. i aizoo then went into the dining-room.

Nursoo Rajanow , Jemedar of Peons, Residency establishment, Kamatee, age about 50, Baroda, states :— I have served in the Residency about 31 years. I was made jemedar after Major Malcolm's death by Captain Barton about sixteen years ago. I am acquainted with the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam. When the ex-llanee, Jumna Baie, was re siding at the Residency for her confinement, Salam was employed by the Maharaja to keep watch over the Residency and to give him information of everything that went on. At that time Faizoo was on very intimate terms with Salam, and has continued so up to the present time. In the time of Colonel Shortt Paizoo was on very intimate terras with Col. Shortt's butler and they used to visit the city and go to Nana Saheb Dewan, Bulwantrao Eshwant, and also to Rahoorkur. They were also accompanied by Doolub, Naik of Peons in the Residency establishment, and by his two brothers Maunsing and Premsing, all of whom were last year expelled from the cantonment, but now reside in the city. Faizoo was on very intimate terms with all of these persons, and used to accompany them to the city. Faizoo was engaged in all sorts of intrigues during the whole time that Col. Shortt was here. I am acquainted with a Mussulman Kazee who was on very intimate terms with Faizoo and who used to come to Mr. Taylor, lie often came to Faizoo's quarters when Mr. Taylor was not in Baroda. When the Resident was at Nowsaree, in March last, with the Maharaja, Salara did not live with the Maharaja in the town of Nowsaree, but he lived in the com pound of the bungalow occupied by the Resident. I know that Salam is a dangerous man, because in Col. Shortt's time he was employed with Faizoo to seize the Kar- koons of Rahoorkur, who were in Col. Shortt's butler's room at the Residency. The facts of the case were verv notorious and made much sensation at the time. When this occurred Salam was, as now, the confidential servant of the Maharaja. Since Col. Phayre became Resident, I do not know whether Faizoo has been engaged in any intrigue like that above described, but I do know that he continues to bo on very intimate terms with Saiam, and that he is always enquiring what goes on, and resides chiefly in the city. I reside in the city, and I come on duty every day between 7-30 and 8 o'clock. In the time of the Ranee Jumna Baee's residence at the Residency I incurred the Maharaja's displeasure, because 1 refused to allow access to his men as he wished. That displeasure has never been removed. Two of my brothers were turned out of the service ; one was subedar-major of the Irregu ar Cavalry, and the other was a havildar. Pensions, however, were granted subsequently, at the Resident's intercession. I am considered by the Maharaja as an enemy, and no overtures of any kind have been made to me. In connection with the attempt to poison the Resident, my suspicion falls on Faizoo for the reasons already disclosed. Ihe old Harml, Govind, I believe to be incapable of such a crime. I have never heard of Govind going about any where or of his beinor en^acred in any intrigue. Faizoo knows Govind well, and has plenty of opportunities of talking to him. Signed (native character.)

The witness shows a marked disinclination to say anything whatever about Faizoo.) Q—How many years have you been employed at the Residency ? A—About six or seven years. Q—Do you know the Maharaja's Arab Sowar Salam ? ^ ^ know him by sight, but I have never had anything to say to him. He usually comes with the Maharaja. Q—Have you ever seen Salam at Faizoo's quarters ? A—Yes, I have. Q—Has the Resident ever injured or offended you in any way ? A—No, not in the least. Before me this 12th day of November 1874. (Sd.)

He usually goes to Faizoo's room, and there sits and talks with him. I only remember seeing Salam when the Maharaja's Sowaree comes. Salam alone of the Maharaja's private attendants has been in the habit of going to the servants' quarters. I have seen Faizoo sometimes preparing sherbet for the Resident. I remember that he prepared it one day lately, but 1 am not quite sure as to the exact day. I have seen a Mussulman, who is called ' the Kazce,' come to Faizoo's quarters on several occasions, and have seen him sit and talk with him.

He comes with the Maharaja ; s Sowaree and usually goes to Faizoo's room, and sits and talks with him. 1 also have seen a Mussulman called ' the Kazee,' who goes to visit Faizoo. I do not know who he is, or what he comes for, but I have heard that he came to visit the Rev. Mr. Taylor. I have often seen him when Mr. Taylor has not been here. I am not on good terms with the Maharaja's Arab S^war, Salam. One time when the Commission was sitting, he asked me to give him information about Bhow Pooneker, and pro mised me to get some favour fiom the Maharaja. I said that 1 would tell my master if ho made any overtures to me of that kind. Since then he has shown enmity towards me, and when the Resident went to Mukhurpoora, would not allow mo to sit in the bullock cart pro vided for the servants. I had a quarrel with him about this. I did not tell Pooneker what Salam had said to me, as no fresh overtures were made to me. I know the old Hamal, Govind Baloo ; he lives near my room only two doors off.

Before me this Mth day of November 1874. (Sd.) R. P hayre , Col., Resident. Statement by the Rev. J. Taylor , A.M., Missionary, Borsud, Kaira District, age 55. Since the middle of 1873 I have been in the habit of visiting Baroda as a missionary and visiting families in the camp, the railway and the city. On these occasions I have stayed at the Residency, where natives have been in the habit of visiting me in my private room. I know a Mussulman who represented himself to me as'' a Deccan Kazee.' He mentioned his name, which I do not remember, but he said he was best known by the above name. Almost every time that I have visited Baroda he has called upon me at the Residency ; he represented himself as having once been in the favour of the pre sent Gaekwar during his imprisonment at Padra, that the present Claekwar was under great obligations to him, but that owing to the fact of his being a Mussul man, he was disliked by the Brahmin courtiers, who poisoned the minds of the Gaekwar against him by saying that he had called him a kaiir and had spoken disrespectfully of the Hindu religion, that for a long time he had never been in vited to the Durbar, was under a cloud, would leave Baroda at once, but having got pecuniarily involved, on account of the expenses which he had incurred on the Graekwar's behalf when he was in prison, he wished to be reinstated into favour, and thus reinburse himself. He hoped that by my personal influence either with the Resident or His Highness, I might be the means of enabling him to secure his object. • He never was present at any of my religious services with the natives and always avoided religious conversation. So importunate was he in his desire that 1 should introduce him him to the Resident, with a view, as he said, to his restoration to favor with the Gaekwar, that he has even come to me at Borsud, and when 1 was at Bombay last year was particularly importunate. I always told him that if he had any special grievance and would draw up a petition he might either present it directly to the Resident, who was always open to receive petitions, or that I might venture to present it myself. He declined to write a petition, and I always16 declined to interfere in a general question like that raised witliout any specific object. 1 have asked liim why he did not go himself direct; and he replied that it was best to use some person to introduce him. rius went on for about fifteen months ; the same story being always told and the same answer being always given. I had no reason to suspect the man. I therefore made no objection to his coming. About the end of August, on arrival at the Residency on a Thursday morning, the Maharaja who was sitting in the drawing-room with the Resident, expressed a wish to speak to me. The Resident called me, and I sat down and began to converse with His Highness. The Resident and one of the Durbar were present at the time. Next day the Resident informed me that H. H. the Gaekwar wished to shew me his new Palace, and asked me to go accordingly on Saturday morning early. I did so. I ought here to mention, however, that on the previous day (Friday) the Kaze3 above referred to called upon me, asked me if 1 should like to have an interview with the Gaekwar, to my surprise alluded to the conversation I had had the previous day with His Highness, said that he had an injluential friend in the Durhar who gave him infortnation, and could arrange any interview with the Gaekwar that ^ ould be agreeable, ^nd asked in a casual way apparently what nuzzerana I would take. I replied at once that all 1 desired was to see the Gaekwar take good advice, and reform the ad ministration of his State. The Kazee made no further remark on the subject. It was after this interview that the Resident spoke to me saying that the Maharajah wished to see me, and advised me to go. I went to the Palace and was ushered into a room where His Highness soon appeared. Rao Saheb Bapubhai and Govind Rao Mama, of the Durbar, conducted me there. His Highness opened the conversation, which at once took a political turn, and from what they said 1 came to the conclusion that they were very much concerned about the recent letter which the Gaekwar had received from Govern ment. The conversation afterwards took a religious turn, and the interview closed with His Highness shewing me over the new Palace. He expressed himself as much pleased at my visit, and in an hour or two I left for Borsud. On my next visit to Baroda the Kazee called upon me again, spoke of my visit to the Gaekwar, said that it had been of great use to him, that he had seen the Gaekwar, who spoke in very laudatory terms of me, yet that all he desired had not been accomplished, as the Gaekwar had not invited him so freely to the Durbar as he desired. On Thursday the 5th November, when I came home from the city in the evening, Faizoo was standing by my room-door, and 1 told him that as I had a bad headache not to allow any one to disturb me for an hour. He said that the Kazee was waiting for me. I said that he might come. He again said that he had had only one interview with the Gaekwar since the time I had visited His Highness. He repeated what he had several times told me before, that though the Gaekwar had given him a horse, he had never given him any money, and that I might look upon him as dirt if he had received as much as a fie from the Gaekwar, but he hoped that by my favour he would soon find him self in much better circumstances. I do not think he came the next day, Friday, 6th November, and I left for Borsud on the 7th. (Sd.) J. V. S. Taylor. Before me this 14th day November 1874. (Sd.) R.

A—1 did not look at my watch before I went out that morning. The sun had not long risen, but from its height it might have risen about fifteen minutes. Q—When you first saw Faizco, how far off was he ? A—He was about 200 paces off. I am quite certain that it was Faizoo and no one else. I went across to the Post Office only, and then returned. On my return I saw him [Faizoo^ by the servants^ quarters, going to his room. I went into the cook-room and did not see him afterwards. When I returned from the Post Office I saw Salam, the Arab sowar, stand ing near the place where the peons sit. It took me about ten to fifteen minutes to go to the Post Office and back. Faizoo some times comes late and sometimes early. I have told him that if he did not come in good time I should speak about it to the Sahib. On the morning in question he came in good time.

After the sahcb had returned about 7 o'clock, Faizoo came mto the dispense- khana to clean the silver. I remember when Faizoo came into the dlspensc-kbana, because I saw the Saheb's horse pass as usual. Until Faizoo came into the dispense-khana that morning about 7 o'clock to clean the silver I did not sec him do any work at all. When Faizoo sleeps in the city he usually does not return to duty till about 7-30 or 8 a m Faizoo slept in the city, on the night of Sunday, November 8. On Monday morning, when he came from the city he came unusually early. I have never seen h.m come from the city so earlv before as he did on that morning. When Faizoo went into the dining-room oil the morning of Monday, all the doors were open. This examination, having been read over to the witness in Hindoostauee, a language which he understands, is acknowledged by him to be correct. (Sd.) Mark of Abdoola Mahomed. Before me this 23rd day of November, 1874. (Sd.) R.
