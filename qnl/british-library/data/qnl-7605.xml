Orders were issued by the Commission^ ! commence forthwith a t^.-mile scale survey, and for this purpose the trial ! :i:::; o 7 enc ; don r e r ured baseand an ob — d - m uth. owl o the need of supplying the plane-tablers with points, and to the bad weal that prevailed, an empirical value for the longitude and latitude of the first s atton made from the base, namely Bidrang h, s. was assumed and on this value the plane-tabling was commenced. Later on a connection was made to an inter sected point of the triangulation carried into Seistan, by me, in ,899; and the values of the co-ordinates thus obtained were retained throughout the field work * The triangulation carried on in Seistan was merely to fix points for surveys on vanous scales; it was impossible, owing to a variety of circumstances to extend this work further to the north, west, or east. The work of the survey generally was carried on in such a manner as to excite, as little as possible, the attention of the officials (Persian and Afghan) or the suspicions of the inhabitants. ’ Opportunities, as they offered, were takan advantage of to re-observe angles or to strengthen all work as far as possible. In 1905 the following triangles were established, vis., Koh Khwaiah Palan gan( 2 ), Koh-i-Chako, and Koh Khwajah, Koh-i-Chako, Koh-i-Guch both beine figures covering large areas. In the first, the point Palangan ( 2 ) is an intersected point used as a station in 1899 and again in 1904-05. It was not possible to visit it on either the first occasion or on the last. In order to observe at this place luminous signals would be necessary on all lines to the north with one or two exceptions, as all are very much lower than it. It is situated at a distance from any well known route, and is not easy of access on this account. The proper name of this peak appears to be Chahil Dukhtardn. All computations of the secondary triangles have been made as to one copy. ***•»*, These triangles emanate from the side Koh-i-Chako—Koh-i-Guch, and a check is obtained a good way further to the south, on the side Koh Khwaiah— Sabzkim, computed from the general computations alluded to above, and also from the side Koh Malik Siah—Koh Khwajah of the triangulation of 1899 The triangle Koh Malik Siah—Koh Khwajah, Sabzkim h. s. contains only two observed angles. It was not possible to leave a luminous signal at Sabzkim and observe to it from the Koh-i-Malik. Owing to the great length of this side (about 75 miles) such observations could only have been possible in the very clearest weather • a large sized helio. would also have been necessary. The angle (unobserved), at the Koh-i-Malik Siah is in addition very small, being under 15 0 . The Bwhole difference between the side Koh Khwaja to Sabzkim, computed from the triangulation of Seistan ; and from the side Koh-Malik-Siah to Koh-Khwaja, is 14 feet in a length of 20 2 miles. A second comparison was made further to the south, on the side Koh-Malik-Siah to the interpolated station Tump-i- Mir Dost. In 1899 the latter was fixed for purposes of plane-tabling alone ; by observations to three known points, the centre point being Koh-i-Malik Siah. In 1904-05, this station of Tump-i-Mir Dost was connected with Koh- i-Malik Siah by triangulation, the angle at Koh-i-Malik Siah having been un observed, and also every acute. The whole difference in length of the side Koh- i-Malik Siah to Tump-i-Mir Dost, from the triangulation of 1899 and 1904-05, respectively, is 200 feet in a distance of 39 miles. The triangulation in the direction of the Koh-i-Malik Siah was carried on by Surveyor Jamaludin. It was not possible for me to be away from the main camp, for many reasons, and as I had also to lay down the straight lines of boundary pillars between points such as the Koh-i-Malik Siah and B. P. No. 51, close to the bifurcation of the Rud-i-Seistan and the Helmand (a distance of 86 miles), as well as further on towards the northern terminus of the boundary, the trian gulation towards the south was left to the Sub-surveyor just named, who carried it on satisfactorily until he was disabled by a fall from a restive riding camel owing to which he had to return to camp. It was due to this tnangulation that the extension, desired by the British Commissioner, towards the south, of the detail surveys on the scale of i'=i mile was rendered possible. The surveys on the scale of t v =4 miles were extended on all sides as far as possible, and every opportunity was taken advantage of in order to increase the area of this work. Thei'=i mile surveys were ordered by the British Commissioner in order to elucidate problems connected with the changes that have taken place in the course of the Helmand from Bandar-i-Kamal Khan downwards, in the past, as well as those which are now in progress. The delta of the Helmand actually begins at Bandar-i-Kamal Khan, and it was necessary to place on record, graphically, the various old channels that had once contained the river. There were also questions affecting these old channels and the possibility or otherwise of their being revived, by the con structions of weirs or dams across the river, or any attempts to tamper with its present course. Such points could only be dealt with satisfactorily when the detail had been rendered on a scale on which the irrigation officer was able to plot his levels. It was also considered to be necessary for military purposes. The British Commissioner desired it to be continued to theShela, the channel of communica tion between the present Hamun of Seistan, and the older Hamun known now as the Gaud-i-Zireh (the Hollow of Zireh). The accident to Surveyor Jamaludin, however, put a stop to this extension, as it was not considered advisable for me to visit those tracts, and there was no one else to do the work. Trigonometrical points were needed in order to keep the work up to the same standard as to • • A comparison was made in Seistan between heights obtained trigonometrically and others obtained by two Boiling point thermometers, and with a height taken carefully, in 1885, by the Afghan Boundary Commission, with a mountain Barometer. The trigonometrical heights show a defect of (in round numbers) 90 feet compared with both of the latter which appear to be fairly accordant. Trigonometrical heights were carried on by means of reciprocal vertical angles from the triangulation to the south of the Helmand executed bv the Survey officers of the Afghan Boundary Commission in 1885. The Irrigation officer connected his levels with Koh-i-Khwaja h. s. and the trigonometrical heights in Seistan also depend on the height of that station above mean sea level. Refraction in Seistan is very- great and in its effect is of opposite signs.3 quality, with the work in the more valuable portion of the delta. As these points could not be established, the i'=i mile plane-table was abandoned. In many respects Seistan is an unsatisfactory country to survey. After each season of flood, portions of canals are realigned ; channels made by the river in one year are materially altered by the floods of the next; village roads and even through routes are liable to change. Almost the only permanent detail is the eastern branch of the Helmand River called the Siksar, which being the boundary for several miles, is maintained by artificial means as a working channel, though it has long ceased to be a natural outlet of the river. The main canals also do not alter, very materially, and in the portion of the delta, enclosed between the Rud-i-Pariun (the western branch of the Helmand) and the Rud-i-Seistan (the main canal of Seistan) where there are permanent villages, the latter of course do not move, though frequently groups of agriculturists belonging to one or other of these villages may form a separate hamlet on the lands they hold. In every case also where the shores of the Hamun-i-Seistan are not formed by cliffs, the limit of the basin, or its outline, is the limit of the floods that find their way into it in various years. The western edge of the lake (Hamun) of Seistan is defined by cliffs of various heights ; and in that direction the talus which descends from the western hills forms the limit of the depression. To the east the alluvial of Seistan shelves gently down towards the lake, and in this direction there is nothing that can be regarded as the edge of the lake except the limit of the area actually submerged, which is liable to fluctuate between one year and another, as well as between the periods of low and high river in each year. As a general rule, however, the edge of the Hamun area toward the east has been regarded to be the limit of the flood of 1903, so far as it was possible to everywhere recognise it. Former channels of the Helmand also, have been laid down in the T'= 1 mile scale survey, wherever it has been possible to follow them up. The British Commissioner was of opinion that in the mile survey sheets, no heights should be entered which would give a clue to the fall or slope of the country towards the lake. The irrigation officer was to plot his levels on copies of the map in his possession which were to be treated as most con fidential. It was also desired that the whole of the maps on this scale were to be classed as secret. No drawing was possible in the field. I represented the fact verbally to the British Commissioner when in camp on the boundary line in the Sana Rud and he seemed not disposed to ta^e action on the matter. I subsequently mentioned the fact of the advantages that would have accrued if, as in 1896 on the Baluch Afghan Boundary Commission, there could have been a separate drawing establishment connected with the survey detachment. The strength of the latter after deducting casualties and transfers was no greater than of that detachment with the earlier commission, while the duration of the mission and the hardships attending it were on this occasion drawn out and prolonged for a great length of time. Such maps as w r ere needed by the Commissioner were, therefore, all that could be drawn in the detachment ; but every effort was made to render these of use in the compilation of the regular standard sheets on the i v =4 miles scale, and in the case of maps on the 1 =1 mile scale to render these as useful as possible for military and other purposes; no important or essential detail or information therefore, was omitted in the maps.4 The following is a list of the maps drawn &gt; Map of Seistan, scale i'=i mile 1903. Boundary from B. P. 52 to B.P. 65, scale i'=i mile, reduced from the original survey on the scale 2' = !mile by pentagraph, 1904. General map of Seistan and country adjoining, scale i'=4 miles, 1903. General map in four sheets, i' / =4 miles, 1905. This last named map was sent for publication through the Foreign Office in the current year. It has been carefully drawn with a view to be of service in compiling the regular standard sheets on that scale, into which the information would fall. The hills in these sheets were to be represented in brown, and they have been drawn separately on No. 5 drawing paper for this purpose, as well as all canals and interior detail of the Hamun which were to be represented in blue colour. The outline, names, and other details were to be reproduced in black. The hill shading on those sheets was executed with horizontal hachures, and every pillar of the boundary laid down from the Koh-i-Malik Siah in the south to the Koh-i-Malik Siah to the north has been represented in the appropriate sheets of the latest map on the scale of i '=4 miles. ****** The compilation sheets have been compiled personally by me, and they can be taken as originals as far as they go, having been carefully looked over. The western branch of the Helmand, the Rud-i-Pariun, has been surveyed on the scale of 2 // =i mile, and this survey is authoritative for an average width of | mile on the right and left banks. Within these limits conflicting detail ought to be adjusted on the large scale detail. ****** A series of experiments made for the purpose, showed the average magnetic variation for Seistan, the delta, and the adjoining dashts, to be 3 0 E. In the Hamun area, between B. P. 70 and the north terminal point of the boundary between Afghanistan and Persia, there were however considerable local varia tions, owing to which the alignment on the straight line of the boundary could not be carried on when the terminal point was obscured by bad weather except by theodolite traverse. The magnetic variations were as much as 15'the sign being—. This was not remarkable as the floor of the Hamun is alluvial soil, composed by rocks of all ages and formations having been ground down, the most finely divided portions of which have in the course of countless ages been washed down by the rivers which enter the Hamun and deposited as soil in the basin of this lake. Across the dasht, over which the straight line passed from the Koh-i- Malik Siah to the bifurcation of the Rud-i-Seistan and the Helmand, there were also considerably greater local variations of the same sign as those which were found to exist in the basin of the Hamun. When the alignment of the pillars towards the Koh-i-Malik Siah was instituted in September 1904, there was a period of bad weather, during which, in order to push on the work, the pillar sites were laid down by means ot magnetic bearings. Owing to the local disturbances, the work had to be redone with a theodolite. During this realignment, it was discovered that a good many of the pillars could be dispensed with, and so those pillars which did not need to be rebuilt5 were made into cajrns, th e dehrn of the boundary pillars that were not recon- s rue ed being used to form these subsidiary pillars, and they were lettered a of lld'h*'’ f h°' 'V S 3 P f r * Whi ' e ' 7 (a)&gt; 17 (b) ' and '7 (c) are cairns built of the of boundary pdlars, and in most cases these are not white-washed The straight line from the Koh-i-Malik Siah to the bifurcation (Pillar No c.) of the Rud-t-Seistan canal and the Helmand River passes over a waterless rum-covered desert. The task of alignment and of building was very arduous • water had to be brought from distances varying from 8 to 20 miles for man and beast, as riding camels on hard work need water as much as a horse does, and in addition the dasht was either quite destitute of vegetation, or the vegetation that had sprung up after the winter rains had dried up and contained no nourishment. Owing to this, fodder, tamarisk, etc., had also to be provided for the camels at work on the dasht. To the north of B. P. 5, the main channel of the Helmand forms the boundary, both parties having access to its water for some miles, as far north as the point where the great division of the waters of the river takes place naturally. At this place the Pariun and Siksar channels separate. The former is the western and the latter the eastern branch of the river, and the point of separation is the head of the present delta. In 1872 when the boundary between Persia and Afghanistan was first laid down, the Siksar branch of the Helmand was the main branch drawing to itself the whole of the discharge of the Helmand. It was decided upon as the boundary between those countries. By 1896 the Pariun branch developed and made its existence felt, and by 1903 the Siksar had dwindled down to a brook owing its existence to careful attention on the part of both Afghans and Persians alike, who by artificial means, had to maintain this channel in some sort of working condition as it formed the boundary. Owing to this and the danger of the Pariun drawing the Helmand into its channels, the existence of the Siksar branch from its point of separation, almost to its termination in the naisar to the north has been emphasized by means of boundary pillars, the great majority of which have been trigonometrically fixed These pillars are solidly built of baked bricks (obtainable anywhere in the country in great quantities from ancient sites), 10 to 15 feet in height numbered serially, and plastered and whitewashed. Ladders were made and from the summits of these pillars compass bearings were taken to prominent ruins, mounds, villages, or such trees as are conspicuous and likely to be in existence for some time to come. The slightest relaxation of the means adopted to keep a run clear for water to freely pass through the Siksar channel would fling the Helmand river forthwith into its western outlet, and once this had taken place, in the course of a year or two the Siksar channel would be completely effaced. But the line of boundary pillars so closely outlines its course that a straight line from one to the next to the north and south would still serve as the boundary. The country below the bifurcation of the two channels is a typical delta. Scarred by innumerable old beds and channels of the Helmand, it is to a very great extent covered with a luxuriant growth of tamarisk. The thickets attain very frequently to a height of 20 feet. The upper portion of this tract and those parts adjoining the branches of the river are liable to inundation according to the rise of the river. The Pariun or western branch of the He'mand forms a network of spill water channels, none of which are important, from a Survey point of view,tr I '' 6 as they change every year according to the volume of the flood in the Helmand. In 1903 the deepest of these channels was the easternmost which flows under the hamlet of Malaki which stands on its banks. The other channels are frequently so ill-defined that at periods of low river they are quite dry and it is not at such times at all clear what is a spill water channel or not. Again when the floods are at their highest point, the water flows over the low and gently shelving banks forming expanses of water with merely the tamarisk thickets appearing above the surface. Surveys made at various times of this narrow tract would give details that differ in every respect, and which to any one unacquainted with the country would give an idea that the conflict of detail was due to inaccuracy on the part of the surveyors. This however would be quite a wrong impression, and each of the various representations of the tract would be quite correct for the period when it was surveyed. It is necessary to emphasize this, and also to bear it in mind when the i'=i mile surveys are finally mapped, as there is a conflict of detail in the plane-tables of this tract. The representations of the spill water channels made in 1903 and I9°4 almost certain to be quite wrong by this time, as the channels themselves must have altered very materially, and appreciably on the scale. The rest of the 1'= 1 mile scale surveys have no such details of a conflicting nature. Slight discrepancies may have been overlooked in comparing the common edges of adjoining plane-tables, but these are capable of being adjusted easily ; they are also of no importance. In the southern sheets there are innumerable sites of prehistoric settle ments, of which of course no names can now be obtained. These occupy the summits of mounds of various heights and are represented. These sites ought to appear on the fair maps. They are of very great interest from an archaeological standpoint as palaeolithic implements have been obtained from them, accompanied by pottery. The mounds are also of very great interest to a geologist. Old beds or channels of the Helmand are also of very great importance. The river is in a condition of unstable equilibrium and there are indications of impending changes, which if they take place may revive any one of the old beds of the Helmand and bring it into importance after the lapse of centuries. In the £' plane-table to the east of the village of Chakansur, survey only has extended for a distance of about 20 miles. Beyond this towards Khash, sites marked on the plane table or on the published standard sheet are altogether based on information. But the Koh-i-Khwaja Ata has been fixed by plane table intersections, though not visited. It has subsequently been fixed by triangulation, and the plane table position of this most prominent feature in the country between Kandahar and Seistan should be corrected, if neces sary, by the triangulated values of its co-ordinates. Under existing conditions any further extension of survey work to the north, west and east of Seistan as a purely survey operation is unfortunately no longer possible. But in conjunction with political expeditions, either in co-operation with the Consul in Seistan or of course with expeditions, missions, etc., organised and despatched from India, a very great many opportunities for making surveys will be available. Any observations to the Koh-i-Khwaja, or Koh-i-Chako or the Koh-i- Kuch would need a heliotrope at those points as they are flat-topped hills,7 detached plateaus, which present no mark that could be recognised from a distance of over 15 or 20 miles, and then only if viewed from the low ground to the east. An escort would be needed for the heliotroper on either the Koh-i-Chako, or Koh-i-Kuch, and the consent of the Persian authorities in the case of the two first-named hills, and that of the Afghan authorities in the case of the Koh-i-Kuch. In observing across the Hamun, the burning of reeds by the cattle herds causes smoke which continues for days, and when there is no wind the atmos phere is rendered thick, and it is impossible under these conditions to pick up cairns. An ideal line for a series of triangles is the trade route from Seistan to Meshed, as the road passes up valleys with hills on either hand ; but here again such work is liable to be interrupted by the authorities, and in 1904 it was impossible owing to this, to extend the £' plane-tabling in this direction. NOTES ON COMMUNICATIONS (ROADS, FORDS AND FERRIES) IN SEISTAN. There are in reality no permanent roads in Seistan. As land is taken up General remarks. ^r the summer and winter sowings, and is irrigated preparatory to being broken up the tracks alter very materially. From January onwards, the Helmand (ordi narily) begins to rise and all the main canals to fill with water. This circum stance also causes changes to be made in the position of the tracks which adapt themselves to suit the altered conditions of fords, etc. The only well-marked track in Seistan was the road from the Mission Camp Road from Mission Camp to the City. ^ City. As the Persians used this road for their communications (post and telegrams, etc.) it was kept up to a certain extent and could generally be followed without any difficulty. With the rise in the Helmand and the increase of water in all canals, communication from one part of the country to another becomes very difficult for any one but horsemen or men on foot. Local trade is so small that neither camels nor mules are used across country. Moreover these animals are not kept in the country except a very few owned by foreigners generally residing in it. y Tracks generally proceed from one village to the next, the advantage of Description of tracks. keeping to such a route even though it be devious, is, that sometimes a bridge exists near one of the villages, over a deep and wide canal. A dry season track differs very greatly and is shorter than one which it is possible to follow in the period of an ordinarily high river. Mules of course can move more freely about the country where the majority of the villages are situated, than do camels. But even a single horseman has to be careful in crossing canals, to choose a ford which shows signs of being used freely by cattle. In the dry season, when the smaller canals contain little or no water, the villagers sink wells in the bed of nearest canal, and in order to save labour, as close to the ford or crossing as possible. Then when the canals fill, these wells become dangerous to all but those who are intimately acquainted with their exact position with reference to the crossings.: 8 The Helmand commences to rise (ordinarily) steadily from the first week in January; thence onwards to about Floods, duration of, etc. j u |y ever y canal contains water, every old bed of the Helmand fills with spill water from canals, and stretches of ground covering large areas, are sometimes rendered impassable by water owing to breaches in canal banks and embankments. From August to December the river is at a low level, and all canals as well. The distributaries being in any case quite destitute of water. , „ . There are four fords across the Pariun Fords in Seistan across the Parmn, or , , r l tt i j western branch of the Helmand. or the western branch ot the Helmand. Commencing from the north, these are—the ford of Daulat&amp;bad (also called the ford of Khamak), that at the village of Sami, near the old village of Margo, and known as the Margo ford. Next in order is the Malaki ford, and lower down is the ford of Shahgul. Between the last and the ford of Malaki is the Jahanabad ford, but the latter is not safe for baggage animals (camels), as the eastern approach is bad, and the bottom also, not good. There is also heavy jungle on the East bank. The other fords all afford a good foot hold to camels, though in each there is the deep water channel making a sudden drop of 2 feet or more. In the season of low river the latter alone is filled with water. The fords of the Rud-i-Seistan (the main or trunk canal of the cultivated district), commencing from the north, are as follows:— Fords on the Rud-i-Seistan. At Muhammadabad—a deep and bad ford, with steep banks. A ferry is maintained here by the people of the country. At Pulgi.—Owing to the breadth of depression filled by the canal at this point, the ford is practicable later and also earlier than others. The soil is sandy and the bottom is good, affording an excellent foothold for all animals and men alike. Kimak.—Similar to the above, but owing to the crossing being winding, animals need a guide to lead them across. This ford is not practicable as long as that of Pulgi, nor is it as good. A ferry is maintained here, as soon as the water begins to rise. Burj-i-Sarband.—This ford is open for a much shorter period than either of the above. A ferry is maintained here as soon as the water rises. In seasons of very low river, the Rud-i-Seistan is fordable in very many other places, but the above are well established fords, and tracks leading from the city to various parts of the country, cross at those points. The same remark applies to the fords of the Pariun. The Mian Kangi is the tract lying between the Pariun and SiksAr Mian kangi. branches of the Helmand. Owing to the dense growth of tamarisk, which covers the upper portions of this tract, communication is difficult. There is practically only one road in this tract that is kept up at all, and that is the pathway from Deh Dost Muhammad to Siahdak, and thence by Malaki, across the Pariun to the city. Along this pathway which winds through the jungle, the larger canals are bridged sufficiently well to allow of horses passing over, or donkeys, the sole means of transport kept in the country.9 Throughout the Mian Kangi camels can be used and can follow the foot paths with more or less difficulty ; canals may have to be bridged or their banks cut down. Tracks in the Mian Kangi are liable to greater and more frequent changes than those in the district to the west of the Pariun. From the months of April onwards to about July the Mian Kangi is, in years of high river, to a great extent liable to be flooded. The people have not the energy to maintain protective embankments, and when the floods subside there are very often large expanses of water and marshy ground in the bottoms of the old channels with which the face of the district is scarred. On the sheets of the =-\ mile survey of Seistan the tracks shown as practicable for camels are those which the Mission of 1903-05 used, or others which by personal inspection are known to present fewest difficulties, and on which local traffic is kept up. Owing to the Siksar branch of the Helmand being maintained artificially Fords across the Siksar or eastern branch Jj- j s both narrow as well as shallow, of Helmand. There is a ford at Deh Gulshah, to the north of Deh Dost Muhammad. It presents no difficulty as the stream is a few yards wide, but further north owing to the spoil banks and the deep and narrow channels the canalized stream is a formidable obstacle and impassable for all baggage animals between Deh Gulshah, and its junction with the Shela-i-Shamshiri about 400 yards to the north-west of Deh Hassan Kharot (Ghilzai) in Afghan territory. The next in order proceeding south is the ford across the Siksar at the village of Shekh Muhammad. Opposite this little village, and on the Afghan side of the rivulet, there stands the small village of Taj Muhammad. This ford and these villages are about miles to the north-east of the village of Deh Dost Muhammad. Further to the south there is a good ford across the Siksar branch of the Helmand opposite to the hamlet of Malik Dad. To the west of the huts com posing this hamlet is a single padag tree about 200 yards to the north of the ford. From this hamlet a road goes away to Kala-i-Kang in Afghan territory, the head-quarters of a sub-division. The hamlet of Malik Dad and the single tree are on the right or Afghan bank of the Siksar. Higher up the river the next well established ford over the eastern branch of the Hclmand is the ford opposite to the village of Deh Lalla, this village being about 300 yards from the left bank of the stream, in Persian territory. Higher up the stream there is a good ford across the eastern branch of the Helmand between Nad Ali and Milak; this however in periods of high river is not practicable for baggage animals, nor are the fords below Deh Gulshah. AFGHAN SEISTAN. To the north and west of the Afghan out-post at Kala-i-Kang, the Shela-i-Rudghashta, a canalised old bed of the Helmand, is a very formidable obstacle, so much so that a bridge is maintained between the villages of Deh Agha Jan about 2 miles to the north-west of Kala-i-Kang and that of Muhammad Jan about 3 miles further on in the same direction. To the south of Kala-i-Kang and between it and the outpost at Nad Ali, the Shela-i-Charkh is a very formidable obstacle as soon as the Helmand rises. At the Ziarat at Padag-i-Ghaus—so called from a grove of padag trees DIO surrounding the shrine, there is a splendid ford with good approaches and bottom, but when the Shela-i-Charkh, a canalised old bed of the Helmand, is full, there is too much water for baggage animals to be able to cross ; at this time a detour to the east needs to be made across low swampy ground where the waters of that canal spread out. The Shela*i _ Charkh is some qo yards across the water, and about 5° or 6 ° from bank to bank. The width of the Shela-i-Rudghashta high up between the villages of Malaghani and Rasul Khan, about 4 miles to the south-west of Kala-i-Kang is about the same as the Shela-i-Charkh. Lower down the former dwindles to the size of a large canal. The following technical terms peculiar to Seistan are to he found in the list of names in the various plane-tables of the surveys carried on there. They are ex plained below :— Names. E xplanation. *Tapa {e. g. Tapa-i-Siksar) Shela (e. g. Shela-i-Kafiri) Hamun (e. g. Hamun-i-Sawari) Chung A^hkin. # Ashkinak. Naizar. Gaudar. Shand. Arbu (sometimes called Harbu). Tag tDik (suffix) such as in the case Surhdik, the red hill. A mound ; generally formed by the dtbris of an ancient fort or group of dwellings: the word is never used in connection with a sand hill, though a natural mound is also called a Tapa. The word precedes the proper name. An old bed or channel of the River Helmand, or one of its branches. These are frequently canalised and used for irrigation purposes. Precedes the proper name. Any extensive expanse of clear water, too deep to allow of reeds and bulrushes growing in it is called a Hamun. This term is also applied to the lake of Seistan as a whole. A small expanse of clear water where there are no reeds and bulrushes. Lands which are submerged for a short time during periods of floods, which remain more or less in a marshy condition, but where there is not enough water for reeds and bul rushes to grow extensively. Diminutive form of above: A lesser Ashkin. Areas owing to their being sooner and more thoroughly dry are so called ; these are, however, flooded during the period of high river. Beds of reeds and bulrushes. Expanses of shallow water where both varieties of these aquatic plants luxuriate. Note. Narrow strips of clear water which connect one chung W1 th another are also called Shela, but their names have not been entered on the field sheets. Cattle herdsmen. The huts in the Naizar and Ashkin lands are used year after year in the seasons when they take the cattle to graze in the reed beds, etc. The more important are shown in some field sheets. There are two meanings to this word.
