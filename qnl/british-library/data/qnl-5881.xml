I, therefore, beg to confirm to you that the names of the aforesaid two tribesmen are Nasir bin Eahhad al-Qahtani and Murshid al-Buraihi al-Birzani, these are their observed names, and not as the ’Iraqi Government have reported of them, that they are: one Nasir bin ’Abdulla and the other Rashid bin Hadi. As for the evidence said to have been given by them: that Nasir started firing at the Police when he saw them, and that Murshid fired one shot in the direction of his companion before the Police talcing any action against them, and that smuggling was their profession. What we know, and that is the real fact, is that they never knew smuggling, neither before nor at the time they met with the Police in the low-lands of Sanam. According to Murshid*s report, Nasir did not take any hostile action against the Police, but the latter were the first to open fire suddenly and without warning. With the first volley Nasir fell wounded. He lay unconscious and died at night of that very day. When the Police seized the two men’s firearms, they at once fired through them. In fact we regret the misunderstandi^ng that had arisen. We are confident that a just government like our twin the Government of *iraq would never approve of such agression, the murder of an innocent man, and the plunder of hisof hsi camels and firearms without any justification.! would therefore request you kindly to reconsider the case and refer it to the British Embassy.

Koweit-Iraq Incidents. yx\ 3479 10871 (2) ■mRKrQM , In accordance with your instructions I proceeded to Basra and held an enquiry into the complaint of the Koweiti authorities that three Koweitis had Been arrested by the Customs autliorities in the Jihor al Sabi yah, i.e. in Koweili territory, and taken to Fao. The case in question took place on the 29th October, 1935. I examined the Assistant Preventive Officer and the Customs Police who were with him at the time of arrest. These witnesses give clear and independent evidence that at the time of arrest the Koweiti Safina was anchored near the bank and the three Koweitis were engaged in loading it with brushwood (shok), which they had gathered near by* The witnesses moreover stated that the place of arrest was about a mile distant from Um Q&amp;sr. In order to fix the exact spot where the arrest took place I proceeded to Um fasr and made the witnesses point out where the Koweiti boat had been moored* The witnesses pointed out a spot which I estimated was l-g- miles from Um . asr, (we reached this spot after travelling 10 minutes at a speed of about 9 miles an hour) and in any case the distance was under 2 miles from Um Qasr. I wished to fix the exact distance from Um Qasr as it would appear from the map (attached) that the land boundary cuts the right, bank of the Khor about three miles from Um. Qaer, leaving some three to four miles of this bank in Koweit territory. It is however the general belief, and certainly that held by the Customs Authorities, that the whole of the Khor Zubair is in Iraq territory. Xu may be mentioned that brushwood (shok) appears to be more plentiful in the vicinity of the alleged place of arrest than along the remainder of the right bank of the Khor Zubair, and it is stated further that this shok can be obtained also in pubiyan island and elsewhere on Koweit shores.

They were 3 persons driving 12 unloaded camels and were coming here to buy their provisions of rice, dates and some other requirements f When they reached at the eastern slope of the Liyah towards the end of Wednesday the 8th Jamad II 1555 (26.8.56), 2 armed cars carrying some policemen came upon them. The Police asked them where were they proceeding and to what tribe did they belong? They replied that they were proceeding to Kuwait to buy their provisions of rice, dates and some other requirements. The Police: 'You tell lies. You want to buy goods for smuggling'. The tribesmen: 'What is your proof against us for this charge? We are poor bedouins and do not know how to smuggle goods'. the police the latter laid them &lt;m the ground and started beating them without mercy, causing them to take much pain and t lling them at the same time to say that they wanted Today reached here some tribesmen who had been ihen the tribesmen addressed these last words to to carry goods for smuggling. Thus the police tried to extract the poor tribesmen's admission but failed at Ij^astlast and realized the truth of their first statement. Thereafter, the police left the tribesmen and proceeded tramping within the frontiers. The tribesmen arrived here today and came complaining to us of the bad conditions they are enduring fran the cars of the said Post. In fact, I am greatly distressed on account of these actions which they carry out without any regard. There is no doubt that such actions would only result in the disturbance of good relations existing between the two countries, which we do not like to occur. *e have often requested you to submit the case to the authorities concerned to stop these continued aggressions at the frontiers, and are anxiously awaitingTranslation of a letter No. S-5/259 , dated the 7 th Hajab^' 1355 (25.9.36) from His ibceellenoy the Huler of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait.

We were proceeding on the road that lead to our camp at Hinnabiya, with 15 camels which carried the provisions we had bought from Kuwait for ourselves and many of our tribe colleagues. The provisions consisted of the following:- 10 bags of rice, 7 bags of sugar, 4 bags of flour, 3 maunds of dates, 12 waqiyas of coffee, 6 waqiyas of tea, 3 waqiyas of coir ropes, and 3 water skins Of the above 2 bags of rice, one bag of sugar, six waqiyas of coffee and six waqiyas of tea belonged to our tribal chief Majid bin Jumai’an; 2 bags of rice belonged to aiuqair bin Farhan; the rest belonged in common to many families of the tribe, from one bag down. When we cam© to a point between Raudhat Ikhraim and Raudhat Umm al ^ish, four ears of the Safwan Police Post appeared to us. They opened fire on us from a di stance of about 50 fathoms. We were compelled to fly leaving the 13 camels and the provisions they carried. The cars captured the camels with their loads. After a few days we heard that the authorities in Iraq were going to sell our camels in public auction at Kubair.

Brit isii Embassy, Bagdad• 10th Septonbeiv 1936 yy dear Loch, Please see my t elegram No*27 about the alleged raid of Iraqi police into Kuwait on July 29th. I have now received de Gaury’s telegram of September 2nd from Karachi saying that, according to a written report from the Shaikh, two Iraqi police cars from Safwan made a raid on August 18th and got as far as HISSU ADH LHA.BI near LTfAK. I have taken it for granted that this second alleged raid is quite distinct from the one reported in your telegram of August 27th but I shall be glad to receive confirmation of this and shall await your detailed comments before considering whether formal action is desirable at this time. Meanwhile, as I found the Prime Minister in ratner buoyant mood on his return from the South, I gave him the details of both alleged incidents and asked him informally to prevent their recurrence and curb the exuberance of the Police at Safwan. I said I might have to return to the charge later when further details come to hand. The Prime Minister took notes of the dates and places aid pr omised to do as I nad as^ed. telegram from Karachi of September 8th about the alleged entry of the Iraqi Customs launch into Kuwaiti waters. I defer anything in the way of formal representations to the to look into them and take such action as he thought desirable Since writing the above, I have received de Saury's will try and get at the truth of this through the Director- General of Customs, Bagdad, who is a friend of mine, and vill tion of the evidence available. It must be the silly season. Y our s ev er, sd. C. H. Bateman. ieut.-colonel G.Loch,C.I.E.M' copy- (31/43/S 6) British Embassy, Bagdad. 21st Sept emb er, 193 6* ( ( ?.?) My dear Loch, Please se£ the last paragraph of my letter of September 10th (109/21/36) regarding the allegation made by the Shaikh of Kuwait that an Iraqi Customs launch entered Kuwaiti waters by the Western shore of Bubiyan Island near Bandar al Adnya on August 29th and 30th last. (Your c/179 of September h2th). The Customs people here, both British and Iraqi/ with whom I am on most friendly terms, were as good as tl^eir wcr d. / Having repeatedly told me that their preventive off/icers 1 b, ve the strictest instructions forbidding entry into Kuwait territory or territorial waters (and I have confirmed this as independently), they were/anxious as I ms to get at the truth. i They therefore sent post haste for the Customs logb. And this is the result. On August 27th, during daylight. Launch Ho.6, under preventive Officer Haji Abdul Rahman, went into the mouth of the Khor Abdullah. He returned that night to the depot at pao and remained there on August 28th and 29th* On August 30th he proceeded with the same launch to pick up 64 tins of sugar that had been dumped on the flats near the Fao salt works (i.e. in Iraq) and discovered by the police. This was the only mar ernent of Customs launches until September 2nd, when Ho.5 went on the usual patrols. This, you will see, is totally at variance with the information given by the Shaikh so far both as regards dates and places. I would like to mention that the Customs pe ople here (British and Iraqi) are quite positive that no Customs launch of / ut 0 -colonel G.Loch,C.I.E.- 2 - : c r \ V N //&gt;X 2 j ^ -trvy of three or four feet draught would venture under the command of an Arab far out across the Khor Abdullah even in daytime, and certainly nowhere near the west side of Bubiyan. This, not only on account of their instructions, but also because they are net sufficiently sea-minded* The same remarks apply a 1 or1 1 ori in regard to the hours of darkness or in anything like the uncertain weather that beats up in those parts suddenly* On the face of it I cannot help thinking that the Shaikh of Kuwait may have been led, not for the first time, unwitting ly tc give cover to smugglers who tadly need it. A careful sifting of the evidence is clearly necessary before any action becomes either possible or advisable vis a vis the Iraqi Government. Yours veiy sincerely, sd.

With regard to the other cases, a decision would be gven by the fommittee placing the responsibility either on Iraq or Kuwait and laying down what compensation or damages should be paid by the offending party.

In the first place, it would mean a delay in the actual signing of the notes which the Sauai Government would not understand, and might lead to various complications* If the Shaikh refused to accept our letter regarding our control over his foreign relations, I do not see how we could refuse to let the notes actually be signed. Moreover the Shaikh might convey the gist of our letter to Ibn Sand. 2. I think it would be preferable to return to the urnggestion made In my demi-official letter *o.lS-S * March 5th, 1936 to Sir Aubrey Metcalf e.

They all say that the eight men mentioned are Fidawis of the Shaikh of Kuwait. Fidawls are ordinarily paid only every three months and there is nothing unusual in that. The evidence of the mm given in the Baghdad despatch appears from my enquiries to be true. 3. I4o.l and Uo.3 (Falih and Aid) have usually been detached under orders of Shaikh ^bdulla al Jabir iibn Abdulla as Bubah) a cousin of the shaikhs who is President of the Sham* Court and Chief -administrator of Kuwait town, and pi id hy him out of the Town’s funds. They are therefore equivalent to Police Constables. 4 . His becollency has denied that they are his Fidawis in his letter ko.H/b/43, dated 2Pnd Anril 1936 (vide Kuwait despatch C~146 of the 1st May 1936) and night perhaps maintain that he had recently discharged them.

I had passed through and obtained permission from the Fao Customs the same evening. My load was palm branches and dates for the Shaikh of Kuwait. /hen I reached opposite and 300 yards off Bandar al- Adaniya, which is at the south-west corner of Bubiyan Island, I was, without hail or warning, come along side by a black launch. It was three o’clock Arabic of the night, a dark moonless night. The Mudir Y/as the only man who spoke. I know him. He is from Fao and I think is the chief man there and is called Hajji Ahmad. H e asked me where I was going and ordered me to lie to at Adaniya. The launch remained at the same place at dawn I asked leave to sail on and-it was given. The launch is somewhere about 20 foot long, a rather small one and painted black. There were four men with me:- 1* Matr Hassan, 2. Khalid Hassan, 3. Matrud, and 4. All.

After Compliments, On Saturday last 29th Sha’ahan 1555 (14th November 1936) two cars from the Police Station at Safwan came up to al Liyah, where they met some persons of Jahra, Kuwait suttfacts, who had been on their way to al Liyah depressions to cut bushes for firewood there. They (the Police cars) ordered them to make their camels kneel and according to their request they did so. There were five camels escorted by three persons and four camels escorted by two persons and. after the inspection the Police left them. 2 0 On the 12th of November Police cars took the camels of 3a’ad bin Salih and his brothers, Kuwait I subjects, at Hlssu adh-Uhabi. There were 18 camels, of ^ which five camels were restored and the balance the /• Police took off with them. 3.

Clausen The hon’ble Lieut-Colonel T.C.Fowle, Hriet s Co nsu 1 be ns ral, bushi re.Draft Kecord of a Meeting held at the Joreign Office on October 6th, to consider measures for dealing with frontier incidents between Iraq • and Kuwait* L- Mr* Rendel presided at a meeting at the foreign Office on October 6th which was attended by Lieutenant- - Colonel Fowle iPolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf) Mr. Walton and Mr Clauson of the India Offices and by Mr* baggalay, Mr. Ward and Mr* Williams of the foreign Office • Mr. Rendel explained that the meeting had to consider a proposal put forv/ard by Lieut-Colonel Fowle that a frontier standing committee might be set up to deal with both past and future frontier incidents. Lieu tenant-Colonel F 0 wle than outlined his proposal for a committee. The committee should consist of two members, the Political Agent at Kuwait attending on behalf of the Shaikh, and an Iraqi official, say the Mutessarif of basra, on behalf of Iraq, in the case of disagreement the Judge at basra ^at present Judge Lloyd;, a british subject in iraqi employ, should act as aroitra- -tor. be would have preferred an arbitrator witnout connexions with either party, but no auch person appeared to be available. judge Lloyd was eminently suitable and, as his appointment would be a great concession to rraq itmught reconcile the Iraqis to the scheme. The Committee should investifate both past and future '•incident* and he suggested that past indidents should be dealt with as follows:- If sufficient evidence regarding any incident should prove not to be availaole the2 the committee would make a declaration to that effect and the indiceat should thereafter be considered closed; if ou the other hand the committee found sifficient eivdence on which tooprenounce an opinion, they would record their decision and their decision would be considered as oinding on both parties; if the committee could not agree in any particular case. Judge Lloyd should be called upon to arbitrate* As regards future incidents he (Lieut-Golonel Powle} suggested that the members of the committee should meet as soon as possible after the indddent had been reported in order to investigate it on the spot and that in the case of dispute Judge Lloyd should again arbitrate. The trouble at present was that by the time the authorities on one side of the frontier had hadn apprised of an incident throught the inevitably circu- -itous diplomatic channel, the tine for proper investigation had gone by, with the result that nothing followed but and exchange of recriminations and denials. The frontier com- -mittee could, however, be on the spot within tow or three days, and this should lead toa great practical iraprovanent in the investigation of claims. He finally suggested that the ccsnmittee should be set up as a result of an exchange of letters between the Iraqi Government and His M gjesty's Gov- -ernment on behalf of the Shaikh. Mr. .*ard pointed out that, while such a plan mujjit be meet useful for future incidents, it would, he thought, only lead to difficulties to raise the question of the past in- -cidents. in the first place it would now be quite impo ssible/iiflpossii-ils to obtd.ixi iy reliable evidence about ixi- -cidents going back as far as 19 33. secondly, the raising by Kowei t of the question of past incidents, i.g. of Iraqi incursions into Koweit territory, would almost certainly cause the Iraqis to raise for their part the question of compensation for Iraqi police officers shot by smugglers. Mr. Rend el thought it important to draw a distinction between the procedure for dealing with past and with future incidents. reh two cases seemed to him to require quite different treatment, ^part from the fact that the Uraqis would probably not agree that past incidents should be investigated, it would be wiser not to jeopardise a promising plan for dealing with future incidents by insist- -ing upon the investigation of the past, ne then wei t on to suggest that the demarcation of the frontier should procede tha setting up af a committee and would at the same time provide a good peg on which to broach a suggest- — ion for the establishment of the committee. he thought that the frontier, which is laid down in documents and maps, could easily be demarcated on land by the use of beacons and buoys, not decessarily on the frontier itselt bu so placed as to give intersecting lines of direction as at the mouths of tidal harbours, etc. m almost all incidents of which one side or the other complained it was found that there was a complete difference of opinion as to the side of the frontier on which the occurrence had taken plane, uncertainty as t o the line of the frontier was in fact at the root of may of the frontier troubles, and a proper demarcation4 • (W demarcation seemed a necessary preliminary to a general improvement of Iraqi-Koweit relations. ijieut-Colonel Fowls agreed, pointing out that demarca ti on w ould probably have good py sue ho logical effect upon the Iraqis, who might hesitate to cross a clearly marked frontier, in might be possible to plough a furrow which could be supplements by pillars etc • Mr. Rendel thatn suggested that in that case the Embassy at Baghdad should be asked for their observations on the suggestions, and that the noyal Air Force authori- -ties should be asked to co-operate in demarcating the land frontier (since they had a trained personnel ready in the country) and Colonel Ward to advise on the demarcating of the boundart on sea. It should also be suggested to the Embassy that a committee ^ should be established to deal with future incidents on the lines suggested by hi sut-Colon el Fov/le. ihe Embassy should further be informed that the -‘-ndia Office considered it desirable (from the point of view of our relations with Koweit) to try to obtain some solution of the past incidents on the lines suggested by Lieut-Oolonel Fowls; but that in the Foreign Office view any investigation of past inci- -dents, if it should prove desirable to carry out such an investigation, should be carried out by a body entirely separate from that to be set up for dealing with future incidents. The comments of the Embassy on these last two suggestions also should be asked f or. j&amp;r • WardMr. #ard reminded the meeting that the Embassy were now opposed to doing anything to re-open the question of smuggling from Kuwait into Iraq pending a settlement of the question of the date gardens be longing to the ohaikh of Koweit in Iraq. -i-he danger was that by raking up past incidents we might ioa^e the Ixaqis revert to their smuggling grievances thus jeopardising the prospects of the new proposals for disposing of the date gardens problem. Lieut-E 0 lonel if owl e agreed snd said that he would not wish to put any pressure on the Iraqi Governaant to settle past incidents, if such pressure would en- - danger the prospects of solving the date gardens question, since this was clearly the most important issue• Mr. Hendel concluded by saying that the foreign Office woud draft a despatch to Baghdad on the lines agreed upon, for the concurrence of the India Office.CONFIDENTIAL.

He intended to see Lafi al 5hamali who was camping at Batiyah in order to take his goats which he had kept with him. On his way he was seen by some 5 or 6 motor cars belonging to Iraq Government who arrested them and took their camels on the ground that they were smugglers. They told them (Iraq officials) that they would have adopted a different manner if they were smugglers but they beat him (Muhaiamad) severely when they could not discover anything on him and told him to give them the names of the smugglers. /hen he told them that he did not know any smugglers they took him and his frisnd by car to Zubair where they were handed over to the Mudir at Zubair who imprisoned than for 12 days. Thereafter he was sent to Basrah where he was imprismec for 33 days. But his friend was released after remaining one month in prison at Zubair.

They are it appears unable to do so. They just said “the Police were dressed like Police* or *in coat and trousers* which was always a triumph for the Commandant* The Bedouins held to their stories and maintained their dignity in most cases. One did not. Luckily the Commandant failed to understand the meaning of the abuse and the threat to make him “as emasculated as he looked * f if he was seen over the frontier again.

British officials suggested a mixed commission representing both the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Iraqi Government, and authorized the investigation all the frontier incidents by land and by sea that had occurred between the two states since April 1933.The Shaikh of Kuwait raised his complaints to the Political Agent, Kuwait, about Iraqi customs attacking Kuwaiti nationals, and about tribesmen accusing them of smuggling. In turn, the Political Agent, Kuwait, shared the Shaikh’s concerns with the Political Resident, Bushire, and other British officials. On the other hand, reports were also sent by the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the British Embassy regarding the Iraqi Government investigating the incidents.The volume also contains correspondence related to meetings held between Iraqi and Kuwaiti delegations in few places in Iraq and Kuwait in order to discuss the incidents issue, as well as records of a meeting held in London to consider establishing frontier committee to investigate the incidents.Among other correspondents in the volume are the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Ruler of Kuwait, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, and the Secretary of State for India, London.The volume core correspondence covers the period April 1936 to February 1937. The earlier start date given for the volume is a result of correspondence related to the investigations made by the Iraq Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the depositions of Kuwaiti nationals, these are dated December 1935, (ff 138-145).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Safwan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Witnesses</topic></subject><subject><topic>Inspectors</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Fao</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Smuggling</topic></subject><subject><topic>Customs policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Territorial waters</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boats</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00004f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
