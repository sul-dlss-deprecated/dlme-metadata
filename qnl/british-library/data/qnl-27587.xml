Dear liajor iiay, » -^1 Please refer to your demi-official letter to Knight i r o.F.508-rl/e7, dateu the 9th February ^938. I enclose a copy of a report from the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, Ilo.1175-M.4076, dated the j.0th March 1958, from which it \.ill be seen that action against Mr. Kazeruni under section 107 of the Criminal Procedure Coae is v not feasible in the present circumstances. Fhe Commissioner of Police, Bombay, is keeping in toucii with mr. Kazeruni anu further developments in the matter will be reported to the Government of India if and as they occur. Yours sincerely, 3d/-. G. Files. or 5.R. hay, C.I.D., Deputy Secretary/' to the Government of India, hxternal .iffairs Department.Dear hlajor Hay, Yt I have to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 11th November 1937 regarding the above subject, which I have carefully read. Before dealing with the points raised in your letter in detail I would like to mention that Mr. A.A.Keyvani, our Consul in Bombay, addressed a letter dated the 24th May 1937 to the Chief Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Political and Reforms Deptt. in which a full history of the man and his activities was given. It seems probable that the local Government has not referred this matter to the Government of India and therefore you have not had an occasion to know all the facts of the case. I am enclosing herewith a copy of the letter in question for your reference from which as well as from what I have told you personally before, you will gather that the activities of this person if unrestrained are likely to kxxh: cause dis-satisfaction in the mind of our Government. It is also likely that they may lead to a breach of the peace consequent upon the resentment which is being felt by the Iranian residents of Bombay at the insult offered to our Government in the name of its officials. As an illustration of this resentment which was expressed at jthe wilful dissemination of scandalous matter contained kazeruni’s affidavit dated the 29th April 1937, I ^ .am enclosing a copy of a Resolution passed by an 0 i ? &lt; important..© important and influential association like the Iran League of Bombay, in which his action has been rightly and expressly condemned by that Society. 2. In connection with the mischief that Kazeruni has already done by means of his affidavit I wish to say that any direct action on our part by instituting legal proceedings against him will not, in my opinion, be a proper thing to do, for such an action against an insignificant person of Kazeruni's type will not be consistent with the position and status of a consul. And I am inclined to think that taking advantage of this fact Kazeruni is continuing in his irresponsible conduct fearlessly. 3. As for the various points raised by you in your letter under reply I would like to say a few woras about Kazeruni*8 assertion that both the last and the present Consuls at Bombay owe him money. If ills claim against the Cx-Consul were a bona fide claim, there appears to be no reason why Kazeruni did not take legal steps, for the recovery of the money, against the Consul before he left Bombay. There is still nothing to prevent him from taking such proceedings either heue in India or in Iran. He could have, if he so chose, made a representation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Teheran through this Consulate General for the settlement of his claim. He las done EDEtxjiJax neither which shows that he has absolutely no claim against the Ex-Consul; but in order to slander him out of spite, Kazeruni is broadcasting abroad that Mr. All Abadi owes him money. 4. As regards Kazeruni's claim against the present Consul for Rs.470/- plea.se see his explanation given by ..by Mr. Keyvani in hie letter dated the 24th May 1937 referred to above* The facts as given therein are such that Kazeruni cannot challenge their accuracy* 5. In regard to his alleged complaints mentioned in Para 1 (d) of your letter the matter has again been misrepresented to you. Because in accordance with the service and leave rules of the ministerial staff of the consulate, Kazeruni ms informed before his departure for Iran that if he overstayed his leave of one month, his post would automatically lapse. He overstayed his leave and at trio expiry of the first month he was finally informed through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Teheran, that his services had been dispensed with, and that another permanent incumbent ms appointed in his place. Under these circumstances the question of accepting his resignation by our Bombay Consulate cannot arise at all. o. With regard to his statement that he has not been furnished with a charge sheet it is not necessary to go into details. But it will suffice to state that he insisted on leaving Bombay at a time when his duties demanded that he should remain there, for, at that time, our Minister for Foreign Affairs was expected to -arrive in Bombay and Kazeruni *s presence there was urgently required. Apart from what lias been said above, before his departure for Iran, Kazeruni was Actually informed in writing that several complaints had been made against him by Iranian subjects to the effect that they had been unnecessarily harassed and excessively charged for passports, consular certificates and other documents which were issued to them by him. There were even actual complaints against him, which are believed to be true, that he had received fees without Issuing passports and other documents. He was accordingly called upon,,to give an explanation about these complaints before he leftxix for Iran, which he did not give. 7. Moreover, he was in debt and even before hie leaving for Iran several complaints were received by the Consulate from firms and privaxe individuals claiming money from him. He did not settle with his creditors in spite of his being asked to do so; and even now the Consulate keeps receiving letters from his creditors asking them to help them recover their money from Kazeruni. J'or an example I am enclosing here with a copy of only one letter, out of several, from the Chicago Radio Company, received by the Consulate, from which you will be able to conclude as to wh^t can be the feelinfc of the Consulate over this matter. Tills very fact alone was sufficient for Kazeruni f s instant dismissal. 8. It is for these reasons that he has been foroidden to enter the premises of our Bombay Consulate; and I think you will agree with me that there was ample justification for both his dismissal and the order forbidding hi, t to enter the Consulate premises after the manner he h &gt;d behaved hir self while in the service of the Consulate# And referring here to Para 2 of your letter where you state that Kazeruni is said to have become embittered against the Iranian Consular Officers concerned for the treatment which he has received at their hands, I would like to say that he has no reasonable cause for any hx bitterness against the officers concerned for he Was rightly and justly dealt with by them. His post was purely local under the sole authority of the Consul with full right to retain or dispense with his services. Kazeruni'• Case has been fully considered oy t.*e mistry at Teheran and by myself, and we see no reason to upset the order of the Consul. 9, 'f Kazeruni published any book as he intends to do, it is likely to be of ihe same character as his affidavit; a nd it is certainly incompatible with and adverse to the dignity of the Consulate that such a boox should oe allowed to be publishedpublished. And we naturally look to the Governnent of India to inform Kazeruni of the consequences of such publication; and I trust that they will kindly see that no anti-Iranian propaganda of a scurrilous nature is allowed in this coun- try. 10. In addition to the matter having been referred to the Government of India* it w 9 s also represented by the Ministry of foreign Affairs to His Britannic majesty’s Minister in Teheran, who was good enough to promise that he would move the Government of Inaia that they snould taKe suitable action to prevent Kazeruni publishing the book. And therefore I feel confident that in view of the cordial relations which the Iranian Govern, ent has always had with His Britannic iAajesty’s Government, the Govern; ent of India will accord to us some preference over Ka^erum in dealing with this matter. 11. With reference to Para 3 of your letter where you say that Kazeruni is a British subject, I would like to point out that he travelled to Iran on an Iranian passport, and he is also registered in the Consulate at Bombay as an Iranian subject under Carte djfiidentite No. 3731 dated 1st Khordad 1310 corresponding to 22nd A ay 1931. And besides, from the language of the British Nationality and Status of AhgGV 13 ACt 1914, it can be safely inferred that a person bom within His Majesty’s dominions of alien parents, un less such person has divested himself of his parents’ nationality, cannot be regarded as a British subject. 12. in regard to Para 4 of your letter where you opine that no legal action can be taken against Kaxeruni, 1 venture to say that I regard this question from a different point should of view in as much as if the Government of India/feel really inclined the.y would be able to put a stop to the activities of ilazenuni by pressing upon him the inadvisibility of publishing such a book and the consequences that are bound to follow..\ to follow from such action. In conclusion 1 trust that in view of the fore going facts the Government of India will kindly take neces sary action in the matter. Yours sincerely, 3d/-G. R.

This meeting of the ianaging Committee of H The Iran League * a t Bombay, expi'esaes it^s deep disapproval of the action of ^r. Nasaroolla Fatollah Razarani in circulating in Bombay, an Affidavit dated 29th April 1937, affirmed before the Off. Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, a copy of which was sent to Sir Hormasj i 0# JDinshah Adenwala, Kt. , .V.O.f O.B.E. This meeting considers the references to the Ex- Consul ?. r.

Heza Snah Pahlavi in Bombay, and suoiuit that they a re strongly resented by many Persia of India, who have read the same. This meeting holds the following allegation* as highly indignified and insulting to H.I.:A.Reza Snail* s Consul and the Government of Iran:- 'The sorry treatment meted out to me in return by the very Consul and Government for whom I worked so hard and unselfishly, has caused me to decide to sunder myself completely from everything smelling of this Consulate and Iran.

True Copy. Sd/ Secretary. 1 -8 -37.'T Bombay, 24th May 1937. Sir Charles Turner, K.Q.I.3., CUS»I V ' Chief Secretary to the Gk)veiiimerit ; of^Somb^/ Political and Reforms Department.*7 *| q J i / i Sir, JSM^J I have the honour to write this letter to you in connection with the activities of one Nasrulla Fatoola Kazerani who now calls himself Nasrulla Fatulia Kazmin. For some time this man has been openly engaged in maligning the G-overnment of Iran and its representatives in Bombay and recently he has passed all bounds of decency by making in a Court of law unfounded defamatory and scandalous allegations against the representatives of His Imperial Majesty in India both past and present. £bb One Mr. Frank Dias, an Advocate, purporting to act on behalf of Kazerani has sent to this Consulate a copy of the affidavit, alleged to have been made by Kazerani in the Esplanade Police Court. A copy of the said affidavit and copy of the letter of the said Advocate are enclosed for your reference. A perusal of the affidavit will show how unfounded and deliberately false are the allegations contained therein and what must be the motives of a man who stoops to practices like these. In this connection may I draw your attention to the History of Kazerani. He had been working in this Consulate for about 5 years and when his services were dispensed with in December 1935 he acted as Secretary to this Consulate in Bombay* Numerous complaints were received by the Consulate about the mal-practices of Mr. Kazerani in connection with his official duties and at the time when Mr. H.Piraazar, the ex-Consul for Iran in Bombay was transferred Mr. Kazerani was recommended by the Government of Iran for dismissal. The next Consul Mr. W A. S.Aliabadi however, gave Mr. Kazerani a fresh chance and allowed him to continue in service. Mr. Kazerani, however, abused thejtrust tnat was placed in him and continued in his evil ways and numerous complaints both by Iranian and other subjects were laid before.o....before the Consul. The Consul in turn reprimanded Mr. Kazeranij. but aa to no avail* Finally when Mr.Kazerani found tnat he had gone too far and that steps would betaken against him, he applied for long leave which was refused to him. He then requested that he be given leave for one month.only. Although the Consul would have been justified in refusing this leave also in view of the circumstances and the allegations against him which were being inquired into, yet as a matter of grace he was granted one month’s leave on the distinct understanding that if at the expiry of that period he did not return to duty, his services would be deemed to be terminated. He left Bombay andkid not return for over 8 months and his post, after intimation to the Government of Iran, was duly filled up. It is entirely incorrect that during the period he was in Iran he was either watched as a British spy or arrested, questioned, searched or interrogated as he alleges in his affidavit, On the contrary he went about freely, inter viewed officials of the Foreign Office and made scandalous allegations against his officials in Bombay which on inquiry found to be false. At that time I was preparing to proceed to India and Mr. Kazerani approached me in Teheran, requested to be taken back in service and expressed his desire to accompany me to India. I refused and stated that his application for re instatement would be considered on its merits after I had taken charge in Bombay and had made an enquiry into the charges against him. I refused Kazerani permission to a ccompany me from Iran to India. ^Vhen I arrived at Zahedan on the Baluchistan Frontier on may way to India I found Mr. Kazerani also there together with a lady whom he called his wife. They were also t rattelling to India. I could not speak or understand English properly. I I was also ignorant of India, never having travelled in India before this trip. Mr. Kazerani offered^to help me on my way to Bombay. Npt suspecting any ulterior motives I accepted his offer of help and the party travelled together to Bombay. Indeed even if I had forbidden it, there was nothing to prevent him from travelling by the same train to Bombay. I had no Indian money at the time of my arrival in India and the political Agent at Nokundi suggested that I shouldr not change fiiy money at Nokundi at&gt; an unfavourable rate of ex change but that I should wait till I arrived in Bombay. The said Political Agent very kindly arranged with the Hailway authorities for myself and my family3and entourage to entrain fo Bombay, without paying the Railway fare at Nokundi. Without my knowledge the oehefit of this arrangement was also extended to Hr. Kazerani and the lady travelling with him, apparently under the false impression created by Hr. Kazeran that he was on my staff. 3 On arrival in Bombay on the 27th[1936 I immediately got money from my Bankers and paid a sum of Rs.jOO/-/- to Hr. Kazerani for the Railway fares. No account has been rendered by him of this sum but from inquiries instituted by me recently, it appears that from the sum of Rs.500/-/- entrusted to Mr. Kazerani, he not only paid the railway fare of myself and my family amounting to Rs.476/11/0 but also paid a small part cf his own fare. Mr. Kazerani has recently had the impudence to suggest that he paid my fare and he has falsely demanded the moneys from me and has threatened proceedings. A copy of that said letter is also sent herewith. This is a deliberately false and malicious claim and lias been made for the first time since the 30th of April 1937. a copy of my reply to the said letter is also enclosed herewith. Reverting to 1936, on arrival in Bombay I investigated tne clrim to reinstatement of Mr. Kazerani and found the cnarges against hia^very grave and substantially oorrebt. There were also good reasons to believe that Mr.Kazerani was actively, helping several designing persons who nad started a cram cazrjhign of villification against Idle late Consul Mr. Aliabadi and there were further reasons to believe that it was at tie instigation of Mr. Kazerani that certain proceeding were taken in the 3mall Causes Court at Bombay against Mr. Aliabadi. In passing it may be mentioned that as a result of these proceedings the Government of Iran lodged a protest to your Grovernment and diplomatic representations were made to the Government about the result of which you must naturally be aware. In the course of my duties I reported all these facts to the Government of Iran and instructions were received from the Government that Mr. Kazerani f s services should not be utilised again. Mr.Kazerani was informed of this decision and from y that ••••••••that time onwards he has adopted a hostile attitude towards the Iran G-overnment in general and this Consulate in puds±£B±xx±£ particular. I could give you numerous instances of harassment and of deliberate mischievous propaganda. All these matters have been and are reported to my Government and my Government desires me to express its resentment against the continuance in India of this vindicative campaign against the representatives of a friendly power. This Consulate and the Government of Iren uptil now ignored such vile attacks, but as continuance of these attacks might be considered by Iranian subjects in Bombay to be a sign of weakness on the part of this Consulate and might tend to embitter the feelings of the Iranian coinnunity i in Bombay against Mr. Kazerani and certain others who are incited and instigated by Mr. Kazerani and might even lead to a breach of the peace some day, I have been instructed to write to you and request the Government through you to see that such unseemly attacks are not allowed to continue. My Government, while having no desire to interfere with the due administration of the laws of India, feels that acceptance of affidavits containing irrelevant and scandalous allegations by British Courts can. ot lead to furtherance of justice or vindication of British laws. This Consulate hopes that applications of this sort will not be tolerated in future by the Government or any of its subordinate officials. This Consulate advisedly does not desire to give detailed replies to tne various allegations in the affidavit but if necessary ample proofs will be submitted for substantiating #hat is stated in x this lebi/er. One point DHisy only needs clearing at this stage. Mr. Kazerani grx states that he has sent several letters and telegrams containing his grievances to me. The only letter received from him by this Consulate, is a letter of 15th March 1937, copy whereof is sent herewith. About Mr. Kazerani*s false claim against me personally it is also hoped that instructions will be issued which will prevent any untoward incident such as happened at the timeMr. Aliabadi left India. V Information received during; the last few days from various quarters show that copies of the said affidavit are bein^ distributed freely amongst the Iranians and foreign subject. 3.

Mr. Kazerani who appears to have some grievances against the Iranian Consular Officers is considerably embittered against them and has adopted an uncompromising attitude in this matter. As he is a British subject by birth, it is not possible to take action against him under the Foreigners Act, III of 1864. Yours sincerely, 5^. C.w. A. Turner.

Lettsr Reocivi:j 237071237@ A copy of a report from the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, No.4796-M.4076, dated the 22nd October 1937. * 2.Mr. Nasrullah Patullah Kazerani, or Nasrullah Fatullah Kazmin as he now prefers to call himself, has twice been interviewed by the Dy: Commissioner of Police, Special Branch. His grievances, as stated to this officer, are:- (a) that the ex-Consul owed him certain monies AM which have yet to be^paid and that the present Consul also owes him a sum of about Rs.470/- which he (Nasrullah) advanced on account of travelling expenses of this officer and his party from Nokundi to Bombay in July last year and '(b) that whilst he has been forbidden to enter the Iran Consulate premises for some months past Am and his resignation, which^submitted in April (?) last has not been accepted, he has not been furnished with a charge sheet by his Consul neither has he been informed whether he has been dismissed, suspended, compulsorily retired or deemed to be on leave. 3. For these reasons he is considerably embittered and, being rather strongwilled, has decided to write a book relating his treatment ait the hands of the Iranian Consular Office and also by certain Consular officers. The book has not yet been commenced as he has recently had his septum operated on and is about to undergo a further operation for sinus trouble. His /presentpresent resolve is to start writing the book as soon as he feels fit again. It was pointed out to him that he stood to gain little or nothing by publishing matter which must, inevitably, be taken exception to by the Iranian government but his view is that he has been so unjustly treated and his ’izzat* so impaired that nothing short of the publication of his book, which he proposes to entitle 'I R AN!*, will salve his conscience. 4. ' The question of his deportation, in case he proves truculent and obstinate, does not, I think, arise. He has produced a certified copy of his birth certificate showing that he ms born in Bombay City on 25/12/97 and a passport issued to him(and still in his possession) by the Iranian Consul for Bombay on 4/11/35 also shows his nationality as British. As regards the latter he may, of course, ir^his capacity of Secretary to the Iranian Consul of Bombay, at the time, have been able to arrange this particular endorsement to suit his oi^nds. In any event we are not in a position to refute the evidence of his birth in Bombay as proved by the certificate produced. 5. In vie*v of the circumstances of the case and the non-compromising attitude of Mr. Nasrullah Fatullah Kazmin I would suggest, that the matter be allowed to rest for the moment and further develop ments awaited. In the meantime perhaps the head of the Iranian Foreign Service inTehran might be requested to review the whole case as it is likely that if his grievances, if real, are redressed to some extent, he may be dissuaded from rushing into print. n2/ i araonal.

With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No.922, dated the 14th August 1937 and ay conversation with you on the 3rd November 1937, I am desired to inform you that it haa been ascertained that Kazeruni's grievancea are as follows (a) that the ex-Conaul for Iran at Bombay owed him some money which has yet to be repaid and that the present Iranian Consul also owes him a sum of about us.470/- which Kazeruni says he advanced on account of the travelling expenses of this officer and his party from Nok-Kundi to Bombay in July last year; (b) that he h&amp;a been forbidden to enter the Iranian Consulate premises; that his resignation, which was submitted some time ago, has not been accepted; that he has not been furnished with a cbirge sheet by the Consul, and that he has not been informed whether he has been dismissed, suspended, compulsorily retired or deemed to be on leave.V m 2 m 2* ’or these reasona Kazeruni is said to have become embittered against t^te Iranian Consulfir Officers concerned and it is understood that he now intends to publish a book entitled 'Iran 1 setting forth the treatment which he has received at their hands* He has not yet be^nn to write the book* 3* He appears to be a British subject as his birth certificate shows that he was born in Bombay on the 25th December 1897.

Ho. Uttar , -P,confidential. Copy of a latter from the Consul for Iran at Bombay dated the 24th May 1937. I have the honour to write this letter to you in connection with the activities of one Nasrulla Fatoola Kazerani who now calls himself Nasrulla Fatulla Kazmin. For some time this ajan has been openly engaged ± in maligning the Government of Iran and its representatives in Bombay and recently he has passed all bounds of decency by making in a Court of law unfounded defamatory and scandalous allegations against the representatives of His Imperial Majesty in India both past and present. One Mr. Frank Dias, an Advocate, purporting to act on behalf of Kazerani has sent to this Consulate a copy of the at fidavit alleged to have been made by Kazerani in the Esplanade Police Court. A copy of the said affidavit and a copy of the letter of the said Advocate are enclosed for your reference. A perasal of the affidavit will show how unfounded and deliberately false are the allegations contained therein and what must be the motives of a man who stoops to practices like these. In this connection may I draw your attention to the history of Mr. Kazerani. He had been working in this Consulate for about o years and when his services were dispensed with in December 1935 he acted as Secretary to this Consulate in Bombay. Numerous compalints were received by the Consulate about the mal-practices of Mr. Kazerani in connection with his official duties and at the time when Mr. H. Pirjgfoazar, the ex-Consul for Iran in Bombay was transferred Mr. Kazerai was recommended by the Government of Iran for dismissal. The next Consul Mr. A.3. Alibadi however gave Mr.Mr, Kazerani a fresh chance and allowed him to coniine m service. Mr. Kazerani, however, abused the trust that was placed on him and continued in his evil ways and numerous complaints both by Iranian and other subjects were laid be!ore the Consul. The Consul in turn reprimanded Mr. Kazerari but to no avail. Finally when Mr. Kazerani found that he had gone too iar and that steps would be taken against him, he applied for long leave which was refused to him. He then be requested that he/given leave for one month only. Although the Consul would have been justified in refusing this leave also in view of the circumstances and the allegations against him which were being inquired into, yet as a matter of grace he was granted on&amp;month's leave on the distinct understanding that it at the expiration of that period he dia not return to duty, his services would be deemed to be terminated. He left Bombay and did not return for over 8 months and his post, after intimation to the Government of Iran, was duly filled up. It is entirely incorrect that during the period he was in Iran he was either watched as a British spy or arrested, questioned, searched or interro gated as he alleges in his affidavit. On the ^contrary he went about freely, interviewed various officials of the Fo reign Office and made scandalous allegations against his officials in Bombay, which on inquiry were found to be false. At that time I was preparing to proceed to India and Mr. Kazerani approached me in Tehran, requested to be taken DacK in ser/ice and expressed his desire to accompany me to India. I refused and stated that his application for fein- stateraent would be considered on its merits after I had taken charge in Bombay and had made an enquiry into the charges against him. I refused Kazerani permission to accompany me from Iran to India. WhenWhen I arrived at Zahedan on the Baluchistan Frontier on my way to India I found Mr. Kazerani also there to gether with a lady whom he called hia wife. They were also travelling to India. I could not speak or understand j£nglish properly. I was 5 also ignorant ol India* never having travelled in India teiore this trip. Mr. Kazerani offered his services as an Iranian subject and ofiered to help me on my way to Bombay. Not suspecting any ulterior motives I accepted his offer of help and the party travelled together to Bombay. Indeed, even if I had forbidden if, there was nothing to prevent him from travelling by the same train to Bombay. I no Indian money at the time of ray arrival in India and the rolitical Agent at Nokundi suggested that I should not change my money at Nokundi at an unfavouraole rate of exchange but that 1 should wait till I arrived in Bombay. Pne said rolitical Agent very kindly arranged with tae Railway authorities for myself and my family and encou rage to entrain for Bombay without paying the Railway fare, at Kokundi, Without my knowledge the benefit of this ar rangement was also extended to Mr. Kazerani and the lady travelling with him, apparently under the false impression created by Mr. Kazerani that he was on my staff. On arrival in Bombay on the 27th July 1936 I imme diately got money from my bankers and paid a sun of Rs. 500/- to Mr. Kazerani for the Railway* fares. No account has been rendered by him of this sum but from inquiries instituted by me recently, it appears thnt from the sum of c.500/- entrusted to Mr. Kazerani, he not only paid the railway fare of myself and ray family amounting to Rs.476-11- , , . own but also paid a small part of his n fare. Mr. kazerani has recently had the impudence to suggest that he paid my fare ffare and he has falsely demanded the monies from me and has threatened proceedings. A copy of the said letter is r'lso sent herewith* This is a deliberately false and mali cious claim and has been made for the first time on the 30th letter ZApril 1937. A copy of my reply to the said/is also herewith enclosed. reverting to 193o f on arrival in Bombay I investigated the claim to reinstatement of Mr. Kazerani and found that the chargee against him were vary grave and subs i antially cor rect. There were also good reasons to uelieve that Mr. Kazerani was actively elping several designing persons who had started* a campaign of Tildigi villifioation against the l^'.ei? onsul Mr. Aliabadi and there were further reasons to believe that it was at the instigation of Mr. Kazerani that certain proceedings were taken in the Small Causes Court at Bombay against Mr. Aliabadi. In passing it may be mentioned tnat as a result of these proceedings the Government of Iran lodged a protest to your Jorernment/(about the result of irfudi you must naturally be aware. In the course of my duties I reported all these facts to the Government of Iran and instructions were received frcm the Government that Mr. Kazerani’s services should not be utilised again. Mr.Kazerani was infonned about this decision and from that time onwards he has adopted a hostile attitude towards the Iran Government in general and this Consulate in particular. I eould give you numerous instances of harassment and of deliberate mischievous propaganda. til these matters have been and a re reported to my Government and my Government desires me to express its resentment against the c ontinuance in India of this vindictivevindictive campaign against the representatives of a friendly power. This Consulate and the Grovernment of Iran uptil now ignored such vile attacks, but as continuance of these attacks might be considered by Iranian subjects in Bombay to be a sign of weakness eS the pa£t of this Consulate and might tend to embitter the feelings of the Iranian Community in Bombay against Mr. Razerani and certain others who are incited and instigated by Mr. Kazarani and might even lead to a oreach of the peace some day, 1 have been instructed to write to you and request the Grovemment through you to see that such unseemly attacks are not allowed to continue. My government, while having no desire to inter fere with the due administration of the laws of India, feels that acceptance of affidavits containing irrelevant and scandalous allegation by British Courts cannot lead eitrier to furtherance of justice or vindication of British laws. This Consulate hcQpes that orders will be issued for expunging this affidavit from the records of the Court where it may have been filed and further this Consulate hopes that applications of this sort will not be tolerated in future by the Government or any of its subordinate offi cials. This Consulate advisedly does not desire to give de tailed replies to the various allegations in the affidavit but if necessary ample proofs will be submitted for subs tantiating what is stated in this letter. One point only needs cl earing a t t his stage. Mr. Kazerani states that he has sent several letters and telegrams containing his grie vances to met The only letter received ifrom hi« by this Consulate is a letter of 15th March 1937, copy whereof is sent herewith. About Mr. Kazerani^ false claim against me personally it is also hoped that instructions will be issued which willwill prevent any untoward incident such as happened at the time Mr, Aliabadi left India. Information received during the last few days from various quarters show that copies of the said affidavit are being distributed freely amongst the Iranians and foreign subjects. Please acknowledge receipt of this letter and plfiise iniorm me as to the steps your Grovemment propose to take in the matter. ACCOMPANIMENTS. Copy of a letter Mr. N.F. Kazerani, Rashid Mansion, Colaba, Bombay, to the Consul for Iran, Bombay, dated the 15th March 1937. Finding that your illegal, wrongful and high-handed actions against me ever since our arrival in Bombay are being continued by you in a very irresponsible and arbit rary/ manner and knowing for certain that justice cannot be had from your Government, I have decided to seek it from other quarters. For this reason and for the other reasons which ought to be best known to yourself I have to request you to immediately remove my name from your Consulate’s register of 'Sadjels' and to let me know of your having done so, failing which 1 shall be compelled to take, in this matter too, such other rightful and legal actions which may not be very agreeable to your Country and the Nation. My w Sedjel , ‘ number is 3731 and my wife’s is 3732, both issued in Bombay. They are being returned to His Imperial Majesty through the proper and desired channels.Re. one Stamp. Court Fee. True Coyy Frank Dias. Advocate. IN THK fiSPLANADi POLICA COURT AT BOMBAY. Affidayit for ghaiige of Hame. I» Nasroola Fatoola Kazeraru, of Iranian parentage, born and bred up in Bombay» residing at Rashid Mansions, Colaba, do say on solemn affirmation and state as follows 1* That I have been the Secretary to His Imperial Majesty's Consulate of Iran in Bombay for a period of nearly eight years, having first joined the appointment in or about the year 1929. 2. That throughout my services as Secretary for these eight years I have always carried out my duties satis factorily and corscientiously and in the opinion of all worked I have the Consuls under whoqji I kacri^been considered 'indispen sable*' to the Consulate as documentary evidence will prove. 3. That in the middle of the year 1935 being wearied by my continuous and indefatigable services ftom morning to night under an eccentric Consul, Mr. Abdos bamad Aliabadi, I was compelled to apply for six months' leave which was certainly due to me* The said Consul however would not hear of my going on leave as he opined that in such a case the work of the Consulate would be considerably and seriously hampered. After persistent entreaties and threats of resignation the said Consul agreed to grant me one months leave on three conditions. Firstly a cable in this matter was to be sent by the Consul to the Fo reign Ministry at Tehran at my expense thou^i worded and dictated by the Consul. Secondly I had to return to duty after a month, and thirdly I had to appoint three substi tutes in my place who were to be paid out of ray salary, while the balance, if any, was to be refunded to me.It w&amp;a in.poaaibie to obtain my passport without agreeing to these most eccentric conditions. Two of the substitites ^ I appointed myself while the third was suggested by me. This third person, MIA. Kazerani, the present incumbent was appointed on my suggestion, as though unfortunately my brother. I was not on taking terms with him. Ttiese were the only three persons in Bombay whom I could get to take up such temporary jobs as substitutes for a month on paltry salaries. I had to bear the expenses of sending cables drafted by this eccentric Consul to the Foreign Ministry at Tehran making me out to be a British s^y, and documentary evidence will prove these conditions under whicn alone I could get my leave. I proceeded on leave on the 8th November 1935, leaving Bombay the same day. 4. From the moment of my arrival in Iran I was watched as a British spy. I was stopped, taken to Police stations, arrested, questioned, searched and interrogated at various places and until my documents proved me to be otherwise. Throughout my stay in Iran and until the final decision I was constantly watched by the Secret Police as a British jp/t thanks to the cable of this eccentric Consul. I had to request His Imperial Majesty for a Court of Inquiry and after an investigation carried out by the Officials at Teheran it was decided to recall immediately this eccentric Consul, Mr. Aliabadi, while I returned as Secretary with the newly appointed Consul, Mr. Ali Asfehar Keyvsni. The lolice investigations necessitated my remaining at Tehran for nearly 8 months. o. That I came oack to Bombay on the 27th July 1936, from Zahedan to Nokundi the new Consul and his family travelled down with me in my car. At Nokundi we all had no cash and 1 had to pledge my car with the Hailway authorities as security for payment of all our travelling expenses. Right down from Mokundi to Bombay all the travelling expenses of thethe New Consul, his farnily and servants were borne by me and are still to be recovered by me. All alon£ the h journey and to all officials we met I was styled as his Secretary by the New Consul. On our arrival in Bombay the new Consul commissioned me to take charge of all his luggage vhioh had arrived in Bombay as well as what was due to arrive later and I sent the same across to him subsequently. It was mutually arranged between the new Consul and myself that 1 should stay away from the Consu late until Mr. Aliabadi left Bombay. The old eccentric Consul deliberately delayed handing over charge of the Consulate to gam time to prejudice the new Consul against me. 6. Ih&amp;t during this period an article appeared in the Bombay Chronicle under the signature of 'Patriotic Iranians' attacking the general conduct of Mr. Aliabadi. Mr. Aliabadi took this chance to blame me as the writer of the article. On the day of his departure, Mr. Aliaoadi was arrested by a bailiff of the dmall Causes Court, Bombay, for a decreed debt due by him to one Dr. -Khan. It appears that Mr. Aliabadi againx blamed me as being at the bottom of his arrest, ^en according to mutual arrangement I went back to the Consulate the day after Ir. Aliabadi left Bombay, the new Consul falsely reproached me for disgracing the name of the Consulate by getting a Consul arrested and informed me that as Mr. Aliabadi had made a formal complaint in the matter to him and had wired also to the Foreign Ministry at Teheran, he hiaiself was com pelled to report this incident to Teheran. He further instructed me to stay away from the Consulate and await the report of the enquiiy at Teheran. 7, That I may state here that Mr. Aliabadi is indebted to me in the sum of nearly Rs.iOOO/- to the knowledge of theV new Consul and the Iranian government which aua. is due to me towards salary and expenses incurred by me at the Consulate and sum he stiilff owes me. Further I have no statement of account of the salaries paid in ray absence to my substitufcbs nor have I received a rupee as salary or allowances since I left Bombay. I myself could have nad Mr.Aliabadi arrested for moneys due to me if I so chose. I may add here that at while I was^Iran, this eccentric Consul spread a rumoiar in Bombay firstly that I was arrested and hand-cuffed as a British Spy and thereafter that I was shot dead as a Britisn Spy. On ray return to Bombay ray friends were surprised to see me alive and hale and hearty; and the warn welcome I received on my arrival will testify toihalr great esteem and love for me. 8. Ihat I have always tried to safeguard the prestige of the Consulate during the tenure of my Secretaryship, and the British government, its Judicial and Police Officers and Consulates’ official documents will testify to my indefa tigable efforts to preserve the sactity of tne Consulate and its officers. Latterly I have comraunicated ray grievances to the Consul and the Iranian Crovemment by several latters and telegrams, but I have had not a singly reply probably be cause they could not extricate themselves from the mess they have caused. Uy last letter to the Consul was an intimation to him to remove ray name from the ConsutJtds register of 'Sedjels', thereby indicating my severance from his country, but this letter too has not been answered? Being unable to get any satisfactory explanation at all from the Consul and the Government I have oeen most re- ? luctenatly compelled to take this last resource of put ting on affidavit my grievances. The sorry treatment meted out to me in return by the very Consul and Govern ment for whom I worked ao hard and unselfishly has caused me to decide to sunder myself compbtaly frorc: everything smelling •smelling of this Consulate and Iran. Consequent upon this decision I have resolved to tender my resignation of the office of Secretary to the Consul for Iran which I have done by my lawyer’s notice sent this day to the Consul for Iran. Further I have decided to change my name for the above reasons and do hereby declare iaxxfcai that henceforth I renounce the name of Nasroola Fatoola Kazerani by #iich I have hitherto been known as I do not wish to be connected with '’Kazeran or Kazeroon' or anything Iranian, and I henceforth adopt the name of Nasroola Fatoola l^azmin which shall be my name in future.

I have the sad duty of readnding you once again about your not having paid me the su^i of Rupees Four hundred seventy six and annas eleven (Rs.476-11-0) paid by me to the B.B.&amp; C.I. Railway so far back as on 27th July 1936 being the railway oharges from Nokundi to Bombay for your self, your family, servant and luggage. Apart from several other claims that 1 have against you in which matters I am issuing instructions to my Solicitors, I have to request you to be good enough now to pay up the aforesaid anount of Rs.476-11-0 forthwith on receipt of this letter. I am sure you would not now put off this matter any further as long time has is already assed off and surely you are not disputing this fact. I am sanguine you will realise the same and not put me any further inconwenience and additional trouble lor recovering the same.Copy of a letter from Mr. A. A. Keyvani, Consul for Iran at Bombay to N.F. Kazerani, Esquire, alias N.F. Kazmin, dated the 24th May 1937. I refer to your letter of the 30th ultimo to me. t* In the ordinary course 1 would not have replied to the same but in view of your propensity for mischief I am writing; this letter to you to deny your claim against me. Your letter is but another step in the campaign of villification that you have undertaken against your Go vernment and its representatives in India whom you are attempting to bring into disgrace. This is a most disloyal act on your part. This interference is apparent from the fact that your letter under reply arrives a day after you made a certain affidavit in the police Court containing false and scandalous allegations against me personally and the late Consul for Iran. About jaour claim xtxlx itself it was the lolitical Agent at Nokundi who arranged for my travelling from Nokundi to Bombay. You accompanied me on the #ay under circumstances it is not necessary t^ detail just now. For the railway charges I paid you in cash in Bombay a sum of Rs.500/- on the day of my arrival here i.e. on 27th July 1936. Thereafter on several occasions you assued me that you had paid off all the charges of the Company but you did not produce to me any receipts or show an account how you had utilised the said sum of Kb. 500/-. It now appears that you have paid trie sum of Rs.476-11-0 only and that you have not accounted to me for thex balance. This is the correct position regarding your claim whichT which I am recording here. Not once have you aaked rae that I owed you any monies for railway fares or otherwise. Kith reference to the 2nd paragraph of your letter since you cannot specify any claims against me it is clear you are t rying to concoct other claims in pursuance of your present policy. I regret I cannot enter into any further correspon dence with you on t is or any other subject where I am concerned personally and I trust you will spare me the trouble of reading any further letters from you on the subject. Copy of opinion of the Remembrancer of Legal Affairs to the Government of Bombay, No.l33-Confl., dated the 24th June 1937. The question for consideration of the Remembrance^ of Legal Affairs is whether Government can order that the affidavit in question should be expunged from the records of the c ourt and instruct the courts not to record such affidavits in future. 2. It appears that one Mr. Kazerani made an affidavit (p. 37 ante) before the Offg. Presidency Magistrate with the avowed object of changing his name, but he introduced into this affidavit certain matters relating a history of his relations with the Iranian Government and its Consuls. The statements contained therein are said to be defamatory and the Consul fax of Iran taices exception to t hem and requests Government to order the affidavit to be expunged from the records of the court. 3. An affidavit is a statement or a declaration in writing on aath or affirmation before a person having authority to administer oath or affirmation (Sarkar’s Evidence Act, 5th edition, p.1239; see definition of 'affidavit' in section snqSect!on /3(3^) of the General Oauses Act, 1904), Section 4 of the Indian Oathe Act, 1873, provides inter alia that all the courts and persons having by law or consent or parties authority to receive evidence are authorised to adminis ter, by themselves or by an officer empowered by them in this behalf, oaths and affirmations in the dischan e of thr-dutiftt er in ixerciae o_r the powers im oaed u t on th «n res.^e_cli v ely py law. Section 139 of tile Civil Procedure Code provides that in the ease of an affidavit under thi s iioie - (a) any court or magistrate, or (b) any officer or other person whom a High Court may appoint in this behalf, or (c) any officer appointed by any other court which the Local Government has generally or specially empowered in this behalf may ad minister oath to the deponent* Order 19, rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code provides that any court may at any time order that any particular fact or facts may be proved by affidavit. Section 539, Criminal Procedure Codei provides inter a lia that affidavits and affirmations to be used before any High Court or any officer of such court may be »worn and affirmed. In the present case the affidavit in question was neither under the Civil procedure Code nor one to be used before any High Court or any officer of such court und^r the Criminal Procedure Code. The question, therefore, would be whether the Magistrate was authorised by any other law to allow such an affidavit to be sworn. 4. The avowed object of this affidavit is to change the name, but the law prescrioes no rules limiting a man’s liberty.....liberty to change hie name; he may aasune any name he pleases in addition to or substitution for his original name, and in adopting even the name or comoination of names by which another persons is already known he does not commit a legal wrong against that persons. The law concerns itself only with the question whether he has in fact assujfced and has come to be Known by a name different hs from that/which he was originally knwon (Halsbury Laws of England, Vol.23 at p.555). It is, therefore, clear that n$ affidavit for such a purpose would be needed. The affidavit in question contains a statement threatening the Iranian Consul withdeforcement of a claim in a civil court. Even for such a purpose no affidavit would be necessary. It appears, therefore, that the Magistrate had no power to receive such an affidavit. 5. Affidavits should be confined to matters pertinent and material and they may be ordered to be taken off the file if scandalous and irrelevant matter is inserted (Osmaston v. Association of Land Financiers, tf.N. 1878, p.1910) or they may be expunged by the Court before wham the affidavit is made or by the Court of Appeal (Earner v. Mosses, f.N. 1881, p.69). The affidavit appears to contain certain matters defamatory to the Consuls and consequently even if the Magistrate had powerto allow an affidavit for change of name to be made before him, he should have ordered the scandalous nmtters to be expunged. However, govern ment have no power to redress the grievance, for it would be interfering with the discretion of the Magistrate. Ihe best course would, therefore, be to ask the Iranian Consul to approach the Magistrate or the High Court to order the affidavit to ba removed from the file or to order the objectionable and irrelevant statements contained therein to be expunged.Copy of Grovernmont letter in the ioiitica.1 and Hefonna Department No. 1790/34-A, dated tne ora July 1937, to the Consul for Iran at Bombay.

D.O.No.782. Holly Lodge, Simla. The 20th July 1937. Dear Major Hay, In continuation of the conversation that I had with you yesterday the 19th instant, regarding Nasroola Fa too la Kazeroni I am sending you herewith a copy of the affidavit filed by him in the Esplanade Police Court, Bombay, for your perusal from which you will see the objectionable and irrelevant statements he has made in the affidavit in question. I take Itt££ objection to these statements on the ground that so far as Kazeroni has any monetary claim against the Consul it is purely a private matter between the two of them and for which the fonner is at liberty to seek redress in a Court of law, but the unnecessary inclusion of such statements in the affidavit that refer to our Government imply an open vilification of the Government without any cause whatsoever. In view of thes&lt; facts I am to request you to kindly move the Government of India to order the Court concerned to expunge from the record the irrelevant and objectionable statements contained therein. Yours sincerely, Sd. G. R. Nourzad. Major W. R. Hay, C.I.E., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, Simla.Re.one Stamp Court Fee.

That throughout my services as Secretary for these eig^it years I have always carried out my duties satisfactorily and conscientiously and in the opinion of all the Consuls under whom I worked I have been considered 'indispensable' to the Consulate as documentary evidence will prove. 3.

It was impossible to obtain my passport without agreeing to these most eccentric conditions. Two of the substitutes I appointed myself while the third was suggested by me. This third person, M. A. ..• •- 2 - M*A« Kazerani, the present incumbent was appointed on my s u @§6£&gt;tion, as, though unfortunately my brother I was not on talking terms with him. These were the only three persons in Bombay whom I could get to take up such temporary jobs as substitutes for a month on partly salaries. I had to bear the expenses of sending cables drafted by this eccentric Consul to the Foreign Ministry at Teheran making me out to be a British Spy, and documentary evidence will prove these conditions under which alone I could get my leave. I proceeded on leave on the 8th November 1935, leaving Bombay the same day. 4* From the moment of my arrival in Iran I was watched as a British Spy.

I had to request His Imperial Majesty for a Court of inquiry and after an investigation carried out by the offi cials at Teheran it was decided to recall immediately this eccentric Consul, Mr. Aliabadi, while I returned as Secretary with the newly appointed Consul, Mr. Ali Asghar Keyvani* The Police investigations necessitated my remaining at Teheran for nearly 8 months. 5. That I came back to Bombay on the 27th July 1936. From Zahedan to Nokundi the new Consul and his family travelled down with me in my car. At Nokundi we all had no cash and I had to pledge my car with the Railway authorities as security for payment of all our travelling expenses.

When according to mutual arrangements I went back to the Consulate the day after Mr. Aliabadi left Bombay, the new Consul falsely reproached me for disgracing the name of the Consulate by getting a Consul arrested and informed me that as Mr. Aliabadi had made a formal complaint in the matter to him and had wired also to the Foreign Ministry at Teheran, he himself was compelled to report this incident to Teheran. He further instructed me to stay away from the Consulate and await the report of the enquiry at Teheran. • That I may state here that Mr. Aliabadi is indebt ed to me in the sum of nearly Rs.1000/- to the knowledge of the new Consul and the Iranian Government which sum is due to me towards salary and expenses incurred by me at the Consulate and sum he still owes me. Further I have no statement of account of the salaries paid in my absence to my substitutes nor have I received a rupee as salary or allowances since I left Bombay. I myself could have had Mr. Aliabadi arrested for moneys due to me if I so chose. I mayjadd here that while I was at Iran, this eccentric Consul spread a rumour in Bombay firstly that I was arrested and hand cuffed as a British Spy and thereafter A my friends were surprised to see me aliveand hale and hearty; and the warm welcome I received on my arrival will testify to their great esteem and love for me. 8. That I have always tried to safeguard the prestige of the Consulate during the tenure of my Secretary ship and the BritishBritish Government, its Judicial and Police officers and Consulates' official documents will testify to my indefatigafc able efforts efforts- to preserve the sanctity of the Consulate and its officers. Latterly I have communicated my grievances to the Consul and the ian Government by several letters and telegrams, but iZh&amp;ci not a sii^le reply probably because they could not extricate themselves from the mess they have caused. My last letter to the Consul was an intimation to him to remove my name from the Consulate's register of 'Sadjels' thereby indicating my severance from his country, but this letter too has not been answered. Being unable to get any satisfactory explanation at all from the Consul and the Government I have been most reluctantly compelled to take this last resource of putting on affidavit my grievances. The sorry treatmentjneted out to me in return by the very Consul and Governmentjfor whom I worked so hard and un selfishly has caused me to decide to sunder myself complete ly from everything smelling of this Consulate and Iran. Consequent upon this decision I have resolved to tender my resignation of the office of Secretary to the Consul for Iran which I have done by my Lawyer's notice sent this day to the Consul for Iran. Further I have decided to change my name for the above reasons and do hereby declare that henceforth I renounce the name of Nasroola Fatoola Kazerani by which I have hitherto been known as I do not wish to be connected with 'Kazeran or Kazeropn' or anything Iranian, and I henceforth adopt the name of Nasroola Fatoola Kazmin which shall be my name in future.

Dear Monsieur Nourzad, With reference to the correspondence resting with my demi-official letter No # D.3016-N/37, dated the 23rd July 1937, I am desired to say that it is r^queeted that owing to legal difficulties the Government of India are unable to aceede to your request to have the objection able portions expunged from the affidavit of Kazeroni. The position is that the officer before whom an affidavit is sworn is not concerned with its contents. His function is confined to administering the oath or affirmation to the person making the affidavit and recording that fact on the document. The affidavit merely because it is sworn before Magistrate does not form part of any judicial proceedings and the Magistrate has no power to expunge any portion of it. Nor has he any means of doing so because the affidavit in original' does not ranain in the custody of the Magistrate but is taken away by the person making it. If however any person considers that an affidavit contains any libellous matter concer/ning him it is open to him to institute appropriate proceedings agarra against the individual who has made it.

In accordance with the views expressed by the Government of India in their letter in the Foreign Department No.762-E.A., dated the 27th March 1900, the officers and servants of a Consulate are not entitled to the special immunities granted to Ambassadors oT Diplomatic Agents, and they are not at liberty to disobey evade processes issued by Courts in British India. The Government of India have also stated that the officers of the British Government should be instructed to abstain, as far as possible, from any act which might interfere with the busi ness of the Consulate, or cause personal inconvenience to the Consular Officer. The Government of Bombay have accordingly correspondence cited in the margin, regard ing the execution of a warrant issued by the Court of Small Causes, Bombay against Mr. Abdossamad Aliabadi, late Consul for Iran at Bombay, and the protest made by the Consulate for Iran at Bombay issued ... •issued instructions to the Courts in the Bombay Presidency, in order to prevent inconvenience to Consulates and as a matter of courtesy, that surrmonses should not be served on foreign Consuls or their employees direct by the Courts but should be sent for service through Government who forward them to the Consular officers with covering letters, 3, In the present case, though Mr, Aliabadi ceased to be the Consul for Iran at Bombay on and from the 27th July 1936, kaS) the Government of Bombay, in view of the fact that he wHi still in the Consular service of the Government of Iran, decided that he should be treated as if he were still a Consul while in Bombay. Accoroingly, the summons in duplicate issued by tne Court of Small Causes, Bombay, requesting Mr. Aliabadi to personally appear in the Court at 11-30 A.M. on the 12th August 1936 to answer the action brought against him by Dr. E.M.Ahan, was sent to the Consul for Iran at Bombay on the 11th August 1936, with a request that the sunmons should be served on Mr. Aliabadi and the duplicate copy of it returned to Government duly signed by him. The Consul in his letter dated the 12th August 1936 intimated that the contents of the summons were duly conveyed to hr, Aliabadi and that Mr. Aliabadi denied tae claim brought against him by Dr. Kahn. The Consul said that Mr. Aliabadi was leaving for Iran on the evening of the 12th instant under urgent orders from the Ministry of Forei^i Affairs, Teheran, but that he (the Consul) would be prepared to submit the claim of Dr. Kahn if substantiated to the linistry of Foreign Affairs, Teheran. The Consul did not return the duplicate copy of the sunmons as requested by Government, but a copy of his letter was forwarded to the Chief Judge of the Court of Small Causes, Bombay, for information. 4. Mr. Aliabadi did not leave Bombay on the evening of the 12 th instant, but on that of the 13th instant. He did not attend ....attend the Court and an ex-parte decree was passed against him on the morning of the 13th instant. The Judge was apparently of opinion that Mr. Aliabadi wanted ±k to evade the payment of the decretal amount, and ordered inmediate execution of the decree and despatcned a bailiff with a warrant to intercept Mr. Aliabadi as he went on board the steamer. 5. The Consulate for Iran at Bombay has now protested against wiiat it calls an outrage on diplomatic privileges of a representative of a friendly State, and asks that those responsible for the incident should be properly .nd adequately punished and that a suitable apology rendered to the Consulate. The conmunication from the Consulate was not in the usual form of a letter addressed to the Chief Secretary to tne Government of Bombay, Political and Reforms Department, and the form of unsigned memorandum used was clearly intended as a display of deliberate discourtesy. Experience has lea this Government to believe that many Foreign Consuls are prone to overlook the fact that in British India the executive authorities have no power over the judiciary in the exercise of their judicial powers, and are apt to take statements to that effect made by executive officers as mere excuses for their failure to assist them. 6 . The Government of Bombay consider that tne action taken by the Court subsequent to tne decree was judicially correct and in conformity with the instructions contained in the letter from the Government of India in the Foreigi Department No.762-E.A. dated the 27th March 1900. In the circumstances, the Government of Bombay propose to inform the Consulate that though Mr. Aliabadi had no legal claim to ...«to diplomatic privilege, the Government of Bombay did their best to implement the assurance given that Mr. Aliabadi should have all diplomatic courtesies; but that the final decision lay with the Judge, and Government could not interfere with his decision.warn 2448 Telegram R., No.96, dated 5th (r^cd 6th) September 1936.

The Court either disregarded re quest or did not receive it in time and at instance of plaintiff ordered immediate execution of decree and despatched bailiff with warrant to intercept Aliabadi as he went on board steamer. 3. Bombay Government point out that Aliabadi even had he been Consul at time (which he was not) was not entitled to diplomatic privilege and was subject to jurisdiction of Civil Courts. Latter were requested by executive Government to tare certain action as matter of courtesy but final decision rested with Court and Government could not interfere with that decision which appears to have been judicially correct. 4.

Final decision how ever lay with Judge and Government could not interfere with that decision. Do you agree to this reply being given or would you prefer that reply should be merely that matter is being dealt with through diplomatic channels at Teheran. (M. f'.S. D.S.P. J.S. J.S..JED.

Nourzad, Imperial Oonsul-General for Iran in India* To, The Secretary to feie Government of India in the Foreign and political Department, Simla. Sir, 1 have the honour to state that a Dr.E.A.K&amp;han of Bombay alleged to have a claim pgainst Monsieur A.S. Aliabadi, late Imperial Consul for Iran at Bombay, and instituted a suit in the Small Causes Court for the recovery of the amount due to him. The Court passed an ex-parte decree in favour of plaintiff for the exe cution of which a warrant of arrest was issued on the 13th August 1936 against Monsieur Aliabadi. In order to execute the warrant the pi intiff accompanied by two v i c.J~o y bailiffs of the court went to the Qivtoria DocJts on the afternoon of the 13th August, from where Monsieur Aliabadf was to embark for Iran. As the cayfaiich conveyed Monsieur Aliabadfc to the Docks arrived there it was approached by the plaintiff and the two bailiffs who demanded payment of the decretal amount from him in a most aggressive manner. Thereupon Mr.Petigara of Messrs. Mulla and Mulla, Solicitors, was handed the amount of the decree for payment, under protest, to the bailiffs on the spot, who were told that Mr. Petigara was acting £8 Solicitor for Monsieur Aliabadi; but the bailiffs at first refused to accept the amount from Mr. Petigara and insisted on it being paid \)j Monsieur Aii a p a di himself. I am further to add that early on the same day (13th August) the Secretary to the Imperial Iranian Consulate, Bombay, had twice seen the Under Secretary to the Government of Bombay in the political Department ■iSKwith regard to this matter* and the latter had given assur&amp;noe that nothing untoward would happen. -And this assurance was further confirmed by the Department on the tele®i*one by saying that a representative of the Government would be sent down to the Docks to call off the bailiffs* but unfortunately the assurance thus given was not carried into effect. The facts of the case relating to the claim of Dr# Kahan are that he had agreed to accept K^SOO/- for medical attendance which amount was duly paid to him by Monsieur Aliabadi* but despite this contract the Doctor put forward a fresh claim for a further i&amp;# 532/14/- inclusive of costs of the suit. In view of the foregoing facts it is a m tter for greatjsurprise th t in order to satisfy the frivolous and unsubstantiated claim of a person such indelicate . treatment should be shown to the representative of a friendly state, especially in the circumstances when his counsel had offered the money to the officers of the Court, who would not accept it and unreasonably insisted that it should be handed to them by Monsieur Aliabadi alone; and in spite of the fact th-t the Political Department was fully acquainted with the details of the case. Ihey are at least supposed to recognise the fact that even after the departure of Monsieur Aliabadd the Bombay Consulate or this Consulate-General, or eventually His Imperial Majesty’s Government would not fail to acknowledge the proved claim of a person brought against the representative of that Government. It is therefore regrettable that no timely action was taken by the local Government to prevent the occurrence of this outrage on the person of the Consul. Having 'gt&lt;rd to the most cordial relations which subsist between theJtwo neig^i'bouring states, the Bombay Government ou^it to have taken appropriate action in the matter, because an affront of this character to the representative of a friendly country is bound to cause resentment and surprise. In the circumstances of the case His Imp- rial Majesty’s Government feel that the action of the local authorities is open to objection; and, therefore, they request the Government of India to kindly ask those v/ho have been responsible for this regrettable incident to tender an epology to the Bombay Consulate itB occurrence; othervdse if cases of a similar nature should come to pass in Iran, the Government would decline to int ervene in the ma 1.1« r• I have, etc., Sd/- G.R.

The Persian Minister called on me this evening under instructions from His Government, to make representations about an alleged incident affecting the Persian Consul at Bombay. 2. According to M. Ala’s account, the Persian Consul at Bombay, M. All Abady, who had recently been recalled to Tehran, had, prior to his recall, become involved in some kind ol lawsuit, which, according to the Persian Government, had been engineered against him by the intrigues oi local enemies under the leadership of a German named Herr Kahn. As a result, the court had decided against M. Abady, and ordered him to pay a sum of 450 Rupees. The Persian Government regarded this, I gathered, as a complete miscarriage of justice. In view of M. Abady’e Consular status some arrangement had apparently been made by which the matter should be referred to what the Persian Government described as the Foreign Department 01 the Government of Bombay. M. Ala was, however, very vague as to the nature of this arrangement, and it is difficult to see how ic could in any case have superseded the decision of the court. But when M. Abady was on the point of embarking from Bombay on his final departure for Persia, he was stopped by officials of the court and compelled to pay the full amount. The Persian Government wished to protest very strongly against this incident, and were asking for a formal apology. 3. I told M. Ala that, on the facts as he had stated them, it seemed to me that the Persian Government had no cause for formal complaint. Consular officers were amenableto the jurisdiction of the local courts and could not claim any exemption therefrom, although in practice we naturally did our beet to make thinge as easy as possible for them. If the Persian Government’s contention was that there was a miscarriage of justice, they would have to show first that all the local legal remedies had been exhausted, and would have to have a strong prlma facie case to show that the action of the court was in fact unjustifiable. In any case it seemed to me that a formal protest and demand for an apology were quite inappropriate in a case of this kind. We should of course in the first place have to obtain a detailed report. Meanwhile it seemed to me that the proper course would have been for the Persian Government to make informal enquiries on the subject, rather than put forward formal demands for apologies, etc., which ai^it only make the situation more difficult. 4. M. Ala then explained that the matter had already been raised with His itfajesty’s Legation at Tehran. T explained to him that, while I was always at his disposal to discuss any subject affecting Anglo-Persian relations, it seemed to me that great confusion was likely to be caused by this frequent duplication of channels, flo doubt Ur, Butler had already taken the question up with the Government of India, and it was only likely to cause confusion and difficulty if they were approached from this end as well. 5. M. Ala appeared to appreciate the force of these arguments, but said that he would be very glad if we would let him know in due course the result of our enquiries into the matter.
