Foreign , M.C. Foreigi Office, London Lond on.Mr. Donaldson In his letter flagged below Pry has sought the views of the Foreign Office on the question of the issue by the Government of India of diplomatic passports. In British practice there is no such thing as a diplomatic passport. At present Government of India issue what they call a 'Foreign Secretary's letter” to intending travellers of status. Fry hints that if India introduces diplomatic passports the demand for them is likely to be great and one gathers the impression that India would grant these documents fairly freely^ Ttirfauli fchim umifld hmwHic dhiifeg 'Of hr i naatei so freely/ as to detract eventually from their value. What the Government of India have, in effect, asked for are the pros and cons of issuing diplomatic passports and Dunbar's lucid statement makes a strong case against granting them. His argument that it would be practically impossible to confine diplomatic passports to persons travelling on government or diplomatic business, would I think, apply with even greater force to India. It looks to me as if Government of India will insist on the introduction of diplomatic passports, whatever the United Kingdom practice may be, and Dunbar's letter ought to serve as a salutory reminder of the troubles ahead if such a course is adopted. I don't think we can do better than copy Dunbar's letter to Fry and if you agree I shall see that this is done.FILE COPY. 27 n l 7|‘’ FOREIGN OFFICE. 3.W. 1. r' (T 22263/4/378). Dear Owain Jones, #. 9 8400 NDEXEQ. Ext. 7&gt;679/L6 of the 13th of the issue of diplomatic passports, We are still opposed in principle to the introduction of such passports. The main reason for our attitude, and in our view the decisive reason, is the difficulty of framing and sticking to the categories of people entitled to diplomatic passports. It would be practically impossible to confine them to persons genuinely travelling on diplomatic or government business, and we are quite certain that the introduction of diplomatic passports would lead to endless trouble with people who, though not falling within the category of persons entitled to diplomatic passports, would expect to receive exceptional treatment., Another reason for not issuing diplomatic passports is ourctesire to retain unimpaired the advantage of being able to tell foreign government officials that we have only one class of passport for all British subjects. This argument has frequently helped us to deal effectively with foreigners (official or non-official) who have sought to claim, on the mere possession of a diplomatic passport, the privilege of a diplomatic visa. We know from ex erience that many W.R. Owain Jones, Esq., India Office. /foreignfb reign i nn g^ ve diplomatic passports to people who do not qualify for diplomatic visas according to our rules' and we have been able to insist on our view that ii is the status of the traveller that counts, not the document he carries. I ought perhaps to add that if the United Kingdom Government decided to introduce diplomatic passports it is unlikely that they could be granted as freely as some passages in Mr. Fry's letter appear to imply. Private travellers would ordinarily not qualify at all, whatever their position. If is not a fact that United Kingdom diplomatic visas are granted automatically on diplomatic passports however true this may be of foreign diplomatic visas, and I have some doubt whether a diplomatic passport would have any effect whatever, unless it were unfavourable, on a British Customs Officer. It is indeed One of our objections to diplomatic passports that the abuse of them by foreign Governments has rendered this type of document suspect. I am sorry that I cannot say whether Australia uses diplomatic passports, but if they do we have not come across one yet. Yours sincerely _E. W.

J Ct'Qjt* Kill CJ? ^ il 1^ I oiclose a letter|from Piy of the External Affairs Department of the Gov mment of India asking for our advic^f and^in particular, the views of the Foreign Office on the question of the issue by the Government of India of diplomatic passports. It seems possible that^whatever the United Kingdom practice may be, the Government of India will sooner or later wish to issue diplomatic passports for themselves, jI should the it fore- be grateful if you would be good enough to let me have your comments on the points raised by Fry and suggest the lines along which/© A good many delegates to International Conferences (to say nothing of other distinguished persons proposing to travel abroad) ask us to supply them with diplomatic pass ports; such requests have of course been made before from time to time, notably by Indian Princes, but are now increas ing considerably in volume. The answer we invariably return is based on Forei^xi 2 . Office letter No.P.4251/13 of the 5th July 1930, a copy of which was sent to the then Foreign and Political Department with Patrick 1 s letter No. 2638 G/13 of the 17th July 1930; namely, that there is no such thing in British practice as a diplomatic passport. We then issue a normal passport, to w ich we ask foreign authorities concerned to affix a di c a, and supply the intending traveller of status with wjhat we call a ’'Foreign Secretary’s letter”, a document •^tting out who the holder is and asking all British uthorities to extend to him such facilities and courtesies as may be possible.The External Affairs Department, (© This document(which is of some modest antiquity, and no recent innovation) can on occasion be of much value, as I fancy that that part of the General Assembly delegation recently stranded first in Cairo and then in Rome has proved; circumstances may however render it impossible to continue much longer to issue such a document. 2. However that may be, the pressure of demand in this country for diplomatic passports is not likely to decrease. On the contrary, it seems possible that whatever the United Kingdom practice may be the Government of India will sooner or later wish to issue diplomatic passports for themselves, and we should like to be in a position to offer the best advice we can on the subject when it is raised. Could you therefore kindly let me know the pros and cons, as His Majesty T s Government see them, of iss^ ing diplomatic passports? We realise thrt, so far as travel in countries outside the Commonwealth is concerned, it is not so much the type of passport that a traveller holds as the type of visa that appears on it that matters, and that a diplomatic passport will not necessarily ensure that its holderExternal Affairs Department, -3- The 19 holder is given a diplomatic visa. On the other hand, v;e ga+her that the United Kingdom is nor the only major country that does not issue diplomatic passports, and that diplomatic visas are in fact ordinarily granted forth with to holders of diplomatic passports. Moreover, a diplomatic passport would surely be valuable both in the holder's own country and in other Commonwealth countries: a distinctive passport might, for example, be calculated to produce more effect on the Customs than an ordinary passport bearing no matter what description of its holder's status. Incidentally, we have the impression that Australia issues diplomatic passports. We should be most grateful for advice in this matter. o K.

My dear Fry, British Leg 1st July y i a^feioft, -Kabul* f 43 ^F X i' 0 *'% 66 1 Q O i Monsieur Karabuda, the Counsellor of, the Turkish Embassy in Kabul, came to see me the other day and in the course of our conversation reminded me - all in the most friendly way - of the fact that last year when he wanted to go to India for a few days we had ceen unable to give him a visa on the spot but had had to secure the prior consent of the Government of India. This was of course in accordance with your telegram no. 333 dated 2nd August 1941, and it was made clear at'the time nf^this inability was a universal one applying to all nation alities. During our conversation I thought it advisable to re.iind Monsieur Karabuda of the universal character of this inability. Tis Embassy, he continued, had informed the Turkish Government as a matter of interest of the fact that they could not get visas from us on the spot and the Turkish Govern ment - without, he assured me, any instigation from here - had taken up the matter with His Lajesty*s Government through their Ambassador in London. As a result the Turkish Embassy had just received a telegram telling them that the Turkish Government had been informed that His Majesty's Government and the Government of inuia agreed that in future the concurrence of the Government of India would not be necessary for a visa to be given to a Turkish diplomatist proceeding to India from Afghanistan. 5* :Ve have received telegram no. 3004 dated 10th May 1943 from the Foreign Office but ti is does not itself go so far as what Monsieur harabuda oelieves to have been agreed as stated above, even before its curtailment in some degree by circular telegram no. 164 dated 16th June 1943 from the Foreign Office. Under our present instructions therefore it seems that next time a Turkish diplomatist wishes to go away temporarily from Kabul on a visit to India for shopping and recreation we will still have to obtain tne concurrence of the Government of India before giving a visa. mI 1 ’i le ab ° ve conclusion is based on the assumption that travelling to and from their posts' 1 in (1) of Foreign Office telegram no. 30Q4 dated 10th May 1943 carries the sense normally attacned to these words and that we are not to regard a casual ' visit by monsieur Karabuda or his colleagues to India from Kabul as ''travelling from their posts' in Kabul. As, however, the u-overnment of India must have been in consultation with I is Majesty's Government over these orders, I shall be grateful if you will kindly confirm that the above assumption is correct. 5* .

WITH reference to The Marquess Gurzon’s circular despatch T 5106/4390/350 of the 30th May, 1921, respecting the grant of diplo matic visas by His Majesty’s Embassies and Legations, I have to request that the general instructions on this subject contained in the circular despatch of the 31st July, 1919, shall now be cancelled and replaced by the following more detailed instructions. 2. Diplomatic visas should only be granted to persons falling within the following categories:-— , ... “ (1.) All members of reigning houses and Presidential families and members of ex-reigning houses who are pcrsonce grated'to His Majesty’s Government. (Members of ex-Presidential families are private persons, and should be treated as such unless special considerations make such a course undesirable.) “(2.) Members ,of the Diplomatic Service of foreign States proceeding to or returning from their posts, and foreign Consular officers de carriere if proceeding to posts in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the British Empire. “ (3-) Cabinet Ministers and salaried officials of foreign Govern ments on official missions. “ (4.) Official representatives on the League of Nations of States who are members of the League and members of the Secretariat- General of the League when travelling in their official capacity, in accordance with the terms of article 7 of the Covenant of the League. “ (5.) Diplomatic visas may be granted to regular foreign diplomatic couriers, that is, either to those whose names appear on an official list furnished by the Government concerned or who hold passports which leave their status in no doubt. Occasional messengers may also be accorded diplomatic visas at the discretion of His Majesty’s representatives. (030/1928) [P.T.O. 4597 18158—8% c ; ; \ . U “ (C.) The wives and families of persons included in cate gories (2), (3) and (4), if travelling with their husbands or proceeding to or from the posts at which the latter are stationed. “(7.) The servants of diplomats should also receive diplomatic visas when travelling with their employers; when they are travelling alone on their way to or from posts at which they have been employed they should receive ordinary visas gratis.” 3. Cases are bound to arise where, although an applicant does not fall within the above seven categories, it would none the less be undesirable for special reasons to refuse a diplomatic visa. In these circumstances the application may be granted if specially authorised by the Secretary of State or the head of the diplomatic mission in the country concerned. 4. Diplomatic visas are given free of charge, and, except in the case of regular couriers, should be available for the single journey only. 5. In cases where it is considered undesirable to accede to an application for a diplomatic visa, but desirable, on grounds of inter national courtesy, to facilitate a journey, a gratis visa may be granted after consultation with the Passport Control Ofiicer.
