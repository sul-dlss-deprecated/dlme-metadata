H.H the Sultan who has just left Muscat in his yacht informed ;i\e that he was going for a fortnight to /Chassub the furthest poirv in his dominions within the Persian Gulf. The Captain of the JTur el Bahr has however been asking the ITavy as to Mne Abu Tha'oi . It was accordingly evident th i.t It. t was going to that place a fact which was confirmed by th&lt; retinae and money he wa.f-« taking w’i th him. Ae I was uncertain what our line of policy was with regard to h: his visits to ot her Chiefs and x i could see no reason why he shoul conceal his visit from me I sent the Dragoman to ask him if he was going to Abu f ~habi. as I &gt; ould like to let the Pesident know. He replied that he had had zhe idea earlier but had given it up anc was now not evev proc edin r ; to thaesao on account of the weather. It would then appear that he had given up the trip to Abu Thabi because I had. asked him concerning it. As he had not informed me of his intention I presume that he had some reason for not wanting me to know.

'1® IhS-C V&gt;'- I- i-j British Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, 22nd January 1917, P1 From Major A,P.Trevor, C.I.E., . • Deputy Political Resident,Persian Gulf. To Major L.B.H.Haworth,I.A., Political Agent , Muscat, Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter N 0 . 6 -C. dated 16th January 1917 incfuiring what Hijack our policy in reference to the relations of His Highness the Sultan with the Chiefs of the Trucial coast and other Arab Chiefs. 2. In reply I beg to say that the Chiefs of the Trucial Coast look up to the Sultan of Muscat as the principal Arab Ruler of the Gulf and sometimes refer matters to him, send presents to him and sometimes visit him. We however consider the Chiefs of the Trucial Coast under British protection, and do not admit that the Sultan has any kind of suzerainty or over- lordship over them, however shadowy. The foreign relations of these Shaikhs are by Treaty conducted by us. In the circumstances while we could not object to| friend ly visit by the Sultan to the Chiefs of the Trucial Coast at rare intervals, I think we should do our best in a quiet way to discourage very intimate relations if there are any signs of any such relations springing up. It is oossible because he realizes this that H.H. put off his visit to Abu Dhabi when he heard you were enquiring about it. I may mention that the Extra Assistant Resident here thinks that Said Taimur's father the late Sultan visited the Trucial Coast some 7 or 8 years ago, but so far I have not been able to find any record of it. 3. The remarks made above regarding respect for the Sultan in✓ \ (in a 1 0 sb degree), foreign relations etc/,, apply to the Shaikh of Bahrain, e id I think the same attitude should be adopted in regard to the Sultan’s relations with him*. 4. The position as regards Bin Saud,the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Shaikh of Qatar is somewhat different. With the Shaikh of Kuwait our relations are analogous to those existing with Bahrain only our protection has hitherto not been so marked, not having been recognized by other powers before the war. In future, no doubt, we shall exercise more regular protection. As regards Bin Saud and the Shaikh of Qatar, treaties have # recently been made with these Rulers, and we shall in the future no doubt get control of their foreign relations. It is however unlikely that the Sultan will desire to start intimate relations with the Shaikhs; if you hear of his attempt ing to do so, I think it would be as well to intimate as tact fully - as possible that we expect him to consult us before making any arrangement as those Rulers come within the sphere of the Military operations. *• I sending a copy of your letter and of my reply to the Political Resident and Chief Political Officer to ascertain if he concurs with the policy outlined above.
