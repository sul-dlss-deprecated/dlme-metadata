The Bahrain Petroleum Company enjoy the right to construct, erect and operate telephone, telegraphs and radio provided radio equipment is not used to transmit messages beyond the limit of their concession vide Article 4(b) of the Deed of Further Modification dated the 29th December, 1934.

I suggest the omission of Article 5. .The Bahrain Government levy no port dues at present as they provide no facilities but we may in due course have to ask them to levy dues to cover the expenses of the quarantine administration and of lighting and buoying and I see no good reason why the Cable and Vs/ireless Company's vessels should be exempt from them. Nor do I see any reason why they should be exempt from the payment of dues for the use of the Bahrain Petroleum Company's wharf at Sitra should that Company eventually decide to levy them. r 4 .^- , Article 6 regarding registration expenses should, I think, be omitted.

Dear Mr . ^D^r^ld Idson, As requested in your letter Sxt«8437/46 of the 19th instant, I send you herewith five copies of a further statement shewing the details of the Estimated Annual Charges in connection with the proposed Bahrain Telephone Scheme, which I think will be of use to Colonel Hay. I also enclose 4 copies of our earlier memorandum and should be grateful if you would distribute them to interested Departments as you suggest.Call Fees. Per 3 minute call. Between Manama and Muharrak w ff Awali ,f Muharrak ” Awali annas »t tt In August 1945 Cable and Wireless were advised that the Bahrain Government accepted the above scheme, subject to the call fees being adjusted later. Accordingly, the Company commenced making arrangements to implement the above scheme. From the outset, however, difficulties were experienced in obtaining the necessary site for the projected telephone exchange building in Manama and no assistance was offered by the local Government. Eventually a site was purchased at a figure greatly in excess of that originally estimated. The tender for the telephone apparatus also exceeded the figure first proposed. Building costs were also very high. The cost of the scheme today would be approximately 40 $ more than that prepared in 1945 upon which the rentals and call fees, quoted above, were based. Consequently, the Company is faced with a loss of at least £ 10,000 on the first five year f s working, if the original proposals are carried out, and provided building and other costs are not increased on the estimates obtained in July 1946. In July 1946 the Company^ Special Telephone Technical Adviser arrived in Bahrain to investigate the whole position. His report was briefly to the effect that in view of the costs involved the installation of an Automatic System was too ambitious and was unwarranted by local demand, and that a magneto or central battery system efficiently maintained and operated was ample to meet local requirements for many years. On the 7th November 1946. a meeting took place at Electra House with Colonel Hay, the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, from which it transpired that great importance was attached by the Sheikh and the British Comnunity to the installation of the automatic system. The proposed rentals were also considered to be too high. Colonel Hay appreciated the difficulties regarding building costs and stated that he hoped the Sheikh might be persuaded to use his influence with his subjects to reduce these. He also stated that it mignt be possible to consider a subsidy to cover the initial annual loss of installing and operating an automatic telephone system in Bahrain for a number of years. A statement is attached showing the estimated Capital Cost and annual loss involved in providing an automatic telephone system in Bahrain on the basis of the original charges for rentals and call fees mentioned above. 16th December, 1946Affix fummed tab hareAffix gummed tab here 51-4076a Telephone Temple Bar 1222 RLE ^ Telegrams Empiregram Estrand Lon CABLE AND WIRELESS LTD ELECTRA HOUSE VICTORIA EMBANKMENT LONDON WC2 if' don TM/P 6 / 7 . ^ 0 Reply to the Chairman l '' quoting reference and date ^ ^ igth :Decs!nber,1946 £ T 5 i / ?&lt;?

When the Shaikh of Bahrain came to see me / on my return from the United Kingdom I mentioned to him my discussions with Cable &amp; Wireless about the proposed automatic telephone system for Bahrain. He at once showed great interest in the subject and said that Cable &amp; Wireless had now been havering over the matter for two years and that he had no doubt that if he asked the Bahrain Petroleum Company to instal the telephone system for him they would be ready to do so at once. He also used as his own an argument which I had employed in a conversation I had with him about two months ago to the effect that as travellers from all over the world were now visiting Bahrain while in transit by air it was necessary to take urgent steps to improve the amenities of Manama and Muharraq in order that they might take away with them a good impression of the Sheikhdom. Incidentally it of course makes it more difficult for us to press him and Belgrave to spend money on such amenities if such slow progress is made with improvements for which they themselves are already anxious. The present telephone system is extremely bad and I well remember what difficulty I had in trying to make contact with the Political Agent and Belgrave when I passed through Bahrain twice in transit last year. 3. I left a note of my conversations with Cable &amp; Wireless in which I said that they had promised to let us have a detailed statement of the expenditure involved in installing the system so that we might see here whether it is possible to suggest reductions or7^ f You wrote to i^e on the 4th Ijyember about this roatter sad I have no?, hod on opporUjilty of cfioousolng It with Sinclair^ Telaocdnunl cattone Attaoho, Middle Enet, who is over here for a short tir^e. The position le unaettifhotarjr nnd I think it Is doing to British prestige in thnt part of the w&gt;rld. ! Irst of all I would remark that there seems to be ssrae doubt about the nature of the Company’s alternative proposal, '/lU as in telegram : ,o« 11 76 the olltleal Hasid nt talks about a marge to ayaterc nth ere aTTlnc lair seoma to have got the impreaalown that the proposal was for a Manual ^atem which may, of course, main an up-to-dato nvmurl sysiesu I would aay etraigtit away that any proposal for the installation at , Bahrein of a magneto exchange should ba condercned* It should be remembered that these smaller kiddle Instern btntea are very anxious, for prestige reasons, to have what they consider to be the moat modem system when they have brought themselves to the pitch of spending money on telephone development, and 1 think it would be poor tactics cm our part to press them, against their will, to tove anything but vhat can reasonably be displayed as up-to-date. If they ere unable or unwilling to permit or ensure remunerative prices and rentals to the ooncea lonalrea, It would be better to retire from the Held than to do the Job on the cheap by installing an obsolete system in which no one could take any pride* Various technical difficult lee have been mentioned, end In particular the presence of surface water, but this is an obstacle which it may be possible to ovcrcone without groat expense, e # g # by using overhead open-wire construction or aerial cables on poles (external work of thie nature is of course rsquiror: whatever type of exchange is used). I underotand that the Company are also faced with exorbitant demnda by land-owners and contractors ot Bahrein in reepect of • land to be acquired and the buildings It would ba necessary to construct* These higher cotta have thrown out their original eeti late for the scheme and it apnears thht they have suggested manual working (whlah is cheaper to install than automatic) in order toavoid a loss on the whole scheme. We understand that Colonel Hay, (the oiltlcal Rcaidejut, ycraien Oulf) saw nanison-lender and other representatives of the company an the ,?tb November, that tho company undertook to sand Colonel Hay, ^through the India Office, a detailed finmicial statement so that it could be seen whether there was any pocalblllty of reducing the cost of land and buildings or of persuading the * ^ Batireiu (Jovenvitenu to pay a saboidy. The level of the rentals Xv to be charged to the subscribers is also n major financial o\ factor in regard to which we are told there is a difference of ■ opinion between the C crap any and the Bahrein Government, t The installation itself is of course not large and the prospects of telephone develorsnent are, I under stand, limited* It may therefore well be that so far as export policy IS'' concerned ooeratlon of the Bahrein telephone system by Cable and irelesa Ltd* le not of great importance* The India Office will no doubt be able to aay how far installation and ■*■ operation/6. Extract from Notes on visit to the Persian ''juLf, October, 1946, from Telecommunications Attache to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 20th October, 1946. Bahrein Automatic Telephone System 1. While the present position regarding the installation of the new automatic telephone system is very unsatisfactory the blame for the delay and uncertainty cannot all be laid at the feet of Cable and Wireless Ltd., and the visit of the Company's Divisional Manager to Bahrein should enable the situation to be cleared up to a very large extent. 2. To summarise, the Company learned, in September 1944, of tenders submitted to the Bahrein Government by three American manufacturers for the installation of a new automatic telephone system. The Company approached the India Office, and said that if necessary, they would be prepared to install and operate such a system in order to keep American influence to a minimum. The approval of the Bahrein Government for the Company to submit a proposal was given in December 1944. The Company sent an engineer to Bahrein in April 1945, who, after an extensive survey, recommended the installation of an automatic system. Considerable difficulty was experienced in the purchase of the necessary land for the exchange buildings, and there was apparently little, if any, co-operation from the Bahrein Government who, the Company claim, were only going against their own interests and forcing up the ultimate telephone rental by allowing the Company to pay inflated commercial prices for land, instead of themselves purchasing or requisitioning the necessary sites and disposing of them to the Company at a reasonable figure. 3. Undue emphasis was also laid by the Bahrein Government on the necessity for keeping rentals on the new system down to the present figures, which seems quite unnecessary and miserly, for if subscribers are prepared to pay the existing rentals for the appalling service which they now get, they would obviously be prepared to accept a reasonable increase to cover an improved service. A small increase was ultimately accepted. 4. A purchasing specification was drawn up on the engineering survey, and after various delays, the Company informed the India Office in February 1946 that the necessary orders had been placed and that delivery was expected within twelve months. While there does not seem to have been any great activity on the part of the Company to get these orders placed, this is perhaps understandable from their point of view at the time, for with the threat of nationalisation hanging over their heads, they did not wish to embark on any scheme involving considerable capital expenditure until their own future position was a little more clear, as that capital would otherwise remain available for distribution to their shareholders on the break-up of the Company as a commercial entity. In any event, the orders are now placed, and there is no information that they have been cancelled in the light of more recent developments. 5. A few months ago, the Company's Technical Advisor on telephones arrived in Bahrein to complete the survey and make the necessary arrangements for the work of installing the new system. On arrival, he found the question of the purchase of land still incomplete, and once again, claims to have received no co-operation from the Bahrein Government, coupled with v/hich the contractors' estimates for the construction of the necessary buildings had risen almost 100^ over the previous figures. He was also informed that B.A.P.C.O. proposed to charge the Company for all calls put through to their Awali exchange, which would make some appreciable difference to the Company's annual revenue. On top of this, the Bahrein Government maintained their attitude that rentals must not be increased any more.6. He also found other technical difficulties, not apparent in the original survey, including the fact that there was surface water in many of the areas where it was proposed to lay underground cables and inspection manholes, entailing the provision of special cables and various expensive alterations to the original project. The State Engineer says he does not understand how this query has arisen, for ^either he nor his Surveyor was in Bahrein at the time to give the Technical Advisor any information about water levels# 7. Paced with higher installation and building charges than originally expected, and a lower annual revenue, and bearing in mind that the Company have to recover their outlay during the 15 or 20 years life of the installation, the Technical Advisor was forced to prepare an alternative scheme. This involves the use of a manually-operated exchange instead of an automatic installation, in order to reduce the initial capital expenditure on the exchange to compensate for the higher installation costs and the lower annual working revenue. Under this scheme, rentals would be the same as the present scale. . The revised project has not yet been forwarded to London, pending receipt of the comments of the Bahrein Government on the proposed substitution of a manual exchange, but the reasons for the change put to the Bahrein Government have led the latter to believe that the Company have abandoned the original proposals for reasons of their own, and feel, somewhat erroneously, that the fault lies entirely with the Company. 8. While a well-operated manual exchange and new overhead routes would, from the technical point of view, give adequate facilities for Bahrein, it is nevertheless felt that it is a retrograde step, which the Bahrein Government should not be advised to accept, until the Company have at least proved that the individual rentals which would have to be charged for the automatic system would be too high; full reason for the increase over the original estimates should be given. The following action would therefore appear to be necessary while the Company’s Divisional Manager is still in Bahrein, although it is also considered desirable that the Technical Advisor should also pay an early visit - a) To check the original survey with the State Engineer to see whether there is in fact surface water in the areas where the cables are to be laid. b) If there is surface water, to estimate how much it will cost to provide alternative routeings or special cables to overocme the difficulty (The Company's Technical Advisor should have this information available). c) To estimate the additional capital cost of the automatic system caused by (b) above and by the increased cost of land, buildings and any other factors. d) To persuade the Bahrein Government that they will be helping themselves by assisting in obtaining suitable land at a reasonable figure# e) To persuade the Bahrein Government that their attitude towards any further increase in the proposed rentals may have to be changed. f) To investigate the allegation that B.A.P.C.O. propose to charge for calls to their Awali exchange, as thei« views must surely have been misinterpreted. g) To assess the increased annual rental (based on a 15 or 20 year /concession)concession) arising from any of the difficulties in (a) to (f) above, and to see whether it can still be kept to a reasonable figure. If the revised rental for an automatic system is unacceptable, then to examine the proposal for installation of a modem manually—operated system. (There is, of course, the danger that if Cable and Wireless Ltd. are not able to install an automatic system in view of the excessive rental involved, then the Oil Companies may subsidise an American manufacturer to carry out the necessary work - this point should be watched). Ship-to-shore Communications - Bahrein 9. This is operated satisfactorily by Cable and Wireless Ltd., although with the increase of post-war shipping in the Gulf, it may shortly be necessary to increase the existing very restricted schedules on the short-wave service. This can be done without difficulty. Civil Aviation Communications - Bahrein 10. The present facilities operated by Cable and Wireless Ltd. in agreement with the Air Ministry (now Ministry of Civil Aviation) are working satisfactorily and are adequate. Broadcasting - Bahrein 11. Although the daily broadcasts were ceased a few months ago. Cable and Wireless Ltd. still have the necessary equipment, and a second transmitter of the type suitable for short-wave broadcasting is now being installed. + + + + + +ft-r/i-d Asst i ) • Lit, Hargis on I discussed the question of an automatic telephone system for Bahrain v/ith ilr. Pender and other representatives of Cable 6z Wireless today. They stated that even with the tariffs whicn they had proposed txiey could not run such a system except at considerable loss to themselves. This was largely due to the exorbitant demands by land-owners and contractors at Bahrain in resx&gt;ect of the land tney wished to acquire and the buildings it would be necessaiy to construct. I suggested that they should send me through the India Office a detailed financial statement and that we would then see whether there was any possibility of reducing the cost of land and buildings or of persuading the Bahrain Oovernment to pay a subsidy. They agreed to do as I suggested. May I kindly be given a copy of this note? (Sgd.) W.R. Hay, 7/11.FILE COPY.

I assume that the causes for complaint mentioned by cir Geoffrey Prior refer to our inability to meet the many demands for connection to the System which, as you say, is solely due to difficulties in supplying and shipping the necessary equipment. I am a.gain emphasising to all concerned the necessity for acting as speedily as possible in order to satisfy all demands at the earliest possible moment. Colonel Bloodworth, who is our Telephone expert, is at the moment on his way to the Persian Gulf to organise the • installation of the Bahrein Telephone System. He is calling at Kuwait and has been fully briefed as to the present situation there. I anticipate his advice and report will go far to ameliorate any criticisms which may still exist. I do not seem to have received any specific complaints of delay on messages between Kuwait and Abadan, although in February of this year there was an interruption to the Persian landlines beyond Bushire which nay have affected tenporarily the handling of traffic with Abadan. However to overcome delays a wireless circuit was worked between these two places to bridge over the interruption. You are aware that the Persians would not permit the operation of a wireless circuit between Abadan and ourselves at Bahrein. Thank/w o ’ Thank you for your offer to examine a concession to regula'^je our position at Kuwait, and also for Bahrein, to which you refer in your letter EXT. 3492/46 of the 23rd instant, I will have the necessary documents drawn up and communicate again with you in a short while, * Yours sincerely, (Sd.) Edward Wilshaw, Chairman, Si.’n&gt;.u. l. In the last paragraph of your letter of 12th March last, you referred to the possibility of your Company negotiating the grant of a concession or the conclusion of an agreement with the Sheikh of Bahrein, Yto have now heard from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that it would be desirable for your Company's position at 7 t~hrein to be secured by a formal concession, but that the present is not a suitable time to initiate negotiations. Sir Geoffrey Prior thinks that it would be better to wait until the automatic telephone system now being installed at Bahrein is nearing completion, and that this delay would not be harmful to your Company’s interests. If, however, you care to send me a draft of the provisions which you would like to see included in the concession agreement we will gladly have this examined in the meantime.

C. 2, 12th March, 1946, '^E.P.Donaldson, Esq,, C.M.G-. * India Office, S.W. 1. Dear Mr. Donaldson, May I refer to your letter of 7th ultimo in connection, inter alia, with the alleged bad working of our telephone service in Kuwait. I have had the Political Agent's complaint investigated and I regret that there should have been cause for His Highness The Shaikh to be dissatisfied with the service furnished to him at his palace at Bay an. The main difficulty regarding the telephone connection with the palace is the landline erected by His Highness which was frequently breaking down. New material is being sent to Kuwait to erect a new landline,/and I am informed that His Highness has expressed his gratification to our Manager in Kuwait. Only a small proportion of the complaints is attributable to causes under our control. Many arise frcm lack of understand ing on the part of subscribers, and others are due to frequent contacts between overhead lines caused by children throwing weighted strings over the wires, which the local authorities have made no sustained efforts to prevent. As far as we are responsible for some of the complaints, these may be attributable to shortness of staff which is difficult to overcome through lack of acconmodation at Kuwait. The telephone inspector was absent from ^Kuwait owing to furlough /and11 2 . and subsequently to sickness and during his absence it was not possible to obtain replacement. The inspector returned to Kuwait last December, further assistance has been sent, and a European engineer is en route for the purpose of overhauling the wireless installation and looking into the present condition of the telephone plant. Owing to the impossibility of sending materials from this country for maintenance and extension of the existing telephone* installation, attempts have been made several times to secure them from India, without success and I am informed that it is more difficult to obtain permission to export them now than during the war. Spares have, however, been obtained in London and are now on the way to Kuwait. Regarding the question of additional equipment to meet the applications for telephone connections, I would point out that in October 1943 we asked the India Office to assist us in obtaining priority for an additional 100 line equipment, and in May, 1944 your Office advised us that only 10 additional lines were necessary. As we wore unable to ms.ke this addition without making the switchboard non-standard, we asked you to agree to a 50 line extension. You agreed to this in July, 1944 and we placed the order for the 50 line extension which is now packed and ready for shipment. It is evident from the information sent me in 1943 that actually a switchboard for 100 additional lines is required, and this is now corroborated in the Kuwait Political Agent's letter of 16th December last. I am, therefore, putting a further 50 line automatic telephone switchboard on order for Kuwait straight away. I am much obliged to you for raising the question of a concession at Kuwait. This matter was taken up with your Offi® in 1941 , and perhaps you may wish to see the letters we exchanged with you commencing with mine of 23rd May, 1941 and ending withyours Ext. 242A/Zf-2 of 8 th August, 1942.

The Conference unanimously recommended:- (i) A fundamental change in the organisation of Commonwealth telecommunications services. (ii) The public ownership of the overseas telecommunications services of all the Commonwealth Governments. (iii) The replacement of the existing Commonwealth Ccanmunications Council by a new Board v/ith wider functions representing all the Governments of the Commonwealth. (iv) Financial contributions by members of the Commonwealth for the maintenance and use of the cable system.His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have accepted those recomnendations so far as they affect this country. Subject to the agreement of Parliament the overseas telecommunications services now operated by Gable and Wireless Ltd. will therefore be transferred to public ownership. Legislation will be introduced in due course. The arrangements and terms for this transfer are under discussion. OiT.P.

GPO SS 280 IMMEDIATE My immediately preceding telegram contains text of statement which will be made in Parliament on November 1st at 3*15 p.m. G.M.T. regarding transfer to public ownership of telecommunications services operated by Cable and Wireless Ltd. 2. Since Cable and Wireless Ltd. or their subsidiaries operate in the country in which you reside, you may wish to communicate statement to them immediately before it is made. This communication should not, however, be made sufficiently in advance for there to be any risk of leakage getting back to this country before public announce ment. You may, however, feel that by drawing attention of Government to v/hich you are accredited to this change you may increase risk of their taking action to the detriment of our holdings or interests in their country by nationalisation or otherwise. If so, you may prefer to await enquiries. On the other hand, you may feel that silence may be interpreted by Government to which you are accredited as a sign of our fear that they may take similar action, or that it may result in their receiving an erroneous impression of our intentions. I therefore leave it to your discretion whether or not to make advance communication.. 3. For your guidance in making communication or answering enquiries the main reasons for this step arej- (a) Desire to substitute public service for profit motive. (b) Present system with responsibilities to private shareholders cannot provide cheap and efficient service which Commonwealth requires (c) Post-war financial prospects are poor having regard to increased costs, competition for airmail, etc. (d) Desire of,Dominions and India to have a greater share in the control of the system on which their own communications depend and to exercise their, sovereign rights. • 4. The new United Kingdom body will be a public utility corporation and not (repeat hot) a Government department, and its &gt; staff will not be civil servants. (To Cairo only) - It would be wise to stress this. (To The Hague only) 5. Cable and Wireless Ltd. do not operate in Holland but in Netherlands East Indies.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your endorsement No. C/386 dated the 21st October, 1944 and to state that as a result of enquiries which I have made it would seem that Mr. H.K. Hutchings the Acting State Engineer m^da enquiries from Mr. Hussain Yateera a local merchant who does business with America with regard to obtaining an automatic telephone exchange for Bahrain. Mr. Hutchings also discussed the question with the Acting Manager of Messrs. Cable and Wireless Limited and enquired about certain technical details of the installation. » 2. I have discussed this matter with Mr. BelgraVe the adviser to the Bahrain Government who tells me that the enquiries were of an exploratory character. The Bahrain Government would naturally prefer to deal with British firms and I anticipate would be quite prepared to allow Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless Limited to install and run an automatic telephone exchange but at the same time they are anxious to obtain information on American methods and machines so that costs and efficiency can be compared. Since Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless Limited have been operating in Bahrain they have not shown that regard for the interests of the general public and that desire to maintain a high standard of Business efficiency which was to be expected from a British concern with a virtual monopoly.

I have discussed the question with Mr. Panfold who is the %nager of the local office of Messrs.

The present telephone system is deplorable and I anticipate that it will cease to function within the next two years.

Perhaps you are aware that the above-mentioned telephone service has been operating satisfactorily for some years and that the Question of its expansion solely depends on tne possibility of this Company securing the necessary additional equipment. We have now received confidential information from Bahrain that the question of installing automatic telephones is under consideration and that a local mercnant has already asked the USA for Quotations which have been referred to the State Engineer. As you already know, this Company operates the wireless and cable services in Bahrain and we should very much regret to see any action taken in the island which would permit further American penetration in connexion with telecommunications, even if only to the extent of American equipment being supplied for the proposed telephone installation, although there is the'obvious danger of an American telephone operating Company obtaining a footing in Bahrain. We are, therefore, prepared, as in the case of Kuwait, to instal and operate'an automatic telephone i please see overservice in Bahrain, upon such terms and conditions as may eventually be agreed uoon, provided that we may obtain your Department 1 s assistance in securing the necessary equipment in this country. We earnestly hope, however, that you will be good enough to prevent American encroachment into • Bahrain where this Company has invested very substantial sums in order to develop cable, wireless telegraph and aeronautical wireless services during the last few years.

In my opinion it would be advisable for the proposals of the Government of Bahrain to be accepted since there is always a definite risk of serious damage to the submarine cable from dragging anchors and other causes. If the Govern ment of Bahrain take over the line entirely they will pay for all replacements which may be necessary. 6. I do not think it advisable that the extension should be made direct from the Wireless Station to the Landing Ground as this will entail much extra expense and a certain amount of inconvenience should anyone other than those at the Wireless Station wish to communicate with the Landing Ground. 7. As requested stronger poles have already been ordered by air mail and the work of Installation will proceed pending the settlement of the maintenance question. I.C.S., Officiating Political Bahrain.

I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. C/711-17/2 of the 26th July, 1934, and in reply to same, would state:- It is considered to be most c^esiraole that the material and equipment necessary for the extension of the existing telephone system to the landing ground at Maharaq is to be the property oi the Bahrain Government immediately upon its installation; and consequently the suggestions in your paragraph 2. Clauses (a) and (b) are not acceptable. 3. In view of the extension being the property of the Bahrain Governmant and being a part of the existing telephone system, it appears proper that the responsibility for its maintenance should be undertaken by the Bahrain- 2 - v fiA (U^ CoverniBBnt. The Bahrain Govermont would maintain its own property. It should be explained that the charge of Rs 150/- prepayable is for Service (that is, the right of obtaining communication upon the whole telephone system) and not for service and maintenance. Therefore I submit that the sugges tion in your paragraph 3, Clause (1) does not arise. 4. In the even of an exchange being estab lished at laharaq, the extension will become part of the public line between Manaaah and Maharaq and will be available for public service. Jince such service may be regarded as of Public Utility, as an act of grace the Bahrain Government is prepared to give priority service on all calls to find from the Landing Ground over this line. 5* Un the understanding that payment for the accepted tender will not be unreasonably delayed, the clause (b) of your paragraph 5 is answered in the affirmative. 6 . I would add that on account of the importance of this arrangement, and of the fact • that the writer is only temporarily acting for the Adviser, who is in London ana likely to be in touch with the Air Ministry, I am sending a copy of this correspondence to him; and I trust that it is admissible in the Adviser to vary the above, should lie think fit.

The Air Ministry is prepared to agree to the installation of stronger poles at an additional cost of Rs.440. With regard to maintenance we consider that Rs.150 per annum is a fair charge, but we are rather surprised by the suggestion that the material should become the property of the local government. I am moreover, not quite certain whether that condition is to apply immediately or only in the event of the aerodrome being abandoned and the line no longer required by us. If it is intended that application should be immediate!^ we could only agree on the distinct under stand in d; that the line is used solely for Air Ministry purposes. 3. We should be grateful if you would offer the following alternatives to the Bahrein Government : (a) The Air Ministry to pay Rs.150 per annum, the line being taken over at a valuation when no longer needed by us. (b) The line to be handed over (when no longer required) gratis, in exchange for free maintenance. (I might add that the chances of the aerodrome ever being abandoned are remote.) /In J.G.Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.* 4.

For extra sum not exceeding Rs.440/- spent now it will be possible to erect posts strong enough to carry a power line if eventually required. 3. It this is not done, cost of installing new poles for power line, if eventually required, will be:- ‘ Poles.. Rs.l,82u/- Erection etcetera. 500/- Rs.2,320/- 4. If it is desired that the stronger poles should be erected at once, perhaps Secretary of State for India could be asked to2 . then he placed by telegram. If the stronger poles are not required the one word f WEAK 1 would enable me to instruct the State Engineer to order poles for the telephone only. 5. otate Engineer says that, provided the Suppliers keep to delivery dates, it should be possible to put the line into operation in October 1934. 6 . Bahrain Government are prepared to guarantee maintenance and service, so long as the line to the Landing Ground is required, provided (aj that an annual rental of us.150/- is paid and (b; that the material becomes the property of the Bahrain Government. This is, I think, the most economical arrangement. The Bahrain Government would reserve power to introduce an exchange in Muharraq, but in that case the Air Ministry would retain priority of commurication over the line.

Since the above estimate was made it has been found possible to reduce it from Ks.7750 to Hs.7400 owing to favour able quotations having been received for material. 5. r ihe Acting State engineer emphasises that the present estimate of R8.7400 is for a well constructed line. He could still produce a cheaper line by using 'kutcha' material, for example, wooden brackets, but neither he nor I recommend this course, in view of the importance that the line should be thoroughly dependable. 6 .

Dear Reference our conversation to Bahrein is as follows*- The situation with regard Imperial Airways aerodrome is on Muharrak, whilst the I* &amp; I*G« wireless station is at Manamah* There is, we understand, a small exchange in Manamah, the property of the Bahrein Telephone Company. It will be necessary for both the wireless station^ and the aerodrome to be connected to this exchange. I should be grateful if you would obtain from the Political Resident confirmation that there is no land line communication between the two islands at the present time. If this is so, we should like to know:- (1) Whether an overhead line can be erected, or whether a submarine cable is essential. (2) Whether the Bahrein Telephone Company could undertake the installation. If not, who could? Since it has become essential for the two islands to be connected, it would be a pity to limit this connection to the single line required for Imperial Airways 1 purposes. By installing several lines at the same time, telephonic communication would be available between Muharrak and Manamah. /TVV t r C/ If this is done, some arrangement might be reached between the Air Ministry and the local authorities concerning the incidence of the cost of installation. The new wireless station is expected to be in operation by May; consequently, there is not much time to lose. J.G.
