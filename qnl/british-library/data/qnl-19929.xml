To OittRiftM'hU! t The Hon^ole the Politinn.1 __i ii the Persian G-ulf 3 _3ushire. ^ir, I nave ^Iie honour to say that the Jalirain Crovernnieiit have not found it possible to meet current expenditure 'bv J. j revenue despite drastic economies,the figures for the first six months of the Arabic year showing a deficit of Rs.31,625/- on cue oudge i esoi..ates and a deficit of 33.110,420/- upon the figures of the first half year of 1349. lio iurther econom3r appears possible in the adminis tration^ and building and similar non-productive expenditure lias been reduced to a minimum. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad lias reviewed the situation and decided upon two economies and two sources of additional revenue. Three of these will require the concurrence of the Government of India,the fourth being a matter the Shaikh is competent to decide without further reference. 3. The two measures of economy are the reduction 'of the a ppointment of Captain Parke and the substitution of local men for the fifty remainipg Indiaii Police. Captain Parke costs the Jtate some ?is. 14,000/- per annum and local men couio. oe secured ior Rs.25/- per mensem- as compared with the ..-. l . now paid to t..e mdian Police thereby resulting in an annual saving oi r:s.D,vj-j/- apart from a considerable sum now expended on assa es and leave oav ^ JL «/ -i-. j.ne u jo additional sources of revenue are increased customs' dues on luxuries and the levy of aakat mcn^thl'date gardens.•*r 2. gardens. If the Customs' dues upon the former were raised from % to an approximate additional revenue of Rs.3,000/- may 'be expected and a larger import would not he likely to increase the figure. The yield of the zakat has not yet been calculated and it vail he very difficult to form an escinate^ ior a Revenue Department^ as the term is understood in India,does not exist in Bahrain. 5. Another economy that was considered was a cut in salaries over a certain amount ; hut,since a 5^ cut would only produce a saving of some Is.500/- a month this is not heihg put into force at the moment, though it will he necessary later if conditions do not improve. 6. I consider f at the proposals are practical and I recommend their adoption. Gap tain Parke has little to do save ki the six : iQ-.ths in eviry tl-.ird year that he acts for lx ..ielgrave,and he does not seem ahle to give Lr. Jelgrave as much assistance as one night have expected during the remainder of the time. Eis contract expires axter t .e conclusion of his leave in Jeptemher this year and il is proposed that his contract should simply not he renewed, his administration of the 2:11 an Police h..3 not - ^ ressed me aid x consider .al the Jtj,te can do very well without his services until Llr.Belgrave goes on leave in 1 '34. _&gt; that time the recreation or retention of the post of Assistamt Adviser could he reconsidered and the answer would probably be found in the state of the pearl market, which is the real ruler of Bahrain. I heartily recommend the early disbandment of the I ndian Poli ce whose contracts expire during the summer of this year. The caii ate does not suit them or their wives, several of whom have died,and their duties,wkicli consist of u ceaseaess ana we dm cms tour of guard duties, do little rc - ^ their interest. ,They are growing steadily slacker tt-io. ai e by no means a credit to the Indian' Army in which al] - ts j at one time or another,received their training. The datiaer : &lt;ZJ fromfrom the Dowasir,^ consideration wliich leud to thsir feru ption,no longer exists,and local nien,v/Iio are nov/ available in sufficient numbers owing to the local depression.could 'be trained witkout difficulty to oarr^ out their duties. These men would be simpler in every way to deal with and would have the inestimable advantage of speaking ^rabic,the ignorance of vMch has been a great drawback to the Punjabis. o. as regards cue increase in Gustor.is dues,j. feel that t q vi;.:e licis come vz-ien tne Jta -e,s.bject to the advice 01 -ne x'oj ..:.fcical Resident,should be allowed to fix such rates as it pleased. At a time when the Government of India,and for that matter, almost everp country in the world,are •doubling and trebling duties that are already high,I feel that it is inequitable to bind a State like Bahrain,that depends on its customs for nine-tenths of its revenue,to a • live per cent duty. The merchant community are extremely vocal in Bahrain and would not hesitate to express them selves ireely if the duties were greatly increased,and this wholesome check,coupled with the advice of the Political resident should ensure that this new privilege was not abused, nevertheless,when returning prosperity again increased the Cusuoms aues to the high figures of past years it would be necessary to see that the Ruling family,who already receive -7,„ oi the current revenue,did not appropriate the lion's snare of'the enhanced taxation. ~• - - e zaxat will infallibly be passed on by the owners of date gardens to their unfortunate tenantry,who already live near tne starvation line^but zakat is the only tax ■which is really lawful in the eyes of the strict Lluslim and a very high rate is collected by Bin 3a T ud in the ^atif and 'Of; j - uases. iiis excellency proposes at . resent to levy ■ asniir T ,i.e.,a tenth of the produce,and though this may be difficult to collect, will be infinitely preferable to a fixed rate expressed in rupees which bears hardly when dates fetch a iow price as tnay do at the moment. Since Eis Excellency/ ©■ V 4. is convinced of the usefulness of this tax end since no fom of land tax exists I suggest that you should inform him that the proposal may 'be acted 'upon. 10. One point requires mention. Ho immediate econoiay will result from the reduction of Gap tain Parke's post or the substitution of local men for Indians since the former will receive full pay till September and there vail he a time when 'both local men and Indians will have to he paid since the recruits will take time to train. The ultimate economy,however,is ohvious. I request,therefore,that these two proposals and the request for permission to levy enhanced customs dues be referred to the G-overnment of India,with your approval,for an early decision. The levy of zakat requires no reference,but His _ :cellency will probably expect a word from you before putting it into ■a. d ^ o jl o n force.

He goes on leave this spring In this connection please see correspondence ending with Foreign &amp; Political Department letter No F.164-E/29 of 19th January 1931.

In view of the necessity for econosy, however, this met be faceo. ^be cifficulty will arise two years hence when «r. Belgrave goes on leave. It nas been customry in the past for Captain Parke to act for hi® and it is essential to nave soaneone In Bahrain who can perform the duties of the Adviser during Wr. Belgravt 's absence. In any caee, however, I think the post of Coasiandant of Police may be left vacant for a year anc a aalf ana the question of appoint- -Ing some other officer to it can oe reconsiderea in the autumn of 1935. 5 A e aentionec. in aiy telegra Ko. T-«il, oated 2lEt January 1932, the Bahrain Government have alreaoy . A inforsea Captain Parke that it is not their intention to extend his contract. It was explainea to me that they had cone tbis, ar after the queition nac been uiscui-sed&lt;© /' 4 elf cufcsea with Phalkh Haroaa, they tuought It better to let Captain Parke know without delay, a® the amtter woolti certainly have got round to hi® from private eourceE. ?• Jfenraln police force at preeent coneiete of 46 Indian©, 67 Arahs anc 121 nature. the latter are local asen who are unarmec anc asereiy do watch and ward cutlee in the bazaar. The reguiai police Koat would he termed in India an aimed reserve. The Indians are uncoufctedly costly elnce a eepoy draw# jL 35/. pay, plus ratlone, which formerly cost is. lb/- but now cost about 3s. 10/-, plus uniform and pai-eager to taelr hoffles every two years. The Arabs draw is. 25/- plus rati one and uniforms while the natmrs get anc no extras. The object of hairing Indians in the police force was to preserve the peace a.aong the heterogeneoue elements wnich cosaprlee the population of these Islands in the event of riote. The number of Inc.ians, now- -ever, has been gracuelly reduced to 4© and tne Araofe increased to 57, and I am inforaitd that the latter axe now proving satisfactory ant* it Is belleveci that thoy coulc be relied upon In an eiuergency. Howevei, the vaiious eleseents of the Bahrain community have for some years now llveo together In peace ana mi. amity and the canger of intercoaaminai rioting has certainly diminished though it has probably not entirely disappearec. The risk therefore of aavlng a force composed entirely of Arabs is not a great one anc the financial situation justifies, or rather necessitates, running a slight risk. As the Political Agent polnU out, the substitution of Arabs for the remiining Indians would effect a saving of about is. 6,000/- in addition to the cost of par eager and leave pay.• . i I |# 5 (V S. ITnter Article 4 of the Bahrain Treaty of 1861 the State is pi eciiicea froa increafeln^ ite cviBtoae uutiee above At pointed out by the Political Agent, euch a restriction is hardly in keeping with uotern views in euch ®atter« anc I support hit proposal that the Mate ehoule he freed from thie re»triction ana be granted i tariil autonomy. M Captain Prior point® out, tne risk of abuBe ©I thiv concession is islight nince the aier- -cantile co'raBunity wielo® auch influence ana I think we could ensure that any advice which we tenuerec regaroing the tariff woulc be accepted. It ifc the intention of the State only to raise the uuty on eucn article® cilkt, perf wm®, asotor care, etc. ana to refrain iro® aoditiorml taxes on the necesaariee of life. 9, As regardt the aavlfeability of imposing ♦aakst* I have not at present arrived at a definite conclueion. in principle the tax is legitiaaate ana a recognised levy in iiuhsasiedan countties. whether, when the details are worked out, it will be found to be aovieable to i«poee it in Bahrain, where special corasiticns. prevail, ft I as] not yet certain, ana ehoula therefore like to reserve ay opinion regarding the iapoeition of sakat. until the matter hat been gone into in greater cetail. 10, The great difficulty in balancing the Bahrain budget ia the question ol aStka* tne allowances drawn by the ruling fasiily. Till recently these allowances amounted to 50f oi the total revenues of the f taie, najaely b lakht out oi a revenue of 10 lakhK. A cut of 10% has already been effected in the faajily allowances with the full concurrence of Shaikh Haaad. This has effected a saving of ks. b0,000/- but even so, owing to now the fall in revenue, the family allowances aasount^/to b7^ of the total income of the State. A furtner cut is not fear.ible at present but it aay be poesible to effect soma aa&amp;($&gt; some reauctlon on t&amp;e otaise oi of tbe present noldere. A cut in tne pay of all Government offlcialt aoi a furtner cut in the Ai Khalifa allowances may be iounci necessary if tbe eituation coctinuer to deteriorate. 11. It ie aoticipateo that tnese proposal® in a full year would produce about is. 43,000, mae up at follows ; Temporary aoolit Ion of the poet of Coswancant of Police. 14,000. Substitution of Araos for Inaians 6,000. Increase of cmtm®oue® 8,000. Zakat, if imposeu, about 15,000. fOtAi 45,000. Tnie will not enable tbe rtate to balance its buoget anc. it will be neceeeery for taem to draw on tneir reserve, which was created to enable theaj to meet euch a crisis as the present. Hairing regard to the present financial difficultles of all classee of the conranity Increased taxation woulo not at the present juncture bring in much, and woulo be greatly resentea so I oj^, as substantial reserves were known to exist.

You will see that there has been a great drop in his private income and this is due to the fact that date gardens are producing little in the way of rent aiui at the moment ; and the receipts from bazaar properties have also diminished. If he continues to give away valuable bazaar properties to his son,Dai;j jthe receipts from bazaar pro perty will naturally diminish still further. The remark regarding excess in Givil List may be explained as follows: Last year Shaikh Hamad was told that if he could reduce the Givil List below he could keep the savings himself. One or two A1 Khalifa died off and he either took the whole of the deceaseds T allowance him self or a portion of it and this gave him an increase of Hs.5,500/- last year. Ofcourse,now he cannot do this as the A1 Khalifa are getting well over 50^ of the gross revenue. So far he has done nothing in the way of economy and gi^es his domestics Id presents on the usual scale. He will shortly find himself in grave financial difficulties. When I get the figures for this months revenue and expenditure of the Bahrain Government I will send them on to you. - The Hon'ble Lt Col.H.Y.Bisooe.I.A., Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf. ,Bushire.19/176.

I have Just got a tele grant in about the Xarif f, but as it refers to some telegram which i shall pro cab ly reeei.e by air mail shortly, i do not quite know what they have sanctioned. I fancy,however, they have tied our hands pretty effectively as the Government of India were not willing to agree to the tariff autono-oy which I recommended. Personally it is a poor game to keep these petty little States in financial bondage, and I propose to return to the cnarge shortly. loa will have heard that I passed through Bahrain on my «ay to Shargah, and 1 discussed the question of finances with Jelgrave and asked him whether / if given a free hand in tariff matters, he could not produce a balanced budget. H© said he thought he could, and % of course if Shaikh Isa departs to another world it will help things considerably. i elgrave tells me that the hi Khalifa are already discussing the question of dividing his allowance', aasd' I think when he does g© we should strike at once and tell Shaikh Hamad that in view of the critical financial ... ipt.G.G,Prior, Bahrain,financial position there ean be no question of firing this allowance to the Al Khalifa, I think for the moment the beat thing to do is to take «fhateTer they may have giren us in the way of tariff and then if, as 1 assume will be the ease, it would be inadequate to balance the budget / a8k for a further raeasure of tariff autonomy, I am very glad they have agreed to give Holmes an extension, I am sorry that the exam, ooes not seem to have gone very well* but I hope you have got a Second Glass.

CjSi The Agency, Bahrain, •No. 1 y 'f From The Political Agent, BAHRAI i93 To The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to your letter No:188-S dated the 30th March 1932 and to say that in the telegram of the G-overntaeat of India (No:715) of which a copy has been sent to me,there is no mention of an all round increase of in the since it now stands at 5^,an impossible figure which has never 'been suggested or even considered 'by myself or the G-overnment of Bahrain. 2. Nor is the telegram of the Grovermnent of India clear for they say 'we agree that duty on luxury articles mentioned may be raised from S/o to 10^ T . Later they say 'instructed the Political Agent to advise them to make similar all round increase in tariff rates'. This can only mean that the whole tariff should be at a flat rate of 10fo.This has never been asked for and is not desired by the Bahrain Government. So far as I am aware they have never applied for any increase other than the enhancement of the duty on luxuries by 2i^ bringing it up from 5'^ to\ to 7ifo,I cannot understand why the amount of has been introduced. 3. To revert to your above quoted letter. I assume that the words ' all round increase of 7^ ' is an error since it would cripple the trade of Bahrain and lead to a general exodus of its innabitants. It occurs to me that perhaps an 'all round increase of Zkfo bringing the tariff rate up to 7i$' is meant,and I give my views on this in case that is what is required,and also an f\ Sir, tariff rate. Such a rise would bring the total duty to 12-1^2. estimate of its yield. I believe that ; small though the addition is,it would prove a very heavy 'burden,particularly to nakhudas who have to provision large numbers^ of boats. Most of these men are having the greatest difficulty in fitting out boats this yBar,and this additional impost might well prove the last straw for many. The great majority of the inhabitants of Bahrain are desperately poor,and any increase in the price of necessities of life would bring them still near er the starvation line. The customs dues last year brought in R s .5,09,000 7 so an all round eiihancement from 5 to 7i^ would, in theory ; bring in another 2% lakhs. I feel certain,however, that the increase would lead to diminished consumption,and also probably to diving boats obtaining their supplies at a cheaper port,and the actual increased yield might be as low^r as a lakh of rupees. 4. I notice that I was asked not to broach the matter with the State authotities^ut Mr.Belgrave mentioned,among other matters,that the Hon T ble the Political Resident had discussed the question with him,so there seemed no harm in ascertaining his views. He agrees with me that any increase of the general rate would cause great hardship and that it should be left at its present figure of 5/L Luxuries he thinks should be taxed at lOfoand apparently His Excellency Shaikh Hamad would like to have the duty on tobacco raised to 15$. These additions will,he considers,bring in some Hs.50,000/- principally from tobacco,since there is little trade in luxury articles. I concur with these suggestions and request that the Government of India may be asked to agree to thou. It has been found that an increase on luxury articles iiy of only would give a very disappointing return,and so to be scarcely worth institutingpu^ tobacco can easily pay the increase now suggested. 5. I suggest therefore that the general rate remains 5$ as at present,that luxuries should pay 10$ and tobacco 15$. I should mention that the Adviser is anxious to place a customs duty of 15$ on liquor imported under licence for the European community. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad agrees generally with1*0 3 this,but owing to the feeling against recognising it in any way he is at present uncertain whether to proceed with a customs duty or not. I would be glad if the Government of India could be asked to include liquor with tobacco in the enhanced rate of 15^ so that it may be taxed without delay should it be found possible to overcome local scruples. 6. It is requested that an early reply may be given as the matter is urgent. I have the honour to be Sir, Your Most Obedient Servant Political Agent Bahrain.Ul Confidential 2Jo*269»S of 1932» British Residency &amp; Consulate-General Bushire, the 28th April 1932, From • The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political ..esident in the Persian Gulf, To - The Political Agent, Balm i n. April you point out that the levy of aakat is in no way precluded by Treaty obligations and that the State is not under adninistration , so Chat His acellency Shaikh Hamad is presumably in a position to levy this tax without reference to outside authority. You enquire whether your view is correct or not. In aeply I am directed to state that in the ©pinion of the Hon'ble the Political resident your view is correct in theory but not in practice. fio one is more anxious than Colonel Bi scoe to see these Arab Principalities nd Ghaikhdocas conducting their own affairs on indigenous lines with the minimum of interference by the British authorities. He regards Kuwait, in this respect, as the model State in the Persian Gulf, and would like to see other Principalities being as satisfactorily and independently administered. Jnfortunately this postulates a competent and energetic .uler and, as you are aware, these two necessary qualifications are entirely lacking in the present ^uler of Bahrain. He has but little inclination to conduct the affairs of his Principality and lacks both the k In paragraph 2 of your letter Ho.C.56 of 24th energy • • • •energy and ability, and has but recently given a meat lamentable example of his total lack of competence to deal with the smallest difficulties. in these circumatances, the Political Reaident feels that there is really no alternative but to exercise a considerable measure of control over the administra tion, and while he would reduce this interference in the internal affairs of the State to a minimum he considers it essential that any measures which way possibly produce dissatisfaction among any considerable portion of the population siuuld not be introduced without prior consultation with the local British Representative. The imposition of a totally new form of taxation is a measure of this nature, and will clearly have to be introduced with caution and equity. it would, for instance, be lamentable if zakrt was imposed and then as a result of an outcry on the part of any sections of the populace affected Shaikh Hamed withdrew its in fact, if there was a recurrenbe of the incident that recently occurred in connection with the administration of estates. 2. We are .n the last resort responsible for the maintenance of law and order and good government in Bahr in, and. so long as this is the case we can rightfully claim that we should be consulted regarding any measures which may lead to dissatisfaction or disturbance. S'or the above reasons the Kon'ble the Political Resident considers that the question of the imposition of zakat should be the subject of consultation with the British authorities if it is to be introduced.

This slight slip was obvious from the wording of the Governrae t of India's telegram. 2, It is not clear from where you have aerived the impression that the Government of India suggested an increase of 10 per cent, unless a typist's error was made ' &gt; in the copy of their telegram sent to you, x'he Government of India telegram reads ' we agree that duty on luxury articles mentioned may be reised from 5 per cent to 7*- per cent', 3, The suggestion that there shjuld be an increase on the whole tariff has not been pproved by His iCajesty's Government and I am now to forward for your information a copy of telegram Ho,1075 of 27th April received from the Government of India together with a copy of Foreign Office yb letter No. ii, 1353/782/91 of the 24th March, and to request you ...S'» • 2- you kindly to make a communication to the Bahrain Government as directed therein. 4, The Hon* ble the Political resident agrees generally with the views expressed in paragraph 3 of your letter under reply* and considers that, at the present time at any rate, it would be undesirable to raise the duty on necessities of life. It would however interest him to know, supposing the duty on a bag of rice was raised from 5 per cent to 7/ per cent what increase in price would be involved to the retail purchaser. 5, Colonel Biscoe notes that the State now desire to raise the duty on luxury articles to 10 per cent and on tobacco to 15 per cent. It is a pity really that this was not put forward in the first instance as it will now be necessary to make a further reference to the government of India aud to His Majesty's Government *kut the matter will be tc ^en up. 6, I am to request that 1 may be informed for the information of the Hon'ble the olitical Resident on what date the enhanced rate of duty on luxury articles is introduced and what articles are included in this category.

The suggestion that the customs dues should be anticipated by an equivalent demurrage charge is contrary to the spirit of the treaty and if carried out would render it a farce. 2. The 2fo tax at present collected by the Director of Customs on tobacco in addition to the 5% duty was agreed to by Captain Alban in 1927 without reference to the Residency and the amount is paid over to the Manama Municipality. I believe this to be quite irregular, but did not raise the matter of my own motion as the levy had been in force for some time. Apart from any general question of treaty the tax itself is inequitable since by it the tobacco of the whclevislancfc is taxed to provide revenue for a single municipality in - 3.

B, :i f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to state that with reference to the budget for 1351, H. K. Sheikh Hamad approved of the following innovations. 1. A tax on tobacco and its products of 15$ A.v. to be collected by the Customs and to be known ^as tobacco tax, in place of the existing Baladya tobacco tax. 2. A collection of 15JC customs duty on liquor which is now imported free of Customs duty. 3. increase on Customs duty of on the luxury articles on the accompanying list. T now understand that the Government of India is averse to granting tariff autonomy to this State as was desired end proposed, but they suggest a increase throughout on the existing rate on imports. This is not required and is not in the oninion of Shaikh Hamad or myself at all desirable. If these proposals can be adopted, we believe that no other measures will be necessary for additional taxation for which approval of the Government of India need be sought as it is only the rate of Customs duty which is fixed by treaty.in -3- For your information I would state that as a temporary measure, owing to the fact that the increases in the Customs duty as proposed are not sanctioned I propose to make the above charges on tobacco, luxuries and liquor through the Khanchieh as from 1st Maharam 1351, which will produce the same result. The rates of the Khanchieh levy have always been fixed by the direct order of the Ruler, as for instance in the case of the existing 2f tobacco tax.

Sir, I hare the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with Government of India telegram i^o. 1075 of 27th April 1932, regarding the Bahrain Tariff. 2. In that sanction was accorded to a temporary increase of the tariff rate to 7#S on certain luxury articles. In my despatch No.C/7 of the 22nd January 1932, I pointed out that the present increase of customs duty was likely to produce Rs.8,000/- in a full year and other measures that have been sanctioned, namely, the temporary abolition of the post of Comxuandant of Police and the substitution of Arabs for Indians, Rs.20,000/- in a full year. Bo arrangements have jset been made to introduce zakat and in any case it will take time and therefore the total economies effected up to date will not produce more than Rs.28,000, while the deficit during the current year is expected to amount to about Rs.1,20,000/-. It is clear that further measures are necessary. 3. In his letter Mo.C/9 of 17th January 1932, which was forwarded with my despatch referred to above, the Political ....-2- Bolitical Agent while stating that it was the intention of the State to raise the customs duty from 5^ to 7^, asked that the State should be granted tariff autonomy, and this request I supported# It is, however, a somewhat serious modification of our treaty rights, and I did not adrance at the time detailed arguments in support of it and the Government of India did not approve of the proposal. The State, however, have now made a further request, namely, that they should be permitted to enhance the customs duty on luxury articles to 10/&amp; instead of 7^ and to 15^ on tobacco and liquor. It is estimated that the , I additional revenue from these sources will produce about Rs.48,000, while, as mentioned above, economies in the Police will produce another Hs.20,000, making Ks.68,000 in all. Further Shaikh Isa's health has been exceedingly bad of late and Doctor Dame of the American Mission told me that he thought there was little likelihood of his living much longer. He has an allowance of Rs. 5,000 per mensem, i.e.Rs. 60,000 per annum, and if this also can be saved there will then be some prospect of balancing the budget in the near future. On the other hand it is clear that without the increase in the tariff for which % permission is now sought there is no possibility of doing so, and the State will have to live on its reserves until these are exhausted. It will be a race between the return of better times and the exhaustion of the reserves, and having regard to the fact that Bahrain depends entirely on a luxury trade, namely, the sale of pearls, which will probably revive but slowly, there is little doubt which will occur first. 1 4. How I would venture to ask whether the question of the * grant to this small Principality of tariff autonomy could not be re-considered. The government of India in their telegram Ho. 715 of the 5th March 1932 recommended a flat rate of increase on all articles. To this t/ie Shaikh and the financial Adviser are both strongly opposed. At the present time a large portion of the population are on the brink of starvation and there is a great deal of unemployment and tnything which might ooneeiTably _ ..... i&amp;Ctf&amp;Rpn*-3- increase even to some small extent the cost of living would tell heavily apon them. The Political Agent writess ' I believe that, small though the addition is, it would prove a very heavy burden, particularly to nakhudas, who have to provision large numbers of boats. Most of these men are having the greatest difficulty in fitting out boats this year, and this additional impost might well prove the last straw for many. The great majority of the inhabitants of Bahrain are desperately poor, and any increase in the price of necessities of life would bring them still nearer the starvation line. The customs dues last year brought in Rs,5,09,000, so an all round enhancement from 5% to 7^ would, in theory, bring in another lakhs. I feel certain, however, that the increase would lead to diminished consumption, and also probably to diving boats obtaining their supplies at a cheaper port, and the actual increased yield might be as low as a lakh of rupees'. 5. I have mentioned this to show that there are draw backs to an all round flat rate of increase as suggested by the Government of India, and also to show that the State fully realises the undesirability, at the present juncture at any rate, of taxing the necessities of life? there is therefore no likelihood of any concession made to them in this respect being abused, ITurther, there are two safeguards. Firstly, as pointed out by Captain Prior in paragraph 8 of his letter a referred to above, the merchant community are extremely vocal in Bahrain and would not hesitate to express themselves freely if the duties were greatly increased and this whole some check coupled with the advice of the Political Resident &gt;) should ensure that this privilege was not abused. Secondly, the Bahrain Government has always to bear in mind that high duties may divert trade to cheaper ports. For instance a certain ,,,,— . J-4- eertain proportion of the sugar now imported into tlie Arab coast certainly finds its way ultimately into Persia, and this will ineTitably be the case so long as the Persian uorerru. ment impose extremely high duties on sugar# At present a great deal of this sugar comes, in the first instance, from Bahrain, but if the Bahrain Government imposed high duties on sugar, it would probably be diverted to Debai and the same thing applies to many other articles. As mentioned above by the Political Agent, the nakhudas fitting out pearling boats would certainly obtain supplies elsewhere if the cost of the necessities of life was raised in Bahrain# I have shown, therefore, I think, that there is in practice little risk of abuse of any concession that may be made to the Bahrain State in this connection. 6. I would however venture to support my request by arguments based on somewhat wider grounds, Firstly, it seems to me that to hold these small Principalities in fino-ncial bondage on the strength of treaties entered into many years ago, when conditions were very different, is opposed to the spirit of the times. Then at any rate we could point to the fact that the Government of India themselves only had a 5;v revenue tariff, and that Great Britain was a free-trade country. We practised what we preached. This can hardly be said to he the case now. 7. Secondly, any person residing in the Persian Uoilf, as I do, cannot help being struck with the great difference between the great regard shown to Persian susceptibilities and, if I may say so, the somewhat scanty regard fchown to Arab susceptibilities. To Persia we have accorded tariff autonomy and we have also accepted in the case of that country the unilateral denunciation of treaties. To the Arab ...-5- s Arab Principalities we grant grudgingly even small concessions. The only explanation is that in the one case we are dealing with a relatively large power and in the other case with small men, an explanation which, if I may say so, hardly redounds to our credit. 8. Thirdly, I do not see what practical advantage we gain by insisting on our strict treaty rights in the matter of tariff, while on the other hand we certainly incur a certain amount of odium by doing so. The bulk of British and Indian imports into this State consists of rice, coffee, tea, and a certain amount of piece-goods. Sugar though shown in the Trade Report as Indian because it is imported from India is seldom of Indian orgin. There is^owever, no likelihood of the duties on these necessities of life being increased at the present time and ample safeguards against it, and even should a small increase be imposed when more prosperous years come it would certainly not be sufficient in any way to restrict consumption and therefore would not affect British or Indian trade, 9. Finally, these rigid tariff restrictions do impose difficulties on the local administration. Once a flat rate of duty is abandoned and differential rates imposed on different classes of articles, the rates of duty imposed jbr at first at any rate must be more or less experimental. It may be found that some articles will bear a heavier rate while others will not bear the rate imposed. Gomaercial conditions change and prices fluctuate, and they may necessitate a re adjustment of tariff from time to time. If the ykowers of the State are rigorously limited the scope for adjustments is very small, 10. I mentioned above that I thought we were by our present ....&lt; c(3) present policy incurring a certain amount of odium,, The Bulers and people of these States are aware that the Government of India have themselves raised their tariff in many cases to very high figures. They are aware that His Maj esty's Government have also imposed duties; they know that practically the only source of revenue in their State is customs and that their States are on the verge of insolvency, and yet despite this their hands are tied hy antiquated treaties from which they cannot escape. It is undoubtedly the subject of adverse comment. 11. I would therefore venture to ask whether we could not now relax these bonds and authorise the Bahrain Government to levy such duties as seem to it good. If, however, this view is not accepted, I would request that the consent of His Majesty's Government may be obtained to an increase of the tariff on luxury articles to 10% and on tobacco and liquor to 15%. I am sending a copy of this Despatch to His Majesty's y Secretary of State for India. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. v it. Colonel Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

It will be seen that certain articles are classed as luxuries which do not usually fall within that category,but the argument presumably is that if the Ruler does not wear socks,hosiery may be considered a luxury. 2. It will be noticed in the letter from the Adviser enclosed with my letter No:G/62 that the State desires to institute a 15% tax on tobacco,a 15/o tax on liquor and a duty on luxury articles mentioned in the list. I trust it has been found possible to forward their request to the Government of India. I would suggest,however,that since the State may desire to make further alterations at short notice,the Government of India should be asked to take steps to cancel the tariff clause in the treaty which renders the concurrence of His Majesty's Government necessary and accept instead an undertaking from the Bahrain Governmait not to alter their tariffs without the concurrence of the Government of India. i t appears that a formal alteration of the treaty is a very formidable matter and also a very lengthy2, one,whereas if this undertaking were given,which. I feel sure it would readily be,the G-overnmeiit of India would still be able to veto the proposals of the State or to accept them in a much more expeditious fashion. 3. With regard to the query contained in your fourth paragraph it may be noted that the estimated increase in the retail price of rice,supposing the duty to be increased from 5 to 7i^,is estimated to amount to 3 Pies per ruba of 4 Lbs. I take the opportunity to make a point,which,so far as I am aware,has not been considered before. The Islands of Bahrain produce nothing except pearls,lucerne grass and a few dates,everything else (including large quantities of dates) being imported. It will be seen,therefore,that the inhabitants are paying customs duty on everything they purchase instead of merely A that portion of their day to day requirements not available in their country's own resources,and this should be taken into consideration when assessing the effect of increased duties. If,for example,an inhabitant of India,wishes to build a house,he can use timber from the nearest jungle. In Bahrain all chandals are imported. Should he desire to buy 'jus T to plaster his walls,the Bahraini will probably have to import it from Qatar and pay duty on this too. The situation is roughly what might arise if the Isle of light were to be separated from the rest of England and required to pay customs duties upon all its importations from the mainland I have the honour to be Sir, lour Most Obedient Servant, Political Agent, Bahrain.(X^ 57 { w vo-.a/nn. /0&gt; v 0° 5- 0 From:- buo- ^EftiDgNCt. lirU Political Agency, Bah rain, the 11th May 1932.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No:1407-^ dated the 30th April 1932 and to say that the suggestion that the enhaaced customs duties should 'be collected in the form of khanchiyah pending their sanction by the Government of India is quite impracticalDle,for treaty obligations cannot be circum vented by giving a customs duty a different name. So long as a duty is levied upon the import of goods into the country,it is a customs duty and as such cannot be enhanced without the concurrence of the G-overnment of India. The Government of India have been approached regarding the increase of customs duties and their reply must be awaited. 2. The 2/o khanchiyah on tobacco is contrary to the treaty since it is in fact an additional customs duty of and the only reason for my not objecting to it before is that I found it , in force on my arrival and that the amount involved was not large, then the financial situation improves it will also be necessary to review the extra khanchiyah on all goods levied last year since this is far greater than a demurrage charge should be,which is what it is intended to represent.

I discussed this matter with Howell a few days ago on our way up to Basrah and showed him my .letter. Me said that the Tiews contained in it seemed to him eminently reason able, and that the only criticism he had to make was that, though there was little risk of such a thing happening with the present ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Hamad, possibly if he was succeeded by some stronger Sbaikh the latter might not accept our advice regarding the modifications of the tariff and might impose heavy duties against British or indian goods. To this I replied that, firstly, Bahrain could never raise its customs very much on the ordinary necessities oi life, which form the bulk of the imports, such as rice, sugar, coffee, etc., because a large proportion of these goods were not consumed in Bahrain itself but were either exported to other places on the Arabian or Persian coast or bought by Nakhudas for consumption at sea during the four or five months of the pearling season, and if Bahrain raised tHese duties they would inevitably purchase from a cheaper port, e.g. Debai. Howell admitted the force of this. Seccndly, the mercantile community of Bahrain will, I think, always wield a great deal of Influence. It is a purely commercial and pearling centre and it is not as though the Shaikh was the head of a tribe or had or was ever likely to have any armed Metcalfe,Esq. ,0.1 .3. ,2i .V.O., 3 ting foreign secretary to the Government of India, Simlp.■-2- armed force at his dispoaal, apart from the local police, and could ride rough-shod or oppress the mercantile community.

BASRAH TARIFF. Sir, I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with India Office Printed Letter J4o.P.2..38i9/32, dated the 21st July 1932, on the subject of the grant of tariff autonomy to Bahrain, 2. Some time after the issue of Sir Hugh Biscoe^s des- p patch 110.302.3, dated the 13th May 1932, and the endorsement { of kis proposals by the Government of India, Captain Prior pointed out that it would be preferable if the autonoigy pro posed to be granted to the Bahrain State was qualified to the extent that changes in the tariff should be subject to the Political Resident* a approval. This would prevent abuse and would at the same time ensure that necessary and beneficial measures would be introduced with a minimum of delay. Sir Hugh Biscoe agreed generally with Captain Prior and intended to discuss the matter in London and suggest the introduction of ....2- of a proTiao necessitating prior consultation with the British a-itnor ities»i• e. f in practioe, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, before any changes in the tariff were made. X am of the same opinion as the late Sir Hugh Biscoe. f« hare at present in Bahrain a complaisant Shaikh and a British AdTiser selected by us. A future Shaikh, however, may not be as complaisant, and the day may come when full tariff autonomy without any check from us might well result in tue introduction by the Ruler ©f changes dainaging to the interests of His Majesty* s GoTernment and the Government of India. 4. This would be avoided by the insertion of the proviso necessitating prior permission from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, On the one hand the State would be enabled to obtain permission from the Political Resident to alter its tariffs without the unavoidable delay necessitated by a reference to His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, and on the other a salutary check would be imposed on the vagaries of the Ruler, I am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India.

The Hon'hle the Political Hesiaent BuSHiRE RESIDENCY. __ ■in, the Persian Gulf.j Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to forward for your information copies of the Annual Report of the Adviser to the Bahrain G-overnment. The report is interesting and deals with the affairs of the State in considerable detail and since most items are self explanatory,I will not go into them at length. 2. Tfithout wishing to appear unduly depressing I must say that I do not consider the State is likely to receive the income estimated for in the 1351 Budget. The customs dues are ad valorem and until world prices show an upward move there is no possibility of their increasing. ?urther,Bahrair is almost entirely dependent on the pearl trade for a living,and the last three years haseexhausted the capital of almost all the merchants. This would,ofcourse,reduce the purchasing power of the State and nothing but a narked recovery in pearls will replace it. Of this recovery I see no signs at all. 3. Among factors which will have a bad effect on State revenues are the famine in South Persia which,by depriving the minor Persian Ports of their usual exports of grain and livestock,has made it difficult for them to find the money to finance imports from Bahrain. Another cloud on the horizon is the possibility of loss of revenue from the re export trade to the Mainland, should G-overnment force the State to adhere to the arrangements entered into years ago. If this is done the British India Steam Navigation-2- Oompaiiy and other Gompanies will be forced by rlejdi merchants to give free overside delivery and .Bahrain will be headed directly for bankruptcy. 4. I must confess I do not always understand the Adviser's system of accounting,or statements such as that on Page 58 that :, had the Huharraq scheme not been entered the loss per mensem would have been greater'. Actually the extension of the electric light to .uharraq_ has been a most unfortunate business,for it was undertaken without securing any undertaking from merchants resident there that they would connect themselves tf to the supply, and few have availed themselves of it. Since the capital expenditure was over Pis.50,000 the State loses at least Rs.2,000 a year in loss of interest,without any tangible advantage,the current sold in Muharraq_ has barely covered the cost of generating and transmitting it there,owing to the very heavy transformer losses due to the distance involved. The Adviser would do well to consult the Political Agent more fully before undertaking works of ifnportance,since he has little or no experience of administration outside Bahrain. 5. The absence of any form of audit in the State is a grave defect and the Adviser's attention has been repeatedly drawn to it. Now that commercial undertakings such as the Jlectric Light Supply are under State control,the need for an efficient audit is greater than ever. I have the honour to be Sir, You11 1 from o.

The total budgeted for is the lowest r.snonnt oinco there have been budgets for the Bahrain State, It is nearly half a lae less than last year's budget and even so it is imposaible to guaran tee with any degree of certainty that the revenue which is estimated on the receipt side will be forthconing. If the revenue falls short or the expenditure excee 's the budget figure the only res urce which the govemisent will be able to utilise, apart from the Reserve fund, is the small sum of Hs 24 ,540/- which was the balance fron the year 1250.

Preliminary. The complete lack of supervision ©i ther by the ov rn- ment or even the Shera over estates of widows, minors and orphans has during recent yeare been the subject of much criticism in Bahrein. It is a notorious fact that this attitude of indifference on the part of the Government has led to innumerable instances of mis appropriation by executors of wills end by persons ap pointed by wills or by the Kadis to administer estates of deceased persons. About six years ago Major Daly, then olitical Officer, attempted to introduce certain reforms in this direction. He succeeded to some extent but when hi left Bahrain opposition was organiser, at that time mainly by the religious leaders, and the measures were withdrawn. Particular instances. During the last year or two a number of cases have come before the Bahrain Court revealing a most unsatis factory condition of affairs. Innumerable was en and children have been robbed and cheated by persons who were supposed to be guarding their interests and adminis tering their estates. In many cases the general pub lic wero aware of the facts but nobody considered it his duty to inform the court, and the p ople who were being robbed were incapable of complaining. It is beyond the scope of this not© to ive particulars of ell these cases but two or three instances are enough to show wh? t has been happening. 1. Ahuod bin Bashid al llaiai, the eldest brother of a young family whose father died was appointed by the-2- ths Jn ni Ksdis es guardian of his youn brothers end sisters and edmiaistrator of deceased father' b which was worth about lacs. ter two years on© of the brothers oast© of ag® and filed a iriit de.oand- ing to see the accounts of the administration. Out of the original estate there only remained about Es S8,000/-, the rest had 'gone into the sea', it had been lost in diving speculation. 2, Ali bin Seggar, a lea ing Muharraq, pearl merchant was appointed by will as administrator of his brothers estate of 12 lacs which consisted mostly of mish which was realised from pearls at the time of his death. For about eight yearp he kept the heirs quiet by annual pay ents, they being mostly women and children. Dur ing the slump on the pearl market he fell into financial difficulties, and became partly paralysed, the heirs msde a case asking to see the accounts end it was found that prscticolly nothing remained of his brother's estate except two houses, al of it had disappeared in diving. The Court has taken possession of the title deeds of di bin -eggar T s own property which in noma! times should be almost sufficient to satisfy the oltins of the heirs. 3, In another case two cousins, the Siadia, took possession of their uncles estate and disregarding the other heirs, who were minors, enjoyed it for many years, finally they quarelled over the spoils and the -atter came before the Court. The original estate was valued at about 10 lacs. . It was found that about three lacs of rupees were buried in an empty house in lluhsrraq.. This money was taken over by the Government and put in the Bank# The shares of one of the heirs, a young man,ojl /w ' i **3— mea, and elso his sister, were proved and the amount due to then was deposited in their nam©. The balance of the money and « large anount of property is now the subject matter of a lengthy and very scaplieated ease which has been ftoims on in the Bahrain Court for over two years. There are indiesa other caaea of the same sort in which women and children end in one case a blind man have been swindled out of their rights by the adminis trator a of the estate which they should inherit. Recent lean years have aggreyated the conditions in most cases the money was lost in diving, although it is strictly forbidden by lloiiaaedan law for the adsinistrators of estates to speculate with the money which they are entrusted with in dangerous trade. They are persited to invest in property or to use the money in trade os long as it is not of a dangerous nature and on condition that the administrator possess an equivalent capital hlaself with which he can refund the estate if any dis aster occu;a, but in Bahrain the law of the Shera in this respect is disregarded. Government issues proclamation. These cases, and many others, were reported by the Bahrein Court to Shaikh Hamad in detail. Yarious dis cussions and meetings took piece, the Kadis were inter viewed and a proclamation was composed somewhat on the lines of one previously issued by the iigency six months before which had been accented by the public, without objection. It required that all wills should be re is- tered by the CoverniBent before baiag executed and in the case of persons dying intestate the executor should not act before informing the Government. It specially^ '.p 1 (w?) is ?!uhf}.rraq and Ik id held private etin.s on the sub ject, end began to organise petitions and .-eneret opposition. a smell section of the ianasn jhias, one particular faction combined with the Arabs end entered into a aolenn agreement that they would work together with the iiTfebs against the Government in this or any future question which appeared to require cosbine! on- position# It is rsany years since an alliance of this nature « bs made by the Bahama with the ..rabs. ' - —— A nnuber of loc 1 notables es well the members of tho unicipal councils were sent for by me end the let ter wes explained to the/- again. They all understood and in most casas the younrer and nor®.progressive men expressed their approval, but the old conservative type of men did not. All of the® s«id that the general pub lic were opposed to the meosure as they had heard various incorrect statements about it. It was afterwards ascer tained that deliberate propogende organised partly b th- 3unni Kadis and by a cert- f in f.-ction in l/uharraq and edd had been srread among the illiterate and ignorant people who form the greater proportion of the population of those two towns. They were told that the Government meant to take one quarter of the property of everyone who 4*4 died; that all women who died were to be medically examined; that the families of people who died would be instantly turned out of their houses, and many other elaimiag stories. All this time ,hsikh Haard was out at Sakhir, but Shaikh Abdul la was in Muharratj. This was the time of the Resident's visit to Hasee and there is no doubt that his presence here had the effect of postponing the disturbances which ocurred later on.On 6th eb. about thirty people^ mostly seeoad rat© merchants frorn Mukarraq and iiedd, went out to Sakhir end. had an audience with Shaikh Haaad, They demanded that the prooleaatioa should be cancel led. One of then in particular spoke very violently on the subject. (Since then a case has been brought against him for Misappropriating the property of sor-e minors) Somewhat to their surprise .Shaikh Hawd re^lie-! to very firmly telling the® that the preaent condition of things was disgraceful and %m4tcould not be allowed to continue. They left without obtaining any concession. Unfortunately this firs attitude not aainteined; it was suggested this same night that the proclamation should be taken down from the notice boards, secretly. However this was not done. The lid of fitr was on 8th Feb. Contrary to his usual custom Shaikh Hrav d did not visit uharraq on the second day of the - id. In conditions were normal but in 'uharra^ the Kid was not celebreted in the ordinary way. The slaves who dance outsiie the houses of the Shaikhs, a great feature of this Kid, did not appear, they had been given orders not to come. Crowds collected on the pier waiting to nak® a demonstration, speeches were sade by people in the 3az? era. Bazaars Close. On the day after the iiid all the shops and offices in the 'ansae and uharraq baz arr. were close;. This demons tration ori daated in Muharraq where some of the leading merchants set the example, others did the seme and the small shopkeepers closei their stores as they were afraid that the baz- ar might be looted. In Mrnema rumours were(g) were circulated that a mob of divers were coiaing over from iuharraq. to raid the bezaar and certain of the Mans ma jhias closed tr.eir 5*hor&gt;» end oers^aded their noi 'hbours to do tlie mm, the lea inr ^rab end foreign merchants, seeing thrt moat of the bessar was closed, shut up their ■nieces of business and went hto^e. On the next day none of the shops opened, including the meat fish and vegetable markets. In the morning Shaikh Hai?*d sent for Shaikh Abdtilla, Sueikh Heshid, nyself end about hf If tdo?,en of the leading ^robs including Kenoo, Zeyani and Yousuf nkhroo. At the same time, by chonce, a number of the Khulifrh Shaikh- lings, nephews end sons of Shaikh Haaad, «ent out to Sakhir to c; 11 on hire. Deputation at akhir. The Arabs arrived and dimousse J the alter *or sose time with Sheikh Hamad in n reasonable manner, some advocated a coaprosise by which the overrment couid retire a little without giving in too much, otuere led by Touauf Fekhroo demanded that the proolaaation should be cancelled. Yuauf Kaaoo spoke very strongly urging that the matter should be pushed through, shaikh Sulman adopted the same line end Shaikh Abdulle maintained a neutral attitude, Everyone, including Shaikh iamad, deplored the deliberate lies which had been told to the ignorant people and which -ere the main cause of the agitation. Suddenly, to everyone's aurprise a crowd of about thirty ''am : ma Shiaa arrive. in cars end cane into the Majlis in a state of great excitement. They were aoatly jd -7-'8- ■' : -W mostly smell shopkeepers and, butchers, few of the?! were '.nowri to Shaikh Haffled personally.

The young Ihelifi h o i Wl ikhs, who were sit imr alonr the sides of tike majlis, and Shaikh fiassd's followers who were also present, were obviously furious at the behsvour of the Bah? ma but as Shaikh Hamad made no attempt to call theifi to order it was ianossi le for anyone else to do so. Shaikh Ham d adaptei a conciliatory and almost apole~ getic attitude. ne ade a speech, which was repeatedly interruptei, explaining the naoassity for the proela®?- tion. This nad no effect. The talk went on for about an hour end then people divided themselves up into groups, some going outside and spouting to ether. One or two of the Arabs obviously encouraged tne Baliaraa although tnrough- out the meeting their attitude was respectful.

There is vary little to report on this subject. The schools, with the exception of the Shia sohooX ia Manama are flourishing and well attended end the year has passed without any serious disturbances suoh as oouxred in 1349. £igi)t schools now exist out of which two ere for girls and the others are for boys, the total average attendance is 560 boys and 170 girls, but the attendance varies according to the time of the year. the two school councils, Sunni and Shia, who were sup posed, to assist the? Government in satters concerning Kduoetion but who actually impeded it on every possible occasion, have praotically ceased to exist. The period for which they were elected has terminated and it is not proposed to revive their activities. The administration of the schools is in the hands of Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa srsisted by the Inspector of :4uoation, the latter being responsible for the routine and interior man geaent of the schools. The Maneeia 3hia School is the only one which is not doing well, the attendance of Shies is very small although there ere EG or SO Arab 'unnis going regularly to the school. The reason for this is the incessant quarrels between the various Shia factions in Manaaah and also the feeling aaong the Shies that the school should cot be subject to supervision by the Cunni Insnector of ;;ducation. As the Oovernnsnt of Bahrein is Sunni this attitude is ridiculous but unfortunately it has had the effect of reducing the attendance to shout forty or fifty boys in a school which will hold 150 scholars. Encouragement has been given to the schools owing to the fact that the Ooverasient when appointing young men in the position of clerks or to any vacancies that occurEducation. -2- occnr ia tha Cksveroment aervico invariably selects candidates who hire been loo-illy educated aad who have obtained .leaving certificates fro® the schools, Knthnsiaafit for games, especially for football, con tinues to ifcreate and fetches pre played between the varicma schools.

During the previous year number of the dote trees were manure , as is done in Iraq,, but this year for economical remjons no more manuring has been done.

The reason for this f;ilure was probably the sulphur in the water which gradually saturated the soil and killed the plants. After this experiment Abdul -'ozaibi, who has always taken a great interest in agricnlture offered to plant cot*on in a piece of grou id on the outskirts of Han&amp;meh and this planting was on the whole a wary successful undertaking.

Fortunately tho members of the lajlis are men of sortie standing and until, now they have been/to oouiteract his opposition. At the end of the year elections took place for a new majlis but owing to 'nharram the elections will not be completed until during the first month of the new year.

The previous ^embers were chosen bj the Government, as at that tire the majlie was a new institution and it was politic that they should be ar-nointed, not elected. The aenbere of the majlis were chosen as bein • the leading .i^n of the district and ac^nainted with d-- te oaltivstion.

The practice deve- lope i of transhipping bag cargo at see thus evading these charges; end in view of the situation it was decided to refund to the re-exporter the difference between the pre-existing rate and the new rate. This has been car ried into effect with the result that the net result is a gain to the Stat© of lis 57,944/- instead of the esti mated lakh. At the moment it is doubtful whether the political arrangement was inten ed to include oversides delivery of cargo within the ort Limits, and a legal decision on tikit -.uint |« hftiiv- (Mi vt. If t.se \4»w It tc'cen that any craft may avail itself of the amenities of the port without paying any dues at all, then such oversides delive ries will occur to a greater extant that at present, and the result will be the loss to Bahrain of its two per ent re-export duty, and also the concurrent I port Yard charges. It will be noticed that the collections fro~ pearling licenses exceed the estiaetion by &amp; 16,650/- This result is not due to under-estiration; but it will be remombered that the collections for the year 1349 v.. 11. were less than the estimate by lis 13,968/-. This was because aany licen ses were renewed later then was expected, end owing to the movement of the Huhmsisad^n calendar, the actual receipts fell into the year under report instead of 1349. The receipts froa craft registrations shew a slight gain over the estimate; but this does not so nuch imply that more craft ore registered then formerly, only that a number of registered owners delayed their renewals, and consequently had to nay ten rupees instead of two rupees&amp;&gt; -3- rupeas for each renewal. •file Tobaeoo tax shows s rather unexpected gain due to the increasing quantity of this import.

Sir | f With reference to your letter {P»2# 3819/32) of the /h 21st July addressed to the Foreign Office with regard to the proposed grant of tariff automony to Bahrein and the consequent modification of Article IT of the Bahrein Treaty of 1861, I am directed by the Board of Trade to state, for the infoimation of Secretary oir Samuel Hoare, that they have given consideration to the suggestion made in paragraph 4 of that letter that imports from India should have secured to them perpetual most-favoured- nation treatment in Bahrein #iile imports from other parts of the Empire might possibly not be accorded the right to receive a similar privilege. The Board realise that India has by far the greatest single interest in the trade of Bahrein. It seems to them however, that there might be some justification for criticism of His Majesty's Government if, in the future, discrimination came to be practised against United Kingdom trade while Indian trade was fully safeguarded. would not be possible to attempt to secure a concession for goods from all parts of the Empire without first consulting Kis Majesty's GoTernments in the Dominions, and that, on the other hand, to secure rights for the United Kingdom without giving an opportunity to the Dominions to ask for similar rights might Under Secretary of State, At the same time the Board appreciate the fact that it Political Department, India Office,S.W.I equally3) equally lay His Majesty's (a-OTeriment in the Inited Kingdom open to criticism from other parts of the Empire, It seems to the Board, therefore, that the choice lies 'between accepting the proposal of the uorernment of India that the concession of perpetual most-fayoured-nation treatment should be enjoyed^pnly hy Indian goods and producing some formula to secure that the present rights accorded by Article IT of the 1861 Treaty should be superseded not by rights accorded to goods of a particular origin but by personal rights of the kind already conceded by that treaty. As the Secretary of State will be aware, the Treaty gires m© rights to British goods as such, but only to the goods of 'British subjects of erery denomination'. It seems to the Board, therefore, that the most satisfactory solution of the difficulty might be to substitute for the words 'only to an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent in cash or in kind', at the end of the first sentence of Article IV, the words 'to no other or highner duties than those imposed upon any other goods of the same kind', fhe first sentence of Article IT, as amended, would then read as follows:- 'British subjects of erery denomination,_it is understood, may reside in, and carry on their lawful trade in the territories of Bahrein, their goods being subject to no other or higher duties than ttiose imposed upon any other goods of the same kind'.

The year may be aptly described as a financial rear guard c ction,in which the State suffered loss but retired in good order.

Uyoriginal suggestion never con templated that the State should have complete autonomy but pro posed that they should exercise their autonomy subject to the control of the Political Resident. The 'auri sacra fames' of the al Khalifa may well drive them on to add to the tariff little by little till a formidable barrier has grown up. y '■ delay occurred in my representing these views forpm 3. for the tiiird time was,I believe,due to the impression that Sir Hugh Biscoe was coming to Bahrain and that I should have the opportunity of laying my views before him in person.

This amount, once paid, shall not be demanded again on the same goods if exported from Bahrein to other places....' 2. In the spring of this year, in deference to a request received from Your Excellency, approval was given to the increase, as a temporary measure, of the 'i - - duties in question 0&amp;7-gfS on luxury articles. Despite this relaxation, the financial and eaonomic situation of the Islands remains acute, and I am accordingly now authorised to inform Your Excellency that consequent on further cmsideration of the position, approval is given, as a temporary measure, to the withdrawal of the limitation imposed by Article 4 of 'cne Friendly Convention of 1861 quoted above on Your Excellency's freedom to modify the rates of duty which may be imposed on the goods of British subjeccs, subject to the condition that the goods of all British subjects shall be subject to no other or higher duties on an tnose imposed on any other goods of the same hind. I ani, however, to say that it is desired that Your Excellency should inform the Political Resident and give him an opportunity of mahing any observations which he may considerconsider desirable, before in fact making any change in tariffs, and that concurrence in the temporary modification of the limitation imposed by Article iv of the GcEvention of 1861 is given on the understanding that notice of four months shall be given to 'the Resident of any changes of the nature in question./f -n lo M0.817-S of 1932.

As mentioned by you in discussion with the iion*ble the Political Kesident it is probable that the Bahrain U-overnment will wish to impose immediately on receipt of the document granting it tariff autonomy the enhanced rates mentioned in parag aph 11 of * % Sir Hugh Biscoe's letter JNo.302-3, dated the 13th May 1932. In order to keep within the spirit of the concession and at the same time avoid delay damaging to the State's interests, the best course would be for the State, on receipt of the document mentioned, to apply, through the Political Agent, to the Hon'ble the Political Resident for sanction to enhance the tariff forthwith, referring to their original request made in January last. The Political Resident can then sanction the request. By Order. 'C 2-1 for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I I/f/¥ 110.828-3 of 1932. British Residency &amp; Consulate-General, Bushire, the Slst October 1932. To The Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum . ^ith reference to our conversation on the sut^eot of the financial future of Bahrain. The State having enjoyed a good many years of prosperity is now — like practically every other country in the world - faced with difficult times ahead. Its income depends largely on its ad valorem customs dues, and both the bulk of its imports, and their value, have decreased. The pearl trade, which is by far the State's most important means of support, has during the last two or three years much dirainisheds catches have been poor, and even when pearls are found there is no market for them. Hor is there much prospect of an improvement in the world pearl market for some years to come. The last State budget did not balance, and an encroach ment had to be made into the State's reserves: in other words the State has begun to live on its capital* 2. In these circumstances we were agreed that the finances of the State were now of special concern to us, for the obvious reason that - apart from our trade and commercial interests in the island - should the State fall into serious financial difficulties, it would presumably be to His Majesty's Government that it would turn for assistance. I therefore considered it would be advisable, in which opinion you concurred, for ......iql for a general principle to be placed on record that before the State undertakes any scheme involving large financial expenditure the Financial Adviser should consult the Political Agent, by letting the latter have a detailed statement of the scheme in question. It is hardly necessary for me to explain that I do not make this suggestion with any idea of hampering the Financial Adviser. On the contrary I wish to assist him in his difficult task, which he has carried out with ability, to the best of my power. 3* I take this opportunity of quoting the two test questions which Sir Edward Hilton Young set out in his economic report on 'Iraq when he was called in to assist the government of that country in its financial difficulties. * Is this (i.e. the scheme proposed} r for~the maintenance of order and security ? If not, is it going to increase the productivity of the country ? Expenditure which cannot pass these tests is for Iraq extravagant.' I think the same tests might well be applied to any projects in Bahrain, at ail events until the financial condition of the State shows considerable improvement. I would be grateful if you would convey my views to the Financial Adviser. He might - if you see no objection - bp given a copy of th^.Memorandum.

The Goverrrnent of India endorse this recomendation as a purely temporary measure subject to the safeguards (i) that the goods of all British subjects shall be subject to no other or higher duties than those imposed on other goods of the same kind (ii; that the Political Resident shall be given four months notice of any increa.se in the duties above the rates at present permitted in order that he may have the opportunity of making any observations that he may consider desirable.

To The Hgn'blfJ ^esident . i n the Persian frulf 'i v l Bus hire I iiave the honour to enclose for /our intormation a copy of a letter I have received from the Adviser to the G-overnment of Bahrain which explains itself. The situation he outlines is serious^but not desperate,and I propose to discuss the matter in some detail,and,in view of my impending departure,to outline the action which I recommend should be taken to meet it. 2. In my letter Wo:C/149 dated the 17th August 1932,-while forwaraing the State budget lor the current year,I expressed [ the opinion that I did not consider it likely that the State would receive the amount budgetted for during 1351. This gloomy prediction has been amply fulfilled,and of the deficit of Its.50,000/-,Rs.40,000/- has been incurred under the very head where I anticipated it, vis. Customs, .ath rice at its very lowest price for 30 years and ad valorem dues. it was obvious that even the same volume of trade as the preceding year would not produce the same amount of revenue. However,but for the excessive amount now being paid to the Ruling family,the deficit would not be unreasonable,and considering the amount ol the Reserve Fund.in no way alarm ing. As in all States of this description,the mam finan cial difficulty occurs in fixing the revenues of the Ruler and his relations,and tne matter has been frequently under the consideration oi your predecessors. I would invite a reference m the first place to letxer Ko:519-S dated the fisJxk (g) 6tu December 1926 in which, the Political Agent was informed that tne Civil List was unduly high and should not be allowed to increase. Notwithstanding this,during 1928,an increase ol over Rs.40,000/- took place during Mr.Belgrave T s absence on leave. j, — 2. In nesidency letter No: 1817 datec. the 30th September v .|^ ' 1928 the Political Agent was informed tnat the aim of the State should be to amass a Reserve Fund at least equal to a year's revenue. During practically the whole of the tenure of his appointment Mr.Belgrave nas not ceased to press for a reduction in the Civil List,pointing out that at its normal rate of increase,it would in the course of time absorb tne whole of the State revenues. The onus of obtaining reductions always rests,however,on the Political Agent and my predecessor obtained some undertaking from Shaiidi Hamad to the effect that he would not increase the Civil List without consulting him. .Then,However,Shaikii Hamad increased the Civil List by Rs.36,000 without con sulting: hia .no objection was raised. 4. Jpon assuming charge, of this Agency at the end of April 1929,lir.Belgrave drew my attention to his letters on former occasions regarding the growing Civil List. I went into the matter and it appeared to me that urgent action was necessary but,unfortunately, Colonel Barrett, who was then officiating as Political Resident,aid not share my views and the matter was postponed. In my letter No:24-C dated the 28th July 1929 I again brought forward c|3i the matter,which I nad discussed verbally with him before 111 and also referred to it in my telegram No:922 dated the ,Cj Kj 9th August 1929,with the result that I was allowed to urge a reduction upon the Shaikh and a cut of some Rs.15,000/- in the Civil List was affected. 1^/ 5. The situation,however,continued to deteriorate ana in »&gt;/&gt; my letter No:G/9 of the 15th February 1931 to the late Sir Hugh Biscoe,! pointed out that tne matter was again serious^7 o V — C/ -. and advised a 10^ cut in the A1 Khalifa pay be effected, ims t vcvS 1 ixially carried out,not without some unpleasantness, ana turough an error of Captain Parke's Shaikh Isa's pa/ was omitted from the reductions* o. owing to the shrinkage of revenue,however,the Givil List is far in excess ot the 50/o which Sir Hugh Biscoe consiaeieo. tne ausolute maximum, and I attach tables which snow tiiO i eA.'dvi\e reduction in the Civil List for the past xive }e&amp;isand another table which gives the relative pro— jjoi oions ot tne Civil List to revenue for the past nine years These figures show very clearly to what extent the Al ivhaliia nave received the lion's share of the Bahrain Govern ment's resources. 7. it is clear now that administrative expenditure has reached a minimum which cannot be reduced without loss of efficiency,and the only means by whicn the State can balatice its budget is by further reductions in the allowances of the Euling family,since enhanced Customs dues will produce little. I wish to make it quite clear that the amount shown in the Givil List does not include the amounts paid to members of the Euling family for sitting on courts,or any thing' else that can be described as work. proposals for dealing with the present situation are as follows (i). I do not suggest an immediate reduction in the Civil List. For three years in my King's Birthday speech I prophesied a fall in the pearl market,but this year (though there were no signs of it at the time) I prophesied a rise. This rise has already taken place and tne market is admittedly 25)«,possibly 30^,better than last year. It will take time,however,for this improvement to have effect and I suggest,therefore,tnat the figures for another two months should be studied before any drastic action is taken. The State is still in possession of a Heserve i'und of over 2^- lakhs and in any other country this would be considered a most fortunate situation. We nave to remember,however,that-4- jjalit'ain is entirely dependent on its own resources. (ii). 1 donot consider,h.o¥ireYer,that no action should be taken. Two years ago Shaikh Hamad gave an undertaking that when any member of the Al Khalifa died,he would take advantage of his death to re'duce the Civil List by the amount of his allowance,if necessary,granting a reduced amount to his successors. During my absence the eldest son of Shaikh Muhammad bin Isa al Khalifa died and i regret to say that as the result of the usual pressure,Shaikh Hamad immediately agreed to add the allowance to Shaikh Hulianimad T s pay. For this there is no justification whatever. Shaikh Muhammad is of little value to the State and receives Its.3,500/- for his negligible efforts,his only post being president of the Manama Mmicipality. Moreover,he has large estates,which all bring him in a fair amount and this year,as the date crop has been good,will bring in a larger amount than last year. (iii). I suggest,therefore,that a letter should issue from the Political Hesident to Shaikh Hamad pointing out the deplorable showing of the first half year's iigures; urging every possible economy in the Al Khalifa allow ances and mentioning the instance of the death of Shaikh Muhammad T s son and saying that it is presumed his allowance has been reduced and asking for confirm ation of this fact. It will then be possible for you to vo into the matter unon your visit to Bahrain and ! 0 . . .. . follow up the matter with Shaikh Hamad. Shaikh hamad is a confimed optimist. At the moment he is heavily in debt but this does not restrain him from indulging in expensive buildings,paying for his sons buildings, which are equally unnecessary,and giving away gold daggers etc.,on his usual scale, xiie only means oi countering his optimism is to show him figures (which have to be explained to him by his brother,Shaikh-5- Abdulla,and his son,Siiaiidi Salman) together with specific deiiiands for certain reductions. lie will always be in financial difficulties no matter what his pay is J 8. If,however,the State revenues continue to fall there will be no -option but to make some further cut. I parti cularly request that the reference to the allowances of deceased Al Khalifa should be stressed as Shaikh Isa is suitering from a deadly complaint and may possibly die this cold weather. His wife on whom he is greatly dependent is also ill. His family at the moment have quite decided now they will divide his pay and it will be necessary on your next visit to make it quite clear that this must go towards a general reduction in the Civil List,though,ofcourse,it will be difficult to find a formula to convey this to Shaikh Hamad while his father is still alive. I have the honour to be Sir, Your Most Obedient Servant Political Agent Bahrain.9'° ,5) True Copy. SSi- 728 / 31 1351 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. Dated. 18th, Rajab 1351 16th Novr. 1932. H. B. M's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to enclose a statement of revenue and expenditure showing the financial posi tion of the State at the end of the first half of the current year. I consider that the position is grave especially in view of the present danger which threatens Bahrain's trade with the mainland. X ' There is a deficiency of half a lac in the total revenue. Of this amount Rs 42,000/- is due to the Customs receipts having failed to produce the esti mated revenue. A loan of Rs 8,000/- made to Mohd. bin Subah, head of the bin-Aali tribe in Bahrain, has not yet been repaid; the apparent deficiency of Rs 5,000/- under the heading Rents of Government lands is explainable as this heading includes the rent for the oil concession not payable until December. ^ r On the revenue side the expenditure has exceeded the budget by Rs 4,465/- but this includes some extra ordinary expenditure in connection with disbanding the Indian police and it is probable that the total expen diture on the year will be within the budgeted amount. /^I. To meet the deficiency, after taking over the-2- the balance from 1350, the State has been compelled to borrow Rs 31,000/- from the Deposit account. This account consists of funds, the property of the public, lodged with the Government in respect of Court cases, securities etc. iC O' The Reserve Jfund of three lacs which is on fixed Deposit in India is still intact, but unless the revenue improves considerably during the second half year, which I think is unlikely, it will be necessary to break into this fund in order to repay the money borrowed from the Deposit account. ^ ' A comparison between the first six months of 1350 and 1351 shows that the revenue during 1351 hai diminished by approximately Rs 40,000/-. 7 ' The expenditure during the first six months of 1350 exceeded the expenditure during the same months of 1351 by Rs 67,000/- but of this amount Rs 48,000/- was capital expenditure on the Muharraq electric extension so the real reduction in expenditure a amounts to approximately Rs 19,000/- on the half year. In this connection it must be mentioned that the economies effected by reorganisation of the Police i'orce will not become apparent until during the second half of the year. K Out of the State's total expenditure of Es 400,000/- (four lacs) during the half year the sum of Rs 214,000/- (two lacs fourteen thousand) was paid in the Civil List as salaries to members of the Huling family which does not include emoluments for service, the latter payments being debited under various headings, Judicial, Wakfs, public protection etc. In spite of the■ { ■ --3- 10 w reduction last year the Civil List still absorbs 62% of the total revenue. It has been stated in the past that the Civil List should not exceed half the total revenue, if, during the period under review, the Civil List had been 50^ only the difference would have been Rs 41,000/- which would have covered the deficit on Customs receipts. 1 have the honour to be.

Lieut-Col,, Political Pesident in the Persian Gulf.yiu COHFIDr ktial, No. C-4b 1922 Office of the Political Reslaent In the Persian Gulf. Camp, Bahrain, datea 10th Deceiiiber 1932 Sub.iect : Banraln 1 Inances / Sir, I have the honour to refer to Captain Prior's letter No. C/202, of 25th November 1932, on the suoject of the finances of the Bahrain State. 2, You will remember that we alscuesed this import- -ant question with Mr. Belgrave, the Financial Aovlser to the State. Mr. Belgrave - as he had previously Intlmat- -ea Id his letter - concurred in our opinion that the financial position of the State was serious. Tiaere is no neeo for me to recapitulate the details of this posit- -ion , which have - of late - often been referred to In various aespatches. Briefly the prosperity ol tae State largely - one might say mainly - depenas on two factors which may be laoellea as more or less artificial; the pearl trade, anu the transit trade on which the State takes customs oues. The former trade has consicerably ciminished, ana the latter is also tnreatenea with alrain- -ution if not with extinction. To this must be aaaea the trade depression all over tne world, ana tae arop in the price of commoaitles. which - as the State derives its largest quota of revenue from ad valorem customs ciuec has naturally causea a considerable decrease in receipts to the Treasury. 3 Tne Political Agent Bahrain3 The drop In the pearl trade is, of course, quite unoerstanaable. Pearls are a pure luxury, ana In the present state of general financial stringency the ccmand for these luxuries is naturally small. There has, however, been a recent rise in prices, ( viae para- -graph 7 (i) of Captain Prior's letter No. C«202 of 2bth November 1932, and we cah only hope that this will con- % -t inue. 4. The question of the Transit Trace is a more complicated one and has been dealt with in ray despatch No. C/44, of 10th December 1932. 5. It is obvious that some considerable econo^ should be maae in the State 's expenditure, and the most obvious source for such an economy is, as Captain Prior points out in his letter quoted above, the Civil List, which - vice paragraph 8 of Br. Belgrave's letter oi 18th November •&gt; absorbs 62/C of the total revenue. One com— -paratively simple way of reducing the List is for the Shaikh, on the death of a member of the Al Khalifa family, to cancel his allowance, or at any rate to giant a reduced amount to his successor ( vide paraguaph 7 (li) ar.d (iii) of Captain Prior's letter). Mr. Belgrave informed us that he had had - on a definite order from His Excellency - to pay Shaikh Muhammad the first month's full allowance of his deceased son. 6. There is also the question of the far larger allov-ance of the late Shaikh tea ( *ho alec yeeteraay), amounting to over as. 60.000 - per annum ( paragraph 8 of Captain rrior'e letter). m olacueaing this question we agreed that aome imrceoiate action was necessary to prevent the Shaikh passing orders, which later he might lino difficult to resoino, olvicing tnis allowance amongst members of the Al Khalifa family - himsell includ- .ed. We are going to pay a visit of condolence on tueo- t 3 the Shaikh thl&amp; afternoon, and I will leave behind a letter for His Excellency, copy of which is enclosed, ^* ^hen you have your interview with the Shaikh on the matter of Shaikh Isa'fe allowance your object will be, of course, to point out to him once again the ser- -ioos financial situation of his government and to press him to let a large proportion of the allowance, if poss- -ible the whole, lapse to the State. The argument that if the State finally becomes bankrupt , whicn appears not too unlikely if drastic economies are not maae, H.M's. Government may have to step in and assume complete financial control, may have some effect on the Shaikh, and more probably on his family, if you care to use it. 6 It would be an excellent thing if Bone stanfi- -ard for the Civil List could be fixed in relation to the prosperity, or otherwise, of the State. In discusB -ing this point you suggested that a sliding scale for the Civil List, with a maximum and perhaps a minlnmm limit, might be fixed in proportion to the gross revenue of the State. Mr. Belgrave agreed with this sugeestion in principle, and so do I. You might discuss this matter further with Mr. Belgrave, and let me know now far it would be practicable to institute the proposed scale. 9 The Civil List is the most obvious item in which economies could be maOe. There may. however, be othe^-ano I would be glad « y ou wouW ex P l0Ie other avenues of economy ttie.'f; may be. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut-Col., Political pesident in the Persian Gult. oTranslation of letter dated 12th. Siiaban 1351 (11th. ^ec^mber 1938 )from His Excellency Shaikh Hamad hin Isa ^ n wto f ^^rstin addressed to Lieut. Colonel .0.w.Iowle , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After compliments. I have received your kind letter No.1530 and the contents have duly be en noted by Your Excellency's friend , particularly that you desired to discuss with your friend in matters relating to finance for which you could not get an opportunity. I thank you for your endtprour and for the Advice conveyed by your kind letter. Your Excellency has also mentioned that Captain Prior drew my attention by his letter No.991 dated 17th. August 1929.
