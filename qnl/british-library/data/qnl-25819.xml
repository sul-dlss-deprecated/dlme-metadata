LETTER SENT ON Please return the form with or without the accompanying letter, marking one or more of the sentences overleaf with an X. COMMENT. The writer complains of indifferent treatment of Swiss engineers and other Europeans by the government 6f Afghanistan and considers that technical science and industry is completely wasted on the natives. Writer says:- 'It is unfortunately characteristic in every letter to return to the dark side of things in this country and that they bear a different aspect from that seen by Annemarie Schwazenbach during her travels, for she was a guest, and a guest who intended to write articles about the country and to whom on that account it was desirable, if possible, to show things in their best light. But we, being here 'only' to work for the country are often treated vvorse than itue lowest servants •e at homef, • -v as rega rds our ./ork, lec Ilk school boys who have broken God knows wbiatT In one thing I might perhpaa be in acco 1 ^! wit; Annemarie - that the attempt to-nrjQUse this countr r from its 'Sleeping Beauty' slumbers thr ugh technical science and industry has been a total failure, its people would certainly be happier with their old patriarchal customs: as agriculturalists - half nomads, isolated from the world. It is also hopeless to attempt to educate the young people if the chief result is to be their conviction in later life that to work is disgraceful. The best thing the Minister (of Public W'orks) here could do would be to send us Europeans home as soon as possible, then they would at least save J a lot of ROOM (or D, P.C. 67 Department) Privabe.
