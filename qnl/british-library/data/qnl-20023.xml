India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, 12th August 1895. With reference to the correspondence emling with your letter of 10th October 1890, ami to the papers forwarded to you on the 27th July 1895,* relative to the recent rebellion in Muscat, I am desired by Lord George Hamilton to forward herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter from the Government of India, No. 1&amp;?, Secret (External), dated the 9th July 1895, and its enclosures, in which Lord Elgin's Governmeiit discuss the present situation in Oman, and the considerations by which their future policy should be guided. 2. They point out that the authority of the Sultan is limited and feeble, that future troubles are anticipated, probably at an early date, and that the protection of our important interests in the coast towns of Muscat and Mattrah cannot safely be left to Ins unaided efforts. Three plans have been suggested for securing the protection of British interests. The first, which involves the annexation of Muscat and Mattrah, and the pensioning of the Sultan, is not advocated by the local officers, and need not be discussed. 3. With regard to the second proposal—the establishment of an exclusive British Protectorate—the Government of India say that they adhere to the views expressed by Lord Lansdowne's Government; but they recognise that France would almost certainly object to the establish ment of a British Protectorate over Oman, and might demand for the abrogation of the Anglo-French Declaration of the 10th March 1862 a price which would be more than the Protectorate is worth. They do not therefore anticipate that Her Majesty's Government will think it prudent to open negotiations on the subject with France at the present juncture. 4. The last course suggested, to which the Government of India incline, is that advised by the Political Agent at Muscat, viz., that the leading Sheikhs of Oman should be warned that, whatever dill'erences they may have with their Sultan, the Government of India will not permit attacks on Muscat and Mattrah. 5. The Government of India consider this course the more desirable, because, as long as they maintain a policy of strict non-intervention, disturbances are likely to recur ; and, unless we take steps^to define our position, there is risk of our becoming involved, however involuntarily, in discussions not only with the Sultan and the tribes, but also with France. 6. In the event of the assent of France to a British Protectorate over Muscat being unobtainable. Lord George Hamilton proposes that Her Majesty's Government should undertake to protect Muscat and Mattrah from the attacks of rebel Arab tribesmen in the defence of existing commercial interests. I have, &amp;c., A. Godley. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. S. 56. A S I ^ i —.—No. 2. Foreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office, 22nd August 1895. The Marquess of Salisbury has had under his consideration your letter of the 12th of August, enclosing copy of a letter, with its enclosures, from the Government of India relative to the present situation in Oman, and the methods proposed for securing the protection ot British interests. I am directed by His Lordship to state, for the intormation ot Lord George Hamilton, that he concurs in the suggestion made by the Political Agent at Muscat that the leading Sheikhs of Oman should be warned that, whatever differences they may have with their Sultan, the Govern ment of India will not permit attacks on Muscat and Mattrali. Lord Salisbury will be glad to be informed ot any steps that may be taken for this purpose, and of the exact terms in which the warning is given. I am, &amp;c., T. H. Sanderson. The Under Secretary of State for India.No. 14, dated Bushire, the 25th January 1896, From— Colonel P. A. Wilson , Political Resident, Persian Gnlf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. With reference to your letter No. 176o-E. of 20tli September 1895, and connected correspondence, I have the honour to forward copy of letter No. 11, dated the 4)th instant, from the Political Agent at Muscat, submitting copy of the report of the committee appointed to investigate British claims for losses in the late rebellion. The total amount of the losses of British subjects, arrived at after a careful and laborious investigation, is $77,894, which Major Sadler thinks may be taken as a fair estimate. The amount is considerable, and I regret to observe that from the experience so far of the results of the punitive tax and from the attitude the Sultan appears to be assuming, the prospects of its liquidation are by no means satisfactory. 2. In this connection I have the honour further to submit copy of Major Sadler's report No. 16 of the 9th instant, and of its enclosures. Apart from the distorted view regarding the circumstances of the imposition, and scope of the punitive tax, the Sultan appears to have adopted certain strangely unwarrantable assumptions, express or implied. His Highness would seem to regard all liability for the losses of British subjects as entirely confined to the proceeds (in part only), of the punitive tax, and further to consider that no point on which Government may have insisted as regards compensation for these losses, has any force unless or until his own formal assent thereto has been given. 3. The date season has not yet closed, its transactions being probably retarded by the present position, and a final consideration of any extension of the term originally intimated by Government for the liquidation of our claims may await the fuller information which it is hoped may be available in March. I venture meantime, however, to recommend in the sense of Major Sadler's su^estion in the 5th paragraph of his letter, that the Sultan should be informed that his views in the matter are inadmissible, and that it will be necessary to make good from the Zanzibar subsidy, any unsatisfactory failure in the results of the punitive tax which may threaten a delay in the adjust ment which was never contemplated and cannot be accepted; with an intima tion that a final decision regarding details will be deferred till the complete results of the tax at the end of the date season are reported. I agree with the Political Agent that the adjustment should be quarterly, as no useful object can be served by delaying payments till the end of the year. 4. Major Sadler at the close of his first letter records a favourable notice of the credit due to Surgeon-Major Jayakar and the members of the Com mittee for their work in this long and arduous investigation, which I gladly and cordially endorse. It would have been difficult to find an officer more competent for this duty than Surgeon -Major Jayakar, and it is evident that he has spared no pains to carry it to a satisfactory conclusion. No. 11, dated Muscat, the 4th January 1896. p rom Major J. Hayes Sadler , Her Britannic Majesty's Political Agent and Con sul, Muscat, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward a copy of the report of the Committee appointed to investigate the claims of British and British-protected subjects for losses incurred during the rebellion in February and March last. 2. The Committee commenced proceedings on the 26th March and practi- callv concluded their work by the end of September, holding in all 65 sittings. Two hundred and twenty-four claims were examined representing $ 206,040^ and lis. 66,919^, and the amount awarded by the Committee in compensation is § 60 ,392J and Bs. 32,029, or calculated all in dollars § 77,894 which may be 725 F. D.q taken as a fair estimate of the actual losses incurred so far as it has been possi ble to ascertain them. 3. This report shows, what was suspected from the first, that the claims as a whole had been grossly exaggerated, and some glaring instances of dis honest attempt to profit by the general confusion prevalent during the rebellion are given in the body of the report. The attitude of the Baniah community, too, during the early portion of the enquiry was far from satisfactory. Instead of affording the Committee all the assistance in their power in an investigation which was held entirely in their own interests, they seem to have entered on a course of obstruction, and by refusing to take the only steps which, in the absence of direct proof, could give any weight to their individual statements, they threw on the Committee the onus of disproving claims in many cases exaggerated and in some altogether false, and considerably added to the diffi culty the Committee had in obtaining reliable data on which to work. 4. Much credit is due to Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel A. S. Jayakar and the members w T ho worked under him for their patient and laborious conduct of this lengthy investigation. It is to Dr. Jayakar's long experience of Muscat and his acquaintance with the position and business affairs of most of the claimants that the satisfac tory result of the enquiry is due. Report of the Committee for investigating the claims of British and British-protected subjects for compensation on account of the losses suffered by them during the late rebellion in Muscat. The Committee commenced their proceedings with a preliminary meeting on the 26th of March 1895 for the purpose of determining upon a systematic mode of examining the several claims submitted for investigation, and held in all 65 sittings, each sitting lasting about three hours. The work of the Com mittee was practically over by the end of September, but owing to the absence from Muscat at the time, of a few of the claimants, the Committee had to hold a meeting in October and three in November. Two hundred and twenty four separate claims representing a sum of $ 206,040| and Rs. 66,919J as registered in the Office of the Political Agent, were examined. The Committee had from the beginning strong suspicions that most of the claims were highly exaggerated, and these suspicions were to a great extent confirmed as sitting after sitting revealed the absurdity and falsehood of most of the original statements. In the absence of any exact information as to the actual losses, the task before the Committee, as may be easily imagined, was beset with great diffi culties which, they regret to have to report, were further enhanced by the attitude of many of the claimants who, instead of helping the Committee in the best way they could, withheld from them such information as it was in their power to give and as would have considerably lightened the Committee's work. From the extravagant manner in which most of the losses were at first registered, it would seem as if the sufferers were under the impression that their statements would be submitted only to a superficial examination, but in order to undo that impression, if such existed in any case, and considering that most of the losses were registered either during the continuance of the rebellion or immediately after the restoration of peace, when the sufferers had not sufficient time to make a true estimate of their probable losses by examining their account books and estimating the balance of goods, etc., in their hands, the Committee gave every claimant an opportunity of altering and correcting the original claim when it came up for examination. This procedure had, however, no effect in most cases and consequently the Committee had to under take the heavy task of examining the account books in many instances, to form an opinion as to the approximate losses. The Committee would have gladly avoided this had there been anything like a semblance of close approxi mation in the statements of the sufferers. In order to facilitate the execution of their task, the Committee suggested to each claimant the course of stating on oath the losses, but the Hindu claimants as a body refused at first to make any statements whatever on oath.on the ground of religious scruples, owing to a want of certainty in the actual amount of their losses, which greatly impeded at first the efforts of the Com mittee to obtain reliable data on which to base a probable estimate of the losses. Had all the Hindus from the beginning adopted the course suggested by the Committee and which subsequently many of them followed, the task might have been a comparatively lighter one, but although real religious pre judice deterred a few conscientious and scrupulous men from making such statements on oath, the Committee have had reasons to believe that in many instances it was the guilty knowledge of their false statements that prevented them from accepting this course. The principal aim of the Committee has been to determine as closely as possible the approximate probable losses of the sufferers due actually to plunder and destruction, and this they strictly kept in view while investigat ing the several claims for compensation. The Committee have had accord ingly to reject all claims for expenses incurred in removing goods from Muscat during its occupation by the rebels and storing them in places of security. Although the Committee readily admit that in some instances such expenses were rather heavy, they are of opinion that if the principle on which they could be allowed were made applicable to such persons as had actually suffered losses, it would have had to be extended to the people of Matrah too, who also had to undergo similar expenses in removing and storing their goods as a precautionary measure, but who suffered no actual losses owing to the non-occupation of that place by the rebels. Besides, had the goods been removed in anticipation of the rebellion, should such a course have been pos sible, in consequence of which action no actual losses had occurred, the Com mittee think that no claim for compensation simply for expenses incurred in removing goods as a precautionary measure would have been either made or allowed. Further, if the principle of such incidental expenses were admitted, the Committee might have had to consider other losses due indirectly to the rebellion, such as claims of accounts and outstandings, the recovery of which has now been materially affected by that event. In the case of merchants the work of determining theii* losses in goods seemed at first, owing to the existence of their dafters, a comparatively easy one, but a deeper examination of the books soon showed the utter impracti cability of arriving at any definite conclusion with regard to all the items included in their statements within the limited time at the command of the Committee. A few important commodities such as rice, wheat, sugar and coffee, but principally the first, had therefore to be selected as a test for verifying the statements, but even here the efforts of the Committee were often ineffectual in the absence of any correct information as to the goods removed by the sufferers during the armistice and of the goods found in their warehouses on their return to Muscat after the declaration of peace. The Committee had in such cases mainly to depend upon the effect of the rebellion, on the financial position of the parties and their general character for veracity. Wherever practicable the evidence of witnesses was taken, and in a few instances con fidential enquiries elicited important information which was of immense assist ance to the Committee. In such cases as appeared to be highly suspicious, the Committee personally visited the warehouses in order to compare the actual balance on hand with the alleged balance as shown in the statements, and this course, though rather tiresome and disagreeable, was attended with a satisfactory result which could not have otherwise been obtained. The Committee regret to have to report that out of the several instances of extravagant statements of losses that came up for examination before them, two were remarkably conspicuous for an utter disregard of truth. In one ot' them, the claimant alleged that 150 bags of rice were plundered from his godown, but by carefully examining his books and making a confidential enquiry, the Committee succeeded in reducing that number to 7. In the other, the claimant's statement that 1 ,500 dollars' worth of wheat was plundered from his godown in Muscat, was found on an inspection of the situation of the godown and a confidential enquiry to be utterly devoid of truth. In three of the cases, it was found that the claimants had included in their claims for compensation the price of 525 bags of rice (Murarjee Lakhmidas4 270 bags, Eattansi Parsliottam 180 bags and Veerjee Rattansee 75 bags) sold by tbem to the rebel leaders Sheikh Salih bin AU and Muhasan bin Amir during the rebellion, the claimants alleging as their reason for doing so, that thev had not received receipts for the goods from the purchasers, though they admitted that the sales were completed. The Committee having, alter due consideration, come to the conclusion that these claims were beyond the scope of their enquiry, rejected them altogether, leaving it to the claimants to recover the price of' the goods in the usual way. The Committee thmk that the two principal reasons for their action are obvious, namely, that whatever mio-ht have been the motive of the claimants in selling the goods to the rebels, the 5 responsibility of the sales must rest with themselves, and that as sales they could not be held to be in the same category as losses. One of the claimants when submitting his claim for examination, sub mitted also a claim for compensation on behalf of one of his constituents, a German firm in Zanzibar, but the Committee have not allowed it on the '•round of their enquiry being strictly limited to the losses of British and British- protected subjects and of such of their constituents as are British or British- protected subjects. The Committee had to reject three of the registered claims altogether. In the case of Karamsee Jetha, the evidence produced by his representative wag found to be totally insufficient to support the statement of any loss. In the case of Nanjee Ramdas, the claimant having declared that he had counted -just before the rebellion the money which he alleged to have been plundered, was o-iven the choice of either making the statement on oath or producing evidence in support of it, and was repeatedly asked by the Committee to adopt one or the other course, but he failed to produce any evidence and flatly refused to swear to the truth of his statement. The Committee had therefore to throw out his claim altogether. In the case of Khoja Muhammad Abdullah Moosa, neither the claimant nor any agent on his behalf appeared before the Com mittee to prove his loss. It is, however, a well known fact to most of the mem bers of the Committee that he neither possessed a shop nor traded in other manner; it is impossible therefore for the Committee to believe that any piece goods registered by him as belonging to him were plundered. The Committee have now to report that in their opinion the total approxi mate probable losses of all British and British-protected subjects in Muscat and Matrah during the late rebellion, amounted to $60,362^- and Ks. 32,029 and to submit herewith two statements. Appendix A and Appendix B, showing the individual losses of the several sufferers. As, however, it is evident that all the claims in rupees will be paid off in dollars, it would be necessary to convert the rupees into dollars, and with that view the Committee have to suggest that the mean rate between the rate of exchange which was current when the rebel lion broke out (Rs. 177=$100) and the present rate (Rs. 189=:$100), namely, that of Rs. 183 = $100, may be adopted for that purpose. The Committee think that if this rate be adopted now, it would not only be fair to all the parties con cerned, but considering the almost constant fluctuation in exchange, would also remove any source of confusion likely to arise from that cause in the accounts hereafter. lollowmg therefore their own suggestion, the Committee have prepared also a separate list of all the rupee claims, which they submit herewith as Appendix C. The total losses at the suggested rate of exchange for conversion of rupees into dollars, expressed in dollars, would therefore amount to $77,894 and cents 68, out of which sum, losses amounting to $7,030 and cents 78 occurred on the side of the town occupied by His Highness the Sultan's allies, and those amounting to $70,863 and cents 90, on the side occupied by the rebels. This distinction between the two sides is, however, more formal than a real one, the Committee having had nothing to guide them in arriving at a decision in this matter, besides the bare fact of the situation in which the plundered and destroyed property was during the occupation of the town by the rebels and His Highness the Sultan's allies. It is moreover a notorious fact that a part of the heavier kind of goods, such as rice, wheat, sugar and coffee, though situated in the rebel quarter, was plundered by the allies on the night of the evacuation of the town by the rebels. Under such circumstances, the5 Committee regret their inability to express a positive opinion as to the relative share of either party in the work of plunder and destruction. It seems, how ever, evident that the more valuable share of the plunder consisting of money in cash, jewellery and costly but light materials such as silks, gold and silver embroidery, etc., fell principally to the lot of the rebels who could not only most easily carry them off overland, but who had also a long and uninterrupted period of occupation in their favour for that purpose.

No. 16, dated Muscat, tbe 9tb January 1896. f rom Major J. Hayes Sadler , Her Britannic Majesty's Political Agent and Consul, Muscat, To—The Political Resident in tbe Persian Gulf. 1 have the honour to forward copy, with translated purport, of the correspondence which has passed between His Highness the Sultan and this Agency in the matter of the disposal of the money collected from the punitive tax. , 2 I have reminded the Wazir that some months had now elapsed since the tax had been imposed, and intimated that I should be glad if the sum hitherto collected, amounting to about $6,000, were now sent in. The Sultan's letter of the 22nd December was the result. 3. As this somewhat curt letter seemed to me to ignore the orders passed by the Government of India in paragraph 2 of Foreign Department letter No- 1652-E., dated the 30th August 1895, I thought it advisable to see the Sultan myself in the matter. The result of the interview was not satisfactory. Without actually saying so the Sultan wished me to believe that he was not aware of the orders which had been passed regarding the claims of Muscat subjects, and you will observe that this is what he implies in his second letter. The fact was that Surgeon- Lieutenant -Colonel A. S. Jayakar communicated the purport of the decision of Government personally to the Sultan on the 20th September 1895 and recorded a note to that effect in the file. The communication was notthen made in writing as the Agency Munshi had died and no one had been appointed in his place. The line taken up by the Sultan was that the NotiScation imposing the tax had been issued by the two Governments—the British Government and himself—that therefore the rights of his subjects in the proceeds were equal to those of our subjects, and that it was neither right nor just to leave the claims of Muscat subjects to be settled after those of our people had been adjusted. To these views he obstinately adhered throughout the interview. When I reminded him that the tax had been imposed at the instance of the British Government for the express purpose of compensating British subjects for the losses they had sustained during the rebellion, that the payment of the compensation in the form of a tax on his rebellious subjects, as pressing least hardly on His Highness, and the permission which had been given for the claims of his subjects to be met from the tax after British claims had been satisfied, were in themselves concessions, and that this very question of Muscat claims had been referred to Government, and orders passed thereon, the Sultan replied that the effects of the rebellion had been felt by his own subjects equally with ours and that the Notification was issued by him as much as by the British Government, and he repeatedly asked me whether he had intimated his acceptance of the orders of Government as to the priority of British claims. 4. This opposition on the part of the Sultan comes with particularly bad grace at the present time, and I venture to opine that the views he has expressed will not find favour with the Government of India. The question of extending the period within which the claims of our subjects are to be satisfied will be considered when the report is submitted at the close of the present date season, but as the Sultan seems to be bent on appearing to ignore both the full extent of his liabilities to Government in connection with the events of the rebellion, and the true significance of the fact that the Notification impos ing the tax was issued at the instance of the British Government, it would seem necessary to let him know once for all that further equivocation will not be allowed. I think it desirable, too, that the proceeds of the tax should be paid in everv quarter and not as the Sultan proposes at the close of each year the tax is in force. 5. I would suggest that the Sultan be plainly told that the views expressed in his two letters are inadmissible and that if the proceeds of the tax are not paid in quarterly minus a rateable deduction for the claims oi one American subject and one French subject, which amount to Ks. 955 and about $2,000 respectively, we shall proceed to take our own steps to recover the amount from the Zanzibar Subsidy now paid to His Highness, and this in addi tion to any further deduction that may be necessary should the proceeds be inadequate to meet what Government may consider a fair proportion of the claims for each year, after considering the report on the working of the tax for the present season, which will end in about two months' time. 6. During your interview with the Sultan in November last he mooted the question of a general tax of 6 per cent, on the date produce of Oman, instead of a punitive tax of 10 per cent, on the rebellious tribes, as he attributed the want of suecess hitherto attending his efforts to recover the tax to the connivance of the Ghafiris at the evasion of the tax by the Hinawis. You then observed that the question would be considered at the close of the present season. The Sultan alluded to this in his conversation with me and I reminded him of what you had said. It is, however, a matter for future discussion, and need not, in my opinion, affect the warning which I have suggested should now be given to the Sultan in connection with the correspondence which I enclose.

After -Muhammad bin Azzan has informed us that you wish us to send the money collected on account of the tax imposed for then 13 compensation for plundered property. Know that this money has not yet been collected for the year and it is common to four Governments and it has to be divided, as is just. When it is collected for the whole year we will send you what pertains to the subjects of the Great British Government. May this be known to you. This is what it behoved us to communicate. No. 44, dated the 24th December 1895 (7th Rajab 1313), From— Major J. Hayes Sadlee , Her Britaanic Majesty's Political Agent, and Consul, Muscat, To—His Highness Seyyid Feysal bin Torkee , Sultan of Muscat, After compliments.—1 have received Your Highness's letter, dated the 22nd December 1895 (5th Hajab 1313) and have understood its contents. You write that the money collected from the tax is common to four Governments, and has to be divided, as is just. With regard to this I must remind Your Highness of the decision of Gov ernment which was communicated to you personally by Dr. Jayakaronthe 20th September 1895 (30th Rabi-el-Awal 1313). Your Highness had pro posed to recover the claims of Muscat subjects, of one American, and one French subject, in the same manner and at the same time as prescribed for the claims of British subjects; the matter was referred to the Government of India, and the decision of Government was to the effect that there will be no objection to the losses of the Muscat subjects being recovered from the proceeds of the punitive tax, provided it is understood that the claims of Biitisli Indian sub jects are first discharged and that the period indicated for the final adjustment of claims (three years) is not exceeded. The losses of the two foreign subjects were understood to be of small amount and they were allowed to be treated in the same manner as those of British Indian subjects. Your Highness will, therefore, see that I am unable to accept the prin ciple put forward in your letter under reply that a rateable proportion of the sum now collected should be set apart for the compensation of Muscat subjects. Moreover, Your Highness will remember that this tax was imposed at the instigation of the British Government for the express purpose of compensating British subjects for the losses incurred by them during the war ; Your High ness has already intimated your inability to satisfy the claims of British sub- | jects within the limit of three years, and it is evident that were the losses of Muscat subjects to be met from the tax at the same time as those of British subjects, a settlement of British claims could not be completed within anything approaching the period above indicated. Translated purport of a letter from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, to the Political Agent, Muscat, dated the 31st December 1895 (14th Rajab 1313) . W^e have received your letter, dated the 7th of ilajab, and understood its contents. Dr. Jayakar's visit to us on that day was in connection with the reply to* our letter, dated the 2nd Muharram, about.assisting us should the rebels attack us, and, secondly, in connection with the reply to our letter, dated the 8th Safar, regarding Soor and detaining the (Soori) boats; these were the matters discussed with him. But as regards what you say that what pertains to our subjects of the (proceeds of the) tax should be kept back and that they should not share therein with the (subjects of the) Government, how can they be set aside and deprived of their rights in favour of others ? We put on the tax to meet the claims of the four Governments, and it not just to postpone the claims of Muscat subjects. As to what you have pointed out about the period of three years within which the payment is to be completed, we bave repeated to you both in writing and verbally that we cannot complete the payment within three years, as we have previously told you; and the Sirkar will not approve of aught but justice and equity as is their customary practice.

I am to request that the Political Agent may be instructed to inform the Sultan that the Government of India cannot admit the correctness of the /iews expressed in His Ilighness's two letters to the Political Agent, dated res pectively the (5th and 14th Rajab 1313) 22nd and 31st December 1895; that they accept the sum of $ 77,894, found by the Committee to be due, as the amount awardable in compensation, and that this amount must be paid by quarterly instalments, within three years, minus a rateable deduction for the claims of one American and one Prench subject, otherwise steps will be taken to recover it from the subsidy payable to His Highness. 3. I am to add that the work of Surgeon-Lieutenant-Colonel Jayakar and the Committee is appreciated by the Government of India. SO % /3. ^ ^ ■ourict/2/^ S E—35-46—May. Eid.—W. G. B.ANo. 1137-E.-A. • *. i J From T he SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA, To T he POLITICAL RESIDENT in the PERSIAN GULF. Dated Simla, the 22nd June 1806. FOREIGN DEPT. &gt; X ^ : p i., A ii « : L/ Sir, x Your letter No. 39, dated tbelTth Aj)ril 1896, with the enclosed report by Major Sadler, placed the Government of India in possession of information as to the results of the punitive tax on the export trade of the rebel tribes of Oman. It was originally estimated that the tax might yield up to $20,000 a year. The actual yield from the 1st August 1895, when the tax was imposed, to the middle of March 1896 was under $ 10,000. The admitted claims for compensa tion by British Indian subjects (including one French and one American subject) exceed $ 80,000. The unsatisfactory working of the tax is ascribed partly to the general weakness and inefficiency of the Sultan's administration, and partly to His Highness's want of energy. 2. Under these circumstances Major Sadler suggested two alternative courses : (1) to spread the tax over an additional period of four years from the 1st August next, and to recover from the Zanzibar subsidy any deficiency in the amount required quarterly to make good the compensation within the period fixed ; or (2) to deduct Rs. 3,000 a month from the subsidy from the ]st August next, leaving it to the Sultan to recover the tax as best he can. You agree that one or other of these courses should be adopted. 3. The original* orders contemplated the levy of the punitive tax at a rate • From the Governinent of India in the Foreign Calculated to effect the rOCOVCiy of tllC repartment, No. 1065-E., dated the 29th May 1895. compensation in two. Or at the most in three, years ; and you were then informed that if the Sultan failed to take effective measures for realising the tax he might be warned that it would perhaps become necessary to recover the amount from the Zanzibar subsidy. In March last you were instructedt that the Political Agent should warn His f From the OovernTnent of India in the Foreign HlghllOSS that Steps \\ OLlld be taken Department, No. 641-E., dated the 27th March 1896. to effect TCCOVery in this manner Unless the compensation were paid by quarterly instalments within three years. My telegram of the 22nd May 1896 informed you that, under the circumstances which you explained, you need not interfere with the Sultan's discretion in the matter of taxing the Ghafiris and Major Sadler was of opinion that the joint proceeds of such a tax and of the punitive tax might reach from 3 20,000 to $ 25,000 a year. If this estimate proves correct the full amount of com pensation due' to British Indian subjects may possibly be recovered from the special taxation within four years from 1st August last. 4. The Government of India are nevertheless of opinion that no hope at present should be held out to the Sultan of any extension of the period within ^ which he has been told the compensation must be paid, and your letter No. 54, ■ dated 6th June, which was received when the present orders were about to issue, does not suggest or advise any change in the attitude which the Govern ment of India have hitherto assumed. In these circumstances, if the proceeds ofthe punitive tax up to the 1st May last have not yet been handed over to the Political A^ent, inmediate payment should be demanded. The Sultan should also be informed in unmistakeable terms that, failing payment of the sum already collected, and the quarterly payment in future of the receipts from the special taxation, the amounts due will, without further notice, be recovered from the subsidy. His Highness should also be reminded that if, for any rea son, the proceeds o£ the taxes are found at the end of three years to have been insufficient to liquidate the admitted claim? of British Indian subjects, the balance will be recovered from the subsidy in such manner as the G-overnment of India may then decide. It may be explained to the Sultan that under these orders he will have only himself to blame if it becomes necessary to touch the subsidy ; but it should be made perfectly clear to him that tha Govern ment of India will not hesitate to effect the recovery of the sums due in the manner proposed, should he attempt any further evasion of his obligations.

ZL Cox, C.KE., His Britannic Majesty's Consul and Political Agent, Maskat, To The Under-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer you to the correspondence ending with my letter No. 519, dated 12th October 1900, on the subject of the disposal of the arrears of subsidy which Government decided to refund to the Sultan. 2. When the said arrears, amounting to 3*72,000, were paid to His High ness, the balance still due from him on account of indemnity due to British subjects who suffered loss during the attack on Maskat of 1895, namely, 1127,026, was taken from His Highness and paid to the claimants. The usual notices were issued intimatins: final settlement of claims and calling upon claimants to appear for their balances, and during the ensuing nine months all persons who could be traced had been settled up with. At the srime time everv effort was made by inquiry from old residents, and from persons coming for their balances, to trace persons not forthcoming. 3. On 11th July 1901 claimants having long since ceased to appear, a notice was issued, publishing the names of all those who had not yet come for their balances, and intimating that, if they did not do so in person or by authorised agent by or before 11th October 1901 (by which time a year would have expired), no claims would be afterwards considered. This notice only resulted in two more persons being traced and paid through authorised agents, and this some time after the expiry of the notified period. Since then the unclaimed balance has been lying at this Consulate. As more than two years have now elapsed since (in October 1900) inti mation of final settlement was made, it must be presumed, as in some instances is known to be the case, that the parties concerned have either died or disappeared. 4). Sixteen names still remain on the list, the total of the several balances standing against which amount to dollars 972, 5. I have the honour to request the instructions of Government as to whether I should now refund this amount to His Highness the Sultan or credit it to Government. A copy of this lettelr is being forwarded to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, but I address this direct owing to the imminent close of the financial year.
