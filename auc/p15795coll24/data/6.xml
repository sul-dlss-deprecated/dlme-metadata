Abdel Sattar offers a portrait of Qurna, describing the houses as well as the lack of clean water, electricity, and nearby schools. He discusses localsâ€™ belief in the supernatural, relations among residents and the security of life on the hillside, and the role of sheikhs in resolving problems between people; Abdel Sattar explains that he was named after a prominent sheikh after the death of a number of male relatives. He speaks about residents depending on the ancient sites for their work in tourism and for digging for pharaonic artifacts, something for which they could be arrested. Abdel Sattar addresses the unpopularity of the displacement from the hillside with residents, especially those who worked in tourism.  While he observes that community spirit and security were better in Qurna, where life was less expensive and homes larger, he indicates that living standards are better in the resettled areas.         </dc:description><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:coverage>Al Qurnah, Egypt</dc:coverage><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>Qurna Hillside Oral History Project; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
