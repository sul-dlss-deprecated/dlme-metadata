(Received under British Embassy Bagdad Printed Letter Ho.360/1/40 of the 15th April 1940). (360/V 4 0)* EG. 164 . Confide ntial . British Embassy, Bagdad. 15th April, 1940. My Lord, sv* 3 l have the honour to refer to my despatch ^0.335 of July 1st, 1939, concerning the demareation of the Kuv/ait- Iraq frontier and to offer the following further observations on thi s subj e ct• in that despatch were put forv/ard in response to Your Lordship's instructions to endeavour to arrange with the Irao A i Government for the early demarcation of the frontier between Kuwait and Iraq and that those instructions were issued as the result of recommendations made by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that the demarcation of the frontier was desirable in order to check the frontier incidents which .ere at that time disturbing good relations between the two countries • 3. When that despatch was written no important British interests ¥/ere involved and in submitting tentative suggestions for the interpretation of ambiguities contained in the existing description of the frontier i was interested firstly to bring to notice the several difficult points that v/ould have to be cleared up before a demarcation com mission could begin to work, and secondly to suggest for this purpose formulae v /hich might reasonably and fairly be recommended to both Kuwait and Iraq.. Since then the progress made with the plan for the creation of an Iraqi port at Um Qasr has raised xtuestions directly concerning 9 It will be remembered that the proposals contained / the The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G. f G .G .S.I.,G.C.I .E etc., etc., e etc.-2- the intereets of His Majesty's Government and the difficulty of deciding what interpretations should he given to the descri; tion of the frontier laid down by Sir Percy Cox in 1923 has in consequence been increased. 4. Many aspects of the whole question of demarcation in relation to, the U id Q^asr port scheme were discussed in a letter from the Foreign Office to the Admiralty last August a copy of which was enclosed in Mr.laggallay*s letter to me ^o 6459/38/93 of September 19th, 19 39. The two outstanding features appear to me to be, firstly, that a wide latitude is possible in the permissible interpretation of the existing description of the frontier and, secondly, that the exact manner in which the frontier is finally demarcated has acquired great importance in view of the Um Qasr port project and of the potential oil resources of the whole area# As earlier correspondence has shown it seems possible to place the frontier ''just south of the latitude of Safwan w anywhere from a yard up to a mile to the south of whatever point may be fixed as being the southern limit of Safwan wells; a similar latitude is possible in deciding upon the manner in which the line is then continued, and also in fixing the ^junction of the Ehor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah 11 which may be taken as the intersection of the deepest channel Y/ith the deepest channel of the Khor Bubiyan or as the intersection of the respective median lines, or be fixed in some other manner without reference to the comparatively small Khfcr Bubiyan at all. 5* Of course before any given interpretation of the boundary line can be implemented by demarcation it must be accex^ted by both Kuwait and Iraq but it seems clear that the / initiative.3. Q 3 initiative in bringing about the demarcation will have to be taken by His Majesty 1 s GoverniDent and that the inter pretation proposed by His Majesty f s Government when taking this initiative is likely within certain limits to have considerable influence over both Iraq, and Kuwait. The effect which a final choice of a line could have on the Urn ^asr scheme is apparent from a study of the map and of Sir John Ward 1 a reports. Sir John favours a site for the port just below Urn Q,asr Greek and whether this site is in Kuwaiti or Iraqi territory depends on the manner in which the description of the frontier is interpreted. : ore over the important question of control of the approaches will also be influenced by the way in which the line is brought to, and continued from, the junction of the Khor Zubair v/ith Khor Abdullah. According to the chart which i enclose herewith i would however point out that the Khor Zubair is only that part of the Khor which extends inland from the creek to the west known as Um Casr Greek. Below that creek the name given on the enclosed chart is Khor Um Qasr. Horth of farba Island the Khor Abdullah is also described as the Khor She tana. According to the above description on the enclosed chart the frontier point here would therefore be at the junction of the Khor Shetana with the Khor Urn Qasr. 6. One interest which His ITajesty 1 s Government might have in preventing the Iraqi Government from constructing a port at Um Q^asr would be to ward off eventual encroachments on, or attempts to dominate, Kuwait. But the maintenance of an obstructive attitude on such a ground would no doubt be resented in Iraq and might well have unfortunate political! results in the long run. Another interest may be the protection of the British capital invested in Basra, but ^ / this-4- this again would hardly justify strong opposition to the development of an alternative porU utherv/ise on general grounds political, coimnercial and strategic it would seem to be desirable that this additional means of access to Iraq by sea should be developed, and that therefore the frontier should not be drawn in such a manner as to discourage Iraq from creating a port at all or so as to give rise to permanent friction between Iraq, and Kuwait. Subject to these latter considerations British interests presumably coincide more closely with those of Kuwait rathar than of Iraq, seeing that Kuwait is for all political purposes under British protection whereas Iraq is independent, in the present circumstances of our relation with both countries, every concession made to Iraq at the cost of Kuwait is a loss to ourselves unless it directly entails a compensating gain to our own special interests in Iraq* ?• In conclusion therefore 1 suggest that His Majesty^ Government should decide without further delay what are in fact the possible variations of interpretation which may reasonably be given to the accepted description of the frontier, in particular is it possible, firstly, to assign Urn Qasr Creek,i.e. the creek west of the main Khor at Um Q,asr either to iraq or to Kuwait ? Secondly, is it possible to assign a part of the Khor um Q^asr ^or Jts.hor Zubair) below Um ftasr either to iraq or to Kuwait ? Thirdly, could it be divided between them by making the deepest navigable channel (or the median line) the frontier from a point east of Um (iaar to the junction of the Khor Um ^asr with the Khor She tana t 8# Having decided on the limits of interpretation it will be desirable to decide on the particular interpretation, or / set(f) -5- set of interpretations, which seems best to suit British interests. Only then shall we have made the necessary- preparations for approaching the Governments of iraq and Kuwait with the most suitable initial suggestions. If we let the matter drift we may lose some of our ability to influence the eventual frontier at points of crucial importance* 9 # 1 am sanding copies of this despatch to the Political Resident in the Persian c*ulf at Bushire and to the Jeolitical Agent at Kuwait# I have the honour to be with the highest respect, My Lord, Your Lordship^ most obedient, humble servant, sd.

Copies af these telegrams have already been sent to you and to the other interested Departments. 2. The Secretary of State fully endorses the Government ? ■ /yv? ( &lt; • '* ■■ ■ » of India s view that it is important for our position in the Gulf that Koweit should be stable and free from Iraqi influence. Having regard moreover to the nature of our relations with the Sheikh and to the undertakings given to Sheikh Mubarak in 1914, it is in Lord Zetland r s view axiomatic that no pressure should be put on the Sheikh to cede any of his rights to the IraqiGovernment. Apart from these considerations it is necessary, as the Political Resident and the Government of India suggest, to take account of the attitude of Ibn Saud who is likely to regard with misgiving any extension of Iraqi influence in Koweit. i'he Under Secretary of State, OOPY SENT BY AIR MAit, oreign Office, OOPY SENT BY AIR MAIl. of lfo ^ o»W»JLt Q •' ' — ' Of ^3 u . u o &gt;PY SENT BY MAIL of 2 l *4 ' we t». .&amp; 1 3 • As the result of the informal approach made 'by the Political Resident to the Sheikh, it is clear that the latter would he opposed to making any territorial concession to Iraq, if approached in the matter, and that though he could not object if the project were'to he kept entirely in Iraqi territory, he would not welcome the scheme owing to the possihility of its affecting detrimentally the interests of Koweit. In view of the Sheikh s attitude and in the light of the considerations mentioned in the previous paragraph, Lord Zetland would suggest that the Iraqi G-overnment should he informed that until they can put forward a definite scheme which would indicate more precisely the nature of the concessions which they think it essential to obtain from the Sheikh and of the compensation which they would he prepared to offer him in return. His Majesty T s Government cannot offer any considered opinion on the matter. It should he explained at the same time that His Majesty's Government understand that it is improbable that the Sheikh will in fact be prepared to make any territorial concession in this area, and that in view of their engagements to the Sheikh they could not put any pressure upon him to do so. The Iraqi Government may therefore think it preferable either to proceed with a scheme which wOuld locate the proposed port in Iraqi territory and would not involve the cession by the Sheikh of any of his rights in the waterway or, as already suggested by His Majesty's Ambassador, to work out a project which would provide for Koweit a common interest with Iraq in the construction and development of a new port. 4. whatever the eventual decision as to the scope and nature of the new port. Lord Zetland would see considerableC9 ^ 3. advantage, before the project is further pursued, in the recommendation made by the Political Resident that 3ir John ward's proposals, which have apparently been made known by the latter in unofficial quarters, should be examined by the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, or, failing him, by a harbour engineer, and he would commend the suggestion to Lord Halifax r s consideration. He would also once more draw attention to the desirability of proceeding with the proposed demarcation of the frontier between Iraq and Koweit without delay since, should the Iraqi Government decide to confine the scheme for a new port to Iraqi territory, the precise position of the boundary line in the neighbourhood of Umm Qasr may be of considerable importance# 5» Copies of this letter are being sent to the Admiralty, war Office, Air Ministry, Colonial Office, Board of Trade, Ministry of Shipping, Petroleum Department and Offices of the War Cabinet.

He concurs generally in the terms of the draft telegram proposed to be sent to His Majesty ! s Ambassador at Bagdad but would suggest that after the words 'so that the proposed port must be situated on Iraqi territory 51 in the opening sentence there should be added the words 'and must not involve the cession by the Sheikh of any of his territory or rights in the waterway'. It seems desirable to make this addition since the Iraqis might otherwise point out that it has always been contemplated in the scheme under discussion that the port itself would be located in Iraqi territory* What the Iraqis have asked is that they should be given concessions by the Sheikh for the purpose of safeguarding the approaches to the port* Copies of this letter are being sent to the Departments named in paragraph 6 of your letter* I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sgd.)

In view of this assurance, and indeed on general grounds, it seems clear to Lord Halifax that if it is in . thought that additional port facilities in raq are re aired in the interest of His Majesty's Government, some part at least of the cost will have to be horne by His Majesty's Government^ 4# As Lord Zetland will be aware, a reconnaissance party has recently visited Basra in order to review the existing Uyig facilities there in relation to possible requirements in the future* In the course of their enquiries this party also nder Secretary of State, India Office. visited/visited the si.te of the proposed port on the Khor Ahdullah.

Iraq Government took line last March that frontier demarcation should be postponed pending solution of smuggling question and of their wish that Shaikh of Kuwait should cede some of his territory to Iraq, to secure Iraq control of approaches to new port. As regards smuggling we have seen no recent reports showing that this is still thought to be taking place on a large scale.

Government of India were not consulted before military decision was taken to develop emergency port at Um •^asr.

The difficulty of political problems which development of Um ^asr involves must therefore be faced. Subject to any comments v/hich Political Resident may have to make we consider it necessary at once to afford Shaikh of Kuwait unqualified assurances that whatever port development there may be at Um ^asr we v/ill permit no resurrection of Iraqi demands or ?suggestion of cessionjpf territory. We fc CTT^ cannot afford to compromise any (grau p omi.ttPd^ relating to Kuwait sover/eignty and are inclined to advise therefore that Kuwait's should be still further safeguarded by the / definite-2- w 0 dafinite statement being made now that all harbour installation railway approaches and so on located at Um u asr are British military property and failing an agreement between the British GoTernment, Iraq and Kuwait will be removed at the end of the war. We realise that this recommendation runs counter to the suggestion made at the end of paragraph 1 of Bagdad telegram Ho 747 but we trust the understanding already reached with Iraqi Government in regard to the maintenance of British troops in Iraq will render it unnecessary to proceed with Cornwallis* suggestion. 4.

It will simplify matter greatly if port is constructed notth c' Um 0 asr oreek. If however port were constructed artly in Kuwait territory and partly in Iram only practical solution would be joint harbour board under our ae-^is on which Ira^L and Kuwait were both represented. It is ,robable that this may prove to be the port for Kuwait f s oil in which case ,it is more than ever necessary that- her position should be fully protested. 3. I do not anticipate that Shaikh of Kuwait would raise any difficulties to development of port at town of Kuwait itself provided we reassure hi that his sovereignty will not be infringed.

Very careful enquiries from selected reliable Bedouin and other confidential soifces as well as from personal observation over a period of many months ^quite apart from any information furnished by ruler) have convinced me that smuggling situation today is even more favorable than reported by Galloway in his telegram 0/217 April 23rd. This is due to (a) better realization by Shaikh that it is vital in his interests today to do all in his power to stop smuggling into Iraq, in order to give no handle to Baghdad politicians to accuse him of conniving or at least winking at same, (b) Absence of grazing over whole Kuwait State which has compelled all camels (best form of transport for smuggling) to migrate far South into Hejd. (c) Greater prosperity of Kuwait merchants due to present flourishing trade with Arabia. Above does not refer to arms traffic which has ceased to exist. It is true with breakdown of civil administration following on British occupation of Basra when all Iraqi desert police posts including Safwan were abandoned, many Iraqis took advantage of situation and in the guise of (mut.) refugees came down to Kuwait in cars and did a roaring trade /goodsdp - 2 - goods to Zubair and Basra but this was isolated case and with return of control their activities ceased, 3* Estimated value of goods imported into Iraq, today less than Rs. 1,000/- per raensem. - POLITICAL - (Copy sent to 1.0. f O,of I.and Amb.Bagdad under P.li.No.C/324 d: 30.7 .41.)53/87 3 1-3 -p cr» OJ A o rCJ • a&gt; 0» &gt; •H (J&gt; tu co o © • ^ o r. ^ CI • O O tH • -P M •H +» ^ &lt;u (U &lt;U S4 « 3 Telegram •S' From India Office, I^ndon^ To JPolitical Resident at Shiraz.

He raised the question of TT mm Qasr and explained with considerable vigour that he had flown over the area and convinced himself and., so he claimed. Galloway that the site of the new port was wholly in Iraq, territory. I found that I was not required to make any contribution to the conversation. Ward ended hy assuring me of his cooperation in every way. 2. I inferred from remarks made 'by Martin, the Chief Engineer in Iraq., who was here yesterday that Ward had opposed the development of Kuwait which was from Martin's point of view a better proposition in some ways than Umm Qasr as the approaches are less obstructed. In Martin's opinion Ward is much afraid of the Shatt entrance silting up and he wishes to have an alternative outlet for IraqJL produce ready for ijnmediate use. I see from the files that Ward has 'been interested in the Umm Qasr and similar projects for some years. 3. Martin and I examined a map of the Umm Qasr areas as I wished to find out from him exactly where they were at the moment driving experimental piles, and the place he pointed out is south of Umm Qasr fort and seems to be almost completely within Kuwait limits.

Also according to their calculations southern 'boundary of port is nearly 3 miles south of Om Qasr as it 1 is at present shown on map. Kickihbotham considers site is partly in Kuwait territory. ^ 2. It is clear that the definition proposed in Ambassador Bagdad's letter Ho.487 of 7th October 1940 to Minister for foreign Affairs represented a concession to Iraq (since it drew a line from a point south of Safwan to the junction of the Khor Zubair and Khor Abdullah and not from 'just south of Um Qasr' to the Khor Junction) and as the Iraq Government did not accept the proposed definition the Shaikh is presumably no longer bound by it. Sir Percy Gox f s definition was admittedly based /J-^r 'based on Article 7 of the Anglo-Ottorrian Convention of 29th July 1913 and by that the most easterly points are (a) the mouth of the Khar Zubair and (h) a point 'immediately south of the place and wells of Urn qasr*. If this is shown to be more beneficial to Kuwait the Shaikh would appear entitled to claim it. 3. I suggest that railway surveyors (who are presumably Royal Engineers) be asked to give us an author itative map of disputed points so that we can see actual position and proposed definitions could then be amended if necessary as was contemplated in paragraph 8 of Hewton f s despatch Ho.164 of April 15th 1940 to Foreign Office. A joint harbour board is clearly most favourable to our interests and will be most easily secured if a portion of the site is found to lie in Kuwait territory. It would of course be open to the Iraq Government to move the port further north (if this were practicable) but this would not evade necessity of using Kuwait territorial waters and once they conceded Joint harbour board they would be unlikely to make alterations# It is essential that they should be warned in advance that they will not be allowed unrestricted control of port now being con structed as otherwise they will certainly create difficulties when port is handed over. 4.

Allum of the Hallway Construction Oonrpany who Is In charge of the survey from Umm Qasr to Kuwait came to see me today, OctolDer 5th, and told me that he has just had to re- survey the piece of line running Into the new port area at Uium Qasr so as to 'bring It In from the north and not from the south apparently to avoid any possibility of It entering Kuwait territory. He also informed me that ¥yse, the Officer Oommanding his Company, had Instructed him to put in the Kuwait - Iraq, 'boundary on the survey plan. This he said he was unahle to do as it had never 'been demarcated whereupon his instructions were to put in the 'boundary as shown on the i of an inch map. I gathered from his conver sation that the military authorities are particularly anxious for there to 'be no doubt which side of the port the frontier lies. 2. The port is supposed to 'be for purely military purposes and as the military authorities have been given complete freedom of movement in Kuwait territory and terri torial waters, it should 'be a matter of no particular interest to them whether it is wholly or partly in Kuwait or Iraq, territory. This curious interest 1 is in my opinion disqiuleting and although I have tried to keep an open mind on the question of Kuwait - Iraq, relations I find myself wondering if there is not some ulterior motive in the^ atten tion that is 'being paid to the siting of a port the position of which should be decided entirely by tactical and strate gical considerations.

Q LOCATION OF THE PROPOSED PORT AT UM QASR. The proposition is to establish the position of the proposed port at Urn Qasr in relation to the Koweiti-Iraqi frontier which has been defined roughly but not demarcated on the ground. 2. The section of the frontier which is relevant to the proposition is that between Safwan and the Khor Abdulla. The definition, made by Sir P.Z.Cox, states that the frontier should pass just south of Safwan to the junction of the Khor Zobier and the Khor Abdulla. I am not in possession of the words of the actual definition, but have been provided with the Iraqi Governments proposal of 1932, which is based on the above definition. This states 'just south of the latitude of SAFWAN: thence Eastwards passing south of SAFWAN WELLS, JEBEL SANA! and UM QASR, leaving them to Iraq, and so on to the junction of the KHOR ZOBEIR with the KHOR ABDULLA 11 . Even if this wording is not identical with the above-mentipned definition made by Sir P.Z.Cox, the essential points are the same, that the frontier in this area is a line from just south of Safwan to the junction of the Khor Zobier and the Khor Abdulla. It is therefore necessary to decide upon the location of (x) 'just' south of Safwan, and (y) the junction of the two Khors. 3. As regards x, it has, to the best of my recollection, been agreed by both the Iraqi and Koweiti authorities, that this point should be taken as one mile south of Safwan, and I think any boundary commission will in all probability accept the one mile proposal, so that point may be accepted, i.e. one mile south of Safwan Post. Even should this not be accepted, but Safwan Post itself selected as the frontier mark, it will not affect the present proposition, as a glance at the map will show. As regards y, in locating this point, the naming to be found on the various maps of the regioncannot be taken as a guide, for different names are found to indicate the same place on different maps. We therefore cannot rely on maps for evidence in this matter, and as we do not know the point that was in Sir P.Z.Cox 's mind, we must investigate possible positions of the junction. The arguments for possible positions follow, and shew that there are two logical positions. 4. There are four possible positions of the junction A. Opposite the Um Qasr Creek B. To the East of Warba Island .e Khor Zobeir • C. * Where the Khor Sabiyah joins the East-West channel. D. The confluence of the Khor which flows North- South with that which flows East-West. A. In my opinion, the logical meaning of the term Khor Zobier is that Khor which flows roughly North-South the mouth of which lies roughly between pillars Kand L on the attached map, that is to say, where the main North-South channel is met by the East—Y/est channel. Any other reading based on information from maps would be hard to defend, for although the term Khor Abdulla is found on some maps to indicate the southern reach of the Khor Zobier, this cannot be correct, for on these selfsame maps the wording Khor Shaitana is found for the northern arm of the Khor Abdulla at the bifurcation at Warba Island, and the Khor Bubiyan for the southern arm, this would indicate that the Khor Abdulla terminates East of Warba, Again, the southern re?ch of the Khor Zobier to the West of Hecham Island is known as the Um Q'asr Reach and tto the East as the/Chor Hecham. There are, therefore, no grounds for establishing the termination of the Khor Abdulla north of Hecham. B. It would be illogical to assume that the Khor Abdulla terminates to the East of Warba Island on the grounds- 3 - that on maps the terms Khor^ Shaitana and Khor Bubiyan are used. These are mere reaches of the main stream. If this is not taken ]■ to be the case, the Khor Abdulla and the Khor Zobier do not meet, i The only logical meaning of the term Khor Abdulla is that Khor which flows from the sea to the mainland westward. C» A possible solution for the position of the mouth of the Khor Zobier is where the Khor Sabiyah meets the main channel. It is not necessary here'to discuss this possibility, . for even were it selected by a frontier commission as the junction of the Khor Zobier and Khor Abdulla, the frontier drawn from that point to Safwan would pass to the south of the site of the proposed port. D. Having shewn that the Khor which flows North-South is to be regarded as the Khor Zobier, and the Khor which flows East-Y/est the Khor Abdulla, the junction is where these two waters meet, that is to say, somewhere near the intersection of the lines KN andLM on the attached map. The location of the points x and y having been decided upon, it remains to plot them on to maps to find the solution of the problem. The site of the proposed port will not extend more than 3,500 feet to the south from pillar F. The map has been prepared by the Base Survey Section. Xhere are no local terms which can be taken as a guide for in this barren region there are no inhabitants. I have made both ground and air reconnaissances of the area and having come to the conclusions set forth above I am of the opinion that the site of the proposed port of Urn Qasr is in Iraq. Sd. C.Galloway 21/8/41£j 0 Extract of a letter dated ECth October 1941 from Gaptain Hickinbotham, Political Agent, Kuwait. x ^ x x x X x X x x ^roiD what I could gather from him things are none too happy to be able to in Basra where they are said to be expected/to handle eight thousand tons a day, I believe they can only deal with eight hundred at present and the Margil docks are littered with stuff they have no rolling stock to get away was here over the ¥v;eek end and he gave me similar information I wonft vouch for the figures quoted but the proportion between what they have got to do and what they can do is roughly correct I believe. assuming for one moment that they are only fifty per cent correct even I cannot under stand why they dont use this place. Orane facilites are limited in Margil and its criminal to lumber up the docks there with stuff that does not require cranes to discharge. They can handle three or four ships here at a time using barges on boats loaded by the steamers* own winches. The discharging at the shore end vdll be slow work until they xkuEslz improve the two piers at Shu^waikh but it can be done. They have made no progress on the extension to the Landing Company's pier although I sent them an estimate over a month ago. another aspect of the case is the liability of the Shatt to be closed by magnetic mines or other diabolical contrivances of the year of Cur Lord 1941, nothing could be easier than for aircraft to effectually close the port or so it seems to my technically uninstructed mind and the Khor Zubair is in no better case. Common sense suggests that facilites /facilities here should be developed to the maximun] extent even though it be only as an insurance policy. Much can be done though alongside unloading v^ould not be possible except with major works. Overside unloading to barges will not work when dealing with weighty and unwieldy stuff but why not leave that to Margil and bring the bags and boxes here ? I am writing a private letter because it is (a) none of my business and (b) if it was my information is not suf ficiently definite to form the basis of an official commun ication. Last week they ordered the railway survey people to return at once to Basra to do dock sidings. I am glad to say those instructions have been amended and only half of them have gone. Today seemed to think that the railway would be required in the immediate future. Its very puzzling. I confess I would like to see development here for you know the possibilities of the place as regards work, xxx xxmm^l. New Delhi,the 3rd Novr. 1941.

His Majesty's Government think it desirable that the proposed notes should include agraemci.-t on the interpretation of certain |&gt;olnts in the wording of the definition of the frontier as re-affirmed by the Minister in his letter to the High CommiSBioner Fo. ?3hh of 21st ruly, 1932. ^ J(ro 3. In that letter the definition of the frontiers was re-affirmed in the following terms 'From the intersection of the ,odi Al Audja with the Batin and thence northwards along the Batin to a point just south of the latitude of jafwan; thence eastwards passing south of Safwan wells, Jebel senam and Urn Qasr leaving them to Iraq and eo on to the junction of the Khor coheir with t^e ihor Abdullah.

(2)The 'point just south of the latitude of Safwan' shall be the point on the thalweg of the Batin due West of the point a little to the 3outh of Safwsn at which the post and notice-board marking the frontier stood until March. 1939.

I have had a talk with Noyes, who tells me that things are by no means as bad at Basra as Hickinbotham has been told, though there is a pretty considerable block there owing mainly to the railway bottleneck. The trouble about Kuwait is that to make full use of it Involves laying an extra 100 or so miles of railway and the rails simply do not exist. Nothing would please Q.M.Q. better than to lay a line from Kuwait up to Shalbah, but there are dozens of other projects which have been given priority by H.M.G. Nevertheless Kuwait will be developed as a lighterage port for use when motor transport can be made available. I think it is by no means unlikely that a request will come before very long for Hickinbotham's assistance in getting the Kuwait Oil Company to lay a sand-and-oil track (of the Bahrain type) in order to cope with future heavy lorry traffic. If so, Hickinbotham will no doubt do his best to get ScottScott moving In the matter. 5. The main thing Is that Kuwait has certainly not been forgotten and It Is merely a matter of securing the necessary transport facilities In order to be able to make use of the port. How long It will be before these become available remains to be seen and depends, as you will realise, on factors which are barely, If at all, under control. Perhaps you will show this letter to Hlcklnbotham. Yours s-tncere-iy. The Hon'ble Lt. Col.

If this interpreta -v tion is accepted 'by His Majesty's Government, the expanded definition of 1940 (Annexure, Serial Bo. IX) will have to 'be abandoned, or at least modified to a substantial degree. Only thus will it he possible to secure for ' * X Kuwait, when the Kuwait-Iraq, frontier is demarcated, the recognition of rights whose maintenance and preservation are an obligation, self-assumed yet sacred, of the British Government. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Major, Political Agent, Kuwait./ 3. I (Q Hote of ths Safwan-Khor A'bdulla&gt;i section {\iO) of the Kuwait Iraq grontier &lt; ITovem'ber 1941 « ******* !• i'he Northern boundary of Kuwait has been an object of discussion, and often of dispute, for forty years, and no one, without compelling reasons, would be justified in adding to the volume of literature, already considerable, which has grown up around the subject# But there is, at the present moment, imminent danger of steps being taken which would result in the loss to the Shaikh of Kuwait of valuable territorial rights - rights, moreover, which His Majesty^ Government are pledged to protect^ and it is, therefore, of importance that there should be no misapprehension in regard to the nature and extent of those rights if they are to become the subject of further negotiations with the iraq Government* \p 0 iw Z» The latest definition of the Northern boundary of Kuwait is contained in letter 140 o 487, dated 7th October 1940 from His Majesty^ Ambassador at Bagdad to the Minister for foreign Affairs, Iraq Government ~ vide serial Ho#IX in the Annexure to this note. That definition purports to be, and is propounded as, an interpretation of the defini tion accepted both by the Iraq Government and H#H»the Shaikh of Kuwait in 1932 ivide serial jNo.VIII annexure). The definition of 1932 is identical with the definition agreed to in 1923 by the High Commissioner for Iraq iSir ^ r-. n c Percy Cox) and H,H. the Shaikh of Kuwait (vide serial &amp;o« ¥11 Annexure), And the definition of 1923 was specifically stated by Sir Percy Oox to be 'identical with the frontier indicated by the Green line of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of July 29th, I9i3«.-2« 3* It would thus be IDgioal to expect that the expanded ii&gt;o definition of the boundary line proposed to the iraci Government in October, 1940, would correspond exactly with the frpntier ^ s tu&gt; ^ ^ ^ ^ ' * :A ' r I indicated by the Green Line of the Anglo~Turkiah Agreement of 1913« Unfortunately there is no such exact correspondence; and, still more unfortunately, the divergence occurs at the very point (i.e. in the vicinity of 13m ^asr) where exact correspondence would, in present circumstances, be most welcome• 4# It will readily be seen where the divergence occurs# In the map attached to the Anglo-Turkish Agreement the Green Line runs E.S.E. from Safwan to Um &lt;iasr, and thence S.E, following, apparently, the line of the lihor. It is here relevant to bring to notice a number of errors in the drawing of the map. ia) The line denoting the Eastern bank of Khor Zubair becomes, below Um ^asr, the western bank of the ^-hor as Subiyehs which is absurd, (b) By a complementary error the shading to indicate water is, below urn Q^asr, misplaced. (c) The Green Line below Dm Q,asr does not merely join the Red Line,but extends beyond it; this also is absurd. But these cartographical errors, however much they may add to the difficulties inherent in detailed interpretation of the Green Line, do not affect the simple fact that the Green Line does, south of Um ^asr, take a direction different from that which it takes between Safwan and Um Q,asr. Whereas, in the inter- ^1/iO pretation suggested to the Iraq Government in 1940, the boundary is «in a straight line from the neighbourhood of Safwan to the junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah' * y 5. A report prepared recently by Lieut.-Colonel Galloway indicates tnat tlie site of tHe projected port at um ^asr will, / if. 3 . f if the expanded definition of 1940 is applied when the 'boundary is demarcated, fall within Iraq territory# On the other hand, if the implications of the Green Line are accepted and applied when the boundary is demarcated, the site of the port will fall mainly, and perhaps exclusiTely, within Kuwait territory. The issues involved in the inter pretation of the boundary as defined in the i^fjlo-Turkish Agreement of 1913 are, therefore, of weighty significance alike to Iraq and Kuwait; and it will be necessary, in order to appreciate the position fully, to scrutinise the origins -p /JO both of the expended definition of 1940 and of the Green Mne itself, 6. The expanded definition of 1940 has a comparatiTely brief history. In 1935 r in connection with the delineation I I ■ on Survey of India maps of the Kuwait - Iraq frontier, Uolonel Dickson then Political Agent, Kuwait,reported that the boundary ran n in a straight line** from a point one mile Paragraph 1 of 'Te'{Te'FTTg.'(J.'262 dats'd 27'^ to the south August, 1935, from Lieut•-Colonel H.B.P.Dick-) son, GIE,,Political Agent, Kuwait, to the ) of Safwan wells Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian) Gulf ♦ _ _ ^ - ' to 'kke junction of the Khor Zubair with the Khor Abdullah; and he suggested that the boundary should thus be traced on the Survey of India maps. His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad, to whom Colonel Dickson's suggestion was referred, deplored a Unilateral ^ 1 h t d j fc • Dl Paragraphs 6 'andT 7 of DespalcH'iJoTsTCl3^Y/ T interpretation 11 9/35 dated 30th October 1935 from HoM^s ; Ambassador, Bagdad, to the foreign Office» ) of the inter national documents in which the frontier was laid down, and expressed the view that, as the agreed frontier between Iraq and Kuwait was intended to be identical with the Green Line of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 1913, that Line ^should be most carefully reproduced** in all official maps on which / the-4- the frontier between Iraq and Kuwait was shown. His Majesty's GoTerntnent did not accept this view; and, in regard to that portion of the frontier which forms the subject of this note, they made the following observations s- * ?' / , l v , v *f Paragraph 6 of Despatch ■'o.TS ^7061/127/)'From Safwan to 91 dated 22nd January 1936 from Foreign ) Office to H^M.'s Ambassador, Bagdad. ) the Persian Gulf, His Majesty's Government see no reason to dissent from the frontier line which the ifolitical Agent at Kuwait has indicat ed as being locally accepted, namely, a straight line from a point one mile south of Safwan to the junction of the mior Zubair and the Khor Abdullah Tjiis line should be s drawn straight from a point a mile south of Safwan to the tri-junction of the Kbor Zubair, the Khor Shetana and the Khor as Subiya, since this point represents as nearly as possible the junction of the Khor Zubair and the Khor Abdullah. Careful examination of the results of the recent survey do not suggest to His Majesty's Government that any material point can be involved 11 # Delineation of the boundary on Survey of India maps was subsequently made in accordance with this interpretation which was not, at the time, referred either to the Iraq Government or to the Shaikh of Kuwait for their assent. 7. A proposal to demarcate the Kuwait - Iraq boundary brought this complex question once again into prominence; and, in June 1940, the assent of the Shaikh of Kuwait was sought to the expanded definition of the boundary to which reference has already been made ^vide serial i^o.lX Annexure). The expanded definition of the boundary was described to H.H. the Shaikh as being 'only a clarification of the exist- ing definition'; and on this understand^'i.e. on the under- standing that no change in the status quo was involved, the ./ ShaikhShaikh gave hia fonaal assent to the new definition* The expanded definition has also been proposed to the lra&lt;i Govern ment as a basis for the interpretation of the agreed defini- !• Letter ^o,48T of^fTToT^O from Ambassador at Bagdad to the Iraqi Minister for foreign Affairs.

But in fact a straight line drawn as Colonel Dickson suggested passes very much more than one mile to the south of Um %asr, and corresponds in no way with the Green Line of the Anglo-Turkish Agreementi to which Colonel Dickson seems at no time to have referred. Colonel Dickson's suggestion, which V;.-' / f ^ O formed the nucleus of the expanded definition of 1940, was therefore based on a misapprehension which has only now become apparent. ■ /-6- 0 (b) The aasent of His Majesty's Govermnent to Colonel Dickson's suggestion was accorded in the 'belief that ^no material point* was thereby involved. At the time when assent was given that belief was justified; but now, in view of the facts stated in paragraph 5 of this note, a point of the great est material importance has become involved# (c) The expanded definition was accepted by H.H.the Shaikh of Kuwait on the understanding that it constituted merely a re-affirmation, in more detailed forp, of the existing boundary, if the expanded definition involves a divergence from the existing boundary (i.e. the boundary intended to be delineated by the Green idne), the Shaikh's assent is obviously void • (d) The Iraq Government have neither accepted nor reject ed the expanded definition proposed to them. But it is of interest, and may be of importance, to note that the Iraq Government have not been informed of the Shaikh of Kuwaiti acceptance of the expanded definition# Un the contrary, they were informed by H.M.'s Ambassador at .Bagdad in the concluding h ~ • ■ ''&amp;■ paragraph of iiis letter of 7th October 1940, that, if they on their part agreed to the proposals made to them, he would 'endeavour to obtain, through the proper channel, the formal agreement of His Highness the Ruler of iluwait n « The Shaikh of Kuwait is not, therefore, vis a vis the Iraq Government, committed to acceptance of the expanded definition. 9. To appreciate the significance of the Breen Line it is necessary to review the circumstances in which it was devised, in 1911 it was decided by His Majesty's Government that, as part of an arrangement for British participation in the Bagdad railway, the time had come to discuss with the Turkish Govern ment a settlement of the Kuwait question. After a preliminary exchange of notes Hia Majesty's Government addressed to the / Ottoman■ : I -7- &gt;..%&gt;! ' •0^ Ottoman GoTerrmient on July istli 1912 a detailed Memorandum* IP' ^ Annex 4 to that Memorandum contains a description of tne Kuwait-Turkish frontier as rt a line running from Khor as Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of limm ,%aar and Safwan to Jebel Sanam (vide Annaxurs to this note, serial Ho.II). T &amp;ia description is identical with the description of Kuwait's northern boundary given in Loriraer's Gazetteer, Vol. 11, p.1060 ivide annexure, serial J^o.l). in other words - and this is a point of primary importance - effect was being given to the decision reached by His Majesty's Government at an earlier date that ,, our obligations extend to the whole of the Shaikh's territory as described in Lorirner's Gazetteer 11 (vide india Office letter dated 30th October 1911 to foreign Office). I— * 10. That the definition of the Kuwait boundary contained in Loriraer's Gazetteer was by no means acceptable to Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait is evident from contemporary correspondenee. The Shaikh claimed that Safwan and ura Q,asr (the latter place being the original home of the Shaikh's ancestors) were undoubtedly his; and Captain Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, in the 'Hote on the Boundaries of the Kuwait y ^ b' Principality 11 which formed an enclosure to his letter ho* 0 62 dated 12th August 1912 to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, gave the strong support of his expert knowledge to the Shaikh's claim. His Majesty's Government were not, however, prepared to make any substantial alteration to the definition of the Kuwait boundary which had already been proposed to the Turkish Government; and the definition of the frontier contained in Article 7 of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement ■ K. of 29th July 1913 (vide Annexure to this note, serial Ho. VI) is, if not identical in words, identical in substance with ^ 'L , It i Lorimer's description ^Annexure, serial iMo.i). / llo~8~ statenient that the defintion of the frontier contained in Article 7 of the Anglo-Turkiah Agreement of 29th July 1913 is identical in substance with Lorimer's description is the 'basis of arguments contained in a later part of this note; and it would therefore be as well to justify it at this stage. it has been shown (Tide para 9 above) that the defintion of the frontier contained in Annex 4 to the Memorandum of 18th July 1912 (annexure, serial J^o. II) was intended to be, and was in fact, identical with Lorimer* s defintion. intermediate between the defintion of 18th July 1912 and the definition finally adopted in the agreement of 29th July 1913 came three other defintions re- ixjli ^ produced as serial Bos.III, 17 and Y in the Annexure to this Mote. fhe defintion at serial Bo.Ill is specifically recorded as being a re-statement of the defintion contained in Annex 4 to the Memorandum of 18th July 1912 (serial i ^o.Il). But it will be noted that two verbal changes have occurred:- (a) The starting point of the line is recorded as being ^The coast at the mouth of the Khor-es-Zubair w instead of sifeply w Khor-as-Subiyah«; and (b) the line ^proceeds in a N.¥. direction up to and past the walls of the fort of Safwan 11 . The changes in serial J^os.IV and V are of minor import, but are recorded in the interests of completeness. In serial lo.IT the definition states that the line runs rt up to and past but not including the walls of the fort at Safwan», the three words underlined having been added to the definition at serial Mo. III. And in serial Ho.T the line runs ^up to and past but not including the walls of the forts at Um Q,asr and Safwan', the fort at Um Q.asr having been added to the defintion at serial Ho.IV. m serial No.VI, which constitutes the formal defintion of the Green Line, the starting point of the line is retained as 'the mouth of the Khor Zubair' but the line itself is /© V ■ -9- is defin|ed aa passing ,, iiDn)ediately to the south of \Jmm Q,asr and Safwan 11 (as in serial lios.I and II) rather than as ^up to and past •*•••• ..the walls of the forts at Umm ^asr and Safwan* 1 (as in serial Ho.Y). 12* it will not be disputed that, where the meaning or intention of the Green Line is ambiguous, that Line must be construed by reference to the defintion contained in Article 7 of the Agreement of 29th July 1913. And it is now clear that, where that defintion is itself ambiguous or obscure, elucidation must be sought, not in speculation based upon the results of surveys subsequent to 1913, but by reference to Lorimer's Gazetteer, which appears to have been, through out the negotiations with the Turkish Cjovernment up to July 1913, the sole documentary authority on which His Majesty's Government relied when defining the northern frontier of Kuwait. 13. There are, relevant to the subject matter of this note, two points in respect of which both the Green Line, as traced on the map accompanying the Agreement of July 1913, and the definition of that line included in the text of the Agreement, are ambiguous or obscure. The first of these points is the position of the boundary ^immediately to the south of Um C^asr and Safwan'. The second point relates to the location of the beginning of the boundary line w at the mouth of the Khor Zubair w . 14. Reference to Lorimer's Gazetteer (vide Annex- ure, serial ^o.I) and to the intermediate definitions of the boundary propounded from time to time by His Majesty's Government prior to July 1913 (vide Annexure 17.(* aerial i^os.II, III, IV and V) resolves any possible doubt /•10. doubt concerning the correct position of the Kuwait frontier vis a vis Um ^.asr and Safwan. Lorliner defines the boundary as passing ,, immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwan 11 - the actual words used in the formal definition of the boundary finally accepted on July 29th 1913 - and comments that H the influence of the Shaikh of Kuwait is unquestioned up to the very walls of those places 11 • The words 'up to the very walls of those places H are undoubtedly reflected in the words used in the suggested definitions reproduced at serial ^os.III, IY and V of the Annexure to this note; and there can be no doubt whatsoever that, at the time when the Green Line was agreed upon, the Kuwait frontier was understood to extend, in the words of Lorimer, 'up to the very walls 11 of Um Q,asr and Safwan. The examination of contemporary records thus shows conclusively that the term 'immediately to the south of um ^iasr and Safwan 11 can bear one inter pretation only: and that interpretation is one which, unfortunately, has not found a place in the most recent defintion of the boundary. 15. The second ambiguous point is the location of the commencement of the boundary line at 'the mouth of the Khor A /2~7 Zubait' (Annexure, serial iio.TI). This point, as has been demonstrated earlier in this note, should coincide with the commencement of the boundary line referred to by Lorimer txt as the 'Khor as Subiyeh' (Annexure, serial ^o.I). Where does the 'Khor as Sabiyeh end? Where does the 'Khor Zubair begin? Those are the questions which have proved so puzzling in recent years to persons who have tried to interpret the definition of the Green Line contained in the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 1913 without reference to the circumstances /. t iV c -11- circuio stances in which that definition was arrived at. The truth is, of course, that the defintion was composed with reference to the terms used in Lorimer's Gazetteer, and only by reference to the terras used in that Gazetteer can the definition be properly interpreted. 16. the following quotations are taken from Lorimer 1 Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Yol.II, pages 1503 - 1504: '^asr (Umm) . Properly a spot 7 miles above Warbah Island, on a prolongation northwards of the Abdullah and Subiyah Khors. For 6 miles above Warbah Island the inlet on which Umm Q,asr stands is on the average three-quarters of a mile broad and its depth varies from 6 to 9 fathoms; at 6 miles it divides into two brands, one of which runs for a short distance (perhaps 3 miles) north westwards, narrowing as it goes; while the other con tinues northwards in the direction of Basrah Mo where within Khor Umm ! %asr or Zubair is the navigation easy, for the channel is winding and the banks are sub merged and disappear at high tide. There is some doubt as to the true nomenclature of these waterways; but the main inlet for 6 miles above Warbah island appears to be known locally as Khor-ath- Tha^lab, the small branch running to the north-west as Khor umm Q,asr, and the large branch running to the north as Khor Zubair^ 17. There is no ambiguity in this description. Khor Zubair does not begin, according to Lorimer, at the junction of Khor Abdullah with Khor Subiyeh. It 'begins unequivocally, opposite Umm C^asr; and the stretch of water /12. water which runs south and east of the Junction of Khor ^ubair with Khor Umm ^asr for a distance of six miles is described as «a prolongation northwards of the Abdullah and SaMyah IQiors 11 (vide sketch map annexed, serial i^o. r i 1( a )). Ihe term'Khor Sabiyeh* used by Lorimer to denote the starting point of Kuwait f s northern boundary (serial J^o. 1) is somewhat vafeue. Probably the term v/as used to denote, not a point, but a line, i.e. the channel of the iihor Subiyeh i : south and east of the junction of ilhor Zubair with Khor Umm Q,asr. It was, presumably, because the term v/as not sufficient ly precise to denote the starting point of an international boundary that it was replaced, in definitions subseouent to / / s-3 that of 18th July i9l£ (serial Jsio.II), by the term 'the mouth of the Khor Zubair', a definition in regard to lav^ch there was, in 1913, no ambiguity whatsoever. The term 'mouth of the Khor ^ubair' denoted in 1913, precisely and without ambiguity, that point where the inlet forming the prolongation of Khors Abdullah and Sabiyeh bifurcated into two channels, the Khor Zubair and the Khor Umm Q^asr • i 8 • it sometimes happens, especially in cases affecting boundaries, that logical and precise interpretation of the words of a definition leads to a conclusion which, from a broader aspect, appears strainged and unnatnral. In this case, however, careful examination and logical interpretation of the terms used in 1913 to define Kuwait's northern frontier suggest, and indeed prove, a boundary line which, so far from being forced or artificial, demonstrably constitutes the nat- ural link between certain well defined points. ihat boundary line runs (using the nomenclature employed by Lorimer)from the junction of the thalweg of Hi or Abdullah with the thalweg of the Khor Sabiyeh along the thalweg of Khor-ath-Tha'alab to the junction of the thalweg of Khor Zubair with the thalweg of the Khor torn Ciasr; thence in a straight line to a point to the13. » i the south of, and iimnediately adjacent to, the walls of the fort at Uimri Q,asr; thence in a straight line to a point to the south of, and iiraiediately adjacent to, the walls of the fort at Safwan. (It is to be noted that the wells of Umm Q^asr and Safwan are to be leftjto the north of the boundary - vide Annexure, Serial I'o.VI. This condition does not affect the boundary line defined above since the wells at UmiD Q^asr are to the north of the Uimn ^asr fort and the wells at Safwan are to the west of the Safwan fort.AHTIBXUR5 , Serial No * I« Kuwait's northern boundary as described by Lorimer.

Equally problems of supply of and jurisdiction over labour will arise. 3* While we agree with Ambassador that we cannot now divert energies to frontier delimitation it is essential to set up practical arrangements which will not ultimately prejudice claims either of Iraq or Kuwait and will not antagonise either or both of them» Since there seems still to be some disagreement between British authorities in Bagdad and Persian Gulf as to correct align ment of frontier there might be difficulties even in framing a unilateral declaration of temporary validity enabling Iraq or Kuwait to exercise exclusive jurisdiction. On the other hand Bay 9 3 suggestion for administration by British authorities presumably means British military auth or ities/authorities in Iraq and there would be serious objection in imposing this further burden upon them. 4® Problem is therefore one of securing day to day administration without prejudice to boundary question and without provoking non-cocperation from either party* We can only advise that it should be discussed by Ambassad with Resident Persian Gulf and General Iraq with a view to seeking best practical temporary solution.

QEHRRAL . IjFor the purposes of this note it is assumed that the new port at Umm Qasr will 'be found to lie wholly within the 'boundaries of Iraq, when the frontier is demarcated. Fortunately for Kuwait this is an erroneous assumption as the site chosen for the port is without doubt in Kuwait territory and could only come within the confines of Iraq, as a result of political pressure 'being 'brought to 'bear on the Shaikh of Kuwait to cede territory to Iraq.. This point will he dealt with fully in the 'body of the note. J 2• The estahlisbment of a new port, equipped with the most modern machinery, at Umm Qasr will affect Kuwait 'both politically and commercially and I propose to deal separately with these two aspects of the question. Unfor tunately the commercial aspect can only 'be a matter of conjecture and deduction for so many^at present ^unknown factors affect the question. The political side is more easy to forecast for we have ample evidence of our policy in the past and there is no reason to suppose that it will vary to any appreciable extent in the future. / 3. The establishment of a modem port at which ships can 'berth alongside connected 'by rail with a major railroad system must have an adverse effect on an undevelop ed and 'backward harbour some seventy miles to the south at which over-side off-loading into 'barges must 'be done and where suMen and often prolonged storms render work imprac ticable causing delay and often financial loss to 'both shippers and steamship owners. Though the truth of this statement is o'bvious it is not easy to give concrete reasons in support of it- 2* ) If}) &amp;1 it 'because, providing that there are no changes in the existing steamer services and no lowering of customs tariffs, there does not seem to 'be any particular reason why the new port should have any effect at all on the old established one, 'but we are not entitled to assume that things will remain unchanged and. it is to the distant future U/t that om must look to determine the full effect of Umm Qasr on Kuwait. In normal times the B.I.S.IT. Company's ships call weekly at Kuwait and the ships of Messrs. 1?. Strick ana. Company monthly, while the vessels of various Japanese concerns call at irregular intervals and it is reasonable to assume that once IJmm Qasr port is established the ships of these Companies will go there,where they can berth alongside, for no commercial concern will waste time and money calling at an open road-stead when but a few miles away is a modern port^and the Kuwait merchants will be left to make the best arrangements that they can to clear their goods, or altematjfetply the freight rates to Kuwait will be increased to compensate shipping companies for loss of time in discharging. Thus commercial pressure will be brought to bear in favour of Umm Qasr and although pressure of this nature will not be particularly effective in regard to merchants who cater for the needs of the local popula tion for the very nature of their business will compel them to remain in Kuwait and to depend more and more on obtain- in^* supplies by dhow it will stop all large scale transit trade for the merchants in a large way of business who control export houses dealing with Saudi-Arabia will be forced to move their headquarters to the new port where they will be welcomed and where no far sighted authority would fail to grant attractive facilities. Umm Qasr is seventy miles further away from Saudi-Arabia than Kuwait and at one time this extra seventy miles was a seriouso'bstacle when camels were the principal means of transport 'but the day of the camel is over for more and more lorries are coming into use year 'by year and what at one time x represented three days journey will not now add more than three hours to the journey to Eiyadh. There is a further aspect of the commercial side of the question to 'be considered and that is the trade that Kuwait does with the Bedouin tribes. These tri'bes migrate in the summer to Kuwait's northern territory watering their animals at Safwan, Umm Qasr and neighoouring wells. At present they make their purchases in Kuwait 'but in future when Umm Qasr is so much closer they will not trouble to come to Kuwait for their summer wants and what is of greater importance their winter loads for Hejd will 'be purchased at Umm Qasr. PQUTI0A3XY , The establishment of an Iraqi port at Umm Q,asr on the site now chosen is impossilDle unless the Shaikh cedes territory to Iraq and this he will never do unless very strong pressure is 'brought to hear on him. Should the Shaikh cede territory to Iraq, his prestige will suffer and his relations with Ihn Saud will 'be strained for the King of the Hedjaz and Hejd does not view with too favoura hie an eye Iraqi encroachment on to the ^Island of the lArahs'. Even though the Shaikh, under duress, cedes the 1 ground on which the new port will stand he will not have satisfied the Iraqis for he will still own half of the Khor Abdullah and could thus exercise some control over the port and this would 'be very distasteful to them so that the next move will he to press for the ceding of Kuwait rights in this waterway, and so it will go on until the land on the right hank of the Khor Abdullah and Warba and Buhiyan Islands have all come under Iraq.control. Here one is not dealing with conjecture for such t demands have already 'been considered by the Iraq. Government and 'both here and in Bushire there is a not inconsiderable correspondence on this subject. It may he suggested that His Majesty's Government would never countenance pressure 'being put on the Shaikh of Kuwait to cede his territory 'but a perusal of the files in the Gulf Agencies with particular reference to the Date Gardens Case, the case of Shaikh Khazal of Mohammerah, and the suggestion with regard to Khor al Odeid the acknowledged property of the Shaikh of Abu DhaM, will convince the doubter that given the right circumstances everything is possible. These are lamentable stories and I regret that I see no reason to suppose that the future will tell any finer tale than the past. ;ijj Even now when we are in virtual occupation of Iraq, we are apparently unable to exert any very compelling pressure on the Government of that country in regard to the most insignificant of affaires for after seven months we have yet ||| to persuade them to permit the Indian Postal authorities in Rut, Kuwait to collect by land, at their own expense, Kuwait mails from the Basra Post office. Unless our conduct of affaires in that country undergoes a revolutionary change, and I see no reason to suppose that it will, is it reasonable to suppose ! that, once peace has been restored and our troops have been withdrawn and Iraq, is once again being encouraged in her curious experiments in self-government, we shall be capable of or even inclined to resist a determined effort by the Iraq. Government to acquire additional territory at the expense of a weak neighbour even though that neighbour enjoys our protection. No, I am afraid that Kuwait will be called upon to make sacrifices that can but result in the decline of the State&lt; &lt;v • Z/U/53/87. l£o Telegram: From: Tos Repeated S India Office, London, H.lPs Ambassador Baghdad.

' in the Persian Gulf, Camp BAHRAIN, 10th March 1942. ' /V O sir, With reference to my telegram No.T/77, dated the 3rd March 1942, I have the honour to state that since my discussions with His Majesty's Ambassador, Baghdad, on the subject of Umm Qasr and our visit to the spot I have further examined the records and have reached the conclusion that the northern frontier of Kuwait as defined in the Anglo-Turkish h T Agreement of 1913 and by Sir Percy Cox in his memorandum No. \f*l It-Si* A f 7 # 5045 dated the 19th April 1923 is neither the line described ^ fy by Sir Basil Newton in his letter No.487 of the 7th October 1940 to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Iraq Govern- ment nor the line described in Mr, Wakefield's note but some- thing in between. 2. The three main pronouncements on the subject prior h to the definition of 1940 are Lorimer^ description of Kuwait's northern boundary at page 1060 volume 2 of his Gazetteer of ^ 12-7 the Persian Gulf, Article 7 of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of WiJD-jra. A ij 1913 and Sir Percy Cox 1 definition in 1923 in his memorandum referred to above. Before I proceed to discuss these pro nouncements it is necessary to examine briefly the geography of the various creeks the nomenclature of which has given rise to so much confusion. For this purpose I invite a reference fn- / ax to Annexure Serial No. 1(A) to Wakefield's note a copy of which I attach. I propose to refer throughout this letter to the portion A - B in the sketch map given in this Annexure as Khor-ath-Tha' alab • This portion of the waterways is un fortunately nowhere given this name in any of the three pro nouncements and the point that is to be decided is whether for the purposes of the pronouncements it is to be regarded as part of the Khor Zubair, of the Khor Abdullah or of the Khor Sabiyeh. Majesty's Secretary of State for India, The India Office, London.' PfrS) - 2 - ' ■■■k I 3* Lorimer's description runs as follows 'We may consider the frontier to be a line running from Klior-as«»Sabiyeh so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwan to Jabal Sanam and thence to the Batin. 11 Lorimer in his description of Unun Qasr at pages 1503 - 1505 of Volume II of his Gazetteer refers to the 'prolongation northwards of the Abdullah and Sabiyeh Khors known locally as the Khor ath-Tha 1 alab'(J) Lorimer ^ des cription of the frontier is not very precise but my belief is that he regarded it as a straight line running from the edge of the waterway passing immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwan and that he referred to the Khor-ath-Tha^lab loosely as the Khor as Sabiyeh, . 4. The literal translation of Article 7 of the Anglo- Turkish Agreement of 29th July 1913 is as follows; 'The line of demarcation leaves the coast at the mouth of Khor Zubair towards the northwest and passes immediately to the south of Umm Qasr and Safwan and of Jabal Sanam so as to leave tnese places and their wells to the vilayet of Basra'. But for the map attached to the Agreement I should have regarded this line as coinciding with Lorimer's. The map however though on a very small scale and not very accurately drawn distinctly shows the line as leaving the coast at the southern extremity of the Khor-ath-Tha 1 alab and then running in a more or less north-Westerly direction to Umm Qasr where it takes a sharp bend towards Safwan. I now consider from this that for the p~urpose of this Agreement the southern extremity of the Khor- ath-Tha'alab was regarded as the mouth of the Khor Zubair and that the frontier defined is a line running from the right bank of the Khor-ath-Tha 1 alab at its southern extremity up practically to the walls of Umm Qasr and then turning westwards towards Safwan. I was formerly of opinion - vide paragraph 3 of my 5. nq letter No.lSl-S of 20th December 1941 that the portion of the A Green Line south of Umm Qasr was meant to follow the thalweg of the Khor-ath-Tha 1 alab but as in Article 7 of the Agreement the line is described as leaving the coast and no mention is made of—— • 3 - rtL, of any thalweg I find myself compelled to change my views. A study of the wording of Article 5 has contributed to this change as it is stated in it that the Khor Zubair is the northern extremity of a semi-circle shown in red on the map# The northern extremity in the semi-circle as shown on the map attached to the Agreement appears, as clearly as is possible in such a small scale and badly printed map, to coincide with the southern extremity of the Khor-ath-Tha^lab and the point of departure of the Green Line. 6. Sir Percy Cox in 1923 described the line as 'passing south of SafT^an wells, Jabal Sanam and Umm Qasr leaving them to Iraq and so on to the junction of the Khor Zubair and the Khor Abdullah'. The most up to date map available at the time shows this junction at the mouth of the Khor Umm Qasr, cf. the S So enclosure to my Printed Letter N0.I88 -S dated 21st December 1941. I have seen a larger scale edition of this map which is still regarded as the most accurate map of this area in the office of the General Officer Commanding at Basra in which the junction is similarly shown. I would also note here that both in the map accompanying Lorimer's Gazetteer and in the map attached to the Anglo-Turkish Agreement the 'Khor Zubair' is shown well to the north of the mouth of the Khor Umm Qasr as in the annexure to this letter. Sir Percy Cox however In his memorandum of the 19th April 1923 states that the line described by him is 'identical with the frontier indicated by the Green Line of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of July 29th, 1913'. In spite therefore of what is stated earlier in this paragraph I am inclined to think that Sir Percy Cox must have regarded the Khor-ath-Tha 1 alab as part of the Khor Zubair. He did not however intend his line to end at the tri-junction of the Khor-ath-Tha'alab Khor Sabiyeh and Abdullah but where the Anglo-Turkish Agreement makes it begin i.e. at the right bank of the southern extremity of the Khor-ath-Tha 1 alab and he also intended it to run from Saf?/an right up to Umm Qasr and to turn southwards from there as it does in the map attached to the Agreement. 6. When I visited the spot with His Majesty's Ambassadorr - 4 - ^ Ambassador on the 26th February the tide was very low and there was no water at all in the Khor Dmm Qasr which certainly made the Khor-ath-Tha 1 alab appear as part of the Khor Zubair. The muddy bed of the Khor Umm Qasr could however be seen extending inland for a distance of two or three miles. There is no doubt that had the water been higher a different impression would have been given. Further an R,E # officer on the spot stated that the Arabs habitually referred to the Khor-ath-Tha 1 alab as the Khor Abdullah and that they only referred to the waterway north of the mouth of the Umm Qasr creek as the Khor Zubair, 7. If however we are to take Article 7 of the Anglo- Turkish Agreement as our basis for the definition of the frontier which was clearly Sir Percy Cox's intention in 1923 the line will in my opinion run from the water's edge at the right bank of the Khor-ath-Tha'alab at its southern extremity up to a point immediately south of Umm Qasr fort, 'Immediately 11 is a vague term but it can be reasonably taken as indicating a distance not /I more than 100 yards. I would note that the total distance from the water's edge at the right bank of the mouth of the Khor-ath- Tha'alab to Umm Qasr fort is so far as can be judged not less than two miles. This line will run very close along the right bank of the Khor-ath-Tha'alab and will leave little else than the actual ships' berths in Iraq territory, 8, The above are my personal views. I feel satisfied that on any reading of the various pronouncements the 1940 definition is too favourable to Iraq and as it has not been accepted by the Iraq Government I strongly recommend that it should be regarded as abrogated. It is true that the effect of accepting the line I now propose in place of that defined in 1940 would only be to add to Kuwait territory a narrow wedge of desert but it so happens that at the broader end of this wedge there are a few square miles of land which will become extremely valuable when the Umm Qasr port develops, and I consider that our special relations towards Kuwait make it incumbent on us to do nothing which will prejudice the Shaikh's claim to this land.5 p T land* I further consider that there is much to be said in favour of Mr* Wakefield's definition and am of opinion that if possible no pronouncement should now be made which will preclude the Kuwait authorities from arguing in favour of it when a commission to demarcate the frontier is eventually appointed* * S .% I 9. finally with reference to paragraph 2 of your telegram No*29C dated 22nd February 1942 I would respectfully suggest that even though agreement were to be reached now between the various British authorities concerned where the boundary line should run it is possible that when the time comes for actual demarcation personalities and conditions will have changed to such an extent that the agreement will be disregarded* I would therefore with all due deference advise that further attempts to define the exact line of the boundary should be abandoned and that we should remain content with the position as stated in paragraph 3 of His Majesty's Ambassador's telegram dated the 27th February 1942 to the Foreign Office that part of the area is in disputed territory, part in undisputably Iraq territory, and part in undisputably Kuwait territory and should treat the whole area as an exclusively military one for the duration of the war* 10.

I am unable to understand why Kuwait with its spacious hiarbour which I 'believe it would 'be practically impossible to effectively close is not made ready for immediate use should either the Shatt-al-Arab or the Khor Abdullah be obstructed at some time in the future. However I suppose the Military and Naval Authorities, the latter being I presumed vitally interested, have made their decision after''full consider-' ation and there is no more to be said. I am however sur prised that the American Mission should have reached the same conclusion without even taking the trouble to visit Kuwait and examine the position for themselves.y 53/87 &amp; 53/57 Telegram From To No. 0 /219 \ IDated and. received 19th March, 19 42.

While it niay not • 1/9 prove possible to keep dispute'^ut. question of frontier m cola storage indefinitely it seems from paragraph 1 most urgent problem is to establish workable system of administration in port area for duration of war. 2. I note that General Officer Commanding proposes to go into this problem at an early date. A solution can ?at present only be found locally but following observations may be of use to him. 3. Assuming as axiomatic that actual operatiom oi port will be under British military control there remains Vfor discussion number of jurisdictional questions viz. the general law which is to apply, civil and criminal the power to make local ordinances when courts i^ve- to try criminals other than British military personnel, financial questions including expenses of administration oi area Customs questions and port dues. It seems most desirable that arrangements shall be mat, simple as possible but problem will un doubtedly be complicated by two factors; (a) that part, of port area must be^assumed to be 0,171 n l.gwmntod—wi uh- iraq and parij^huwait and / (b) #1^ Cfi- P, U ■ A/o- 0 / &lt;rrr^7' ggp**. ii ■■wm rmm ICS /&gt; T-—(b) that population will be very mixed* It will -presuirifeobly inolude' british military personnel, british civilian officials some u.s.a.citizens, fyArt/y labour personnel which may 'be partly Iraqi Indian Kuwaiti partly British Indian and possibly others 9 who nay fall into none of these categories. 4. If demarcation of frontier is to be avoided it seems to us that solution may have to be sought on following lines. Administration of whole area including police, legislative judicial financial powers (including Customs) should all be vested in hands of one officer or official as Governor v/ho would presumably be a British officer. This Governor would derive his powers by being appointed jointly by Iraq and Kuwait and would be vested with these powers by both Governments. Port area would in fact be administered Some, ^.nder a Gondominium ?system to which the Sudan offers -an analogy. Governor when appointed could iflake an ordinance applying generally in area mut* Iraqi criminal and civil law or ^possibly Indian lav/ (if this seemed most convenient). He would have ?the ?power to make such local ordinances as were necessary. He could set up a court which might perhaps have Iraqis or Kuwaitis whose services could be called upon in appropriate cases. He would organise the Police. It might be convenient if port area were placed outside Custom bounds of the two countries wuioh could levy local customs duties on objects other than military supplies consumed in area. Revenue derived from these and from port dues, if any, and other local taxes, could be diverted to costs of administra tion. 5. Any such solution would of course require agreement of Iraq Government and of Shaikh of Kuwait (as indeed any plan does) and it is possible that in Iraq the agreement would have to be ratified by Iraq Parliament. Agreement could be explicitly a temporary one pending demarcation of frontier Suti/re- and an ?agreement between Iraq and Kuwait as to r mut . of port after war. -Secretary of State for India.11-7.

I contem plated something like the military administration of Razmak only more thorough and without any political interference.
