We have the honour to inform you that when this Corporation originally opened its station at Salalah, the Civil Aviation Direct orate in India made an arrangement with H.H. The Sultan whereby a coconut grove on the beach was rented as a camp site and a monthly rental of $*480 was agreed to, such rental apparently being based on a charge of #.1.00 for each palm tree making up the grove. 2. Since then the Corporation has had its own quarters built near this camp site but we are still paying the old rental of $.480 per month. This, at the present rate of exchange, amounts to Rs.960/- per month and we think you will agree that such a sum is far in excess of what the proper charge should be. In our opinion the rental for the present site of our buildings shoiil be in the neigh bourhood of $.50.00 per month and we should be extremely grateful if you could see your way to arranging with His Highness to reduce the rental in the near future. 3. In support of our request for this reduction we would also mention that we are only able to use our quarters during the winter months as they are quite uninhabitable during the monsoon.

Government of India have intimated that B.O.A.C. are running a purely military service between Egypt and Karachi via Muscat. CorporaLion can occasion ally carry passengers and have enquired whether Sultan would object to carriage of women passengers either (a) civilian or (b) in uniform. Government of India have informed Directorate of Civil Aviation that there is no objection to (b) but that prior reference to Muscat Government is desirable mut. (a). 2. As large planes cannot land at Muscat it is presumed that the service is along the Southern Arabian air route. Can you confirm ? 3. There would appear to be no objection to carriage mut. of either class except difficulties of accommodation and I would prefer to avoid reference to Sultan in each case under (a). Please telegraph your views. - Prior - 1 Resident, at Shiraz 1 Agent, Muscat.Telegrain S From Political Agent, Muscat, To Political Resident, at Shiraz. No.C/1235 Dated the 25th September 1943. Reference your T/828 of 20th September. 2. B.O.A.C. passengers are invariably service personnel or officials and I understand they now carry service mails. 3. Purely military service sounds as though a new service had been introduced about which I know nothing. It must be on Southern Arabian Route as Muscat l aerodrome is fit for VINCENTS and ANSONS only and no plane has been here for months. 4. I agree that Sultan*would be unlikely to raise i objection to carriage of women in uniform. 5. Regarding civilian women passengers, U.S.A.T.C. do occasionally carry them but usually do not night stop and Customs clerk does not meet plane as in case of 3.0.^.C. Matter would inevitably come to Sultan*s knowledge in case of B.O.A.C. . 6. I consider Sultan would raise no objection to the occasional carriage of civilian women passengers but that it should be restricted to the minimum essential. If this is done do not think Sultan need be consulted. 7. Regarding accommodation. No accommodation for women in Salalah and Masirah limited to two at the most. Best solution would if practicable be for planes not to night stop at either place. - Political -Pages 9 to 11 : Brought from Recess back by P.A.TELEGRAMS TELEPHONE BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION FLYING', KARACHI.

Sir, around Rent at Salalah 1. As requested by telephone, I attach hereto copy of our letter ref.GIB.032.0409 of *he 26th May, 1943. 2. In addition to the rental of $480.00 per month, we also pay a monthly charge of #120.00 for Police Guard, making a total monthly payment of #600.00, or Rs.1,200/- per month. 3. I think you will agree that such charges are prohibitive, although the rate at which the rental is charged at $1.00 per month per coconut tree is quite understandable and undoubtedly refers to rates for cultivators, etc., that have been in fo^rce possibly for many years. ./ 'Z.frH A'- 1 -' WSr' 4. As I informed you by telephone, according to our records these terms were agreed to by letter D.0.NO.&amp;/36 dated 15th January, 1942, from the Political Agency, Muscat, and addressed to a Mr. Campbell, Executive Engineer, Civil Aviation Directorate, Camp Muscat. 5. In addition to the rental referred to, there is a further liability of a payment of #20.00 compensation to the owner for every tree cut down. I would surmise that a certain number of trees were cut down whilst the buildings were being constructed, but whether or not adjustment has been made for this I am unable to tell. In any case, the fact remains that a rental charge equivalent to Rs.960/- per month is exhorbitant having regard to the fact that we are quite unable to realise against this rental by the sale or use of the coco nuts on the trees. 6. You will observe that these quarters are only used during the winter months and that during the monsoon period our staff have to quit these quarters and reside in quarters which have been made avail able for them on the R.A.F. Aerodrome. Would/7, Would you please examine the matter^and advise us fully if there is any chance of our obtaining a rebate on the rental charge.

Sir, With the ever growing complexity and worsening condition of the world currency situation, I have the honour to draw the attention of all your passengers to the monetary facilities pro vided by B.O.A.C. to its travellers; namely the Currency Coupons Books. The use of these books saves the passenger the necessity of carrying small amouhts of local currency of the vari« ious territories through which the Corporation^ services pass and the worry of providing himself with negotiable currencies which under the present conditions vary for each country and are often limited in number and difficult to obtain. 2. The passenger, owing to the small denominations of the Currency Coupons, is also saved considerable losses on wasted exchange, for may currencies are not negotiable outside their own territores. 3. the maximum number of books which may be purchased by any one passenger is eight, with a total value of R20-0-0. Payment for these books may be made in the local currency of the country where the purchase is made. Here at this station, the value of each book is Rs. 35-0-0. 4. The only limitations on Currency Coupons are as follows:- (i) Encashment of Currency Coupons outside the sterling area is limited to h 2/- per passenger nightstopping; (ii) They cannot be bought outside the sterling area and (iii) Passengers cannot be reimbursed for unused coupons in non sterling zones. Passengers therefore disembarking in a non sterling section of the route should cash the remainder of their coupons at the station before leaving the sterling area. Alter natively, should they wish, the Corporation can make arrangements for reimbursement on their behalf to banks or nominees within the sterling area. 5. The following stations on this route are at present outside the sterling area:- Marseilles Augusta Cairo Bangkok 0 I have the honour to be, Your servant, Sgd. G.F.W. Parker. Station Superintendent.
