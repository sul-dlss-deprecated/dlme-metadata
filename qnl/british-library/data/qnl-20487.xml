I've; (&amp;) please refer to the co/respondence resting with my demi-official letter No .c /989 dated the 1st October, 1947, and particularly to paragraph 2 of your demi- official letter No.l662-S d&amp;ted the 18th September, 1947. 2. Regarding the condition M7 and artizans -i ■ V !&gt;• ondition ofxlabetfrers a in Bahrain I was of the opinipw - vide paragraph 4 of my demi-pfficial letter No.C/958, dated the 11th September, 1947 - that the Bahrain Government should endeavour to retain their artizans in their employment by paying reasonable wages and by endeavouring to provide - by good administration - attractive living conditions in Bahrain rather than by restricting emigration in search of more profitabl^employment. 3. Ycm^ill seen from my demi-official letter No .C/989 x dated the 1st October, 1947, that the Bahrain Government have now decided to increase the wages of all their employees and that Smith estimates that this will cost the Bahrain Government an additional 5-J- lakhs a year excluding additional disbursements by the Electricity and Food Control Departments. 4. At the same time I have received from the Acting Adviser a proposal to abolish price and export controls on all commodities other than those for which quotas are allotted from India, or for which foreign exchange is granted by the Agency, A copy of his letter is enclosed. 5. The increase in wages to be made by the Bahrain Government - which will also have to be made by the Residency, the Agency, and other employers in Bahrain - will add considerably to the present excessive purchasing power which is already chasing inadequate supplies of consumer goods; and, in spite of controls, will contri bute directly and indirectly (through blackmarket opera tions) to the inflationary spiral in Bahrain. 6. While, therefore, I am in general sympathy with the desire of the merchant community for freedom from controls, I cannot ignore the increase in the cost of living of labourers, artizans, and clerks which would occur if there were a sharp rise in the prices of essential and semi-essential commodities in Bahrain. To permit such a rise by the removal of price and export controls would discount the increases in wages now being made, and would considerably diminish the present favour able ratio between wages and the cost of living, upon /which. The Hon'ble Lt-Col. A.C. Galloway, C .I .E., O.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain. &gt;— PERSIAN n'LF PESI D^NCY A/0 1.9 9 3 DATE b..; LO -.O ... CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS i-2- which the Bahrain Government and the companies here largely depend - or should depend - to retain their labour forces. 7. The merchants' argument that the removal of controls would induce them to import goods more freely and in larger quantities, and would reduce prices through the effects of competitidn, is one that can be supported by some examples, but many instances could be adduced to show that removal of controls has else where resulted in sharp rises in prices; because, however strong the merchants 1 desire freely to import large quantities of goods, many of the goods required here are just not available for export in sufficient quantities. For instance: there are a number of firms importing British textiles into Bahrain and none can get more than occasional token shipments of goods. 8. I have therefore carefully gone through the details of the Bahrain Government's proposal and have amended the current Order relaxing price controls on a large range of goods while retaining export controls and price controls on commodities which are essential to those in the lower income groups, and which are still in short supply. These changes meet most of the merchants' objections; and I have not gone further because I consider that the need to maintain stable prices for essential consumer goods (as a means of retaining the labour employed by the Oil Company on which the State depends) outweighs the desirability of meeting in full the merchants' demand for freer trading. 9. I enclose for your information a copy of Order No.8 of 1947 which supersedes Order No. 7 of 1947 sent to the Residency with Agency printed Letter No.2314 dated the 12th of July, 1947. ;!( NS.Copy of Memorandum No.PA/PC/11 dated the 17th September, 1947, from the Director of Customs &amp; Port Officer, Bahrain, to the Political Agent, Bahrain. ■ At a meeting held at the Adviserate yesterday, and at which the under-noted were present; His Highness Shaikh Sir Sulman bin Hamad A1 Khalifah, K.C.I.E.

Schedule II. to be abolished. Schedule III. To read; Cotton piecegoods of Indian origin under quota. Motor vehicles of United States or Canadian manufacture for which payment has been made with foreign currency obtained through this Agency, All articles for which payment has been made with foreign currency obtained through this Agency.
