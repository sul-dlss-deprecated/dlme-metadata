J vas very sorry to miss you during 'my recent visit to Bahrein I cailea at your house on my way back to the Agency after visiting these graves as I wished to talk over the matter with you; but unfortunately I did not meet you. I am inclined to agree with you that it will be best to transfer the bodies interred in the old site to the new cernetery. I feel sure that, there can he no ecclesiastical objection to this transfer. In addition to what you write on the matter, T recently had an opportunity of speaking to Bishop Stuart of the Church 'fission Society viho stayed with me for a few days on his way from Ispahan to New Zealand and he agreed that there could be no objection. Whether there is any local sentiment on the part of the Bahrein people against the removal of bodies after inter- ment is another mat-ter % This however is not likely to be strona—- 3C ■ stronq ana need not I think he considered . / s Will you therefore kindly arrange to transfer the remains as you sung est.

Zwemer, Secretary of the Arabian Mission Bahrein, to Lt-Colonel C, A. Kemball, Offq: Political ) Resident in the Persian Gulf, Tn continuance of the correspondence renarding the Tahrein Cemetery J beg to call to your notice that the graves near the Sheikh's castle at !''enamah are still in a neglected state; and that t altho we are grateful to the Indian Government for their grant toward building a wall / since this wall was built elsewhere y the graves mentioned need attention and protection. Our Mission regrets that the Chief was unwillina to allow the wall and cemetery to he built on the original site. But we unanimously are of the opinion that the best course to pursue is to transfer the bodies interred in the old site to the new cemetery. T can see no ecclesiastical or other objection to this transfer as the graves were never enclosed or 'consecrated' in the usual sense of that word. Our 'ission will be glad to superintend their transfer ci. d 1 ear our share of tne exjiense, which will be ver / small.-- I enclose a list of the graves and their inscriptions a? they existed in July 1893, at the time vfnen J first wrote to the Bush i re Now only the first wooden-slab is standing: all the others have been carried away or destroyed b^ the Arabs. In addition to these four graves there is the recent grave of the Chief Engineer of H. M, S. 'Sphinx' which has a marble slab on it.

In '^orelm Department letter No.631 T: \A. dated 84th April 1901, the Govem^ent sanctioned the grant of Rs.sSOO/- on the understanding that the unl^eep of the cemetery would in future be met hy nuhlic subscription. f .T Gaslrin accordingly annroached the Sheikh for a piece of ground for a cemetery, hut the sheikh,while .rlad to pive a piece of ground for such a purpose not unnaturally objected to a c^meter^ immediately under the wall of the fort in which he lives for about 4 months every hot weather. So another nlot about 50 Dhiras (cubits)j 30 yards / square, was selected behind t 3 nynAp date -rove to the east of the town of Manama and a wall errct d round it by 'r Gaskin at Government expense at a cost of Rs.V)0/-« fubsequent- ly with the approval of the then Resident Colonel T emball who visited the place himself in -lovember 1901, the old graves outside the Shaikh's fort wore removed to the new enclosure. At the present time the cemetery is looked after by the American Mission who provide funds fro^ offertories etc for or dinary expenses, such as waterinrr the f^w tamais^ trees etc while A ' special subscriptions are raised from time to time vrhenever neces sary to repair the wall. The cemetery is used for all denominations of Christians; Roman Catholics, Church of England, Presbyterians and ^embers of various non conformist sects - British ^Taval Officers and tea men, B.I.Officers, American missionaries, Ooanese and Paghdadi lie buried in it % Christians - A So far as I am aware it is unconsecrated ground; * a in fact the American missionaries, who are of the Dutch Reformed Church of America and very Protestant in their views, would not, I imagine, approve of the idea of consecrating ^round. I may add that when the question of a cemetery was raised at f owftt-C,Captain Shakespear .sked me for the Bahrein Agency Cementery file and I lent it to him. I have the honour to be. Sir.

To The Deputy political Eeeldent, B U 3 U I A K. 5uh.l3ct : - Grunt of a Donation towarde the repaire of the Bahrain Christian Oemetary. I reoiintly had oooasion to visit the local oemetary here which is looked aftsr by the American Mission. I was diatraased to find that a gap about £5 feet wide existed in t; e Southern wall through which childreii and others entered the oemetary ana foiled the ground in a diagusting manner. I t-lso found that the interior of the cemetary was badly neglected, and that several tomb-stones and crosses were badly damaged. Generally speaking the wholt? pl^oe presented a forlorn and uncared for appearance. On enquiri ng l*roro the Mission 1 gathered that shortage of funds was rssponsible for this state of affairs. I was told there was no immediato prospsct of An improvement. As the cemetary contains seven or eight tombs of men alld of the iioyal aavy and British Merchant Service, I think it wou^d be an act of grace and a duty if Oovernmant couli see its way to give a small grant towards the repair of the outer wall and the tidying up generally of the interior. 1 would suggest that a lump sura of k.» 500/- be presented at once and that a sum of k.S/- a month be palld the Mission as Government's share towards the pay of a gardener, the Mission finding the man and paying a similar sum. I feel sure the members of the Mission would accept £.he above with gratitude, as they tall mo they woutd do mort than they are doing if only they had funds. If you agree I would like your sanction to expending the sums suggested. —XJ) y\j Major, 0.
