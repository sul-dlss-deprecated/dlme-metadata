I think you nay like to know that the Shaikh of Jabal Akdhar, Shaikh Suleiman bin Hamayar is here at Dresent. I understand he is paying quite an extended visit. The Sultan brought him to call on me on January 1st. He is an eagle-eyed, eagled-nosed old brigand, but of course I could not have any conversation with him, partly because the Sultan was there, partly because he speaks nothing but Arabic. His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE., CSI., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000012_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/243</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000012</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/243</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 8/62 II PRINCIPAL SHAIKHS &amp; TRIBES OF OMAN'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1949/1949</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-04-19T22:05:17</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (1 folio)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 3; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file consists of a single brief letter from the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.
