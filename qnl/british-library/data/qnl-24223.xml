A&amp;viserats, FEB. 9, 1946. When the U.3.A.T.C. left Bahrain they sold all the equipment, vehicles, building material etc. etc., which they aid not take away, to Bapco without giving the Bahrain Government any opportunity of purchasing them. Much of the material which was sold would have been very useful to the Bahrain Government. It has now come to my notice that the British Military authorities have, in the same way, sold the whole of the Punjab Camp including electric fittings, 4000 bags of cement, wood, building materials, etc. to the agent cf Shaikh Mustafa bin Abdul Latif, a local Persian landowner. During my absence Smith was assured by Colonel Watson, the Disposals Officer who visited Bahrain, that the Bahrain Government would be afforded an opportunity of buying surplus material or stores which the army might sell here. In many cases the Bahrain Government itself constructed camps and buildings for use of the services and I consider that this, apart from other reasons, might entitle this Government to be afforded an opportunity of bidding for army surplus stores and materials. I should be very grateful if the service authorities in Bahrain could be asked not to dispose of surplus material without informing the Bahrain Government allowing it to make an offer. His Highness Shaikh Sulman was very displeased vhen he heard that the Americans had sold all that they had without informing him, but he put it down to their bei ng Americans, he will be even more concerned when he hears that the British authorities have sold their material to a local contractor who will now proceed to sell it at uncontrolled prices in the black market.

Customs duty at 5$ and import yard charges are due to the Bahrain Government on the goods which have been sold as well as 5$ royalty on the landing charges which would have been collected by the The land occupied by the camp, when used by the Army, was lent freely by His Highness. It is no longer used by the military therefore the Bahrain Government is entitled to charge rent against the purbhaser who, I understand, has been given until June to clear and remove his belongings.

Disposals Officer who visited Bahrain in the summer, the local British Military Authorities had sold the whole Punjab Camp including electric fittings, 4000 bags of cement, wood, building materials, etc., to a local Persian, and the Adviser also requested me to take steps to ensure that before Services sold any of the material that they had imported into Bahrain for their own use, the Bahrain Government should be given the opportunity of purchasing it. in doing so he pointed out that such material had been imported free of Customs duty and that the Bahrain Government were entitled to recover the duty on the goods sold. 2. I, therefore, issued Order No.3 of 1946 of which I enclose a copy. Since the issue of the Order the R.A.F. have reported that with the exception of one Ford saloon car no surplus material has been disposed of.

Liquids supplied to passengers made from Bahrain water direct from wells have ai*oused perpetual complain ts. You will, therefore, appreciate that we are anxious to q uell such complaints as speedily as possible by obtaining water from the distillation plant at the Naval Base, permission has already been obtained for the supply of the gallonage required from the authority concerned. The water-carrying vehicle is therefore required for the purpose of transporting the distilled water from the Naval Base to Corporation premises. (b) A Utility Wagon suitable for the use of the Station Manager's day to day running in connection with his duties and for the transport on occasions of V.I.Ps, etc. The vehicle asked for is not entirely suitable for the transport of V.I.Ps, etc., but it would meet the dire need until such time as a new imported car is allocated to the Corporation by H.B.M’s political Agent, Bahrain.

The Shaikh wanted it to light his house. I am informed that it is quite unsuitable for house lighting and have explaire d this to him. I have allotted the plant to the Oil Company whose representative states that it is required for their airfield at Buraimi. 4. I have, however, suggested to the Shaikh that he can import from the United Kingdom a small set specially designed for house lighting; and I should be grateful if you could let me have, for him to see, the catalogue of Lister engines at present in the Agency.

(28) Issued Memo. No.C/370 dated 9.4.*46 to the Adviser, Bahrain Govt. (29) Issued Endt. No.c/371 dated 9.4.'46 to the Station Manager, BOAC. Commander Herring, U.S. War Disposals Officer in the Persian Gulf area, came to see me yesterday morning, accompanied by Mr. Hart, the American consul, Dhahran. Commander Herring showed me an inventory of equipment, most of which appeared to be of a highly technical nature, belonging to various wireless installations established by - the U.S. Army and Air Force in Dhahran, Sharjah, Masira and Salalah. He explained that all this equipment had been offered to the R.A.F. but stated that the latter have not yet been able to say how much of it they want, and have, therefore, sugg.r^ted that the equipment should now be offered to other prospect- e buyers subject to the proviso that the R.A.F. would still^have first refusal. Commander Herring informed me that the U.S. authorities were most anxious to dispose of the equipment quickly, if possible locally, and preferably in bulk as opposed to small lots. Failing^satisfactory local offers, they were, however, prepared to ship all movable equipment elsewhere for disposal. I explained to Commander Herring that this Agency was directly concerned only with Sharjah, and I have had copies taken of that part of the inventory relating to the equipment now in Sharjah. I doubt whether much of this would be of any use to the Bahrain State or to us and i have ascertained from Cuble &amp; Wireless Limited that they too are doubtful whether the equipment in Sharjah would be suitable for them. They are however, making enquiries from their London headquarters on the subject. As far as Dhahran is concerned I understand that anything not required by the R.A.F. is being handed over in toto to the Saudi Arabian Government. The other two places, that is, Masira and Salala^ are the Muscat Agency and I suggested to Cof^ander Herring that^he had better communicate direct either with t. Secretary to the political Resident or wtlth the political Agent, Muscat. x added that in actual fact the amount of equipment was so large and expensive, that unless the U.S. Disposal Board's u C1 i! lon to se -^ onl y i n bulk was rescinded, it was doubtful whether anyone in the Persian Gulf Area (other than the R.A F who already have the first refusal) was likely to want it or to be in a position even to buy it. Heagain emphasized that he was most keen to get a decision on the disposal of the material as quicKlv as possible and stated that since he might be coming to Bahrain again on Wednesday the 10th, he would then like, if ?? 3S i b i e ’u t ? See either the P-A. or the p.R. i explained that cho had a number of engagements to fulfil in a comparatively short time and tha„ it might not be possible for the Resident to see him personally. I suggested, however, that should he come to Bahrain tomorrow he should contact me again and I would then see whether he could interview either the P.A. or the P.R. _ ! a. 2 7 ■ 31 . njf 0LA.CC, x-j ~3o aw• ^ p •</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000228_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1817</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000228</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1817</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 36/107 Prohibition Regarding Sale of Serviced Property'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1946/1947</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-04-29T11:47:06</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (22 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the inside back cover with 222; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located at the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
