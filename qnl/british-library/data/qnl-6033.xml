My dear Sir Kupert, Please refer to ray Savingraia No. C/71 of the 5th April, 1949. 2. Dr. Aicopiantz has now left Kuwait, and the question arises whether or not we should try to get the Kuwait Government to agree to employ a British doctor &lt; f) I ■ ■ I m I In his place. , 3* My own impression is that, v/hile His Highness might possibly desire in a vague sort of way to have a good Government Hospital, he does not desire it sufficiently strong to insist on getting it. Ihe Finance Department of the State is, as you Know, in the hands of Abdullah Salim. In the past money was collected for a hospital and the materials were misappropriated by Fahad as Salim, who built himself a large house with them. 4. The present Director of the Health Department is one Nasf Yousuf an Masf a member of the opposition to the Sheiich in 1937. I get the impression that he and his supporters are not so much interested in a hospital as such as in a hospital as an institution having a budget to be spent under their direction so that a good deal of the money finds its way into the pockets of their collaborators. I doubt very much H.E. 3ir fiupert Hay, KCIE. # GDI., Political fiesident, Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain.very much whether a British Doctor would find himself able to worK for them at all; * and, in any case, while they pay high salaries (they have Do do that -do gez any doctor), they are bad employers who have no knowledge of professional etiquette and little respect for written contracts. In is not surprising that both Drs. Mylrea and Scuddor refused the post. 5. fhe Health Department will probably be able to find a Palestinian or other Arab doctor who will meet their requirements if even he is not able to get the hospital going; and, while we should watch the situation, I do not thims we should interfere until our assistance is asked for. Yours sincerely, Sd. G.N JacksonPERSIAN GOLF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. (149/33/49) 30th April 1949 V/ Please refer to Galloway’s letter (86/5/48) of the 29th September, 1948 about Akopiantz. 2. This man soon after his arrival was involved in a motor accident for which it is believed he was largely to blame and subsequently fell foul of the Kuwait authorities who terminated his contract. He pestered the Political Agent to intervene on his behalf, but as his appointment was made without the Politi cal Agent's intervention and generally speaking he had not a good case Galloway refused to interfere officially. He did however mention the case to the Shaikh's Secretary with some effect (vide the enclosed copy of the report from Jackson)* Jackson is letting roe know in more detail the nature of the Kuwait Government's complaints against Akopiantz, but from what the Shaikh said to me I understand that amongst other things, he was out to make as much money for himself as he could. 3. The Shaikh has now told me that he has written to Kemp, who as you know is his representative in London under his agreement with the Kuwait Oil Company and the American Indepen dent Oil Company, to obtain the services of a British doctor as his chief medical officer. I consider it most important that the contract of any British doctor engaged by the Shaikh should be scrutinised by us and that we should Insist on its containing a clause appointing the Political Agent as arbitra tor in the event of any dispute regarding its terras. It is also most Important that we should ensure that a suitable man is found. The Shaikh in conversation said that he would like a man of the type of missionary doctor and not a money-grabber. Some British subjects with whom I have discussed the matter have re marked no British doctor could stick the job for six months. The trouble is that there are too many vested Interests and it is impossible to keep everybody satisfied. I enclose a copy of a letter 0/79(13/9) of the 12th April from Jackson which gives some explanation of the position. I should be grateful If you could kindly make sure that Kemp does not send anybody out to Kuwait without our first knowing all about him and vetting his contract. 4 . 4. We have an ex Church Missionary Society doctor in charge of the State Hospital at Bahrain and he is a great success. I am writing privately to Sir Henry Holland the well known Church Missionary Society doctor who recently returned from Quetta to ask him if he knows of anybody who would like to be considered for the Kuwait appointment. 6. This matter has some bearing on the whole question of British advisers for Kuwait as if we can find them a doctor who proves a success, the Shaikh is more likely to turn to us for assistance in running the other departments of his Government. Incidentally, I asked him when at Kuwait whether there was any advance in the position regarding the appointment of British advisers and the only reply I could get out of him was that he would ask for them when he wanted them. 6.

We have now heard from Kemp that he has recommended to the Sheikh and the Kuwait Health Department that a certain Mr. Eric Parry should he appointed on a three year contract as Chief Medical Officer Kuwait at a proposed salary of £3,500 per annum with increments. Kemp did not consult us in this selection as we had expected hut from Parry’s particulars, copies of which are enclosed for your personal, information, it seems unlikely that he could have found a better qualified man for this appointment. Kemp has assured us that he has explained to Parry the difficulties of the set-up in Kuwait and has pointed out to him that he can have no legal redress in this country if things go wrong. Unfortunately Parry does not speak Arabic (none of the candidates seen by \emp did) but he is arranging to study the language here to fit himself for the appointment should the Sheikh accept Kemp’s r e c omrne nd a t i on. In the circumstances we have decided that it would not be politic for us to suggest to the Sheikh that the terms of the proposed contract, which Kemp has drafted on his own responsibility on the basis of the oil companies’ usual contracts, should include a clause appointing the Political Agent as arbitrator in the event of any dispute regarding its terms. e have however mentioned the point to Kemp. You wall be interested to know that Kemp has told us that the Sheikh has asked him to find three men, possibly C, ex-Palestine Police Force, to assist in re-organising the Ll Kuwait police guards, etc. The proposal is, however, still embriionxc as the question of terms has/ still to be clarified.

E 7734/1794/91 29, Pages Lane, Muswell Hill, London, N.1C. 11th July, 1949. R. A. Clinton-Thomas Esq., Foreign Office, S. W.l. Dear Clinton-Thomas, Thank you very much for your letter of 7th July which I received this morning. I do not, in fact, know anything of the trouble which you mention as having taken place over Dr. Akopiantz’s appointment. The -first suggestion I heard of there being any was Rogers’ mention of it when he telephoned me on 23rd June. You see, when I was last in Kuwait (December, 1948) there was no indication that I would have to undertake the various staff-selecting jobs that have since come my way and I made no enquiries about matters beyond my concern. Hence, my present ignorance. The terms of the contract which I have drafted . for Parry - and propose to use as a basis for the others - exclude the final clauses of the normal oil company type of contract which provide for arbitration of any dispute in London under the Arbitration Acts and for the contract to be construed in accordance with the laws of England. This exclusion was deliberate on my part and I make a point of explaining to anyone concerned that he can have no legal redress in this country if anything should go wrong. As I think you will see, it would be extremely difficult for me to propose the insertion of a clause providing for arbitration by the political Agent and, if you want it, I feel that the initiative can only come from H.M. Government. With regard to the police for Kuwait, I am pro gressing moderately well, but a very limited number of men is available to choose from owing to the fact that the Palestine Force was disbanded so many months ago. However, the vacancies have been publicised and I think I am in touch with such men as are to be had. If I get into diffic ulties, I will certainly ask if you can give me any help. I am also now starting to find a British Matron for the Kuwait Hospital. I want to get that under way and, if possible, the selection made before Parry leaves here. Yours sincerely, (SGD). H.T. KEMP.The Political Agency, Kuwait No. (4/40) Dear Residency, Reference your confidential letter No, 57/13/49 of the 6th September, 2* The contracts of the Police Officers contained clauses purporting to make them subject to the Kuwait Courts. This has since been rectified. 3. Parry and the Matron signed contracts on the lines of the Oil Company’s contracts with their senior staff - of which we enclose a specimen copy - without paras 18 and 19. Yours ever, AGENCY.

G ON ITIDSNTIAL 220/4/49 25th October, 1949. I visited Kuwait from the 3th to the 10th 9 - ^ October on my way to Cairo fca and Aden. The Sheikh called on me at the Agency at 9 a.m. on the 9th and the conversation was of a formal and colourless, nature. I immediately returned the call accompan ied by Jackson and as soon as we were seated the Sheikh in somewhat circumlocutory language made an apology for his behaviour to me during his visit to Bahrain last June. I said quite briefly that I had been deeplyoffended but agreed to let bye- gones be byegones. I was the more ready to do this as not only has Jackson on more than one occasion pointed out to him the error of his ways but since his return from Bahrain his attitude towards us has been more than usually satisfactory. In fact I found She general atmosphere at Kuwait better than I have ever known it and left the place without the feeling of dejoression and frus tration which I usually experienced on previous visits. 2. The Sheikh’s new Chief Medical Officer, Vo. Parry, is an excellent man. He appears to like the job and should prove a great success. In SK 4 . addition to a British matron the Sheikh is trying w to obtain the services of two more British doctors one to work as an anaesthetist and the other as an eye-specialist. The new hospital has now been _ equipped and is a going concern. The three British police officers are settling down and are of the greatest assistance to the Political Agent. They are however employed only for dealing with persons subject to the Order-in-Council and play no part in the training of the local police. A fine new thoroughfare has been completed from the Customs jetty to the main square and at numerous points in the town traffic police deal fairly efficiently with the constant stream of motor vehicles. On the educational side a number of small boys of primary school age have been sent to the Victoria College at Alexandria and it has been decided to send no more boys from the secondary classes to indefatigable in keeping in close personal touch with Sheixkh Ahmad and with the more important members of the ruling family and leading merchants and the improved atmosphere which 1 found there is in my opinion largely attributable to his energy and ability. I am very sorry indeed that he is leaving us so soon. 4. I am sending copies of this letter to Troutbeck and Jackson. Cairo. 3 Jackson during his time at Kuwait has been Sdg. W.R. Hay. B.A.3.
