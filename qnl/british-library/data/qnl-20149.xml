From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To—L ieutena.nt- C olonel C. A. K emball , Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 213, dated the 27th November 1901, regarding the wish of Sheikh Mubarak that a Post Office may be opened at Koweit. 2. The Government of India would not be unwilling to extend the postal service to Koweit. The difficulty at present is to find a proper locus standi for a Post Office at that port. The Post Offices hitherto maintained by the Indian Government in the Persian Gulf and Turkish Arabia are not separate ottices. They depend upon the Political or Consular authorities, and the Post Masters, even if paid entirely by the Postal Department, are usually borne on the Political or Consular establishments. If a Native Agent were appointed to Koweit, it would be simple to give him an extra allowance for conducting the business of the Post Office, for which there will be a stronger case when Koweit is, once a fortnight, made a regular port of call by the British India steamers on their downward journey. But it is considered that the Native Agent should come first and the Post, Office afterwards. 3. I am to ask you to consider this suggestion and to favour the Govern ment of India with your opinion upon it. It is considered that it would be useful, and probably agreeable, to the Sheikh that we should have a Native Agent at Koweit, and I am to enquire whether, if such appointment were made, a suitable man can be found for it, and what, in your judgment, would be a reasonable rate of pay to give him.No. 43, dated Bushire, the 1st March 1902 (Confidential). From— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball , Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 156 E.-A., dated 20th January, on the subject of the establishment of a British Post Office at Koweit. 2. The suggested appointmep-t of a Native Agent at Koweit has, in mv opinion, much to recommend it, and I could, I believe, find a suitable man for the post. It will be advisable, if the post is created, that the Agent should not be allowed to indulge in trade, and a salary of Es. 200 a month should, I think, be paid to him exclusive of the allowance for conducting the work of the Post Office when it is opened. Before, however, the matter of appointing an Agent at Koweit is definitely decided, I think it as well to submit the following points for the consideration of the Government of India. 3. In accordance with the Agreement entered into with the Chief of Koweit in January 1899, the reception by him of an Agent or representative of a Foreign Power cannot be permitted without the consent of the British Govern ment. It is, therefore, a matter for the consideration of the Government of India whether the appointment by us of a regular Agent might not at the present time be found to be inconvenient. So long as we have no Agent at Koweit, we can object to the presence of the Agent of any other Power at the place as being a bre^gh of the status quo, which we have declared our intention to maintain ; but if you appoint an Agent and at the same time refuse to admit the Agents of other Powers, might it not be said that we ourselves were disturb ing the status quo ? It is probable that this point has not escaped the notice of the Government of India, and is not considered to be a valid objection to the appointment of an Agent by us. 4. ^ Further, it has to be considered that the fortnightly service of the British India Steam Navigation Campany to Koweit has not yet been instituted. Owing to the disturbed state of the Nejd and Shammar country and the imme diate environs of Koweit, the trade of the port of Koweit is not of sufficient importance to justify the company in maintaining a regular service with the place. In any case, therefore, it may be advisable to defer the appointment of the Agent until the present crisis is over and a regular steamer service instituted. It seems to me, therefore, that, in consideration of all the circum stances, it will be advisable to keep the question in abeyance for the present. I have^ not thought it advisable to ascertain the views of Sheikh Mubarak on the subject.^ It is probable, as the Government of India say, that the appoint. nient ot a Native Agent would be agreeable to him. He would perhaps look on it as a further step towards the Protectorate which he desires.JNo. 677 E-A., dated Simla, the 5th April 1902.

DUKING the course of a prolonged conversation with the French Ambassador to day, he re.erred to the attitude of the British, or as he put it, the Indian Govern rnent towards other Powers in the Persian Gulf. He regarded the pretentions of ' .. p Government as excessive, and attributed to them a desire to treat the Gufasa Bnt'sh lake. He thought it would be impossible for us to persist in a policy of his kind. I he Anatolian Railway would have its terminus at some point upon the Gulf, which would^ then become a highway for international commerce, and we must look this prospect in the face. I replied that his Excellency was mistaken in attributing to us or to the Govern ment of India a desire to exclude the trade of other countries from Persian waters. Jm attitude towards tlie Anatolian Railway project had been far from unfriendly 1 had, indeed, within the last few days, explained to the German Ambassador that we were quite prepared to facilitate the construction of the line, but that our support was not to be expected unless we were given a share at lea.st equal to that of any other Power in the capitalization of the Company, in its management, and in the orders for materials and equipment. M. Cambon observed that he could say Jconfidently that there was no desire to deny sufficient opportunities to British capitalists, but that when the project had been mooted in hnancial circles, the overtures which had been made had met with a very cold response m the City. a wiy I replied that that might be so but that the question was stili under discussion exits in 6 the 'Persian Cnlf ^ th f e f were , 0 ''' fee,in g s with ^gard to the commercial exits in the 1 ersian Gulf, we entertained the strongest objection to and should ertainly oppose, any attempt on the part of other Powers to create strategical bases or fortified harbours m those waters.

I am commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to forward to you herewith, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India in Council, a copy of a letter, dated 27th May last, from the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf Division ol' the East Indies Station, reporting on the political situation in Nejd. I am, &amp;c., E van M acgregor. Report on the present situation in Nejd, H. M. S. ' Lapwing ', Bushire, Sir, 27th May 1902. I have the ^ honour to forward you the following report on the present situation in ' Nejd ' with a short summary of the events which have led up to it. I venture to do this, as all Koweit's western border is contiguous to 'Nejd ', and the condition of affairs in the latter country may seriously affect the political situation in the former. 'Feyznl-bin-Turki-bin-Said', former Amir of Nejd, was in the direct line of the A\ ahabi Amirs. He died leaving three sons : the elder, 'Abdullah- bin-Said ', becoming Amir. A quarrel soon arose between the new Amir and one of his brothers, and some fighting took place. During these internal disturbances ' Mahomet-bin-Rashid ', Sheikh of ' Hail ', who formerly owed some sort of allegiance to the Amir of Nejd, revolted, attacked, and in the end obtained supreme power in Nejd. ' Mahomet-bin-Ilashid ' died about 1899, and ' Abdul Azis-bin-Tlashid his cousin, succeeded him. He has become a protege of the Turks, and has for some time been menacing Koweit. Abdul Kahman-bin-Said, the third and only living son of Feyzul-bin-Said, has been living at Koweit for some time. He is a friend of Sheikh Mubarak and has been receiving a sort of pension from Basrah c n condition he remained quietly at Koweit, but payment of this was stopped at the beginning of this year. About a year ago, Abdul Azis-bin-Said, son of Abdul Kahman, went south, and finding that the Sheikh of Kharj and certain other Sheikhs were billing to assist him, collected a force and, at the beginning of this year, captured Riadh. As far as I can gather, he has now gained possession of a arge portion of the surrounding country, in fact all the southern half of Nejd, including Mangoohah, Deryayeh, Kharj, Harik and the Yemamah country. Kasim and most of the western country, including Bureidah, Shakra, e a jcl, as well as Hail, are still in the hands of bin-Rashid, but, according to a ^Qnnts the Sheikhs and people of these countries are very dissatisfied ^ ilns rule, and are only waiting for a favourable opportunity to £0 over to bin-Said. A great number of the better class Wahabis and otherp of Nejd have left country during bin-Rashid's supremacy, and have been living at Basrah J other places. A portion of these, as well as the Sheikhs of Ajman and A1 _ uriali (a large tribe who live in the Ahsa, or Hasa country) with large tli ^ ave a ttached themselves to Abdul Rahman, who left Koweit on e loth instant to join his son Abdul Azis in Riadh.Bin-Rasliid lias been in Kasim for the last month or two, but, according to the latest news, he went over to the west of Nejd about a fortnight ago to punish a tribe called the ' Beni Abdullah on this expedition he has met with little success, losing 30 or 40 of his men killed and 1G0 horses, and he has now retired to Hail. At the end of last December the Russian Consul from Bushire went over to Koweit in the ' Varyag ^ and saw Abdul Rahman-bin-Said. The Consul offered him Russian assistance and protection, and said that, if Abdul Rahman wrote to him asking for assistanoe to regain his country, the Russian Govern ment would give it. Sheikh Mubarak apparently dissuaded him from doin^ this, and Abdul Rahman has now written to the Political Resident at Bushire asking for British protection. He states that he does not want any assistance in regaining his country, and is apparently quite confident in his ability to effect this himself. The reason that Rahman wishes the British Government to watch his interests apparently is that he fears complications with the Turks. I may add that there has been a rumour current for some time that the Turks have offered bin-Rashid assistance in his operations, but I am given to understand that no movements can take place during the summer months owing to the scarcity of water. During April last a Russian who styled himself a geologist stayed at Koweit for about a week : but I could not discover that he made any diplomatic overtures to either Abdul Rahman or Sheikh Mubarak.

The file includes copies of direct correspondence between Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ, the ruler of Kuwait and British officials regarding Mubārak's desire for British protection and the nature of Kuwait's relationship with the Ottoman Empire.The correspondence also discusses the rivalry and conflict between Shaikh Mubārak (and his tribal allies including the Al Saud) and the ruler of the Emirate of Jabal Shammar and head of the Rashidi tribal dynasty, Abdul Aziz Ibn Mitab [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin Mit‘ab]. The desire of Abdul Rahman Bin Feysal El Saood [‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] to be made a 'protege' of the British government is also discussed as is the possibility of establishing a post office in Kuwait (and recruiting a native agent to serve the British there).The file contains a number of reports (in their original Arabic, with English translations attached) concerning political affairs in Kuwait that were written by Ali bin Ghulam Reza, a news agent in Kuwait employed by the British.A section of correspondence in the file relates to the arrrest, by Ottoman authorities, of Shaikh Mubārak's agent in Bussorah [Basra], Abdul Aziz El Salim [‘Abd al-‘Azīz al-Sālim]. El Salim was accused of being a subscriber to
                           Khilafat, an Arabic newspaper published in London said to be critical of the Ottomans.
