Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the letter have already been dealt with, vide correspondence ending with my telegram No. 506 dated the 24th December 1941. 3. In his paragraph 3, he says: 'If the boundary in the concession is not the final decision and particularly if the area it shows is likely to be decreased in any direction, it is importa nt that we should know.....'. Jhe question of the south eastern boundaries with Saudi Arabia has not been settled yet, vide u correspondence ending with India Office letter No. P.3o 4199/39 dated the 10th August 1939 and presumably we cannot therefore inform the Company that the boundary of the concession is the final /- s. 5.

The proposed boundary line, however, which would form the basis of the negotiations with the Saudi Government begins well to the south of Jebel Naksh and runs thence in a south easterly direction well away from Khor el Odeid and Abu Dhabi territory. The concession boundary on the otner nand is that shown on the enclosed map and runs well to the north of the proposed boundary, it would be possible therefore to inform the Company that the concession area is not likely to be decreased if and v/hen boundary discussions are resumed. 4. As regards paragraph 4, the erection of Company bea cons to mark the concession boundary may give rise to ques tions by the Saudi authorities but i see no reason why this should stop chem since they are entitled to exploit their concession and to mark its boundaries if required. y / \ Political Agent, Bahrain* / vide telegram No. 112 dated the 18th November 193b from H.M. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London.Copy of demi-official letter No. DO/3AA.2/2760 dated the 22nd December 1941 from the Manager, Petroleum Conces sions Limited, Bahrain, to the Political Agent, Bahrain. Qatar Boundary Reference the rumours of which 1 spoke to you that the Shaikh of Qatar during his visit to Mecca had made some concessions to the claims of ibn Saud amounting to agreement that the Qatar-Saudi Arabian boundary could be on a line from Jabal Naksh practically due east. 1 broached the subject to the Shaikh of Qatar at ..ajibah on Tuesday the 16th December. He was very definite in his statements that the matter of this boundary had not been discussed with Ibn Saud or any one else during his visit to Saudi Arabia on Haj and he was unaware of any fresh developments in this boundary question. He took the view that the map included in the Qatar Concession documents could be assumed as correct for the purpose of the Company 1 s operations. T ..e have no records in our office on the situation between H.B.M's Government, Qatar and Saudi Arabia as re gards this boundary. If the boundary in the Concession is not the final decision and particularly if the area it shows is likely to be decreased in any direction, it is important that we should know as our surveyors have been recently working near the boundary. In this connection, we should like to know if, in your opinion, it is permissible or desirable at this stage for us to put in some Company beacons to mark the boundary as shewn in the Concession. We realize that it is possible that this matter is still under consideration by the India Office, and our London principals are kept informed, in these days, how ever, it takes three or four months for us to contact our Head Office and get their views.GONFIDSNTIAL * D«0« No# C/ioil • %\\*m 'jo j ll*f olitical Agency, Muscat# The 29th June 1944. /r Subjects Muscat Bo undaries When I was in Salalah, the Sultan gave me details of what he considered were the interior boundaries of Muscat (excluding the Imaa 1 ® territory). They are as follows, beginning from South of the Trucial Coast: Point A to Point B to Point C 52° 23' 22° 40' 54° 40' 22° 40* 55° 40' 22° ( South of Baraimi). to Point D to Point S - 55' S 20 N • 52 19 S N (North of Has Darbat Ali)» i 2. The Sultan said that these were given to him by Watts but there is no such record in this office. The points however correspond most peculiarly to a Desert Zana (suggested by the India Office in 1936 and communicated under Residency Confidential printed letter No. 199-S of 1935), known as the Blue Line.

In 1940, Howes and Hickinbotham drew up maps of the Northern tip of Muscat and in 1936 Watts drew a map of the State from Khor Kuwai to Has Darbat Ali, giving the Sultan authority over only a very narrow coasted strip, A copy was sent to the Senior Naval Officer but there is no record that one was forwarded to the Residency.
