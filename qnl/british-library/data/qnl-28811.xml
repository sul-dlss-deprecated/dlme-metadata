I HAVE the honour, with reference to my despatch No. 299 of the 21st June, to inform you that the Shah of Persia left Angora on the 20th June by train for Smyrna. His Majesty was accompanied by the Gazi, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 2. A halt was made at Eski§ehir on the way and a visit paid to the air port, where an aerial display took place, which included evolutions performed by an aeroplane which had been presented to the Shah by the Turkish Government. 3. At Smyrna the Shah and the Gazi personally directed manoeuvres carried out by a considerable number of troops which they had previously inspected. The operations included aircraft attacks and anti-aircraft defence. After a two days’ visit, they left for Balikesir, where they stopped the night, and then went on to Qanakkale on the Dardanelles, where they spent two hours and whence they embarked on a Turkish steamer for Constantinople, escorted by two destroyers. 4. On landing at the Seraglio Point they entered open motor cars and were driven, followed by their suites, to the Palace of Dolmabahge, where the Shah was lodged during his visit, the Gazi staying in the Palace of Beylerbey on the opposite side of the Bosphorus. Two triumphal arches had been erected on the bridge connecting Istanbul with Pera, one at the expense of the municipality and the other of the Persian colony. 5. The visit to Constantinople lasted six days, during which time the Shah visited the Naval and Military Academies, the museums and mosques, the university and several schools. On many of these visits His Majesty was accom panied by the Gazi, and together the two heads of State made trips up the Bosphorus and into the Sea of Marmora, where they landed and mingled with the crowd on the water front. One afternoon they arrived unheralded at Therapia and spread confusion in the now almost moribund Hotel Tokatlian by announcing their intention of spending the night there with their suites. When bedding and provisions had been hastily assembled, they changed their minds and decided to return to their respective palaces. A ball had been announced to be held at Dolmabah^e Palace, and invitations had been sent out, though not to the Diplomatic Corps. At the last moment, however, it was cancelled and a torch light procession of boats past the palace was the only public entertainment to take place. 6. The visit came to an end on the 2nd July, when the Shah left for Trebizond on a Turkish steamer, escorted by two destroyers and accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Enis Bey, the Turkish Ambassador designate at Tehran. From Trebizond the same land route is being followed as on the outward journey, the intention being to reach Tehran on the 8th July. 7.

Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received July 18.) (No. 314.) Sir, Gulhek, June 28, 1934. I HAVE the honour to report that a special sitting of the Majlis was summoned for the 26th June, in order that a congratulatory telegram from the President of the Turkish Grand National Assembly, occasioned by the visit of the Shah to Angora, might be read. 2. In the course of the debate, the importance to Persia of friendship with Turkey was emphasised, as was the significance of the fact that the Shah’s first visit to a foreign country should have been to Turkey, and the hope was expressed that this meeting would do much to cement good relations between the two countries and to efface memories of past differences. Tribute was also paid to the great, and even extraordinary, interest taken in the welfare of their respective peoples by the Gazi and the Shan. 3. The vernacular daily press abounds in articles of fulsome praise of Turkish and Persian virtues as exemplified in their two rulers, and in some of them hints are conveyed regarding the usefulness of Turco-Persian friendship in thwarting the wicked deeds of the imperialists and their appetite for colonisa tion. The language used is so similar to that of recent articles about Iraq, that one assumes that the underlying idea is that the two nations will now be able to unite to assist Iraq to liberate herself from the trammels of the “ Imperialists ” by joining a Near Eastern Pact.

The papers about the Shah's three weeks 1 visit to Turkey last June have not been previously submitted because the information about the reason for the visit contained in telegraphic reports seemed somewhat meague and it was thought that it might possibly be supplemented when despatches were received. Three despatches from H.M. Minister in Turkey and one from H.M. Minister in Persia about the Shah^s visit are now attached but, in fact, they add little of importance to the views expressed by Sir Percy Lorraine in his telegram of Both June ( P.Z.4506/34 and confirmed by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs that ’’beyond emphasising and 5041 2000 1.31strengthening Turco-Persian friendship ... there was no political significance in the Shah's visit nor were any novel treaties, conventions, etc.. conversations about/commercial exchanges between Foreign Minister, very little was done even in that direction. Certain sections of the press in this country found it very difficult to believe that the Shah's first visit to a foreign country -*fcould have been unattended by spectacular results (see, fcr example, Mr. Goldman's article in the 'Evening Standard' of 11th July, flagged) S and it was suggested that a four-power agreement, probably of a military character, had been concluded^or was on the point of being concluded^ between Turkey, Persia, Iraq and Afghanistan and that an understanding had been reached for the construction of a railway from Trebizond by way . of Persian Azerbaijan the Caspian coast to Herat and Kabul. The first suggestion seemed, I prima facie , extremely improbable in view of the strained relations existing between Persia and Iraq on account cf ii^utstanding dispute concerning the Shatt-el-4 ra b frontier, and the Foreign Office were satisfied that the Turkish Government, whose relations with H.M.G. are extremely cordial, would have ( informed us about any such project. (The alleged four-power agreement has some affinity with the idea recently mooted of a regional non-aggression pact embracing Afghanistan,r 3 Minute Paper. Department. Persia, Iraq, Turkey,^U.S.S,R. and Great Britain - see papers in the attached file). The second suggestion regarding a grandiose railway project seems to be ruled out, at any rate for the present. The Shah seems to have established excellent personal relations with the Ghazi and the success of his visit has no doubt increased his own prestige in Persia. It was natural that he should take a great interest during his visit in Turkish military affairs. The Shah’s first visit to a foreign country may possibly help him to take a somewhat broader view on international questions. for financial reasons.

The streets were decorated in every town of Persia and the police made sure that the loyal citizens should hang carpets from their windows by a series of domiciliary visits, which did not omit the houses of eertain British subjects. The Pahlevi Koad was strewn with earpets for the royal car to pass over, but I hear that Hie Majesty eluded a public weloome by slipping into the capital by a aide street. He then went straight to his country palace in Shlmran, where he received the congratulations of the Council of Ministers and the Deputies. Meanwhile the Tehran Chamber of Commerce arranged, at snort notice, a large evening party at the Iran Club, to which the diplomatic corps were invited along with all the Tehran notable*. There was feasting and dancing, but the members of ay staff did not notice any very exceptional enthusiasm. Only one member of the Imperial suite was there, the others being too tired, and it was not possible to gather any impressions of interest regarding the journey and its real object. It is, /however. The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.however, generally assumed that the reception given to the 3h&amp;h in Turkey surpassed ell expectations and that His Majesty was genuinely delighted with it, especially when the Gnazi ordered his army to kneel in the Shah's presence The press has, of course, been so fulsome as to he nauseating in its flattery, hut the Shah naturally gets much more glory than his hosts, though friendly sentiments towards the Turkish ^hrother 1 * abound. 3. One incident, which is causing a good deal of comment, is the fact that the Turkish Ambassador, Hiclvanbey Oglu Hus rev Bey, who left Tehran with the shah, has not returned, but instead his successor, Anis Bey, has arrived with the Imperial suite. It is not known why this change has been made, though Husrev Bey has long yearned for a more civilised post and by his outspokenness has not endeared himself to the Persians. 4. It seems to be generally expected that many innovations will follow the Sovereign'a*first excursion out of Persia, but up till now the only new idea which has been carried into effect is that workmen with outdoor occupations are ordered to wear slouch hats against the sun instead of the hitherto universal 'Auhlefi*. 6. having so far had no opportunity of meeting the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I regrst that I am unable by this bag to comment on the political aspects of the journey. 6. Z learn from the Chef du protocol# in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who has just returned from escorting ths Queen to Switzerland, that Her Majesty's journey went off very well and that she behaved as if she /hadhad always been used to European habits. Assad Khan said that the young Valiahd was a fine, handsome young man t much devoted to skating, lawn tennis and motoring; he met his mother at the station and at once took her for a drive at breakneck speed in his own ear. 7.

No. 1. Sir P. Loraine to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 30.) (No. 305.) Sir, Angora, June 23, 1934. I HAVE the honour, with reference to my despatch No. 299 of the 21st June, to inform you that during the Shah of Persia’s visit to' Angora a number of remarkably cordial speeches were exchanged by His Majesty and his Turkish hosts. 2. At the dinner given by the President of the Republic on the evening of the 16th June, the day of the Shah’s arrival, Gazi Mustafa Kemal, addressing His Majesty as ‘ f Sire, my Great Friend and August Brother,” continued as follows :— 11 The joy which I feel in welcoming to Turkey the illustrious chief of the sister nation is great indeed. The whole Turkish people rejoices in the visit of your Imperial Majesty. “ If the history of Turco-Persian relations is looked into, it becomes manifest that these two peoples have encountered the most difficult crises in their existence each time they turned aside from the way of mutual friendship, whereas they were strong and prosperous whenever they strengthened the bonds of friendship in accordance with their natural inclinations and higher interests. The Turkish Republic, fully alive to this fact, has made of the Persian friendship one of the basic principles of its policy; and it is because these sentiments and considerations were, thanks to your Majesty’s powerful influence, appreciated at their true value in the country of our neighbours and brothers that Turco-Persian friendship has been established, lasting and unshakable.” 3. The Gazi then referred to the progress that Persia had made under the Shah’s guidance and the great works which had been accomplished by the Imperial will. The increase of friendship between the two sister nations was of the greatest benefit to civilisation and humanity. Both nations, whose only aim was progress in peace, considered it a glorious duty to serve the cause of universal concord. 4. The Shah, addressing the “ Glorious President of the Turkish Republic, Dear Brother and Great Friend,” replied as follows :— ” I am deeply touched by the cordial sentiments and the warm welcome with which I was received by the Turkish State and people as soon as I arrived in your country, as also by the affectionate words which you, my Dear Brother, have addressed to me.” (Here followed a complimentary reference to the progress accomplished under the Gazi’s guidance.) “Your Excellency, from the very day on which I took over the direction of the State I have felt the necessity of friendship with Turkey. I see to-day, on this happy occasion, that the relations between Persia and Turkey are cordial in the extreme. Our friendship rests on such solid foundations that it will never be shaken. The two nations, neighbours and sisters, supporting each other with the greatest confidence, will carry out the sacred mission of pursuing progress, spreading civilisation and serving the cause of general peace throughout the world. “ I desire ardently to see you again, Dear Brother, and I trust that your Excellency will find it possible to fill me with joy by honouring Persia f with your visit.” 5. On the occasion of the Shah’s visit to the Grand National Assembly on the 18th June the President of the Council delivered a long speech of welcome, in which he referred to His Majesty as an illustrious chief who personified the love of independence and passion for work which characterised the new [140 gg—2] (vi)2 Persia. The Turkish people, in manifesting its overflowing affection for the Shahinshah, gave evidence of its love of and confidence in the Persian people. Under the administration of their illustrious and powerful chiefs the relations between the two sister nations had become stable and had entered upon a new era. The period of discord and misunderstandings was past. A difference concerning the frontier had existed for more than a hundred years and had poisoned all feelings of confidence between the two States. This difficulty had been surmounted - ' in a comparatively short space, and the whole matter had been satisfactorily settled thanks to the two peoples’ comprehension of their interests and to the wisdom and firm will of the two illustrious rulers. All fomenters of disturbances in the frontier districts had completely lost hope, and order and tranquillity now reigned there supreme. An era of prosperity for the two countries would set in if the present and future generations would only realise that they must seek their higher interest in their common happiness and strength. 6. Turning to economic relations, Ismet Pasha declared that here was a vast and most fruitful field of activity. Turkey and Persia were bound together by their geographical position, and/thanks to the new atmosphere which had been created, the two countries would reap numerous advantages in the economic domain. 7. Turkey and Persia, the Prime Minister added, are very near each other in their ideals and are passing through the same historical phase. Turkey, victorious after a long struggle, fully appreciates the effort being made by the new Persian State, whose whole policy is based on its firm determination to be independent. The securing of progress and the development of science and civilisation constitute a sacred aspiration for their two strong and independent countries. “ For the rest we see that there is an affinity in the life and the tendencies of the two^ peoples, and a marked resemblance in their intellectual and cultural outlook.” Ismet Pasha’s speech ended with an appeal for universal appreciation of the relations uniting the new Persia and the new Turkey, based as they were on noble and humanitarian sentiments and ideas, to the exclusion of all aims but those of progress and peace. 8.

It was also stated by the same informant that during His Majesty’s visit an understanding had been reached for the construction of a railway from Trebizond, by way of Persian Azerbaijan and the Caspian coast, to Herat and Kabul. 3. It was inevitable that the Shah’s first visit to a foreign country should give rise to many rumours, and in view of Tevfik Rttgtti Bey’s categorical assurance that no novel treaties or conventions were under consideration, I am not disposed to give credence to the reports referred to above.

Section 1. [E 4255/776/34] No. 1. Sir P. Loraine to Sir John Simon.—{Received June 30.) (No. 299.) Sir, Angora, June 21, 1934. I HAVE the honour to inform you that Elis Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia arrived at Angora on the 16th June on a state visit to the President of the Turkish Republic. 2. His Majesty, who was accompanied by his Minister for Foreign Affairs, his Grand Master of Ceremonies, the Persian Ambassador in Turkey, and a numerous suite, had reached Giircubulak, on the Turkish frontier, on the 10th June, travelling from Maku, and was there met by representatives of the President, of the Turkish civil and military authorities, and of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He travelled thence by road, in five easy stages, to Trebizond, staying the nights on the way at Igdir, Kars, Erzerum and Gumii§hane. Thanks to the elaborate arrangements made by the Turkish Government, which had entailed months of hard work, not a single untoward incident marked the conveyance of the party, numbering, with Turks and Persians, some seventy persons, with their luggage, across 600 miles of road, the whole length of which had had to be resurfaced, through a remote mountainous and war-stricken district. Some forty motor cars were employed for the purpose and fifteen lorries. Ten cooks and twenty-five waiters had been brought from Constantinople, and, while half their number served the party’s luncheon, the rest went on to the next stopping-place to prepare dinner. At night the Shah slept either in the house of the local Vali or in some private house taken over for the purpose, and in every case the rooms had been specially painted and put in order beforehand. At Trebizond the Shah was greeted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary-General of the President, and from there he was conveyed in the battleship Yavuz (&lt;dx-Goeberi) to Samsun, where a special train was waiting to bring him to Angora. 3. On his arrival at Angora station the Shah was greeted by the Gazi, who then accompanied him in an open car, between lines of onlookers and under a triumphal arch surmounted by the Persian and Turkish flags, to the People’s House (Halk Evi), where His Majesty was lodged during his visit. This building had been specially prepared for His Majesty’s reception, the Gazi himself having spent many hours there, twenty-seven at a stretch on one occasion, superintending the arrangements. A bedroom suite, upholstered in pink silk, had been ordered from Constantinople, but I am told that the luxurious bed was not in accordance with the Shah’s tastes, and that His Majesty preferred to sleep on the floor. Outside, a garden had been made, and trees brought in full leaf from the nearest woods some 60 miles away, while a crop of young barley gave the appearance of a lawn. 4. On the first night of his visit the Shah dined with the Gazi at the presidential villa. Only Turks and Persians were present. The dinner was supposed to start at 8-45, but it was 2 o’clock in the morning before the Gazi and his guests moved into the dining-room, he and the Shah having sat till then conversing and listening to choruses sung by mixed choirs of men and girls, during which time refreshments, liquid and other, were served. Cordial speeches were exchanged during the dinner. On the following day the Gazi, accompanied by the Shah and the Chief of the General Staff, presided over a march-past, on the race-course, of a picked body of infantry, artillery and cavalry, with machine gunners and tanks, and some groups of boy scouts and students. That night the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave a dinner party in the Shah’s honour at the Angora Palace Hotel, to which the heads of missions were invited. The Gazi himself led the dancing at the reception which followed, leaving the Shah, meanwhile, to drink his coffee alone on the presidential dais. The Shah left the party early, but the Gazi remained playing poker till after 10 o’clock in the [140 gg—1]morning. I have reported in my telegram No. 5, Saving, from Constantinople on my conversation with his Excellency towards the end of this protracted vigil. The next night the Shah entertained the Gazi to dinner at the Persian Embassy, and a reception followed, to which the Diplomatic Corps were invited. A brand new road had shortly before been built to replace the uneven track which hitherto had been the only approach from the main road to the Embassy, and the Embassy itself, a unique example of Perso-neo-German architecture, was brilliantly and very effectively illuminated. The afternoon of the next day the Shah and the Gazi and a large gathering, including the Diplomatic Corps, attended a performance of a musical play specially written for the occasion. The play, which is hailed as the first national opera, was well done and effectively staged. It depicted, in pseudo-Wagnerian style, and with much bathos, the twin origin of the Persian and Turkish nations, their subsequent estrangement as a result of the machinations of the Evil One, and their present and lasting reunion brought about by the two great national leaders. 5. The Shah left Angora by train for Smyrna on the 20th June with the Gazi, and, after a visit of some three days to that neighbourhood, they intend to go by sea to Constantinople in the Yavuz. The Shah will return to Persia via Trebizond. 6. I am reporting separately on the political aspects of the visit. Speaking generally, it appears to have been an unqualified success. The functions were well organised and the police arrangements excellent. The Shah, though silent and rather shy-looking at times, appeared to go through a strenuous programme with unruffled temper. Moreover, a natural friendship seems to have sprung up between him and the Gazi, and each appeared to find genuine pleasure in the other’s company. 7. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. I have, &amp;c.
