It has done good service and has still considerable life in it,but I feel strongly that if it is possible to get a suitable ritish car and,more important still,to obtain good service locally,it is desirable for me,as the British Represent ative (known as the Political Agent) here,to have one. Indeed, it is not v/itheut some feeling of shame that I,as British Representative,drive up to the American Company’s Oil Camp in an .American car,and I know that tne fact has been the subject of remark* 4. At the same time,it is necessary to admit that the ordinary American car is excellently suited to rough conditions,and that in general terms ser/iee and spare parts can be got all over Asia,while,at any rate till recently,there has been almost no alternative but to buy an American car* 5# The conditions in Bahrain are that the country is flat and the roads are simply tracks on sand and stones. It is very hot in the hot weather and comparatively cold in the cold weather. The atmosphere is very humid and the salt in the soil and in the sea air corrodes metal very' rapidly. This is especially the case after rain (of which we fortunately do not get much) when the mud splashed upon the car sets up corrosion very rapidly.6* i have been in communication with your local \gent|” , r* Yusif bin Abdul Kahman Fakhroo,and I think that he is anxious to &gt;ush the sale of orris cars,but I do not suppose that he will be able to carry any appreciable stock or spares unless he receives assistance to that end from the Company* It is desir- abl^that there should be spare parte available,as to get them from Bombay or Karachi would entail long delays. 7. \nother problem which presents itself is the fact that such drivers as are obtainable locally do not as a rule know anything of the ‘.'Orris car. ould it be possible to make some arrangement for tuition? 8. ro return to the particular matter of a car for the Political gent. I feel that, it is useless to obtain a ritish car unless I can he certain,firstly,that I can get spare parts should they be required and,secondly,that I can get a driver who will not let • the car down. in this country anything done by the Political Agent is the subject of discussion by everybody,and as his car bears the Jnion Jack instead of number plates,it is obvious at all times to whom it belongs. 9. .ould it be possible for the Company (a) to consider arrang ing with its local \gent to carry a good selection of spare parts, and (b) to help towards the success of the experiment of having a iritish car for the Political Agent by allowing me to have my (/ ^** 1 * trained by the leading Morris Agsnt in Bombay or Karachi. l feel that,if it were to be made clear that you attach import- a/ice to his training,it would be well done. I could arrange for tne driver to be free for a month,or possibly two months,in the hot weather, if these two points could be arranged,! think that there would be a good chance of making a success of turning over to a British car. } ^ Yours Sinoorely,. ’ 1 — V ! m- TELEPHONE N° 7101 COWLEY, (OXEDRO) TELEGRAMS 'VOITURETTE': COWLEY, OXFORD \z BY appointment TO H R.H.THE PRINCE OF WALES.

I have the honour to request that a Government motor car may be provided for the Political Agency, Bahrain. 2. I am aware that it is unusual for a Government car to be supplied to an Agency, but the conditions in Bahrain are exceptional. 3. Circiuastances have entirely changed in Bahrain in the last few years# When I v/as here before, there were no care in the Island, official calls were paid on the Shaikh^ famous white donkeys, lent for the occasion, visits to other parts of the Island involved camping, and the Shaikh himself lived in H'liharraq, a short distance away by boat. Nowadays, cars are a commonplace among the members of the Kuling Family and the more wealthy merchants, and calls are invariably paid in them. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin *Isa Al Khalifah, Ruler of Bahrain, has now definitely taken uphie abode at Sakhir, some 16 or so miles from infrequently at Rumaithah, which is 27 miles is about 16 miles away* I'anamah and is not away* The Oil Field 4. I would especially draw attention to Tiis Excellency Shaikh Hamad having taken up his residence so far away, for our position hore dopends on the Political Agent being in close personal touch, and personal friendship with trie Teller* This has always been the case^but is more than ever so now that important foreign interests have been established, and that the Air Route to India passes through Bahrain* 5* Apart from personal visits to the Ruler, the Political Agent has to atten^/the Senior Joint Court (that of the Ruler and the Political Agent), meetings of the Man amah Municipality, and on ^d days to pay a heavy round of official calls, all of which Lust be done by car* 3* There Is n increasing call on the Political Agent f s hospitality and it is frequently necessary for him to place his car at the disposal of guests (almost without exception entertained , for official reasons), who cone to stay &amp;t the Agency or who come on shore on business, and for whom courtesy demands that the Political .Agent’s car shall be sert* 7* Some guide tc/mileage of the Political Agent’s car can be nau xrom one 2 .act chat the car, whicli I took over fro/i my predecessSB has done over 9000 miles in three years, but I should explain that those three years do not show the full effect of His Excellency Shaikh Hamad’s decision to live permanently at S akh ir or the establishment of the Oil Field* 3# 1 would emphasize that, 'the use of 'the eai* is almost, entirely confined to official business, or to conveying official guests. ■S* 1 fn-r I'm n iWf.. ijin, , f ( m l-c*. , in the -past six months, I can say with certainty thatg have used it for my private purposes only on a few occasions to go out to dinner and once or twice to take a private guest to see the Tombs and the Oil Field. Private guests as opposed to those entertained m the political Agent's official capacity are very rare. Some idea of the entertaining at Bahrain may be had from the fact that during |during ~he period from my arrival in Balirain “to r^y proceeding 'to Bushire to officiate for you ? that is Just over four months, 532 guest-meals were served in the Agency, of which practically none were for private guests# 9# in a place like Bahrain, it is difficult to dispose of a car, and, should an officer's successor have a car of his own, the out-going* officer would be confronted by a considerable loss, and it seems hardly fair to expect an officer to shoulder a loss on a car required^ almost entirely by his official duties# 10# fhere is a farther consideration of an unusual, but important character# t'he Bahrain Petroleum Company have good cars, all *iT Ame^icar, and it is desirable that the British Representative shall use a British car, and cno which will redound to the credit of the British motor industry. It has co.-e to rry knowledge that the American personnel of the Oil Company have remarked in public with acid humour on the British Representative driving up in an American car. it is undesirable that any opportunity for disparagement, however petty it may seem, should bo afforded to a foreign interest. 11. To sum up the Political Agent has to keep a car, which ia used almost exclusively for official purposes| the conditions are such that if he obtains a good class of car, he must face the possibility of a considerable loss} it is desirable, particularly owing to the development of foreign interests, that he fchould have a reliable and dignified car, and essential that it should bo a British car. In all the circumstances, I trust that the principle of the provis on of a car for the Political Agency, Bahrain will be accepted. 12# I would propose the purchase of a 20 h#p.

The journey to and from Bombay takes some ten or twelve days each way, so that he will have approximately one month in Bombay. He has already some knowledge of motor car mechanics but I should be glad if you would:- (a) rub up his knowledge of repairs,and (b) teach him how to set rid of rust,both on the springs and chassis and also on the paint work,and retouch up the effected spot*. 2. I should like him to have as complete a course as possible in the working of a Baimler twenty Horse Power,sleeve valve car with a fluid wheel. 3. Will you kindly let me know whether you can take him on for one month from approximately the 1st September 1933 with a view to his doing the above,and also let me know what your charges will be. He will make his own arrangements for food and lodging. Yours faithfully. Political Captain.

Simla, the 15th July 1912 RESOLUTION The Gtovernment of India have, for some time had under consideration the question of framing rules to regulate (a) the purchase and maintenance of motor cars supplied at the public expense for the use of Grovemment officials other than heads of provinces and administrations, and ('b) the grant of travelling allowance to officers using such cars. The matter was referred to a departmental committee; and after careful consideration of the Committee^ report the Government of India, with the approval of the Secretary of State, are pleased to issue the rul ® appended to this resolution for the information and guidance of local Governments and Administrations. 2. The Government of India have decided not to lay down any general rules on the following points until some experience has 'been gained of the operation of the rules now publisheds- (1) the insurance of carsf (2) the valuation of cars on change of incumbents; (3) the submission of periodical reports of the mileage run by a car, as compared with the mileage for which travelling a Howance is claimed, as a check on any excessive use for private purposes; (4) the regulation of the grant of conveyance allow ance to officers to whom oars are supplied at public expense, mainly for use at head quarters . Gommunicated (together with a copy of the Depart-^ mental Committee’s report) to all local Governments and Administrations; the several Departments of the Govern ment offM ?£ (including tbe Military Finance Branch); toe beads of Departments subordinate to the Finance Department; tbe Comptroller and Auditor General; all Accountants General and Comptrollers; all Examiners and Government Examiners of Bailway Accounts; tbe n /? f Account s, Military Works Services; and tbe iUidit Officer, Temporary Works, Delhi. By order, etc., /-s Sd/- H. F. Howard, Offg. Secretary to tbe Government of India.HCJL3S FOB THE PUBCHASE AND MAINTENAI^CE OF MOTOB CABS AT THE PUBLIC EXPENSE FOB THE USE OF GrOVBBHMENT OFFICERS OTHEB THAN HEADS OF PBOVINCES. I• The supply of a motor car at tbe public expense to a Government officer reauires tbe previous sanction of tbe Secretary of State. Sucb supply will be allowed only in exceptional cases and on very strong grounds* It is not sufficient to show merely that tbe performance of an officer’s duties will be facilitated by tbe grant of a car; and, in submitting a recommendation to tbe Government of India, a Local Government or Administration should clearly justify tbe necessity for tbe supply* II. Tbe following are tbe conditions governing tbe use of a motor car wbiob bas been supplied to a Govern ment officer at tbe public expenses- (i ) No person shall be peraittea to drive tbe car who does not possess tbe certificate of aulification pres cribed by tbe Local Government for tbe purposes of these rules* (ii) A Local Government may permit tbe officer to make a reasonable use of tbe car for private purpose. Sucb permission will, however, apply only to ordinary movements within tbe Officer’s station; and in no case shall tbe car be used on long runs for recreation or lent to others for private use. (iii) Charges for tbe maintenance and upkeep of tbe oar will be borne by tbe Government and oy tbe officer respectively, in tbe manner indicated below, tbe general principle being that tbe officer using tbe car rt shall dependent as regards amount on carefulness of management and which affect tbe continued efficiency of tbe cari- (a) The officer using tbe oar shall pay tbe cost bear those of its running expenses which ofof petrol, tyre renewals, minor repairs and r enewals, lubricants and illuminants, as well as all occasional storage charges and all petty charges incurred otherwise than at the periodical overhauling and annual varnishing of the car. NO^fi. Minor repairs and renewals are those which cost less than Rs. 50/- or are not connected with the prescribed periodical overhauling: Provided that if a new component costing more than Bs. 15 is used in connection with a minor repair or renewal, the officer shall 13 6 entitled to charge to (Government its actual cost 'but not any workshop charges on account of the examination of the defective car and the setting up of the new part. (■fa) All other charges shall 'be paid toy the ' Government including wages of chauffeur and cleaner, the cost of uniform of the chauffeur, and all charges incurred in connection with the annual varnishing and the periodical overhauling. (iv) The officer will toe expected to toes tow the same amount of aareful supervision on the car as he would do in the case of his private car. All oases of damage or accident involving repairs (other than 'minor - repairs) or involving claims toy third parties must toe promptly reported to the controlling authority. Local Governments will further frame detailed rules as to the authority which may sanction expenditure on such repairs. The officer will toe held personally responsible for any damage which may toe caused to the car toy negligence, or toy rough or careless handling or toy accident due to these or similar causes. It will toe for the Local Government to determine in each instance how far this responsitoility shall toe enforced. A similar liatoility to toe enforced at the discretion of the Local Govemmait in each case will rest upon officers in respect of third partyr&lt; party claims« III. Controlling officers will take steps to see that the aftove rules are generally observed. If in any case it is found that the privilege of the reasonable use of the motor car for private purposes is systematically abused or any of the other rules is constantly infringed, the matter should be reported to the .Local Government which will take such disciplinary action against the officer concerned as it considers desirable and may deprive him of the use of the car. IV. Bach Local Government will maintain a register of the mileage run from month to month by the various cars supplied to officers under its control and will, for this purpose, obtain a monthly report from the officers concerned, showing the readings of the milometers attached to the cars. V. The travelling allowance of an offieer to whom a motor oar is supplied under these rules will be Kg regulated by the ordinary rules in Part XX of the Civil Service .Regulations and not by special rule I (b) under Article 999 of those Begulations, provided tbat- (a) if an officer travels more than twenty miles by Govemmoit motor car in a day. he will draw for the first twenty miles toe mileage allowance ordinarily admissible under the Begulations and for the remainder three-fourths of the mileage allowance admissible; the mileage f or tb e fi rs t of the Journey (b) if a journey by Government motor car is combined with a road Journey by ordinary conveyance, the officer so travelling will draw allowance ordinarily admissible twenty miles or for the portion performed by ordinary conveyance, whichever is greater, and for the remainder three-fourths of the mileage allowance so admissible; (c) if a journey by road, wholly or partly by the /motor car, is combined with a journey by rail or steamer, the officer so travelling will draw the allowances admissible under Article 1065 (iii) of the Civil Service Begulations modi fied in respect of the road journey, whether made by the motor oar or otherwise, with reference to rules 5(a) and 5(b) of these rules; (d) the travelling continue to be Article 999 of allowance regulated the Civil of chauffeurs will by rule I(J) under Service Begulations.' 'Mr, H fi VI* Officers to whom at the date on which these rules come into force motor cars have been already . supplied at Government expense will continue to use them on the existing terms and subject to the provisions of rule I (h) under Article 999 of the Oivii Service Regulations, until the cars now used 'by them have 'been worn out. The use of new cars supplied after such date to such officers will be regulated strictly in accordance with the rules now promulgated.

A case lately occurred in which an officer after drawing a motor car advance from the Treasury died without executing the 'Agreement'.

The motor car was exported from India on my transfer from firanshah to Bahrain within six months of my landing in India (from Aden) and the Customs authorities at Karachi have, therefore, refunded the amount through my Bankers, I should be grateful if the remittance could be acknowledged in due course.

British Agency, Sharjah, 3rd September 1^36 I To Ml The Political Agent, BAHRAIN Sir, With reference^to paragraph 3 of your Memorandum No. C-27^-3/9 dated the 3rd June 1936. 2. The hiring of a launch is an expensive arrangement. r v On my transfer to Sharjah I brought a launch with me from Bahrain, but I find it exceedingly difficult to meet its expenses. The pay of the Nakhuda and the crew is Rs. 160/- per mensem, hire of the launch is Rs. 60/- p.m. plus the running expenses. I propose, subject to your concurrence, to send back the launch to Bahrain. There is only one launch it ja in Sharjah which belongs to the Shaikh and if he happens to go out or lets his launch to others, as he often does, then I have no conveyance whatsoever to move from my headquarters. The launch belonging to Khan Sahib Husain is lying on the beach at Dubai and is out of order. I enclose a comparative statement of launch hire and car hire charged locally. 3. Since my appointment here I have experienced considerable difficulties to arrange for a conveyance when I had to perform official journeys to interior, has al Khaimah, Aerodrome and Dubai etc., at a short notice. There j is only one car in Sharjah belonging to the Shaikh of Sharjah and I have entirely to depend on it. This car is not in good condition and there is every possibility that it might break at any time euid my activities would seriously suffer. 4. Sharjah is connected by road to Has al Khaimah, Ajman, Hira, Umm ui Quwain and Dubai and car can easily go to these-places. The road between Dubai and Abu Dhabi is under consideration and it is hoped that cars will ply between these two places within few months time. Under these circumstances motor car is a quickest, cheapest and convenient mode of transport for me to perform my duties efficiently and I request that you would be kind enough to recommend me to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for an advance of the cost of a Motor car which is admissible to me under C.A.C. I will repay the amount in 56 equal monthly instalments. I beg to remain, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, 6HARGAH/ 0. 13. Office of the Political Agent, v llalirain* Karachi ?

Dear Sir, In reply to the query from the Resident Agent Sharjah, we should be obliged if you would inform him that the largest tyre that he can fit to his present wheel is the 7.00-16. The fitment of a 7.50-16, which would necessitate new wheels, would not be satisfactory but if he so desires, it would be possible to convert the vehicle to 7.50-15 tyres and wheels. In view of the fact that the Agent is using his car over sandy desert, we strongly advocate his converting his car to 9.00-13 equipment. Here again new wheels would be required. We suggest that he contacts the Bahrein Petroleum Co., who we think will have no objection to giving him full information as to the service they have obtained from this type of equipment. Delivery can be made to Bahrein approximately six weeks from the receipt of his order.
