With regard to the fact that you have been instructed to examine in detail the question of Khor Ghanadhah, I submit my reply as follows 1) Khor Ghanadhah has no known history. Since the time Al-Maktum becdme rulers of Dubai. Nobody claimed the possession of Khor Ghanadhah before us. Dubai»s claim to Khor Ghanadhah is an old one and the following events which took place during the past 50 yea’s substantiate that beyond any doubt and give Dubai the right of its possession. !• About 50 years ago, when Shaikh Kashid bin Maktum was Puler of Dubai and Shaikh Zayid bin Khalifah was Ruler of Abu Dhabi and Abul-Qasim al-Kanguni was British Residency Agent, a batteel (sailing boat) belonging to NJwaid, a subject of Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah al-Qasimi, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, was plundered at Khor Ghanadhah. He (the owner) complained to the Residency Avent who addressed Shaikh Zayid bin Khalifah, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, on the subject. The latter excused himself and said that the matter was one that concerned Dubai and that it (Khor Ghanadhah) was in Dubai territory. Thereupon Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, contacted Shaikh • • Reshid bin Maktum, the then Ruler of Dubai, who recovered what he could from the looted proporty and paid compensation for what was lost. to 2. 19 years ago a boat belonging/Bahrain people sank near Jarf which lies on the eastern bank of Khor Ghanadhah. The boat was loaded with a cargo belonging to ituhammad bin Abdul Aziz al-Ajaji, a subject of King Abdul Aziz bin Sa»ud, and to other merchants. The cargo was looted and Mohammed bin Abdul Aziz al Ajaji put in a complaint to the late shaikhAbdullah bin liluwi, Amir of Hasa, who sent to me a special messenger named Said al-Faisal, claiming that the incident took place in my territory. I forfeited Rs.5000/- for the loss. 15 years ago a diving-boat, belonging to Abdullah bin Said bin Ghalib, a subject of mine, took shelter at Khor Ghanadhdh. Muhammad bin Nasir Bu Gbai al-Mansuri and his men attacked and fired at the crew. A slave of Buti bin Abdullah bin Bilailah one of m rr subjects was wounded and consequently died. I sent a messenger to Shaikh Shakhbut, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, demanding punishment of the assailants. Shaikh Shakhbut shrinked the responsibility saying that the incident took place in my territory and that Bu-Gbai was a Shaikh and was in a position to give a pledge for himself and his men. Bu-Gbai, however, came to me and apologised for the fault he had committed within my territory and I accepted his apology. 5. The events narrated in the above 4 paragraphs for which Dubai was held responsible decide the fact that Ghanadhah is part of my territory and is my own property. right to its possession is quite clear and on this ground I base my legitimate claim. After I had granted an oil concession, Shaikh Shakhbut, Ruler of Abu Dhabi, alleged that Ghanadhah was within his territory. The late Shaikh Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hilal al- Dhahiri, a subject of Abu %abi, mediated with a view to adjusting the boundaries from the sea side and compensating me from the land, but while I was leaving Shaikh Shakhbut gave me a letter defining his and my boundaries but renounced the limit which he compensated me from the land side. As this constituted a breach of the settlement reached through Shaikh Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hilal aid: every thing remained as it was before. / 7. In support of what I have claimed above, I append herewith a copy of a statement made by Khalifah bin Abdullah bin Said bin Saif al- T TJwaid and Hamad bin t Ubaid bin Hamad bin Saif waid, subjects of Ras al Khaimah, and Abdur Rahman bin Abdullah bin Lutah of Ajman in respect of the incident of the batteel/-batteel (sailing boat). As regards the incident of the boat of Bahrain peonle, enquiries can be made from Al-Ajstji and also from Abdullah ash-Shaiji. As regards the incident of the boat of my subjects a copy of their statement is attached. Bu-Gbai and his men are in Abu Dhabi and I have not got in touch with them in order to talce their statement and submit it to you.

Khalifah bin Abdullah bin Said bin Saif al-’TJwaid al-Mahairi and his cousin Hanad bin ’TTbaid bin Hamad bin Saif al-HTwaid al-Mahairi appeared before me and I asked them to give a true account of what had happened to the bitteel (sailing boat) of Abdullah bin Said al ’UWaid which the bedouins had plundered in Khur Ghanadhah in the time of Shaikhs Zayid bin Khalifah, Rashid bin Maktum and Humaid bin Abdullah bin Sultan. They said: 'Yes, we heard the late Abdullah bin Said al-’Uwaid, during his lifetime, saying as follows:- 'In a certain year we went out for diving by our bitteel. The bitteel received some damage and we entered Khur ffiianadhah and had it repaired. At night the Manasir and some of the Saba f is attacked us and robbed our pearls, and took away some slaves and the gear of the boat. We, therefore, went to Shaikh Humaid bin Abdullah al-o,asimi and complained to him. He sent us to Zayid bin Khalifah and Rashid bin Maktum through Abul Qasim, the Residency Agent at Sharjah. Zayid bin Khalifah declined to have anything to do in the matter and said that our case concerned Rashid bin Maktum. We went to Rashid bin Maktum and approached him on the subject. Rashid took necessary action against the plunderers and recovered what they had stolen from us, and gave it back to us, with the exception of the pearls which vanished in the hands of the plunderers' This is all what Khalifah and his cousin Hamad al- T Uwaidiyin had heard from their father Abdullah al-*TJwaid, the person concerned in the case which is now over fifty years old, recorded for you.

I understand that in 1937 when you met the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to come to an agreement regarding the boundary between your respective territories, it was agreed that the Dubai boundary should start from Bundar Hisyan and thence follow a line due south leaving all country on the west of this line to Abu Dhabi. T also understand that the Sheikh of Abu Ihabi gave you a letter confirming the settlement which you opened after leaving Abu Dhabi. In this letter I understand the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi described the boundary as .running from Bandar Hisyan to Ghafat -ar-Rimaq and thence east. I further under stand thst you did not agree that this description of the boundary was in accordance with that agreed upon at the actual time of settlement. 3. In this connection I would' request you to supply the ♦ x » \ following information:- (a) Is my brief accout. of what transpired correct? Please ^ive a detailed account of what transpired at the time of your meeting with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi.

If it was agreed that the boundary should run south from Bander Hisyar, how far south was it agreed that this should extend? If it was agreed that the boundary should nun south from Bandar Hisyan, did this leave Khor Ghanadhdh rr • iwithin Abu Dhabi territ;ory?

After Compliments, T write to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.222 dated the 23rd of February 1946 corresponding to the 20th of Rabi I, 1365 regarding the meeting which I and the Ruler of Abu Dhabi had in 1937 with a vew to reaching a settlement on the auestion of the boundary between our respective territories. The meeting which T had at that time with the Ruler of Abu Dhabi was not one in which matters and questions could be settled since after we had paid short session, during which we did not deal with any question, he (the Ruler of Abu Dhabi) left me and did not return again. T ~nifced for him for fairly long time in order to discuss with him the question of the boundary, and following is an account of what had taken place (a) The late Shaikh Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hilal was the person - ho mediated between me and the Ruler of Abu Dhabi. He suggested to fix the boundary from the west end of Ras Hisyan running south towards dhafat-ash-Shu f ib up to Ansuriyah; leaving all the area on the west of this line within Abu Dhabi territory. I agreed with him on this and he left me and went to talk over the matter with Shaikh Shakhbut,(the Ruler of Abu Dhabi ) and his brothers. They held a conference but kept quite for a long time. As T became Impatient for this undue delay, I informed them accordingly but they requested me to wait further. Then they gave me a letter the contents of which I did not know. Thereafter I left and when I opened the letter, I found that the terras agreed on with Shaikh Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hilal had been turned down. I disapproved this and wrote a letter to Shaikh Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hilal informing him that I repudiated the settlement contained in his (Ruler of Abu Dhabi’s) letter, which I had enclosed it therewith* The actuall agreement was, therefore, not concluded. (b) Bandar Hisyan lies west of Jabal Ali and east of Khor (ihanadhah. (c) G-hafat-ar-Ramaq is situated east of Bandar Hisyan and2 zJJ i*] south of Jabal Ali. (d) The boudary agreed upon was to run from the west end of Ras Hisyan to Ghafat-Sha'aib south and thence to Ansuriyah. (e) If the bou&amp;ary were to start from west ead of Has Hisyan to the south ; Ghanadhah would be within Abu i^habi^ territory, (f) Khor Ghanadhah would be in Abu Dhabi f s territory, were the boudary to start from Hisyan to Ghaf&amp;t-ar-Ramaq. (g) In view of whet has been narrated at paragraph 1 above, T could not accent the description of the boundary by the Ruler of Abu Dhabi. Every thing therefore remained as before.

Four yeai*s ago he appointee four guards to protect the ‘Gumi* trees at khor Ghanadhah ana prevent the crews of boats putting into the khor from cutting them.

I* enclose two tabulated statements of the claims of both parties which I have compared and marked according to the value of each claim made. The result leaves no room for doubt that the Khor Chanadhah is in iibu Dhabi territory. . Tile Political Officer, Trucial Coast, the Residency agerlt and myself are all agreed that it would be* better not to announce a decision, .amongst the reasons x or this are that both Shaikhs know perfectly well in vdiose terrioorv the Khor lies, and also because a decision on the owneiship Ox tiie Khor does not advance the settlement of the boundary dispute since the probable boundary lies considerably to the north of the Khor. Further, 1 think until we know which area will become of importance due to the discovery of oil we need not enter into interstate ooundary disputes, vie should do this only in connection with a pre-determined policy. 3. It is possible, however, that the Shaikh of Abu^Dhabi may raise the question when he will be entitled to a direct answer. If he does so I suggest that he may be told that we are in no doubt that the Khor lies within his territory. The Shaikh of Dubai could be told the same, though he is not likely to raise the question.

Copy of letter No. TSA.2/4885, dated the 30th April, 1947, from the Manager, Messrs, petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd., to the Political Agent, Bahrain. In continuation of our DO. No. TSA.2/4768 dated the 6th March, 1947. We understand from our Lodnon principals that they have been in correspondence with the India Office on the question of boundaries between the various Shaikhdoms on the Trucial Coast. Our principals took the view'-that boundaries should be settled prior to drilling or other intense activity which could reveal to the Shaikhs the position of potential oil fields. It is understood that the India Office prefer not to undertake a general boundary demarkation but would prefer to limit rulings to cases of possible dispute. 2. We consider a case in point has now arisen between Abu- Dhabi and Dubai. Geo-physical work this season 1946-47 indi cates two separate potential oil fields, both partially in dis puted territory, and it is highly desirable to establish owner ship before intensive work next season reveals the Company's interest in the disputed area and gives the Shaikhs ideas on its value to them. Actually for the next two seasons geo-physical and seismic work will, in all probability, be concentrated on the Abu-Dhabi side, which may be expected to intensify and extend Dubai claims. 3. Our geologists have put forward an idea that in certain circumstances, where at all feasible and where a disputed area lends itself to it, the boundary line could with advantage be drawn on a geological basis, thus avoiding the splitting of an oil field Involving the Company in all the evils attendant upon such a situation. Such evils could easily include prolonged litigation in connection with oil royalties, or hostilities between Shaikhdoms or tribes. The geologists further state that these circumstances apply in the Dubai Abu-Dhabi area, and that the red line on the attached map, by a useful coincidence, both separates two potential oil fields in the area Jabal Ali south-westward to Khor Ghanadah, and divides approximately centrally a disputed territory, (provided the Company^ information on the disputed territory is correct). A line drawn elsewhere it Is believed would split a structure or potential oil field. 4. We have been instructed by London to approach you locally with a view to obtaining a ruling on the boundary between Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the disputed area, and if appropriate we shall be pleased to hear if consideration can be given to the Company's suggestion that the geological factor in this case should be taken into account. As explained above time is short, as next season's geo-physical work will commence in September/October. 5. in conclusion we would make it clear that our use of the term 'potential oil field' should not be taken to mean that oil has been located, but that possible structures exist.1 4 f Copy of political Resident's express letter NO.1400-S dated the 29th July, 1947, to Retaxandum, London, repeated to Political Agent, Bahrain, Reference Hay's letter No. 1040-S dated 30th May, 1947, and connected correspondence. Definition of the boundary bet ween Dubai and Abu Dhabi. 2. No action can be taken in this matter until officers are made available for the Gulf to enable Jackson to take up his post on the Trucial Coast. 3. It is, in my opinion, optimistic to hope that the ques tion can be settled in a few weeks; the dispute regarding the boundary has been going on for years and its settlement is likely to take time. An agreement reached at a meeting of the two Rulers in 1937 was abrogated by one party almost immediately afterwards. The abhorrence of the Shaikhs to settle anything at all must be taken into account over this important matter, and while it may be easy enough to get their agreement to make a start the possibility that they may procrastinate, e.g. by calling witnesses from far afield, should not be overlooked. It will, of course, be for the arbitrator to decide on the admissibility of evidence tendered but as the possession of great wjeixxin wealth is at issue due consideration must be given to all evidence either party wishes to call. 4. If agreement is reached the definition of the boundary should be followed immediately by its demarcation in order to prevent either party from backing down on the agreement, a device commonly resorted to on the Trucial Coast. 5. If either party enquires whether the definition of the boundary is connected with the question of oil - and there is every probability of such enquiry being made - I think there should be no question but that both parties must be so informed in order to forestall a possible complaint later by a dissatisfied party that he has been misled. Stress could however be laid on the necessity for the definition of the frontier from the point of view of the fixing of the responsibility under the concessions for the safety of working parties, rather than on the possible presence of oil. 6 . It should be appreciated that if the two Rulers agree to accept the award of the arbitrator H.M.G. will have to be prepared, if necessary, to enforce the award by the application of sanctions or other methods which may suggest themselves. This would be a departure from the long-standing policy of non-interference on land, but owing to oil developments on the Trucial Coast the time has come when a change in policy is unavoidable. /7. Finally7. Finally in view of our responsibility towards these Rulers, and of the immense benefits that will accrue to the Ruler and people of a State in which oil is found, it seems essential that the boundary line should be determined without regard to geological factors except where taking them into account would not cause gain to one party at the expense of the other. Fo give greater weight to geological factors, as suggested by the Oil Company, would not be compatible with our obliga tions to these Rulers.CONFIDENTIAL.

Please refer to India Office endorsement no. Ext. 1060/47, dated the 14th May, 19*17. 3. I enclose a copy of a letter received by the political Agent, Bahrain, from the Manager, petroleum Development (Trucial Coast), limited, from which it will be seen that it is desirable to take immediate steps for the definition of the boundary between Abu Dhabi md Dubai. There will be some difficulty about this owing ^o che shortage of officers as nearly all the officers serving in uhe Gulf have to get home this hot weather for interviews and leave. However, T hope it may be possible to send Jackson back to the Trucial Coast for a few *eeks some time before the hot weather ends to settle the matter if possible. 3. I enclose an extract from a letter from pelly on the subject of boundai/T)es on the Trucial Coast. I fully agree with him that the time has come when we ought to have a Political Agent on the Trucial Coast and that the political Agent, Bahrain, cannot properly discharge his present res ponsibilities there especially when for several months in the year there is no British political officer on the Frucial Coast and he has to rely on the Arab Residency Agent. I hope to discuss this matter with you when I come home. 4 . I also thinx before very long we shall have to estab lish some kind of Government force similar to the Aden protectorate Levies on the Trucial Coast. UP to the present control from the sea through His Majesty's sloops in the Gulf has been adequate but with oil development in the offing we must have some force available on land to keep the peace between the petty local Shaikhs who are constantly warring not only with each other but with their own relatives and the more or less independent tribes of the interior.CON FIDENTIAL Copy of demi-official letter No.942-S dated the 16th May, 1947, from the Hon»ble Lt-Col, Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to c.J. Pelly, Esq,, O.B.E., I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. Please refer to your memorandum No. C/557, and your demi-official letter No. c/558, dated the 8th May, 1947. 2. I have consulted Jackson particularly regarding the procedure to be followed and his suggestion is that the Shaikhs concerned should be asked to agree in advance to the appointment of a Government officer as arbitrator and to accept the Residents award as final and binding on them. The arbitrator should then consider the claims made by both parties and the evidence produced in support of them and make recommendations. Jackson thinks the Shaikhs would agree to this procedure and would accept any reasonable award. Jackson's suggestions appear to me at first sight sound and I should be glad to know whether you agree with them. 3. I am not clear why it is necessary to decide the Dubai-Sharjah as well as the Dubai-Abu Dhabi boundary and should much prefer to leave the former alond^for the present. A point which may cause a certain amount of difficulty is the fixation of a western terminal for the Dubai-Abu Dhabi boundary. 4. I sympathise with your request for a political Officer, Trucial Coast, especially if Jackson's suggestions regarding procedure are adopted. I propose to discuss the question in Delhi but am not very optimistic. I expect Pettigrew back here by the 15th June and it might be possible to send Jackson back to the Trucial Coast for a few weeks then.SECRET. POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 13th December, 1947. D.O.

It is this Company’s intention to send a Seismic Party to the Trucial Coast in early October, and the first area to be surveyed will be from Jabal Ali southwards. 3. As this area is on the boundaries of both Abu Dhabi and Dubai and includes an area claimed by both Shaikhdoms, we shall be greatly obliged if you will inform us whether any agreement has been made to determine the boundary. 4. Should an agreement not be made before the commencement of our seismic operations, we foresee very serious difficulties for the smooth running of the Party’s work which will be concentrated in the disputed area, and once the seismic work has started it is our opinion that a solution to the dispute will be much more difficult to find. Yours faithfully, For &amp; on behalf of PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (TRUCIAL COAST) LTD. (SGD) B.H. LERMITTE, Manager.Copy. PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (TRUCXAL COAST) LIMITED D0/DB/PL/702 Dubai, 13th April 1948.

Please be good enough to return the enclosed map, when you have finished with it. G.N. Jackson, Esq., SHARJAH. Yours sincerely, Sd./- H.M. Jackson. C.C. B.H. Lermitte, Esq., Bahrain for information.British Agency, Sv Confidential. Sharjah, D.O.No.358,0630 Dated the 15th April, 1948. My dear Felly, Please refer to your telegram No. 29 of the 11th April, 1948. 2. I have seen the areas that the Company wish their seismic party to survey and ^ermitte is correct in saying that one of them (the one to which they attach most importance) includes an area claimed by Abu Dhabi and Dubai. I am also in agreement with the views he expresses in the last clause of paragraph 4 of his letter to you. 3. If we are unable to bring about a settle ment by October the Company would not necessarily be prevented from surveying the area - they have worked in this area before without incident — ; but it involves their using two sets of guards, which is both expensive and inconvenient. A far more grave objection to this course, however, is that if once the two Shaikhs see that their failure to cooperate with us in reaching a settlement does not necessarily hinder the development of their oil resources one of the most powerful incentives to a settlement will have been lost. 4. It is therefore clearly in our interest to try to reach a settlement before the Company wish to start work; and, if we have not been able to do so by October of this year, it may well be politically desirable that the Company should postpone their operations in this area until the Shaikhs have agreed to our arbitration and accepted our award. 5. You will have seen from the Residency Agent’s telegram No. 306 dated the 3rd April to me in Bahrain that Shakhbut promised, in response to my last reminder, to send his deputation within 20 days. The deputation is due here on the 20th April and if it does not arrive punctually, I will myself go to Abu Dhabi to try to expedite a settlement. Yours sincerely, C.J.
