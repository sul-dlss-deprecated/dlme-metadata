Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S., Bahrain.\ © COPT OONTIDMTIaL Dubai, 10th April, 1938. Dear Packer, I enclose a letter from the Ruler of Ras el Kfcaimh addressed to Hajji Yusef. I would ask you to have a good look at the heading on the envelope. The Ruler has heard that Major Holmes is in Kowait and wants to visit him and try to get better terms; you remember X mentioned in one of my earliest reports that the Ruler pretends that he was promised Kowait terms by Major Holmes. He also wants to accept Hajji Abdullah invitation to stay with him at Basra and perhaps get introduced to another oil Company. At present H.M.G, are not giving travel papers but the Ruler has applied officially for them as he pretends this does not apply to himself. He wants to take three retainers with him. I understand that if he is refused the necessary travel documents he is going to deliver the letter to H.M.G. which incidentally he has already prepared. The letter I refer to is the apology to the Commander of the sloop. His actions are very strange. Tours sincerely, (Sgd.) B.H. Lermitte.GonE iaeiitiaX GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. « k\ Department.

The Company may employ all the means of search and exploration, except boring and drilling. If the Company , after its exploration, wishes to employ any boring or drilling, this shall be governed by a special agreement between the Euler and the Company. The Ruler undertakes to assist the Company and protect its employees and property to the full extent of his ability; but the Company shall have no right to claim against the Euler for any damage in respect of any failure to comply with this obligation. It is to be understood from this that there exist certain districts in the Territory (which would be ) dangerous for the Company, and the Company has no right of entry into these districts except after written notice from the Ruler to the Company that they are no longer dangerous, and this (shall be the case ) even if it involved failure to enter them up to the end of the period of this Agreement.

Ar ®» C/757-10/12.c. noted i.3t.h December 193 8 subject :- Oil Concessions - Trucial Coast as al Khaimah. I have received information that Mr. Longrigg has, on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Limited, obtained an 'Exploration Permit' from the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah for a period of 2. years extendabl to 3 : y years, securing for the Company exclusive ri hts of search and exploration (without drilling), and providing for a subsequent agreement to be made for drilling, exploitation, etce tera, if the Company wish to apply for it after exploration. I f ft attach to this letter a copy of the report' received from Mr. Long rigg and a translation of the agreement. 2. This Exploration Permit does not fully cover the Company's original intention when Mr. Longrigg went to the Trucial Coast this s &lt;s. MPP—400S&amp;P—(M-480)—20-7-34—2,00,000. year/- EHMVMMi~2~ year, Negotiations with the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah were however no easier now than in the past. Mr. Long- rigg has stated that the decision to allow Petroleum Concessions Limited to negotiate direct with the Beni Xitab for a visit to Jebel Faiyah, thus side-tracking the presumptive but impotent suzerain, the Shaikh of Sharjah, has led to some misgiving on the part of some of those Trucial Coast Shaikhs who have not granted con- C cessions to the Company lest any of their own inland tribes ) should similarly renounce allegiance. How far this is correct and how far this particular point is responsible for the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah’s refusal to conclude negotiations for a concession I am not at this stage able to say; though my own suspicion is that the Shaikh has merely sought an excuse to avoid what is to him the repulsive prospect of having to make up his mind finally. The permit nov/ obtained appears to secure for Petroleum Concessions Limited a position of considerable immediate advantage, though they may have cause to regret it if their exploration produces encouraging results and they decide in due course to negotiate for a full concession. 3# Though I was under the impression that it had been accepted unofficially that options, or anything in the nature of an option, were not to be sought, I do not see that any objection need be taken to the present Permit.

(Trucial Coast) Ltd. exclusive exploration rights over his territories for a period of 2 / years, with right to a one year extension. A copy of this Agreement has been sent to the Political Agent, Bahrain. The Shaikh originally granted to the D’Arcy Exploration Company, who transferred it to P.C.L., a 2 year's option which expired on the 1st August,1937. We havo since been ondeavcuring to obtain from the Shaikh a concession on the lines of those obtained from Dubai and Sharjah, but the Shaikh has resolutely refused to sign such a concession at the present time, and it was considered preferable to get him to grant us an exploration permit rather than to leave the territory entirely uncovered. The payments which he is to get under this permit are considerably greater than the payment under the previous option, which amounted to only Rs.9,000 a year. Longrigg writes:- 'It is probable that the time will come within the next 3p- years when the Shaikh will be better disposed to a Concession than he is at present, and the Company can take advantage of . any such opportunity v/ithout having lost anything. On the other hand it may well appear during the period/ *''period that, so woak is the inland hold of the coastal rulers, the Company would after all ho hotter advised to do its business with the inland tribal chiefs (v/hose first step will doubtless be to repudiate all Ras al Khaimah control; direct.” Yours sincerely, (Sd) P.

The SheiJth has tai^en up two points:- (a) Mr. Lermittehas used the phrase ' tark tauwaa^ttan' 1 , to give the idea oi postponement. 1/ Fattening on the word M taric' only, the Sheixh a sited if he was to understand that the Company are abandoning the agreement under £he sixth paragraph* I have, of course, assured him that this is not their meaning, as, of course, he perfectly well knows. He asked if he was now 'free'.- I imagine he merely wants the opportunity to hold out for higher terms next time the Company have to negotiate with him, as I do not think any other interests can have got at himt (b) he also objected to the use of the word 'tanqib', pointing out that the Company never had the right to drill* ox course, the reason must be that the Company put out a standard letter to all the Sheikhs, and overlooked this minor pointj it merely shows that Sh. Sultan is not lett^ing anything go by default. . 3 . I have given him the necessary explanations, but he would appreciate a letter from the Company, formally covering these points.
