The claim relates to a pearl transaction dating from 1926, which was originally brought to the attention of the Political Agent, Bahrain in 1936 by Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahman Zayani of Karachi, a friend of the claimant. Included in the file is a Power of Attorney granted by the claimant to his son Yusuf bin Abdul Latif in Bombay in 1945, to enable him to pursue in the Shaikh’s court in Abu Dhabi or Dubai, the debt judgements already made in his father’s favour by the Bombay High Court in 1939. The main correspondents are the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Residency Agent, Sharjah who investigate the settlement of the debt claim between 1936 and 1939, and then again between 1947 and 1949, in response to further petitioning from Mohamed and Khalid bin Abdul Latif, also sons of the claimant and residents of Kuwait. Two letters and a memorandum by the Residency Agent about an attempted mediated settlement by a committee of merchants at Dubai in 1947, a letter from the Political Agent to Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahman Zayani of Karachi, and two letters from the claimant’s son Mohamed Abdul-Latif Al-Abdul-Razzak, a pearl merchant of Kuwait, are in English and Arabic.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Debt recovery</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Abu Dhabi</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Claims</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000261#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000261#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
