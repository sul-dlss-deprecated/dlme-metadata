The visits of Major General P.Hurley, President Roosevelt*s special representative, and Mr. Eric Beecroft of the U.S.A. Foreign Economic Board in January, aroused consider able interest, and a great deal of speculation amongst officers in the air force. Many Afghan officers thought that the U.S.A. would be asked to supply new aircraft to Afghanistan, and this supposition was reinforced when they found that Mr. Beecroft was making enquiries about the situation in the Afghan air force regarding aircraft, aircraft spares and equipment, W/T equipment, and about financial and economic conditions in the country.y of a Speech by the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs he Foreign Office Dinner for General -Rurley, January 11th, Your Royal Highness, Yourj Excellencies, land Gentlemen: It is with great pieasurJt.sJ offer a most cordial welcome to our esteemed guests in the persons of General Furley and his companions who have honoured us with their presence tonight. I very much wished, General, that you could have had more leisure and had come in warmer weather so that we could have better entertained you and shown to you some of the interesting and historical spots of this land, this ancient home of ours, just to atone for all the trouble you have permitted yourselves to take on this journey. Nevertheless, I hasten to assure you, Sir, that this visit of yours here in the capacity of the special representative of His Fxcellency the President of the United States of America in the Hear East, not mentioning your own great and well-known personality, is most sincerely acknowledged and highly apprec iated by the people of this country, and is tak^n by them as an auspicious token of the establishment of a better mutual understanding and of putting the already existing friendly relations of the two countries on a more solid base. I therefore deem it rny duty to offer to your Government, Sir, our most profound acknowledgments and thanks. I believe it will not be irrelevant to this occasion' if I am permitted to say that seeing a permanent peace established and a sure freedom and prosperity enjoyed by all nations, great or small, has been and shall r»main to be the backbone and the guiding rule of the policy of the Government and the heartfelt desire of the people of this country. I can safely say that on this principle the affairs of this country have been conducted and its obligations have duly been met. We hope that the time will come in which all of us can live in an atmosphere of peace, freedom and harmony, exerting all our human efforts in a true sense of cooperation and sincerity to maintain it. I have no more to say, General, except - if you will permit me - to offer you once again that warmest welcome which the Afghans on such an occasion are privileged to give, and a representative of the President of the United States deserves to receive. Thanking you all Gentlemen for being so kindly patient to listen to ray very poor English, I request you all be pleased to rise and join with me in drinking to the health of General Hurley.A. A. A. COPY EXT. 346/44&gt; SECRET. Extract from Intelligence Summary No. 2, British Legation, Kabul, for •week ending the 14th January, 1944. 4. Visit of President Roosevelts Special Representative to Kabul. Reference Summary No. 1, para. 19. (a) Maj. Gen. Patrick Hurley, President Roosevelts special envoy in the Middle East, arrived in Kabul from India on 8 th January, and was the guest of the Afghan Govt, during his stay. He was accompanied by Major Henry U.S. Air Corps, and Capt. Clarke U.S. Medical Service. Gen. Hurley arrived by car, and his transport aircraft did not reach Kabul until 12th January owing *to unsatisfactory landing conditions and bad weather. Gen. Hurley left Kabul by air on 14th January, for Peshawar. (b) The Afghan Govt, and the Kabul Press appear to have welcomed this visit, and the Govt, made every effort to entertain Gen. Hurley and give him a good impression of Afghanistan. He was given an audience by King Zahir Shah on 13th January, and entertainments given in his honour included Minister for Foreign Affairs. Dinner on 11th January, Minister of Defence. Dinner on 12th January, Deputy Prime Minister. Dinner on 13 th January. (c) Gen. hurley was also entertained by Foreign Missions in Kabul, the engagements including a dinner given by the Persian Ambassador on 10th January, and lunches by the Egyptian Minister, the American Minister, the British Minister, and the Russian Charge d 1 Affaires. (d) The visit was a success, and Gen. Hurley’s frank ness and strong personality impressed Afghan officials. The/The Afghan Govt, are stated to have had suspicions that Gen. Hurley had come to make specific requests regarding supply routes to Russia through Afghanistan, but 'when they found that his visit ■was purely a friendly one, and made without any definite ulterior motives, their suspicions vanished. Amongst many other problems, the following major items are stated to have been discussed (i) Anglo-Afghan relations and the difficulty of placing these on a really fniendly basis. (ii) The supply of arms and Military equipment for the Afghan Army. (iii) The supply of machinery, including motor vehicles and tractors for civil use, and road making etc., (iv) The prospects of U.S.A. oil interests taking up a concession for the exploitation of Afghanistan’s oil resources. (e) Gen. Hurley's visit rather naturally created some excitement in Kafcul, and there were many rumours in the city about the purpose of the visit. The main rumours in circulation included:- (i) that Gen. Hurley had come to persuade the Afghan Govt, to Join the Allied Nations, (ii) that he had come to negotiate an agreement for the construction of railways in Afghanistan, (iii) that the Afghan Govt's permission was required for the use of airfields, by the Americans and the British, (iv) for the purpose of negotiating for the supply of aircraft, tanks, machine guns, rifles and other military equipment to Afghanistan, (v) with the object of arranging for the construction of defence works in Northern Afghanistan, by American and British engineers.Extract from Kabul Intelligence Summary, No. 3. for the week ending 21st January, 19^4. ******* 3.

He had told General Hurley that if they had any complaints against the British Government which they inevitably had, they preferred to register these complaints direct. He further stated that ne had been particularly careful himself, not to make specific requests to General Hurley, but had informed him that Afghanistan required assistance in the development of her resources, and that the U. S.A. could help them. * * * * * * *Ert. 637/19^ SECRET . Extract from Kabul Intelligence Sumnary, No, 3* for the week ending 21st January, 1944* i ******* 3.

C,H,Engert the American minister in Kabul stated (A) during the week that Afghan Cabinet Ministers had not made any fresh proposals for the taking up of an oil concession in Afghanistan by American oil interests during Ceneral Hurleys recent visit to Kabul, but had had expressed their regret that the oil concession formerly held had to be given up in 1938, Also that during General Hurleyfe visit, no specific requests had been made by the Afghan G-ovemment for the supply of war material, arms etc., though there had been some general conversation regarding this subject.EXT.560A4 6 ) Extract from y/eekly Summary No.3 dated IFteshawar, the 15 th January, 1944• £art II ^20. General P-Hurley, American, made a visit to Kabul during the week, he had arranged to travel there by air, but Kabul aerodromes were rendered unserviceable by rain and snow. Three American aircr ft flew to Kabul on 3rd January to see the condition of the aerodromes, but they returned without landing; so he made the journey by road, and stayed at Jalalabad en route. On his way, he was received at the Afghan frontier with a large guard of honour of Afghan gendarmerie sent there from Jalalabad. he arrived in Kabul on 8 th January. On the next day the Foreign Minister entertained the members of the American legation to a dinner given in honour of General Hurley. It is reported that General Hurley was given a house in D&amp;r-ul-Fanun, and that a number of C.I.D. men were posted in the vicinity. Abdul Q,aiyum of the Reception Branch of the Foreign Ministry was in charge of arrangements for General Hurley's visit. The General returned to Peshawar by air on 14th January.uncertain/- Fi FAST AIR MIL. a i u fi Extemsl Affairs Department, o*. Nev« Delhij t&gt; *i 8 The v^- j February, j 1944. D.O.

In these letters General Hurley appears somewhat in the role of the god from the machine, and it is hard to avoid the feeling that those with Y/hom he came in contact in Kabul have been inspired by the divine afflatus. It may be awkward if tne Afghan Government really had the idea that the General was able to give them assurances regarding Russian intentions towards Afghanistan on the lines suggested, and subsequently come to believe that they have accepted these assurances too light-heartedly. It seems to us that Hurley’s handling of these problems was on the crude side, though obviously it was well-intentioned and designed to second Engert’s efforts to impress the Afghans with Anglb-American solidarity. 2. When he was in India Hurley kept on saying that he intended to discuss business matters with the Viceroy and various Departments. He did see His Excellency once, and promised to see him again but failed to turn up, and he practised the same technique with the External affairs Department (and apparently also with Squire), using the excuse that his plans were toof QA . uncertain. If his plans for reaching Kabul are a fair criterion, this is hardly surprising* On his return to Delhi he did not see us again, and his relations with the American Mission ana American Goimiands here seem to have been equally nebulous* Altogether he has given the impression ^ of a picturesque, plausible but not very effective figpre, whose elusive mission may have been designed with objects which have some connection with American internal politics but less concern with the future stability of Asiatic countries* 3* I am sending a copy of this letter to Squire* R.X*Peel.

Copy of secret demi-official letter No. 29-F/43 dated 22nd January 1944 from His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, to the Secret ary to the Government of India in the E ‘ Department, New Delhi. IN To R.T.Peel Esquire, C.B.E., M.C India Office London.SECRET D.0.NO.29-F/43. Hy dfior C^roe, British Legation, Kabul. 22nd January 1944® h It is now possible to amplify m y letter Nq*29 -F/43 of January 14th and to sum up more accurately the effect of General Hurley^ visit to Kabul. It has been wholly good and the Afghan Government are all the more delighted as they were at first apprehensive of what the visit might portend. They are now reassured and far more confident in their outlook on world affairs. 2. Unexpected, and even more welcome from our point of view is the encouragement that the visit has apparently given to Anglo-Afghan friendship. In spite of hindert*s efforts to stress Anglo-American solidarity the Afghan Government have not hitherto been fully convinced of this as a fact and there was at one time a tendency to attempt to play off America against Britain. This was partly no doubt due to the violently expressed hostility to all things British of Mrs.Nila Cram Cook and the pernicious influence which she had over Najibullah Khan the most important personage in the Afghan Foreign Office,(I mi told that the Prime Minister was very angry when he heard of this affair, that in consequence Mrs.Cook was more or less asked to leave the country and that Najibullah ran some risk of dismissal as a result of his infatuation. This however may be mere idle gossip.) but even more to Thayer^ unfortunate personal dislike for Engert and to indiscreet remarks made by him to the effect that Engert cut little ice with the State Department and that his policy was not necessarily that of Washington. (Enders has also been guilty of similar indiscretions though to a lesser extent). The Afghan Government must therefore be given all the more credit for having openly told General Hurley that they of necessity attached primary importance to their friendly relations with Great Britain. Ali Muhammad tells me himself that he had added that wnen they had any complaints against the British Government they preferred to make them to us direct! These lingering suspicions appear now to have been dispelled partly‘by the General^ own assurance of Anglo-American friendship but possibly even more by purely fortuitous cir cumstances. Owing to the fact that he speaks no French or Persian General Hurley naturally found it easier at the various parties at which we met to talk ta myself, (or other members of the British Legation if they were present) ,r a the r than to any of my colleagues and on two occasions he asked Lancaster to act as his interpreter. Also it so happened that at the last luncheon party given at the Soviet Embassy he took me aside for a few moments to give me the resume of XKgXsxX his activities which I reported last week. This did not pass unnoticed or without comment and confirmed the impression of Anglo-American solidarity in Afghan eyes* What a different story we should have had to tell if Roosevelt had selected one of the notorious five senators as his delegate to Afghanistani 3. At his interview with the King on the 13th January General Hurley delivered a message from the President ex pressing his personal friendly feelings and good wishes for the peace, prosperity and independence of Afghanistan; and in its issue of January 16th, the newspaper Anis expressed its gratitude to the President for this message and added that Afghanistan's only desire was to see the world living in peace and freedom end to cooperate with all in a spirit of friendship. It expressed the hope that from the President^ aspirations would emerge a world able to live L peace end harmony prosperity and independence. The article-2 \ is in fact almost identical with the speech made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs at his dinner a few days earlier# 4. I have discussed the visit not only with Engert but also with Ali Muhammad and Sardar Muhammad Naim Khan (the Deputy Prime Minister) and they have all confirmed that General Hurley had no mission other than to pay a courtesy visit in order to express generally the President^ good wishes- As regards the request* made by the Afghans for American assistance I an assured both by Ali Muhammad and Hngert himself that these were couched in the most general terms only. Ali Muhammad purposely confined himself to saying merely that American assistance in the development of their country would be welcome - Naim Khan and Snah Mahmud j Minister of Defence went a little further in mentioning teachers, engineers, and military equipment but no specific demands were apparently made snd in particular no mention was made of aircraft- General Hurley in no way committed himself to promising Americf^i help in these directions, while in the matter of oil concessions he was definitely discouraging# 5. Ger^ral Hurley*s frenkness and friendliness made a most favourable impression on all with whom he came in contact and the Prime Minister whom I saw for a few minutes on Monday when I called to enquire after his health expressed himself as delighted with trie brief accounts that he had so far been given of the visit as giving a real hope of a peaceful future for Afghanistan, secure in the friendship of Great Britain, 1 '^ the sympathy of the U-S.A- and from interference by the U.3.3.R. 6.

H«t he asked, if, haying no '•nft^., he ano his staff might pay their visit to Afehan- thi^thev'^on?^ Whatever the Government may have thought about this v,hey could hardly refuse permission. Finally on ,/onday January 3rd General Hurley's plane made what I understand to have oeen on unannounced and unauthorised reconnaissance of Kabul. I have yet to learn that the Afghan Government have made an official protest against the violation of their territory! 2 * .. . 4 Th f air reconnaissance was in fact of little value as the next day the weather worsened and no landing in Kabul was possible, as a result the General accompanied by J.i&amp;jor Henry and apt © .in vlartce his kedical Officer arrived by car on Saturday evening, having spent the previous night at Jalalabad. Ihey were met outs-u© the town by representatives of the foreign Office and an announcement of their arrival emphasising at some length the friendly relations existing between Afghanistan and the United ■states was broadcast a couple of hours later from the Kabul radio, ^.he party waa acco modated in a house belonging to the Coverm&lt;ent at Da nil Funun and treated as State guests. Lngert was kind enough to invite me to dinner the •veiling to Meet the General and the party came and lunched with me informally the following Monday along with All Kuhammad and my Soviet colleague. But by that time the visit of such an eminent personage seemed to have quite gone to Kabuli head and from then onwards until his departure this morning we indulged in an orgy of large luncheons and dinners all of which, with the exception of a lunch at the Soviet Embassy on Thursday, were either !fP rn ^n£ coats or tall coats. Official lunch parties were given at the American and Egyptian legations and dinner parties by the i ersian Embassy, tne Minister for Foreigz; Affairs, the Minister of bar and the Deputy Prime Minister. The only speech-making was a very brief speech of welcome by the Jiinister for Foreign Affairs at his party on Tuesday to which General Burley re-lied by toasting the King. Except for the Minister of War*s party which was for thirty-five and included a few biilitary officers(with the notable exception of Daud Khan who took no part in any of the functions) the composition of the guests was almost entirely the same at all the parties and it must be admitted that they were «aostly very dull while the unaccustomed surfeit of food caused us to heave a si h 9 of relief when the orgies came to an end. / 1 am yet in a position to report in any detail on the discussions which General Hurley had whilst here, though both Engert and All Muhammad have promised to give me full accounts when next X see them. General Hurley himself expressed a wish to have a talk with me before he left, but as the whole of his last day was more than fully occupied he took the opportunity of our meeting at the Soviet Embassy on the 13th to give me a general outline of his conversations with the Afghan Government telling me that Engert who had been with him on practically ever/ occasion would fill in the details. A:L!. t 5* He had been l-ipres^ed by the repeated statements made by * Afghan officials with whom he had intervlewa that the Afghans could not forget the three Afghan A'ars with the British. At first * he had been somewhat taken aback but after discussing the matter with Engert had replied to later statements that the Americans and the british had also fought with one another but yet neither country now \ had a better friend than the other. Could not the Afghans follow ^ t* \r example ? He had found at first that the Afghans were a little nervous f thinking that he could not have come here without wanting something either in the way of commercial or military concessions to help in the war effort. When however they found that he really had no other object than merely to pay an informal visit on behalf of the President and to assure the Afghan Government of luaorican goodwill and of the friendly interest felt by the President for Afghanistan they aulckly thawed. 7. Their main anxiety was of course their fear of fussia and / Russian intentions. General Hurley himself felt and had told Molotov &gt;/ that the statement on Iran was meant as a criterion which would apply equally to Afghanistan and any other countries similarly situated and he had endeavoured to reassure the Afghan Government in this matter. 8. I asked him whether he could tell me what requests the Afghans j' had principally made and he admitted that they had asked for a lot of v j military equipment such as rifles and especially for lorries and /mechanical excavators for irrigation work. They had also asked for engineers and hsd enquired whether Americans were interested in any oil concessions. They had told him that they were anxious to develop their country and would require assistance in this direction but they were not asking for this as a favour and would pay for any help that they might receive. General Hurley did not tell me what reply he had given about arms and motor vehicles but in connection with the oil concession and other co.’fuaercial enterprises he had said that he was neither authorised to discuss nor was he personally interested in I these natters. The Afghan Government should approach American commer cial concerns direct. Only this much he woul1 sey| the American Government no longer allowed exploitation of weaker countries and took steps to see that cc* cessionaires were not allowed to take unfair advantage of any country in which they were operating. For the rest the Afghan Government must make their own terms. 9. I think that the Generali very friendly attitude and his genuine admiration, freely expressed f for the Red *rmy made a profound impression and certainly my Soviet colleague was delighted. The assurances that General Hurley was eble to vive regarding Russian intentions towards Afghanistan must have been very welcome to the Afghan Government and the emphasis which, under Engert’s tutelage, he laid on British and American unity of outlook cannot but have had a good effect. Besides seeing the minister for Foreign Affairs, the inlster of Defence, and the Deputy Prime Minister, General Hurley was • received in audience by the King on Thursday. He did not however see the Prime Minister, who though better has not yet left his room. 10. The weather improved during the visit and the Generali plane was able to reach Kabul on Wednesday afternoon. It had made an attempt to get here earlier in the morning but had been unable to land owing to the ground mist, and had had to return to Pashawar to refuel. The weather remained fine enough to enable the party to leave by air this morning. 11 .

It will be seen that General Hurley expressed his concern over the security situation in Persia on the grounds that the tribesmen were threatening lines of communication to Russia and that this risked giving to Russia the opportunity of demanding to see to the safety of these communications themselves, and thus of making a further step towards the Persian Gulf to which, some Russian Generals had apparently told Hurley when he was in Russia, it was their aim to gain access. Hurley therefore thought it most urgent that they should supply com£*tent troops in sufficent numbers to protect communications between the Persian Gulf and Russia. It is amusing in the last paragraph of Sir Ronald Canqpbell 1 s letter, to find General Hurley emphasising the importance of our taking steps again^t^ussian encroachment to the Gulf, on the grounds that we' had interests in the Persian Gulf, and Sir Ronald Campbell pointing out that the Americans also had certain interests there. It will be seen that the Foreign Office have now written to R.Bullard asking for his views on the security situation in Soutli Persia in the light of General Hurley^ remarks. It will be remembered that we ourselves have just written to the Foreign Office expressing our misgivings at the way in which the tribal situation in the south is developing^ Afl A &lt;n*. f K'VvwJ $ ^ JtU i\^J.k)r £ &lt;&gt;Kv**vw^*'A'*V7 (k ' \ ^ /^A ' ol u,r ^ ^ t ~' c *'Arr^ uiLU (aa&lt; (Z J- v x.(ru~ J^&lt;w. h ***■«- ° tiu cjUor - It - £ ^ &amp;y\ f(/„(K 6374/2551/65). 77 ^ • | f FOREIGN OFFICE, S.'a. 1. oth NtTrenibcr, 1945, H to NOV 194 S u “V s n /• Q I enclose herewith an extract from a-letter from Ronnie Campbell relating a conversation which he has had with General Hurley, who is paying another visit to the Middle Fast and going very likely as far as China. We do not ourselves believe that there is any substance in General Hurley f s fear that the Russians will take advantage of the alleged insecurity on the railway to occupy South Persia. And it is only fair to ada that one of the principal difficulties about security on the railway at present Is the refusal of General Connolly to co-operate with Persia and Iraq Co mand in arranging for the -necessary inspections of railway equipment etc. and in allowing British troops, who are responsible for preventing sabotage, to have reasonable access to railway installations etc. in order to carry out their duties. This question is under examination in London and Washington by the higher British and United States military organisations concerned. Ye should be interested some time to have your opinion as to whether, and if so, to wh; l extent, uhe failure of the Persian Government to settle the tribal situation satisfactorily in the south involves any lack of security for the railway or the oil installations, e.g. at Gach caran. I gather your opinion is that now that the trioes are no longer in open revolt, the present danger of serious disturbances is less, however unsatisfactory the long-term outloox lor internal security may be, and that, provide'd the question of the Germans with the Qashgai tribes can be disposed of, we might be justifiedin ceasing to take so active an interest in this question. should be very glad to know whether this is really your considered estimate of the position, as there seems to be a good deal of anxiety on the subject both in India and in the minds of the Americans. v / J (C.W. Baxter). Sir Reader Bullard, K«C»M*G,, C.I.E., Tehran. VA Copy (E 6374/2551/65) CONEIDBUTIAL A Alec 1 BRITISH EMBASSY, WASHINGTON, D.C. 13th October, 1943 e { I* At the dinner given by Mr. Hull to Emir Peisal on October 1st, General Hurley raised with me the situation in Persia. He asked to come and see me next day to speak further on the subject. The main points in a very long and rambling story were - (a) The British and American Ministers had not got on at all well to begin with, though he thought this situation was better now. Mr. Dreyfus, while he believed he meant well, did not seem to be up to the job and probably had not made things very easy for Bullard. I am still awaiting some information necessary for the launching (on instructions) of an attack on Dreyfus. As it has not yet reached me, I thought it best to reserve ray fire. Hurley himself, after one 'blood row', had got on very well with Bullard. He thought him a fine man. The Americans accused the British (especially the UKCC) of various misdemeanours. Hurley thought these might well have occurred but he did not take them too seriously in themselves and had not reported them to the President though he had told Casey all about them. The important thing was that occasions for mutual Anglo- American criticism and irritation should be avoided. (b) Hurley had had a 'blood row' with General Connolly. (He prides himself on well-intentioned rows.) Connolly had apparently sacked an intelligence officer on his staff because he found that this officer was sharing his intelligence with the British intelligence authorities but not with the Russians, and he (Connolly) feared the Russians might be displeased. Hurley told Connolly this was a mistaken line to take since * *we and the Americans must ’get on together 'arid 'play closely in with one another in the face of the Russian attitude and the effect on us would obviously be bad. He thought Connolly v had understood and now saw the light. Connolly might seem to be Irish from his name, but he assured Hurley that his ancestors had lived in Liverpool for some 200 years; that the family had no trace of having had any Irish connections. He regarded himself as of purely English descent. He disclaimed, and Hurley believed him, any bias against the British. (c) Hurley was concerned over the security situation in Persia. Connolly shared his fears. Connolly himself was only an Army Service officer and though he had 15,000 troops under his command, these were also only Army Service men, technicians, etc., connected with communications and the flow of supplies to Russia, and in no way combatant troops. The tribes were very uppish, they threatened the lines of communication to Russia and this risked giving the Russians th opportunity of demanding to see to the safety of these communications themselves, and thus of making a further step towards the Persian Gulf to which some Russian Generals had openly told Hurley, when he was in Russia, it was their aim gain access. Harley therefore thought it most urgent tha^ should supply combatant troops in sufficient numbers to pr coramunications between the Persian Gulf and Russia. Mai'' Wilson thought the situation all right, but he himself ws not happy. /(d) The Honourable Sir Alexander Cadogan, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., Foreign Office, London, S.W.1.(d) The Persians were very upset and cordially disliked the British and the Americans, particularly the former. Several official Persians had told him that we had blamed them for failure to do various things which our ovn actions had made it impossible for them to tfo. They had begged we should allow them the authority and power to do what we demanded of them. (e) The picture Hurley described was that the Americans and we had not managed to’- ork very well together; that we had both irritated the Persians vhom the Russians had not irritated in the same way, and that therefore the Russians with aims they did not disguise were the rejoicing third party. The Persians (the Shah himself had said as much) while not preferring the Russians, and knowing what the Bear’s embrace entailed, would, unless we looked to it, inevitably surrender to that hug. He thought it most ! important for us to remedy this, after all we had important interests in the Persian Gulf. I told him I thought that the Americans also had certain interests there and this he admitted. His suggestion was that the United States and British Governments should raise the status of their Missions * in Tehran to that of Embassies (other less important countries had Embassies there).

Repeated to Tehran j , J Bagdad , ; ^ : I I I I I I had a talk to G-eneral Hurley about oil on October 20th« Clearly he had been briefed before leaving Washington. He admits that question of American oil interests outside the United States will become actively political shortly. The President’s opponents are using the argument that the war is being fought on American oil and that the President has been 'had for a sucker' by the British* The President will at the proper time use the argument that acquisition by American oil interests of immense concessions in Arabia far outweighs American oil contribution to the common Allied war effort. He affects to believe that Washington has got Middle i^ast oil on the brain and out of perspective. He was told m Washington that American interests had only 27 per cent of Middle bast oil which, he said, he told them was a misleading statement as it included only shareholding!;? s omitted] m existing producing companies and ignored undeveloped but largely proven American oil concessions which might well prove immensely valuable and possibly represent greater reserves than Britain holds. He says that the creation of the Petroleum^Resources Corporation is the American counterpart to British Government owned Anglo-Iranian. He says that he was offered the leadership of the American oil Mission to the Middle Msc but declined. He told me confidentially that a great deal of research and investigation of British and other shareholdings and oil concessions in the Middle Bast is to despatch of American oil Mission to the Middlejast an American oil expert called John Leaver is to be attached to the United States Legation Bagdad.
