On the termination of the Great War people commenced to interest themselves in the evolution of the Arabs of the Levant, and Islamic people in general. Italy has taken special interest in the future of the Near East. 188(S) ExASairaDept.The present arabic disorders and manifestations against the Jews at Hejjiaz, Yemen, Iraq, and on the Palestinian frontier, is causing Great Britain some anxiety. The unsuccessful treaty of 1927 between Ibn Saud, and the British Government, has disturbed the peace between the Arabs of the Levant, and the British. The death of Sir Gilbert Clayton in 1929 was a great loss to England. The breaking of the “Treaty of Friendship” of 1929, between England and the new King of Mecca has created a very grave issue in the East, and Ibn Saud considers it will lead to a Holy War, which, should it develop, will have a great reaction on the British Colonial Empire. The Arab insurrection will not be confined to these small states, the re percussions of the Arab dispute are being felt by all the Mussulmans of the world. The history of the Arabs in the East records, in bloody pages, the horrors of the conflict with England, and the struggle in Palestine cannot leave Italy indifferent, who, being an acknowledged great Mussulman power .will follow events closely. Italy reminds all Mussulmans of the new Roman Empire, and its pres tige as a great World and Mediterranean power. Copy. (E.-7378/145/65.) 'No. 11. (340/21/37.)

'A statement made in Tunis by Abdel Ahziz It-Tahlebbi, points out that the Mussulmans in Addis Ababa are now being treated better under the Italians than under the Negus, but as regards the conditions in Libya he could say nothing. The local editor of the Berid Barca has written to his correspondent II Kondi, in Syria, inquiring into the political situation in Palestine. The reply received was that the Arabs in general are still suffering terribly, because, the Jews have taken away their land, and that also England is against us (the arabs). Brothers of Libya and Tripolitania are asked to help by making demonstrations against the policy which is being followed in Palestine. Foreign News: —Palestine.

On the 12th October, last, the heads of the Arab community, met under the presidency of, El Amir Suleiman Karamalli, in the Mosque of the late, Munhiem Ahmet Pascha Karamalli. At this meeting there were also pre sent all the Muftis of Tripolitania, who sent a petition to the Governor General of Libya, with the request that it be forwarded to the Duce. The contents of this petition were as follows: — “We Mussulmans of Tripolitania, and the whole of Libya, are ready to join our brothers in Palestine, for better or for worst, and placing our trust in God, we hope they may obtain their full rights, and wishes. We feel that our brothers in Palestine, are suffering owing to the pro posed partitioning of the land of our forefathers. We Mussalmans of Libya submit to you, Duce, a strong protest against England, who has stood in the way of the Arabs, sucked our blood, and taken our money. Is all this not enough? No! she has also taken the Holyland, dividing it into portions amongst our enemies the Jews; consequently we are very hurt. During the Great War it was agreed that we were to be given help and freedom, but now it is the contrary, so much so, that now England has turn ed against us. Beloved Duce, we want your help, such as you have promised us in your speeches many times. Now you know our opposition to ignorant England, we leave everything in your hands, so that Italy may give us a helping hand and we are always ready to take your orders as before. England versus the rights of the Mussulmans. The British Government returned to Palestine, and sent out all the Mussalmans! England wishes to act against the word of God! If the Mussalmans leave Palestine, the British Government should hand over England, because centuries ago it was part of the Roman Empire, and also8 Spain to the Mussalmans. It was the Arabs and not the Jews who helped England to take Neapolis. Who was it who destroyed the Railway lines during the Great War? it was not the Jews, but the Arabs! We sent away the Turks from Palestine, with the intention that we should be allowed to stay there. We have helped England also in the taking of Aleppo, and we Mussulmans are upset because England has given the best part of the country to the Jews, leaving the other to the Arabs.

As the period of one year mentioned in article 9 of the Saudi “In structions concerning Traffic in Slaves” (sent to you in my despatch No. 278 of the 6th October, 1936), expired on the 2nd October last, this Legation has since that date been endeavouring, by discreet enquiries, to ascertain what the exact position is. I have the honour to report the following information^ which is intended to complete that contained in my despatch No. 102 of the 24th May last. I must emphasise, however, that the indirect enquiries which I have caused to be made have been quite unofficial, so that the resulting information, though I believe it to be correct, must be regard ed with reserve. 2. Nothing has been heard of any six-monthly report on the lines of article 14, nor of any supplementary observations of the Inspector of Slave Affairs (who, it wil be remembered, is the Director-General of Police at Mecca). It is not laid down, however, that such reports should be pub lished. r 3. Certain licences have been issued to slave-brokers in accordance with article 12. Two brokers, named Hassan Amudi and Muhammad-bin-Seif, say that they obtained licences from the Jedda police authorities against the payment of £1 gold'per licence. 4. One or two slaves only have been registered at Jedda. But the Jedda brokers say that a large number of slaves have been registered at Mecca.9 -p • ^f r '-^ us J n ^ aI1, P ro_consu l at this Legation, who was employed at i} a during this summer, reports that there were a large number of slaves at the capital.

Important* Your telegram No. Il9 of December 31st. , /saw Ibn Saud in camp near Ashaira at 8-30 a.m. on January 4th and handed him an aide-memoire in the sense of your telegram No. 117 2. After examination of text in private and long discussion Ibn Saud saui he was inclined to optimism. But this is obviously based on his belief that m the long run His Majesty’s Government cannot decide partition to be either just or practicable Moreover the optimism is tempered by his fear that atmosphere in Palestine is unfavourable to the work of proposed com mission The publication of despatch would help but would not L enough Many Palestinians were m exile or in prison and outrages were reported dady Suggestion by Fuad that a general amnesty might be granted mime dlately he ruled out as not practical politics. Perhaps the severity of the sentences of military courts might be diminished for a beginning and some thing in the nature of an amnesty might be worked up to if guarantees and co-operation were assured. I believe he is already considering what he can do to help to create a better atmosphere. 8 e can ao r rr ^ a ?? m Spoke witil the g reatest solemnity of peril of position of His Majesty s Government and consequently of his own. The P fire in Palestine was small but the wind of intrigue was blowing the flame straight at the living tree. Not only was he anxious on political grounds but the Palestine business was infinitely distressing to him personally. For four months he had been unable to listen to broadcasts from Jerusalem because they were so pamful to him. He had decided to listen on Januarv 3rd to the first Arabic broadcast from London and filled his tent with Arabs for the occasion When the news was announced that an Arab had been execut ed Pa [ esfc ^ e be f /. t as though the rope was round his own neck and h- and the Arabs with him could not refrain from tears. At this His Maiestv was deeply moved and tears in the sincerity of which I at least belief came 7 admitted that the British did not PMish Arabs for10 their political opinions but asked whether the crimes for which they were hanging and imprisoning Arabs would have been committed if it had not been for the policy of His Majesty’s Government. I know a reply of a kind to this question but none that will convince Ibn Saud or any other Arab. w 4. Despatch by bag today. Addressed to Foreign Office telegram No. 5 of January 5th; repeated to Cairo telegram No. 1, Baghdad telegram No. 1, Jerusalem telegram No. 1. ( 8 ) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 18th January 1938. [E.-7587/351/65.] Letter from Sir R. Bullard, to Mr. Eden.—(Received December 29), (No. 177), DATED THE 29TH DECEMBER 1937. Jedda, December 7, 1937.. It appears that certain Arabic newspapers in Egypt published a tale, which has been reproduced in the Syrian and Iraqi press, alleging that Ibn Saud, out of deference to the feelings of Great Britain, had refused to allow a general Arab congress to be held in Mecca, and that if he persisted in this refusal a congress would probably be held in some other Arab country. I have the honour to inform you that the Umm-al-Qura of the 3rd December denies this report in an article, which is to the following effect: — 2. This report is entirely without foundation. No application for such a congress was ever made by any person or body of persons. It would not be unreasonable to say that such an application was made and rejected (though, in fact, nothing of the kind happened), but it is fantastic to sug gest that the application could be rejected out of deference to the wishes of the British. The rumour must have been intended to discourage and divide the Arabs at the very moment when they feel the need for concord and unity. Its author must know that the Government of His Majesty is not a negligible force and that the person of His Majesty is the centre of the circle of Arab countries and the symbol of Arab aims, and that conse quently the dissemination of false news about Flis Majesty must profit the enemies of the Arabs and of Islam. Every keen Arab and Moslem should know the truth, that the King is not moved by caprice or covetousness ; he is the man of the Arabs, conscious of his racial and religious duty and devoting himself and his possessions to the promotion of the truth and the faith. He does not like self-advertisement or propaganda. He never embarks upon any matter affecting the interests of Arabs or Moslem interests unless he is sure that he will not have to draw back unsuccessful. He has experience of the world and knows the harm of futile demonstrations. The Govern ment and the people of Saudi Arabia naturally attach the greatest import ance to the Palestine question, not from any personal ambition but because it is an Arab and a Moslem question. It is fitting that an Arab Shara’ Moslem Government and a country where the divine inspiration was reveal ed and Islam originated should take anxious thought for all matters affect ing the Arabs and the Moslems in all the territories which they inhabit. On the other hand it is fitting that the country which contains the two Holy Sanctuaries and is based on piety and divine worship alone should be left to itself in such matters and safeguarded from suspicion, so that the will of God alone may be done. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Excellency the High Com missioner for Palestine (No. 1728/384/476) and His Majesty’s representa tives at Cairo and Bagdad (Nos. 1729/384/476 and 1730/384/476) respectively.11 ( 9 ) {Received on 6th February 1938, with Political Secretary's letter No. 3, dated the 20th January 1938.)

Translation of memorandum on Palestine by Ibn Saud will be sent by. next bag. It has an annex showing why he considers partition neither just nor practicable. 2. Memorandum contains much that His Majesty’s Government have heard before about Anglo-Arab interests, peril of foreign intrigues, suspi cion of Arabs about Jewish ambitions and so on. Ibn Saud is, he says, much distressed about what he calls policy of severity and was about to send His Majesty’s Government a communication on that subject when despatch of December 23rd brought a ray of hope. He is prepared to do his best to induce Palestinians to put their case before new commission but feels unable to do this until His Majesty’s Government have done something to improve the atmosphere, since he advised the people of Palestine once and they were disappointed, and moreover their fears have been justified by hopes and12 ambitions published by Jews.^ He does not presume to advise His Maiesty’s Government but suggests their consideration as preliminary steps :— (i) Stoppage of Jewish immigration until final solution is adopted or at least for two years. ' (ii) Prohibition of sale of land for same period. (in) Preliminary steps towards restoration of normal conditions by diminishing severity of military courts, permitting return of exiles amd deportees, pardoning persons imprisoned politically or administratively, and inviting all to co-operate with the new commission. 3. I send this without comment since His Majesty’s Government have all information required for estimate of its value. Similarly they know what I do not know, viz\ whether we need help or can struggle out of Palestine marsh unaided. 58 ^ ( 12 ) (Received on the 26th February 1938, with Political Secretary's letter fto. 6, dated the 10th February 1938.)

Bullard, to Mr. Eden.—(Received January 11, 1938), (No. 181), dated Jedda, December, 18, 1937. I have had the honour to report to you by telegram on various ques tions raised in an interview which I had with Ibn Saud on the 15th Decem ber, during a visit of forty-eight hours which he paid to Jedda. I now give a summary of the whole of the conversation. 2. His Majesty began, quite unexpectedly, with Iraq. He was wor ried at the instability and wffiat might be called lack of continuity there. The Cabinet was divided and resignations were threatened, and some of the tribes were still hostile. I talked of the difficulties which naturally beset a country in the first stages of self-government, and said that in any case I should be surprised to hear that Saudi Arabia had any ground of complaint against the Iraq Government. Ibn Saud said that that was true. Even in the time of Hikmet Sulaiman (though he seemed relieved that that regime had come to an end) he could not say that the attitude of the Iraq Govern ment had been anything but correct towards himeslf and Saudi Arabia, but he felt that he never knew what would happen there next. For instance, there were people there who were bringing forward schemes for Palestine, not from love of Palestine or of the Arabs, nor from friendship towards His Majesty’s Government, but from personal ambition. I concluded that he was referring to the project of Nuri Pasha’s, which is mentioned in Bagdad telegram No. 261 of the 13th Decemebr, and which formed the subject of Mr. Kelly’s despatch, of which a copy was sent to me under cover of your despatch No. 369, dated the 30th September, 1937, and this impression was confirmed when the King mentioned a scheme which Nuri Pasha had explained to Sheikh Hafiz Wahba in Egypt some time ago; but, as will be seen later, Ibn Saud had also heard of another Palestine scheme affecting Iraq. I sent a telegram to the Foreign Office on this point, No. 97, dated the 16th December. 3. The King then spoke of the Italians, of whom he seemned to be no less suspicious than he was when he talked to Mr. Rendel and myself in March. They were always interfering, now in one country, now in another. Look at the Yemen! After the publication of the Italo-Yemeni Treaty not long ago, he wrote to the Imam and asked whether there was anything behind what was published. The Imam assured him that there was nothing, and he believed the Imam, who was a clever, wide-awake man; but he would not answer for the Imam’s sons, nor for the Yemeni officials. 4. The next subject was arms. Ibn Saud said that, as His Majesty’s Government knew, he had tried to treat the Italian offer of arms in such a way as not to place himself under an obligation by acceptance and yet not to offend the Italians. The offer of Italian rifles he had eventually refused, 1^8,S / ExAffairsDept14 on the ground that his forces were equipped with Mausers, and that to in troduce some weapons of a new type would complicate the rearmament ques tion. The Italians then said that they would get him any kind of rifles he liked, e.g., Mausers from Austria or Germany. The King then pleaded poverty, but the Italians said that that need not worry him, they would arrange easy terms. Keeping to his delaying tactics, the King said that if they would provide samples he would study the matter; and there the matter rested for the moment. Had he done right? What would His Majesty’s Government say? I repeated more or less what Sheikh Hafiz Wahba had already heard at the Foreign Office. His Majesty’s Government had pro vided all the arms which their own urgent needs enabled them to spare. If it had been within their power they would gladly have supplied more, but it was not. Ibn Saud was the sole judge of his own requirements in the matter of arms. It would evidently be better if he could have recourse to neutral supplies rather than to a Government like the Italian, which presumably, as His Majesty had himself said, was not offering cheap arms out of pure love for Saudi Arabia, but if in the end he could not escape the Italian offer, he would at least be acting with his eyes open. Ibn Saud said that he would continue to delay as far as he could, but there usually came a time in such cases where a decision could no longer be postponed. However, he would see what he could do. 5. I mention here that, according to a statement which Fuad Hamza had made to me the day before, the Italians wanted to sell Italian guns and anti-aircraft guns, in fact, any war material Ibn Saud might want as well as Mauser rifles. 6. Passing then to aviation, Ibn Saud said that he much wanted to get rid of the Italians. He realised that to replace them by British or French might create an awkward situation, but replacement by Moslems would not be open to the same objection. Could His Majesty’s Government suggest some suitable man from Egypt or Iraq for this purpose ? I asked whether what His Majesty wanted was a trained air-force man to take charge of Saudi aviation, and after some talk His Majesty explained that he would like a sort of chief of staff to advise on all arms, and that, failing that, he would be glad to have an expert to take charge of aviation. I promised to report this desire to His Majesty’s Government at once, and I have done so in my telegram No. 99, dated the 16th December. From the tenor of the conversation, I assume that Ibn Saud would apply to the Government con cerned for the loan of a suitable expert if he could first have the advice of His Majesty’s Government as to the character and capacity of some possible candidates. I could see objections to the proposal, and felt sceptical as to the advantage, other than the elimination of the Italians, which Ibn Saud might expect to obtain if it were carried out; but we have had to blow cold upon so many Saudi aviation schemes that I did not want to be discouraging about this one at the outset, the more so as there is nothing to prevent the King’s applying to Egypt or Iraq without consulting us, in which case some quite unsuitable person might be sent here. 7. No reference was made by Ibn Saud to the alleged offer of a Soviet air mission (your despatch No. 413, dated the 1st November). This did not surprise me, for when I had mentioned the subject to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin the day before, he had expressed ignorance and surprise, and after making enquiry had told me that no such offer had been made and that Sheikh Hafiz must have misunderstood something much vaguer as to which he would get the papers from Mecca. I have no more information on this point at pre sent, but it seems clear that there is no question of the acceptance of a Soviet air mission by Ibn Saud. 8. The King thqn talked at length about Palestine. The views he expressed were summarised in my telegram No. 98, dated the 16th Decem ber. He was not violent, or even reproachful, but very anxious about his own position as being dependent on that of His Majesty’s Government. He said more than once, as he has said before, that while he objected to the»o 15 partition scheme as an Arab and a Moslem, he objected to it also because he felt it would be ruinous to His Majesty’s Government and therefore dangerous to himself. At one point he said he would rather that the British mandate should last for another century. I employed the familiar argu ments in favour of partition, especially the one which has always appealed A to me personally (provided that frontier less unfavourable to Arabs than those suggested in the report of the Royal Commission could be found), that a limitation by territory would be more stable and more likely to be final than a limitation by population, but the King said that, on the contrary, he believed that the creation of a separate Jewish State would be a perpetual irritant and source of danger. But, indeed, he seemed unable to believe that partition would ever be effected. 9. The King asked whether I had seen the reply which he had caused to be given to the accusation that out of deference to the feelings of His Majesty’s Government he had refused to allow an Arab conference to be held in Mecca. I said that I had seen it in the Umm-al-Qura (see my des patch No. 177, dated the 7th December), and that it seemed, if I might say so, to have been drafted with His Majesty’s usual wisdom. Ibn Saud said that in spite of the denial there was something in the report. It had been suggested that there should be a secret conference about Palestine in Mecca, but he had refused to allow it, alleging that Mecca was a place for religious worship, not for political conferences. That was, in fact, one of his reasons, but. of course, he had others; he never embarked upon any policy until he was sure it was reasonable, and he did not wish to embarrass His Majesty’s Government. And besides, if the holding of a conference had been the course to pursue, he would have proposed it himself and not fol lowed the suggestions of others. 10. Here the King revealed again a secondary anxiety, viz., that His Majesty’s Government would come to some arrangement about Palestine with someone else in the Arab world, or come to some fresh decision without his knowledge, and thus damage his prestige irretrievably. There was, ho said, a story going about to which many were giving credence, that His Majesty’s Government proposed to declare a cessation of Jewish immigra tion into Palestine and to hand the country over to the Iraq Government, who would then, as part of the bargain, open Palestine to unrestricted im migration by Jews. He said that he had always been frank with His Majesty’s Government, and he hoped they would always be frank with him. I described the scheme he had mentioned as fantastic in itself and incredible for two other reasons. In the first place partition was still the declared policy of His Majesty’s Government, though, of course, no one could foresee what the recommendations of the forthcoming commission would be, and in the second, His Majesty’s Government appreciated the complete frankness and sincerity with which His Majesty had always acted in the matter of Palestine, and I was sure they w r ould never take any serious deci sion on the subject without giving him the earliest possible notice. 11. Ibn Saud said he wished that some policy could be found which w r ould not place His Majesty’s Government in opposition to the Arabs. The one question of Palestine apart, the interests of His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Arabs were identical, but the Arabs found themselves facing the Jews, whom they could easily deal with as Jews alone, and behind the Jews they found the British, and conflict was inevitable. The Arabs knew well and execrated the treatment of the Arabs in Libya by the Italians both before and after the war, and no one could have believed a year ago to what extent Mussolini would induce the Arabs to look upon him as their cham pion. His success was entirely due to the British policy in Palestine. 12. At the time of the interview I had not received the instructions con veyed in your telegram No. 110, dated the 15th December, which arrived after Ibn Saud had left Jedda, but, as will be seen from what I have said, I anticipated your assurance that there was nothing fresh to say, and that, if there was, he wx&gt;uld be told as soon as possible. I also anticipated yourmessage about the necessity for mutual comprehension of each other’s diffi culties by the two Governments. I asked His Majesty whether he had not found, as he rose from being ruler of Kiyadh to his present high position, that at every stage the points of contact with the world increased and poli tical questions became more complicated, and when the King said that this was so, I asked whether he could not believe that the affairs of Great Britain, coming as she did into touch with many countries which did not concern Saudi Arabia seriously and having possessions all over the world, were even more complicated than His Majesty’s. Ibn Saud pondered a moment as though the matter had not struck him in that light before and said that he agreed, and I hope that the argument helped to convince him ot the truth of my assurance, that it was not from failure to give careful attention to his proposals that His Majesty’s Government had not been able to decide upon a policy more satisfactory from his point of view. 13. The matters other than politics which were touched upon at the interview are dealt with in my despatch No. 182, dated the 18th December. Throughout the interview Ibn Saud showed the friendliness and desire to co-operate with His Majesty’s Government which were shown during the talks in March last when Mr. Rendel was here. 14. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine and 4 ransjordan, His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, His Excellency the Governor of Aden and the Hon. the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. (15) Memo, from His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, No. 218/271/'3, dated the 30th January 1938. Presents his compliments to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, New Delhi, and has the honour to transmit to him the undermentioned documents. Description of Enclosure. To Foreign Office, despatch No. 17 of 30th January 1938 and enclo sure. Law relating to converts to Islam. Letter from H M.’s Minister, Jedda, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 17 (217/271/3), dated the 30th January 1938. I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a law which appeared in the “Umm-al-Qura” of January 21st, 1938, prescribing the formalities to be fulfilled by any recent convert to Islam who wishes to^visit either Mecca or Medina. There is to be set up a religious committee in Jedda with authority to examine such persons and any documents which they may produce in support of their claims, and to issue a decree, where the conversion is adjudged to be genuine, which will authorise the convert to proceed to the Holy Cities. 2. As you are aware, there have been several cases during the last few years where persons claiming to have been converted to Islam have been detained in Jedda for considerable periods while their claims were being examined, and at least one case, that of Mrs. Sterling, an American ladv (Jedda Report for February 1936 paragraph 76) permission to proceed L&gt; Mecca was eventually refused. Article 4 of the law reserves to the Saudi Arabian Government “the absolute right to refuse permission to enter the two sanctuaries to any person suspected of political, military or other [ulterior] aims’’, and even were this provision wanting, no religious com mittee would issue a decree involving authorisation to enter Mecca without17 instructions from the King. Suspicion is chiefly directed against those persons who profess Islam in order to be able to visit a forbidden city, either out of love of novelty or from a desire to secure notoriety, and this 0 ^ suspicion will now have been strengthened by the appearance of a book enti tled “Triumphant Pilgrimage'’ and the discussion which it has aroused. This book, which is written by Owen Rutter, purports to give an account of the visit to Mecca of a British subject born in the United Kingdom who appears under the name of “Chale’’. The real name of this man is McRryan, and his appearance in Jedda and his admission to Mecca at the last moment were chronicled in the Jedda Reports in 193G (January para graph 36, February paragraph 76). From reviews which have appeared and from information obtained from Sarawak, where Mr. McBryan was formerly employed and whence he set but on his pilgrimage, it is evident that much of the story as related by him through Owen Rutter is untrue and that his religious professions, albeit supported by circumcision with a flint, are open to suspicion. 3. It is unlikely that the new law will make any practical change in regard to recent converts. They will still be regarded with suspicion and will have to satisfy the King before being allowed to enter either Mecca or Medina. But the fact that they will not be allowed to perform the pilgrimage as a matter of course is now laid down by law, so that recent converts may be aware before they set out upon the journey to the Hejaz of the conditions which they will have to fulfil. 4. Copies of this despatch are being sent to India and Singapore. Enclosure to Jedda, despatch No. 17 (217/271/3) of 30th January 1939, Extract from the Mecca “Umm-ul-Qura”, No. 685 of January 21st, J938. A Law Concerning Converts to Islam, and Their Entry into the two Sanctuaries. An ordinance has been promulgated ratifying this law, and ordering its enforcement. Article I. —Any recent convert to Islam shall, on his arrival at Jedda for the performance of ’Umra or the visit to Medina, present to the reli gious committee in Jedda documents supporting his claim. Article II. —Any recent convert to Islam who wishes to enter either of the two sanctuaries shall submit to the religious committee appointed by the Government at Jedda certificates legalised by the authorities before whom he adopted the Moslem faith. A rticle III. —Any recent convert to Islam, who possesses certificates legalised by a high Moslem committee which is recognised in other Moslem countries, or attested by any of the great Moslem Ul&amp;ma (learned men) known to the Government, shall be entitled to enter the two sanctuaries after the legalisation of his certificates by the religious committee in Jeddia. Article IV. —The application of any recent convert to Islam, who does not possess the certificates mentioned in: the preceding article, shall be dealt with by the religious committee, and he shall remain in Jedda for a period of fifteen days on probation;, and if his claim is found to be true and his (belief in) Islam established he shall be permitted to enter the two sanc tuaries after obtaining a decree from the Sharia Court at Jedda, in accord ance with the provisions of the preceding article, to the effect that he has adopted the Islamic faith.. Article V. —The religious committee at Jedda which shall have the right to examine the certificates of converts to Islam and to examine any convert to Islam who is not in possession of a certificate shall be composed of the following persons :— l. The President of the Sharia Court at Jedda. 188(S) ExAffairsDept.18 2. The President of the Committee of Virtue. 3. One of those Ulama whom the Government may think fit for this purpose. 4. The Government of His Majesty the King shall have the absolute right to refuse permission to enter the two sanctuaries to any person suspect ed of political, military or other [ulterior] aims. ( 16 ) Memo, from the India Office, London, No. P. Z.-1155/1938, dated the 20th February 1938. Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Depart ment, India Office. A copy has been sent to the Foreign Secretary, Government of India. [E.-662/662/25.]! Letter from Sir R. Bullard, to Mr. Eden.—(Received February 4), (No. 5), DATED JEDDA, JANUARY 17, 1938. I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a regulation published by the Saudi Government regarding compensation to workmen in “technical industrial concerns.” The regulation is dated the 9th Sep tember, 1937, but it was not published until the 3rd December, though it was communicated to the firms concerned a few days before that date. 2. It is understood that the regulation has been drafted by Najib Salha (Personalities, No. 112) and that he has drawn his material from the com pensation laws of several other countries. The badness of the drafting, which is remarkable even for Saudi laws, is probably the compiler’s own. To mention only one instance: An employee who was paid 39^ Saudi rivals a month would escape the definitions in sections 4 and 5, and thus his employer would not be liable in respect of any accident that happened to him in the course of his work. Some of the other points where the drafting is defective are indicated in square brackets. 3. Judged by the standards of this country, the rates of compensation are extraordinarily high, e.g., £450 gold for permanent total disablement of a skilled workman. It is quite right that wealthy foreign companies should pay adequate compensation in such cases, and I am far from sug gesting that the rates, regarded absolutely, are too high; but they are enor mously greater than anything the Saudi Government would pay. More over, it is not certain that the victim or his next-of-kin would receive the full amount paid by the company. This doubt is founded upon the know ledge that the companies to whom this regulation applies are required by the terms of concessions to pay in gold for certain personnel who do not, in fact, receive salary at those rates. For instance, the Petroleum Develop ment (Western Arabia) (Limited) have to pay to the Saudi Government £500 gold per annum in respect of the supervision of their concession by Najib Salha, and £20 gold per mensem for an “inspector” of very low status who is supposed to watch the drilling on the Farsan Islands. It is to be hoped that the analogy I have drawn is not sound and that the full compensation will go to the victim or his next-of-kin, but a little scepticism is permissible. 4. The provision most open to objection is contained in article 20, which makes the regulation retrospective. It was partly on this account, though also on account of the high rates of compensation, that the Jedda manager of the Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) proposed to his19 principals that the regulation should be resisted; they, however, instructed him to take no action. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company, it is believed, have asked their principals for instructions. It is inevitable that in the end all companies concerned will accept the regulation without protest. It is inevitable that this poverty-striken country should try to make money out of the few foreign concessions in various ways, and it will not pay any of the companies to enter into controversy unless larger sums are at stake than are involved in the application of this regulation. 5 I am sending a copy of this despatch and enclosure to the Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the Department of Overseas Trade (No. 0. T. 3, 102/215/2). (17) Memorandum from the India Office, London, No. P. Z.-1458/1938, DATED THE 5TH MARCH 1938. Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Depart ment, India Office. A copy has been sent to the Foreign Secretary, Government of India. Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 2nd March 1938. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, No. 9, (134/399/7), dated the 19th January 1938. In my telegram No. 23, dated January 17th I had the honour to report a conversation which I had with Ibn Saud after a dinner which he gave on January 15th on the occasion of the visit of Lord Belhaven. As personal relations have considerable weight with Ibn Saud, as with Arabs in general, I think it may be useful to give you an account of this meeting between the King and Lord Belhaven, who is an old acquaintance of his. 2. In the early part of the Great War Lord Belhaven was employed as a Political Officer in Iraq and as Political Agent at Kuwait, and later he was sent on a mission to Ibn Saud. His mission did not last long, as he was superseded by Mr. Philby, but he conceived a great liking and admiration for Ibn Saud, and when the Amirs Saud and Muhammad came to Great Britain for the Coronation he enter tained them for some days. The Amir Saud suggested that Lord Belhaven should visit Saudi Arabia, and being in Aden on his way back from India Lord Belhaven telegraphed to say that if His Majesty would care to see him he could be in Jedda about January 13th. The King seemed very glad to have the message, and said that he would come down to Shumaisu some ten miles below Mecca on the Mecca-Jedda road, for a meeting. He pro posed to accommodate Lord Belhaven in a palace near Jedda, but did not insist when I asked to have the pleasure of entertaining Lord Belhaven, who was a colleague of mine in Iraq. Lord Belhaven spent a week with me in Jedda, and on the appointed day we went to Shumaisi to meet His Majesty. 3. On arrival at Shumaisi we were shown to the King’s tent. Lord Belhaven is sixty-six years of age and walks slowly and with difficulty, and20 it added to Ibn Saud’s obvious pleasure at the meeting that a man older than himself and far less active should pay a visit to Jedda in order to see him for an hour—had acted, in fact, as an Arab would do when passing near a friend’s tent. He sat for about half an hour in informal talk. The conversation is not worth recording in detail but it may be mentioned that the King was highly amused when Lord Belhaven, referring to the improve ments in public security and in other respects, said that the King would perhaps one day restore the great dam at Ma’reb—forgetting that MaTeb is in the Yemen. When Lord Belhaven said that the English were like the Arabs in being lovers of freedom Ibn Saud hastened to explain that the ruler did what he thought right but was under the orders of Allah like anv other Arab. I suggested that the ruler governed according to a religious constitution, and Ibn Saud accepted the phrase as accurate. In the course of this talk the King invited me to stay with him in camp next winter, it there should be normal rain to make the desert worth visiting. 4. After the King had performed the sunset prayers we reassembled for dinner, which was set out on a long table in another tent. The Amir Faisal was banished to the other end of the table with Shaikh Yusuf Yasin and two or three other officials. At the end where the King sat were only Lord al-Kurdi, who admits that his anti-British policy is not that of his master. As a concession to us there w T ere European dishes, but in accordance with the King’s custom all the dishes were on the table at once. One of the important items in the King’s diet was milk, which an armed slave at his elbow held constantly ready in a hideous green and white enamel mug much chipped with long service. 5. Most of the time during dinner the talk was about old times, and especially the time when Lord Belhaven visited Riyadh in 1917. Most of the men Lord Belhaven asked about are dead; ‘Tut” said the King, waving towards a massed crowd of retainers, “their sons are probably there’’. He then spoke of the heavy casualties in some of his battles with Ibn Rashid, and said that he embarked upon one battle with one hundred and fifty men and came off with one camel—his own, and various wounds, one of which left a finger distorted and useless. He said that of the men who helped him to take Riyadh—his first success—only three remained, and he repeated their names and the names of their fathers. G. The dinner did not take very long, and after dinner we sat only for a few minutes, drinking coffee and talking. The King wanted to talk to me (about Palestine) and to hurry to Mecca; Lord Belhaven therefore said goodbye and withdrew. The King said goodbye to him very kindly, and spoke of him after he had gone with great appreciation and affection, as a man “with a sincere heart’’. I am sure that he was touched by the visit and the unaffected friendliness of Lord Belhaven’s manner and conversa tion and I believe that the visit was in the narrow sense “useful” to His Majesty’s Government. 7. I could not help contrasting this meeting with the various functions at which I had seen Ibn Saud when Mr. Philby was present. The King talks in a familiar fashion to Mr. Philby and makes genial fun of him, but there is nothing in his manner towards Mr. Philby of that real friend liness and respect which he showed to Lord Belhaven. The fact is, I think, that Ibn Saud is telling the truth when he says that he likes the English (he would I fear include even a Representative Peer for Scotland in this definition), and that the more English they are the better he likes them. It is no recommendation to him to have become a Moslem, to imitate the Arabs by saying “God prolong your life!” before every remark addressed to the King, or to be wearing sandals when all the other “courtiers” present are in socks and slippers and the King himself is wearing socks with “Pure wool Made in England” on the soles.(Received on the 12th March 1938, with Political Secretary'a letter 1 No. 8, dated the 2Mh February 1938.) P. Z -1109/38. Enclosure in Foreign Office covering note, dated IGth February, 1938, No. E.-767/196/25. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, No. 8 (124/551/6), dated the 17th January 1938. I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of a circular which I have received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asking the foreign missions not to communicate with any Saudi department except the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This is presumably the circular about which I tele graphed to you in my telegram No. 12, dated January 10th. It does not however indicate that the object of the circular is the elimination of foreign propaganda by foreign missions-, and I therefore despatched my telegram No 19, dated January 13th. Fuad Bey talked at some length about this circular in a conversation which I had with him a few days ago, and I understood from what he said that the Saudi Government would refer openly to the distribution of political literature as inconsonant with the character of the Holy Land of Islam, but I was perhaps mistaken. The form of the circular is highly discreet, but I do not see why, when taken with the measures to which Fuad Bey referred in talking to me, it should not have considerable success in limiting Italian propaganda. As I men tioned in my report on the interview with Ibn Saud on January 4th (my des patch No. 1 of January 5th) the King said that he suppressed propaganda newspapers, etc., whenever they were discovered, and Fuad Bey informed me that the authorities had detected and put a stop to the practice by which the employees of the Italian Legation gave propaganda newspapers to the Saudi postmen to distribute on their rounds. It appears that the King was particularly incensed by the impudent piece of propaganda to which refer ence is made in Mr. Trott’s despatch No. 159 of October 11th, 1937, where a man formerly employed in a minor post in the Jedda Customs, who was alleged to have spoken in Eritrea in favour of the Fascist regime, was re presented by the Italians as being Director-General of Customs in Saudi Arabia; 2. However discreet the wording of the circular I am confident that a serious attempt will be made to prevent the Italian Legation from spread ing propaganda in this country. Measures are to be taken, Fuad Bey assures me, to prevent the use of the posts and the telephone for propaganda tJurposes, and orders are to be given to Saudi officials not to iffix with mem bers of foreign missions except on official occasions. Thus the interpreter of the Italian Legation, Muhammad Ali Darfer, who it is believed' is'to be posted to Mecca, will be discouraged from visiting any officials except those of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or to hand propaganda to them, though it still remains to be seen whether the authorities will find means to pre vent the distribution of propaganda newspapers in the street, or to restrain Monsieur Darfer from visiting private persons in Mecca in order to spread propaganda for his Government. 3. It is to be hoped that the provisions of the circular will be applied exclusively to what'Fuad Bey declares to be their real object and will not be used to hamper our pilgrimage work. It will be remembered that this Legation had noticed a tendency on the part of the Saudi authorities to compel the Indian Vice-Consul to apply for assistance to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs instead of the local authorities concerned—a procedure which would have greatly reduced his usefulness. The recently appointed Indian Vice-Consul has not noticed any such tendency, and indeed he receiv ed a warm welcome and promises of help from the Minister 1 of ‘ Finance, 188{S) ExAGairsDept.22 . who is in charge of the pilgrimage. I am therefore hopeful that any diffi culties which the Legation experienced in this respect during the last season or two were personal to the late Vice-Consul and vanished with his depar ture, and at present I do not fear that under cover of the present regulation the difficulties will begin again. 4 I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosure to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo (No. 125/551/6), and Bagdad (No. 127/551/6), and to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine and Trans-Jordan (No. 126/551/6). Enclosure to Jedda despatch No. 8 (124/551/6) of January 17th, 1938. No. 101/18/4. Translation. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mecca, 9th DhuT Qaa’da 1356. 10th January, 1938. Circular. I have the honour to explain to Their Excellencies the Ministers Pleni potentiaries and the Charges d’Affaires, that the Government of His Majesty the King, being desirous of facilitating the work of the Legations at Jedda had previously adopted a number of measures in order to enable them to maintain touch with this Ministry, and to carry out the formalities which the said Legations may require from it. It has been observed that on some occasions, official formalities are carried out between certain Legations and other offices instead of with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs direct, and since the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the official channel of communi cation between the Legations and the Government of His Majesty the King, I beg that this rule may be observed, and any action contrary to it avoided. In order to increase facilities of communications between the Legations and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Government of His Majesty think it fitting that Shaikh Ibrahim ibn Muammar, the Qaimmaqam of Jedda, shall be entrusted, in addition to his original duties, with the function of receiving the urgent statements or messages which the Legations may desire to communicate speedily to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and also that Shaikh Ali Taha, the assistant of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shall remain attached to him in connection with the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This new arrangement will complete the arrangements previously made for the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or of his Deputy, in Jedda, and for meeting the [foreign] representatives there, and I trust that the result of the same will assist all of us in strengthening the relations and the bonds of friendship which happily exist between us.

Cypher telegram from Sir ^ Important. R. Bullard (Jedda), No. 19, dated the 13th January 1938. My telegram No. 12. Circular received from Ministry of Foreign Affairs asks foreign missions to communicate only with the Ministry adding that it has been observed that on some occasions formalities take place between certain Lega tions and other offices. This is presumably the one to which Fuad referred. I understood him to say that the reasons for the circular would appear in it but I may have been mistaken. [Gp. undec.] discreet approach seems preferable, and in any case I have no doubt Saudi authorities are serious in their intention to restrict Italian propaganda. Amongst measures men tioned by Fuad were prevention of use of posts and telephones for propa ganda and orders to Saudi officials not to mix with members of foreign missions except on official occasions.

[E.-1099/10/31.] Letter from Sir R. Bullard, to Mr. Eden.—(Received February 28), (No. 21, Confidential), dated Jedda, February 2, 1938. As you are aware, it is extremely difficult to find out what people are thinking in this country. Contact with the local inhabitants, which has always been rare, has ceased altogether since the promulgation of the orders designed to circumscribe Italian propaganda on which I reported in my despatch No. 8, dated the 17th January, 1938, and in any case discipline is too strictly maintained by the King for Saudi subjects to speak freely to members of foreign Legations on lines which he might not approve. For these reasons I think it worth while to transmit to you the attached extract from a conversation which I had recently with M. Naidyonoff, the “White’’ Russian pilot employed by the Saudi Government. 2. The conversation arose out of a projected flight of three Saudi planes to Wejh, which has been the subject of discussion for several weeks. One is to be piloted by the Italian, Major Ciccu, a second by M. Naidyonoff, and the third by a Saudi, and the rest of the Saudi pilots are to be carried as passengers. The party would stay some ten days in Wejh, I gather, before returning. The start has been postponed several times for lack ot one thing or another, and it has now been put off again because Major Ciccu is ill. When speaking to me about this flight on the 1st February, M. Naidyonoff said that he was thinking of giving up his post here because he did not want to be involved in hostilities. A few days before he had spoken of this possibility and had said that, whatever happened, he him self, as an officer who served in the Denikin army, would never take part in hostilities against the British. On both occasions I deprecated any talk about hostilities involving Saudi Arabia and, indeed, all talk about the imminence of war, but last night M. Naidyonoff seemed greatly disturbed. As will be seen from the enclosed note, his feelings are based on nothing more solid than the attitude of the commandant of the Jedda forces, Said- al-Kurdi, who admits that his anti-British policy is not that of is master, Ibn Saud. But it is interesting to hear of the influence which the views of an unpopular man have here, because, they are anti-British and pan- Arab, and thus coincide with those of the younger Saudis, and to learn24 of the belief that, if a serious revolt broke out in Transjordan, it would attract the spontaneous participation of the Saudi tribes on the border, and when once the movement had begun Ibn Baud would have to allow it to con tinue or perhaps even to take part in it. 3. There is no doubt that at present Ibn Baud does not want anything of the sort to happen. If he had not been really attached to the view which he has professed on several occasions during the last eighteen months, viz., that his interests and those of His Majesty’s Government are identical, he Would hardly have acted as he has done in regard to Palestine. The import ant question is how far he will continue to adhere to that view if there is no radical change in the Palestine policy of His Majesty’s Government. 1 have recently recorded my opinion that he continues to support His Majesty’s Government as far as he can because he cannot believe that in the long run they will carry out a policy grossly unjust (from his point of view) to the Arabs, and that his strong' professions of friendship must not be regarded as a blank cheque. He has recently pointed out that his help in bringing about a restoration of order in Palestine so that the Royal Com mission could carry out its work, and later in inducing the Palestine Arabs to give evidence, resulted in disappointment for the Arabs, and has said that while he is ready to assist in bringing about an atmosphere in which the technical commission can begin its labours he cannot this time take the initiative. In fact, he assisted His Majesty’s Government and the Arabs got nothing out of it (again from their point of view, and his), and whereas last time he gave his assistance because of his general belief in the “justice” of His Majesty’s Government, he cannot afford to do that again. Of course, it may be that His Majesty’s Government have no further need of his good offices. I am not assuming that they are necessary to His Majesty’s Gov ernment, but am merely using the history of Ibn Baud’s attitude on the point to show that his position seems to have become more difficult. 4. Ifas seems evident, the Palestine question has gradually forced Ibn Baud into a position where he cannot be as helpful’as lie would like to be to His Majesty’s Government, can it be guaranteed that, if the situation does not soon turn more to the advantage of the Arabs, he will not be obliged to become less and less friendly? I would not give any such guarantee, and 1 think it would be a mistake to trade too far upon his wish to maintain the friendliest relations with His Majesty’s Government. What will con stitute in Arab eyes a favourable turn is a difficult problem, but I fear that no scheme which does not call a final halt to Jewish expansion in Palestine, in some way or other, will have a chance of acceptance by the Arabs. I must admit that I myself favoured partition as a solution even before the Royal Commission began: its work, as placing a limit on Jewish expansion in the most definite way. Whether the suggested scheme of partition would have aroused less hostility, among the Arabs if the reservations made in the despatch of the 23rd December, 1937, had appeared in the Statement of Policy in July is an academic, question, but of the strength of the hostility now there is no doubt. Thee main difficulty is perhaps the complete dis belief which Arab spokesmen profess to have in the ability of His Maiestv’s Government to keep - the: Jews within any limits which may be fixed. Ibn Baud does not go so far as to say that His Majesty’s Government are under the thumb of the Jew, but he has expressed a vehement surprise at what he considers the unnatural and, indeed, irreligious combination of the Jews with His Majesty s Government. And the religious factor has great in fluence with him,- both because of his personal convictions and of -his vulnc rability, to criticism, both at home and abroad, on this score. 5. These remarks have grown out of what may well seem the foolish vapourings of a pan-Arab visionary of no influence. I do not share th^ view that the flight of six Saudi aeroplanes along the border would snAW to cause a revolt in Transjordan, but the suggestion that a revolt in T™n« Jordan might attract Saudi tribes and eventually win the acquiescence if not the support of Ibn Baud, is not necessarily to be scouted forever becau/a we can seout.it for the moment. uecause25 6.

Enclosure. 'Extract from a Note on a Conversation with M. Naidyonoff. The pilot, Ciccu, is ignored by the Saudi pilots, who do not even say good-morning to him (? on orders from the King). When Naidyonofi asks them why this rudeness they indicate that they don’t want any Italians. But one form of insult is no longer inflicted on Ciccii: he used to have to walk to the aerodrome, but Abdullah Sulaiman (Minister of Finance and Director of Defence) has now supplied him with a car. The only person who is friendly to Ciccu is Said-al-Kurdi, who is learning Italian from him, because, he says, it is bound to be useful in the next war, whichever side Saudi Arabia is on. Said-al-Kurdi is the only person who has a glimmering of understand ing of aviation, its uses, needs, limitations, etc. Abdullah Sulaiman is hopeless, but Kurdi listens, and also learns from experience. Kurdi is always telling Naidyonoff that if only the Saudi aeroplanes could fl} along the Transjordan frontier, so that the tribes there could see that the Saudis had an air force, there would be an immediate rising in Transjordan, which would spread to Palestine, and the Saudi tribes would take part. Naidyonoff asked Kurdi whether this was Ibn Saud’s policy. Kurdi said no, but if the movement started he would not stop it, but would have to back it up. Kurdi is very unpopular, but he is a single-minded fanatic on this subject and the young people listen to him. There is a tremendous amount of propaganda of this kind going on, designed to show that times are very difficult for His Majesty’s Government and that the opportunity should not be lost. Naidyonoff said that we ought to watch “night and day’’ in Trans jordan. ( 21 ) (Received on the 9th April 1938, with Political Secretary's letter No. 12, dated the 21+th March 1938.) Copy.

The Saudi Arabian Government were rather disturbed at the news about negotiations with Italy and I thought it well to convey assurance to them at once. They have replied in a note which will follow by bag. The chief point is an enquiry whether the Rome understanding of 1927 will be discussed and if so, whether His Majesty’s Government will persist in respecting it. 1 have reminded Fuad of recent assurances on this point and of the importance which the Italian Government also seem to attach to it and have said that I cannot imagine conversations having any result if successful but to confirm and even strengthen guarantee which the under standing affords to Saudi Arabia. The assurance just given should be sufficient as Fuad realises but to allay Ibn Saud’s nervousness you may like to make a specific statement on the point he raises. (23) Enclosure in Foreign Office, covering letter, dated the 4th May 1938. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, No. 64 (715/391/8), dated the 4th April 1938. I have the honour to inform you that the “Umm-al-Qura” of April 1st, announces that the Amir Khalid ibn Muhammad died near Riyadh in the early part of this week. The news had been received in Jedda from private sources a day or two before, and it was stated on good authority that the Amir had met with his death through an accident on a shooting expedition, being flung from his car while chasing gazelle. 2. The Amir Khalid was the son of the King’s brother Muhammad. He was reputed to be a determined enemy of his cousin the Amir Baud, the heir apparent who took him with him wherever he went—even on the recent visit to Bahrain—and kept a close watch on him. There will be those who will try to find something sinister in the story of the accident, and the omission of the cause of death from the official announcement may do something to strengthen this suspicion. I may mention in this connec tion that when the Amir Baud was with the Athlone party on the shooting expedition at Rumhiya, Mr. Gault noticed that when the Amir said his prayers with his followers and the other Arabs in the camp, an armed man who did not take part in the prayers stood behind him the whole time. 3 When the news appeared in the Mecca press I telegraphed my condo lences to the Amir Faisal, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, but I did not think the matter suitable for the British Broadcasting Corporation Arabic broadcast and therefore did not send the news for inclusion in the news bulletin. (24) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter dated the 5th May 1938. Letter from H. M.’s Minister, Jedda, No. 68 (765/270/2), dated the 11th April 1938. I have the honour to report the publication in the “Umm-al-Qura” of April 1st of a “Regulation concerning the wholesale and retail trade in medicines, drugs, medical preparations and herbs”. The regulation, which27 must have been copied straight from the statute-book of some highly orga nised state, is far too elaborate to be applied properly in this country, and I should hardly have thought it worth reporting but for one article which reads as follows :—• Article 21. The sale of proprietary medical preparations imported from abroad is prohibited, unless previous permission for the sale has been obtained, and the Public Health Department shall not authorise the sale without first taking specimens and ascertaining the composition, the effective medical substances which they contain, and the method of use. 2. Such British proprietary medical articles as to be found in this country must have a very small sale, but as even that small sale may be held up, if only for a time, by the promulgation of this regulation, 1 have thought the matter worth reporting. 3. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Department of Overseas 1 ’ Trade [No. 11. (766/270/2]. (25) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 12th May 1938. [E.-1701/196/25.} Letter from Sir R. Bullard, to Viscount Halifax.—(Received March 28), (No. 46), dated Jedda, March 11, 1938. I have the honour to inform you that Ibn Saud summoned me to a final audience to-day before his departure for Mecca and thence to Nejd for his annual holiday. I was thus able to convey in person to the King, as well as by letter to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the congratulations on the discovery of oil in Hasa which you sent in your telegram No. 37, dated the 9th March. The King was much pleased at this mark of sympathy and expressed his appreciation and thanks. I have since received a letter in the same sense, written on the King’s behalf, from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 2. What with the visit of Her Royal Highness Princess Alice and Lord Athlone, every detail of whose journey he follows personally with the great est interest, and the discovery of oil, the King was in an excellent humour. He talked a good deal about European politics, going to pieces over names like Czechoslovakia, but showing a shrewd knowledge of the situation, but he did not refer to the projected negotiations between His Majesty’s Gov ernment and the Government of Italy, as I had thought he might do. 3 Much of the talk was about the Yemen. The Imam, said the King, was always worrying about something. He made a lot out of Philby’s journey, and the other day he said that the British were working up to Nejran and asked what the King was going to do about it. This seemed to amuse the King, who always seems to find the Imam slightly ridiculous. He proceeded to criticise the Yemenis as thoroughly factious and savage and untrustworthy, and related various incidents in support of this thesis. He then talked about the Hadhramaut in the sense of the communication from Fuad Bey which I have reported in my despatch No. 39, dated the 8th March. I hope to have time before the bag closes to give the gist of the King’s remarks as a postscript to that despatch. 4. The King repeated the kind invitation which he gave me on the occasion of Lord Belhaven’s visit (my despatch No. 9, dated the 19th Jan uary) to spend some time with him in the desert next spring, if the rains should be good. As he pressed for a reply, I could only say that, if His Majesty did not mind my being no great sportsman, I should be very glad to come. It seemed to me that I might do more good in camp with the King for a week or so, than sitting at a desk in Jedda, and I trust that you will approve my general acceptance of the invitation.28 ( 26 ) D. 0.

It was entitled “The Future of Arabia” and dated the 18th September 1931. I made an addition to it dated the 23rd February 1933 in regard to Kuwait. 3. I entirely agree with you that so long as Ibn Saud lives there is rot much likelihood of a serious revolt, but as he gets older he may not be able to carry on his “one man show” with the vigour he displays at present, and the Arabs have a grim proverb : “When the camel stumbles (i.e., gets past its work) out comes the knife. ^ I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe and Peel.

It is now possible to complete the story of the death of the Amir Khalid, ^ nephew to Ibn Sand, which I had the honour to report to you in my despatch No. 61 (715/391/8), dated April 4th. The details given in the Kuwait Intelligence Summary for March 16th to 31st bear out the information obtained from Shaikh Hafiz Wehba, who was in Nejd at the time. A violent check to the car which he was driving at high speed flung the Amir against the wind-screen with such force that he died of his injuries a few days later, but he lived long enough to be seen alive by an American Mission ary doctor who had been sent for from Kuwait. 2. The Hejazi malcontent whose complaints I reported in my despatch No 78 (875/287/14), dated April 24th declared that the death of the Amir Khalid was not due to an accident, but had been planned long beforehand. The death of the chief rival to the Heir Apparent might well appear to hostile Arab eyes too fortunate to be accidental, and the fact that the cause of death was not mentioned in the reports in the Mecca press could be quoted as addi tional evidence. I do not think that any unprejudiced person here would accept the theory of a planned murder, but with persons so closely protect ed by armed guards as Ibn Saud or the Amir Sand, a hasty gesture of anger by a known enemy might possibly be misinterpreted by an armed slave and provoke a fatal shot or dagger-thrust. However, there is no question of this in the present case. ( 28 ) Foreign Office, S. W. 1. E.-2829/150/91. Reference demi-official letter P. Z.-2887/38, May 3rd. With Mr. Baxter’s compliments. J. P.

Shaikh Hafiz said that the Kino- still felt very sore about the Qatar boundary, and unable to reconcile our attitude with our professions. The King, according to Shaikh Hafiz, attributes the attitude of H. M. Government on this point entirely to the fact that the oil company operating in Hasa is American, and feels this all the more unjust in that he repeatedly tried to get British oil interests to put in for a conces sion there. I said that our attitude was based on historical considerations going back long before the days of oil, and spoke highly of the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, The final decision will probably have been taken before this letter reaches you, but I send the information nevertheless ‘To complete the record”.30 (29) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated 13th July 1938.

[enclosure to S- No. (26)], dated May 25th which has led me to look up your “Future of Arabia” of September 18th, 1931. It has always been supposed, I think that the Saudi regime was very much a one-man show and that’ anything might happen if Ibn Saud died, so that when I wrote my despatch No 78 of April 25th I felt that I was expounding the obvious. But the despatch arose out of the complaints of the Hejazi I quoted, and moreover I had been thinking about the possible effect on Saudi Arabia of a steady revenue froms n, 31 oil which might enable the ruler to pension all Nejd out of oil money and to leave the pilgrims to the Hejazis. I dealt with the point irt^dater de&amp;^ patch No. 83-E. (908/284/3) of April 30th last. What matters however, it seems to me, is what is to be done (1) now, in view of the Palestine tangle, and (2) if we become involved in a world conflict while Ibn Saud is still alive. I wish I could feel certain that no such conflict will come upon us within the next ten years, which is not an un reasonable period to give Ibn Saud : he may live and reign effectually for even longer. I am sending a copy of this letter, and of yours, to Baxter. ( 31 ) Enclosure in Foreign Office covering letter, dated the 20th August 1938. [E.-4187/196/25.} Letter from Sir P. Bullard, to Viscount Halifax. — (Received July 15), (No. 132), dated Jedda, June 28, 1938. I have the honour to enclose herewith a translation of an interesting announcement from the Umm-al-Qura, reporting that at a conference held in Riyadh in May it was agreed that a Higher Council of State should be set up and that the military system of the country should be reorganised on a more regular basis. 2. Why the new council is to be called the Higher Council of State is not made clear. There is at present a Legislative Assembly, and a stand ing committee of the Council of Ministers. The Legislative council seems to deal only with administrative, never with political questions. The other body apparently serves by standing, for, according to Euad Bey, who is a member of it. it does nothing else. The High Council of State is apparently to be consulted on political matters, since it is to consider “public affairs touching the State and its preservation.” While Ibn Saud makes his own decisions, he is quite right in claiming, as he has done on occasion, that he first listens to advice, and he listens to it openly in a manner which the European Dictators would consider ruinous to their reputations. It is, I think, legitimate to suppose that the council will be a safety-valve for its members, who can give their opinions on Palestine and the Arab world and European politics, and for the King a formal means by which he can make his opinions and decisions on questions of high policy known to the people. 3. In view of the forecast made in paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 103-E., dated the 22nd May, it is interesting to see that a standing army trained on more or less modern lines is to be created with the aid of oil revenues—for that is evidently the “economic resources” Ibn Saud has in mind. We have never been told what reply Ibn Saud returned to the Iraq proposal for the introduction of some measure of unification in the training and equipment of the two armies, but it is probable that that proposal will be taken into account when the tens of thousands of Arabs are assembled, clad in unaccustomed trousers, in their barracks. It may he some little time before the collection of oil royalties allows of a serious beginning with this plan, and it is therefore early to speculate whether the proposed force will be more efficient than tribal levies, and, if so, whether it will conduce to the stability of the Saudi regime by providing the ruler for the time being with a sure protection against any attempt to overthrow him. 4. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Cairo and Bagdad, and to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine at Jerusalem^(E.-4187/196/25.) Riyadh Conference for the year 1357. Establishment of a Higher Council of State, and a new Military Organisation in Nejd, (from the Umm-al- Qura of the 2Mh June, 1938). Our readers are aware that His Majesty the King is accustomed to call a general meeting every year at the time when crowds of people come to see him at Riyadh. Sometimes reports of this annual conference have been published, sometimes not. This year the conference was held about the middle of Rabi’-al-Awwal (about mid-May). It was attended by the amirs of the royal family, the ulama, important officials and thinking men. His Majesty the King, who presided over the conference, reviewed the home and foreign situation, and explained to all present the need, for caution and watchfulness, and for the adoption of such preparations as are commanded by the Quran. His Majesty also set forth the necessity to consider two matters for the maintenance of the state internally and externally. The first is the establishment of a Higher Council of State, to be con stituted in accordance with a special law, to consider public affairs touch ing the state and its preservation. The second is the examination of the Military organisation and the re placement of the present system by a new one whereby the forces in Nejd may become more useful and effectual. This can only be effected by giving troops a scientific training in special barracks so that there may (always) be under training some tens of thousands of men (ready) to move at the order of their commander-in-chief in any direction, supported by the reserve forces in the country. His Majesty stated that he had only been prevented from putting this proposal into effect earlier by the shortage in the state revenue, and that, believing that this financial crisis would now be resolved by the revenue to be expected from economic resources in this country, he thought it necessary to hurry on with the business. His Majesty’s statements were received by all with delight and joy, and his proposals were unanimously supported and approved. His Majesty therefore issued orders for the necessary preparations to be made to put the two schemes into effect. We pray that Allah may bestow on this country and other Arab coun tries what may strengthen Islam and Moslems in general and the Arabs in particular, and that he may preserve His Majesty and keep him as a treasure to Islam and to the Arabs.
