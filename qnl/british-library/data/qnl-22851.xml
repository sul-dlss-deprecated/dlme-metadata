Previously the Agency possessed a steamboat, the 'John Lambert', which was sold in 1933 or 1934 for Es. 700/- which was credited to the Government. The 'Felix Jones' was the Bandar i Abbas Consulate launch and was brought to Bahrain and handed over to the Political Agent for use by the Agency with the knowledge of the Government of India (vide letter No.2263 dated the 1st November 1933 from the Political Resident to the Government of India). The Political Agent built a new boat locally and furnished r it with fittings from the 'Felix Jones', which was broken up. The engine, a Thbrnycroft, 76 h.p., was purchased locally and in stalled in the new craft which is still called the 'Felix Jones'. The purchase was made without the knowledge of the Government of India from the Agency Funds and launch grant. This was in 1933-34. This engine is now no longer dependable. It also consumes an ex cessive amount or fuel. It is therefore very necessary for the / Agency launch to have a new engine and it is suggested that funds may be asked for to enable me to purchase a new one. The local agent for Kelvin engines quotes a 66 h.p. model kerosene engine at about £ 680/-. This is a suitable model for large sea-going launches. (b) 'Diana'. This is a small launch for harbour work, fitted with a 16 h.p. Kelvin engine and was built in 1931. The life of this • machine has also expired and it is getting very troublesome. The price of a new engine for this craft is quoted at £ 200/- and I iSqweet that funds be to enable me to buy a new one as early possible. i { ^ J tUl! Y) V.k. Bahrain.

THE BERGIUS COMPANY, LTD., 254 BOBBIE'S LOAN, GLASGOW, C.4. January, 1938.FOREWORD In 1904 we started business as the Bergius Car and Engine Company, our product being a four-cylinder pleasure car having low tension magneto ignition. The manufacture of cars was soon abandoned and the engine altered to suit marine conditions. Our first models were thus evolved, and soon established a reputation for reliability. Although designed 30 years ago these engines still sell freely. The first Kelvin engine to be installed in a yacht was recently acquired by us after 29 years of service In 1907 our folding side propeller was first applied to a sailing vessel. From then onward began a revolution in the fishing industry of this country in which Kelvin Engines have always played the leading part. Of all the uses to which motor engines are put, service in a Scotch fishing boat is probably the most severe—50 hours per week throughout the year; long periods at full speed ; hours upon end of slow running on paraffin; exposure to salt water and dirt; maintenance by unskilled labour. The Kelvin-Ricardo Engine is intended to work under these conditions, and to do so with a greater degree of efficiency than has hitherto been attained by any engine consuming paraffin. Our plant is the most up-to-date devoted to marine engines in this country Our output of engines to date is 19,633. Our stores contain the parts of every model—4,387 varieties at the moment. No Kelvin engine, however old, need be superseded for want of parts. This unique service accounts for the fact that Kelvins remain saleable after many years of service,903 General Description These are four-cycle engines with loose head and poppet valves. They are built to withstand continuous full load and have all useful refinements— high efficiency, silence, oil tightness, absence of heat and smell. They are built in 6 models, E and F in two types—one to consume self vaporising oil such as petrol, gasolene, or benzene, the other to consume oils which require heat to vaporise them such as paraffin, petroleum, or kerosene. All models comply with the requirements of Lloyd's and the Board of Trade. POVVER—Each engine is tested and is guaranteed capable of developing within 3 per cent, of the power, speed and consumption stated. An extract from the test record is furnished to a purchaser on request. WORKMANSHIP—The machine work is equal in quality to that prevailing ~ in automobile engines of the highest class. All parts are hand finished—noU sharp edges. CYLINDERS—In pairs with detachable heads, priming valve for each cylinder, eye bolt for each pair. Barrels machine ground - very efficient. VALVES—Of chrome-nickel steel, completely enclosed —silent and oil tight, valve guides separate from cylinder—renewable. CAMSHAFT—With cams integral, removable along with cylinder. Bearings of bronze split for adjustment. Every cam close beside a bearing—no whip—clearance a minimum—silence. Gears of steel driven by roller chain. CARBURETTORS—Dripless at all speeds. Unaffected by a list to port or starboard of 25 degrees, or by a rake of shaft up to 1 in 9, or by a head of fuel up to 8 feet. Jets removable without stopping engine. Models E and F have one carburettor per pair of cylinders. Models G have a carburettor for each cylinder. VAPORISER—Kept hot by copper-asbestos cover. WAFER REGULATOR—At full speed the water passes from the pump via the exhaust manifold to the cylinder, thence to the silencer. When running slow most of the water passes direct to the silencer. This method of control keeps the cylinders hot and the exhaust pipe cool. SLOW RUNNING ON PARAFFIN—A feature of these engines due to the ^ asbestos cover over the vaporiser, and the water regulator. The engines* will run for indefinite periods at one-fourth of normal load. LUBR1CAI ION—Automatic. The oil supply is carried in the crankcase below the reach of the cranks. A pump supplies a drip situated in the path of each revolving crank. A dip rod indicates the level. The filling pipe has a gauze of sufficient area to pass cold oil. The engine may be inclined to the extent of 1 in 9. OIL PUMP—Of gun metal, plunger type, with ball valves and gauze strainer. CRANKCASE PUMP—To empty the crankcase as necessary to maintain the quality of the lubricating oil. CRANKSHAFT—Of nickel steel—very hard. The four-cylinder model has tinee bearings, the two-cylinder model two bearings, of white metal split for adjustment (patent). The crank pins are hollow to reduce unbalanced weight. BALANCE The two-cylinder models have balance weights on the crank- shait and cause no more vibration than the four-cylinder models. FLYWHEEL—Balanced and of ample weight for running slow. Flvwheel pan to protect flywheel from bilge water. SIARIING HANDLE—At rear end as shown or at front end if preferred in which position it becomes left-handed to operate. The chain is not in motion unless at starting.904 PISTONS-Of iron with three rings, bronze bushed, hardened pin. CONNECTING RODS—Of steel H section—very light. Big ends of white metal split for adjustment. Bolts of nickel steel. CRANKCASE—In one piece—permits of large inspection doors—also rigid and oiltight. White enamelled inside—easy to clean out. EXHAUST MANIFOLD air cooled on Models E, water cooled on F and G—prevents overheating of engine-room and warping of woodwork. IGNITION—Models E—By magneto, driven by enclosed chain, quickly adjustable. Stopping terminal on top of cylinder. IGNITION—Models F and G-By magneto, driven by enclosed chain, mounted in a special manner which provides a larger range than is usual— greater safety in starting, and more advance for full speed. These features are attained by rotating the whole magneto instead of merely the contact breaker. Stopping terminal on top of cylinder. IMPULSE STARTER working in conjunction with magneto produces a rapid movement of the armature at starting and ceases automatically to act when the engine starts. Models F and G only. CONTROL—A centrifugal governor, entirely enclosed, controls the throttle valve and takes care of the engine speed when the clutch is out. Models G only. Hand levers control governor and magneto. The reversing gear is controlled by a gun metal hand-wheel. DECK CONTROL—For the control of clutch and throttle from deck or cockpit a variety of fittings may be supplied. (See installation sheet No. 6). WATER PUMP—Of uni-flow type—noiseless. Plunger cotton packed—sand resisting. Pump fixed sufficiently low to be submerged in the shallowest of boats—reliable. STRAINER—Combined with the seacock is a strainer which may be cleared from inboard without stopping the engine. REVERSE GEAR—Attached direct to engine—permanent in alignment. The ahead clutch is double in Models F and G, the astern clutch single. Both of cast-iron. The thrust both ahead and astern is taken on ball bear- 4 ings situated within the case which is white enamelled inside and oil tight. ILENCER of our well-known pattern in which the circulating water and exhaust gases mix together—discharge almost inaudible —silencer and exhaust pipe never more than hand hot. This silencer must be above sea level. For deep boats a standpipe to raise it is furnished without extra charge. Silencer may be at front end if preferred. ACCESSIBILITY—All running parts liable to damage are enclosed, yet the accessibility is good, a piston and connecting rod may be removed and replaced through the inspection door in 7 minutes. All crank bearings are adjustable through the inspection door. Crankshaft comes out at either end. Any repair can be carried out without removing engine from boat. SCREW THREADS—The British Standard Fine Thread is used throughout (except for pipes) in preference to the Whit worth thread now out of date except for rough work. Studs are used in place of set screws. The small ones are of rustless material. EQUIPMENT—Propeller of bronze balanced by a special process. Stern- tube of naval brass with outside stuffing box—excludes sand. Shaft bearings of gunmetal split for adjustment. All pipes of copper. Tool outfit very com plete. (See pages 918-920). BOAT BUILDERS—The installation of a ' Kelvin ' equipment involves no engineering work, and can be undertaken in a few hours by a carpenter with his ordinary tools. The pipes, being copper, can be bent by hand. The fittings are designed to require neither screwing nor brazing. The shafting may be cut to length by a hand saw.905 Kelvin-Ricardo Engine and Marine Equipment Model E2 with 2 Cylinders. 7| Horse-Power.

Dear eJta/of, I attacli lierewitli some information on the 'Shahin', which may 'be of interest. As regards figures of cost, I understand wood has gone up slightly only, but a more serious matter is the increase in wages to carpenters (Rs.1/4 per day in 1936, now Rs.2/4 per day) You will remember that I suggested an 88 horse power engine. In 1936, we paid £.600/- odd for a 66 h.p., and in 1937 the Company bought an 88 h.p. for the Shaikh Of Dubai at a cost of £.835/-. Yours sincerely. End. Major R. G.

RUSTON Publication 7757 (Reprint 4) Small Vertical Oil Engines 3i/4 btir.p., 5/5^ b.h.p. and 7^/8^ b.h.p. per cyl. Class VYO, VTO &amp; VSO (Cold Starting, using Light Diesel Fuel) EASY HAND STARTING The ease with which engines in this series can be started is one of their outstanding features. The engine is turned by hand with the compression fully released. Practically no physical strength is required. When sufficient speed has been attained (usually after three turns) the fuel pump is brought into action and full compression is put on. The engine fires instantly. LOW FUEL CONSUMPTION The simple, straightforward but well thought out design of the combustion chamber gives highly efficient combustion, which is reflected in the very economical running of these engines, which run effectively on distillate fuels having a specific gravity not greater than 0.88 and a viscosity not greater than 50 seconds at 100 o F. (Redwood No. 1). CLEAN RUNNING Because of the efficient combustion the engine is very clean internally, and will run for long periods without de-carbonizing or cleaning. PISTON RINGS The design and running performance of these engines ensures clean running, gives free working piston rings and prevents the sticking of rings so common in many high speed engines. to the lasting LONG LIFE The factors which contribute qualities of these engines are :— (1) Smooth running due to sound design. (2) Simplicity and freedom from delicate points. (3) First-class materials and workmanship. ACCESSIBILITY All parts are readily accessible for inspection and, if necessary, adjustment. The cylinder head covers are easily removable giving full access to valve gear and fuel system. Large doors are provided in the engine housing.IMPORTANT FEATURES Atomiser remov able without drain ing water jacket. Valve stems fitted Forged steel crankshaft withdrawn from end of housing. Special Exhaust Valve Guide prevents valve from sticking. Combustion Chamber is de signed to promote turbulence and to give complete combustion of fuel and instant starting from cold. Floating Gudgeon Pin. Gear type lub ricating oil pump gives positive lubrication. Special hardened renewable cylinder liners ensuring long life and minimum wear.

Dear Sir, Please refer to your letter of MaylSth regarding repairs to the Thornycraft engine installed in the Agency launch 'Pelix Jones* 1 . Before the engine is sent to Awali for repair will you please have your engineer ascertain the following: 1. Do the cylinders have removable liners? 2. If so, are there any spare liners available in Manama? 3. If the liners are not removable, are there sufficient oversize pistons and rings for replacement available? We feel certain that loose-fitting rings and pistons are the principal cause of your high rate of oil consumption, but we can do nothing in the way of repair unless you have the above material on hand. We can probably weld up the cracked silencer chamber. Chief Local Representative THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LTD. fJJNo .978-3/6 Political Agency, Bahrain. 26th May. 1941.

Dear Sir, We thank you for your letter No.1304/3/6 of the 8th instant in connexion with our quotation for an 88 H # P # Kelvin Diesel Marine Engine. Our price includes the Indian Duty and also for removing the engine from the craft and packing. The stern gear is also included in the price. We do not think there would be any chance for a duty rebate 6n this engine because it was imported and actually used. Had it only been in stock a percentage of the duty paid would be refunded.

Yours faithfully, B.R.HERMN &amp; MOHATTA LTD. B 3B:HF . ^DIRECTOR.O.C.No.1468-3/6 Dated the 28th July, 1941. I forward you herewith a copy of the plan and elevation of the nm launch* It has been prepared after a great deal of consultation \tfith various people and after examining moat of the launches in Bahrain. 2» From the plan it will be seen that a kitchen and pantry adjoin the main cabin on the after side* The roofs of these two will be level with the roof of the nvain cabin, which is 7 feet above the deck. Between the two will be a raised cabin for the flteercman from which he will be ©ble to see in all directions over the top of everything. A. little difficulty was encountered in trying to fit the engine into the hull and it had to be put somewhal further aft than usual. It is proposed f however, to try and move it forward slightly Into the cavity beneath the steersman's cabin which will neaaseariity have to be raised above the deck line. If this can be done the forward edge of the engine will rest almost in the centre of the craft. The position of the water tank and the saloon in the forward part of the ship will, I hope, compensate for the weight of the engine and the after part of the craft is further lightened by haviiig the deck flush all the way to the stem instead of having a raised pocp as is customary on some launches. 3. '.'.Tie work of building is confuencing and Jackson, who has a copy of this plan, together with our own launch engineer, will superintend the progress of the ^ork. The cost of building, without the srloon and fittings which we will put in ourselves, has been agreed upon at H3.5000/*, which is moderate in view of the rise in cost of labour, materials, etc., owing to the war. 4. I thought these plans might be of some use to the Residency and these copies are spares and need not be returned. Yours sincerely. The Hon f ble ht. Colonel V ad/-R.G.E.-7. Alban. C. G.

Khalil Bin Ebrahim Kanoo, Bahrein, Dear Sirs, We have delayed in replying to your letter of July 5rd, as it has taken sometime to.canvas the potential suppliers of the Diesel Engine on which you requested a quotation. We regret to advise that although we have contacted with every possible supplier, we have not been able to obtain a definite quotation from anyone, Messrs, Volkart Brothers are the only ones who indicate any interest at all and they state that they do not have current valid prices for Blackstone Marine Engines, They further advise that they are unable to quote for the Bahrein Islands without first referring the matter to the manufacturers. They also indicate that they seriously doubt whether delivery could be obtained without having a priority certificate. Unless it is for definite Government requirements such a certificate is almost impossible to obtain. If, in spite of these limitations, you are interested, I suggest that you write to Messrs, Volkart Brothers in Bombay. Messrs, Kilburn &amp; Co. are Agents for Crossley Bros. Ltd., Openshaw, Manchester, England, and they suggest that you may wish to write direct to the manufacturers. However, they state that unless the Engine is required for some work of National importance and you obtain a priority certificate, they doubt that supplies will be available during the war. I am very sorry that we are unable to give you any further information, but assure you that we have made every possible v effort to find a supplier of the type of Engine you require.

(ise IX)/toi/8664 Dear 6th August, 1941. PERSIAN GULF. Major Alban was inquiring one day from me about a few simple rules for running in a new engine. Dickson has sent over the following five (1) After the engine has been run in for 2 to 3 hours it should be opened to full throttle for about 10 minutes and the revolutions checked. If the engine does not develop the rated R.P .M. as specified by makers it indicates that the propeller is too large and should be trimmed down a little at a time until rated R.P .M. is obtained. Boat building in England and the Persian Gulf are vastly different and engines built in England are mostly rated for British built boats and it is advisable to check engines for propeller rating and R.P.M. to avoid overloading engines {R.P.M. revolutions per minute). (2) Before starting engine check oil level in crankcase, reverse gear and all oil and grease cups. Only oil of the correct grade and best quality should be used. Oil must be maintained at correct level at all times. (5) See that fuel is clean and of correct grade. (4) See that water pump intake strainer is kept clean and an adequate supply of circulating water is passed through engine during operation to keep it at correct temperature. (5) For the first 50 hours of operation a new engine should be operated at three quarter throttle and careful watch kept to see that nothing runsb~* z - r4sc D0/S^i/8664 (concld.) unduly hot. It is never advisable to operate a launch engine at full throttle continuously. A normal cruising rate of 50 to 100 R.P.M. below rated R.P.M. should be maintained. The most economical cruising rate with the least R.P.M. below rated engine capacity can only be arrived at by tests and throttle setting should be marked at this point. Yours sincerely, G. N.

THE WORLD OVER MORE PEOPLE RIDE ON GOODYEAR TYRES THAN ON ANY OTHER MAKEAt 800 R.P.M. with OIL-OPERATED REVERSE-REDUCTION GEARS. SPECIFICATION 'A'—ENGINE. GENERAL. The engine is of the four-cycle, cold- starting, solid injection, vertical type. All working parts are totally enclosed, but easy of access. BEDPLATE AND COLUMN. Strongly ribbed, separate iron castings with large inspection doors, giving easy access to all working parts, and having separate sump and oil level indicator. MAIN BEARINGS. Adjustable, one being provided on each side of each crank. Shells are of malleable iron lined with best quality white metal, and give large bearing surfaces. CRANKSHAFT. Of Siemens-Martin acid process steel, in excess of Lloyds' requirements, and balanced to ensure vibrationless running. CYLINDER HEADS. Detachable heads of original design (Patent No. 361,202) are fitted, in which the high degree of turbulence obtained ensures perfect com bustion at all loads and speeds. They are of a special chrome alloy cast-iron. CYLINDER LINERS. Renewable, of special close- grained cast-iron, honed to finished diameter. PISTONS. Of special close-grained cast-iron, and ground to finished size. Specially designed for working in conjunction with the patent cylinder heads. Fitted with bronze bushes for piston pins. PISTON PINS. Of the floating type, being free to rotate in both pistons and connecting rods. Case- hardened and ground to size. CONNECTING RODS. Forged from Siemens-Martin acid process mild steel, circular in section, and drilled for lubricating the small ends under pressure. The large ends, which are of the marine type and adjustable, are of steel, white metal lined. The small ends are fitted with phosphor bronze bushes, which are stepped to give maximum bearing surfaces on the thrust faces. VALVES. Horizontally disposed in head, the inlet valve being carried in a renewable valve cage, whilst the exhaust valve operates in a renewable guide. Both valves can be removed without disturbing the cylinder head or breaking any pipe connection. VALVE GEAR. Valves are operated by twin camshafts in the crankcase, through vertical push-rods and rockers, all totally enclosed but easy of access. Tappets are of the mushroom type and, like the cams, are case-hardened and ground. FUEL PUMP AND ATOMISERS. The self-contained pump unit has a separate plunger for each of the atomisers which are of the self-cleaning type and interchangeable. FLYWHEEL. Of the disc type, specially proportioned for marine work and placed at the aft end of the engine. GOVERNOR. Of the totally enclosed centrifugal type, enabling the engine to be set to run at any speed within a wide range, and keeping it at that speed independent of external conditions. Arranged for either engine room or remote control. LUBRICATION. Force-fed by means of a gear-wheel type pump, and through an auto-cleaning strainer. Pressure is controlled by a spring relief valve and a gauge is fitted in a suitable position. A hand-wheel is provided for rotating the pump for priming before starting. OIL COOLER. A separate oil cooler of efficient design is provided in the lubricating oil circuit. This is of adequate dimension, ensuring the temperature of the oil being kept at a suitable level, even under tropical conditions. WATER CIRCULATING PUMP. Of the recipro cating type, running at quarter engine speed. Made in gun-metal throughout, with valves easy of access. The National Gas and Oil Engine Co. Ltd., Ashton-under-Lyne, England TURNER, HOARE, &amp; CO., LTD., Gateway Building, Apollo Bunder, BOMBAY. Branches - Ahmedabad &amp; Lahore.MATIONAL~ MARINE HEAVY OIL ENGINES BILGE PUMP. Interchangeable with above, by the operation of a single cock, and provided with a simole hand-clufch for disengaging when not in use. WINCH, CAPSTAN OR DYNAMO DRIVE. The forward end of the crankshaft is arranged so that it can take a half coupling for driving shafting for winches, etc., if required, or for taking a pulley for a dynamo drive. The half coupling or the pulley are charged extra, and if either are required must be specified when ordering. STARTING. The standard system of starting is direct rotation by means of an auxiliary engine, which is included under Specification ' A ' With the ''MVM3 and ' MVM4 ' engines we supply a ' DSS ' type 7^ b.h.p. heavy oil engine, whilst with the ' MVM5 ' and ' MVM6 ' type engines a ' ID ' type heavy oil engine developing 8f/9j b.h.p. is us6d. Both these engines are of the single-cylinder four-stroke totally enclosed type, starting by hand from cold and operating on the same fuel as the main engine. The auxiliary engine operates a ' Bendix ' drive of the type employed on motor cars, by means of a belt and fast and loose pulleys mounted on the ' Bendix ' spindle which is carried on the main engine. A lever throws the belt on to the fast pulley, which causes the ' Bendix ' pinion to engage with a steel toothed rim on the main engine flywheel—thus rotating and starting the main engine. This arrangement is shown in the drawing on page 4. Both the auxiliary and main engines are fitted with compression release gear and starting is immediate, no preheating devices being required. Cooling of the 7 b.h.p. engine Is effected by thermo- syphon, the main engine silencer jacket being used as a reservoir. In cases where a water injection type silencer is supplied a small header tank is provided, through which passes the outlet water from the main engine. The 8^/9J b.h.p. auxiliary engine is fitted with a-plunger type gunmetal water circulating pump. The auxiliary engines can be supplied with an extra pulley for any additional drive at a slight extra cost. REVERSE GEAR. This is of the National Oil-operated Reverse-reduction type, the many special features and advantages of which are described in separate literature. This gear is self-contained and is mounted on an extension of the engine bedplate, making the engine and gear-box, in effect, a single unit. The drive is taken from the engine through a flexible coupling, which ensures a smooth drive and freedom from alignment troubles. Gearboxes with reduction ratios of 2/1 and 3/1 are available for all the engines of this series giving propeller speeds of 400 or 267 r.p.m., whilst the 5 or 6 cylinder models can also be supplied with a 4|/l reduction ratio giving a propeller speed of 168 r.p.m. The gearbox is water jacketed and the cooling is effected from the engine circulating system. The primary shaft of the gearbox can be extended to provide a drive for say a small dynamo or compressor (see ' Extras ') if specified when ordering. EXHAUST SILENCER. A silencer is supplied, either of the water jacketed or water injection type, at cus tomer's option. EXHAUST AND WATER MANIFOLDS.

End:SUPERSCAVENGE MARINE DIESEL ENGINES ihPETTER MARINE DIESEL ENGINES The very latest development of this Company—the ' Superscavenge ' Marine Engine has created wide interest amongst the most discriminating and exacting of marine engineers and owners. Many unique features—so essential for chis particular duty—are incorporated in a design which The ' Superset 4, 5 and 6 cylinder 120 to 360 S.H.P., has for Direct or Dies( or Auxiliary Duties— ideal for Coastal and medium size com mercial vessels, tankers, tugs, ferries, fishing vessels, cruisers and yachts ; as the Power Unit of an auxiliary, it is capable of meeting a wide range of requirements. Robust construction and accessibility, combined with reliability and economical operation have not been sacrificed in achieving the outstanding performance of ' Superscavenge ' engines—these Marine Power Units are the result of exhaustive years of wide In the forefront, is the small overall size of these engines—very much less than that of any other engine of comparable output. Robust monobloc design is em ployed throughout the range, and for accessibility, separate detachable cylinder heads and large inspection covers are ' The ample proportions of ^s also make 5 engine for e by means of an extension shaft. Considerable thought has been given to a totally-enclosed system which reaches all parts of the engine. Essential features, such as a safety device to shut off fuel supply in the event of an excessive drop in the oil pressure, together with oil-cooler and a built-in 'Streamline' filter which thoroughly cleanses the oil, are fitted as standard. The powerful centrifugal Governor f ites throughout the entire speed range L THE WORKING CYCLE The complete cycle of operations is performed in one revolution of the engine crankshaft.

No. 1469-3/6 dated the 28th July 1941 regarding the plans of your new launch. \ v; % 1 4SsS A if % &gt;* s 2. The plan seems to me to show a number of defects which you will find seriatim below. My own view, as you know, is that little variation from the standard design is possible in a hull of this length and that emphasis is always placed on the saloon and the launch sacrificed to it whereas it is only required for about 10 days out of the 365. For the remainder cf the year a canvas roofed piece of deck is infinitely preferable. The objections I see are; (a) The saloon will get a great deal of spray in heavy weather and if the windows, which are almost dangerously large, are ope^the saloon will be drenched. If they are closed, there is a chance Major R.G.E.W. Alban, O.B.E. , Political Agent, Bahrain. /ofof their being broken. As so mucii space is given to tlie saloon the passengers must make use of it since no open space is left except for the little piece of deck in front of it which slopes steeply. (b) I am afraid that the placing of the water tank so far forward will give rise to hogging since it will exert great leverage in this position. More over with the water tank here there seems to be no place for a chain locker and a launch of this size will require a heavy chain which will take up a good deal of room. The saloon is, of course, valueless as a counterpoise to the engine. (c) It appears from the plan that the kitchen and pantry are each Zi' wide. A pantry of width is a possibility, but I do not know what anyone can do with a kitchen of this size. (d) If we assume that the helmsman's eye is one foot below the roof bf his steering box he will not be able to see the bows of the launch as it is obsfc ur ed by the roof of the saloon. You may assume that the helmsman's eye will be no higher than this as otherwise he will bump his head on the roof every time the launch /pitchespitches. Also he is going to find it extremely hot in this sentry box. (e) I do not believe that there is any practicable alternative to having the engine in the centre of the launch if the launch is made locally in Bahrain. The further it is away from the centre the greater is the strain on the hull, and since you have placed the counterpoise of the water tank in the extreme bows, a great deal of torsion will have to be taken up by the keel, (f) I think the stern will prove a source of weakness as it appears to be different to the types understood locally. I would myself have preferred the normal Jollyboat style which is well understood and is a design that has stood up to everything that To sum up 1 do not believe that there is any advantage in abandoning the normal jollyboat design has been asked from it. for a launch of this si ze, and placing the passengers f orrard. However, your e.peri^nt is an interesting I hone, nrnvo , one and win, I hope, prove interesting . 1 hope, prove successful.CONTRACTORS TO GOVERNMENT. branches s lahore. bhavnagar. quetta. bom bay. delhi. calcutta.

Unfortunately they have been unable to do so and it is now probable that the engine has been destroyed in the Bombay fire. Grateful if Government of India caj.be asked to verily that the engine has actually been destroyed and if s^ they will make available from their own stocks an 88 E*F Kelvin engine. It will take at least six months to obtain a- replacement from the United Kingdom and I feel that if effective action had been talc en by them at any time during the past five months we should now have the engine in Bahrain. - Political SAF.

Hickinbotham C.I.E, O.B.E, Political Agent, Bahrain, A .C. On 15th September I received your telegram reading as follows. ' Please advise me about carpenters for working on launch cabins and rates of their wages' I have understood its contents and was honoured by it. I at once called carpenters out of whom I selected two who are very good. One of them is Yacoob bin Yusuf, the best carpenter in making doors and cabins. I dicussed with them the question of wages without food. The least that they would accede to was Rs. 25/- for Yacub and Rs. 20/- for the other per day. This would come into effect from the day they leave Kuwait to the day of their return ( both days inclusive) and on the 16th instant I telegraphed to you of the above arrangement. On the 19th I received a reply from you stating that the wages were too high for local rates, and inquiring if any further reduction could be obtained. I have tried my best to obtain good carpenters for less wages. So if it is agreeable to you at this rate please let me know so that I may send them. so Those who are not/good and would accept Rs. 15 to 16 per day would not be suitable to you. Nevertheless a carpenter ordinarily receives from Rs.l5 to Rs.l6 per day in Kuwait and he is fed as well by the employer. safe I tender my congratulations on your/arrival from India.
