For the most convenient way of travelling is to fly out by Imperial Airways, and it is really not much more expensive than the long way round. If you want a cheaper way the train journey via Constantinople is, I am told, reasonably comfortablej some people go second class but that means a two berth compartment with possible horrors. 3. I am arranging to get you an house, as owing to competition from the Oil Company, it would be unwise to wait even a month or so. While you are making your arrangements, my wife and I will be delighted to put you up. 4. There is electricity - 230 volt - 50 cycle, A.C. 5. No servants of the better class (bearers, cooks etcetera) are available and it would be well to get your own ( if you have any in India) to come down. If you will give me their addresses, I will send them no objection certificates to enable them to travel without difficulty. 6. Drinks you can buy for the present locally till you see what you want. Stores can be got but are expensive and I should send out a supply from Home. Flour, sugar and rice are obtainable locally. Vegetables are difficult to get in the hot weather so a fair supply of tinned stuff....stuff is desirable, 7. If you have a motor I should be inclined to bring it - but if not, wait till you see the place, as you can use taxis at a pinch. 8, The hot weather is upon us so far as clothes are concerned, and hot weather uniform is necessary for official visits* By the way, the greatest comfort I know is a stuff called 'Qossamatex' produced by Lewin, 15 Panton Street, 9» Tennis and golf are the local games and I hope to build a Squash Court. 10• it is no use bringing guns etcetera as there is no shooting at all. The import of arms is prohibited, though I could arrange for yours to be landed if you have them with your kit. 11. There is no real deep sea fishing here but if you have sea rods etcetera, bring them as one might get some when on tour in a sloop. 12. No glass, crockery, linen, cutlery is available. 13. The best way of shipping heavy kit or stores from Home is by the direct Steamers of Frank C. Strick Limited. Yours sincerely, (j. Loch.

Sir, With reference to : the correspondence ending with your letter No.868-1/24 dated the 18th May 1935, I have the honour to state that it appears that Mr. Worth was employed at Gyantse before proceeding on leave in 1933 but transported his personal effects from Gangtok, a place other than his headquarters. The circumstances in which this was done may kindly be explained. 2. The rate for the trasportation of personal effects by road between Gongtok and -fi^ii^-^Khola is -/I/- per maund per mile and he is accordingly entitled to Rs.32/6/- on the aboyp account instead of Rs.84/- as actually claimed. 3. Further, he is entitled to the cost of • transportation of his personal effects by goods train at owners risk rate between AiellTc\Khola ano Calcutta, The amount overdrawn on this account, if any, as well as the amount due to him on account of the cost of Air passage will also be communicated on receipt of information about the railway freight obtaining between these two places.4. It has been ascertained from the Accountant 1 General, Bengal that the cost of unused half of the passage ticket amounting to £.47/- has been credited in his passage account which has not thus bee:! debited with the cost of his return journey on compulsory recall from England in April 1934, I have the honour to be.

The Shaikh was sitting on a chair in the down stair verandah and took us up to the majlis* I think that he was doing this in order to get the cool breeze, as he would ordinarily ha'se met us at the top of the stairs. The Political Agent and the Shaikh sat on a sofa and the Assistant Political Agent on a chair et his right. Shaikh (Abdullah was present. The call lastea about a *• uarter^ of an hour and the usual courtesies were observed. On leaving the Shaikh shook hands at the top of the stairs. 4. The return call was paid at the Agency on the same day about a quarter of an hour later and Shaikh 'Abdullah accompanied His Excellency. The usual courtesies were observed. The Peii^ieai and Assistant Political Agent stood with the Political Agent at the top of the stairs to meet the Shaikh and accompanied him to the top of the stairs when saying goodbye. 5.
