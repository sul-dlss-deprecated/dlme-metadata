At its 55th Meeting, the Sub-Committee agreed: To ask the Secretary ? Committee of Imperial Defence, to invite the Chiefs of Staff Sub committee to consider the strategical aspects of a road between Haifa and Baghdad, to report on the degree of priority to be assigned to such a project in relation to the defence programmes generally, and, if the construction of such a road is recommended, to report on the type of road required. A Draft Report was accordingly prepared by the Joint Planning Sub-Committee (Paper No. C.O.S. 677) and considered by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee at its 228th Meeting, Minute 1. The Sub~Comir.ittee agreed: To instruct the Secretary to circulate the Report amended in the light of the discussion for approval. 3. The following extracts are taken from the Report prepared in accordance with the above conclusions. Para. 6. 'It is therefore of great importance from the military point of view that the route should be developed.' Para. 7. 'We therefore consider that the construction of this road should be assigned a high priority.'3&gt; - 2 - Para-, 8 e ,!

Minute 4 and agreed: (a) To recommend the proposal for the construction of a road from Haifa to Baghdad, at a cost of approximately £.600.000 for approval by the Cabinet e (b) That the priority to be assigned to the construction of the read should be decided by the Cabinet in connection with the general review which the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence would shortly present* 5. Sub s e quently the Cabinet (9(33)) these recommendations were laid before and the following Conclusions v/ere recorded. (a) To approve the construction of the proposed rot-.d and its expenditure, as set forth in recommendation (a) above, not only for the strategical reasons set forth in the Report before the Committee of Imperial Defence but as a great Imperial project calculated to consolidate and strengthen our position through out the Middle Bast, and to improve not only our military but also our commercial communications between Sgypt, Palestine, Trans-Jordania, Iraq and India: (b) That &gt; as recommended by the Committee of Imperial efence, the priority to be assigned to the construction of the road should be decided by the Cabinet in connection vrith the general reviev/ which the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence would shortly present:* (c) To take note that the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence deduced from the Cahinet discussion and Conclusions the strong impression that their intention was that he should give tne Hoad a sufficient priority to enable it to be carried out at an early date: (d) That the financial aspects of the Hoad should be considered by the Treasury in conjunction with the Departments concerned, including - (i) the incidence of cost on Depart mental Estimates, bearing in mind the importance of avoiding giving the impression that the Hoad was being built exclusively for strategical reasons: (ii) the suggestion made at the Meeting that the Iraq Petroleum Company should be asked to make a contri bution. © At a later Cabinet (14(38)) the question of the Baghdad - Haifa road was again raised by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, and the Cabinet agreed: (a) That the whole cost of the road should be borne on the Vote for Colonial and Middle East Services. (b) That for the purposes of the defence programme f100,000 should be regarded as Civil expenditure and the balance of the cost should be chargeable to the total sum allocated to the Defence D ep ar tme nts, (Signed) F.3.

THE SUB-COI/uHITTSE had under consideration the following Papers:- Paper No. M.E.(O) 245 - Letter from the Air Ministry dated 12th November, 1936, to the Colonial Offico forwarding their proposals for the construction of the road between Haifa and Baghdad at a cost of £210,000. paper No. M.E.(O) 246 - Despatches dated 26th November, 10th December and 17th December,1936, between the Colonial Office and the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan in regard to the Air Ministry proposals. Paper No. M.E.{0) 247 - Letter from the Treasury dated 4th March, 1937 to the Colonial Office agreeing to the construction of a road between Haifa and Baghdad at an estimated cost of £200,000 for the Trans-Jordan section. Paper No. M.E.(O) 248 - Letter from the War Office dated 10th December, 1937 to the Colonial Office covering a War Office report and estimated cost of the proposed road at £515,000 (plus £75,000 Departmental expenses). THE CHAIRMAN said that the project of a Haifa- Baghdad road was referred to by the Ministerial Sub-Committee at their Ninth Meeting on 29th January,1935, when they decided to rule out the 0 f a railway between those places and recorded that the road proposal should do actively pursued.. The hir Minisory originally put forward a proposal to construct a road which, provided it was not used for commercial traffic, would suffice to meet the minimum military requirements in an emergency at an estimated cost of £200,000. The War Office had now, after a detailed survey, submitted a proposal for a road costing nearly £600,000 which would provide for commercial and military traffic, and was recommended in all the circumstances as the most suitable type for construction. Whilst the road would no doubt be of value to commercial traffic, he understood the-2- ft &gt; view to be taken that there was no adequate justification on commercial grounds for the expenditure involved; and that if the project was to be justified, it coula only oe on grounds of strategic necessity. Before the Sub-Committee coula make any recommendation they ought to be clear wnat exactly were the strategical considerations underlying the proposa.1. LIEUT.-C0L0I7EL OSBORI^E said that since their previous discussion the strategical situation in the Mediterranean and Middle East had greatly changed for the worse. Two years ago the strategical aspect of the Eaifa-Baghdad road was the possibility it provided of moving troops from ' est to East in order to deal, if required, witn internal security conditions in Iraq., either in support of tne Air i'Orce units or otherwise; or to implement our Treaty obligations with Iraq.. Recently, however, the Chiefs of otaff h-.d reviewed the situation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East and it had become clear that in certain circumstances difficulties would be encountered in sending reinforcements by sea to Egypt and Palestine# The War Office&gt; tnerefore, were most anxious to have an alternative rouoe for x^einfor— cing Egyot from India, which would be provided by tne Haifa— Baghdad road. This was a new and important development and the War Office desired to urge most strongly the construction of this road as soon as possible# If a final decision could not be reached within the next- two or tnree weeks the completion of the work would be delayed for about a year. It was unfortunate that the War Office survey resulted in the estimated cost Oi tne road being moie-3 than doubled. If it were practicable to prevent all civil or commercial traffic from usin.p a road constructed to the Air • inistry specification, the latter could be accepted as just meeting essential military requirements, but it would be impossible to do this and, in that case, the 'ar Office view was that a road on the Air Ministry basis would break down. Tim CIjAIRMAI! said that he thought the Sub -Com*ni 11 e e generally would accept the principle that, if a road were to be constructed at all, it should be one capable of carrying commercial traffic. fiR. KALI) observed that, since it was probably impracticable to keep commercial traffic off the road, it must be built to a specification to provide for that traffic if it was to remain fit for military use in the emergency. GHOUP-CAPTAII'T ST EVENS 017 said, in reply to a question, that under our Treaty obligations we were obliged to come to the assistance of Iraq in the event of aggression upon her by some other country. So far as internal security is concerned, our Ambassador would no doubt be consulted by the Iraqi Government, and if it were decided to send assistance, troops might have to be moved across the desert. There was also the question of moving troops in support of British units already in the country if our interests were seriously tnreatened. It was impossible to lay down in advance our precise requirements in these respects.THE CHAIRMAN said that in present circumstances he would he reluctant to take too generous a view of our obliga tions towards Iraq. We must of course be ready to honour specific Treaty obligations; but apart from that, and from what our own interests might require, he saw no grounds for showing special consideration towards a country which, owing as it did its very existence to Great Britain, had indulged in open hostility to us over the Palestine question, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS observed that the maintenance of our position in Iraq was to our own interest, and we ought to be in a position to take such steps as might be necessary for this purpose. GROUP-CAPTAIN STEVENSON said that since the Air Ministry estimate for a road to meet the purely military commitment of reinforcing Iraq was prepared some two years ago, there had been a very considerable development in trans-desert commercial motor traffic, both for tourists and goods, which represented a new factor. Moreover, the Air Ministry had discovered that in certain sections of the road the foundations were not as good as was thought. This was particularly so on the portion between Jisr-el-Mejami and El Hosn, Allowing for extra expenditure to put this right, offset by the saving that would occur if the Iraqi Government met the cost of the pro jected road to the Trans—Jordan frontier, the total estimated cost of a road on the Air Ministry basis, allowing of the movement of military reinforcements from West to East, would be in the region of £231,000. He thought a road to the Army specifications would undoubtedly attract a lot of civilian traffic. Whether the Air Ministry road would do so was uncertain, but, if it did, there was little doubt that the road would break down. To sum up, the Air Ministry thought that purely for military requirements in Iraq asatisfactory road could t&gt;e constructed at a cost of litcle more than the Air Ministry estimate of £210,000. If for commercial reasons civilian traffic uses the road to a large extent or is encouraged to use the road 'between Haifa and Baghdad, then it was agreed in principle that the type of road envisaged 'by the War Office was required to meet 'both military and commercial needs. THE CHAIRMAN said that the new strategic considerations adduced 'by the War Office were clearly associated with major problems of the security of the Empire. For that reason it seemed to him that the whole question would have to 'be con sidered in relation to other items in the general defence programme, MR. HALE said that when the scheme was under considera tion in July 1936, the Treasury were doubtful whether the ex penditure could be justified. It was not justified on grounds of commercial traffic. The only strong ground for the road was that it provided access to the air base at Dhibban. Even so they doubted whether the additional degree of security obtained was sufficient return for an expenditure of £200,000. The Treasury also doubted whether the expenditure should be cnarged to the Defence Votes or to a Civil Vote, but eventually, al though the justification for the road was purely strategic, it was decided to place the expenditure on a Civil Vote, partly because it was considered inappropriate to meet the cost from Defence Votes of a road which would be the property of the Trans-Jordan Government, and partly because it was undesirable to make a public admission that the road was being constructed for strategic reasons. In the meantime, from the Treasury point of view, the position had changed for the worse in two ways. The cost of the road had increased nearly three-fold, which still further increased their doubt as to whether value would be obtained for the expenditure, whilst the budgetary position had become extremely difficult.-6- f The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence had recently completed an Interim Report for the Cabinet on the subject of the cost of the defence programmes over the next few years. The basis of the Cabinet’s decisions was the acceptance, in principle, of a definite limit to defence expenditure. The present figure for the quinquennium 193'7-41 was £1,500 million. In consequence, some system of priority had to be established and an order of priority had been allotted by the Cabinet to the following categories of expenditure. First, expenditare on the protection of this country against attack, including protection of the trade routes; secondly, the uefence of British territories overseas, and thirdly on co-operation in the defence of territories of allies. He thought the present project came somewhere between the last two categories, and it was doubtful whether any money would be available for an item in the last category. In view of these considerations, the Treasury felt that the scheme could not be agreed Departmentally without reference to the Ministerial Sub-Committee. CAPTAIN PHILLIPS said that the Admiralty were impressed with the strategical necessity for this road, and with the change in conditions since the 1936 discussions. Under present conditions, with the possibility of hostilities in the Mediterranean, the question of alternative ways of moving reinforcements from East to Vest and into Egypt was of great importance. He thought it might oe advisable for the Sub-Committee to ask the Chiefs of Staff, who had recently had the Mediterranean position unaer review, for a definite opinion which, with the views of the Sub-Committee, could be put before the Ministerial Sub-Committee.MR. HALE said that he was in favour of asking the Chiefs of Staff to report on the degree of priority to he attached to the scheme. LIEUTEITA2TT COLONEL OSBORNE, said that as regards priority he thought the project should cone fairly high, since it was related to the defence of the Suez Canal, and therefore to the protection of a trade route. Although it would not he easy to undertake operations in Egypt hased on connunications across the desert to Baghdad, it would at least provide a channel for bringing in men and material. Proceeding, he pointed out that the Iraqi Government had heen pressed to construct a good road from Baghdad to the frontier and that they had agreed to do so. He thought this carried with it an implication that we were ready to continue the road through Transjordania. MR. BAGGALLAY said that improvements to three sections of the road in Iraq were concerned. The Iraqi Government had agreed to deal with one section hut we did not yet know what they would agree to do in regard to the other two. The expenditure involved was not very large for the Iraqi Governraent hut all the same he thought that they would he surprised if we took no steps to improve the road on our side of the frontier. LIEUTENANT COLONEL OSBORNE, in reply to a question from Mr. Downie as to whether Prance being friendly, use could not he made of the Damascus route, said that a final answer could not he given v/ithout detailed investigation. It was a longer route. There was, moreover, no proper road across the desert on that route which was mainly used by a special type of transport designed for trans-desert work and driven by highly skilled personnel. If the Army ever wanted to move(3 troops quickly from East to West they would have to requisition transport in Iraq. Only ordinary types of transport would he available and these would he unsuitable for the Damascus route. Moreover, that route would not be suitable for movements from West to East. ER. BAGGALLAY said that in the view of the Foreign Office the question of the road had recently become a much more practical issue. Two years ago the question might have seemed rather academic. At the present day, the fact had to be faced that the circumstances in which the road would be needed might really come to pass. In saying this he had not primarily in mind either the major strategical aspect (i.e. East-West reinforcements) or the necessity of assisting Iraq (i.e. the Treaty of Alliance). Leaving aside the question of the moral claims of Iraq upon our goodwill, there was no particular reason to fear that anyone was going to attack her. The Foreign Office were more concerned about the position of the Royal Air Force. The population of Iraq was not actively hostile, but it was unreliable, and circumstances might well arise, particularly as the result of outside influences, leading to a situation dangerous for the base at Dhibban v/hich the Iraqi Government might be unable to control even if it had the will to do so. Vast sums had been spent on this hostage to fortune, and so long as it v/as necessary to have it at all it seemed essential to take whatever measures v/ere necessary to ensure that it could be protected at need. But whether a road was essential for this purpose, and if so, what kind of a road, was a technical question upon which the Foreign Office could not express an opinion.MAJOR BRIGGS (who carried out the War Office survey) said he felt bound to adhere to the view that an expen diture of some half million pounds on the road was the minimum which could provide anything of practical use. He could not agree that even a slightly improved Air Ministry specification would be acceptable. Even in that case single vehicles., in the section between 'H.4 U and the frontier., would be likely to be held up for three days after rain ? whilst convoys would be held up for a week or more. The extra cost involved in providing for commercial traffic did not represent money thrown away. Increased civilian traffic would certainly follow and would bring in some revenue. The route would be shorter than the Damascus route and it was possible that the Nairn transport services would transfer to it. LIEUTENANT COLONEL OSBORNE suggested that the road must be of considerable potential commercial and poli tical value 9 as in 1935 the Palestine Corporation offered to construct it v/ith their own capital* pro vided His Majesty's Government gave certain guarantees. MR. HALE said he thought that the commercial value of the road would not be likely to exceed the maintenance cost 5 apart altogether from the question of interest on the capital outlay-10- « C 01!

After some further discussion, the SUB-COhlllTTES agreed: To ask the Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence, to invite the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee to consider the strategical aspec ts of a road he tween HAIFA and BAGHDAD, to report on the degree of priority to he assigned to such a project in relation to the defence programmes generally, and, if the construction of such a road is recommended, to report on the type of road required. 2, Wh i t e ha 11 Gar dens, S.V7.1., 6tli January, 1938.V Til IS DOCUlvIENT IS TIIE PROPERTY OP HIS BRIT AM IC I‘IAJESTY f S GOVERNI'IENT), S E R E T . jf \ COMMITTEE OF Il-IPERIAL DEFENCE .

J..r Council to refer to the Conclusions of the 47th Meeting of the Standing Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence for questions concerning the Middle Last, and to forward herewith, for the information of Mr. Secretary Orrnsby Gore, an enclosure containing details of the Air Council’s proposals for the construction of a road between Haifa and Baghdad, at a cost of £210,000. The proposals envisage the construction of a road to meet military requirements in the event of an emergency, and are not intended to meet the needs of tourist or commercial traffic which may follow as a result of the construction of the road. 2, The estimate of cost and the details of construction proposed have received the concurrence of the THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE, COLONIAL OFFICE, -i- WHITEHALL, S.W. 1.War Office. They have also been referred to the Cror/n Agents for the Colonies and I am to invite the attention of Mr. Secretary Ormsby Gore to the enclosed copy of a letter from Hr. J.W e Spiller of the Cro-vn Agents for the Colonies in vmich the considerable difference between the estimate of the Air Council and that of the Public Works Department is commented upon. This difference is probably due, in the opinion of the Air Council, to the fact that for reasons of economy their proposals envisage using the alignment of the existing road and track in the lava belt, r/hile those of the Public Works Department are based upon the construction of a road probably much in excess of purely military requirements, with easy gradients and curves, which would necessitate considerable re-alignment in the lava belt section. The Council have given careful consideration to the representa tions put forward in Hr. Spiller's letter. They are satisfied, however, that the standard of road which it is proposed to construct at a cost of £210,000 would adequately meet military requirements and they are unable to justify on military grounds the construction of a higher class oi road with consequent increase in cost. In accordance with the conclusions of tne Committee referred to in the preceding paragraph the question of the incidence of the cost of the proposed road falls to your Department to discuss with one Treasury, and in this connection I am to re±er to the semi-official correspondence which took place in 1934 under Colonial Office number 38191/34. Ine Council ila&lt;3 - 'been of the opinion that as they are responsible for the estimates of cost, and in order to avoid delay, the construction of the road should becarried out under Air :iinistry arrangements and supervision v/hile maintaining close co-operation with the local Public Works Department. In view, however, of the recent transference of all Works Services in Palestine to the Army they feel that the construction of the road would probably now more appropriately be undertaken by the War Office. They understand that the Army Council concur in this proposal. As regards the maintenance of the road, they note that this question was not discussed by the Middle East Sub-Committee, and they consider that arrangements for its maintenance should form txie subject of a recommendation by that Committee. It will be observed that the estimated cost of maintenance under normal weather conditions is £25,000 annua.ll.y. 4.

The only certain knowledge which we possess is the actual cost of the I*P®C* road which amounted to £800 per mile® This was constructed through the lava country where suitable material could be picked up alongside the road 9 and it is clear that the cost of construction outside the lava belt area is likely to be higher on account of the extra ;.ost of collecting material for metalling® There is 9 in additions the cost of the surface treatemnt with bitumen® Mro Ghorayeb estimated that the cost of constructing a water bound macadam road from Mafraq to the commencement of the I.PoC® road would amount to £1 9 645 per miles whereas the Air Ministry estimate that the cost should not exceed JOLONEL JcF® TURiSfER? D®S®0c£1 9 200 per mile including bitumastic treatment. In the Air Ministry’s estimate only £740 per mile is allowed for hottomingg formation and macadam in new constructions whereas Mr. Ghorayeb provides £1 9 645 per mile for his water hound macadam roads and I find it impossible to reconcile these two figures# The quantities are approximately the same 9 and are in fact rather less in Mr. Ghorayeb’s estimate than in the Air Ministry’s esti'.nate 9 so that the difference must be entirely due to the rates at which it is anticipated the work can be carried out# We have always regarded Mr# Ghorayeb’s estimate as on the high side 9 and doubtless he provided for a road of first class finish, whereas the Air Ministry’s estimate is intended to provide, at the lowest possible cost, a road which can carry a certain amount of motor traffic all through the year# I think £210,000 should suffice to provide an all- weather road, but I am not satisfied that when the formation and bottoming has been completed the funds remaining will suffice for an expenditure of £460 a mile on bitumastic treatment as contemplated by the Air Ministry# Is it possible to get a firm tender from the Shell Co#, Egypt, for the construction of the whole or a portion of the road?

Practically the wholo of this section is suitable for use in all weathers by mechanical transport, and alternative tracks are available in the event of one cutting up. West of Ramadi a length of 5 miles of road is partly soft clay and partly rough ground with gypsum out-crops. Here it is proposed to provide a gravel, sand and bitumen carpet, raising the road where the possibility of flooding would otherwise occur. About one mile east of Rutbah the track is rocky and rough for a length of about half a mile and is crossed by three small Wadis. Stone is available and it is proposed to provide a 6 ” bitumen grouted road on this length. It will be necessary to bridge the Wadi Hauran referred to in the previous paragraph, in vi&lt;?w of the anticipated depth of water when the Wadi is in flood. Details of the proposals and estimated cost are given in tabulated form at Appendix ’’A'. The estimates are based upon normal rates of wages. It is possible that the labour question will • be complicated by complying with any requirements the Transjordan Government may lay down in regard to the employment of Transjordan labour. In this connection it is possible that the Transjordan Government may wish to recruit all the labour£875 required, other than supervisory grad.es, from specific Trihes and to change the actual personnel from time to time to meet local conditionse It would appear that skilled labour for bridge work, etc., would have to be drawn from other than Transjordan sources.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your confidential despatch ’B’ of the 14th of December, 1935, on the subject of the improvement of road communication between Haifa and Baghdad. 2. This question has received further consideration in consultation with the other Departments concerned and in the light of the information furnished in your despatch-. In accordance with the conclusions reached, the Air Ministry have now prepared estimates of the cost of constructing a road primarily for military purposes, and I enclose a copy of a letter from that Department of the 12th of November (with its enclosures)® It will be seen that the Air Ministry estimate that a road to meet military requirements can be constructed at a cost of approximately £ 200,000 so far as the Trans-Jordan sector is concerned. The remaining sum is in respect of the Iraqi sector and will fall to be met by the Iraqi Government. - 1 --2- 3o I recognise that the construction of a road designed to meet military requirements is not an ideal solution, hut I am of opinion that the hest course is to proceed with the construction of a road based on the Air Ministry estimates as a first stage, and the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are being asked whether they are prepared to agree to the provision in the United Kingdom Estimates of a sum of £200,000 as a special grant to Trans-Jordan. I shall be obliged if you will inform me as soon as possible by telegram whether you are prepared to agree to the construction of a road as proposed by the Air Ministry, and whether you agree that the supervision of the construction of the road should be undertaken, as suggested in the Air Ministry letter, by the Army authorities. 4o It will be seen that the estimated cost of maintaining the road when constructed is £25,000 annually. It will have to be decided in due course how this money is to be found# The question is not one which needs urgent decision, but I request that I may be favoured with your views in due course both as to the estimate of £25,000 and as to the source from which the cost should be met.

Your despatch secret of the 26th November. Haifa Baghdad road. In view of the urgency of this project I agree that as a first stage the best course is to proceed with the construction of a road based on Air Ministry estimates. My advisers however do not agree that the provision is adequate and I must emphasise that should this prove to be the case Palestine cannot afford to meet the additional cost; nor can Palestine afford to meet the cost of maintenance. I also agree that the Army authorities should undertake the supervision of the construction of the road. The military character of supervision should be minimised as much as possible: and close co-operation should be maintained between the Army authorities and the British Resident who I trust will be consulted with regard to the labour to be employed. Not only will these arrangements benefit the people of Trans-Jordan but the public security also. I assume that alignment of the road will be on ! land leased to Iraq Petroleum Company adjacent to pipeline. If so, I suggest that an agreement should be reached with Iraq Petroleum Company in London. i l have consulted the General Officer Commanding who considers that the alignment of the road should be such as to enable a railway to be built later with the greatest possible ease since in his opinion to meet the possibility of having to maintain any considerable force over distance involved a railway would be of military necessity. 3-HI B ZCFLR'-uNCS HO: GF/179/5_5 c _ High Comiiiissioncr for Palestine, JIjRU Si-iLHM, 17th Decemher, 1936« 1 Sir, I have the honour to refer to your Secret despatch of the £ 6 th November, 1936, on the subject of the improve ment of road communication between Haifa and Baghdad, and to my telegraphic reply thereto, ho:933 of the 10th December. 2. In that telegram I mentioned that my advisers do not agree that .he provision proposed in the *ir h inis try estimate will he adequate for the work in view. It is not necessary to enter into details of the estimated costs, but I think it advisable to bring to your notice the two points following. 3. On page 3 of the Air Council’s proposals it is stated, with reference to the section of i-he road which lies between Jisr Hajami and ^1 Hosn, that tn roaa as a macadam road is excellent. This statement appears to be based on a misapprehension of the nature of the repairs which have lately been effected to this road. The work done comprised drainage, earth formation, the construction of a permanent foundation of soling stone and a coating of five centimetres of metal to provide a reasonably smooth running surface until such time as the work can be properly completed. It is not in itself a permanent finished road, and if left in this condition indefinitely the value of the work done would be largely lost. The consolidation of the portions of this section of uhe road which have been so repaired is estimated to cost LP.26,000.-5' There are other parts. totalling 13 kilometres in length, of this section which have not 'been metalled, and which would not, it is thought, stand up to the neavv traffic envisaged in the Air Council’s proposals, as it has already deteriorated badly under normal traffico The cost of making good these parts is estimated to be LP.13,000, The total expenditure estimated to be necessary on this section is thus LP- 39,000, compared with LP.7,000 allotted in the Air Council’s proposals, 4. It is also observed that on page 4 of the proposals it is stated that the estimates are based upon normal rates of wages. The Director of Public Dorks, Trans-Jordan, estimates that on sections D and b it will be necessary to pay wages approximately 80&gt;o above normal rates, 5, I should also inform you that the British Resident advises me that the willing assent of the Trans-Jordan Government to the proposals under considera tion would be given only on the understanding that the road, when constructed, would be available for use by private and commercial motor car traffic, I have, etc,, (Signed) ARTHUR WAUCHOPb, High Commissioner for Palestine and Trans-Jordan, THE RIGHT HONOURABLE YY.G.A.

Sir, I am commanded by the Army Council to refer to Conclusion (c) of the Forty-seventh Meeting of the Standing Official Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence for Questions concerning the Middle East, held on 2nd July, 1936, dealing with the Baghdad Haifa road, and to submit herewith a report on the detailed programme and estimate referred to therein. 2 . I am to make the following observations for the information of Mr. Secretary Ormsby-Gore. 3. This new War Office estimate differs very considerably in many respects from the earlier one made by the Air Ministry. The cost is £515,000 (plus £75,000 for departmental expenses) as against £210,000. The War Office road will take present heavy civilian traffic, whereas the Air Ministry road only caters for purely military needs in an emergency. COPY NO■2- 4. As stated in Air Ministry letter Sc31956/II/S.6, dated 12th Novernber, 1936, paragraph 1 ? the nir Ministry road is M Not intended -go meet the needs of tourist or commercial traffic which may follow as a result of the construction of the road'o From page 4, paragraph 4, of the enclosed report, it is obvious that this traffic has already developed since the first estimate was made* To prohibit the use of the new road by ivilian vehicles is not feasible; but ? in the opinion of the Council, to ignore the existence of this traffic would result in the break up of the Air Mi: istry road in a very short period, rendering it useless from the strategical point of view, unless repairs were continually being carried out&lt;, 5. It would appear, therefore, that the choice is between 1 (a) '.Var Office road, with high capital cost, but normal maintenance, and capable of taking present civilian traffic, or (b) A ip. .Mi nistry road, with low capital expenditure, but very heavy maintenance costs which would be a serious permanent dr.,in upon the financial resources of Trans-Jordan, and could not be guaranteed to be in a fit state for strategical use at all timeso In the long run the expenditure involved might even exceed that under (a ) 0 J 6 . The Council feel that we must plan for the future, and they would point out that it is only the recent detailed and very thorough re conn a j stance which has placed the -problem-3- @ in its proper perspective. They consider, therefore, that the question should he looked at from the wider aspect ^ on general grounds and that the Vjar Office plan should he accepted, although they fully realize the financial difficulties involved hy the incre .sed capital expenditure incurred under the new estimate. 7 . I am to add that, from the constructional point of i view, the hest results will he obtained if all the necessary staff from this country are in Palestine hy April. The Council request therefore that they may he given definite instruction to proceed with the work before 15th January, 1933, at latest. 8 .

Briggs, D.S.0.,M.C.,R.E., were to check on Air Ministry estimate of £ 200,000 and satisfy himself that the work stated therein could be covered from the sum estimatedo The Air Ministry estimate was for:- (a) A road which will be passable throughout its length in good weather, and on which the minimum of delay will be caused in wet weather. (b) An initial advance estimated at 4-50 vehicles with subsequent traffic at 4-0 lorries a day, with a maximum load of 3 tons per lorry.

In order to check these costs, careful enquiry of local costs of labour, material and transport have been made, and an approximate estimate of quantities in formation has been carried out. Detailed estimates of cost of soling and surfacing have been made. These estimates are appended to this Report. It will be seen that the cost of work in R.A.F. estimate and the present estimate, compare as shown below:-.9- New Work /r’t) Se ct! cm o BsJ-izJL 0 El Husn ~ o o o £2,260 per .n±le 0 M?.l‘raq - Lavao«. • • «o Rurfaciii;-; exi sv in-; trap k.

The cost of surfacing the jhP,C, track tnrough the lava presents a great divergence in costs. The Air Ministry have, it appears, based their cost of surfacing on a trial stretch of bitumised surface at H.5. Here crushed metal was lolled on top of the lava boulders comprising the soling and grouted with bitumen. Owing to the unevenness of the soling and the varying depth of metal the roller could not affect even compaction. The metal continued to compact unaer traffic in the low places, and now the surface is a series of w and waves, .0 „»cl&gt; p „Uo» of the lava toad, one has to elo. down to non over this trial bitumonised length.

Regular goods traffic between BAGHDAD and the Mediterranean already use this road to a considerable extent. As regards (2)„ A road that is so rough that speeds of over 20 mcp.ho cannot be maintained, would soon break down under the impact of heavy vehicles passing over the bumps unless a first class foundation and surface was given. If such were given on a badly graded road, it would be very false economy. In the following proposals therefore, a road has been designed for fast speed in the plain section,and speeds of 30 m«poh. in the hill section and lava district. Bridges and culverts and the road except for the desert section, between the end of the lava and the Iraq Frontier, are designed to carry all military heavy loads. The desert section, having no soling, is limited to the loads and conditions specified in paragraph 5, Section E, of this report.

The specification to be adopted was the addition of 4 cms« of metal to the present surface making a total thickness of 10 cms., and to give a double surface dressing of 5 kgs* of bitumen per M2 for the two coats© As the Transjordan Government have a roads organisation and well-trained staff for this work, and were already collecting metal on site, and as I had noted the good class of road construction being carried out by their executive engineer on this and other roads, I therefore approached the British Resident, Transjordan on the subject of the work being carried out by them. The British Resident stated that he was prepared to recommend that the Transjordan Government carry out the work under a special allotment as a cost to the HAIFA-BAGHDAD road project© The road is to be widened as stated in the Estimate appended, to be soled 5 metres wide throughout, fully culverted and drained.

D* macadam road has been continued from Irbid to Husn, and here it terminates, after which one branch of earth track leads along the pipe line to Llafraq. and one goes South to Jerash and Amman* As stated in paragraph 2, the present pipe line track is unsuitable as a road. A good road location was found from Irbid over a plain to where it Joins the Mafra.q. - Ramtha-12- track, near El -Bowelda; it then follows this track to Mafraq. There are 9 kms. of hill section between El Boweida and Mafraq. without any severe grades or extensive rock cuttings* An air photo of this area has been specially taken by the R* A* E« The plain section of 37 kins* runs for about 16 kms* through agricultural land, and the cost of purchase will be about £1,600 for a strip 20 metres wide* It is proposed to grade up the formation in the plain section i metre high with graders. The whole road to be soled throughout, and have a 6 cm* surface of chippings, premixed with bitumen, and a sealing coat of bitumen blinded with chippings. Section H D H * Mafraq -J-I4* Consists of 24 kms* of desert section and 174 kms. of lava country with a soled, but unmetalled road. This desert section requires soling laid on top of the desert surface, and the 6 cm. premix surface as in Section M C”. In the lava road section, it appeared at first questionable whether it would not be better value to choose a new alignment. It was found however, that this would cost more money, and it is considered that the present soling has considerable solvage value in that it has ceased its settlement.- 13 - About 25^o of this soling* however* will have to be lifted for regrading, including several minor re-alignments and one major re-alignment of 11 kms.* found necessary to avoid several severe grades. The irregularities in the manner in which the soling was laid or has since settled* prevents the use of a thin 6 cm. surface* as in the last sector* and it is considered that 10 cms. of premixed metal will be a minimum necessity to eliminate the inequalities in the soling. It will be necessary to lay this in two courses to prevent unequal consolidation by the roller. The first course of 6 cms. to eliminate the worst inequalities followed by a top course of 4 cms. thickness. No seal course will be necessary on this for 2 years* and this will be done as maintenance. The 14 kms. of desert West of H4 will be treated in the manner of the desert as described under Section 'E' below. Section 'E ” H4 to Iraq Frontier . This section consists of 76 kms. of clay with a surface sprinkling of small stone varying from gravel to 2 -in. mostly flint* and of little use. It is proposed to grade up this to a formation ^-metre high omitting soling. The formation to stand for the winter’s rains of 1938/39. The surface will then be bladed, after which 3 cms. of metal will be spread* and spraying and light rolled. Metal of an 8 cm. surface will be laid in windrows or the road sprayed with bitumen* then mixed and spread by grader. Soling has been omitted owing to the high cost of labour and difficulty in obtaining soling stone in the desert.A bitumen carpet on a clay formation has been used with success in Iraq . 9 and at the R.A.F. Camp at Dhibban. It has stood all constructional transport in the camp with out any noticeable effect on the road 3 This type of road is extensively used in U.S.A.j and there the State laws lay down the following limitations as to tyre sizes and loads 600 lbs, per inch of tyre width. 16 s 000 ” on one axle. 24- 5 000 on 4 wheeled vehicles. 32 9 000 ” on 6 wheeled vehicles. 38 9 000 ' on service trailer. 6 . Drainage, Pro s sings and Culve r t_s. The wet season is approximately from November to April inclusive 9 and the maximum rainfall West of Mafraq is about 14 inches. East of Mafraq is as little as 5 inches. East of Mafraq where the desert begins* the rain fall is slight and generally local* and there is little information as to its effect on the wadis. These are mostly affected by local storms; some wadis may come down in spate once in a few years when they are in the path of a local cloud-burst. Certain wadis which have a large catchment area will flood once or more each year* but as the road is impassable at each end on these occasions no observers in the past have been at these wadis to say the extent of the floodc The following wadis have a large catchment area* and flood each year:- Wadi Aqib..21 kms. East of Mafraq Pole 526/17. Wadi Ragil.,13 kms,. East of H5 Pole 475/9. Wadi Hussein or Amqst..32 kms. Vest of K4 Pole 435, Wadi Raweishid,.10 kms. East of H4 Pole. These wadis may flow at a depth of between 4 to 6 ft. for some hours* after which it is thought that the flow is shallow. As* however* no well-constructed causeways have been buiit* traffic has to wait till the old causeways are rebuilt. It is possible that well constructed causewayswould enable traffic to cross after a delay of perhaps 4 to 12 hours. It is not recommended that bridges be constructed at present 5 except in the case of the Wadi Raweishid, where the waterway is well defined 9 and the banks are well above flood height^ but that substantial causeways be constructed in the first instance^ until more definite information of the action of floods is obtained. To erect bridges without this information;, would lead to either a very much larger bridge being built than necessary, or risk of a smaller bridge being carried av/ay. In all other wadi crossings, there being about 45 in the lava district, it is proposed to construct Irish bridges. On the mud flats, where the flow is very slight, if any, it will only be necessary to provide means of equalizing the height of water lying on each side of the road by a series of short Irish bridges or by culverts. 7. Water Supply . Irbid . Water is available in quantity, and would have to be purchased under contract with the Irbid Municipality. I.P.C. Sources . Subject to an agreement with the I.P.C. it has been ascertained that the I.P.C. may agree to allow us to draw water from their sources on payment of the cost to them of re equipping old wells, erecting water points, pumping costs, and all out-goings. These wells are situated as under. The quan tities shown are the maximum supplies surplus to I.P.C. requirements. H4 .. 12,000 galls, per day not potable. 16 kms. West of H4 .. 3,000 galls, per day. 33 kms. West of H4 .. 5,000 galls, per day, hand pump H5 . . 5,000 galls, per day. Mafraq ..12,000 galls, per day.The above could be secured -without additional equipment. 25 kms. East of H5 .. 9 S 000 galls, per day. No equipment. H5 from Ayrak ..84,000 galls per day. The pipe line from Ayrak to H5 would have to be reconditioned at an approximate cost of £ 200 . It is preferable from I.P.C. point of view that all supplies at H5 should come from Ayrdi, On account of the type of construction recommended water requirements will be kept to a munimum. The labourer requires 4 galls, per day per man. Work falls off and he is dicontented with less than this. The cost of transport of water is estimated at 62 mils, per 1,000 galls, per km.and return. It is recommended that all water points be put in working order, the cost ol installation of plant will be repaid on saving in cartage. 8 . Feeding . The Bedouin, if he buys his own food, is liable to economise at the expense of his strength. If, however, he is provided with rations, he will save his rations and send them to his family or sell them in the nearest village. It is considered that the method of adding the least extra work and worry and accounting difficulties will be to allow a contractor to open a shop in each camp,selling food at agreed prices direct to the labourer Non-Arab personnel will be on a ration allowance, and will make their own arrangements for messing.The Emir of Transjordan will insist that only Transjordan shopkeepers be asked to tender for ration supplies. Cooks and servants will be at the cost of the work. 9• Medical . It will be necessary to provide medical attention at the labour camps both for the attention to cases of sickness accident 9 and for general sanitation. The Transjordan Government have no medical officer or dressers available, but the Director of Medical Services, Trans jordan would be prepared to employ one medical officer and a dresser with equipment in each camp as a charge against the work. The medical officer would have to be provided with a car. The Transjordan Government would then be responsible for the medical treatment and sanitation. 10. Stone . Stone is available on the surface or at no great distance below the surface of the whole length of the proposed road. The points at which it will be possible to find limestone at an economical depth in the desert section are uncertain, and will require trial bores to find these. It is not anticipated however, that any points on the road need be more than 5 kms. from any quarry. The limestone varies from good average to hard flinty limestone. Except in the lava country the stone is limestone. The lava rock is basalt. Prom a trial of a crusher carried out, the output of crushed basalt was about half of the maker’s minimum output for limestone.- 18 - A The limestone is very suitable for masonry in most of the limestone country. The basalt is expensive to dress but makes good masonry work* 11. Bitumen. The Shell Company of Egypt at present hold the contract for the supply of Bitumen to the public Works Department, Palestine and Transjordan, and R.A.F., Baghdad. It appears there is no other Company who can compete with them in price for the supply of any considerable quantity. The present market price for Shell Company's Bitumen per ton in drums is:- Free on boat Suez- £6.350 Cost of Carriage, Sea Freight C.I.F. Haifa. £0.710 C.I.F. Haifa toF. O.R. Haifa. £0.200 F.O.R. Haifa to F.O.R. Mafraq. £1.182 Discharge Mafraq. £0.050 £8.4-92 It is expected that a more favourable rate could be obtained on account of the quantity to be used. The approximate quantity required is 9,700 tons. 12. Labour. Labour in Transjordan is both unskilled and expensive. During the construction of the pipe line, the I.P.C. paid their unskilled labourer 0.180 mils, per day and provided all rations, ready cooked on the work,6&gt; -19- free to the labourers. Here expense was subordinated to creating good will. It is anticipated; however, that East of Mafraq, labour will demand 120 mils, ‘per day and 40 mils, for rations, a total of 160 mils, per day. The provision of tentage and water will bring the cost per man up to 180 mils, per day. In the Irbid Sector labour should not exceed 100 mils, per day. The exceptionally good harvests of this year will tend to Iceep wages up . The Transjordan Government v/ill insist on Trans jordan labour being employed in all cases where it is obtainable; both skilled and unskilled imported labour will necessarily have to be Arab. 15. Transport. It is proposed to purchase suen transport as can be mainly depreciated on the v/ork, i.e., that which can be fully employed throughout the period of construction. These vehicles comprise - Staff cars, Water lorries, Vehicles for transport of bitumen, petrol and other fuel. A proportion of the vehicles used for the transport of stone. The balance of vehicles can be hired in Transjordan on daily rates. It is estimated that the daily hire of one three-ton lorry and driver will be about £4. Petrol should be supplied by the W.D., so as to avoid Customs duty. It is proposed to sell petrol to the contractor at local retail prices and credit the profit to the work. This will prevent the sale of duty-free petrol by the contractor op his driver.- 20 - 14. Hire of Haciiiner.v, Graders and. Heavy Tra cAor_s_^ Messrs. Ilurdoch. and Broolis of Baghdad nave the following machines available, and are prepared either to tender for word or to hire their machinery and snilled operators 'by the day. The estimated cost of the earth formation in all Sections, except the 9 Ions, of hill country West of Mafraq and the lava country, is based on the use of tractors and graders. 4 R D 7 Caterpillar Tractors, 2 No. 42 Elevating Graders, 2 No. 66 Blade Graders, 1 Le Tourneau heavy rooter with power control, 2 Killifer Scrapers (3 yard). The cost of purchase of this machinery for the worlc would be high, and the efficiency of the operators available would be doubtful. It is recommended there fore, that this firm tahe on the word at an agreed price. No other machinery is available for this type of word in Iraq or Palestine.. This team of machines would finish the plain and desert sections in about three months. After which it is proposed that the 4 R D 7 Tractors should be distributed amongst the sections and hired on a daily basis for word in cuttings augmented by angle-danger heads and rooters which should be either purchased or hired to Government by the contractor, or purchased by the Government and used in conjunction with the hired tractors. Light Tracto rs, J3cpapers and Roo ters. These are available in Palestine, and could be hired and would be great labour-savers in short carries in'' * ^ &amp; cut and fill work. Light tractors will also be required with sheep foot rollers for consolidation of earth forraation. The sheep foot rollers could be manufactured locally. 15. Payment of Labour. The payment of 1,500 men and local hired transport etc., will be a job in itself, and I strongly recommend that this wora. be taizen off the Lands of the Executive Engineers. Besides payment, taking up much of the engineer* s time when he could be employed more economically at his profession. With Civil Engineers it would be advisable to have payments made by a commissioned officer. I recommend the appointment of a ’'Field Cashier” who would pay all labour and local transport cnce in two weeks. The actual payment would take him about one week out on the road, and the second week he would need for book-keeping at Headquarters. It would still be necessary for the three Executive Engineers, and the O.C. Base, to be imprest holders in order to pay off labour and transport, and make urgent local purcnases within their powers. 16. Organisation of Work. (1) Headeuarters, H aifa. ( 2 ) (3) It is considered that the Headquarters should oe at Haifa for the following reasons. * Efficient clerks are difficult to obtain in Transjordan, while in Palestine efficient Jewish clerks are easily obtained. At Mafraq, which is the only alternative, accommodation would have to be built, and it diffic ult to obtain even Arab clerical staff for employment in the desert.-22- L&lt;o (5) ( 6 ) (V) ( 8 ) Tlie I.P.C. have their F.eadr-uarters at Haifa, and close liaison will be necessary with this Ooujpany they can be very useful to us if their fjood will is obtained. Cash for payment will have to be drawn from Haifa. The distance from Haifa to Mafran can can be covered by car in under 4 hours. Most local purchase of materials will have to be made in Haifa, and Haifa is the port for supply from England. Railhead and ■advanced Base, Mafraq._ The advanced base will be under the charge of a salaried official, and will be organised as below:- 0. C. Base and Recruiter and Transport Officer. 1 Clerh Head Storeheener. Assistant Recruiter and Transport Supt. 20 Labourers. 1 Clerh. Mechanist Workshops 3 Fitters 3 Labourers 2 Clerics. Transport P. 0. L. This base will have to be inside a wire cage : hutting being provided for the staff and labour, also a transit quarter for inspecting officers. All lorries for the distribution of Bitumen, petrol. Oil, Lubricants and Stores will be based on Mafraq. The Recruiter will engage shilled and other labour from Amman and villages, said arrange for hired transport and distribute this and other transport.(9) Road Work . The road V/ork is to be divided into three sections, each under an engineer The further sub-division of each sector is given in Table 24, Appendix III. Each engineer is responsible to the O.C. Road for-the detailed survey and fitting out of his trace on the ground, and plans for the engagement of such labour as will complete his sector to the specification given him, and in the time allowed. As far as possible, task work will be given. 16.A. Staff Available locally . It is anticipated that Civilians could be obtained locally for all posts except a C.R.E,and the three engineers in charge of road work. The Shell Company may have two qualified Engineers available for road work who have had varied road experience in the Near East. This would naturally be dependent on this Company obtaining the Bitumen Contract. It would be essential to have some military stores and accounts personnel to work the military system. (See Table 23.

I consider it desirable that a fixed tele phone system be installedj and it could use the I.P.C. telegraph 'poles. Sections could then hook in anywhere on the road.. (ii) Between Mafraq and Haifa there is a civil telegraph and telephone connection which is slow. In addition to the -ivil postal service ? the I.P.C. have a letter service between their stations and Haifa every other day. (iii) Rail Communication .

Personal* The Office of The Rt.Hon D.Lloyd George, O.M., M.P. • / / \ V o '-U Thames House, Millbank, London, S.W.l. 2nd October, 1936. Dear Hoyer Millar, I should be extremely obliged to you if you could help me in the following matter. I understand that an English engineer in Istanbul and Angora, who is said to be on very good terms with the British Ambassador in Turkey, and also Lord Stanhope, has formed a group of business men for the installation of blast furnaces in Turkey. It is estimated that these will cost something like £3 millions. It is also said that he has the support of Banks, including the Midland Bank. This engineer is reported to be a member of a group of English engineers which is surveying the possibility of the laying down of a railway connecting Palestine, Irak, and Persia, with India. This is such a huge undertaking that the Foreign Office might know something about it. If not, would it be possible for you diplomatically to find out from the Ambassador in Turkey if this is true. The reason I ask is because certain people here are trying to raise capital on the strength of it. I merely want to know if it is sound. Yours sincerely, (Signed) A.J.Sylvester.

There ia at present no intention of building a railway between Bagdad and Haifa and it is likely to be a long tirae before the Persian Oovernment are ready to embark on railways other than the north to south Trans-Persian railway on which they are already engaged and which is absorbing all their energies. They have however talked in the past of building branch railways to Bagdad and the Indian frontier and it is Just possible that groups of foreign financiers may be trying to interest them in such schemes. building a railway connecting Turkey with Tehran by way of Tabriz* but all such schemes, though the governments of the countries concerned may possibly be thinking about them in a general way, are at present quite nebulous. There has also been some talk of a scheme forM THB SUB-CO?;:MITTSr: had under consideration certain oarers dealing viti; the Baghdad-Hr if a road ^ which had been circulated v/ith Facer ITo. I oE.(0.) 209* Mr, Guia ble; v rt s -&gt;ro-^osal to use the 15 ton unit as an a lternative t o constructixCg a ro ad„ THE CTAIRMAH explained that this ^rooosal was set out in Letter No. C.Th/330/35 dated loth February ? 1935, froia hr. Hall to hr. Williams. The acceptance of the proposal to use the 15-ton unit instead of constructing a road 5 was 'orimarily a matter for the War Office and Air hinistry. COLOI'TE.l- ADAJ.’I said that the ; ar Office did not favour this uro :osal for the followin'' reasons:- (i) The cross country capacity of these motor vehicles, v/hich i t was understood equailed that of a £-wheeler, was not satisfactory. (ii) In the event of an initial advance of a British Force through this area , a road was absolutely necessary. The force had 700 vehicles which must move on their own wheels and the 15-ton units could not assist in moving them. (iii) The 15-ton unit might be valuable in laying down oetrol dumus for the force for large scale maintenance but it would be most un economical to use this transport ior main taining the small garrisons scattered in losts to guard the route. TING- COj u-ANDEF PIRIS said that the Air Ministry entirely agreed with this view. They felt it might be useful as an auxili ry but that it would never take the ''lace of a road. THE SUB-CO! ITTrF agreed that it was unnecessary to pursue Hr. Gumbley’s &gt;ro:ocal further. 1-Should the const ruetion of ' a rood h e en trusted to 'the Palest ine Cor &gt;orot ion i- iinihfid 9 TFh C-A.I11 /l-f roi'.ed the Question whether as ”, rood was considered necessary 3 its construction should be entrusted to the Palestine Corporation v/nich u.ad out in proposals or whether the v/orh should be undertahen oy Government. Ke releri'ed to a Colonial Office des fitch to the High Commissioner 5 dated 31st November, 1935 9 and the latter’s reply thereto dated 6th February, 1936, from which it was apo-arent that there were various possible objections to accepting the Palestine Corporation s proposalo MR. BRIDGES said that from the Treasury point of view it wos cuite out of the Question to entrust this work to the Palestine Corporation. If an acceptable body was prepared to put up the necessary money, the problem would be quite different. THE SUB-COKLIITTEE agreed that the oronosals sub mitted by the Palestine Corporation Limited for the con struction of a road from Baghdad to Koifa, should not be accepted. Consideration of Proposals to construct the Road . COLONEL ADAH said the Bar Office had considered five proposals for rood construction - (A) to (E) - referred to in the despatch from the High Commissioner No.CF/179/35 of 14th December, 1935. The only suitable scheme was proposal (E) since this was the only 'Ian which dealt ade quately with the road through the lava belt, but the &gt;ar Office considered that all the schemes were unnecessarily high. Details of a road which could be made for £210,000 would be explained by the Air Ministry representative.The Y'&amp;r Office considered the construction of a road to he an urgent u'-ohlem. Ti.e oroaosals had been under con sideration lor the last 13 months and the 'ar Office were of opinion that in the oresent troubled situation in the Ivliddle East it was essential that the road should be started at an early date. WING COM LAID SR PIRIE said that the Air Ministry had carefully considered the various prooosals in consultation with the ar OM ice end v/ere fully in agreement with them that the only suitable scheme was that submitted by the Director of ‘forks and Buildings, Air Ministry. This visualised the construction of a road at a cost of £210^000 which would stand ua in all weathers to the volume of traffic which - it was estimated - would be required to use it in an emergency. CAPTAIf KALLAS said th t he hnd considered official reports on the road from the Chief Engineers in Iraq and the Middle East* together with certain unofficial reports. His considered opinion was that for £210,000 it was possible to build a road which would stand up to all weathers. Briefly the details of the orooosed road were:- (a) an all-weather rood was completed to Jisr Mejamie; (b) from Jisr Me.jamie to El Kosn a water bound macadam road exists to which it would be necessary to provide a waterproof bitumenised cover - cost £7,000; (c) a bitumenised road at a cost of £56,500 including culverts and bridges would be made from El Hosn to Mafraq; (d) from Mafraq to the end of the lava belt, a bitumenised road on the I.PoC. alignment would be made at a cost of £127,000; (e) from the end of the lava belt to the Trans Jordan frontier, 6 miles of road at -3--4- bad saots and a .roaches to wadis would be necessary 9 costing £6 &lt;,000; (f) from the Trans Jordan frontier to Hamadi bridges, wadi crossings and road would be built v/here necessary at a cost of £9,000. TiiE CHAIPH01T remarked that it would also be necessary to consider the cuestion of maintenance. In nrooosal (E) this had been estimated at Oho ,000 s. year. The general oninion of the Sub-Committee was tnat the oronosal for the construction of a road as outlined by Contain Hollas should be accented as it fulfilled both the War Office and Air Hinistry requirements. THE CHAIF1I/JT suggested that the Air Hinistry, in consultation with the ' T ar Off ice, should nrenare for tlie Colonial Office detailed nrogramme and estimates for the construction of the road, which should include nro- oosals for maintenance. These estimates should be cir culated to the interested Departments. This procedure was agreed to, but it was thought desirable that before putting forward the programme etc., the Air Hinistry should consult with Colonel Fleming (Crown Agents for the Colonies). PING COMHAEDER PIRIE again stressed the importance attached by the Air Hinistry and ' 7 ar Office to the con struction of the road and their earnest desire to have the work put in hand vuthout delay. A discussion ensued on the question whether the Service Departments or the Palestine and 'Trans Jordan Governments should be responsible for the construction of the road up to the Trans Jordan-Iraq frontier. It wasgenerally agreed that this v/ork should be entrusted to the Public orks he ■' rtuents in ? ‘destine and Trans Jordan * and it was ointed out th t the work could be sylit uw into sections and carried out locally by labour resident in those sections. As regards the financial implications it was pointed out that the ia in v rt of the cost would be incurred uaon road work in Trans Jordan. MR. 3PIDGE3 said he would deal with the natter on the assumption th^t it w s decided to proceed with the scheme j, although the pro posal before the Committee v/ould cle-rly h've to be submitted to higher authority. The resent proposal v -'as nit forward on strategic grounds ai]d it seemed unlikely that Palestine co T.d be ■■ersuaded to &lt;ay for the cost of the Trans Jordan section. If the Government of Trans Jordan was made financially responsible for the cost --f the road in its territory ? the ex .enditure would in fact fall to be borne by this country via the grant in aid to Trans Jordan. Regarded irom this goint of view^ it was really a question of whether the cost would more appropriately be borne on the Vote for Colonial and Middle Eastern Services* or on the Vo+es of the Service he ^rtments. He asked whether as commercial traf; ic developed 5 it v/ould be possible to extract some payment or toll from the users f the road; heavy tra:fie would involve increased maintenance charges. It was agreed that t is possibility deserved consideration. After further discussion on the financial aspects of the ;ro :osal it \r s agreed th. t r - decision as to the Vote on which the capital cost should be borne could not be taken by the Sub-Committee.1 &lt;§) The nueBtion was raised whether further reference to the Ministerial Middle East Suh-Corsmittee would he neces sary. I'HE r ; T h IP; A, h did not consider that this would be necessary and he suggested that it would meet tne Cc.oe if 9 when the Air Ministry ■•rooosels were received by the Colonial Office s they were submitted to the Treasury officially together with a draft despatch to the High Commissioner for Palestine and Trans Jordan for aa^roval.

One of the questions to be decided was what is the requisite standard e*g. * was a first-class retailed road required. He asked the Service Departments who were closely concerned to state their re quire me n ts * 2, COLOriSL ADAM* who spoke in this respect for the Air Ministry representatives also said that what the military authorities required was a road along which they could send reinforcements from Palestine to Iraq in all weathers. The x 4 oad should, be a hie to carry about 40 lorries a day with maximum load of &gt; tons per lorry (54 ton axle load). In addition a force including rome 450 vehicles of the same average weight would move over the road during the initial advance of reinforcements* At present they could only do this over parts of the route in dry ?/eather. In order to make the road passable in all weathers their requirements were as follows in order of priority:- (a) An adequate surface along the whole road through the lava belt* The present road was composed of a bed of broken lava stones covered with a layer of powdered lava which was easily dispersed. There was one stretch of about a nile in length at the Iraq Petroleum Company's pumping station Ho5 0 where a surface had been laid down by adding a bitumen skin using small chippings and fines, although a seal coat of bitumen was needed, this stretch had proved adequate in all weathers, ^n estimate lor the whole lava road had been given as £60*000, (b) An all-weather road from liamakh to Mefrak* Last year this road had been adequate in fair ’Gather onlytout it was understood that iinproveiaents were now oeing carried out. (c) The 'crossings' along the desert portions of the road (i*e. from the eastern edge of the lava toelt. to Rama&amp;i) should toe made fit for use in all weathers. They are few in number* At present these peaces are unfit for use after heavy rain, and heavy traffic tends to cut them up and so make the going' difficult. (d) Improvement of the 2-k mile stretch immediately west of Ramadi which was unfit for use after heavy rain. GQLUNiL FLEMING- said that it would probably be better at present not to narrow the track across the desert, which is probably from 1GO—200 yards wide, hut to concentrate on providing an adequate surface for the crossings. 4» It was explained that the Haifa—Saaakh section of the route needed no improvement, tout the suggestion was made that a more direct route might toe found from Jisr MaJamie to Haifa, in which case the total distance would toe no longer than the Syrian routes. 5. SIR G. PARKINSON referred to the question of cost. Nothing approaching a reliable estimate was available in the Colonial Office although figures had been quoted in respect of certain sections. For instance the cost of surfacing the existing soling of the road through the lava country had been estimated at £57,000 and the cost of providing a permanent metalled road from Jisr Ma Jamie to Mafrak at#&gt;80, 100. 6. COLONEL FLEMING said that the cost of a metalled road throughout would reach a figure far beyond any at presentHe gathered, however, that present contemplated* this was not required, hut that the need was to make the road passable throughout the year wherever this was necessary e.g. improvement of the whole lava road, strengthening of the crossings in the desert section, drainage. He also referred to the necessity of water supply at suitable distances along the route. He was not prepared there and then to give even an approximate estimate for this work, but he was convinced that £100,000 which had been tentatively mentioned, would be found quite inadequate. He thought that the figure for the whole route including the Iraq section would be more in the neighbourhood of £250,000 - £500,000. He would try and get enough information on which to base an estimate. 7’. The cost of improving the Iraq section was discussed and it was considered that this should not be excessive. The road through Iraq as far as Eamadi was merely a desert track but this was quite adequate for the traffic contemplated and the only work required would be on the crossings and on the short section west of Ramadi. The Iraq Government was understood to have been willing to spend £50,000 - £60,000 on their section of the route. 6. SIR C. PARKINSON raised the question of the incidence of cost. The Secretary of State for the Colonies had mentioned this question at the Ministerial Sub-Committee's meeting regarding the Railway and had referred to the fact that the Air Ministry attached importance to the road. The Secretary of State had gonegone on to say that the Palestine Government could he relied on to look after the roads in their territory and that they had also financed the improvement of a section of the road in Trans-Jordan. Nevertheless the High Commissioner for Palestine would find it difficult to .justify any further* grants from Palestine to Trans-Jordan for road improvement 5 and since the financial situation in Trans-Jordan precluded the Trans-Jordan Government from contributing anything for this purpose, any expenditure on the Trans-Jordan section must fall on the British Exchequer* 9« MR. WILKINSON said that at present the view of the Treasury was that Palestine should pay for the Trans-Jordan section. Palestine had the money available and the benefit to Palestine trade from the improvement of this road would be considerable. He expressed the view that the matter would have to be submitted to the Official Middle East Sub-Committee and thence to tlie Ministerial Sub-Committee for a decision. 10. MR. Y/ILLIAMS said that both Arabs and Jews had lately shewn an increasing tendency to criticise the manner in which Palestine spent its money and that serious political difficulty might be anticipated if further expenditure of Palestine funds in Trans jordan was proposed. 11« The possibility of getting assistance from the Colonial Development Fund was considered, but the conclusion was reached that thej?e was no likelihood of the Committee recommending so large a sum as would(?£&gt; Est i mate s of cost# Method ot approaching I raq GoYernsaent. he required. It was also agreed that a loan would rx»t he ^rscticafcl©. In this connection it was suggested that after the route v^as completed revenue might he obtained hy levying tolls. The oh,lection to this vras that it ndght militate against the economic value of the road hy discouraging traffic, especially since no such tolls are levied on the Syrian route, 12, SIR O'. PARKINSON said that the question of the incidence of cost could obviously not he taken much further until the probable cost of the undertaking was known. The estimate for the Palestine and Trans-Jordan section could be obtained with the help of the Grown Agents for the Colonies, and this estimate could then be referred to Palestine and Trans-Jordan for verifica tion by means of a local survey. In this connection COLONEL PLLI IPG explained that an elaborate survey would not be required. It would merely be a question of traversing the route and noting requirements at the various points. 13* The Air Ministry and \7ap Office representa tives said that there should be no difficulty in obtaining information as to the detailed requirements and a reasonably accurate estimate of the cost for the Iraq section; and undertook to have this done. 1'V, The meeting then discu.ssed the question of approaching the Iraq Government in the matter* MR. STSRITDALE-BLilN-ITT suggested that, this should be done in connection with the impending Palestine-Iraq Trade Agreement, The latest information about the Trade ./Agreement was that the Palestine Government were considering certain amendments proposed by the Iraqi Government and that the latter were prepared, if thoseamendments were accepted, to send representatives to Palestine to sign the Agreement® In his opinion the heat course would he for the Palestine Government bo take the matter up when they replied to the last despatch from Baghdad* They ndght point out that m pursuance of the provisions of the Agreement relating to road construction the Palestine and '.0rans— hord&amp;ii Governments were examining the question of sap rowing their section of the road so as to make it suivahle i-or traffic in all weathers and were contemplating a survey to ascertain the cost of the work, and they might ask for an assurance that the ‘ raq. Govemiaent would f ^r their part take similar measures with regard :q the Iraq section* He thouglit that the matter should only 'be dealt with on broad lines in the first instance hut that no time should he lost in acquainting the Iraqis with the intention to improve the Palestine and Trans- of road contemplated was said to he adequate for great quantity* it was thought that it was now feasible at present to attempt to provide for a road o the requirements of military reinforcements and commercial Jordan sections. much higher •quality of road would be necessary it tourist and passenger traffic was to he attracted in a the standard required to attract passenger traffic as such, and that efforts s?iould he confined to meeting transport*transport* It was possible tbat further improvement might follow later 5 ; and the route was well established, if prospective passenger traffic justified it* 16* The conclusions of the meeting were:- (1) That the colonial Office* in consultation with the Crown Agents for the Colonies* should obtain an estimate of the cost cf improving the road in Palestine and Trans^Jordan so as to make it suitable for traffic in all weathers and that this estimate shou! d be referred to Palestine and Trana^Jor&amp;an for verifieat jn by a local survey® (2) That the Air Ministry and War Office should obtain detailed information of requirements with an estimate of the cost for such improvement of the road ij Iraq as may be considered necessary® (3) That the High Commissioner for Palestine shoul. 1 be requested to breach the matter in gene?oal terms with the Iraq Government in connection with the impending Palestine-Iraq Trade Agreement® (h) That the question of the incidence of cost fo 2 the Trans-Jordan section of the road should be deferred for consideration at a laterCROWN AGKNTS ?OR THE COLONIES. 4, HILLSANK, WESTMINSTER, LONDON, So Wo 4th May, 1935o Dear Williams^ In reply to your letter No* 79049/2/35 of the 15th Marche I am afraid it is impossible, with the information I have been able to obtain from all sources including the Iraq petroleum Co a , v/ho have been most helpful, to give a reliable estimate of the cost of constructing an all-weather road from Haifa to the Iraq. Frontier to fulfil the conditions required© It may, however, be of some use if I give some indication of the possible costs under various heads, talcing the road section by section© Pale stine - Haifa to Jorda n Valley.; From Haifa to Samakh will involve no additional cost as the existing road is adequate for all-weather traffic* The remaining 5 miles from Samakh to Jisr- Majamie is only suitable for dry weather traffic s but should present no great difficulties ? and nc doubt the Palestine Government will deal with this© jisg i4mLg__- to Mafrak via Irbid - 55 miles© This section is the most difficult© It is understood that £28,500 is contemplated to be spent as a minimumv2&gt;H minimum to keep this section open for traffic in the wet season a It v/ould appear very prohahle that this would be totally inadequate to provide a road in all weathers for commercial traffic or military requirements. The sum contemplated may be enough to provide an al-^weather traffic surface on a foundation adequate only for light vehic.les such as passenger motor cars* but quite useless, owing to lack of adequate foundations and drainage, for heavy commercial or military vehicleso The road crossing the plain from the Jordan Valley to the foot'’ hills below Samma, due to heavy rains and inundations, was out of commission for practically the whole of last February, and heavy transport was diverted to the route Jerusalem t* Amman *» Mafrako 1 estimate that to provide a road of the character required for vehicles with axle loads of 5-g- tons would cost approximately £?5,000 on this secticno M afrak to _the 3 r aq Frontier_o At 1.1afrak the desert country commences and the distance from Mafrak to the Iraq Frontier is about 174 mileSo The lava belt commences 10 miles east of Mafrak and extends for a distance of 114 miles and through this belt a road exists which was constructed by the Iraq petroleum Company for the transport of materials for the pipe line., This road had a good foundation when originally constructed by the Iraq petroleum Company but during the period when it was being used for '-he construction of the pipe line many short sections gave considerable trouble and are now definitely bad in wet weather; these would have to be remadeo No satisfactory binding material is available locally, and the surface is liableliable to be blown off leaving the rough material exposed* The Iraq Petroleum Company employed gangs to make good the surface as it was destroyed, as presumably this Was cheaper than treating the surface with cement or bitumastic material* In the winters 1932*19153 and 1933- 1934, practically no shut-downs were experienced on the road through the lava belt with the exception of two days in 1933-1934 when, in certain places, the road was impassable tc heavy trucks P In the winter 1934-1935 due to heavy rains, a number of stoppages were experienced, usually of one day’s duration and, on two occasions, of three days’ duration due tc washouts* A,t one point drainage water covered the track to a depth of about 3 feet and this caused a shut-down of transport for three days, difficulties have arisen each winter between the termination of the lava road and the Iraq Frontier as, ^.n places, the ground is low and appears to be a drainage area. In the winter 1934*1935 this section was completely impassable for one period of four days and for another period of three days and even after the flood waters had drained away the road was heavy and difficult and vehicles were liable to be bogged unless in the hands of experienced drivers,, A short section of the lava belt road was experimentally treated with bitumen and has stood up extremely well after two years of operation by heavy transport* I estimate the cost of providing a satisfac tory surface throughout the whole length of the lava belt road would cost approximately £l50,000o Between Mafrak and the Iraq Frontier there is a length of about 10 miles west of the lava belt road and about» al^out 50 miles east of* the lava helt road over v/hich no read has been constructed^, on these sections the Iraq Petroleum Company found that the ground surface was suitable in dry weather for vehicular transport, provided the loads were kept down to about half the normal loadsc, In wet weather, however, these sections were impassable as lorries would sink up to their axles but, even under the severe conditions of 193^-1935, the total number of days shut-down on the section between Mafrak and Rutbah did not exceed 18 days in total with maximum continuous periods of three days principally experienced during the months of December and February 0 30 far as I have been able to find out, there is no stone suitable for road construction on these sections, and although suitable basalt could be collected in the lava country, the cost of transport would be very high on sections at all remote from the lava belt areao To summarise, I estimate it would be necessary to expend the following sums to provide a road which might be considered as open for all seasons, except for short intervals during the rainy season;- 5 J isr- Ma jamie to Mafrak via Irb ld - 35 miles, £75,000•- Mafrak to Iraq Frontier 0 £150,000v I do not consider it possible to estimate for the work necessary to make an all-weather road throughout without an adequate reconnaissance and recommend that the best Course would be to expend up to £250,000 on the work suggested above and carry out the extra work entailed in making the Yvhole v/eather proof in all seasons, as experience shows the essential work required,, In this category of essential work I particularly refer to Irish bridges, drainage„drainage, sections of metalling, special treatment of surface and other methods required to combat sudden floods, ’’wash outs’*, etCo-1- DOWNING STREET 30th May, 1935.

With reference to my confidential telegram No. 50 of the 21st of February, I have ''he honou* to transmit to you the record of a meeting held at the Colonial Office on the 15th of February to consider the improvement of roaa communication 'between Haifa ana Baghdad via Trans-Jordan. 2. As I informed you m my telegram under reference, one of the conclusions of the meeting was that the Crown Agents for the Colonies should obtain a preliminary estimate of the cost of improving the section of the trans desert read which passes through Palestine ana Trans-Jordan so as to make it suitable for traffic in all ’weathers, and that this estimate should be referred to Palestine and Trans-Jordan fox verification by a local survey. I now enclose a copy of a letter from Colonel Fleming on this subject. 3. In the second paragraph of his letter Colonel Fleming states that the existing road between Haifa and Samakh is adequate for all-weather traffic, but that the remaining five miles from Samakh to Jisr-Majarnie are only suitable for traffic in dry weather.

They have, however, been able as a result of the investigations which have so far been made, to draw up a statement (attached as an Appendix to this letter) showing the standard to which it is believed that the road can reasonably be brought. This statement also shows the present condition of the road and the steps which might be taken to achieve the desired standard* It may. of course, be necessary to amend this statement as the result of further discussion on the return of Colonel Turner* 3® A copy of this letter is being sent to the Colonial Office and the Air Ministry.

There are usually two or three falls a month# The total rainfall over the six months averages 4 to 6 inches# (b) T he effect on the Track,, After heavy rain the track becomes impassable either owing to wadis coming down in spate as occurs between the Trans-Jordan Frontier and Rutbah, or owing to the surface becoming soft and muddy as occurs between Rutbah and Ramadi# As a rough guide, it may be said that the track becomes impassable after six hours heavy rain and remains so for tv/ice the length of time over which rain has fallen# ( c ) Military requirements# What is required from a military point o: view is a road which will be passable through* its length in good weather and on which the minimum of delay will be caused by wet weather Part 2# Military Traffic# For the advance and maintenance of a force such as that which it has been suggested should be sent to Iraqas a reinforcement in an emergency, the road v/ould he required to stand up to the following traffic (a) Initial Advance. Heavy traffic for one or two days, loQo up to 800 vehicles the weights of which may he classified as under:- (figures only approximate) 12 vehicles of 10 tons, 200 vehicles of 8 toils, 500 vehicles of about 4-5 tons* 500 vehicles (light lorries, vans, cars and motor-cycles)• (b) Su bseq uently• About forty vehicles of 8 tons weight over each section of the track daily. Part 5, General Description of the Road, ( a ) T rans-Jordan Fronti er to Rutbah, On this part of the track the desert is hard and the surface is not affected by rain. There are, however, a certain number of wadis which are liable to come down in spate and interrupt traffic ror some hours. The Wadi Hauran# 500 yards west of Rutbah Port is the largest of these wadis and delay is particularly likely to occur here. It is not necessary, except at the Wadi Houran, to provide bridges at these wadis. Nor is it considered practicable to provide all-weather crossings. The wadis are few and owing to the danger of spates washing away the material, or of slack water undermining them by its seeping action, crossings would be useless. Except!4f&lt;f Except after rain these wadis are dry and present a very small obstacle. It is therefore not considered necessary^ for military traffic* to provide ramps. In the event of a force having to move along the route* ramps could be prepared quickly and easily by advance parties in as many places as possible so as to avoid the cutting up of the approaches by excessive traffic® At the pumping station at Ho3.* however* traffic converges and the track is already becoming cut up® A military force would use H«3. as a staging point. It is therefore important that the track should be improved and it is suggested that the mix-in-place method could be employed here. A small length ofmix-in-plcce road at either end of the Wadi Hauran bridge would also be necessary^ (b) Rutbah to Ram adi* It is in this section where the soil is a mixture of clay and gravel* that the track becomes impassable after rain, particularly in two or three places where it passes through depressions. The total length of these bad patches, one of which is just west of Ramadi, is believed to be some 10 to 12 miles. Unfortunately, the expense of making a permanent track in this section of the route would probably be high, as owing to the nature of the soil the mix-in-place method could not be employed unless sand were traJisported from elsewhere.

The Director of public ycrks, Palestine, informs me that he is in general agreement with the report, except as regards the period estimated to be required f^r completion of the work (paragraph XIV)* Having regard to the difficult country to be negotiated, and the scarcity of water, Mr 3 pudsey is of the opinion that it would be impossible to complete the project in less than three years from the date of the arrival of the equipment 3o It will be observed that the report sets out five alternative degrees of efficiency which might beaimed at in the construction and improvement of the road and giver estimates of the capital and recurrent coat in each case,an follow: (i) Proposal A: to construct a waterbound macadam road with all necessary culverts, on only those sections of the road which experience has shown are likely to become impassable in wet weather, namely the section from near Si Hosn to Mafrak, the unmetalled parts oi the Iraq petroleum Company's roao through the lava country, and certain parts of the section from the eastern extremity of that road to the Iraq frontier. Hast of Mafrak the track to be carried across the larger water courses by means of properly constructed causeways. The estimated capital expenditure on this scheme would be LP.214.000 and the annual cost of maintenance LP.42,000. (ii) Proposal B. to construct a waterbound macadam road throughout, with the exception of the metalled road built by the Iraq Petroleum Conn any through the lava country, road to be fully furnished with culverts, but east of Mafrak the larger water-courses to be crossed by means of causeways. Estimated capital cost LP. 512,000; annual cost of maintenance LPo46^000o (111) proposal C: to construct a waterbound macadam road throughout* Including the reconstruction of the Iraq, petroleum company's roed through the lava country and .ne realignment of certain parts of the latter road.

As Mr, Taylor points out in the final paragraph of his no te,note 9 the maintenance of an earth-hound macadam road through the desert entails special difficulties 0 Consequently, if semething more than the hare minimum to make the road reasonably dependable is envisaged, I should strongly recommend that either proposal D or proposal K should adoptedo The choice between these two would depend chiefly on the funds available* Mr* Ghorayeb explains, at page 4 of his report, the reasons why the realignment of the lava road is desirable, but it appears that it would be possible to defer this? sines proposal D includes provision for the realignment and rec nstruction of those parts of this section of the road on which wash-outs occurred during the rainy season of 1934/35* 5o It will be observed that in paragraphs IX y X and XI of his report Mr Ghorayeb suggests that it will bo necessary to make s ^eoial arrangements to preserve the health and general security of the officers and workmen employed on the roai* and to maintain uninterrupted communication betwe ;n the Headquarters of his Department and the road* The press it estimates do not include any provision for such .ervices* The reason for this is that any forecast which can be made at the presen- time of the requisite ex senditure would be entirely speculativeo Some temporary expansion of the Depart ments concerned v/ou d no doubt be necessary, but the expenditure involved will depend on a great variety of questions, for example* whether the work will be continued throughou ^ the yeai* or will be suspended during tbs• -the rainy season; whether it will be carried out by a single party progressing from one extremity to the other of the road, or by two or more parties working simultaneously on different sections; to what extent the existing personnel of the Arab Legion can be made available for protectioA of the staff and workers® As regards the question of communications the British Resident informs me that the suggested erection of a pair of wires, for the use of the Department of public .orka, on the poles of the Iraq petroleum Company, would be extremely expensive and he advises, if it should prove to be impossible to make arrangements for the use of the existing telephones at the Company^ stations, that a portable v/ireless telegraph set for the use of the road-making party would be much less costly® He also states that there is no necessity for the provision of an edditional pair of wires from Mafrak to Amman, as advocated by Mr® Ghorayeb, as a first class telephone line already exists between those two stations® 6® The cost of the survey, v/hich, as Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister anticipated, is not large, is being met from Palestine funds in the first instance, but I assume that the final allocation of the charge will be reviewed when the question of the incidence of the cost of improving and maintaining the road through Trans-Jordan is decided® As you are aware, the cost of essential works of reconstruction of certain parts of this road lying between Jisr Majami 1 and Liafrak, amounting to LP&lt;;31 8 760, is being met from Palestine funds, and I take this opportunity of repeating that I do not contemplate that anyany expenditure on this road eastward of* Llafrak. should be borne by Palestineo I am now considering the question of the maintenance of the ?econstrueted Jisr Majami — Mafrak section^ and shall iddress you separately on this question in due cou^seo 7 q ',/ith rega rd to paragraph 3 of the despatch under reference I have to inform you that the five miles of road from Samakh to Jisr Majami’ referred to by Colonel Fleming are identical with the Saraakh - Jisr Majarai 1 road for the improvement of which a sum of Lp=6,500 has been provided under Item 105 of Head XXVII of the Palestine Ksaimates for the current financial yearo The work is nearly complete and the read in question will shortly be suitable for all kinds of traffic in all weatl srs 0 I have , etco , (Sgdo) Arthur Wauchopeo HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR PALESTINE AND TRANSJORDAN*CON FIDENTIA L, 2/3/20. October 4th 1935o Director of public orl':s ? jeruaalemo Subject: Mafraq. Roado I have to confirm that I have assisted Mr, Ghorayeb in making his report on the preliminary reconnaissance survey and estimates of the Haifa Baghdad Hoad, and 1 find myself in agreement with him in his recommendations, with one minor exception, namely, the employment of contract transport as opposed to departmental transport, as X am of the opinion that the latter method would give much greater dependability and would be considerably cheaper than the 60 mils per m3 per kilo allowed in the estimates. There are, however, one or two points which 1 consider it would be well to amplify: The first ^s to explain the choice of a 4 metres rather than a 5 metres road from Si Husn (K.49) to the T, j„ Ira(1 Frontier,, [K^6k) Visibility is good over the whole of this section, on coming traffic being clearly discernible from a long distance, hence a 4 me-res Y/xd-i. should be sufficient for safety and xor the present demands of t-he road© The second point to which I would like to uraw attention is the proposed substitution of the .veil built causeways for the conventional bridges. It is considered, from experience of roads under similar conditions (for instance, the Jericho- Beisan Road in the Jordan Valley) thatthat a well built causeway Is, when dealing with abnormal capricious rainfall, both cheaper and more dependable than a bridge built without adequate data. It should be recognised, however, that when a wadi is in fuU spate a causeway might be rendered impassable by the depth of water flowing oyer it; but the delay, possibly only a matter of hours thus caused, would be short com pared with the delay caused by the failure of a bridge on its approaches;. The third and last point is that before, any permanent work is coitinned beyond the intersection of the pipe line and the Irbid - Jerash Road (K»49) the I.P.C. should be requested to state in what position, in relation tc their 30 metres right of way, they wish the 20 or 30 metres rose ' vat ion for the road to he placed, tc this connection i'i is explained that the I.P.C. read through the Lava District is too close to the pipe line to allow for safety when blasting for drains etv. Further it is understood that the I.P.C, propose to lay another pipe somewhere within their 30 metres and the ultimate position of the road should be laid out with an ample allowance fc r these two pipes and any other future line. It is for this reason rather than for any improvement in grade that the re-alignment of the Lava read is held to he ef sentialo X strongly recommend the adoption of bituminous construction estimated for under proposal D or S.

Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 79049/2/35 of the 1st February, trans mitting copy of a despatch, together with enclosures thereto, from the High Oouimissioner for Palestine and Trans-Jordan, xegarding the improvement of road communication betweeu Haifa and Baghdad. 2. The repoi't by Mr. Ghorayeb, Trans-Jordan Director of Public Works, which accompanied your letter, includes several alternative estimates for improving road transport facilities between Palestine and Iraq, varying from the minimum expenditure necessary to provide a road which is passaole in all weathers, to the provision oi an asphalted road throughout the entire length. 3. The report and estimates are based ^pon a preliminary survey covering a total length of 364 kms., which only occupied three days, ana it is clear, therefore, that it was not possible to make precise measurements. Distances v/ere aetermined by a car speedometer while visual estimates only were made of the lengths of aeviations. Irish briages, etc* Much of the territory covered is, however, flat, and heavy earth works, bridge work, etc., are unnecessary. It is not difficult, therefore to determine the quantities of the wok to be executed ^nd if the unit rates are accurate, the cost of carrying out the work should not vary wiuely from the estimate. The Under Secretary of State, COLONIAL OFFICE.-2- 4. • The report points out that the section between Haifa and Samakh is already in a first class asphalted conuition, and that the portion between 3amakh and Jisr el hajaini v/ill oe in a similar condition oy March, 1936. The report deals, there fore, with the section hetween Jisr el Mao ami &amp;nci the Iraq. Frontier, a total length of 364 kus. This length of road is uividea for convenience into fxve sections, the junctions between the sections being at the following points:— Junction of the Iraq Petroleum Company’s ■nine line track with the Jerash - Irbid road. (a) 49.0 kms. (h) 81.0 kms • (c) S6.5 kms. (d) 274. 0 kms. (e) 364. 0 kms. Railway lj.ne at Mafraq. Comiiencement of the I.P.C. lava metal x*oau • 5. The woi'st x^u^'ts of the first section ii-om 0.0. to 4S.0 kms. had been drained, soled ana metalled at the time the report was prepared, ana it was thought that the work a ould be completed by the end of November, 1935. A length of 13 kms. was 'being left untouched as it was considered to oe passable even m wet weather. 6. It is feared that the second section 49.0 - 61.0 lens, will give trouble m wet weather throughout its entxre length, ana the present location is not considered suitable for a permanent road that will ultimately develop into a first class highway. Eventually re-alignment will he required with a possible increase m length from 32 to 38 kins. 7 . Section 3, 81.0 - 96.5 kms. is a Hat plain and can be regarded as passable in all but exceptionally wet weather. 8. Section 4, 96.5 - 274 kms. covers the length of the I.P.C. lava road, hut the report states that the alignments ana gradients adopted hy the Company are oy nomeans satisfactoiy for a first class highway. Five unmetalled gaps exist ana at some of these gaps deviation through the upper adjacent grouna is recom.ienued. 9, The last section from 274.0 - 364.0 tens, is in flat plain country with short intervals of undulation ana the sections between 274 - 294 tens, ana 320 - 364 m^s. gi ve txouoie in wet weather. 10. Proposal (A) provides for the construction of a road over those sections only which are considered to be impassable in wet weather. The sections to be dealt with are as follows Between 0.0 ana 49.0 tens. Nil. H 49.0 and 81.0 tens. 3 3 tens. (length of re-alignment ) It 81.0 and 96.5 tens. Nil. It 96.5 and 274.0 tens. 13 tens. of gaps. 11 274.0 and 294.0 tens. 20 tens. M 294.0 and 3 20.0 tens . Nil. tt 320.0 and 364.0 teas. 44 tens. Total 115 tens. A 7 metre width of fomnation is proposed with a water bound macadam surface 4 metres wiue of zO cm. (8”) layer of soling and a 6 cm. (2.l/2 ,, ) layer of consolidated metal. The cost is estimated to amount to LP.214,000 which is equivalent to LP.1,861 per ten. or LP.2,978 per mile. 11. Proposal (B) provides for a water oound macadam surface (20 cm. soling and 6 cm. of metal) ovex the whole road between Jisr el .tvlujamx ana the Jraq Frontier with the exception of the re-alignment and reconstruction of the already metalled parts of the I.P.J. road between 96,5 ana 274 tens. The estimate includes for widening certain sections between 0,0 and 49.0 tens, to an 8 metre width of formation and a 6 metre width of -3-' -4- macadam surface. It also includes for constructing 1-3 kms. oJ new roadway on this section. The total cost if estimated to amount to LP. 3l£ ,000 hut omitting the section from 0.0 to 49.0 kms. where the work largely consists of widening the existing r®ad, the cost of new road between 49.0 kms. and 364.0 kms. , 16 6.5 kms. in length, will amount to LP.^94,357 which is equivalent to LP.1,881 per km. or LP.3,010 per mile, l^. proposal (C) covers the whole of the work provided for under proposal (b) and also the construction of a v,ater hound macadam surface over the whole length of the I.P.C. road which would he re-aligned. Proposal (c) , therefore, provides for a water hound macadam surfaced road over the whole length hetweea Jisr el Majami and the Iraq I rentier. It is estimated that the total cost would amount to LP. 5^0 ,000 or LP.50^,357 fo? 3u4.5 kms. of new road hetween49.0 and 364.0 kms. This is equivalent to an average cost of LP.1,548 per km. or LP.h &gt; 477 per mile* 13. Proposal (f). The works suggested under this propo sal are the same as those suggested under proposal (b) with the exception that bituminous pre-mixed metal and cnippings are substituted for water hound macadam. The total cost is estimated to amount to LP.443,000 or, omitting again the sec tion between 0.0 and 49.0 kms. the cost is LP. 397 ,737 for 156.5 kms. of new road, which is equal to LP.^,543 per km. or LP.4,067 per mile. 14. Proposal (E) is similar to proposal (0) with the ex ception that bituminous pre-mixed metal and chippings is sub stituted for water hound macadam. If proposal (n) is adop ted, a bituminous road surface would he provided over the wnole distance between Haifa and the Iraq Frontier. The total cost is estimated to amount to LP. 760,000 or, omitting the first section from 0.0 to 49.0 kms., LP. 714,787 for 3^4.5 kms.2^ I] of nev; roadway. This is equivalent to an average cost of LP. 6 9 z03 per km. or LP.3 s 5h5 per mile. 15. Mr. G-norayeh points out &gt; on page 6 of nis report ^ that the traffic between Jisr el Majami and Irbid (0.0 to 38.0 kms.) is more than double that on other sections of the road and the volume of traffic is increasing. u e therefore rocom .ends in all of the proposals, except that of (A) , that the road on this sec tion should be widened from 6 to 8 metres and the metalled por tion from 4 to 6 metres. The section between irbid and husn (38.0 - 46.0 kms.) is already constructed with a road bed of 7 metres and a metalled section of 5 metres and no further widening is considered necessary at present. For all other sec tions of the road it is suggested that the formation width should be 7 metres and the metalled width 4 metres. A width of 4 metres is not sufficient to enable two cars to pass on the me talled portion and one car, therefore, would be diverted on to the unmetr-lled . formation, but so long as the traffic is light we do not see any serious objection to this. 16. The estimates provide for culverts and bridges on the sectioxi west of Mafraq but, east of Mafraq, for culverts and causeways only as adequate data regarding rainfall, catch ment areas etc. , is not available to determine the dimensions of permanent bridges. 17. It is anticipated that the cost of labour will be materially greater east of Mafraq and, on this account, an addition of 80 per cent has been made to a number of the items on all sections east of the railway line. 18. The estimates now submitted are the most detailed we have yet seen for this work and care has evidently been taken in determining the cost of plant, water supply, otc. Mr. Ghorayeb, who is the Director of Public works, Trans-Jordan, should be familiar with the cost of road construction in this-6- district and should he chle* therefore* to estimate closely the unit rates for carrying out work of this character. Although 5 therefore 9 no detailed survey has been made we think the estimates should provide a fairly accurate indication of what the work is likely to cost. The estimates do not in clude the cost of arrangements necessary to preserve the health and security of the officers and workmen employed on construction. 19. Mr. G-horayeb estimates that the yearly cost of main tenance and construction would be as follows: Maintenance. Construction. Proposal (A). LP. *000 LP. *14,000 n (B). LP. 46,000 LP. 31*,000 ii (c). LP. 46,000 LP. 5&lt;o0 ,0^0 11 (r&gt;). LP. 35 *000 LP. 443,000 U (B). LP. £3 *000 LP. 760 &gt;000 A1though the cost of carrying out proposal (L) is LP.546,000 more than proposal (A)* the estimated saving in the yearly cost of maintenance would suffice to pay per cent on the additional expenditure. isO. Mr. (ihorayeb estimates that the work can be carried out in two years &gt; but the Director of xUblic works «, Palestine^ is of the opinion that the work would take at least three years from the date of the arrival of the equipment. ^ 1 . In the last paragraph of your letter of the 1 st Feb ruary* you ask us- to furnish our observations on the relation between the estimates enclosed with your letter and tnose sub mitted by the Palestine Corporation Limited. We commented upon the Palestine Corporation’s proposals in our letter of the 30th November* wherein we pointed out that a sum of £1*000*000 was suggested for constructing a road from Mafraq to Pamadi 7&lt;iO kms. in length* and of this length 370 kms. were situate in plain desert ground* where it was contemplatedlittle work was nectssary other than levelling. Over the remainder of the distance, namely 350 Ians., it was proposed to 'build a properly formed road with a 'bitumastic surface at a cost of approximately LP.950,000 or LP.4,3dO per mile. Mr.Ghorayeh f s report deals with the section between Jisr el Majami and the Iraq frontier, a total length of 364 Ians., of which a short length requires widening only. The cost of constructing 304.5 kms. of new roadway with a bitumastic surface is estimated to cost LP.3,505 per mile. The Palestine Corporation proposed to construct a road 5 metres vide, whereas Mr.Ghorayeh’s estimate provides only for a 4 metre width of metal surface, and he says that the cost of increasing the width by 1 metre would add 05 ;j to the cost, i.e. he estimates that the cost is proportional to the width, which we think is likely to prove substantially true. Mr.Ghorayeb, therefore, estimates that a road 5 metres wide would cost LP. 3,505 plus 05, j or LP.4,406 per mile, a xigur-o which agrees very closely with the Palestine Corporation s estimate of LP.4,300 per mile. 22 , Similar agreement will not be found if the details of the two estimates are compared. V/e attach two appendices showing details of both estimates applied to the section between 0'74 and 364 kms; which is duscribed as plain desert country, exclusive of the cost of bridges. The details in Appendix 1 have been extracted from Mr. Ghorayeb’s estimate and show that the cost of constructing a water bound macadam road 4 metres wide would amount to LP.5,350 per mile, wnile the cost of constructing a bituminous macadam road would amount to LP.2,960 per mile. The figures in Appendix 2 have been extracted from .Appendix II of the estimate which was attached to the Palestine Corporation’s letter of the 14th October, 1935, and from these figures it would appearthat the cost of constructing n water hound macadam road 5 metres wide would amount to LP.797 per mile and the cost of constructing a road with ''Shelmac 11 surface would amount to LP.1,765 por mile, according to the detailed estimate the cost of constructing 7a0 kms. of road was expected to amount to LP.450,000, hut to this figure the sum of LP, 350,000 was subsequently added ''in order to allow sufficient margin for error in the Kngineer's estimates , while a further addition of 20 per cent was made for administration costs. Those additions have the effect of doubling the figures in the detailed estimate, and presumably the cost per tan. and per mile, quoted m appendix 2 attached, require to be doubled. We have, however, little confidence in the details of an estimate which subsequently requires doubling to provide a margin for errors. 23. It will be seen, from paragraph 11 above, that under proposal (B) the construction of 156.5 kms. of new road is estimated to cost LP.3,010 per mile, while in paragraph 12 the construction of 324,5 tans, of new road under proposal (c) is estimated to cost only LP.2,477 per mile. This difference is explained by the fact that proposal (c) includes the construction of a new road through the lava belt where suitable material for soling and metalling are readily available. In consequence the rates in Mr.Ghorayeb's estimate for collecting stones for soling ,.nd metalling the section through the lava belt are appreciably less than the rates .allowed for other sections of the work, while it has not been necessary to include an item for transport of the stone from quarries, etc. Further, the amounts allowed for water supply, mechanical equipment, plant and tools are proportionately less on the longer length of construction included under proposal ( C ). The same reasons explain the-9- difference betv/een the cost per mile for propospl ( D) in paragraph 13 and. the cost per mile for proposal ( E) in paragraph 14. 24. In the Memorandum dated December, 1934, which was prepared in the Colonial Office, it is stated in paragraph 2 that it was very desirable that a 'passable all-weather road' between Haifa and Baghdad should be established in order to foster the use of the Transjordan road until the railv/ay should be completed. This is the work covered by proposal (A) in Mr. Ghorayeb’s report and is estimated to cost LP.214,000 for the length between Jisr el Majami and the Iraq Frontier. 25. To provide a proper asphalt road throughout the total.distance 'would cost LP. 760,000, which is equivalent to an average cost of LP. 3,525 per mile, which we can only regard as a very high figure for a road 4 metres wide in a district where the cost of earth works, bridges, etc. , is comparatively negligible. 26. From Mafraq on the railway to the Iraq frontier is 283 kms. and Mr, Ghorayeb estimates that the cost of providing an asphalt road over this length would amount to LP. 667,530, while the cost of maintenance would be about LP. 18,000 annually which, if capitalised at 3f per cent, would amount to about LP. 500,000. If this figure is added to the cost of construction, a total of LP. 1,167,530 is obtained, which is equal to LP. 6,600 per mile. Me believe that it should be possible to provide and equip a railway of the pioneer type at no greater cost and, if such a railway could earn its wording expenses, it would appear to be preferable to spend the money on a railway instead of on a road, as we think there is little question that the cost of transport by railway would be less than by road.

I have the honour to transmit to you a copy of a letter which has been received from the Palestine Corporation Limited containing proposals for the construction of a road from Haifa to Baghdad. No spare copies of the cross sections or map which form Appendices III and IV are available. A copy of an interim reply which has been sent to the Company is also enclosed. 2 . The proposals made by the Corporation have received some preliminary consideration by the interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government, and I wish to draw your attention to certain points which arise. 3. It will be necessary to consider whether the proposals of the Corporation are in conformity with the provisions of the Mandate for Palestine. The Corporation’s scheme involves a monopoly of the traffic on the proposed route. The determining factors, as you will appreciate, are whether it can be shown to be in the interests of Palestine and Transjordan, in order to secure the efficient con struction of the road, (a) that such a concession should be granted to this Corporation without inviting other tenders; and (b) that a monopoly of the traffic should be granted to this or to any other Company.

List of Directors. fact the list Another question which needs consideration is the that the corriposition of the Board of Directors of Corporation is almost entirely Jewish. I enclose a of the Directors of the Corporation. I am doubtful whether a scheme for road construction and traffic operated by a company of Jewish composition would be acceptable to the Transjordan Government, and. I understand that, in the opinion of the Foreign Office, a concession to such a company is unlikely to commend, itself to the Iraqi Govern ment. The only action which the Foreign Office propose to take now is to forward a copy of the Corporation’s letter to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad, for his own information, w/ith an intimation that it is not considered, that the proposals should, be brought to the notice of the Iraqi Government at the present stage. g t Assuming, however, that there should be no objection to the scheme in principle, the financial and economic aspects will require careful examination. It will oe noted, inter alia , that the Corporation would require a guarantee by the Governments of Palestine, Transjordan c-.nd Iraq to the extent of approximately £70,000 per annum for a period of 20 years. 6 . I shall be obliged if I may be furnished with your view/s on the Corporation’s proposals at your early con venience. Meanwhile, a copy of the Corporation’s letter has been forwarded to the Crown Agents for the Colonies with a request that they will furnish their preliminary observations on the proposals from the technical point of view/, w/ith special reference to the engineering estimates; but I have not thought it desirable to delay this despatch for the receipt of their comments.7. shall also be obliged if you will inform me when you are likely to be in a position to reply to my predecessor's confidential despatch of the 00 th ilay regarding the improvement of road communic tion between Haifa and Baghdad.

ENCLOEUREo. Sir I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, No. 79069/35 of the 22nd November, transmitting copy of a despatch (with its enclosures) which had been addressed to the High Commissioner for Palestine and Trans-Jordan regarding proposals which have been submitted by the Palestine Corporation Limited for the construction of a road from Haifa to Baghdad. 2, We have examined very carefully the Corporation's proposals from the technical point of view, and have also investigated their estimates of cost. It is always difficult, without proper surveys, to estimate accurately the cost of work spread over so long a distance and, until the Palestine Government submit the estimates asked for in the despatch which was addressed to the High Commissioner on the 30th May, it will be difficult to determine with any exactitude what the construction of a road connecting Palestine and Iraq will cost. In the meanwhile we should like, however, to make certain observations on the estimates which accompanied your letter under acknowledg ment. 3. In Appendix 1, attached to the Corporation^* letter of the 14th October, it is suggested that the cost of The Under Secretary of State, COLONIAL OFFICE. —*—“of 1)uildin g a ^oad will vary according to the character or the districts passed through* hut the different forms construction can he classified under four general types varying in cost as follows:- Type I Plain Desert Ground - £p c 100 per Knic II Hilly Ground ~ £P. 1,460 per Km. III New Road in Lava Country £P. 1,000 1 IV Improvement of existing Road in Lava Country - £P,,925 « » The distance from Mafrak to Ramadi is 720 Km,, and of this length 6V0 Km., or rather over half, will he in ”plain dtir ' e t ground'’ where, it is contemplated, little work is necessary other than levelling. Over less than a half to '..•oil distance, viz. 550 Km., it is proposed to huild a properly formed road with a hitumastic surface, Coj.onel Fleming, in a semi-official letter of the 'irfcn May to Mr. O.G.R.T/illiams, stated that he estimated the cost of providing a satisfactory surface throughout the whole length of the lava belt road would amount to approximately £150,000. The distance through une Java belt is about 114 miles, so that Colonel Fleming estimated that this section of the road would approximately £1,516 per mile. This agrees f closely with the estimate for Type III road in country” given above. cost airly lava jOi.ails showing how the various estimates for different types of road construction have been mode up are given m Appendix 2, from which it will be seen that from 80 to 90 per cent of the total cost is required for providing the bitumastic surfacing, and that very little provision has been considered necessary for earth works, b ridge work, etc.6* It is anticipated that the net cost of constructing the road will be:- Type I 370 Km, at £P*100 - £P,37,000 Type II 160 Km, at £P, 1,460 - £P.233,500 Type III 50 Km, at £P. 1,000 - £P,50,000 Type IV 140 Km, at £P.925 -£P. 129,500 720 Km, £P&gt;450,000 It is, however, suggested that the sum of £350,000 should be added to the above figure 'in order to allow a stifficient margin for error in the Engineers* estimates', while a further addition of 20fo is also made for administration costs and a figure of £P.1,000,000 is advanced as the total cost of construction of the Mafrak ~ Ramadi road. Assuming that 370 Km. of desert road can be constructed for £P.50,000 the sum of £P&lt;,950,000 remains for constructing 350 Km. of road, i*e. £Pc2,700 per Km. or £P.4,320 pei^ mile, which we can only regard as an extraordinarily high figure for any road where the cost of earthworks, bridge work etc. is negligible* 7. If the detailed estimates advanced by the Corporation are of any value, it is difficult to understand vhe necessity for more than doubling them as has been done* The detailed estimates in Appendix 2 allow 20fo for contingencies, and this we consider should be ample. The factor in the work which is most difficult to estimate is the cost of transport of men and materials, but this item should present little difficulty to Engineers who are familiar with the country, as motor vehicles of all kinds have been operated between Palestine and Iraq for several years. 8» On the second page of their letter the Palestine Corooration suggest that the capital cost of road constructionconstruction, termini and rolling stock would not -be more than one eighth of the cost of a railway. The Corporation are doubtless comparing their estimate of £1,000,000 Liessrs. Rendel, Palmer and Tritton’s estimate of approximately £7,750,000 for the construction of a railway. It must not, however, he overlooked that the Consulting Engineers* estimate provides for a railway o.o miles long between Haifa and Baghdad, and Includes &lt; expensive section between the Jordan Crossing and lrbid ? whilst the Corporation*s estimate of £1,000,000 only covers the construction of 350 Km., i.e. 220 miles, of road. The Consulting Engineers’ estimate of cost the section between Irbid and Hit, which covers the whole length of the Mafrak - Ramadi road, amounted to an average, exclusive of rolling stock, of £8,600 per mile or less than double the cost of the proposed road. Further the Consulting Engineers provided in their estimate for a well ballasted railway of 4’ - B.1/2X gauge of very sound construction, and a railway oi the pioneer type could undoubtedly be builu for appro-, labj y less. 9. in the last page of their letter the Palestine Corporation suggest that the Governments concerned should guarantee for 20 years the service of interest and amortisation amounting to £70,000 per annum on a loan for £1,000,000, and they contend that the amount to be guaranteed by the Governments concerned is small and bears little relation to the sum which would be necessary if a railway were built. Messrs. Rendel, Palmer and Trittoru a very careful investigation oi the economic possibilities of a railway, estimated that 10 years after completioneomp3-0tion the railway earnings would suffice to cover all working expenses, provide £100,000 for amortisation and renewals, and pay on the capital expended on a 4* - 8-gr” railway 685 miles long connecting Haifa and Baghdad, 10c V/e return as requested the map and cross sections which accompanied your letter of the 22nd November, I have, &amp;c., (Signed) E.

C0I-IFID33TIAL. t??.pw^TCC NO.C?/380/35, 6th February, 1936. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your predecessor’s despatch Confidential (2) of the 21st November, 1935, .on the subject of the proposals submitted by the Palestine Corporation limited for the construction of a road from Haifa to Baghdad, and to inform you tha^ after consultation with my advisers and the Air Officer Commanding, Palestine and Trans-Jordan, I have reached the following conclusions. 2. I feel some doubt as to whether the grant of a monopoly on the lines proposed by the Palestine Corporation might not be considered as discrimination in favour of a British or Palestinian Company contrary to the terms of Article 18 of the Mandate and I am, in any case, opposed in principle to a monopoly of the sole existing means of transport. Moreover, from information which I have received from Mr.Gumbley, who is familiar with conditions in Iraq., I think it doubtful whether the Iraqi Government would be favourably disposed towards such a monopoly* they have indeed, I am informed, already begun on their own account the construction of a road running westward from Rsmadi. THE RIGHT HONOURABLE J. H. THOMAS, M.P. , HIS MAJESTY’S PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.-2- 7V* I apprehend that one result of granting a monopoly would be the charging of monopoly prices and I consider that the imposition of mononoly charges on the Haifa - Baghdad road would be self-defeating because traffic would thereby be forced on to the shorter and naturally easier Syrian route. I would add that, in nractice 3 the effective control of independent traffic for the purpose of collecting any toll or licence fees that might be imposed by the concessionary company would be a matter of serious difficulty, and apart from any general discontent which might be caused by the existence of the monopoly, special difficulties must be anticipated in connection with traffic between ^-yria and Iraq which, east of Rutbah, follows the same route as the Palestine - Trans-Jordan - Iraq trans desert traffic. 3. Turning to the political aspect of the proposol, I agree with the view expressed in paragraph 4 of your predecessor’s despatch that the present composition of the Board of Directors is unlikely to commend itself to the Iraqi and Trans-Jordan Governments. The British Resident, Trans-Jordan, has mentioned the proposal on general lines to the Amir and although His Highness did not raise any objection in principle provided that the public were not d^barr^d from using desert routes other than the roc;d operated by the Company, it must be borne in mind that the British Resident did not communicate the composition of the Board of Directors to the Amir and His Higness’s a.titude might well have been different had he been aware that the Company was of Jewish composition.-3- It might* of course, be possible partly to overcome this difficulty by altering the composition of the Company in such a manner as to include non- Jew ish members and capital. 4. With regard to the economic advantage of the scheme* it is possible that Palestine might derive some benefit in the form of increased trade and an additional outlet for some of her manufactures* but* on the other hand* the operation of this highway would seem likely adversely to affect the traffic on the Palestine and Trans-Jordan sections of the Hejaz Railway which are administered by the Palestine Railways. In any case I do not consider that the benefits to be derived would justify the Government of Palestine in incurring any expenditure or liability over and above that to which it is already committed in respect of the Jisr Majami - Ilafrak road. Trans-Jordan is not in a -position to assume any financial liability in connection with the construction or operation of the road. 5. It will be realised* in the light of the facts set out in the preceding paragraph* that the principal value of the proposed highway would be strategic. The existence of a good road would be of undoubted value from this point of view and the existence of vehicles of a known capacity as envisaged in the Company* s proposals would be of great value to the Imperial Forces in an emergency. The strategic value of the scheme is* however* primarily the concern of His Majesty’s Government and I feel that if any expenditure is to be incurred* or any financial guarantee given* in resoect of the Palestine and Trans-Jordansections of the prooosecl road* the burden should not be borne by Palestine or Trans-Jordan. 6. V/ith regard to the financial proposals set out in the letter of the 14th October, 1935, from the Palestine Corporation Limited, and the .Appendices thereto, which formed the enclosures in your predecessor’s despatch, I consider that the information given requires amnlification in many respects before any agreement could be entered into and I am also of the opinion that if a guarantee is given it should be for an initial period of say seven to ten years only, and not for so long a period as twenty years. Any guarantee which is given to the Company should, in my opinion, only cover the capital expenditure on the construction of the road and should not include the cost of vehicles or other equipment required for the operation of the scheme. I would also suggest that the guarantee should include a proviso that it will lanse in the event of the Company diverting its traffic to Syria, which might occur if the Syrian Government were to construct a highway from Syria to the Irapi boundary. 7. In conclusion, I am opposed in principle to the grant of a monopoly of traffic on the proposed road and I think the friction created by the grant of such a mononoly \ ould increase the inherent difficulties of operating the scheme to such an extent as to make it unworkable. I would also suggest that the Corporation’s figure, should be treated with considerable reserve. As an example of the presence of under-estimation I would draw attention to the fact that the Company propose to ■provide LP.7,000 per annum only for the maintenance of the entire road where as the estimate submitted by the Departments of Publica VWorks of Palestine and Trans-Jordan for the maintenance of a trans-desert road up to the Iraqi frontier is LP. 23,000 .^er annum.

CONFIDENTIAL Chief secretary*s Office, Jerusalem 13th February, 1936* Palestine, My dear Williams, Please refer to the High Commissioner^ Confidential despatch of the 6th February, on the subject of the proposals submitted by the Palestine Corporation, Limited, for the construction of a road from Haifa to Baghdad, consulted Gumbley who has, as you know, had considerable experience of conditions in Iraq and takes a keen interest in the question of communication between that country and Palestine. In addition to giving Valuable advice on the proposals under discussion he suggested a possible strategic alternative, and, although the High Commissioner did not think that the time had come for the official submission of alternative proposals, you would perhaps like to have Gumbley’s alternative before you for consideration if the construction of an all- weather road proves to be impracticable, I feel that I cannot do better than quote from the record of Gumbley’s views on our file as follows: U A road would only be necessary if it were desired to use the conventional type of motor vehicle which has been developed for use primarily in countries where roads already exist. Such vehicles operate at comparatively high speeds at an approximate cost of 9 pence a ton mile. There are already in existence When this question was under discussion I special 0 • G • R . WILLIAMS , ESQ C • M • G &lt;*special vehicles designed to operate across country with loads of 15 tons at a demonstrated cost of 3*7 pence per ton mile including depreciation and return journeys with partial load only. The axle loads on such vehicles are comparable with those of a thirty hundredweight Ford. There is als© on paper a thirty ton unit designed for the same axle loads f the operating cost of which is estimated to be under 2 pence per ton mile. In comparing costs, however, the factor of speed must be considered. Y/ith the vehicles which I have in mind the maximum speed is 28 miles an hour and the sound operating speed probably about 20* The construction of a road could not be economically justified unless a very dense traffic is foreseen and even from a strategic point of view I think it might be better to try to introduce the type of vehicle referred to above because a road is so much more vulnerable than the open desert.” The papers to which Gumbley refers are a letter dated the 30th September, 1935, which he addressed to me shortly after his returrt from leave, and a Report on Tests in Australia of Second 15-ton Motor Transport Unit; published by the Oversea Mechanical Transport Directing gonuni ttee, of King’s Buildings, Dean Stanley Street, London, S.V/.l. I enclose a copy of Gumbley’s letter but I am afraid that we have no spare copy of the printed Report. Perhaps you could get a copy from the Committee? Yours ever, (Signed) j # Hathorn Hall.ZHTi 150th September, 1935. Chief Secretary* Y/hilst at home on leave I paid my customary visit to the Overseas Mechanical Transport Directing Committee and was disappointed to find that no progress had been made with the thirty ton unit, chiefly because of lack of funds. Knowing that the Officer Administering the Government was Interested in the possibility, of using such a unit as a Connecting link between the Port and Railway system at Haifa on the one side and the Iraq. Railways at Baghdad on the other, I ventured to mention the subject to Mr. Y/illiams at the Colonial Office. The position is that approximately £25,000 is necessary to complete the design and manufacture of the 30 ton unit,, conduct the necessary tests in England, transport to Haifa, and six months running between Haifa and Baghdad under expert supervision. Any sums earned during operation to be credited to the authorities providing the above sum of £P»25,000. I do not know the figures for freight crossing the desert between Iraq, and the Mediterranean Ports but some 30,000 passengers crossed last year. I would, therefore, urge that there is a case for diverting to Palestine as much of this traffic as.possible by the provision of suitable equipment. If the Officer Administering the Government is prepared to recommend that the experiment be made I would suggest that it be financedby advance6 of £10,000 from the Government of Palestine 10,000 from the Colonial Development Fund 5,000 from the War Office, When the unit is sold to an approved operator the sum received v/ould 'be divided between the above contributors, (Signed) D, Gumbley* Director Civil Aviation,</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000602.0x00018a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2852</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x00018a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2852</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 17/7(2) 'Iraq and Palestine: agreement for transit through Palestine of goods to and from Iraq; Baghdad-Haifa railway'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1936/1936</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-09-06T22:38:15</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (246 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in rough chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 247; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
