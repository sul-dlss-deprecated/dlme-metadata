Their requests were not granted and they were sent under armed escort to their respective territories, where some of them were fined and others were sent to jail* The inhabi tants of Hunza and Magar say that they petitioned the Political Agent, G-ilgit because they considered him to be their *King w • These offences iiave given rise to discon tent amongst the people who now state that they wish that either the Russians or Chinese would establish their rule over Hunza and Nagar. As a result the inhabitants are spreading propaganda ol the possibility of arrival of Russians or Chinese soldiers, and exaggerated reports as to the number of Aeroplanes seen over Hunza, Nagar and Chalt are being broadcast. All these reports are false with the exception of that which states that one Aeroplane reconnoitered the landing ground at Pasoo and returned via Shamshal. The Mirs of Hunza also spreads some of these reports with the idea of obtaining some advantage from the G-overnment.&amp; By Air i-ail .

Two further reports about aircraft have since been received. The Mir of Hunza reports that on the 13th March at 2 p.m. several people in village Gulmit (Map 42.L. D 2) saw three aeroplanes which came from the Hunza Nullah direction (presumably Baltit) and after circling over N.zioicibcio near Gulmit returned the way they had come. 2. Nine men of Mamushading a hamlet of village Cha.Lt (L/ p 42 L.B.3) in Nagar Ctate affirm that between 6 and / p.m* on the same day first two and then 6 aeroplanes appeared in the sky above the mountain (Shot 1 tar) opposite Cha.lt from the direction of Ba.grote a.t a heigilt of '‘bout 1 1000 feet (10000 feet above the village). They were ilying high ana no distinguishing marks were visible but two seemed to be whioe when the sunlight caught them. The first two flew up the Budalas Nullah and the others in formation pairs behind each other, flew up the Hunza valley. 3. The factors in favour of the reports being true are ■aJ The Assistant Political Agent has been to i/amushading and recorded the statements of the nine witnesses on oath. There is nothing contradictory in their statements. One of the witnesses is a Haji who has often seen aeroplanes before.

Ii the report iron Che.It is true then probably the report from Gulmit is some confirmation. Villagers are notoriously vague rbout times and at least there are two reports about aircraft on the same afternoon. c. The river is noisy at both places so that the aircraft might not be heard or seen at thaf height by any who did not happen to be star gazing. d. A new bridge is being built over the Budalas Nullah instead of the Chalt bridge washed away last year. In Cinkiang it may perhaps have been reported that a new road to the Kintaka is being made (which it is not). e. It was a perfectly fine ana clear aay * 4. The factors against the reports being true are a. To undertake a flight of this kind (without weather reports) late in the afternoon would be a risky proceeding. b. Although there are believed to be landing grounds at Turghan bhehr (Map Ccale 1/100,000 42.3.D opposite Tnshkurghan) and Murghabi (Map 42.2.B) it is not known here whether there is any large aerodrome within range from which so many aeroplanes might have come. Chalt is 65 miles as the crow flies to the nearest point on the Russian frontier (across Wakhan (Afghanistan)). c. It seems highly improbable that eight aircraft would be sent for reconnaissance; and it is understood that no useful reconnaissance or aerial photography could be done at 17000 feet. d. The aircraft are not reported to have been seen from Bagrote or anywhere in the Gilgit CuofftTvision nor from anywhere in Nr:.gar except Mamuahacling (but see--iZJ see para. 3c).

These reports have not been sent on to the Political Agent because they were known not to be true. Although there is just a possibility that The present reports may be true if (vide para. 4.b) there are any aircraft with this range stationed near enough to the irontier to do the flight I am inclined to think that they are incorrect ana Tint the people of Hunza are suffering from a form of f Russian aircraftitis ! some tiling like one ’Russian iroopitis 1 which was prevalen in England at the oeginning of the 'tar. The original report of an aeroplane over Pa.su contained in my confidential Express Letter D 853/38, datea the 17th February 1938 is still generally believed to be correct and may have been the inspiration for the later reports.- Whether the report contained in my confidential'Express Letter P 30/P, dated the 7th March 1938 is equally reliable It is impossible to say.

On both occasions the aircraft cams from the direction of Smkiang, and as it has been established tb-^t they did notnot come from Afghanistan, vide the first enclosure to this letter, they must have 'been either Russian or Sinkiang Provincial aircraft. seems Probable that these aircraft visited the Gilgit Agency for reconnaissance purposes as a result of reports received by the local authorities regarding the concentration of troops or hostile bodies on our side of the frontier, vide telegrams from His Majesty’s Consul I^IM General, Kashgar, Hos . 42 and 61 dated the 1st Fare h 1938, and the 23rd March 1938, copies of which were forwarded to the India Office with my weekly letters Nos.3C(A)K, dated the 11th March 1938 and 43(A)M, dated the 30th March 1938.

The Government of India are of opinion that it is necessary to Protest regarding these violations of the frontier. On a previous occasion a protest was made by Eis aajesty f s ^Embassy in Moscow regarding a similar violation, responsibility/which the Russians denied, vide correspondence ending with P' Pers received with the India Office weekly 5to37. lette^To._32_, dated the 12th August 1937. The Government of India in recommending this protest, vide their letter ^hi No.F.162-7/3 6, dated the 6th January 1937, did not take into consideration the fact that the violation might have been committed by aircraft belonging to the Sinkiang Provincial Government, who it is understood possess a considerable number. On the present occasion the information regarding the colour and markings of the aircraft is so vague that it id impossible to say whether they belong to the- fthe Russians or the •Sinkiang .Provincial Government. All that is known is that they crossed the border from the direction of Sinkiang. Jhe Government of India therefore Propose to o.sk His Majesty's Consul General, Kashgar, to note to the local authorities complaining of the '“ nd askin g that enquiries may be made regarding the circumstances in which they took place, and that he Itay be informed of the results.

The Mir of Hunza reports that on the 6th March 1938, two aeroplanes were seen over Misgar at 9.45 a.m. They ax rived from the direction of the Min taka Pass and went away over the Chapursan valley (west of Misgar). Thev did not circle round at all and were only flying at about the height of the surrounding mountains (about 12C0G feet). Two men and one woman saw the machines which were b?,ack and ’not very noisy'. The Mir considers the report reliable. 2- This information ^ead with that supplied in my Express Letter N 0 .P.853/38, dated the 17th February 1938 seems to justify a vigorous protest. 3.

This Note stated that Provincial Government had reliable information that there was a gathering of more than one thousand mounted bandits in India not far from borders of Khotan District. These bandits were under leadership of n Ho-Pan-Ni n (presumably Q,urbanu Q,urbanullah Khan see Intelligence Report No.3/SIN/37/1829-30, dated February 10th 1937) Ma-Hu-Shan and Mahmud and it was rumoured to invade Sinkiang during March. Note further stated that if and when these bandits invaded Sinkiang the Provincial Government would hold Great Britain (sic) entirely responsible. 3. In reply I pointed out that although I had had no recent information from Khotan area these persons had by now left India, that Indian authorities did not allow any one to travel towards Sinkiang who had not a Chinese visa and that for these reasons I considered report unlikely. Administrative Commissioner showed no interest in my reply and appeared to consider his duty done with delivery of Note. 4 # While it is possible that this Note may be an indirect reply to protests I have recently been instructed to send to Urumchi (please see your telegram No.134 of 1937 and/I 2 .

I regret that this report has been somewhat delayed owin, 0 go effoi gs to obtain as much information as possible ana to ensure that it is accurate, 2. Tbe following information has been received from trie Mir of Hunza. The aeroplane appeared over Hunza tern- oory at rasu (Map 42-L.D.3) on the 9th February 1936 in the afuernoon. It came over the mountains from the north and after circling over Pasu at a height 'below the tops of the mountains (which a±e about 12,000) disappeared via the Siiingsnal nullah (east). It was seen by eight men all of wnoue have seen an aeroplane before (when the Air Marshal flew to Mintaka in 1936) and they reported that it was wmte m the middle and black on the sides'. The day was clear and as the mountain tops are not more than 4500 feet above Pasu it is unlikely that they can have made any mis- tc.i.e -oout it. It is not stated in this version whether the aeroplane was noiseless or not. 5 * As the c °™try north and east of Pasu is mountanous and sparsely populated there is little possibility of ob~ 3 ' taming any further confirmation from other places on the g ' Alne of f tight; and the original source of all reports from asu is probably the same. The Mir reports that the Chinese re making a new landing ground at Turghan Shehr opposite ashkurghan (Map 42-{j A.I&gt; which via the Shingshal nullah is isi 1 ' Hr-I S) is aocuo 100 miles from Fasu. Tlie Consul G-eneral Kasiigar may oe a,ole to verify whetner any machine (Russian?) answering go tne description given has been observed in Sinkiang. Ii a protest is made it will probably be denied as on a former occasion; out there seems no good reason to doubt the report which is believed to be reliable. It is even possible that the aeroplane was sent to spy ± out the land as regards ^tne proposed new landing ground at Pasu. But that project has jnot pet been sanctioned so that there was nothing to be seen nthere.41 ^ From . . * . o Tele^rcxiia XX. s No. 41 s dated 10th March 1938* . . .

In their Note No. 142 the British Embassy stated that, according to information received from the Government of India, in August of last year foreign aircraft were observed on two occasions over the territory of the Indian State of Kunza, and that in view of the peculiar geographical con ditions these machines could only have been operating from a base in soviet Central Asia. On the basis of this information enquiries were made of the competent Soviet authorities by the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, and from these enquiries it transpires that such violation of the Indian frontier by soviet aeroplanes did not take place.

X Dear RumDold, We are sending you officially copy of a rather tiresome despatch from Moscow about alleged violations of the Indian frontier by Soviet aircraft. We are inclined to feel that it matters very little how much confirmation of these flights we can produce for the Soviet authorities, as they will deny them in any case, and that the object of the Government of India - to show the Soviet Government that their proceedings in this area are not unobserved - can be achieved by action on the lines suggested by them and that the sooner this action is taken, the sooner may we expect that Soviet activities c ,in this matter will be modified. Unless therefore you want to try to collect more 'details from India, we would propose to reply to Moscow on the above lines. I shall be glad to know your views as soon as possible 4 r&gt;Oi uj cr * a i i &gt; r I * H.A.P. Rumbold, Esq. 15APR193Z) | ipiA OF FICE IMo. 169 (202/2/57) BRITISH m^kOBY 9 j I i J J / j TTr*^ o“¥'‘. 6 th April, 1957 Sir, In your despatch No. 126 (ii 1245/280/97) of the 12 th March you instructed Lord Chile ton to mke represent ations to the Soviet Government * should he see no objection, in regard to certain reported violations of the Indian frontier by Soviet aircraft. 2. Before taking action in this sense, I venture to put before you the following considerations. It would of course be quite possible to address a note to the Soviet Government, merely stating briefly that aircraft, believed to be Soviet, were seen over Kunza State early last August, and expressing the hope that further violations would not occur. ut the Soviet Government would almost certainly reply by requesting further details in support of this very vague allegation, and no details which could be regarded as at all adequate or satisfactory could in fact be supplied. Paragraph 5 of the letter of the 50th October, 1956 from the Political Agent at Gilglt gives a number of reasons for regarding the reports relating to the Hunza flight or flights as of doubtful value, to say the least of it, a© the basis of any definite statement that violations had actually been made by Soviet aircraft. It would evidently be impossible to represent the desirability /of The Eight Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., e tc., etc., etc&amp; of preventing farther violations if any doubt were implicit in the communication to the Soviet Government that the violations in the past were established facta and were undoubtedly carried out by Soviet aircraft. On the available data we could not farniah the Soviet Government with an exact date, nor say for certain how many aircraft were seen, nor what their markings were. The Soviet Govern ent could scarcely fail in these circumstances to point out the impossibility of investigating, with such inadequate data, cases which are alleged in any case to have occurred the best part of a year «go. The object of the Govern ent of India is, I realise, to insure that w the Soviet Government may be aware that their proceedings in this remote area do not pass entirely unobserved.” X feel, however, that the only impression likely to be made on them by correspondence of the nature suggested above, necessarily indefinite a© to our part in it, would be that they had successfully rebutted an unsubstantiated charge, and that if we could produce no better evidence of Soviet flights over remote districts, such flights could be repeated without serious risk of international complications. 3 . X should oe grateful if X might be informed wnether, in the light of the foregoing consideration©, you still wish me to approach the hoviet Govern ent in this matter. In view of the lapse of time the factor of urgency doe© not seem to exist and, if any eventual communication to the Soviet Government gains in force or precision as the result of further consideration by the India Office, the consequential ■ /delaydelay will have been more than outweighed. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect. Sir, . Your most obedient, humble servant.*■&gt; (Copy to Peking and Kabul) 3*) *+- , **n***rmrjHnr\ w*.*t f 7, yWi \ gONPIDaCTr^r. , v.

(a) Reports of an aeroplane seen over Chitral in July * .. . This was almost certainlybhe German aeroplane which)at that time reconnoitred the Pamirs. H.M.’s Minister, Kabul, raised the matter with the Afghan Government, who have expressed their regretjcwlthe Government of India do not consider it necessary to carry the matter further. (b) Two separate reports of two aeroplanes seen in different places in Hunza early in August. The Government of India regard the Hunza reports as well substantiated, and believe that the machines must have been Russian. This would be quite possible as the Russians have a landing ground at Kizil Robat, well v/ithin a 100 miles of where the aircraft were seen, and the Afghan Government have had previous cause to complain regarding the violation of their frontier by Soviet aircraft at the western end of the V/akhan. The Government of India suggest a protest to the Soviet Government in order that Tfe-hey may be aware that their proceedings in the Karakoram are observed. There is, however, an element of doubt regarding the Hunza reports, and, while it seems desirable to say something to the Russians in order to make them more leaoa WVV careful in the future, it would seem best to fyrvOoasSft-kiK v.w 'C\o%tov^ &amp;Csc\Vilov\» vCv vvcMycV TCAcy vU_ Ws cC^^xcVv.

The Government of India are oi opinion that one one foreign aeroplane reported as having been seen over Ohitral territory and Wakhan in July 1^56, was probably one aerman aeroplane which flew to Wakhan on or about the 19th July 1936 (v ide Express letter from His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, No. 244, dated the 22nd August 1936, copy sent to the India office with Foreign Secretary’s weekly letter No. 168 r i.., dated the 10th September 1936). His Majesty’s Minister nas already taken up with the Afghan Government the question of the violation of the Ohitral border by this aeroplane (vide his memorandum No. 244, dated the 23rd October 1936, a copy of which was forwarded under cover of Foreign Secretary’s /.v* 1 *3 {VV * 'WeeklyWeekly letter Mo. 206-M., dated the oth November 1936) and no further action regarding it appears necessary. 3. The Government of India are of opinion that the flight over Hunza in August 1936, which appears to be well- substantiated, can only have been carried out by a Russian aeroplane. His Majesty^ Minister, Kabul, who has been consulted, has given it as his opinion that no Afghan aeroplane could have performed the flight and no foreign aircraft is known to have been in Afghanistan at that time. The flight therefore can only have been made from a base in Russian or Chinese Turkistan and as far as is known there is no aircraft operating in this area which is not Russian. His Majesty f s Government are therefore being informed of the matter so tnat if they consider it desirable they can bring it to the notice of the Soviet Government. It seems to the Government of India that a protest should be made if only in order that the Soviet Government may be aware that their proceedings in this remote area do not pass entirely unobserved. 4. It is interesting to note that according to information received from His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, the Afghan Government have recently had occasion to make several protests regarding violations of their northern border by Soviet aircraft. The Soviet authorities denied the violations and suggested that the Afghan Government should send an expert witness to the border to report. The Afghan Government took action accordingly and not unnaturally no further violation was witnessed* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, &lt;9 ^ iCopy of memorandum No.D»701-C/36, dated Srinagar, the 19th November 1936, from the Resident in Kashmir, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, New Delhi.

I agree with the Political Agent that the evidence is sufficient to pursue the matter further.Secr et. Copy of letter No. 144-S of 1936, dated Gilgit, the 30th October 1936, from the Political ngent, Gilgit, to the Assistant to the Resident in Kashmir, Srinagar. Foreign axid: aircraft flying over the Gilgit Agency. I have the honour to refer to your endorsement No. D.597-0/36, dated the 30th September 1936, on the above mentioned subject. 2. It has now been possible to collate the various reports and in view of the importance of the subject they have been examined in detail. It will be convenient to refer to the 1/1,000,000 map as well as to the quarter inch sheets. The first report of foreign aircraft flying in this Agency was received by the Governor of Ishkoman on July 29th 1936. He was informed by some Wakhis that early in July one machine entered Wakhan from the direction of the Baroghil |i Pass, flew from Sarhad-i-Wakhan towards the Taghdambash Pamirs and returned the same way. On August 7th 1936, a report was received from the Governor of Yasin that about the middle of July one machine came from the direction of Badakhshan and flew over Wakhan and the Pamirs and returned the same way. It is reported to have been seen by ’‘all the people of Wakhan and the Pamirs’*. On August 11th 1936, a report was received from the Mir of Hunza to the effect that on August 9th four men who were sitting on the roof of their house at Kamaresh, one mile west of Gulmit (Map 42 L square 3/D) saw two machines flying low from the direction of the Gulmit Nullah. They disappeared in the direction of Gulkhin, a mile and a half north of Gulmit. The time was a little before sunset. The following day a man found a skein of thread and a parcel in his garden at Gulmit. The third day, August 11th, yet another man saw tv/o aircraft in the same place and flying in the same direction i.e. towards Gulkhin. A week before these events two men of Mayunj (H i- A Oq/j-a-xA 3 /s&gt; ^ to I'aJLcntrf' ^ ML*. ^/Nullah when they saw two aircraft flying at a great height towards Baltit(Hunza). The Mir states that both these men have seen aircraft on previous occasions both at Gilgit and when a flight was made over Baltit in 1932. The Mir states that4. that he was so surprised that he called ail the witnesses into iis Baltit and cross examined tnem and is satisfied that aircraft were seen. He thinks they must have come from Murghahi (Pamirski Post). 3. The accounts of the Governors of Ishkoman and Yasin do not reveal any glaring discrepancies but such is not the case with the Hunza report. On the first occasion aircraft were seen just before sunset. Prom whatever place they might have come it was late to be in so inhospitable a spot as Gulmit at that hour. Moreover it would appear that they were seen, twice in three consecutive days near Gulmit which is also unlikely. Nor is it really clear that they were seen in the second week in August. The reports were ma.de with a rapidity which is unusual among Wakhis, the inhabitants of Gulmit. Another remarkable feature of the Hunza report is that although I had careful enquiries made nobody saw any aircraft further north particularly at Misgar where not only is there a considerable population but a Telegraph Office with two Hindu opera,.tors. Whether the aircraft came from Murghabi of Kizil Habat or Khorog they would have to fly at a great height to reach Gulmit and the most obvious route, if Misgar is excluded, would be f rom G a khan down the Chapursan Nullah to Gulmit or over the most formidable country from the north west to Mayun. Despite these discrepancies we must give considerable weight to the Mir's opinion and to that of the two men of Mayun who twice before have seen aircraft. Opinion becomes further hardened when it is remembered that in the course of a fortnight reports of aerial activity came from three different sources; namely Hunza, Yasin and Ishkoman. The things said to have been dropped are curious. I enclose them with this letter for further examination. The article wrapped in a sort of oiled silk might be anything from a yak's tail to a v/rapper for a letter. I have secret information from a source usually considered reliable that these articles formed only part of a larger parcel and that most of the contents have been retained by a the Mir or the villagers and only these bits surrendered to create the proper impression. The only defect in this source is that it is inclined to be inimical to the Mir of Hunza.4. It remains to consider the possible places from which these aircraft might have started and their objective,, Khorog is known to possess a wireless station and an aerodrome. M Murghabi is known to have a landing ground. It is reliably reported that aircraft do land and take off at Kizil Rabat* Approximate distances in a straight line are; from Khorog to Mayun 180 miles; from Khorog to Gulmit k00 miles: from Murghabi to either Mayun or G-ulmit 130 miles: from Kizil Rabat to Gulmit 70 miles and to Mayun 80 miles. But over the Hindu Kush and the Karakoram range a straight course would be out of the question. (liven a judicious use of the nullahs such as the Ghapursan it is not difficult to understand how Gulmit was reached but unless the aircraft had a very higji ceiling it is difficult to see how they made Mayun from which comes our most reliable report. On October 22nd a Talentia aircraft of the Royal Air Force flew from G-ilgit via the Hunza gorges to within a short distance of the Killik Pass, maintaining a height of seldom less than 17,000 feet. On this flight the formidable nature of the Karakorams as an effective barrier were vividly brought to one r s mind. At the same time the mere fact of this flight being accomplished in three hours and ten minutes lends colour to the view that foreign aircraft could and did penetrate into the very heart of the G-ilgit Agency. Assuming the Mir*s reports to be correct in substance despite the variations in detail it would seem probable from the fact of one flight reaching G-ulmit a few miles north-east of Baltit and the other Mayun a few miles west-south-west of Baltit, that the Hunza capital was the objective. £&gt;. I am therefore of the opinion that foreign aircraft did fly over Chitral and the iik G-ilgit Agency, probably on two occasions, once in the middle of July over Chitral and the north of this Agency and once in the beginning of August into Hunza territory. I consider the evidence is sufficient to warrant the matter being pursued further.Confidential No.D-7143 -1/36 .

The obiect of this reconnaissance was confined to determining kJ the suitability of the route as an air approach of Sinkiang. 2. As a result of the Flight, it can be definitely stated that in fine weather the route provides no particular diificultcei to aircraft capable of maintaining a minimum altitude of 16,021 feet. It would, ho y/ ever, be undesirable for any aircraft to a11enpt this route with less than a working oeiling of 18,000 feet. The practicability of the route naturally depends entirely on we-tlier conditions and an attempt has been made by the heteoroiogical Authorities to produce an estimate of the number of days in the year on which flights by this route would be practicable. These figures only provide, however, bare approximations of the probable number of days on which the route can be safely navigated under the 1 ov/est cloud layer. It might often be quite possible to navigate the route over the clouds, provided visibility above the clouds was good and pro vided the aircraft could maintain the necessary altitude. It Y/ould not be practicable to navigate the route, or any portion of the route, in clouds. G-ocd visibility at the altitude at which the aircraft is flying v/ould be essential. It is estimate A that in the seven months betv/een November and May the route would be impassable 130 days out of 212. In the five months between June and October, the route might be expected to be irn assable about 30 days out of 153. One would therefore expect to be able to fly to Kashgar on about 60 2 of the days in a year. ¥ith aircraft capable of maintaining an altitude of 20,000 feet or more, piloted by men familiar with the country the number of days on Y/hich flights to Kashgar might be successfully completed wnul-d. be considerably increased.'V ^’C 3. Although parts of the route pass ever extremely rugged and precipitous country, including two narrow gorges - one between G-ulmit and Altit and the other south of Khaibcr - and several others - notably that lying between Chalt and Nona there are places here and there in thev alleys where it might be possible to make landing grounds. The best and most conveniently situated of these is at Sost at an altitude of over 9,Off' feet. A landing ground at this place would be of partifular value as a refuelling ground for aircraft flying to, or operating over, Sinkiang. It might also be possible to make landing grounds at Pasu, Nagir and Chalt. Furthermore, the Chapursan Valley is open, relatively broad and flat and, though it was not reconnoitred, it appeared to offer possibilities for landing grounds. If, however, it proves practicable to make a ground at Cost, nothing more would be required in that neighbourhood. 4* Cn the return journey, the Babusar Pass and Kaghan Valley were reconnoitred. This route offers a convenient and practicable short cut to G-ilgit via Hazara country. From the flying point of view, this route is, in fine weather, preferable to the Indus gorges since it is shorter and offers no greater difficulties from a landing point of vie?/ than the Indus and has the advantage of avoiding tribal territory. Cn the other hand, the Indus route can be navigated at relatively lew altitude whereas an altitude of at least 14,000 feet is required to cross the Babusar Pass. 'Vith a cloud layer under 14,000 feet, the Kaghan Valley route would be impracticable to aircraft other than' those flying above the clouds. The general level of the mountains in tho Kaghan district is a fairly uniform 15,000 feet to 16,000 feet and only one mountain rises above this general level to nearly 18,000 feet. The fop end of the Kunhar Paver, where th valley runs east and west, seemed to offer the best prospects for the construction of ^landing ground. Sc far as could be seen, it is unlikely that landing grounds could be made elsewhere/file 'tl Sascetu, Demi-official Uo. 244(«!). X %rW' y a ♦ 560 1937 oq ^ tM*?

It may be of interest to the Government of Inuia to know that when I was recently discussing idle movements of the German aeroplane with Sardar Naim Jan, he imormed me that the Afghan Government had recently had occasion to make several protests against violations of their northern border, near, I think, Ishkas lim, by Soviet aircraft. These reports were based on information received from the local people, and the Soviet authorities, after denying that any such violations had in fact taken place asked the Afghan Government to send some expert witness to the area to report. The Afghan Government, somewhat naively, did so, and the expert after remaining some considerable time in the north returned with the report that he had seen no violations, though he had seen Soviet aricraft in the air near the border. I should think it is quite possible that Soviet aircraft do at times cross into northern Qhitral or Gilgit. Yours sincerely, Sd/- W.K. Fraser-Tytler* To Major W.R.

I took up the question of the recent violation by the (xerraan aeroplane of the Ghitral border at a recent interview. I informed the Foreign Minister that I was not instructed to make a formal protest but that reports from Chitral were quite definite and showed tiiat on the two occasions the G-eiman aeroplane had approached the Indian border it had violated it. I hoped that the Afghan Government would issue rather more explicit instructions in future to the pilots of visiting aeroplanes. 3. Sardar Naim Jan said that their instructions had on this occasion been as explicit as it was possible to be. They had gone over the route with the German pilots on the map, had pointed out to them how very narrow the fakhan salient was, and asked them to take every care not to violate either the Chitral or the Soviet frontier. The pilots understood perfect ly well what the position mis, and Dr. Ziemke, the German Minister, had given an undertaking that no violations would take place. Sardar Haim Jan said he regretted the incident, and would do everything possible to ensure that it did not recur. At the same time he pointed out that with unskilled observers it was not always possible to tell exactly where an aeroplane was, especially when it was flying at 15 to 20,000 feet. I said I thought there was no doubt that on this occasion the border had been violated.r FILE CORVTT^rn J * , j 7Q/4 | Copy of fKxpreet) be t'Wr ’To .7/ 12 dated 1st -eto'ber 1936 fro a In t#lliganc« f ^to Foreign* Si ila * L— — 0.

There are local rumours in the Gilgit Agency that they had come from the Russian Post of Murghab in the Pamirs,where there is known to be a landing ground.

Deputy Director, Intelligence, Government of india, Peshawar.ff tz. cnqoj-^. ~) CONFIDENTIAL. \ Beport on visit of Air Marshal Sir Edgar Lndlow-Hewitt, K.C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., M.C., ^ Air Officer Commanding the Royal Air Force in India to Gilgit, October 21st to 24th 1936. The annual Royal Air Force Flight to Gilgit was notable this year for the first official visit of an Air Officer Command ing to the Agency. On a previous occasion in 1926, Air Chief Marshal Sir Edward Ellington, when commanding the Royal Air Force in India, visited the Agency unofficially and on foot. That visit was made with a view to selecting suitable landing grounds in the Agency. It marked the beginning of aeronautical development in the most remote outpost of the Indian Empire, a tract of country which ethnologically belongs to Central Asia, which com prises in a small compass the most formidable and mountainous country in the world and whose frontiers only ter minate where on the Roof of the World the dominions of Great Britain, Russia, China and the kingdom of Afghanistan meet. Since 1926 the Royal Air Force have established landing grounds at Chilas and Gilgit and have surveyed and ap proved a landing ground at Yasin. Until the present visit, however, the only reconnaissance to the north had been as far as Baltit, the Capital of Hunza, by two Hawker Harts in the autumn of 1932. The first visit of aircraft was by four Wapitis in 1929 and since then aircraft have visited the Agency on 21 separate occasions, all ex cept one being by the Royal'Air Force. As the development of air communi cations with Gilgit is a matter of importance I append to this Report a statement which shows the number of flights made to and in the Agency jup to date. 2. The Valentia piloted by Flight- Lieut. J. R. W. Whitley landed at Gilgit at 10-30 a.m. on October 21st. In addition to the Air Officer Com manding it carried Flight-Lieut. Begg and two airmen. Sir Edgar Ludlow- Hewitt was received by the Political Agent and British Officers. He then inspected a guard of honour of the Gilgit Scouts of 25 files under the com mand of Subedar-Major Mahboob Ali Uian, after which the Mirs, Chiefs and ■pmeials were presented. A procession, not lacking in the pic turesque, was formed for the ride into Gilgit. On arrival at the Gilgit Bridge a salute of 15 guns was fired. In the afternoon a garden party was held at Agency House to enable local officials as well as the Mirs and Chiefs to meet the visitors. The same night a dinner, at which the Mirs and Chiefs were present, was given by the Political Agent. 3. October 22nd. At about 7-15 a.m. the Valentia took off in perfect flying weather to make a reconnaissance to the north. Practically the whole route mav be seen on Map 42 L. The first eleven miles from Gilgit is on sheet 43 I and the one or two miles before the turnin 0, point on sheet 42-K. So that the load might be as light as possible the wireless operator was left behind and his place taken by the Political Agent. The flight took approximately o hours and 10 minutes. Taking the line of the Hunza river the Valentia S ?° n i flyin g close t0 Rakaposhi (25,550) which forms the western bas- tion of the Kailas (Himalaya) range. Shortly after passing Baltit, the Hunza t^apita! the Karakorams were penetra ted at the very narrow and precipitous gorge between Gulmit and Pasu. At is point great peaks, sometimes jagged, sometimes cone shaped and varymg f r ° m 2 0,000 to 25,000 feet stretched away to east and west as far as the eye at an elevation of approxi- jnately _ 17,200 feet, could see PP From that point to Misgar there was little land g hnt n th6 forhid( l in g nature of the startling .°' a PP roacI Mng Murkushi a The tr . a '^ ori n atl on was apparent., The labyrinth of unsealed and un named peaks, guarded by sombre gorges hills Z7 n the ^ rounded bosh pf . valle y a of the Taghdum- in Rq a , mir ?' ,? or the first time the w !% nely history* the Roof of the World awakened to the roar of great engines, though probably the only hving creatures to obserye this pheno- Marcn pT a f ew herds of tKe sheep of Marco Polo.

Somewhere in the western Karakoram range (probably in square 2/C Map 42- L) there is an outstanding peak smothered in snow save for a large gash of red on its flank which looked like granite. The Batura glacier apneared as a long straight road with the line of demarkation between glacier and rock plainly visible. At Baltit height was lost to drop a message on the Mir of Hunza. Although dropped at a height of about 7,000 feet from its objective it fell in a field by the Rani’s House. The Hispar glacier pre sented an unforgettable sight, suggest ing some celestial highway with the Golden Gates in the guise of a great lonely peak at the end. This was seen east south east from Baltit. From that place to K 2 in a dead straight line is one hundred miles. From Gulmarg (9,000) Nanga Parbat, 85 miles away, is visible so perhaps it was K 2 that was viewed from Baltit. At an elevation of 17,000 feet there is nothing very big in the way. The summit was certainly of the rounded shape to be observed in the rare photographs of this mountain. It is a pleasant and by no means im possible thought. At Chalt where the Hunza river bends to the south a very slight devia tion west of south was made to obtain a view of Naltar, the new summer sta tion. Far famed Chaprot proved a disappointment but the sister nullah, Naltar, stood out as a fine and well wooded glen with its forests of blue pine and silver fir stretching many miles to the north west. It was impossible not to feel some pleasure at the sight of the new house completed less than two months ago. On the return flight photographs were taken of likely landing grounds. Sost,^ 119 miles by the land route from Gilgit appeared to offer considerable possibilities as also did Pasu and to a lesser degree Misgar. On this most important matter the report of the Royal Air Force will be awaited with' deep interest. If the reconnaissance' results in a landing ground at Sost the political consequences will be of first importance. The loyalty of future Mirs will be bound even more strongl#^ to the British Government in a, tew them, most depressing manner for no longer will they have a back door for flight. The exit of which Safdar Ali availed himself in 1891 will be closed. If the old strategic barriers are break ing down under the development of aircraft then these valuable northern oases of plain must be denied for ever to an enemy and in what more simple manner than by occupying them our selves. Not for much longer will there be a strong man in Hunza and Little Guihal, but the problems of the future will be simplified if it is possible to transport troops into the heart of that State at short notice instead of by a weary and easilv opposable march that Jn the best conditions must take manv Giigit iigency be nearly interested : but tne Agency can never teei tnat it is without responsibility for the Consulate at Kashgar with its handful of Euro peans and its tiny Hunza guard If nelp were ever needed there it could only come from Gilgit and a landing ground at Sost would turn that chance of help, at present so remote, into some- •i ea r tile lan d route Sost is 524 miles from Kashgar so that a return flight without re-fuelling should be pos sible for many types of aircraft.

This short flight, a graceful and much ap- preciated act on the part of the Air Officer Commanding, was a very great It the butevent in the lives of several people. I give their names below:— Sir Muhammad Nazim Khan, ^ K.C.I.E., Mir of Hunza. Khan Bahadur Muhammad Anwar Khan, Governor of Punial. Khan Sahib Mir Baz Khan, Gover nor of Yasin. Khan Sahib Muhammad Rahim Kha, Governor of Kuh-Ghizar Raja Hussain Ali Khan, Governor of Ishkoman. Raja Jafar Khan of Gilgit. ; Subedar-Major Ghazan Khan, Hunza. Subedar-Major Mahboob Ali Khan Nagar. In the minds of nearly all apprehen sion was smothered by excitement and though I do not think the faineant Raja of Gilgit knew much about the beginning or the end, in the eyes of Gilgitis he is now a person of consequ ence and so, if they were not before, are Hie others in the eyes of their people. To write thus of a short journey by air may in these davs seem strange but not so to those who know the Gilgit Agency and its primitive, agricultural folk, lhat the political effects of the affair were excellent there is not the slightest doubt. In the afternoon there was a polo match, Punial versus the Scouts in which the former won by 9 goals to 6 after a spectacular game. Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt and Flight-Lieut. Begg then played for a side against the Chiefs. No other action of the visitors could have had such a happy effect at the close of a memorable day. 4, October 23rd was occupied mostly in a chikor shoot and fishing, the latter specially opened for one day. After dinner there was a Scouts dance. 5. On October 24th the Valentia left at 7-10 a.m. and after making the first flight ever attempted over Babusar reached Chaklala at 9-5 a.m. and Delhi at 2^p.m. This is even better than the flight of the Avro X last January and shows that an early breakfast in Gilgit and a late lunch in Delhi in, the course of one day is not impossible of accom plishment. Beyond doubt the annual flight this year was a notable event in the history of the Gilgit Agency. That the Air Officer Commanding should have found time to come himself is a matter of deep satisfaction. G.

Simla, LETTER, r\ / n U yuk Dated the 22hd August,' 1936. Your telegram 164 of 13th 0 Following coniments are subject to correction by experts. 2. Flight to Wakhan was probably made on 19th July. Course given in my despatch 106 was communicated to me by Foreign Minister and seems natural line to have followed. Machine had ceiling of only 20,000 feet and as German pilots were presumably expert navigators, it seems probable that they did not diverge from their course till after crossing Munjan pass. If as it appears from reports they then turned at right angles to cross Dorrah pass into Lutkoh valley, the only reason for their doing so would appear to be that they mistook this valley for Wakhan. It seems unlikely that they would otherwise have left route to easier country plains of Badakhshan for difficult valleys of northern Chitral. Air experts could not doubt say whether such mistake was likely. 3. As regards flight on 22nd. It appears from further enquiry that machine probably carried out a flight of about two hours duration, leaving Kabul at about 10 a.m. and flying east. This might perhaps have taken it over Chitral border into Bogosht Gul. 4 0 I have made no official enquiries on these points and presume that if matter is to be taken further a reference will be made to Berlin to which pilots have now returned.

Thus the foreign aeroplane 'white in colour' appears on 19th (possibly 18th) July to have flown down the Lutkuh valley as far as Shoghore, and on 22nd July to have come over Bagusht Dole and then up the Lutkuh valley.

Soon after the same day two aeroplanes of Koyajil Air Force came from Drosh to Chitral ana went back, therefore it is not certain whether the saia aeroplane was of R.A.F. or Foreign. ^ Qo mmuK L- , Extract from Chitral Sub-Agency Diary, for the week ending 26th July, 1936.

Extract from Gilgit Agency Diary for January, 1936. Visit of S i r Eric Teichman . - Reference is invited to paragraph 66 of this diary for the preceding month. Sir Eric arrived in Gilgit on January 9th and left hy air for Delhi on the 16th. His journey from Gilgit by an Avro X of Indian National Airways marks an important event in the history of the Agency as it was the first visit of civilian aircraft to Gilgit. Made in the depth of the winter when flying conditions at great heights can be very trying, it was accomplished with the minimum of trouble. The arrival of the Avro was delayed one day owing to the possibility of ice forming on its wings and while over the Black Mountain country on its outward flight it was apparently hit by a spent bullet. As the pilot never flew below 14,000 and as a stupid tribesman with a rifle would not be likely to climb to a height of more than 9,000 in the middle of the winter, or at any other time for that matter, the danger from such irresponsible action would seem to be extremely remote. The visit emphasised once more the need for a petrol dump in Gilgit. The pilot expressed surprise and pleasure at the condition of the aerodrome, the extension of which last September, must be regarded as providential in the light of the subsequent visit of this three engine monoplane and of the Valentia troop carrier. It is worthy of record, even in these days of spectacular flights, that Sir Eric breakfasted in Gilgit and dined the same day in Delhi. It may also be recorded that the visit of so distinguished an expert on far Eastern affairs constituted a very pleasant interlude in the daily life of the Agency, Prior to this there is no record of a visitor in Gilgit during the month of January.■I mm —AIR MINISTRY, ADASTRAL HOUSE, KINGSWAY, W.C.; 7th January, 1936. r®' 3|«.

R SCOMM’^lfDAT I0H3 . The following points arose in connection with this Flight and are put forward since the Area covered now comes directly under British control. FUEL SUPPLIES . (i) There is no petrol or oil supply at CHILAS or GILGIT. Aircraft making the flight can only carry a very small reserve load of extra petrol with which to carry out such reconnaissances as are required. There appears to be much country of which little is known and of which maps are inaccurate and a great deal of useful photographic survey might be carried out by aircraft if reserve petrol supplies were available at GILGIT. (ii ) Further were an aeroplane required to return on the homeward route to CHILAS or GILGIT through bad weather conditions in the 1HDU3 Gorge, it would be necessary to fly additional petrol up to that aircraft before it could return to its parent unit. Without this fuel supply no operation could be carried out over the GILGIT Area. LAUDING GROUBPS . CHIIAS. This aerodrome is very small and has a con siderable ridge across it which is not visible from the air. As this ridge is the cause of some danger to heavily loaded aircraft, it is suggested that it be levelled 1 as far as circumstances permit# To lengthen this aerodrome would require the deviation of a snail nullah. GILGIT . This aerodrome is excellent. It has been recently enlarged and there is ample space to operate all types of aircraft from it. GUPI3. A landing ground in this area would form an effective link between GILGIT and CHITRAL* Though no survey was made of tills area it would appear from the configuration of tile ground that no difficulty would be experienced in making one. COMMUNICATIONS . The use of normal two way w/t on such a. flight is valueless since ii is only possible to maintain Cignal touch with PESHAWAR or KOHAT for one half of the journey. It is suggested short wave w/T at GILGIT would not only serve the purpose of easy communication for * / ) ( /the Fllit&amp;ry and PoXltleel Authorities with a range covering GHlfR&amp;L* SXMIA, BHLHI end PS SHAW AH» but would afford © mesne for iUA.J*. Personnel to gain quick touch with parent station* It ie believed that m R«A # I* short Wave Pack set has already operated successfully between GILG1T and KARACHI. there are the necessary Post Office Jsployere already at GILGIT who have sufficient electrical knowledge to enable them to operate such a set after a little instruction* mujmmr * The two rolls of photographic films taken up with the flight were on development found to be •stale* and the photographs taken with considerable trouble and expense were therefore not worth printing* Though these films same up from the d*A.JP* Depot very recently it has been found necessary to return the whole batch as useless* The photographs taken were most valuable since they consisted largely of passes out of OHILa$I and j tmiAX* territory of which very little was known. It is suggested that if ordinary stocks of films are so unreliable that special provision be made for flights of this nature in the future* Ho maos of the Area Horth of ftft&amp;lf were available at KOKAf, nor apparently could they be supplied by So. 1 {Indian) Group* i^SGHA^AH* although they were asked for* A flight of this nature would be made more valuable by a careful study of maps before its commonca*aent, it is suggested that :iheets 42.H and 42.L be placed on 11 S3 ^ j^o* 1 (Indian) wing Movement Order ho* 16* With Equipment and Loading Table* Map showing Areas covered in reconnaissances* Jbel consumption figures.

What difference jthds will make to mankind’s awe of the^ heights will be an interesting topic for future generations. There is now, probably, no moun tain region in the world so com monly flown over as the Western ranges of the Himalayas, which encrust the North West Frontier of India. The Royal Air Force in India are mainly concentrated about their feet. Their business of train ing and their patrolling duties con stantly carry them in long flights over their peaks and valleys. Short of war, no service which our de fence forces have to perform is more dangerous. The whirling air currents about the tremendous mountain corridors and the clouds and mist which sometimes shroud their contours compel the aviator to take his life in his hands every time he wings his way over them. To none does Nature reveal more of her rich beauty than to our mountain fliers. A brief paragraph in the news papers a little while ago reported once more the annual flight of Ro yal Air Force machines from Risal- (FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.)

Rapidly ascending from the starting ground to a height of 10,000 feet, the five machines went north east to the Indus, and on reaching its silver stream they turned left hand to the north and followed the thread-like line for a hundred miles. By this time, the river was seen among tremendous gorges and bent in a gradual right-angled turn be tween tremendous mountain walls. Curving round accordingly, from Jalkot to Bandazasin, the fliers as they turned their faces east saw the valley opening out before and be low them like a fan. The aero planes had for many miles been flying with mountain ridges and peaks towering above them to the right and left, and with the morn ing sun slanting upon the heights and across the light white clouds which veiled many of their summits the views were exquisitely beauti ful. The atmosphere over the valley above Zasin was sparkling and clear and as the line of peaks opened out like a V there stood out, gleaming, on the right, the 26,629 feet high Nanga Parbat. The ecsta sies of admiration in which men have given it that name, which ported by a workmanlike body of irregular troops called the Gilgit Scouts. He is under the control of the Political Resident in Kashmir. There is a large landing ground at Gilgit. The local people delight to keep it in order, for they wel come the annual aeroplane visit as making a red letter day in their quiet year. The aviators were met on their descent by Major G. B. V. Gillan, the Political Agent, and by a great gathering of the coun try people. So eager were the hillmen to meet the visitors that a strong guard of the Kashmir State Force had to cordon off the land ing ground until the machines were down and their propellers stopped. The Mir of Nagar and his court were among the visitors specially come for the occasion. What ap peared most to interest them was that the aeroplanes were of a differ ent type from those used a year ago, a point which they were sharp to observe. PESHAWAR « pur,^ near Peshawar, to Gilgit, north means “the Nude Virgin”, were of Kashmir, and back. There is presumably engendered by distant probably no mountain flight in the world more beautiful than this. The flier goes past the poetically lovely slopes of Nanga Parbat and skims near the sublime, towering cliffs of Rakaposhi. And never twice is the wonderful scenery quite the same, for upon no landscape do the sea sons and the daily changes in atmos pheric conditions cast more be witching variety than upon the lofty hills. The flight this year was made a few weeks ago and was successfully and pleasantly performed by five Hart aircraft. These machines are biplanes specially designed for high speed and for bombing. They are therefore well able to take advan tage of brief spells of favourable weather and to carry without diffi culty the heavy loads of petrol required for flying considerable dis tances away from fresh fuel sup plies^ For some days men and machines kept themselves ready to start at a moment’s notice on I receipt of a satisfactory forecast 1 from the meteorological authorities f and when the desired news arrived early one morning up they went in a perfectly clear atmosphere and gentle breeze. views from the sunny south. The peak appears very beautiful from about Baramula, on the Jhelum road, a few miles from Srinagar. From over the valley of the Indus, to the north, the lady looks just as grand, but decidedly chilly and forbidding. ARRIVAL AT GILGIT Shortly after passing Chilas and the most striking view of Nanga Parbat, the aeroplanes, still follow ing the Indus, turned sharp left and thus once again faced due north. Over Bungi they sped serenely upon the last stage of their journey at 110 miles an hour. When shortly afterwards the Indus valley again turned right, the fliers bore slightly to the left up the valley of the Gilgit river and this, twenty minu tes later, brought them to the town of that name. Gilgit is a very important place. It is the natural centre of the rug ged country forming this section of the Indian frontier. Being part of Kashmir State, it is garrisoned by troops of His Highness the Maha rajah. Because of its importance in the general defence line of India and about the junction of two of A SHORT RESPITE By the time the machines were picketted down and unloaded and their guards set and arrangements made for men to stand by in case a sudden mountain storm should bear down in the evening, the day was far spent and officers and men set tled down for a restful evening. Next day was kept as a general bank holiday. The airmen had a holiday and made excursions in the neighbourhood. Major Gillan had a chikor drive for the officers. In the evening, the Gilgit Scouts gave a picturesque Scouts’ Dance and this was attended by every officer in the station and eagerly watched by a large gathering of people. Fine folk are these mountaineers, and most workmanlike in appearance are the Scouts recruited from their villages. From this same popula tion are drawn the powerful porters commonly seen in Simla during each segsgn there and commonly spoken of as Kashmiris. The next day there was a polo match. Every- body in the place, except merely the guard upon the aeroplanes, attended and the game was played with its traditional gusto which every one knows to characterise it m these parts. The following day saw the aero planes m the air again, this time to carry out exhibition flights over the surrounding country in two direction?!. Two i river over Baltit and gave the people of Hunza and Nagar a sight of themselves. Proceeding up the Hunza river valley, over Nomal and Chalt, at a height of 12,000 feet, the machines curved to the right round the gigantic slopes of Raka poshi. The mountain was a magni ficent sight. Rising steeply from I'b® r W® r b e( h which is approximate ly 6,000 feet, to its peak at 25,500 teet, with glaciers on its northern lace, giving vent to streams flow ing down to the Hunza river, it gave an impression of most impos ing grandeur. OVER NAGAR r4 +i Ver Haltit the fliers noticed little enthusiasm amongst the popu lation. _ But over Nagar they were entertained by the signs of inte 1 excitement below. As the aero planes arrived, flying low up the vahey, a saluting gun, which the Government of India recently gave to _ the Mir, was fired and went on being fired as quickly as the gun ners could load and reload it. All t e people of the place seemed to be gathered on their house tops to watch the planes and they signalled their welcome by waving their chogas and_ throwing their caps into the air. r bv^Lf^ ovei \? un ial was made Lino r’i^ -j 0116 - mac bme.

We believe in dis armament. We do not believe in fighting with swords or guns and our weapons are argument, persuasion and reasoning,” said General Hig gins, the head of the Salvation Army, in an interview last evening at Bapatla, the Society’s headquarters in the Andhra territory, when asked why the Salvationists called their organisation an army when their object was “service” to others. “We fight for right,” continued the General, “and ours is a fight for the banishment of ignorance and the dispelling of darkness. We fight against wrong, oppression and tyranny and our endeavour is to uplift the down-trodden. It is in this sense that we call our workers ‘soldiers” and our organisation an “army”. GOVERNMENT'S SINCERITY General Higgins refused to be drawn into any political discussion but he stated that he was convinced that the Government of Great Britain was anxious to do its best for India and its desire was to see the prosperity, advancement and true development of India. The present Government was sincere in its desire to help India and Premier MacDonald was one of India’s truest friends. The General hoped that there would be amiability and happiness in India and he wanted her to advance to the very bright future which she had before her. ‘I do not, however, think,” said the General “that she can get what she wants all at a time.” Asked whether he hoped to see Mr. Gandhi before he left India General Higgins stated that he was being asked about Mr. Gandhi where, ever he went, but he never had an occasion to speak to him. “I have seen him only once and that was in the Buckingham Palace when he was shaking hands with the King at the Royal reception to the Round Table Conference delegates. I then wish ed to speak to him but had no oppor tunity to do so. I am not, however, making any efforts to see him now, and I am not sure whether I ^ will meet him before I leave India,” Regarding the untouchability pro blem the General said: “You know I am their friend. Our work is mainly among the untouchables and we are entrusted with their advancement and progress. In my opinion, it would be more necessary to teach the depressed classes hygenic prin ciples and sanitation than impart higher education.” GOVERNOR CALCUTTA, December 29 . “For many years past the Govern ment of Bengal has been under a special debt to the Salvation Army for the work which the latter un dertakes in connection with the re clamation and reformation of our ‘criminal tribes.’ This work calls for just those gifts of patience, in sight and sympathy for which the Army is famous and it is this work which Government is able to entrust with an easy mind to the officers of the Army, who manage both settle ments for parents and industrial schools for children with the mini mum of Government interference,” said the Governor of Bengal, pre siding at a meeting in Grand Hotel. General Higgins spoke at the meet ing on the activities of the world wide “Salvation Army.” Hirala nullah. Here people turned out interest. visited sa w ^ 0U 1 tIyin ^ People thus W d TLo ae ?

It primarily covers three topics.The first topic is the matter of annual Royal Air Force (RAF) flights to Gilgit over the Himalayas in 1932, 1934, 1935, and 1936. It includes a report on the 1934 flight (see folios 132-141), a report on the 1935 flight (see folios 114-129), and a memorandum on proposals for the 1936 flight (see folios 106-107). A couple of sketch maps have been included to accompany these reports: see folios 104 and 117. Forty-five aerial photographic prints from the flight in November 1934 have also been included: see folios 159-203. Press excerpts of coverage of the first flight over the Himalayas in November 1932 can be found towards the back of the file: cuttings from

It also includes a report of the visit by Air Marshall Sir Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt to Gilgit between 21 and 24 October 1936: see folios 98-99.The second topic is reports of violations of the northern frontier of British India by foreign – mainly German and Russian – aircraft. Correspondence in the file documents investigations into these reports and subsequent action taken.The third topic is a reconnaissance of the Hunza Valley in 1937 to identify a site for a landing ground, the selection of Pasu, and the postponement of the project by the Government of India.The main correspondents are as follows: officials of the Foreign and Political Department of the Government of India (External Affairs Department from 1937), the Political Resident at Kashmir, the Political Agent at Gilgit, HM Consul General at Kashgar, and HM Minister at Kabul. Only occasional reference is made to the India Office in London.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Gilgit</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Kashmir</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Himalayas</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Gilgit</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Hunza</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Landing grounds</topic></subject><subject><topic>Aerial photographs</topic></subject><subject><topic>Hawker Hart (Bomber)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Air Force</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Aerial reconnaissance</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000213#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
