Oil Concessions on the frucial Coast. i / f - /,'V - // -./ ilcc/ 4 HR*COPY, © flj (fi' 24th May, 1937• To H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrain. Dear Sir, The following is my idea as to what my next move should be now that Dubai Concession has been concluded. Cl) I shall approach the Kuler of Has-al-Khaimah for Concession covering the State of Ras al Khaimah. The basis both as to terms and payments that I propose to discuss with the abovementioned Ruler will be almost identical with those to the Shaikh of Dubai. The question of the London Representative - with a similar solution - is almost certain to arise in connection with both the States of Ras-al-hhaimah and Sharjah, as the Shaikh of Dubai was in constant touch with both of the above Rulers during my negotiations with him. The area of the State of -ftas al Khaimah is second in size to Dubai. The order as regards area is, Dubai, Ras-al- Khaimah, Um-al-'%aiwain, Sharjah and Ajman.

To The Hon’hle the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject:- Encroachment of party of Geologists into Muscat territory. Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith for whatever action you may deem fit the translation of a letter received from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman in which he complains of the encroachment into Muscat territory of a party of 3-4- English Geologists accompanied by Sultan bin Zayid said to be one of the relatives of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. 2. The Buraimi District where the oil reconnaissance is said to have taken place is a large oasis on the edge of the desert country some 75 miles due west of Sohar. The exact boundaries here-abouts have never been properly defined but I understand Buraimi has always been claimed by Muscat and in fact does belong to the State even though as the Sultan * ^ plaintively remarked to me the inhabitants never pay Zakat. 3. No mention is made in the Sultan's letter o^ the date of the alleged reconnaissance at Buraimi but in a conversation I had today with His Highness he informed me that he understands it took place about one month ago. 4. As was expected with the coming of Oil Concession Companies boundary problems are certain to arise and I propose to take this opportunity of urging the Sultan for his own advantage to make an effort to define the land xLm limits of his State as early as possible though I am afraid that even this-- 2 -- s'C ^ this incentive will not be likely to accomplish anything for some time to come, vide paragraph 3 of my Express Letter No. 561 of 12th May. I ha^e the honour to be, Sir, Your moat obedient servant. major, Political Agent &amp; H.B.M’s Consul, MuscatTranslation of a letter dated the 8th Rabi Awwal 1356, corresponding to the 19th May 1937, from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat &amp; Oman, Muscat to the Political Agent &amp; H.B.M's Consul, Muscat. After compliments, V/e have informed you verbally that the Woli of Sohar has reported to us that one of the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi named Sultan bin Zayid arrived in the territory of Buraimi accompanied by three or four Englishmen representing a certain Oil company, with a view to making a research of the said territory. As you are aware Buraimi is within the boundaries of Oman and the Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi have no right to interfere. We would therefore request that you will make verification into the matter through the Hon'ble the Political Resident. There is no doubt that such a question is likely to cause some misunderstanding with the Shaikhs of the Coast, such also is the venture of the Company’s Representatives by their entry from the direction of the coast into a territory which belongs to and lies within the boundaries of Oman.86/7 Telegram To From Political Agent, Bahrain, at Sharjah.

It is undesirable that this individual, who is in the employ of Petroleum Concessions Limited, should be permitted to return to any of the Trucial Coast Shaikhdoms (including Qatar) without previous reference to me. 2. As Williamson (who is a British subject) is a Buropean, under the Foreign Office passport rules he is in any case not permitted to visit the Trucial Coast without previous reference to the Political Agent concerned, and from this point of view this Memorandum may appear unnecessary. Williamson, however, is a Moslem, speaks Arabic like an Arab and generally adopts some form of Arab dress. He has also frequently visited the racial Coast in the past. It might happen, therefore, that he would be given a visa without previous reference. It is for this reason that I considered it safer to issue this Memorandum. sd.

Correspondence ending with my telegram Itfo«504 of 3rd June. Hickinbotham telegraphs that in spite of various interviews which Holmes has had with Shaikh of Sharjah no progress has been made as Shaikh is standing out for better financial terms than were given to Dibai. Hickinbotham adds that Holmes dies not seem to be doing his best to speed up V 2. We must I fear face the fact that, especially in view of Shaikhs previous attitude vide paragraph 1 of my telegram No.473 of 25th May, both he and Ras al Khaimah intend to prolong negotiations until options expire so as to be free to give concessions to Standard Oil Company. This of course will give a lead to the remaining Shaikhs in the same direction and also possibly to Muscat. 3. Signing of Dibai concession was due largely as I have already pointed out to personal promise given by Shaikh of Dibai t 0 me and to presence and efforts of Hickinbotham at Dibai. x can however do no more locally and if the danger in Paragraph 2 above is to be averted further action is necessary. 4. I urge strongly therefore that I should be authorised to inform the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast that with reference to their undertaking of 1922 His Majesty’s Government / negotiations• p 4Government have approved of Petroleum Concessions Limited (as Shaikhs are already aware) and will not accord their approval to the grant of a concession to any other Company. This would have the effect either (a) of inducing the Shaikhs to grant concessions to Petroleum Concessions Limited or (b) of causing them to refuse to grant a concession to any Company at all at any rate for the present. I think that (a) is more likely and would suit us better but even (b) is distinctly preferable to concessions being granted to the Standard Oil Company. 5. We could explain to the Shaikhs that we have not taken this step until one Shaikh (Libai) had given a concession of his own accord to Petroleum Concessions Limited and thereby set a standard that is fair to the Shaikhs. 6. It is just possible that the Shaikh of Sharjah will sign without this warning but time is short owing to early expiry of his option and should he not have signed by say 20th June I would propose communicating the above warning. In the meantime His Majesty^ Government may like to consider this line of action. - Britconsul. (Copy sent to G.of India and Bahrain under P.L.

I was at some pains to explain that Major Holmes was British ana that tne Company was substantially so. i jiti Remarks of this kind are liable to ao harm even wnei *, i said without any actual intention ana I believe that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi T s seeming reluctance to negotiate is due to the fact tnat he has been persuaded that negotiations with Major Holmes would not be in his interests. i 4.

Holmes has infomed Hickinbotham that all Shaikhs have been 'frightened by the Political Agceement', and Company may give this as a reason for their non-success with Sharjah with object of throwing responsibility on His Majesty’s Govern ment. Holmes’ statement is of course rubbish.

Froms To: Office of the Political Agent,Bahrain, Camp, Sharjah. JJated the 7th June 1937* Captain T# Hickinbotham, Political Agent, Bahrain. The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Oulf, Buhhire. - Report on the conduct of the Sharjah negotiation. Sir, I have the honour to report on the conduct of the Sharjah negotiation. 2. On May 30th I arranged for Major Holmes to have an interview with the Shaikh of Sharjah on the morning of the 31st May but owing to some misunderstanding M ajor jiolmes never went to see the Shaikh who waited all morning. On my return from Ras al Khaimah on the after- noon of the 31st May I was immediately informed of the fact that the interview had not taken place and, through the Residency Agent, fixed another time for the following day and personally informed Major Holmes. 3. As a result of the interview on the 1st of June it seems to have been arranged for •Abdullah bin Faris, the Secretary to the Shaikh of Sharjah, to negotiate with Major Holmes. I myself saw •Abdullah bin Faris and impressed on him ho\y advisable it was for the Shaikh to come to agreement with the Company. Conversations then took place between the parties and on one occasion •Abdullah / ’ y I iAbdullah bin Paris was lent the Residency AgenVs car to go to Dubai to see Major Holmes* 4* On the 2nd June Major Holmes told me that he had had a very successful interview with the Secretary and that they hoped the financial question would be settled by the next morning as the Secretary had stated that he would see,his master that night and persuade him to come to agreement. Major Holmes* clerk was also present when this statement was made and gave it as his own opinion that the matter was as good as settled* The following morning Major Holmes called to see me and said nothing had been settled, that the Shaikh had reduced hid demand to Ks.115,000/- and that he, the Major, would not go further than Rs*85,000/- and that he had told ‘Abdullah bin Paris so* I asked him if the other points of which I knew there were a number, as an Arabic copy of them had been given to him by the Shaikh at his interview on the 1st June, had been settled and I gathered that they had not even been discussed. I interviewed the Shaikh on the same after - noon i.e. June 3rd and reasoned with him for an hour and a half all to no purpose* He said that he had given his proposed ammendments to the concession to Major Holmea on the 1st of June and that he had not had any reply from him* Tbat so far he had not discussed the concession at all and that nothing would persuade him to reduce his financial terms from Rs•2,OC,000/- on signature of the concession* I gathered from his general conversation that he was principally concerned with the money question and that his other suggested conditions could be overcome if the money question was satisfactorally solved* Eventually I decided that I could do no more than arrange an interview for Major Holmes with the Shaikh which I did- 3 - u ji 1 for £ Friday June 4tJi«Af'ter again advicing ■the Shaikh to do all he could to bring about an early agreement I returned to the Rest House and informed Major Holmes of what had taken place at my interview c3.nl the conclusions X had come to* X told Major Holmes that in my opinion and that of the Residency Agent, the Shaikh was not influenced by any member of his family and unlike Dubai had no council to consult before agree ing to the various clauses of the concession and that the only man who had any influence with him was his Secretary, f Abdullah bin Paris. I further told the Majorthat in all probability, the Shaikh would try and pretend that he was not a free agent and that he must consult his relatives, but that in my opinion this cjnounteo to nothing and would only be used as an endeavour! to squeeze more out of the Company* 5* On June 4th Major Holmes had a lengthy interview with the Shaikh. I saw him immediately afterwards and he appear satisfied with the morning 1 s work. Immediately after Major Homes had left me. I saw the Residency Agent who had come straight from the Shaikh. He told me that only three points wetk had been discussed m in two and a half hours and no conclusion reached on them. I had decided that if I wished to form a reasonable opinion of the progress of events, it was necessary for me to hear the views of both sides and, for this reason, ^ rorn this day I arranged for the Residency Agent to interview the Shaikh as soon as the representative of Petroleum Concessions had left. This procedure does not appear to have pleased Major Holmes but it has attained its object as far as I am concerned. 6 . On June 5th another interview took place and afterwards Maj or Holmes informed me that he had not madeas much progress as he had hoped and that the Shaikh had put forward four of his points which were la) that the oil, if any, should be piped to Sharjah for export (b) that a drilling programme should be included in the concession (c) that if the work had not commenced in three years, the Shaikh Should have the right to cancel the agreement and(d) that the Arabic version of the concession agreement should prevail. Major Holmes informed the Shaikh that he could not even consider these ammendments. Again I understood the kajor to say that no mention had been made of the financial clause as . yet J the Shaikh had intimated that he was not/ready to discuss the matter. Later I discussed the question with the Residency Agent who had seen the Shaikh since ^jor Holmes’ interview and he told me that the Shaikh had informed him that only the following points remained outstanding and that all the rest had been settled:- 1. i*hat any oil found should be piped to Shariah ^ for export. d ■’ 2 . That the Arabic version of the concession should prevail. 3. An alteration to Article 13. 4. That money paid tp the Shaikh by the Company will not be refunded for any reason. 5. That flag of the Shaikh shchuld be fl$wn at the fields. 6 . That such guards as the Shaikh considers suitable are to be appointed by him. *• That correspondence between the Shaikh and Company to be in Arabic. 8. That the Shaikh f s London representative should be one whom the Shaikh selects even if he does not know xxxfeiKx English. 9. Drilling to commence within five years of date of signature. « 10. The question of the intial and yearly payments to be settled. 1 Before the Residency Agent had left me, the Secretary to the Shaikh came to the Rest House and told us that the Shaikh had forgotten one other point which } a // nsQ not beon ssttlsd ancl whicb w&amp;s as follows That Jabal Fayah and Wadi al Hilu should not be worked until II conditions are settled.-5- l Cm-) As will be seen only points number 2 and number 9 offer any real difficulty of solution and,in my opinion, even these could be overcome by determined persuaion on the part of the Company's Representapve* On June 6th Major Holmes had another lengthy interview with the Shaikh of Sharjah and saw me directly afterwards• He had a list of ammendments which his clerk read 'to me# He said he A w]?it.ing 'to his Company• I expressed surprise that he was not cabling and he said he would cable but would have to write as well. He said that the ammendments were the ones that the Shaikh was holding out over and that he could not agree to them, but had promised to refer to his Company. He said he had told the Shaikh that he was not prepared to pay more for the Sharjah concession than he had for the Dubai concession. It is worth noting here that he had already told the Shaikh's Secretary that he would pay Rs*85,000/- which is Rs*5,000/- more than he confesses paying at Dubai. He told me that the Shaikh was fright ened and alleged that the * Political 1 had frightened him and hinted that if this was not so he would have made more progress. He said ha had made no further appointment with the Shaikh. He further stated that he might or might not cable his principals that day. I said that if he was going to delay matters by writing and not cabling then I could see no reason why I should wait and he agreed. The Residency Agent whom I saw in Major Holmes'spresence confirmed that the financial question had not been fully discussed and that Major Hcpnes had broken off the discussions to refer to his Company. 8 . On the 5th June I suggested to i^ajor Holmes that he should conduct the Ajman negotiation at the same time and he said that he could not as he had had no reply /- 6 - written some eight days previously. I would have suggested that the Urn al ^aiwain negotiation be commenced as well, but owing to the present situation there, I thought it better to wait. On the same evening I called at Ajman which is 15 minutes from here and spoke to the Shaikh about the situation. He agreed that he had failed to answer the letter but expressed willingness to see Major holmes any morning that he liked. I told the Shaikh I would inform the Major Holmes. I did so on the doming of the 6th June and Major Holmes said he was disinclined to enter into any further negotiations while this one was in progress and that he proposed to deal with Has al Khaimah next# On my pressing him to save time by conducting both the negotiations at the same time, he said that he could not do it. That it was too much to do. 9© Major Holmes does not appear anxious to start even preliminary interview^with the other neighbouring Shaikhs. He did not appear anxious to commence dealings direct with the Shaikh of Sharjah and has bven mentioned the possibilty of extending the option period to the Shaikh. He is contemplating taking a house in Sharjah for his clerk, while he lives at the Rest House# have convinced me that either he is no longer capable of carrying on a very trying task ifc hot weather or else for some reason v/hich I am unable even to suggest he is not anxious to conclude the negotiations as quickly as possible# The general tone of his conduct of negotiations I have the honour to be, Sir, Ypyir most obedient servant.

I 7?7 ; CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS VTCV ! l c 9 D.O.No. 39 -1C/12* Sharjah, 11 th, dune 1937• / &lt;n 11 There have been a number of interviews&gt;(vbw€en us and they have all of them been difficult to follow as Holmes will contradict himself as many as three times in ten minutes and is never consistent in his viev/s for more than two days and some times for not as long. I believe he is anxious to prolong the negotiation as much as possible and intends to blame the Political for his lack of success. My idea has been and will continue to be to press both parties to reach agreement in the shortest possible space of time. Holmes blames his Company for hindering him by the uncompromising attitude they have adopted regarding the Shaikh*s demands but fails to point out that theirj attitude is in accordance with his recommendations to them. At one period of the conversation he said he had asked for Longrigg to come out to personally conduct the negotiation. Holmes seems very anxious to be out of the whole business for his /%/n ends. I believe that he is anxious to form a Company of his fc\^n to try for Concessions in the Aden Protectorate a. behind tvlukalla. He hopes to have^75% British and 25 # American f Company. 2 . I am hoping that whatever pressure I have been able to bring to bear personally and through Khan Sahib 'Abdur Razzaq, who has been most helpful, will result in a considerable advance being made today inspite of Holmes. » le Lieut-Colonel Sir Trenchard C.Fowle, K.C.I.E.,C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, J3 nNote of a conversation between Major U’rank Holmes and the Folitical Agent,Bahrain, on the night of lip June the 10th 1937• June 11th* Major Holmes came to the Rest House last night in an excitable frame of mind and immediately began accusing the M Political ,f of having frightened all the Shaikhs* I asked him what he meant by this statement, but he was unwilling to make himself clear* The statement was made in an offensive tone and I pressed him to tell me the source of his information as he said M everyone ' had told him ' whereever he went ' but he said that he was unwilling to name his informants to me in case harm befell them. I asked him if he considered the ' frightening M of the Shaikhs detrimental to his Company's interests. He would not answer clearly, but in turn asked my opinion. I told him my opinion was not in question at the moment, but that 1 was anxious for his as 1 wished to keep the Resident informed of the situation. Major Holmes refused to give a definite answer. He then informed me that although he had received a reply from his Company rejecting the Shaikh's demands he was not proposing to inform the Shaikh of his Company's decision. I expressed surprise at this as 1 felt sure that the Shaikh would expect a definite reply especially as he, Holmes, had suspended his negotiations to await the Company's reply to the question put to them at the Shaikh's request* He told me that he proposed to endeavour to extend the present period of Option with a view to settling the agreement immediately afterwards, as by this means, he would be able to obtain more money from his Company by paying the Shaikh the amount due on account of the unexpired portion of the option without these money transactions appearing in the actual concession agreement where a large figure might be detrimental to future business /tllfb business dealings. He complained bitterly that the generous terms of the Qatar Concession had put prices up allroun d. I told Holmes that I did not follow business methods but felt that firm negotiation and a rise in the financial terms originally suggested would result in a concluded Concession agreement in Sharjah. I told Holmes that I had seen the Shaikh of Um- al - Qaiwain that morning, dune 10th, onTTolitical matter and was surprised to learn from him that he had never received a copy of the draft Concession agreement. Holmes said that he had never sent him one nor had he sent one to Ajman ant^no intention of sending either of them copies and that he could not understand why I was surprised. T told him I was surprised as he had himself assured me that all the Shaikhs had copies of the proposed agreements. Holmes denied ever having made such a statement and said that I always seemed to misunderstand him. I said apparently I had on several occasions such as at Dubai before the Concession agreement was signed, when I asked him in the presence of the assembled Shaikhs and witnesses if all was in order with the agreement from his Company's point of view and he had stated that as far as the Company was concerned all was in order. He said that he must be permittc ” e d t0 ne Sotiate in his own way and not be hindered by Political complications and that the recent action at Um - al - Qaiwain had frightened the Shaikhs. I pointed out to him that no one wished to hamper his negotiations but that although a number of matters requiring attention had been allowed to remain in abeyance so that his negotiat- ions would not be disturbed, it was not possible to refrain from action in all cases and that on this occasion any action that had been taken had, in my opinion, rather advanced than retarded his interests. X further pointed ou t that his change of attitude was difficult to understand as he had stated, after the Dubai agreement was signed, that if /- 3 - iu7 i 1,1,1 if a Political Officer had not come down then it would never have been signed and that the last thing he wanted to happen was for me to return as his chances at Sharjah and Ras-al- Khaimah would be very much lessened thereby. He asked me if I was still of opinion that the Shaikh of Sharjah w'as not influenced by his relatives, and I said yes that the only person that had any influence was his Secretary, ‘Abdullah bin Paris. He asked my opinion of the other Shaikhs and how far they were influenced by their relatives. I told him that Abu Dhabi was, probably, influenced by his uncle, Shaikh Khalifah, and the leading merchant, Ahmad bin Khalaf, who had recently arrived in Dubai, that Ajman was not influenced by anyone, that Urn - al - Qaiwain had a strong body of relatives! and advisers to deal with and was very much under their influence in external matters, and that Has - al - Khaimah was influenced by a Qadhi, who was, I believed from Hajd. I then informed him of the present situation in Ras-al- Khaimah. In answer to an enquiry from me, he told me that he had had a favourable reply from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. As he said that he received this reply by the hand of Ahmad bin Khalaf, I have sent the Residency Agent to Dubai to obtain first hand information of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi's reactions to Holmes' letter. 3. In answer to a leading remark of Holmes, l told him that in a case where speed was essential as it was in this instance, it was to me difficult to understand the present I intentions of the Company. They started negotiations with Sharjah when the Ras-al-Khaimah Option expired first and had refrained from the other Shaikhs with their terms to Ui ider^ bile oonei negotiations were in progress nor was it their intention to do so until they a.ctually commenced negotiating with them and that the Abu Dhabi negotiation had been /been held up by a peculiar misunderstanding and delaying of letters. 4. Holmes asked if his Secretary Ashraf should leave I thought that the house of Rais Hasan, and I said that/the less he was mixed up with Rais Hasan, the better. I had on two previous occaisions warned Holmes of the danger of conducting his negotiations through this individual and he told me that he had given up all contact with him long ago and that his Secretary had nothing to do with him. I had recently learnt that Holmes’ Secretary has been and still is living with Rais Hasan. Later in the evening Holmes told me that the 5 . Secretary to the Shaikh of Sharjah had said that he wished to * see him before he interviewed the Shaikh and asked if I thought that he would be advised to see the man. I said certainly as presumably the man had some communication to make either on his own or his master^ behalf, and thax it would be as well to know what it was before he saw the Shaikh. 1 told him that the Shaikh would certainly know of his Secretary’s intention to visit him, and that there could be no objection from the Shaikh’s point of view, as he had appointed his Secretary in the first instance as his negotiator. I further told Holmes that I thought he should in any case see the shaikh in person in the afternoon if he received the Secretary : f in the morning. Sharjah, 11th, June 1937.

The correspondence discusses the amendments to the agreement which the Shaikh wished to make, various conditions he wished to place on the concession. and negotiations over the financial terms of a potential concession. A draft copy of the concession agreement can be found at folios 94-111.Also discussed is the signing of the Debai [Dubai] concession and PCL's acceptance of the signed copy; along with the written agreement given by Shaikh Sa’id bin Maktum al Maktum [Saʻīd bin Maktūm Āl Maktūm] to the Political Resident regarding a termination of contract undertaking.Further correspondence between the Political Agent at Bahrain, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Secretary of State for India considers methods of applying pressure on the Trucial Coast Shaikh’s to sign concessions with Petroleum Concessions Limited in order to prevent American interests from acquiring concessions in the area. A letter is issued by the Secretary of State for India, on behalf of the British Government, to be used if negotiations and initial pressure failed to secure the concessions. The letter made it clear that the British Government would not permit more than one Oil Company to operate on the Trucial Coast and that they had approved agreements with PCL and were not prepared to permit negotiations with other Companies. The intention was for the letter to be used as a last resort as there could be difficulties if either Petroleum Concessions Limited or the Trucial Coast Shaikh’s came to learn of its existence before it was required.Other matters of note within the volume include:circular issued by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to all Consuls and Political Agents with powers to grant visa’s requesting that no visa for the Trucial Coast be granted to Haji ‘Abdullah Williamson without prior discussion with the Political Resident. Also included is a note of a discussion which the Political Resident had with Mr Gordon, Assistant General Manager for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company at Abadan, regarding Williamson’s activities on the Trucial Coast whilst being employed by Petroleum Concessions Limited;report on a conversation between the Political Agent at Bahrain and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi (Shaikh Shakhbūt bin Sulṭān bin Zāyid Āl Nahyān) over statements made to the Shaikh about Major Frank Holmes and Petroleum Concessions Limited and their British status, which the Political Agent was able to correct; and concerns about rumours being spread on the Trucial Coast which could cause problems for both PCL and the British Government;draft copies in Arabic and English of the proposed Umm-al-Qaiwain [Umm al Qaywayn] concession agreement (ff 48-65), Ajman Concession agreement (ff 30-47), and Ras al Khaimah [Ra's al Khaymah] concession agreement (ff 112-129);Correspondence regarding a disturbance in Kalba [Kalbā] which had briefly prevented individuals visiting Ras al Khaimah;letter from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman (Sayyid Taymūr bin Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa‘īd) to the Political Agent at Muscat (Ralph Ponsonby Watts) regarding an encroachment by the Geologists for Petroleum Concessions Limited into his territory in the Buraimi [Al Buraymī] district; and observations by the Political Agent of the need to define the limits of the Sultan’s territory as soon as possible.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Concessions Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Dubai, Āl Maktūm dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Frank Holmes</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>William Richard Williamson</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Debai</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Ras al Khaimah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Dubai</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Sharjah</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00028a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
