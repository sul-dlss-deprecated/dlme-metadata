Uniforms for Chancery Messengers and Chauffeurs Sir, At some Missions the supply of uniforms has been authorised for Chancery messengers and chauffeurs. It has now been decided to make this a general practice and to supply from the United Kingdom standard uniforms for Chancery messengers and drivers of official motor vehicles at all Missions and Consular posts. 2. The scale of issue will be as follows:— chauffeurs 1 Cap —blue worsted serge with brass badge (Royal Arms and supporters). 1 Tunic —blue worsted serge, double breasted with side vents and 4 brass buttons. (32 ligne—Royal Arms and supporters.) 2 pairs of Trousers —blue worsted serge. 1 Greatcoat —blue cloth, double breasted with 6 brass buttons (38 ligne—Royal Arms and supporters) in front and 2 small brass buttons at back (1 at each end of half belt). chancery messengers 1 Cap —blue worsted serge with gold embroidered crown. 1 Tunic —blue worsted serge, double breasted with 4 brass buttons (32 ligne—Royal Arms and supporters) and embroidered crowns on lapels. 2 pairs of Trousers —blue worsted serge. 1 Greatcoat —blue cloth, single breasted with 5 brass buttons (38 ligne—Royal Arms and supporters) and gold embroidered crowns on lapels. Raincoats may be supplied on request instead of greatcoats, but they will not normally be issued in addition to them. At some places a lighter summer uniform will be required in place of the serge one or in addition to it. In these cases we propose to send you sufficient khaki drill material, together with an appropriate number His Majesty's Superintending Consular Officers. ^ * 7 15447;^,; O I , /2 of buttons and badges, to enable you to have the uniforms made locally. 3 Will you therefore please let me have the names and appointments of the men at your post who should now be issued with uniforms, stating at the same time whether serge or khaki drill uniforms, or both, are required? Except where khaki drill uniforms only are required, the measurements of each individual should be given. A specimen measurement lorm is enclosed with this circular. 4. You should ask for uniforms only on behalf of men who are likely to remain in service for at least a further six months. Uniforms will not be issued to clerical workers or any employees other than drivers and Chancery messengers. 5. In the normal course of events uniform suits will be expected to last for eighteen months, caps for one year, and greatcoats for four years. When a man leaves your service he should be required to surrender his uniform, even if it is worn out. 6. A similar circular has been addressed to His Majesty s Representatives (as No. 053). I am.

'90 Supply of Uniforms Dear Consulate-General, Consulate, The supply of uniforms is not yet going as smoothly as it ought, nor as efficiently as either you or we would like. We have been going into this matter very closely and the purpose of this letter is to explain to you how matters can be improved. 2. We get many complaints and these are all either on account of delay or of misfits. 3. Part of the delay is caused by non-observance of the instruction put forward in XAO 23 (15/49) of 5th November, 1949. You will recollect that letter explained that the standard order forms should be used for all articles except stationery supplies. When this is not done all orders have to be recast and copied out here (and they are by no means the only orders with which our very small supply section has to deal) and this takes up time quite unnecessarily. 4. A surprising number of posts fail to make clear exactly hat garments they want, and this means that the order cannot be started without first referring back to the post for further detail. Each garment that is required must be accurately specified, and it helps the supplier if the accepted descriptions only are used. A list of them is appended to this letter {see Appendix ' C '). We attach also an example of an imaginary demand {see Appendix ' A '). 5. The large number of misfits that occur are almost all due to faulty measuring. Although on the face of it this should be a very simple matter, it is a known fact that a professional usually produces measurements quite different from what a layman does for the same victim. In future, therefore, whenever it is possible to do so, measurements should always be taken by the local tailor and where it is necessary a small fee may be paid for this service His Majesty's Consular Officers 16288 38945—322 and charged to ' Incidentals For your information the usual charge for this in the U .K. is 2^. 6d. 6. A good deal of delay will be cut out in the Post Office Supplies Dept. (from whom the clothing is obtained) if their form SD 1026K (duplicate) is made out and sent with the order. In future this X should be done, and a supply of forms is sent herewith. 7. You will note that the form SD 1026K allows for three names on each form, but the Post Office ask particularly that only one name shall appear on each form, and that a separate form be used for each man {see Appendix ' B '). 8. Different articles come to the Post Office Issue Depot from several manufacturers, and in the past it has been the practice to send out items separately. The Post Office have now improved their system and in future the whole of a set will be assembled and sent out together. 9. We cannot emphasise too strongly that really careful attention to these details at your end will enable us to meet your requirements very much more satisfactorily in future. 10. We are prepared to consider supplying lengths of cloth to allow uniform to be made up locally in cases where reliable tailoring facilities at reasonable cost exist. This might cut out certain delays and ensure better fitting, but we should expect the style to conform to the pattern of uniform at present supplied from the U.K. Local tailoring might not be feasible at some posts and very costly at others. We would welcome your views on the suggestion and an indication of probable local costs. C onference and S upply D ept.APPENDIX ' A ' (Specimen) item quantity no. description Uniforms for drivers H.
