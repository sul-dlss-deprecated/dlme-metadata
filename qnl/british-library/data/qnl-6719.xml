India Office to Foreign Office .— (Received March 4.) Sir, ' India Office, March 3, 1904. WITH reference to your letter of the 17th March, 1902, forwarding telegrams from Sir N. O’Conor on the subject of the claims of the Sheikh of Koweit to Bubiyan Island, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Brodrick to inclose a copy of a letter from the Govern ment of India dated the 4th February, 1904. In consideration of the importance which Lord Curzon, after visiting the spot with the In aval Commander-in-chief, attaches to this question, Mr. Brodrick desires again to bring the matter before the Marquess of Lansdowne for his consideration. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) A. GODLEY. In closure in No. 1. % Government of India to Mr. Brodrick. (Secret.) Sir Fort William., February 4, 1904. * IN his Secret despatch dated the 17th December his Excellency the Viceroy briefly mentioned his recent visit to Koweit and the Khor Abdulla, and the prospects of the shores of this waterway as a future possible railway terminus. YYe now have the honour to address you in greater detail on the subject. 2. It will be within the recollection of His Majesty’s Government that early in 1902 it was reported that the Turks had established a post at the head ot the Khor Abdulla. The Commander of His Majesty’s ship “ Sphinx,” who was sent to inquire into the matter, visited the locality between the 14th and the 19th February, and reported that, in addition to a position which they had occupied at Um Kasr, the lurks had, for the first time about a fortnight previously, stationed a force of some twenty men on the south-east corner of Bubiyan Island. This unwarranted encroachment was at once brought to the notice of your predecessor, reference was made to the importance of the positions seized, and it was proposed by the Viceroy that the Turks should be told that they must at once leave Bubiyan, even if no protest were offered against the occupation of Um Kasr. On the 26th March Lord George Hamilton telegraphed that it was considered inadvisable to raise irritating discussions about the movements ot Turkish troops to places to which the Sheikh’s title would be difficult to prove, and it was explained that His Majesty’s Government did not wish to obstruct the prolonga tion of the Bagdad Railway to the Gulf, whether at Koweit or elsewhere. It was added, however, that their assistance would be conditional upon British capital receiving, in respect of construction, materials, and management, at least equal shares with any other Power. In the event, no action was taken to assert the Chief’s claims beyond an [818] B t2 intimation to the Porte that their action was regarded as constituting a disturbance of the status quo, and that the occupation of the places in question could not be regarded as in any way prejudicing the Sheikh’s rights and authority over them, and the Turkish posts still remain at Um Kasr and A1 Geit, where they were then established. 3. The importance of the question lies in its relation to the future probable terminus of what is known as the Bagdad Railway. Article I of the Convention dated the 21st January, 1902, between the Turkish Government and the promoters of this enterprise provides that the projected railway shall run from Zobeir to a point on the Persian Gulf to be determined by mutual agreement between the Ottoman Porte and the Company, and there appears to be no doubt that the Turkish advance of 1902 to the shores of Khor Abdulla and the Island of Bubivan was designed to enable the concessionnaires to secure, without reference to His Majesty’s Government, what was already recognized by the German engineers, and has since been generally acknow ledged, to be the most suitable terminus on the Gulf. The first section of the line is now, we understand, in course of construction by German enterprise unaided, and no arrangements have been made, as far as we are aware, in respect of any portion of the railway from Konia to the Persian Gulf for securing the condition whereby His Majesty’s Government contemplated that equality of treatment should be secured lor British capital. 4. During his recent tour in the Gulf the Viceroy personally visited the Khor Abdulla, in company with the Naval Commander-in-chief on the East Indies Station, and the result of the inspection was to confirm the view which we previously entertained of the importance of the Khor and of the superiority of its shores, for the purpose of a railway terminus, over any of the sites in the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit which have previously claimed attention. On board the “ Lawrence ” their Excellencies passed up the channel to the anchorage below the junction of Khor Zobeir with KhorUm Kasr, and except at the eastern end of Warba Island, where there is a bar with a depth of 2 fathoms for a short distance, a depth of 4^ fathoms was obtained throughout. The anchorage is some 3 miles from Um Kasr post, and the banks of the channel are sufficiently high to provide a firm and convenient landing place. To the south of the Warba Island lies the large sheet of water with plenty of depth and room for an anchorage, to which Rear-Admiral Willes refers in paragraph 50 of his letter dated the 8th December, 1903, to the Secretary to the Admiralty, of which we inclose a copy. Owing to the length of the channel and its capacity for easy land or submarine defences, a port in either of these localities would be absolutely safe from any attack from the seaward. ^ — We have already intimated in our Secret despatch dated the 21st January, 1904, that the remarks of the Naval Commander-in-chief in paragraph 51 of this letter were written under a misapprehension, and do not accurately represent the political position. It is not necessary here, therefore, to take them into account. 5. In our Secret despatch dated the 4th February, 1904, we have mentioned the probable antagonism of German interests to our own in this quarter, and the attitude which, in our opinion, should be adopted towards the designs of other nations in Turkish Arabia, and w e consider that no time should be lost in endeavouring to retrieve, so far as may still be possible, the position which we have so seriously endangered by acquiescence in these encroachments. So far as concerns Um Kasr and the neigh bouring mainland, the claims of the Sheikh of Koweit do not appear to have been strong. But whatever may have been their validity, it would be difficult, and we would not now propose to try, to induce the Turks to abandon the occupation which for the past year they have been permitted to maintain. The case of Bubiyan Island we regard as entirely different. Here we consider that the~Sheikh has claims which can be sustained alike with better reason, with greater prospect of success, and, owing to its insular position, with smaller rnk of subsequent embarrassment to ourselves. In Febiuary 1902 our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that Sheikh Mubarak had addressed to him a written communication in which he advanced his claim to the island, and asserted that the Avazem tribe, who are his subjects, had lived there since the occupation of Koweit for seven months during the summer of each year, and had established fishing inclosures on the island. Colonel Kembail regarded the pretension as valid, and a like view appears to have been held by His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, who a few days later telegraphed to the Marquess of Lansdowne that the Consul at Bussorah considered the feheikh’s claim to the island to be good. Sir Nicholas O’Conor, however, expressed the opinion that there was no object in raising a conflict about Bubiyan Island while leaving the Turks in possession of Um Kasr, Had the Ambassador then been in possession of the3 (!! information which is now available, wc believe that he would not have entertained this view. With the shores of the mainland and of Bubiyan island in the possession of a single Power, the anchorages below Urn Kasr and at Warbi island can at any time be converted into an impregnable harbour, and even if the day is still distant when the banks of the Khor Abdulla are likely to be armed with foreign forts or batteries, the undivided occupation by a German Railway Company of a potentially invulnerable position is not calculated to conduce to the enhancement either of British commercial prosperity or of British political prestige. Supposing, however, that we are able to make good Sheikh Mubarak’s claims, we at once place ourselves in a position to establish, at the north end of Bubiyan Island, a post which would command not only \ the anchorage, but also the approaches up the Khor Abdulla, and we acquire the power : to assert, in such a manner as our paramount interests demand, our right to participate in all arrangements relative to the prospective terminus of the Anatolian Railway. An additional argument, if any is needed, in favour of strengthening our position at Bubiyan may, perhaps, be found in the fact that the khor is used as a place of refuge by pirates whom the Turkish Government is unable to control, and who, as shown in the Administration Report of the Rersian Gulf for 1902-1903, commit piracies off Bubiyan. 6. His Majesty’s Government have never admitted the Turkish claim to the island, and have, indeed, protested against the interference with the status quo involved in the placing of a post at A1 Geit, where, prior to the month of February 1902, the Turks had never pretended to exercise an authority even of the most shadow r y description, and . where the total garrison now consists of so me six men. On the same occasion we were informed by Lord George Hamilton that the British Government would resist a Turkish adva nce on the Koweit side of Subbiyeh. This place is separated only by a channel from the southern end ofllubiyan Island, and the claims of the Sheikh to both positions seem to us to be of equal validity. 7 . The proposal accordingly which we submit for your consideration is that the Porte should now be informed that we are unable to recognize their right to maintain a station on Bubiyan, and should be requested to withdraw their troops; while at the same time we should establish a post on behalf of Sheikh Mubarak on the northern end of the island opposite to the southern anchorage. The Sheikh has always urged his claims to this island, and during the Viceroy’s visit to Koweit he repeatedly asked why the Turks were not compelled to evacuate both Bubiyan and Um Kasr, which belonged to him. He has several boats, and could easily, with small support from us, prevent Turkish troops from crossing the Khor Subbiyeh or channel between Bubiyan and the mainland on the west. Should His Majesty’s Government deem it advisable to spare the Sultan’s susceptibilities by the adoption of a less pronounced course of action, we think it possible that our object might be secured by intimating that we regard Bubiyan Island as belonging to the Sheikh, and that, unless the Turkish force is with drawn, we shall be constrained to support him in establishing a post on the northern shore to balance the Turkish posts at Um Kasr and A1 Geit. In this case the Turks would probably retire, and the island would remain unoccupied. The Sheikh w’ould then resume possession, and it would only remain for us to carry out hereafter such further measures as might be necessary for the maintenance of our legitimate interests. We have, &amp;c. (Signed) CURZON. KITCHENER. T. RALEIGH. E. F.-G. LAW. E. R. ELLES. A. T. ARUNDEL. DENZIL IBBETSON. No. 2. India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received April 11.) Sir, India Office, April 11, 1905. WITH reference to your letters of the 13th and 31st May, 1901, on the subject of the Turkish military posts at Bubiyan Island, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Brodrick4 lo transmit, for the consideration of the Marquess of Lansdowne, a copy of a letter from the Government of India inquiring whether, in the opinion of His Majesty s Government, the time has not now come for instructing His Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople to remind the Porte of previous remonstrances against the maintenance of their military station on the south-east corner ot the island, and to press for its withdrawal. Mr. Brodrick is of opinion that, nearly a year having elapsed since the date ot the conversation between Sir N. O’Conor and the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs (reported in his despatch No. 372 of the 16th May, 1904), and no action having apparently been taken by the Turkish Government in the matter, His Majesty s Ambassador might now be instructed, in accordance with the authority conveyed to him in Lord Lansdowne’s despatch of the 10th May last, to press for the removal of the post on Bubiyan Island. _ It is a matter for consideration whether His Majesty s Ambassador might not further be instructed, in accordance with the suggestion, contained in his despatch No. 249 of the 5th April, 1904, to state to the Porte that, unless the Turkish force is withdrawn, His Majesty’s Government will be constrained to support the Sheikh of Koweit in establishing a post of his own on the island. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) A. GODLEY. Inclosure in No. 2. Government of India to Mr. Brodrick. (Secret.) . gj r Fort William, March 16, 1905. WE have the honour to refer to our despatch of the 4th February, 1904, and to the subsequent telegraphic correspondence ending with your telegram of the 18th May, 1905, on the subject of the measures that should be t^ken to obtain the evacuation of Bubiyan Island by the Turkish troops which are at present stationed there. 2. In that despatch we submitted, for your consideration, the following alternative proposals:— (a.) That the Porte should be informed that we were unable to recognize their right to maintain a station on Bubiyan, and should be requested to withdraw their troops; while at the same time we should establish a post on behalf of Sheikh Mubarak on the’northern end of the island opposite to the southern anchorage. We pointed out that he had several boats, and could easily, with small support from us, prevent Turkish troops from crossing the Khor Subbiyeh or channel between Bubiyan and the mainland on the west. (6.) Should His Majesty’s Government deem it advisable to spare the Sultan’s susceptibilities by the adoption of a less pronounced course of action, we suggested that our object might be secured by intimating that we regarded Bubiyan Island as belonging to the Sheikh, and that, unless the Turkish force were withdrawn, we should be constrained to support him in^establishing a post on the northern shore to balance the Turkish posts at ITm Kasr and Al Geit. We observed that in this case the luiks would probably retire, and the island would remain unoccupied. The Sheikh would then resume possession, and it would only remain for us to carry out hereafter such further measures as might be necessary for the maintenance of our legitimate interests. 3. Since then the following action has been taken : — In April 1904, His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople suggested to the Marquess of Lansdowne that he should first remind the Porte of his previous remonstrances against the maintenance of a Turkish military station on the south-east corner of the island and press for its withdrawal, and that then, if after a lapse of some months his representations bad produced no effect, the second alternative intimation referred to above should be made to the Turkish Government. On the 10th May, Sir N. O’Conor w^as authorized to take action in accordance with his own suggestion, and on the 18th May we were informed that, should the intimation remain for some time without effect, the active measures recommended in our despatch to you of the 4th February would be considered further.i ?0 5 ISC On the 16th May Sir N. O’Conor reported to Lord Lansdowne the representations which he had made to the Porte.. His Excellency carried out his intention ot reminding the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the remarks which he a ma e ^ in regard to the establishment of Turkish military posts at Urn Kasr and Bubiyan Island but did not, it appears, avail himself of the authorization which had been given him for making the alternative intimation originally suggested by us, and practically confined himself to saying that he trusted that the Turkish Government would see the propriety of causing the Turkish soldiers to be withdrawn, and would save mm trom tne ‘‘unpleasant duty of returning to the subject in a more unpleasant form, as he \'Ould be obliged to do unless the matter were arranged within a short time. 4. Since then no further representation appears to have been made to the 1 orte until the 3rd November, when His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires pointed out that the continued maintenance of the post was looked upon by Bis Majesty’s Government as an infringement of the status r/wo, and that the written protest made by His Majesty g Embassy still remained unanswered. Reference may also be made^ to the fact tnat, on the 30th December, you informed Lord Ampthill that His Majesty’s Government were unable to accept his suggestion that the removal of the Political Agent at Koweit should be made conditional on the removal of the Turkish post on Bubiyan Island. 5. Nothing has, however, happened since the date of their original recommendation to induce the Government of India to depart from their contention as to the importance of obtaining by some means the removal of the r l urkish troops. 6. In our previous despatch on the subject we have already furnished you \wth a full statement of the reasons which have led us to adopt this view'; and wc need not now do more than point out that the Turkish troops meanwhile remain in the island; that it is evident that the remonstrances made have not been treated with sufficient seriousness by the Turkish Government, who, with the continued postponement of the withdrawal of their troops, are in some degree' increasing their presu . ptive right of dominion over Bubiyan in the eyes of the world in general; and that consequently every additional day of inaction will render it more difficult for His Majesty s Govern ment to insist ultimately on evacuation. _ . . , 7. In these circumstances, we have the honour to inquire whether His Majesty s Government do not consider that the time has now come when His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople might with advantage be provided with definite instructions to make to the Porte the intimation which was authorized in May last, and also whether they will not agree to take into their immediate consideration the advisability of adopting the alternative local measures recommended by us in February 1904, which we still consider to be of urgent importance for the proper protection of British interests in the Persian Gulf.

Government of India to Mr. Morlcy.—(Commvnicated to Foreign Office .) (Secret.) Simla, July 12, 1906. WE have the honour to address you on the subject of the Anatolian Railway to Bao-dad and the Persian Gulf, with special reference to the effect which its construction may be expected to have upon Indian interests in the Middle East, and particularly in Persia and the Persian Gulf. 2. In paragraph 2 of our Secret frontier despatch No. 27 of 1904, we premised that it was an accepted principle with His Majesty’s Government that, should the line ever be continued south of Bagdad, this could not be done without British co-operation and consent; and that no terminal port could be selected unless a similar consent had been obtained, and unless the port were made open and international in character. In para- [818] C6 graph 2 o, our Secret External despatch dated the 4th February, 1904, we referred to a te J egram from Lord George Hamilton dated the 2Gth March, 1902, in which it was stated that the assistance of His Majesty’s Government with regard to the proloncm- mn ot the Bagdad Railway to the Persian Gulf would be conditional upon British capital receiving, m respect of construction/materials, and management, at least equal shares with any other Power. 1 f, W 0 }lave not hitherto offered our detailed opinion upon the matter, because, rom the information available to us, the prosecution of the scheme appeared to be )stract ®. ^ J.'! 0 Carriers which could not be raised without the assistance and co-operation of His Majesty’s Government. We understood that the promoters of the sen erne would find it difficult to raise capital for more than the first few sections of the line and that for the remainder funds would have to be provided by enhance- ment °t the customs revenues, which would require the consent of the Powers including that of Great Britain. It seemed likely therefore that, apart from political considerations, purely financial needs would compel the Company sooner or later to commence negotiations with a view to the co-operation of His Majesty’s Government. Again although the point where the line would terminate on the shore of the ersian had been left undecided, and is still not settled, yet it seemed most probable that the terminus to be selected would be either at or near Koweit which is under our special control, orpn the Klior Abdulla, bn the confines of Koweit territory over against the Island of Bubiyan. We have in our despatch dated the 4th February’ • j sub 3 mitted P r0 P&lt;*als for the vindication of Sheikh Mubarak’s rights to this is and and we conceived that the existence of important British interests in this locality would tend to postpone the acquisition of any outlet for the railway in Persian waters obtained 0 C ° nSent ^ appr ° Val of His Majesty's Government had been sought and In view of the Indian interests at stake, we felt sure that His Majesty’s Govern- ment wmdd not be likely to formulate any decision in regard to these two matters p ( discussion of the subject at anytime take a practical form, without consulting the Government of India and we therefore abstained from presenting our views on the question until a suitable opportunity should occur. 4. From information which has recently been furnished to us by His Majestv’s \ 0wever ’ we x se ? f ravre reason for apprehending that the safeguards upon which we relied as a natural bulwark for our interests are about to melt away, leaving us isolated and exposed to all the dangers which might be expected to result from the independent construction of the railway by our political rivals. In the first place . a* Hi Con J or L ln hls Confidential despatch No. 249, dated the 12th April, 1906 0 bm Ldward Grey, stated that it was improbable that the Germans, if they once’ sin mounted the difficulties, financial and other, attending the construction of the line uough the Taurus Range, and reached the open plain beyond it, would be willing to permit the participation of the British Government in the scheme on favourable terms, is Excellency added that, if the Germans were unable to obtain assistance for the 1 anrus section, they might find themselves forced to seek another combination invo ving less expenditure by avoiding the mountains, and by constructing a line from regh, or from some point west of Eregli direct to Mersina, whence by utilizing the existing Mersina-Adana Railway the line could be continued eastwards on the^route originally planned. ^ I he fact that the Germans have recently obtained a controlling interest in the Mersina-Adana line is an ominous indication of the likelihood of the Company adopting the course foreshadowed by Sir N. O’Conor. By this move not only ia\e the Germans carried out the condition of the contract requiring them to construct a line to the Mediterranean, but they have also secured a means of transportino- material, rolling-stock, &amp;c., which will enable them to push on the construction of the me to Bagdad without having to wait for the piercing of the Taurus. Also, although &gt;y the Bagdad Railway Convention it is agreed that the Bagdad-Bussorah section s ia 1 not be exploited until the whole of the trunk line is completed, yet this clause i oes not preclude the building and working of other sections, and there is therefore nothing to prevent the Germans from building and exploiting the whole of the line between Atkina and Bagdad Adana could then be linked, if necessary, with Eregli, when sufficient money had been laid aside from loans and profits on construction of the Bagdad- Adana sections to overcome the difficulties of the mountain range. 5. But, apart from the fact that German ingenuity has suggested a method of era.,mg, if not of solving, the problem of the Cilician Gates, it appears probable from Mr. Mark Sykes Memorandum of the 1st March, IbOli, that German influence and German manipulation of Ottoman finance may enable the Company eventually tosurmount alone the financial difficulties which were at one time held likely to bar *the completion of the line by them without our assistance. On the whole, it seems probable that, if our participation in the scheme is much longer delayed, we shall be unable to rely on the pecuniary embarrassment of the Company as a factor in the situation inducing them to seek our assistance. 6. In the second place, we are disposed to doubt whether our position with reterence to the question of a terminus for the railway is as strong as we were previously inclined to believe. It appears to have been the original intention of the concession- naires that the line should terminate at a port on or near the open sea, and some spot in the neighbourhood of Koweit appeared to be indicated at first as a likely terminus. I he financiers controlling the Syndicate seem, however, to have cast about for the means of making themselves independent of British assistance in the matter, and from the ^report of Captain Mahon, who was specially deputed last year to make an examination of all possible termini, there would appear to be no reason why they should not succeed in attaining their object. Captain Mahon is of opinion that there , aie no engineering difficulties which would prevent Bussorah from beino- made the terminus of the line, and he thinks that it would provide a port capable of accommodating steamers fully equal to the demands of trade for many years to come. He further 1 points out that, from a commercial point of view, Bussorah offers advantages over all possible termini. His opinion as to the feasibility of dredging the bar of the Shatt-el- Arab is supported bv his Excellency the Naval Commander-in-chief and by the officers of the British India Steam Navigation Company who ply in those waters. Mr. Grant Lulls recent report of German attempts to purchase from Persia a Concession for a port and a coaling station at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab is not without significance. We are siill disposed to think that the best terminus is to be found in the neighbour- \ hood of the Khor Abdulla or of Kathama Bay. But we recognize that a suitable port may,^if necessary, be secured at some point less directly subject to British influence. 7. In these circumstances, though our opinion on the subject has not been invited by His Majesty’s Government, we think it desirable that we should place you in possession of our views as to the advantages to be secured by participation in the scheme and as to the dangers to be feared, in the event of the project being completed without reference to British claims. The authoritative statements in regard to the detrimental effects likely to be produced upon British interests by a railway on the alignment proposed, if under the exclusive control of a great military and industrial nation, have been summarized in Part V of Mr. Alwyn Parker’s Memorandum, dated the 10th March, 1906. His Majesty’s Government have no doubt considered these statements and the conclusions arrived at in them, but even at the risk of recapitulatino- arguments with which His Majesty’s Government are already familiar, we think it as well on the present occasion to lay stress on some considerations of both local and general importance, with which the Government of India regard themselves as intimately concerned. J 8. At Bagdad we have had a Resident since 1766. Kerbala and Nejef are annually visited by large numbers ot Indian pilgrims. At Bussorah there is a British Consul, who is charged with the care of British trade, which is represented by 81’Oo per cent, of the shipping coming into the port, and by the Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company, who are the principal carriers of merchandize between Bussorah and Bagdad, and who are subsidized by the Indian Government. At Koweit for some years past we have been steadily endeavouring to consolidate our influence, in anticipation of the day when the port of a trans-continental railway system should be located in this neighbour hood. Lately we have, with the approval of His Majesty's Government, sent a British Political Agent to reside at this port, and have authorized the Sheikh to adopt a distinctive flag. The Bagdad-Khanikiu route is the line by which a very substantial share of British trade with Persia passes. 9. r l he Germans have already clearly shown that they have no intention of confining their energies to the mere construction of a through line of rail. The Convention itself gives them the right to construct a branch* from Sadijeh to Khanikin, to establish f various industries, to construct J quays at the terminal port, to utilize § such natural water-power as may be available, and during construction to run |j steamers on the Tigris. Schemes have also been started by German Commercial Associations for the exploitation of the mineral wealth of the country traversed by the railway. Nor do they intend to restrict their activity to Mesopotamia only. In 1897 they appointed for * Article I. + Article XXII. f Article XXIII. § Article XXV. || Article IX.8 n ,. fir „ t j inie a Consul to reside at Bushire, where their commercial interests arc still of lepiesentation.^ recent i y learnt from Mr. Spring-Rice's Confidential letter No. 21o to Sir E Grey, dated the 28th March, 1906, that there was reason to suppose that the Mission of the newly-appointed German Minister to Persia was not unconnected with a oroiect for iinkin«- up the Bagdad Railway with Persia by means of a road via Khanikm. Mr Spring-Kice pointed out that, in the event of this Concession being granted and in the event 'of the revival of a Concession which the Germans formerly possessed for the construction of a road from Khanikin to Kermanshah, the {y® ni]'rim route to Kerbala, which is the only line in Persia which is certain to pay. vve rive alho learnt that the German Diplomatic Tu^v a M P?,-sm unusual interest in the progress of the boundary dispute between Iurkey^and I trsia an( ] it is obvious that the acquisition by Turkey of a considerable slice or tne mountainous country which bounds Mesopotamia Strom. then the position of the Po.ier holding the plains ot the Euphrates ana i 0 ris.

The arrival ff a German railway at Bussorah, Urn Kasr, in this ouarter must tend to the Germamzation ot the Bagdad and Bussorah Vilaje , the diminution of British prestige and commerce in these provinces, and the disturbance our re^thms wifh the Arab Chiefs on the southern and. western shores of the Gu ; it would react on our position in Persia, and would possibly, it indeed not probably, necessitate a considerable increase to the British naval forces which at present are -t.itioned ni riiesc^aters. of our commercial and politica! position it is difficult to P believe that a trans-conlinental railway terminating on the Gulf would not sooner or later bring with it the construction of fortifications such as those which guarded the maiitime termini of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The manner in which any suc h result would be viewed by His Majesty’s Government has been eleaily indict te&lt; by various formal utterances. In August 1902, at an interview wi wi’th^the I ansdowne informed His Majesty that “our special concern was of course, with the J , i' “T. f r„ , 1 c &lt;‘l n fi,p thTrd olace—I say it without hesitation—we should regard the establishment 1 of a naval base or of a fortified port in the Persian Quit by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all lhe ln ^ ns 6 a c l a nning lf&gt; a wider horizon, it appears to us certain that German statesmen relying on the well-founded belief that the line will prove to be a valuable commercial speculation, intend to use it as a means for the prosecuti.m ot their ambitions in the Near and Middle East. Sir N. O’Conor reported, in his letter to SrLGiej dated the 17th April, 1906, that the President of the Anatolian and Bagdad Railway Companies had succeeded in obtaining a promise from the Sultan of a Concession toi a scheme o i.rigation in the Plain of Konia by draining the marshy area, extending to some 16 POO acres, in the neighbourhood of Karavita, a project which the Germans have had in view for some time past. Other similar schemes may be expected to make their appearance in due coarse. Further, we may take it for granted that the Germans fully realize that the great risk to the future of the line lies m the m.sgovernment and disorder of the districts through which it passes, and they are doubtless prepared to take9 the measures which will be required in order to ensure the maintenance of law and order in those districts. We anticipate that, when once definite construction has commenced, a more or less gradual process of interference by Germany will ensue in the administra tion of those portions of the Turkish Empire through which the railway will pass. In time this process can have but one result, namely, the consolidation of German influence throughout this vast and important territory, and the eventual passing into German hands of all real power in this particular zone. For the maintenance of order local forces, doubtless officered and controlled by Germany at the expense of Turkey, would have to he kept up, and in this connection the political importance of the existing Haidar Pasha- Eregli line merits serious attention. By means of this line the greater part of Anatolia is brought within the German sphere of influence, and the Osmanli inhabitants of this region, who are capable of being converted into fighting material of unrivalled value, would doubtless form the basis of the forces which would be recruited for the purpose of maintaining order. The rapid extension of the Hedjaz Railway, and its linking up with the Bagdad line, would enable the Turkish troops to be concentrated either on the western or easlern frontiers of the Sultan’s dominions, and our position in Egypt and at Aden, and even the Red Sea route to India, would be threatened, while it would be more difficult for the Arabs to make head against the power of the Porte. I*. The Government of India cannot regard with equanimity the possible creation of a situation such as that sketched above. With the concentration of so much power in German hands, and with the shadow of an eventual Russo-German alliance looming in the distance, there would be ground for serious apprehension, and a large increase to the military expenditure of the United Kingdom would be inevitable. 14. These considerations have led us to the opinion that in the interests of India it is necessary that we should no longer confine ourselves to an attitude of passive expecta tion in the hope that the progress of the line may be stopped by natural, political, or financial obstacles; that it is hopeless to attempt to block the scheme by any action within our power; and that it is therefore obligatory to secure such an interest in the undertaking as may minimize the risks of its falling under the control of a single Power, or being utilized as a means of overthrowing our present predominant position in the Gulf and of menacing India. 15. His Majesty’s Government have no doubt already considered in what manner a share in this great enterprise may be secured, if this is still practicable. In time of peace the control of the south-eastern portion of the line would materially add to our prestige in the Gulf. In the event of future war, however, it would certainly not provide us with a guarantee of protection while, on the other hand, there would be nothing to prevent our particular section from being used by their enemies at their will. In our opinion, our interests can be most effectively safeguarded by some arrangement that will enable the British Government to take part in the scheme as a whole. By the adoption of such a course w r e should, among other things, pave the way for the employment of British officers for the maintenance of order, and the pre-eminent faculty which English men possess for the management of Asiatics might be expected soon to secure tor us the predominant share of these duties in the regions traversed by the line. ^ It has been proved again and again that Englishmen can work in climates where Germans can barely exist, and we have the great advantage of being able to draw on India for cheap military material. Ifi. We would therefore, in the event of no decision having as yet been arrived at on the subject of British participation in the railway, venture strongly to recommend that every effort should be made to obtain the largest possible share in the whole project from Eregli onwards. As an alternative, but only in the event of this proving impracti cable, we would advocate that control of the Bagdad-Bussorah Gulf section and of the port upon the Gulf should be secured for the British Government.

THE Under-Secretary of State for India presents his compliments to the Under secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and, by direction of Mr. Secretary Morley, forwards herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State, copy of a Secret despatch to the Government of India, dated the 20th instant, with inclosures, relative to the relative merits of Kurein and Kathama as terminal stations for a railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. India Office, July 31, 1906. Inclosure 1 in No. 4. Mr. Morley to Government of India. (Secret.) My Lord, India Office, July 20, 1906. WITH reference to the letter from the Naval Commander-in-chief on the East Indies Station to the Secretary to your Excellency’s Government in the Foreign Depart ment of the 19th May last, I inclose herewith, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a letter from the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty on the subject of the relative merits of Kurein and Kathama as terminal stations for a railway fro n the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) JOHN MORLEY. Inclosure 2 in No. 4. Admiralty to India Office. Sir, Admiralty, July 11, 1906. I AM commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiraltv to forward here with, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, copy of a letter which has been addressed to the Indian Government by the Commander-in- chief on the East Indies Station, stating his views regarding the possibilities of Kurein and Kathama as terminal stations for a railway from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. 2. Their Lordships’ views are not wholly in accord with those of the Commander- in-chief regarding the hydrographic and commercial considerations involved. Kurein Harbour, as shown in chart No. 3571, possesses the following advantages:— (a.) A wharf 1 mile in length, or a series of smaller w harves of that length, could be constructed, with depths of not less than 25 feet alongside at low water. (b.) A judicious arrangement of beacons wmuld enable a vessel to use a channel to this wharf of a depth of not less than 14 feet of water at low-water springs, of 21 feet at high-water neaps, and 24 feet at high-water springs. (c.) The depth of this channel it would not be difficult to increase to 20 feet at low-water springs, and it is possible even greater depth could be obtained at some cost. (d.) The berths alongside the wharf would be perfectly secure at all times. (e.) A railway could run down to the wharf, and passengers or goods be embarked or disembarked without delay. A rough idea of what is meant is shown on the attached cutting from chart No. 3571.11 3. With regard to Kathama, it is to be observed— (a.) That a depth of 20 feet at low water is about f mile or upwards from the shore ; (b.) That it would he a much more expensive work to construct a wharf, alongside which vessels could moor, at Kathama than at Kurein ; (c.) There would be, however, plenty of room for vessels to anchor in an area of 30 feet depth and upwards at low water, about a mile off shore. 4. The whole tendency of traffic in the present day is to bring vessels alongside wharves or into floating docks, with railway communication alongside, so that tran shipment to small vessels, lighters, or boats is avoided, and it is especially necessary to study the convenience of passengers. 5. The question of the expense of fitting a terminal port for traffic is small in comparison with the expense of a railway, and the advantage of a railway is greatly reduced if a convenient terminal port cannot be constructed. Such a convenient terminal port couid be made at Kurein at probably a very much less cost than at Kathama. 6. In placing the above considerations before the Secretary of State, my Lords do not wish it to be understood that they advocate the construction of a harbour either at Kurein or Kathama at the present moment. This is a question of policy which involves much wider issues. As, however, the subject is engaging the attention of the Government of India, Mr. Morley may think it desirable that they should be in possjssion of the facts set forth above, which are material to a full consideration of the question. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) EVAN MACGREGOR. Inclosure 3 in No. 4. Vice-Admiral Foe to Government of India. f Confidential.) “ Hermes,” at Kurrachee, May 19, 1908. I HAVE the honour to submit the following remarks on the inner harbour at Kurein just to the south-west of Koweit, for the information of his Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General in Council. I did not refer to this matter in my recent report on the Persian Gulf of the 26th ultimo, as I did not attach much importance to it; but, in view of the opinion expressed in paragraph 25 of Confidential Memorandum of information regarding external affairs in the Persian Gulf for the month of March last by the Captain of the R.LM.S. “Investigator,’' “ that the anchorage in question is the real harbour of Koweit, and that the adjacent foreshore would be the proper site for a railway station, shouM a railway ever come to Koweit,” I feel bound to represent that I do not concur in this opinion, for the reasons stated hereafter. 2. The deep-water anchorage off Kurein is shown in our old Admiralty chart, but the recent survey by the “ Investigator ” has increased our knowledge very greatly, and has therefore drawn attention to it. 3. While there is no doubt that at Kurein there is a narrow stretch of deep water and good anchorage carrying an average depth of about 25 feet for a length of about 1 mile (2,000 yards) and of about 21 to 22 feet for a further distance of 3 cables (600 yards), the width of the anchorage between the 3-fathom lines is nowhere more than 2| cables (500 yards), and is more generally only 2 cables (400 yards), and to enter this anchorage there is not more than 13 feet at low water, and that' only in a very narrow channel, and 23 feet at high-water springs, and this channel is nearly a mile (1,800 yards) long. 4. Bearing these facts in mind, and that a railway from Bagdad to Koweit, or any other deep-water terminus in the Persian Gulf, would only be practicable as a commercial transaction if there was a vastly increased amount of produce to be disposed of, and that this could only be the result of a gigantic scheme of irrigation; and, further, considering that, if this vast increase of produce should become °a tact’ small steamers would be of no use to remove it, the whole tendency of the time being12 to run large vessels which are much more economical cargo-carriers than sni a| l oi ' e s, I therefore think it very improbable that the Kurein anchorage would be selected entailinc, as it would, very extensive dredging, the cost of which could estimated until careful borings had been made, and the result being to open up a comparatively small area of water tor large vessels. . . r « P 5. Under these circumstances, and considering that Uiere is a large area of deep water at Duhat Kathama with very easy approach at ail Umes, and that this deep wate is only 1 mile from the shore, I do not think we need consider Kuiem as a proba site for the terminus of the railway. No doubt it is very . t0 ^ Koweit, and the Sheikh would therefore probably favour it and it is, ot course, a possible port for the railway, should it ever become an accomplished tact. 6 The Kurein position is an excellent one for a boat harbour and also lor a vesse of war to anchor and support the defence of Koweit in an attack from the desert, as the “ Perseus 5 ’ class could enter a little before high water, but even a 2nd-class ciuisei, such as the “Hermes,” is debarred from anchoring there, her ordinary draught oi water (23 ft. 6 in.) being too great, even at high-water springs, lor her to enter wi grave risk. _ . 0 &amp; I have, &amp;c. EDMUND S. POE. No. 5. Memorandum communicated to trench and Russian Ambassadors. (ConMenhalO ^ have recent]y had under consideration their future attitude in regard to the Bagdad Railway question, and they consider it desirable in the first instance to communicate their views on the subject to the Irench and Russian Oovernments^t of Great Britain in a railway which, if completed, would form the most direct mail route to India is so evident as to require no demonstration; while the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards any radical disturbance of the status quo in the Persian Gulf has been clearly enunciated in a declaration made by Loid Lansdowne on the 5th May, 1903. . • i ^ But apart from the political aspects of the question, the commercial position of Great Britain in the Mesopotamian delta is altogether exceptional Ihis position has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of t\vo and a halt centuries a^o, of the first English factory at Bussorah ; in 1766 a British Resident was appointed at Bagdad; at Bussorah there has long been a British Consul, charged with the care of British trade, represented by 96 per cent, of the shipping coming into the port, and by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, who are the principal carriers of merchandize between Bussorah and Bagdad, and who are subsidized by tin Government of India for the carriage of mails Such is now the ^^eof these commercial interests that the Bade of Bagdad and Bussorah, valued at 2,o()0,000/. 1903, is predominantly in the hands of British and Indian merchants. Moreover, the annual pilgrimage of British subjects to tbe Shiah shrines is continually increasing, the numbers in 1905 exceeding 11,000. , In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government may justly consider, both on political and commercial grounds, that their attitude towards the Bagdad Railway should not be disregarded by the promoters ol the undertaking. Thev have concluded that this attitude could not be actively favourable unless British participation in the scheme were assured and rendered permanent on equitable terms and they are persuaded that such participation can only be arranged it Great Britain secures the construction and control of the railway from a point north of Bagdad to the Persian Gulf. They are prepared to agree, m regard to traffic rates, &amp;c n to equality of treatment for all countries over the entire railway from sea to sea, but thev could not be a party to the internationalization of the line under a system of kilometric guarantees such as the Concession of 1903 has established. M hatev er may be the financial arrangements in regard to the rest of the line, His Majesty s Govern ment could not, so far as the British portion were concerned, accept responsibility tor a system of which in principle they disapprove. If such conditions of this nature as might prove satisfactory could be arranged, His Majesty’s Government, in order to13 insure their realization and the completion of this part of the railway, would be willing to consider the question of themselves giving a guarantee to enable the necessary British capital to be raised for that portion of the railway in regard to which their control would cover their responsibility. His Majesty’s Government are further of opinion that the predominant position of British trade would justify the concession to British contractors of such harbour works as might be required at Bagdad, Bussorah, and Koweit. The further details of British co-operation, such as adequate representation on the international Board which would regulate such matters as through traffic and equalization of rates, would be the subject of subsequent arrangement. His Majesty’s Government fully realize that the initiation and concession of the railway have been due to German enterprise, and are quite willing to consider favourably any practical suggestion for preserving to the Company its German origin, which would not impair the international character that the administration of the line should, in their opinion, assume from the moment it becomes a sea-to-sea connection, and consequently an important through route to the East. Foreign Office, June 4, 1907. No. 6. Sir Edward Grey to Sir F. Bertie. (No. 332. Confidential.) Sir, Foreign Office, June 5, 1907. I GAVE M. Cambon lo-day, confidentially, a Memorandum, embodying our views with regard to the Pagdad Railway, of which a copy is herewith inclosed.* Having read it, he observed that I had previously told him that control of the southern end of the line was what we should like, but that the Memorandum went a little further than that by saying in effect that we should participate only if we could get this condition. I referred to the words of the Memorandum, and admitted that they were a little more explicit than anything I had previously said. But I pointed out that the whole Memorandum was much more explicit, and that there was a statement about the possibility of a British Government guarantee to insure the making of the Bagdad end, which also went rather further than anything I had previously said. If the making of that end was secured by such a guarantee, it would very much facilitate the raising of the mone} for the other sections of the line. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) EDWARD GREY. No. 7. Foreign Office to India Office. (Confidential.) Sir, Foreign Office, June 12, 1907. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a Memorandum,* which has been communicated to the French and Russian Ambassadors at this Court, on the subject of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in regard to British co-operation in the Bagdid Railway. Jn view of recent developments in this question, I am to suggest, for the ! consideration of Mr. Secretary Morley, that it may now T be expedient to arrive at a decision as to the purchase of a plot of land on the foreshore at Bunder-es-Schwmik, a point 2 cr 3 miles south-w r est of Koweit, which may not improbably be the terminus of the Bagdad Railway on the Persian Gulf. As you are aware, the purchase of the land in question was prop* sed by the Resident ' in the Persian Gulf in a despatch dated the 11th November, 1905, which formed the inclosure in your letter of the 17th January, 1906; but it was eventually dropped owing to the apprehensions of His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that the scheme might arouse Turkish susceptibilities. [818] No. 5. E14 Sir E. Grey would be glad to learn whether, in Mr. Morley’s opinion, this land could, in the event of its acquisition being decided upon, be most conveniently purchased by the Political Agent at Koweit, to be eventually transferred to the Railway Company, or whether it would be more advisable if it were bought by some existing Company, such as the British India Steam Navigation Company. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) L. MALLET. No. 8. India Office to Foreign Office.—{Received July 18.) , Sir, India Office, July 17, 1907. IN reply to Mr. Mallet’s Most Confidential letter of the 12th ultimo, as to the acquisition of a site on the foreshore near the town of Koweit with a view to its possible utilization hereafter as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to inclose, to be laid before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of telegraphic correspondence with the Viceroy on the subject. The price which the Sheikh is said to be likely to expect appears exorbitant, but Mr. Morley would suggest, for Sir E. Grey’s consideration, that the Political Officer should be authorized to continue negotiations for the acquisition of the site, subject to the maximum amiual rent of 15,000 rupeeSi considered sufficient by the Resident in tfin Gulf, which might, as he suggests, be regarded partly as of the nature of a subsidy. It might also be coupled with a condition entitling the British Government to acquire further land adjacent to the site selected, if required hereafter, on favourable terms. The dimensions named in the telegram, viz., 600 ya rds in length by 100 yards in depth, seem hardly sufficient, and it has been suggested that a frontage of 1,800 yards should be acquired with as great a depth as possible. In these circumstances, Tt may be desirable not to insist too strongly on the price to be paid. Should iTdle decided to continue the negotiations, it will be necessary to make sure that the site is acquired under conditions which will preclude other portions of the foreshore suitable for the purposes of the terminus of the railway coming into the possession of other parties. The Treaty of the 23rd January, 1899, with the Sheikh stipulated that he should not without the consent of the British Government receive the Agent or Representative of any foreign Power, or cede, sell, lease, mortgage, or give for occupation, or for any other purpose, any portion of his territory to any foreign Power, or the subject of any foreign Power. The question of the agency by which the land should be acquired might be held over till that of the cost is settled. The suggestion that the Government of India should be instructed to continue the negotiations is made, I am to state, on the condition that half the cost of acquiring the land is borne by British revenues. As regards the proposal to provide the Political Agent with a steam-launch, it seems a question in present circumstances whether the decision of the Lords^Com missioners of the Treasury not to contribute to its cost, conveyed in your letter of the 27th March last, should not be reconsidered.

Koweit foreshore. Cox reported on the 10th February that Mubarak is willing to let us have a strip of foreshore wherever we like to select it, measuring 600 yards in length by 100 yards in depth. This would give us best site in neighbourhood of Shweikh roadstead. Sheikh is willing to sell outright7but would prefer yearly quit-rent. Knox suggests our first offer should be 50,000 rupees as sale price, or 2,400 rupees as quit-rent in alternative. He anticipates, however, that Mubarak will probably demand very much more, as he is quite aware of potential value of land, and may run to demand 2 lakhs down, or 10,000 rupees quit-rent. Cox thinks that we might offer up to 15,000 rupees ^ annually, of which portion might be treated as subsidy. We are willing to pay [ ? price, or annual rent of foreshore subject to maximum of 7,800 rupees, but w^ould of course try to secure better terms. Cox is being consulted on probable attitude of Sheikh towards offer from British India Company to purchase, but our negotiations have been for direct sale or lease. We see no reason why Government of India should not conduct transaction direct. If purchase of lau nch for Political Agent were sanctioned, this would probably facilitate conduct of negotiations, as this is reason hitherto assigned for acquisition of foreshore. No. 9. Foreign Office to India Office. (Immediate and Most Confidential.) Sir, Foreign Office, July 20, 1907. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter on the subject of the acquisition of land near Koweit with a view to its possible utilisation as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway. I am to state, in reply, that Sir E. Grey concurs in the suggestion of Mr. Secretary Morley, that the Political Officer at Koweit should be authorized at once to continue negotiations for the acquisition of the site in question, and he proposes to approach the Treasury at once on the subject. Before doing so, however, he would be glad to be informed whether, in Mr. Morley’s opinion, it would not be advisable to give Captain Knox discretion as to the purchase of the site. If the railway is brought down to the Gulf, the value of the land is likely to rise, and the demands of the Sheikh increase proportionally, and it might be as well to secure the freehold at once. The contract should, as proposed in your letter, include a condition reserving to His Majesty’s Government, on favourable terms, the right of pre-emp tion in regard to any further land, either at El Kathama or Bunder-es-Schweik, if required hereafter. Sir E. Grey further considers that the length of frontage to be acquired should depend on the extent of foreshore suitable for the construction of harbour works, a matter on whfch some uncertainty would seem to prevail, and he would be glad to receive any information which Mr. Morley may be able to obtain on this point without delay. . . .... In view of the recent decision of the Cabinet in regard to British participation in the Bagdad Railway, Sir E. Grey would be prepared to ask the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury to reconsider their decision not to contribute towards the cost of a launch for the Political Agent at Koweit—which would be a convenient pretext for the acquisition of a site on the foreshore—and when the extent of land to be acquired has been ascertained, and the price is definitely fixed, he would be in a position to urge their Lordships to consent to the proposal that half the cost should be borne by Imperial funds.

WITH reference to your letter of the 20th July last, as to the acquisition of land near Koweit with a view to its possible utilization as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Morley to inclose, for the consideration of Secretary Sir E. Grey, a copy of telegrams to and from the Government of India, dated the 23rd July and 27th August respectively, together with certain correspondence received from India in covering letters dated the 11th July and 15th August, 1007, an the letter of the Government of India, dated the 2nd August, 1906, to which re erence is made in their telegram; also of two telegrams from the Government of India, dated It will be seen that Sheikh Mubarak is willing to grant to His Majesty s pre-emption to a further area extending to a distance of 1,000 yards Irom me limits or the British reservation, subject only to the prior rights ofTtbweit subjects. ^ 2. The right of pre-emption, or priority of lease, over the Island of Kurein, and ot priority of lease to Has Kathama and its foreshore^to a limit of 2 nautical miles m any direction, the Sheikh reserving an enclave 600 yard^ in linear length within such A declaration would be included in the draft Concession that the Sheikh will not part with his rights in land to Turkey, or any other Power, without the consent ot the British Government. _ . Mr. Morley would remark, as to these proposals, that the reservation ot enclaves is not wholly free from objection, and may lead to possible future complications ; but the con dition is one to which the sheikh doubtless attaches some importance, and may therefore, perhaps, be accepted by His Majesty’s Government. The terms of the draft Concession do not seem to Mr. Morley to be jirohibitive ; but before putting the matter before his CounciirTh^15ecretary of State would be glad to learn the views of Sir E. Grey. In commenting on the terms of the draft Concession, the Government of India reservation. observed, in their telegram of the 27th August, that they would try to fix the price and •Not printednZ 17 rent for Shweikh (i.e., Kurein) Island and Kathama, in case of their being secured by Government hereafter ; and they further suggested that it might be possible to secure from the Sheikh a right of future pre-emption, at a price fixed now, over Warba Island and the anchorages north and south thereof, with the adjacent foreshores, within a distance of 3 nautical miles, so far as they lie within his territory. In their telegram of the 8th September they recommend that fixing the price as regards Warba Island, and perhaps as regards Kathama also, should be delayed, if necessary, for a supplementary Agreement. Mr. Morley would suggest that, while it would be desirable to ascertain if possible the terms which the Sheikh would be prepared to accept as regards Kurein Island, Kathama, and Warba Island, the signature of the Agreement should not be delayed on that account. As regards Warba Island, how ever, and the adjacent foreshores, the validity of Sheikh Mubarak’s claim is doubtful.* The Government of India state in their telegram tnat Warba Island is part of the Sheikh’s territory ; but before exercising any right of pre-emption further inquiry would be necessary with regard to this. In upholding the claims of the Sbeikh to the Island of Bubyan, no mention has ever been made, so far as Mr. Morley is aware, of the neighbouring Island of Warba as being on the same footing. I am further to ask that Mr. Morley may be favoured with Sir Edward Grey’s views upon the recommendations made in the telegram of the Government of India, dated the 8th September, regarding— 1. Customs. 2. Slaves. 3. Guarantee of internal independence. Sir E. Grey will no doubt consider whether the Lords of the Admiralty should be consulted as to the sites referred to by the Government of India. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) COLIN CAMPBELL.

Knox should continue negotiations for purchase, but amount of land to be acquired need not necessarily be limited to dimensions mentioned, but should depend on extent of foreshore suitable for construction of harbour works, as value of land is likely to rise, and immediate purchase of amount necessary for our ultimate requirements therefore seems expedient. It also seems doubtful whether depth of 100 yards will prove sufficient. Lease, if land is not sold outright, but rented, should be perpetual, and contract should secure to us right of pre-emption on favourable terms of any further land that may be required hereafter either at El Kathama or Bunder-es-Schweik. His Majesty’s Government would be glad of further information as to total extent of foreshore in Koweit territory suitable for construction of harbour works. Foreign Office are prepared to ask Treasury to reconsider their refusal to share cost of l aunc h for Political Agent, and will be in position to propose to Treasury that half the cost of purchase of land should be borne by British revenues when amount to be required and price to be paid have been definitely ascertained. Negotiations with Sheikh in these circumstances need not be governed by maximum price recom mended by Cox, though, of course, every effort must be made to avoid unnecessary cost. * The island is referred to in Major Cox’ letter to the Government of India, dated June 11, 1905, of which a copy was sent to the Foreign Office on July 20, 1905, where the expression is used in reporting a coversation with the Sheikh :— “ Warba Island, which he (the Sheikh) also claims to be his.” See also paragraphs 4 and 5 of Government of India letter of February 4, 1904, sent to Foreign Office on March 3, 1904.

Knox reported, 14th August, that Sheikh was willing to grant us rectangular plot, measuring 3,750 yards along sea face by 300 yards in depth, at Bunder Shweikh, for perpetual rent of 60,000 rupees a-year. Sheikh reserves plot of 150 yards square in centre of our reservation, where he has built small coal-shed near outcrop of rocks shown in chart sent with Foreign Secretary’s letter of 27th July, 1905. Rentgi.es right, without further demand, to all foreshore facing grant, except portion opposite Sheikh’s enclave, to depth of 3 fathoms at lowest spring tides, with full liberty to build or sublet to British or Koweit subjects, and also to construct all works necessary to open passage for steamers from open sea. Koweitis have prior right of pre-emption to area within 1,000 yards of reservation, but. failing them, we secure precedence of all others. We also secure pre-emption, or priority ot lease, to Island ot Kurein, and priority ol lease to Ras Kathama and fore shore there to limit of 2 nautical miles in any direction, but Sheikh reserves enclave 60R yards in linear length within such reservation. Draft of Concession also includes declaraticn dictated by Sheikh that he will not part with rights in land to Turkey or any other Power without consent of British Government. Sheikh subsequently wished inter polation of words restricting operation for period during which he and his children experience British kindness, but Knox hopes to get this condition removed. Sheikh is angry with Turks, and present opportunity very favourable. Knox recommends that offer, which is only open for two months, should be accepted at once, as Sheikh's mood may change. Subject to opinion of Cox, which will be telegraphed, we concur, and ask to be authorized to make best terms we can with Sheikh in general sense of his draft Conces sion, on understanding mentioned in your telegram, that His Majesty’s Government will meet half charge. We would try to fix price and rent for Shweikh Island and Kathama in case we wish to secure these hereafter. We would, however, point out that Conces sion, while securing port of Koweit, does not close Khor A bdul la to foreign enterprise, and the papers sent with Secretary’s letter datedTP7tF~December, 190o, indicate that the possibility of developing a harbour, or even a ship canal, to Bussorah by this route cannot be overlooked. We would draw attention to our despatch of 2nd August, 1906. It might even be possible, now the Sheikh Mubarak appears to be in a reasonable mood, to secure from him a right of future pre-emption, at a price fixed now, over Warba Island and the anchorages north and south of the island, with the adjacent foreshores, within a distance of 3 nautical miles of the island, so far as they lie within his teiritory. With this we should command all possible railway outlets on w'e^tern shore of the head of the Gulf. The possibility of line being taken across Shat-el-Arab to Khormusa is remote. Later telegram from Bushire, 23rd August:— “ r Redbreast ’ has brought further papers from Koweit showing the progress of negotiations. “ Sheikh has given Political Agent written approval of draft Agreement embodying terms already stated, with omission of objectionable interpolation. In return, he requires from Political Agent, on behalf of Government, formal acceptance of terms of lease, guarai tee on the part of Government of his internal independence, and promise not to take customs duties on anything in the land to be rented, and to leave control ot Koweit customs to him. In return for the latter he guarantees to fix custom duties against British subjects on the basis of his present Schedule, such Schedule not to be altered without the consent of Government. Political Agent egrets the introduction of stipulations regarding customs, and proposed to Sheikh to treat this as separate matter, but is now convinced that refusal would rouse suspicion of Sneikh and imperil negotia tions. He also urges inclusion in formal acceptance of assurances of desire of Government to see Sheikh and his heirs strong and independent.” As to proposed guarantee of internal independence, w’e understand Sheikh’s suggestion to be that we shall guarantee not to interfere with his internal autonomy, such guarantee not to affect rights, if any, of Turkey. On such understanding ue sec no objection to proposed guarantee. As regards customs, our latest information is that37 19 Sheikh levies import d tty of 5 per cent, ad valore m on all commodities. We see no primd facie objection to Sheikh’s proposals on this head, but will communicate matured opinion later. As to suggestion by Knox for inclusion of declaration that British Government wishes to sec Sheikh strong and independent, we do not consider any such declaration necessary if Sheikh does not hi ms ell press for it. Inclosure 3 in No. 11. Major Cox to Government of India. Bushire, Februaiy 10, 1907. IN continuation of my telegram dated the 10th October, 1906, 1 have the honour to submit copies of two communications received from the Political Agent, Koweit, in which he reports the progress of his negotiations with Sheikh Mubarak in connection with the acquisition of the foreshore of Bunder Shweikh in Koweit Harbour. 2. Briefly summarized, the purport of these Reports seems to be as follows:— Sheikh Mubarak evinces his readiness to let us have a piece of frontage measuring 1,200 zaras (600 yards approximately) in length wherever we like to select it, and having a depth of 200 zaras back from high-water mark, and carrying with it the disposal of the space between this frontage and the 3-fathom line. It will be seen from the “ Survey of the Port of Koweit,” dated April 1905, issued by the Dehra Dun Survey Office, that this length of foreshore would give us the whole of the valuable rock-fronted strip in the neighbourhood of position (B) shown therein. — * If we attach great importance to the purchase outright of the site selected, Sheikh Mubarak is willing so to part with it, but his inclinations are rather in favour of a yearly “ quit-rent,” by which I understand Major Knox to mean an unalterable amount to be paid by us annually as long as we need the site. In other words, rather than receive a lump sum the Sheikh would prefer that we should recompense him for the transfer of the ground to us by giving him a yearly subsidy. Major Knox suggests that in the first instance we should either make him an offer of quit-rent at the rate of 2 rupees per linear zara (= 2,400 rupees per annum), or, in the alternative of buying the grout.d outright, at 50,000 rupees—about twenty years’ purchase. He anticipates, however, that Sheikh Mubarak may not be satisfied with these terms, and may even endeavour to run the figures up to four times the amounts just mentioned. 3. Sheikh Mubarak, after several times speaking of it in parables, has now specifically raised the question of a subsidy, and referred to his interview with Lord Curzon, and 1 venture to express the opinion that the acquisition of this ground furnishes us with a convenient opening for inaugurating such a subsidy in an indirect way which would give the Turks or others as little ground as possible for suspicion or demur. We might record an agreement to pay Sheikh Mubarak a certain substantial sum as quit-rent for this ground in an ordinary deed of tramfer, and in another subsidiary and secret document we might stipulate that a certain proportion of the sum referred to in the fir-t document was to be considered contingent on the friendly attitude and steadfast adherence of the Sheikh to his Treaty engagements with us. To start with, the offer might be made of 1,250 rupees per mensem, out of which in the subsidiary Agreement it would be stated that the payment of 1,000 rupees per mensem would be subject to the conditions above mentioned. Considering the possibly vital importance which may attach to this piece of foreshore, the figure is inconsiderable, and at the above rates would be the precise amount originally suggested as a suitable subsidy—namely, 15,000 rupees per annum. 4. Upon the general question of our subsidizing Sheikh Mubarak I need hardly .dilate. It was lully discussed by my predecessor in his letter of the 5th ^February, 1904, to your address, pursuant to the visit of his Excellency Lord Curzon to the Persian Gulf, and was subsequently mooted in connection with the proposal to support Sheikh Mubarak in establishing posts on Bubian Island. Possibly it is still under consideration in conjunction with that question. From the point of view of the Government of India’s local representative, I have always been strongly in favour of the grant of a subsidy to Sheikh Mubarak as being a course calculated to strengthen our position with him considerably. It seems to be a20 doubly politic measure at the present epoch when w T e have to contemplate the lively probability both of German efforts for closer relations with Mubarak through the medium of the Hamburg-American Line and of the necessity of inaugurating up-to-date quarantine measures at Koweit, a project which will be one ot no small delicacy, and which it is of the first importance that we should take in hand for him. In making the foregoing observations I should mention that I have had in mind a purely political subsidy. The Government of India must be well aware that any payment intended to be compensatory for loss resulting to Sheikh Mubarak in connection with the suppression of the Arms Traffic would have to be considered on a considerably more liberal scale. 5. In the final paragraph of his last Report the Political Agent suggests that it would be as well for us to refrain from further discussion with fcheikh Mubarak for two or three months ; nevertheless, if His Majesty’s Government are able to come to a provisional decision in the meanwhile as to how far they are prepared to go in the direction under correspondence, I should be glad it we could immediately be put in possession of it in case Sheikh Mubarak should himself return to the question. 6. In conclusion, I trust that the Government of India, in reading the accompani ments to this letter, will consider, as I do, that Major Knox deserves credit for the way in which he is handling the negotiations. Inclosure 4 in No. 11. Major Knox to Major Cox. Koweit, January 21, 1907. I HAVE the honour to inform you that the acquisition of a landing-place near the the harbour at Shweikh has been the subject of conversation at one or two interviews held with the Sheikh of Koweit by me recently, and I found myself compelled to accede to the Sheikh’s request that I should visit the spot with him and point out exactly my requirements. 2. I was fortunately able to give the visit as innocent an aspect as was possible in the circumstances, for Sheikh Mubarak went out on Saturday afternoon to see to some alterations that he is having executed on his new steam-yacht, and I borrowed horses from the Sheikh for myself and my wife, and on our arrival at Shweikh we put off in a small boat and were shown over the yacht by the Sheikh. We all returned together to the shore and walked a few yards westward until we reached the rocks of which I have made mention in previous despatches, and there discussed the proposal. 3. The Sheikh had frequently told me that the Germans had attempted to treat with him for this boat harbour and for Kathama Point; but he added a touch that was new to me, for he said that when the Germans found themselves at the end of their patience, they said that “ The Sultan has given us this, and we will seize it.” 4. The Sheikh expressed a preference for having the measurement in thara’as, of \'hich, approximately, two go to the English yard. I asked that the length measurement should be—along high-w r ater line, 600 thara’as, and back from that 200 thara’as; and that, as regards the sea portion of the Concession, all the coast line in front of our 600 thara’as to the depth of 1 thara at the lowest tide should be included therein. 5. The Sheikh made no objection to all this, but as he made no mention of any price I considered that enough had been done for one day, and left that for further discussion. 6. It will be clear from all the above that the Sheikh will not let the land go for a song, but if he should propose anything which is out of all proportion to the estimate of the launch, I shall point out to him that Government is hardly likely to pay, say, 75,000 rupees for the sake of a wharf for a launch worth 50,000 rupees, and suggest that he ask the large price, and double length and breadth of the Concession, and grant to a depth of 2 fathoms at lowest tides, when I shall be ready to place his proposal befoie you for consideration. 7. As far as I may venture to judge from the Sheikh’s attitude during our negotiations, he is really anxious to complete the bargain, whether on account of the large price he expects he will be able to exact for the Concession, or, taking a larger view, in the hope of binding the English closer to his interests. He has shown by recent questions that he is watching the Bagdad Railway closely, and remarked, with21 evident dissatisfaction, that so far it appears to be wholly in German hands. • A favourite saying of his is that whatever Power holds the line from Bagdad to the sea, that Power will undoubtedly hold all the Arabs, and that the Arabs cannot resist such a Power. Inclosure 5 in No. 11. Major Knox to Major Cox. Koweit, January 27, .1907. I HAVE the honour to invite a reference to the correspondence ending with my Confidential letter dated Koweit the 21st January, on the subject of the acquisition of a landing-place at Shweikh Harbour. 2. To-day I obtained an interview with Sheikh Mubarak, and, after the usual preliminary greetings and coffee, I asked him to let me know what were his wishes as regards the land for which I had asked a Concession from him on the 20th instant. 3. The Sheikh began a long and evidently carefully considered reply. He began by saying that Arab Chiefs, his neighbours—he specially named Bahrein and Muscat—had large and flourishing properties, which if managed carefully and intelligently would assure them large returns; whereas he bad very little revenue to draw on, merely, so he said, his customs dues, which did not bring him in half enough to live on suitably. I naturally did not allude to his Fao date gardens, which would have led him into a dissertation on the Turks and their ways, and the lack of support he receives from the Pritish Government. He pointed out that, as I knew, the duties that hospitality to Arabs and the poor and guests imposed upon him were costly and, owing to his increased prestige, continually increasing. He emphasized the fact that he had been asked by the Germans to give them these lands that we now asked for, and that he had refuse d them; that a Russian Consul had pressed him to allow him to rent a house or grant a piece of land on which to build, and that he had steadily refused until, so he said, the Russian got angry with him. He referred to his Agreement with the British Government, and impressed upon me that, under that Agreement, he was debarred from granting or leasing ground belonging to him to any foreigner. 4. He then said that he had received t ome assurance from his Excellency the late Viceroy, Lord Curzon, when he visited Koweit, that he would endeavour to obtain some allowance for him, but explained that later his Excellency gave up the reins of office and nothing came of it. I did not consider myself justified in making any comment on this assertion, and I imagine that the Sheikh must have alluded to the incident when a sword of honour was presented to him, and he made a somewhat ambiguous query asking what went with the sword. I would ask indulgence for the vagueness of this last explanation, as I write from memory of papers seen by me in the Bushire Confidential Record Office, and relating to his Excellency’s visit to the Gulf. 5. The Sheikh proceeded to say that land was increasing in value, and that his subjects had endeavoured to procure Concessions at both Shw^eikh and Kathama Point in the hope that the railway would some day come and make the land valuable; that he was anxious to assist the British Government in every way, but that he did not like to name any price for the land; that he threw himself on the liberality of Government, and merely asked that they w’ould give him something substantial to assist him in meeting his expenditure, which was beginning to be too large for him to cope with. He would prefer a yearly lease (quit-rent), but would not stand in the way of Govern ment, if they attached great importance to an out-and-out purchase. This last explanation was in reply to a question I threw in. 6. I he Sheikh gave me clearly to understand that what he was looking for was much more in the nature of a subsidy than an actual lease of the ground in question. He also made a personal appeal to me, remarking that he regarded me as a brother, and that we had drunk coffee together for some years now, and that he looked to me to show a tender regard for his interests. I replied that he might rely on my doing the best I could in his interests compatible with my duty towards Government, and that no one realized more than myself how impossible it was for my work to progress unless 1 worked in harmony with him. I trust that it will be clear that I do not note this part of our interview in any wish to exalt the notion of my influence with the Sheikh. * i have been long enough now with Arabs to rate such expressions at their proper value. 1 venture to think that it shows the absence of any pressure put on the Sheikh, and that [818] G22 he is at least as anxious to sell the Concession for a good price, as, so far as my limited purview can presume, the British Government is to obtain it. 7. I went on to say that it was clear that the project had passed some way beyond my capacity to deal with it. The original plan was to make a landing-place tor a launch worth some 50,COO rupees, and that I had reckoned on spending some 10,000 rupees on the entire place, of which a good deal more than half would have been swallowed up in the pier, coal-shed, and quarters. It was evident, however, that the Sheikh wanted something substantial, and he would understand that in that case Government also would require a substantial return. I must therefore ask the Sheikh to double the length and breadth of the Concession, and to allow us full liberty to a depth of 3 fathoms at the lowest tides ; that we should choose the ground where we pleased, subject to the proviso that the rocks already mentioned in previous correspondence should form part of the Concession. T also explained that the sea-front line of the Concession would not follow the high-water line which would leave us at the mercy of every inlet, but that a stick would be planted on the high-water line, at one end and a line 1,200 thara’as long would be stretched to another stick also on the high-water line, and these would form the limits of the Concession. 8. The Sheikh expressed his willingness to accept all or any of these conditions, but would not be induced to name what he would consider a suitable return for the land. He invariably replied that he trusted to the liberality of the Government, and alluded to the friendly relations so fortunately established for many years between Koweit and the British. He referred to an incident of forty years ago and the assistance given by the Sheikh of Koweit and his boats to an old man-of-war called the “ Eiroz,” for which it appears presents were s*ent by the Government of Bombay to the Sheikh of Koweit in reward for his exertions on that occasion. 9. This repoit will perhaps not be complete without some suggestion as to what price would be acceptable to the Sheikh. From the course the negotiations hive taken up to the present, l regret to state that it seems most probable that, to be successful, it must follow the leisurely dignified progress of an Oriental bargain, and we must expect to be raised. I have suggested to the Sheikh that it would simplify matters if the cost were calculated on the 1,200 thara’as of sea-front, the important part of the Concession, and he appeared to accept this principle. The Sheikh evidently expects a large price, and I would suggest that the first offer should be 2 rupees per thara yearly quit-rent, or half a lakh of rupees for an out-and-out purchase. I fear, however, that the purchase money will run to 2 lakhs down or 10,000 rupees yearly quit-rent before the bargain is concluded, and, in spite of the inconveniences of delay, I would suggest, with all deference, that an interval of at least three months be allowed to elapse before the subject is again alluded to, at least on our part. 10. I would like to mention that for the past four months the Sheikh has kept me waiting for permission to conclude a bargain with a merchant named Shahin-bin-Ghamin, relating to the purchase of an inclosure which I require for camel stables. At the close of the interview I made a brief allusion to this matter, and he told me that Shahin would be sent to me to-morrow to conclude the sale, and it will be some indication of the Sheikh’s anxiety to deal in the matter of Shweikh if l am able to report at an early date the acquisition of Shahin’s inclosure. He will oblige me in the hope Fiat I shall treat him well in my recommendations to Government. 11. it only remains to add that throughout this interview the Sheikh and I were alone until just towards the end, when his eldest son, Sheikh Jabir, entered. Nothing of importance passed between us after his entrance, though Sheikh Jabir would be able to conclude that there was some matter of lease or sale to be dhcussed. He may of course, lor all I know, be aware of the whole matter. Inclosure 6 in No. 11. Government of India to Major Cor. (Telegraphic.) July 8, 1907. THE following telegram, dated the 26th June, has been received from Secretary of State :— Purchase of land on foreshore at Koweit. Please see Major Cox’ letter, dated the 9th October, which was forwarded with Secretary’s weekly letter dated the 18th October. How do the negotiations for the purchase stand ? In view of possible23 utilization of the site as a terminus for Bagdad Railway, would it be more convenient for purchase, if decided on, to be made by your Government through Political Agent for eventual transfer to the Railway Company, or by some existing Company such as British India ? How would latter mode of proceeding be viewed by Sheikh ? ” Please telegraph your opinion on the probable attitude of the Sheikh towards the offer made by the British India Company to purchase foreshore. Have you anything to add to the remarks contained in your letter dated the 10th February on the foreshore question ? Inclosure 7 in No. 11. Major Cox to Government of India. Bnshire, July 28, 1907. l^N continuation of the correspondence ending with my letter dated the 10th February, 1907, on the subject of the lease of Bunder Shweikh in Koweit harbour, I have the honour to attach a copy of a letter received from Major Knox, in paragraph 4 of which he repoits that Sheikh Mubarak has already built a coal-shed for himself on part of the site in question. Major Knox, when putting up his last proposals, recommended that three or four months be allowed to lapse before he approached the subject again, but the sequel shows that there are risks attending this course, and I trust that Government will soon place him in a position to resume the negotiations. As regards other sites discussed by the Political Agent, I fear we cannot well do much more than leave the Political Agent to make the best bargain which his own influence and Sheikh Mubarak’s idiosyncrasies render feasible. Inclosure S in No. 11. Major Knox to Major Cox. Koweity June 25, 1907. I HAVE the honour to invite a reference to the Confidential correspondence ending with your office indorsement dated the Kith February, 19u7, on the subject of the ac quisition of a portion of the foreshore of Shweikh anchorage. 2. On the 6th June the Sheikh refused me the lease of a piece of ground outside the town to the south, of which he had practically made me a grant. The measure ments and rent had been agreed upon, and its general position decided upon verbally, and the Sheikh had sent with me his confidential servant Abdulla-bin-Hajri to measure the ground, and boundary pillars had been fixed. All this took place on the 2nd June, and I saw the Sheikh once or twice between that date and the 6th, and the matter was mentioned, but it was only when 1 sent up Mulla Abdulla-bin-Abul Ilahi, my munshi, to ask for the written lease that the Sheikh sent a reply to say that he would like to talk the matter over once again. I went to see him the same afternoon, and he explained that he felt difficulties about what the Bussorah authorities would say when they heard of a grant of land in such a conspicuous position, and he asked me to let him off his promise, and said that he would grant me the garden of Shahin-bin-Ghanim, for which we have been in treaty for ten weary months. He even gratuitously promised to deal gently in the matter of rent. 3. I at once agreed, saying that the last thing I wished was to expose the Sheikh to any persecution or difficulties at the hands of the Bussorah authorities, but I asked him to consider that, if the difficulties in the way of a grant of bare desert land with no conspicuous advantages were so insurmountable, what would the Bussorah authorities say to the grant to the British authorities of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore ? 4. The Sheikh replied that there would be no great difficulty about that, as the sale or lease would be confidential, and that he would explain any works or erections by saying that they were his own for the convenience of his own launch, and informed me that he had already erected a coal-shed on the spot. This was a complete surprise to me, for l had left Bunder Shweikh studiously alone for some time, but I believe l received the shock without flinching, and made no comment upon it. 5. I merely asked the Sheikh that, in consideration of the fact that the grant of the land for camel stables had been made so public, and that men under my orders had24 actually been digging wells upon it, I would only ask him to expedite the lease of Shahin’s garden so as to avoid public comment, both for his sake and for mine. He promised faithfully to send Abdulla-ul-Hajri to measure the garden, and th t the lease should be dispatched to me on Friday evening, the 7th, at the very latest. Abdulla measured the garden all right, but I have not seen a line of the lease, and thought it best to avoid further humiliation by not asking for it. 6. It seemed to me advisable to let the Bunder Shweikh matter rest, and 1 made no official report until I had an opportunity of seeing what the Sheikh had actually done. I made the opportunity for myself last evening, and the Sheikh has erected a substantial stone building on the shore immediately opposite the rocks or coral reef of which such frequent mention is made in the correspondence on the subject. 7. It is impossible to say precisely what explanation Sheikh Mubarak will give of this erection of a new building in the centre of a plot of ground under Treaty. But the most obvious inference from this and many similar instances of “ Brer Rabbit ” diplomacy is that he regards neither verbal nor written promises as binding, whether made to the British Government, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, or to a mere underling like myself. Inclosure 9 in No. 11. Government of India to Mr. Morley. (Secret.) Sir, Simla, August 2, 1906. IN paragraph 3 of our Secret despatch dated the 12th July, 1906, on the subject of the railway to Bagdad and the Persian Gulf, we incidentally referred to the proposals made in our Secret despatch dated the 4th February, 1904, for the vindication of Sheikh Mubarak’s rights to Bubiyan. We have now the honour to address yqu with special reference to the measures that have already been under the consideration of His Majesty’s Government to secure the withdrawal of the Turkish military post on that island. 2. Acting on instructions from His Majesty’s Government, the Ambassador at Con stantinople has from time to time protested to the Porte that the occupation of the island by Turkish troops constitutes a disturbance of the status quo, and is an infringement of the Sheikh of Koweit’s territorial rights. In his telegram to Lord Curzon, dated the 31st May, 1905, your predecessor proposed to take an early opportunity of approaching the Turkish Government again on the subject, and, in the event of an unsatisfactory reply, to consider the possibility of giving active support to the Sheikh of Koweit in establishing a military post on the island. Mr. Brodrick accordingly inquired wffiat support it would be necessary to afford the Sheikh in establishing the post in question. On the 26th June Lord Curzon telegraphed in reply that the Sheikh had welcomed the proposal on condition that the British Government would give him full moral support, would inform the Porte of their recognition of his claim to the island, and would assist him in instituting the post. The Sheikh also stipulated for the permanent maintenance of a Political Agent at Koweit, for the occasional visit there of a British man-of-war, and for the contribution by the British Government of a sum of 500 rupees for the erection of guards’ quarters, and 100 rupees a-month for maintaining the guards. His Majesty’s Government were not prepared, however, to move in the matter at the time, preferring to leave it to Sir N. O’Conor’s discretion to select a suitable opportunity for approaching the Porte, and they decided that the question should be considered by the Defence Committee in connection with that of the Bagdad Railway terminus. 3. As we have not been apprised of any conclusions which may have been arrived at in the matter by the Defence Committee, we have refrained from pressing the subject again on your attention. During our deliberat ons over the Bagdad Railway scheme, however, the necessity for securing in anticipation an effective control over the future terminal port of the line has come prominently under notice. The importance of main taining a hold on Bubiyan was dwelt upon at length in our Secret despatch of the 4th February, 1904, and the conclusions arrived at by Vice-Admiral Sir Edmund S. Poe, K.C.V.O., on the occasion of his recent tour in the Persian Gulf, after a local inspection of Khor Abdulla, fully bear out the views which we have hitherto held. \ They are that, next to the anchorage off Ras Katbama (west-north-west of Koweit), ! Khor Abdulla is the only possible harbour in that region, and that it affords facilities[ 818 ] &lt;/0 25 for wharves, and commands the advantage of a comparatively easy and cheap water- snpply from the Shatt-el-Arab. We therefore again recommend the early adoption of one of the alternative measures proposed in our Secret despatch dated the 4th February, 1904, and reiterated in our Secret despatch dated the 16th March, 1905, before Germany or any of the other Powers participating in the railway scheme acquire vested interest* in the neighbourhood of what may prove to be the site of the future terminal port. 4. Another aspect of the question, to which we attach no little importance, arises out of our relations with the Sheikh of Koweit. We believe that the Sheikh appreciates the value to himself even of our passive friendship, realizing that British interests in the Gulf ’and the fact of his being on good relations with us render him safe from absorption by the Turks. Our negotiations in regard to Bubiyan, however, have naturally led him to expect that sooner or later we should make good his claim to the island, and we have reason to think that the indefinite postponement of action on our part, in face of the continued occupation of the island by the Ottoman troops, has to some extent shaken his faith and rendered him cautious of identifying himself too markedly with us. Indeed, he has never lost an opportunity of representing to our Political officers in the Gulf how ineffective British support has proved to stave off Turkish aggressions on his Fao properties and on Bubiyan ; and it can hardly be doubted that the action which we now recommend would go a long way towards reviving his trust in our policy, and making him more amenable to our advice.

Vice-Admiral Poe to Admiralty. (Confidential.) “ Hermes,” at Bombay, April 26, 1906. I HAVE the honour to submit, for the information of the Lords Commissioners ot the Admiralty, the following remarks on my recent visit to the Persian Gulf. I have thought it better to forward my report in chronological order, alluding to such matters as the Government of India had, in a demi-official letter from Sir Louis Dane, invited my attention as they came under my notice :— Muscat .—Having left Kurrachee on the 19th March, and escorted their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales a short distance to sea, l proceeded to Muscat, where I arrived on the 22nd ultimo, and exchanged visits with His Highness the Sultan, who was most cordial and friendly, presenting me with his photograph and that of his father, the late Sultan Syd Turki-bin-Said. As our conversation had to be carried out through an interpreter, it was difficult to speak of any but mere commonplace topics ; but His Highness seemed impressed and pleased with the recent visit of the “ Hogue, followed so quickly.by that of my flag-ship. My relations with M. Laronce, the French Consul, were also most cordial, and he attended all the small entertainments we were able to have during our stay. Arms Traffic .—The question of the importation of arms came chiefly under my notice, as the English steamer “ Hillerag ” landed a considerable number of rifles and cases of ammunition while I was at Muscat, and I met Arabs in the streets removing these very arms to the 'country, whence, no doubt, such as were not required inland were sent across to the Mekran Coast. It is a little vexatious for this to occur under the very eyes of a naval officer, and for him then to be requested to suggest measures for stopping the traffic and prevent tbe arms being smuggled into India from the Mekran Coast. The most obvious w T ay of stopping this traffic w T ou 1 d appear to be by diplomatic agreement with the French, and by granting the Sultan an annual sum of money to compensate him for the loss of revenue he would sustain were arms prohibited from entry into his territory. This, however, it may not be possible to carry out. While there is little doubt that the presence of a man-of-war at Muscat and its vicinity acts as a deterrent on the evport of arms to the Persian coast, still that, even * ined with the stay of a gun-boat on the Mekran Coast, can never be really efficacious. Our vessels are too large, draw too much w r ater, and are too easily seen, and the moment one of them moves the Arabs are informed of the fact, and if it happens that she moves south, and the coast is left clear to the northward, dhows w r ith arms start. It was reported that when the “Lapwing” went to Sur with Major Grey, soon after I had left Muscat for Bunder Abbas, a cargo of 2,000 to *3,000 rifles went across to the Mekran Coast and were landed. Although it does not follow the chronological sequence of event 4 , I think I had better narrate a conversation I had on this subject with M. Heynssens, the Belgian Custom-house official at Bushire, on the 2nd instant, after dinner at the Residency, Major Cox having told me that I should probably bt' a ble to get M. Heynssens, in whose straightforwardness and good faith he believes, t° ta ^ on this matter. I had no difficulty in bringing it on the tapis, and the views t, ^ at he expressed were that the steam-launches now r being built for the Persian Custon 18 * combined with surveillance on shore, which he proposed to effect by means of a ca** 10 ! corps of officials, would render it so difficult to smuggle arms that the traffic would ! Je killed. He, however, added that as long ago as December he wrote to Tehran asking instructions as to taking delivery of the first‘of these steam Punches, and had also telegraphed more than once, but without obtaining any reply; and also that his difficulties arose because the Persian local officials were no slack. Even it they did hot connive at the importation of arms, some of them would do nothing; and at Bunder Abbas, he told me, it was clearly proved that seventy-one rifles were landed within a very short distance of the town from a small fishing-boat, which had received them from a dhow some miles out. He added: “ Your men-of-war will never stop the traffic, though they may have some effect in frightening people from attempting to land arms in Persia.” I think that above sums up the situation, and that the sooner the steam-launches are turned over to the Belgian officials representing the Persian Customs the better it will be. 1 think, however, that we should do what we can to assist the Persians in checking the import of arms, and I am calling the attention of tht? Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf27 to this matter, who is, however, well awaie of it. I think M. Heynseens’ views are concurred in by the Political Resident in the Gulf and by others, such as Mr. Whitby Smith, who understands the situ ition. 2. Khor Kawi .—I left Muscat on the evening of the 26th ultimo, and proceeded to Khor Kawi, where 1 arrived next day. Khor Kawi is an excellent harbour, and, in my opinion, much the best strategical base for naval purposes, should such a base be required in the future. It is only open to two points of the compass, north to north- north-east, the southern entrance being quite covered by high land, and I do not believe that a “ shamal ” (north-west gale) wonld bring in any heavy sea. The drawback to Khor Kawi lies in the fact that it is very rocky and hilly, there being only two or three small sandy bays where landing can be easily effected, and there is hardly any level ground, and no water, so that it would be very costly T and difficult to establish a dockyard or large camp; but as a base for a fleet to anchor and receiv-e coals and stores, or act as escort to a force of transports, it is very well adapted—indeed, with the exception of Koweit, it is the only harbour in the Persian Gulf that I know of where a large ship can anchor in security close to the shore. No doubt Clarence Strait, west of Bunder Abbas, is a good anchorage, but it is not so well situated as Khor Kawi, which, although there are no lights, presents no difficulty to leaving at night—the “ Hermes” wmnt out in the dark without a moon. Khor Kawi could easily be defended, but I do not think that question is likely to arise in the immediate future. No doubt in summer it would be very hot in the harbour, but not unbearable, as is the case with Malcolm and Elphinstone Inlets. I shall direct the “Sphinx ” to report on this matter if possible this summer. 3. Bunder Abbas.—\ left Khor Kawi at 4 a.m. on the 29tii ultimo, arriving olf Bunder Abbas at 9 30 a.m., where I met the “ Fox.” A telegram arrived soon afterwards Irom Major Cox informing me that the Arabs at Henjam were threatening a disturbance owing to the Persians having started building a custom-house in our Concession, and asking me !o send a ship to warn the Arab Sheikh and to keep the peace. Henjaw. —The “ Foxleft at 2*30 p.m. (having had to raise stec»n) and arri v . at Henjam at 7’80 p.m. I attach copies of the various telegrams which pass ^ ‘tween the Resident and myself and “Fox,” and which speak for themselves. : e tesisit was satisfactory, as the Persians withdrew their men (acting apparently Under enters from Tehran), and all is quiet, but I agreed with the Resident that a ship should remain at Henjam for the present, and I have directed “ Fox” to do so until relieved or un~il the Resident can dispense with tier services. Bunder Abbas. —During my stay at Bunder Abbas I exchanged visits with the Deputy Governor, an insignificant Persian, and saw a good deal of the Political Agent, Lieutenant Shakespeare, but the question of the cable-house having been settled, there was nothing of interest calling for my presence there, and as Major Cox deprecated ms- paying a visit to Henjam at this juncture as being liable to invest the situation there with greater importance than necessary, I decided to leave the matter in the hands of Captain Eustace of the “ Fox.” 4. Bushiie .—I proceeded to Bushire on the 31st ultimo, arriving there on the 1st instant, and found that Mfjor Cox had arranged that the Darya Begi Ahmed Khan should pay me the first visit (the Admiral has heretofore usually- made the first call), which he did on Monday, the 2nd, accompanied by the Karguzar. The Darya Begi was very cordial and attentive, and appeared to be a good class of man ; the Karguzar spoke both French and English, and was a very superior man to find in such a place as Bushire. I understand he is only there temporarily settling some questions. I was very w ell received on my return visit to the Darya Begi, and was escorted out to the Residency by a troop of some sixty irregular horsemen, whose antics were very entertaining, but who were, I should think, of little value as cavalry. The next day 1 met M. Heynssens acd held the conversation re arms, narrated in paragraph 1. During my stay at Bushire the telegrams re Henjam passed, and were all sent in consultation with Mai or Cox. c 5. Bussorah. —After a pleasant stay at Bushire, Major Cox having placed the Royal Indian Mail steamer “Lawrence” at my disposal, l left Bushire in that vessel at 5 p.m. on the bth instant for Bussorah, accompanied by Major Cox (as I was anxious to have the benefit of his knowledge and experience at Koweit and Bahrein), arriving there next day, w r hen l was at once visited by the Turkish Commodore, and on the 7th paid my28 official visit to the Acting Wali of Bussorah, the Wali being at Amara on business of His Majesty the Sultan. The Acting Wali was an effete -and feeble Colonel of artillery, and I was informed by the Consul, Mr. F. E. Crow, that he was of little use in endeavouring to capture the murderers of the late Mr. Glanville (Messrs. Lynch’s Engineer) at Margil, 3 or 4 miles up the river. Mr. Crow also informed me that it was better not to allude to the murder, so my conversation with the Wali was on commonplace matters. Karun River. —Nothing of any moment occurred, but I had some interesting talk with Messrs. Lynch’s representative re the navigation of the Karun River and the prospects of the country around it. He informed me that they send a light-draught steamer up the Karun once a fortnight, but that the navigation is difficult, as the river is very shallow and rocky in parts. He did not seem very sanguine about the development ot Ahwaz, or that the oil-fields in the hills beyond it were likely to prove very lucrative, but he said no one at present knew. I do not think that the Khor Musa has a great future before it, as the country at its head is a large swamp, and it is difficult to land, even in a small boat, owing to the depth of the mud on the banks in most places. 6. Fao. —I left Bussorah on the morning of the 11th, anchoring off Fao to intercept the English mail and to send and receive telegrams, as I was going out of telegraphic touch for a few days to Koweit and Bahrein, and on the 12th proceeded up the Khor Abdulla and spent the day examining it, proceeding up the Khorum Kasr as far as the small Turkish fort, where the boat grounded. Three Turkish soldiers came down from the fort, which is about half-a-mile inland, and asked us what w r e were doing. We said we were looking for snipe ; they then brought their officer or non-commissioned officer near the boat, and as soon as the tide rose we went back down to the Um Kasr Khor and up the Zobeir Khor for 8 or 9 miles, returning to the ship just before dark. The whole of the land on the north side of Khor Abdulla is covered for some miles at high-water springs, and there is no site for docks or wharves without a very heavy expenditure in sea wall and reclamation ; nor is Warbi Island of any use, as it is all practically covered at high water; but on the west side below Um Kasr Fort, although the land is very low, there could be found a site for wharves and a Settlement. The approach, however, to the Khor Abdulla is a long way from the sea—fully 30 miles — and a ship could not count on carrying more than 21 feet at low water, and the channel, though easy of navigation if buoyed, is about 30 miles long. The Khor Abdulla has the advantage of an easy water supply from the Shatt- el-Arab; the distance pipes would have to be carried, being only about 25 to 30 miles, and the sea would always be smooth, so that I see no insuperable difficulty in making a port at the head of the Khor Abdulla, though I think on the whole that Koweit would be the best place for the terminus of the Bagdad Railway, which has been discussed for some time. The Khor Abdulla being occupied by Turkish soldiers leads me to think that the Sultan has this in mind, so as to be independent of Koweit, and I should think it would be difficult for us to prevent him giving a Commercial Concession to make a port there in the future ; the railway could not, however, compete with the water-borne trade in the lower reaches of the Shatt-el-Arab, and would therefore be dependent on the development of the valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris. I see that Commander Kemp suggested that a site marked No. 4 in his confidential plan would be suitable for wharves, &amp;c., but as I 1 ave not that plan I do not know if his view coincides with mine. If, however, his No. 4 position is on the north side of the Khor Abdulla I think he is mistaken, perhaps, having only seen it at neap tides, he may have been misled as to the actual height of the foreshore ; but his No. 4 position may be on the Khor Urn Kasr, and thus agree with my suggested site. 7. Koweit. —I left the Khor Abdulla on the evening of the 13th instant, arriving at Koweit early on the 14th, when Captain Knox visited me and informed me that Sheikh Mubarak was not well, and had had to go out to his country house or camp at Jahara ; however, his eldest son Jabir came out to visit me, and I gave him the honours due to his father, informing him so, but by the advice of the Political Resident and Agent, I did not send an officer of higher rank than my Commander to return the call. Commander Stapleton-Cotton therefore represented me in the afternoon, and was well received. Koweit (Ras Kathama). —The whole behaviour of the Arabs to our officers on shore was most friendly, and they appeared to welcome our presence. As soon as I hadreceived Sheikh Jabir s visit, I went up to Ras Kathama at the head of the bay with Major Cox and mjr Flag Captain and Navigating Officer. We landed close to Ras Kathama, and after wadmg through about 200 yards of mud up to our ankles found (UI selves on sand and mud only, just covered by the highest spring tides for about hm/’ When m e . gr ?.

On the whole, both I and my staff agreed in thinking that the advantage lies with Koweit over Khor Abdulla, but I have no doubt that a fort could be provided on the latter arms of the sea.

As even a ship of the “Perseus” class, drawing 17 feet of water, could only enter at high water with safety, owing to the bar off Kassar Diwan Rock, I attach no importance to it as a naval base. , xv 9 ' “g° od - b ye” to Major Cox and the “Lawrence” on the evening t ,f 1? 16t ^ 1 ^ Ilt, / ^ heil l ll . c burned to Bushire, and I proceeded to Hanjam to meet the Fox, Major Cox being of opin ,,n that, all being now quiet and the Persians having removed from the island, I could go there without detriment. I arrived there at 5-30 p m on the 18th, when Captain Eustace informed me that all was perfectly quiet, and that the Persians were removing all the building materials they had brought across to Kishm. J ° The Arab Sheikh asked if he might see me, and I gave him and four or five of his Headmen an interview, at which Captain Eustace «as present.' The Sheikh thanked me very warmly for the help we had given him, and said he hoped the British would never allow the Persians to rule over him, and that the British were all powerful and could do as they liked. , r I told him that we had done all we could for him and that the matter was now under consideration by the Government, and that when their decision was given he and his men must abide by it, whether it was what they liked or not; that we had to obey orders, and that he must do so also, and that I looked to him to keep his people quiet. F In the afternoon I w^ent down to his village in plain clothes with Captain Eustace of the “ Fox,” and we were v-ry well received, and some of his men accompanied us on our walk back across trie hills. 10. Everytning being very quiet, but the Political Resident having suggested in his telegram of tne 19th Apiil that a ship should not be out of touch of Henjam for lon &lt;v , I directed Captain Eustace not to be absent for more than two or three days at a time unless the “ Sphinx ” or other vessel was in port. I do not anticipate any trouble until after the Arabs leave for the Bahrein pearl fisheries m about six weeks’ time, but it is then possible that the Persians may renew their building operations, and friction will then again occur. Muscat. I left for Muscat on the morning of the 21st, when I arrived early on the 22nd, and met Major Grey, the Politica l Agent. He had no important intelligence, but i nformed me that he had been at Sur once and had sent the “ Lapwing” there a sec-ond time to try and obtain evidence as to the [ 818 ] j30 dhows and their owners under French protection, but that M. Laronce would not a g ree with him as to their number, and that matters were at rather a deadlock. .No doubt a full report will be made by him through the Political Resident. O o * u 12. The “Sphinx” having arrived, I left for Bombay at noon on the 23rd, having received the Government of India’s telegram No. 1640, E.A., just as 1 was starting. In reply thereto, I propose to forward a separate Report on Henjam as soon as TIT*! of 1C&amp; UiG 13. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Government ol India. Inclosure 13 in No. 11. List of Telegrams passed between Commander-in-chief, East Indies, the Commanding Officer His Majesty’s ship “ Fox,” and the Admiralty. (C mfide^tia^ ommander in-chief to Admiralty, the 29th March.—Have arrived at Bunder Abbas. “Fox'’ leaves immediately for Henjam at the request of the British Pendent, Bush ire. Frictions between Arabs and Persians regarding telegraph building. “ box s presence will keep the peace. From Commander-in-chief to Admiralty, the 31st March, “fox remaining at lleniam, where Arabs are excited owing to building of Persian Custom-house having begun, and the} T fear this portends their being under Persian jurisdiction, they claiming to be subjects of the Sultan of Muscat. Arabs number about 500; they are well armed, and may give trouble to Persia. Question has been referred to le ran. “ Lapwing” at Muscat under orders of “ Fox.” Leaving immediately lot Busline. From “Fox” to Commander-in-chief, the 1st April. Sheikh of Hen]am ami principal Arabs visited ship to-day. Gave them Resident s message. Explicitly stated that British Government does not promise them anything, nor will it preserve them fro n the Persians if decision is unfavourable to Arabs. Advised Sheikh to prepare for the worst and accept his fate, should it not be in accordance with his wishes.^ Sheiku states that in this question he has had no advice Lorn Debai or other Arab Sheikhs; he simply states his wishes to the Resident and places Ins case in his hands. He piomises to keep the English informed. From “ Fox” to Commander-in-chief, the fst April.—Shakespear informs me that six tofangchis from Bunder Abbas and four from Kishm have been sent to icndei help. Will probably arrive this evening. Disturbances anticipated to-morrow. 4 Lapwing returns to Muscat; has been ordered to complete with coal and report wiien ready for sea. From “Fox” to Commander-in-chicf, the 3rd April.—Mirza Muhammad Salih is still encamped on shore near Deristan. Warned him that the presence of thirteen armed tofangchis might lead Arabs to attack them, and requested them to withdraw clear of the coast where Arabs from Henjam and Deristan could not surprise them. There are thirty-five Arab dhow T s in Henjam and numerous canoes. \ isited him and explained that ins escort could not land on Henjam; he undertakes to come to Henjam to-morrow without armed followers. From “ Fox ” to Commander-in-chief, the 5th - April.-—Telegraph Kossid from Bunder Abbas state that all available tofangchis in the districts are being sent to reinforce those at Deristan. That M. Stas is collecting troops and arms at Bunder Abbas. Ghomamhossa and Helal from Russian Consulate have joined Mirza Muhammad Salih at Deristan; they have no provisions. Arabs have made no move, but some workmen employed by Persians on their building on our limit fled last n:ght at about 4 p m., these two Russian employes landed in out limits. As they told several lies and had no credentials I have sent them back to Russian Consul tor his authority to represent him in our limits at Henjam, since I declined to be responsible lor lives of Russian employes nominally Persian servants of Sadad-es-Sultaneh, the Russian Consular Assistant at Bunder Abbas. From “ Fox ” to Commander-in-chief, the 5th April.—Sheikh with forty Arabs visited ship, wants reply to former request. Asks if‘attacked by Persian troops or man- of-war will British protect them ? Sheikh skates he has already claimed protection of British, States he will attack Persians if they attempt to land at Henjam Island out of our limits.31 From Commander-in-chief to Admiralty, the 5th April.—Leaving for Bussorah immediately in “Lawrence.” “Hermes” remaining at Bushire until the 9th April. Affairs at Henjam difficult, but “ Fox” able to cope with it for the present. No move ment of Persian gun-boat or troops here. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire agrees with me in thinking that my presence in “ Hermes” at Henjam at the present juncture would give too much importance to the incident. 8hall be in telegraphic communication at Fao and Bussorah to-morrow. I will shorten visit and return to Bushire if affairs become more complicated. It is considered inadvisable to cancel visit to Bussorah unless absolutely necessary. Just received telegram from Tehran stating that British Minister hopes to dissuade Persians from taking coercive measures against Arabs. From Commander-in-chief to “ Fox,” 5th April.—Subject to any pronouncement which Foreign Office may eventually make, Legation, Tehran, has apparently approved of action hitherto taken. The letter telegraphed to Resident yesterday that Foreign a inister had assured him that there was no intention on the p»rt of the Persian Government to coerce Arabs pending settlement of question. It would, therefore, appear improbable that they will attempt to do so. The best course will be to inform the Sheikh again that matter is under discussion, and that until you receive intimation of the decision arrived at, your instructions are to preserve the peace, that is, to prevent Persians from attacking Arabs, or Arabs from molesting Persians. Resident is of this opinion and concurs in this telegram. From “ Foxto Commander-in-chief, 11th April.—Labourers employed building custom-house left for Deristan to-day. Mudir of fvishm and tofangehis withdrew from sca-shore of Deristan this afternoon. From Commander-in-chief to Admiralty, 11th April.—“Fox” telegraphs that Persian labourers employed on building custom-house left for Deristan on the 9th April. Mudir of Kishm and riflemen withdrew from sea-shore of Deristan on the 9th April. Political Resident considers no cause for anxiety at present, but the presence of ship desirable. “ Fox ” remaining at Henjam. Inclosure 11 in No. 11. Government of India to Mr. M or ley. ( Secret.) (Telegraphic. ) • September 8, 1907. KX)VY r ElT foreshore. Following telegram received from Major Cox, dated Shiraz, 3rd September :— “Your telegram of 29th August. “ 1 have asked for full details as to existing Customs Tariff. In the last connection it might perhaps be advisable to ask Sheikh to add that, in settlement of future disputes between his Customs Department and British or foreign subjects, he will be guided, to a reasonable extent, by the friendly advice of British Government or their Repre sentative. “ With reference to proposed guarantee of internal autonomy, it is probable that question of right ot our Representative to manumit fugitive slaves, with or without his concurrence, might become difficult sooner or later. For this reason, while giving guarantee, Government might perhaps consider following alternative courses:— “ 1. Either omit all reference to Slave Trade in the present document, and then a short time afterwards ask Sheikh to conclude Slave Trade Agreement with us ; or “ 2. When giving guarantee, add confident hope that, should it become necessary, Sheikh will conclude such a Convention. “ I should be inclined to trust to his increasing amenableness and adopt first alternative. “ In connection with reference to rights of Turkey, it is not clear whether group No. 233 of telegram under reply should be interpreted ‘affecting’ or ‘hazarding.' In any case, could not all mention of Turkey be avoided? I have not seen written text of draft Agreement, but I gather that Sheikh, in this particular document, only asks us to undertake to respect his internal independence ourselves. I- “ I recommend that, if Political Agent thinks that it is still possible, grant of a right of pre-emption over Warba, &amp;c., as well as Kathama be included in present Agreement, but that, in order not to delay signature, the determination of provisional prices be delayed, if necessary, for a supplementary Agreement. “ Subject to above observations, I respectfully subscribe to the proposals and views advanced by Government of India to Secretary of State for India,” We recommend as follows :— 1. Customs .—We think Sheikh may be expected, without formal Agreement, to be guided to a reasonable extent by our friendly advice in such matters; and as regards foreigners, we have suggested, in despatch posted 5th September, that we should get Sheikh to agree to be guided by our advice in his foreign relations. We would not, therefore, endanger conclusion of lease by putting forward stipulation proposed by Cox. 2. Slaves. —We do not think it advisable to complicate question of lease by raising the question of slaves ; but if it appears at any future time that we can press matter upon the Sheikh’s attention without incurring his resentment, we shall be ready to do so. 3. Guarantee of internal independence. —We had not intended to suggest that there should be any mention in the Agreement of Turkey’s possible rights, but had merely explained that such guarantee need not affect Turkish rights, if any. 4. Warba Island .—We concur in Cox’s recommendation. We have now received draft Agreements from Major Knox, and copies were forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s weekly letter of 5th September.

Effect of this may be transient. ’ P P 7 No. 12. Foreign Office to Treasury. (Most Confidential.) Sir ’ i a n/r j• . j , o . Foreign Office, September 16, 1907. * '. directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state, for the information of the Lords Commissioners ol the Treasury, that, in view of a recent decision of the Cabinet in regard to the future attitude of this country towards the Bagdad Railway question he has been in communication with .the Secretary of State for India respecting ’the advisability of acquiring a portion of the foreshore at Koweit, which is considered to possess capabilities as a harbour forming the terminus of a great railway superior to those of any other port on the Persian Gulf. It is manifest that the possession of the land in question (wh'ch the German Government have already attempted to acquire) would immeasurably strengthen the position of this country in any negotiations which may hereafter take place in regard to British participation in the Bagdad Railway; an undertaking which, if constructed under exclusively German auspices, could not fail to have a prejudicial eftect upon British influence, both political and commercial, in the Middle East. I he interest of Great Britain in a railway which, if completed, would form the inost direct mail route to India is indeed so evident as to require no demonstration. But, apart from the political aspects of the question, the commercial position of Great ntam in the Mesopotamian delta is altogether exceptional. This position has been14 33 steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah; in 1766 a British Resident was appointed at Bagdad; at Bussorah there has long been a British Consul, charged with the care of British trade, represented by 96 per cent, of the shipping coming into the port, and by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, who are the principal carriers of merchandize between Bussorah and Bagdad, and who are subsidized by the Government of India for the carriage of mails. Such is now the nature of these commercial interests that the trade of Bagdad and Bussorah, valued at 2,500,000/. in 1903, is predominantly in the hands of British and Indian merchants. In these circumstances, His Majesty’s Government have decided that every effort must be made to render the co-operation of Great Britain desirable to the promoters of the railway. Preliminary negotiations with the Sheikh of Koweit have shown that he is prepared to agree to the lease of a rectangular plot at Bunder Shweikh, 3,750 yards along the sea face by 300 yards in depth, for a perpetual rent of 4,000 a-year, the Sheikh reserving a plot 150 yards square in the centre of the larger plot. Outside the British reservation above described, His Majesty’s Government would have a right of pre-emption to a further area extending to a distance of 1,000 yards from the limits ot the British reservation, subject only to the prior rights of Koweit subjects. This offer lapses, if not accepted by the 14th October. Sir E. Grey is of opinion that no time should be lost in accepting the terms offered by the Sheikh. It is not considered probable that such advantageous terms are likely to be offered again. In these circumstances, Sir E. Grey trusts that the Lords Commissioners will sanction the grant of a yearly sum of 2,000/., the balance to be paid by the Government of India. He further considers that it is desirable to afford a pretext for the purchase of the land in question by providing the Agent at Koweit with a steam-launch, the reasons for which were fully explained in my letters of the 9th January and 6th March and inclosures. If a launch is provided, it is essential that a coaling-station, to be ocated on the site above mentioned, should be established, since the acquisition of a site by His Majesty’s Government could not otherwise fail to arouse the susceptibilities of other Powers. 1 am therefore to express the hope that the Lords Commissioners will reconsider their decision not to contribute towards the cost of purchase and upkeep of a launch. In conclusion, I am to state that an early decision on the subject of this letter is of great importance. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) L. MALLET. No. 13. Foreign Office to India Office. (Confidential.) Sir, Foreign Office, September 16, 1907. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant respecting the acquisition of land near Koweit with a view to its possible utilization as the terminus of the Bagdad Railway. I am to state, in reply, that it seems important, in the first instance, to secure the v rectangular plot at Bunder-es-Shwaik, as this is apparently the best, if not the only terminus; that a letter,* of which a copy is inclosed, has accordingly been addressed to the Treasury on the subject. I am to suggest that the acquisition of further sites, which in some instances would raise questions of territoriaT Jurisdiction, might be considered at an early date by a Conference of representatives of the India Office, Admiralty, and Foreign Office; that the negotiations respecting Bunder-es-Shwaik need not be delayed until the report of this Conference has been considered, though the Agreement relating to Bunder-es- Shwaik should if possible include a clause reserving to His Majesty’s Government the right of pre-emption in regard to any further sites suitable for a terminus which are or may be within the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Koweit; that the reservation of enclaves is an objection, though not insuperable, and that it must, if inevitable, be admitted. * No. 12. [818] KI am to add that Sir E. Grey concurs in the views of the Government of India as to (1) customs ; (2) slaves; (3) independence; but that the status of Warba Island would be a point for consideration by the proposed Conference. If these views meet with the concurrence of Mr. Secretary Morley, I am to inquire whether your Department would enter forthwith into the necessary communications with the Admiralty, with a view to expedition. A further letter will be addressed to you immediately on receipt of a reply from the Treasury. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) L.
