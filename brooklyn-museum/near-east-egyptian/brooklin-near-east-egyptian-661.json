We cannot know, therefore, whether this striking head, from an over-life-size statue, represented a Greek or a native Egyptian, especially since its striking features are a blend of Egyptian and Greek styles. The short curls, for example, are a simplified rendering of a Greek hairdo, and the large, deep-set eyes derive from images of Alexander the Great. But the facial modeling, with its folds and furrows, has many precedents in Egyptian art, as does the narrow, sharply outlined mouth. We may see here the beginning of a mixed Greco-Egyptian style, which was soon to disappear when the Romans conquered Egypt.<br />", "summary": null, "rank": 0, "label_date": "2008-11-06", "date_added": "2008-11-06 08:35:50", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 751, "title": "Cleopatra's Egypt: Age of the Ptolemies"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 7501644, "name": "Mitrahina, Egypt", "type": "Possible place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "58.30_SL1.jpg", "id": 8484, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/58.30_SL1.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/58.30_SL1.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 74, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 149, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 299, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 599, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 1198, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/58.30_SL1.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Head of an Egyptian Official</em>, ca. 50 B.C.E.
