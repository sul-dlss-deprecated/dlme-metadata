(Corrected up to 1st April 1931.) Introductory. 1. Pile history of Aden, in relation to British India, commences with its capture in 1839 by HAL steamers Vologe and Cruiser, and 700 men of the East India Company’s troops (Bombay Army), and its annexation to the territories then in the possession of the Company, ft was vested in the Crown, as part of India, by the Government of India Act of 1858. Aden Settlement. 2. The Aden Settlement is a small area of British territory situated on the Arabian coast about 100 miles east of the Straits of Bab el Mandeb, of some 75 square miles (excluding Perim). It consists of two old craters forming rocky peninsulas in the south and west, and a flat strip of coast about 3 miles broad, the whole enclosing a bay known as the Aden Back Bay, about 8 miles broad east and west, and 4 miles deep north and south, with an entrance 3 miles across. British territory was formerly limited to the peninsula of Aden proper, extending to Khormaksar. In 1SG8 the island of Sira and the peninsula of Jabal Ilisan or Little Aden were acquired by purchase from the Sultan of Lahej, and in 1882 the flat strip of coast was also purchased. The southern peninsula—Aden proper—has an area of about 21 square miles, and contains the native town of Aden, Steamer Point with a modern anchorage for large vessels, Maala with a dhow anchorage and wharf, and Tawahi. Khormaksar is in the isthmus with the aerodrome and lines of the Royal Air Force to the north. The peninsula on the west—Little Aden—has an area of about 15 square miles, and the flat strip of coast, in which are situated the villages of Sheikh Othman, Hiswa and Imad, has an area of about 39 square miles. A general plan of the Aden Settlement is printed as an p.z. .mo/ai Appendix to the Aden Administration Report for 1930. Perirn, 3. The island of Perim, in the Straits of Bab el Mandeb, at the entrance to the Red Sea, was occupied in 1799, subsequently abandoned, but reoccupied in 1857. It is now attached to the Aden Settlement for administrative purposes. It has an area of about 5 square miles and a population of 2,075, and is a coaling station, cable station and lighthouse point. 4. The territory forming part of Aden was defined by section 2 of the Aden Laws Regulation, 1891. It forms part of the Bombay Presidency as defined in section 3 (7) of the Bombay General Clauses Act, 1904 (Bombay Act No. 1 of 1904). The total population is approximately 53,000. Of these, 31,612 are Arabs and p.z. 3640 / 31 . 5,594 Indians (Census 1921). Aden Protectorate. 5. It very soon became evident that the occupation of Aden itself would be of little use unless a good understanding were arrived at with the neighbouring tribes, and treaties were entered into as occasion offered between His Majesty’s Government and the Arab chiefs of the independent tribes occupying the hinterland. Turkish encroachment along the boundaries of the protected tribes was a constant source of trouble and various agreements were entered into as to the boundary line. These agreements were combined in an agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Turkish Government ratified in March 1914, in which the boundary line of the Protectorate was demarcated. This boundary begins at Ras Turba, on the mainland north-east of Perim, and extends in a north-easterly direction for over 200 miles to a point on the River Bana, near Kataba, excluding, however, the territory of Zuraiki and Kubati. From Kataba, a line drawn north-east from Lakamat A1 Ash’ub to the desert defines the dividing line. In an easterly direction the area extends from this line and along the coast to the borders of Oman. The zone within which British influence is more immediately felt may be said to be the area comprised within the boundary line Ras Turba—Kataba on the west and a line east-south-east from Kataba to the coast, on the east. Beyond this line to the borders of Oman lies the territory known as the Hadrarnaut.G. The territory forming the Protectorate is in the possession of 13 principal tribes. The chiefs who are allowed salutes are the following:—The Abdali, the Fadli, the Kaiti, the Amir of Dhala, and the Sultan of Kishn and Socotra. The first named possesses great influence in the interior and renders valuable assistance to G overnment. 7. Though authority is exercised as Paramount Power in the Protectorate, the policy is one of non-interference with the internal and domestic affairs of the tribes, but the intervention of any other foreign Power is not tolerated. (See also note under “Judicial Assistant,” para. 105.) Sphere of Political Influence. 8. From the north-west of the Ras Turba-Kataba line to the coast to a point about 400 miles north of Perim (Hall Point) are the territories of Yemen and Asir. These were formerly Turkish provinces, but since the war have been governed by their own Arab rulers, the Imam of Sanaa and the Idrisi (of whom the latter has now been absorbed by Ibn Sand). Political influence is exercised in this area from the Residency. (See also para. 147.) Kamaran. 9. The island of Kamaran, situated near the Arabian coast, 200 miles north of Perim, was formerly a Turkish possession, and has been in British occupation since 1915. The island was not expressly mentioned in the Treaty of Lausanne. By Article 16, Turkey renounced “all rights and title whatsoever over or respecting” islands other than those over which her sovereignty was recognised by that Treaty. The renunciation was not, however, in favour of the British or any other specified Government, Article 16 referring to the future of the territories and islands within the scope of the renunciation as “being settled or to be settled, by the parties concerned.” No settlement of the future of Kamaran was effected at the time of the Treaty, and none has been effected since, and its political status remains undefined. It is' at present administered by the Government of India through a Civil Administrator (atpresent Captain G. Wickham, I.A.R.O. Pay Rs. 1,000 100—1,500, T.A. Rs. 75, appointed 14th February 1924), who is under the control of the Resident at Aden. 10. The island has an area of 22 square miles and a population of about 2,200. It contains a Quarantine Station for pilgrims on their way to Mecca from the East, through which about 66,000 pilgrims pass annually, and which, under an Anglo- Dutch Agreement, signed in 1926, is managed jointly by the Government of India and the Government of the Netherlands East Indies. Clause 2 of the Agreement provides that the Civil Administrator appointed by the Government of India shall be Director of the Station and in that capacity shall exercise general supervision and control over the whole staff of the Station ; that he shall be assisted by two Medical Officers, one appointed by the Government of India and the other by the Government of the Netherlands East Indies; and that the Indian and Dutch doctors shall alternate as Chief Medical Officer of the Station. Further, it is agreed that these two Medical Officers shall be on a footing of complete equality. Certain advances were made jointly by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India in respect of a deficit on the working of the Quarantine Station to 31st March 1922. Clauses 7, 8 and 9 of the Agreement and the Protocol to the Agreement set out the manner in which these advances are to be repaid out of the proceeds of the pilgrim dues. 11. The Administrator is invested with the powers of a Magistrate of the 1st Class and administers justice, with the assistance of a Kazi for all cases affected by the Mohammedan laws. Situation prior to Cabinet Decision of December 1926. (a) Period prior to the War. 12. Before the war the Aden Settlement and Protectorate were administered entirely by the Government of Bombay and the Government of India under the ultimate control of the Secretary of State for India. The Government of India was also responsible for the defence of Aden. Civil and military administration was controlled by a Major-General of the Indian Army as Political Resident and General Officer Commanding the Aden Brigade, with the assistance of officers of the Bombay Political Department.5 (b) War Period. 13. Shortly after the outbreak of the war the Government of India assumed control of political relations with the Yemen and Asir as well as with the Protectorate ; Kamaran was added to the civil administration and its safety became an additional military responsibility. 14. In 1917 it was decided to transfer the control of political relations (i.e. primarily relations with the Yemen and Asir, but the arrangement was applied also to political relations with the Protectorate) to the Foreign Office and military control (defence and operations) to the War Office. This arrangement was made to secure co-ordination of political action in the Middle East and unity of control and co-ordination of the military effort there. Local administration remained unchanged. 15. The resulting position was unsatisfactory. No clear line could be drawn between defence and administration or between political and administrative affairs. The Resident was responsible to four separate higher authorities on the subjects coming under his control. Questions of finance and incidence of expenditure outlined in the ensuing paragraph were in an untenable position. 10. Prior to 1900 the whole charge for the administration, civil and military, was borne by Indian revenues. In that year the Welby Commission recorded that, in equity, one half of the military charges should be met by the United Kingdom. In pursuance of this recommendation a contribution of £72,000* was made by the Imperial Government in addition to their bearing half the capital outlay on special defence works. The administrative reorganisation of 1917 referred to in para. 14 above was unaccompanied by any readjustment of financial responsibility. Indian revenues continued to bear the charge for internal administration and the cost of the pre-war strength of the garrison at current rates (subject to the contribution of £72,000), while the cost of additional forces maintained at Aden was shared equally between India and His Majesty’s Government. (c) 1919-26. 17. In 1921 a Committee, appointed by the Cabinet under the chairmanship of Sir James Masterton-Smith, presented a report, which resulted in the formation of a Middle East Department within the Colonial Office, and which recommended the transfer of the administration of Aden to the Colonial Office, with, however, no proposals in regard to expenditure. 18. This recommendation was approved by the Cabinet, subject to the approval of the Government of India. The Government of India, after considering the Committee’s recommendations, were prepared to agree to the transfer of Aden to the Imperial Government and to make a contribution of £100,000 per annum from Indian revenues, subject to His Majesty’s Government undertaking responsibility for all charges connected with Aden. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, however, suggested an Indian contribution of £500,000, but ultimately a Colonial Office proposal that India should pay Rs. 50 lakhs a year was officially telegraphed to the Government of India, this amount to be open to reconsideration after five years. The Government of India were unable to accept this proposal. Various discussions subsequently took place on alternative proposals, but it was not found possible to arrive at a solution. In the meantime Indian sentiment, at first indifferent to the question, definitely hardened against the relinquishment of Aden. Finally, the basis of a settlement, which, whilst meeting the essential needs of Imperial policy and strategy, would not be unacceptable to Indian opinion, was arrived at and submitted to the Cabinet in a joint memorandum by the Secretaries of State for the Colonies, War and India (C.P. 414/26). Cabinet Decision of December 1926. 19. The Memorandum was considered by the Cabinet at a meeting held on the 16th December 1926, when, after considerable discussion, the Cabinet agreed: — “ (a) To approve the proposals of the Secretaries of State for the Colonies, War and India, in regard to the responsibility of the administration of Aden, the principal features of which are set forth in paragraphs 11, 12 and 16 of C.P. 414 (26) in the following terms :— “ ‘ 11. ... that a single chief authority should be appointed in control at Aden by the Imperial Government, with the concurrence of the- * The contribution by His Majesty’s Government was nominally £100,000, but of this amount £28,000 was a contribution towards the cost of the India Office.6 C.O. to A.M. 21 Jan. 1928, C. 69264/28, No. 17.

Government of India, in the shape of a Political Resident, or Governor, preferably a civilian. r Ihe Governor, who would have with him a military officer to command and administer the troops, should be responsible to the Imperial Government in all political and military matters, and to the Government of India only for the internal municipal administration of the Settlement of Aden, which would continue on the same basis as if the Settlement had remained part of British India. The Governor should have the titular rank of Comrnander-iu-Chief, as is customary elsewhere, it being understood that the possession of this title will not confer on him any right to give executive orders to the troops. The Officer Commanding the Troops should be appointed by the War Office after consultation with the Colonial Office. He should communicate direct with the War Office on questions of intelligence, training and preparation for war, as well as on matters affecting the routine administration of the troops. We recommend that this arrangement should take effect from 1st April 1927 as regards finance, and as regards administration as soon after that date as practicable. “‘12. This arrangement would secure Imperial control in all essential matters, but leave India the satisfaction of retaining Aden as part of India and still controlling the civil affairs of the Settlement, including its resident Indian population. In view of this we consider that India should be prepared to contribute towards the military and political charges a sum of £250,000 a year for three years, and after that £150,000 a year, or one-third of any total cost (including the cost of any Air Force units at Aden) whichever is the lesser figure. “ ‘ 16. \\ e consider that the responsibility for the political and military administration of Aden should be vested primarily in the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and that Imperial expenditure in connection with Aden should be borne on the Middle Eastern Vote. The military expenditure will in the first instance be borne by the War Office, subject to reimbursement from the Middle Eastern Vote.’ ” (The Chancellor of the Exchequer demurred from this decision of principle being taken before it was known whether the two inquiries referred to below will achieve compensating economies in expenditure from British funds.) “ (b) That the Lord Chancellor should arbitrate on the claim of the War Office set forth in C.P. 414 (26), para. 15, that from the date on which the new increases to Imperial charges come into force (1st April 1927) the payment to India of a subsidy of £130,000 for sea transport out of Army Funds should be discontinued. “ (c) That the Committee of Chiefs of Staff should be instructed that the Cabinet desire that the defence of Aden should be reduced to a less costly basis, and should be asked to advise the Committee of Imperial Defence as to whether this can be effected without undue risks by an addition at Aden of a squadron of the Royal Air Force, combined with the withdrawal and disbandment of the British Infantry Battalion at present stationed there, or by any other means.” 20. It was decided early in 1928 that the responsibility for the defence organisation at Aden should be transferred from the War Office to the Air Ministry, and a Royal Air Force officer was appointed in April 1928 to assume the command and administration of the troops in the garrison. 21. During the following year steps were taken to implement the Cabinet decision by correspondence between the India Office and the Colonial Office, but little material result was attained, and in January 1928 a Standing Committee, consisting of representatives of the Colonial Office, India Office, Air Ministry and Treasury, was formed to make definite recommendations for giving effect to the decision. The Committee was under the Chairmanship of Mr. A. J. Harding, C.M.G., C.B.E., Assistant Secretary in the Middle East Department of the Colonial Office, wdio was succeeded by Mr. H. R. Cowell, C.M.G., in October 1928. Mr. J. G. Laithwaite was appointed as the permanent representative of the Secretary of State for India on the Committee.22. Hie conditions of appointment, &amp;e. of the personnel for the future administra- tion of Aden, Kamanin, lolice, Ac. were discussed at these meetings and resulting therefrom the arrangements detailed in this memorandum have now been made. Administrative Arrangements. The Resident. Title. 23* fhe hist point foi immediate consideration by the Standing Aden Committee was to determine by what means and on what conditions of service the Resident or Governor was to be appointed. The title of the principal officer of the Settlement whilst the administration was controlled by the Government of India and the post was held by a Major-General of the Indian Army had been Political Resident and General Officer Commanding. In view of the delegation of executive authority in regard to military affairs the title of General Officer Commanding was considered unsuitable. A preference was expressed by the Colonial Office that the officer should be known as the Governor, but in view of the fact that he is subordinate to the Governor of Pom bay in civil affairs this title was not acceptable to the Government of India or to the Secretary of State for India. It was finally agreed that the officer should in future be styled Resident and Commander-in-Chief, Aden. Position and Duties. 21. The Resident is the single and supreme authority responsible to, and representative of, His Majesty in Aden. He is responsible to the Imperial Government in all political and military matters through the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and to the Government of Bombay for the internal administration of the Settlement. The question of the transfer of direct control of the Civil Administration from the Government of Bombay to the Government of India is under consideration. In matters of military responsibility the power is delegated to the Air Officer Commanding, who is directly responsible to the Air Council and who deals with all questions of^ policy and major questions of administration of the militaiy foices at Aden. I he general relations of the Air Officer Commanding to the Resident follow the lines of Colonial Regulations 4 to 9, 198 and 199. 25. It was agreed that the Resident should occupy in relation to His Majesty’s Government the position of an ordinary Colonial Governor, and that in respect of those matters remaining under'Indian control his position should be generally assimilated to that of the Commissioner in Sind in relation to the Government of Bombay. 26. The Resident is responsible to the Secretary of State for the Colonies for political relations with the Arab chiefs in the Protectorate and in the conduct of relations with the local potentates outside the Protectorate. In this work he is assisted by the Protectorate Secretary (para. 85) and Political Officers (para. 110). 27. The administration of Civil and Criminal Justice is vested in the Court of the Resident by Bombay Act II of 1864, as amended by Act VI of 1927. The Resident is Chief Judge and Sessions Judge, but the exercise of jurisdiction is, in general, delegated to the Judicial Assistant (para. 104). In the internal administration of the Settlement the Resident is a Commissioner of Excise, Salt, Revenue and Income Tax, and is responsible for the revenue collection. The municipal admini stration of Aden is carried out by the Executive Committee of the Aden Settlement, subject to the authority of the Resident under the powers vested in him by the Aden Settlement Regulation No. VII of 1900 as amended by Regulation No. V of 1919 and 1927. The Committee is under the chairmanship of an officer of the Bombay Public V oiks Department, who is also Chairman of the Board of Trustees constituted under the Aden Port Trust Act V ol 1888 for the administration of the Port of Aden. 4’he Settlement Committee and the Port Trust have separate budgets. 28. In addition the Resident is responsible for the administration of the islands of Perim, Kamaran, and Hodeidah. Method and Conditions of Appointment. 29. By agreement between the Secretaries of State for India and the Colonies the post of Resident will be filled, normally, but not inevitably, by the selection of officers from the Colonial and Indian Services in alternation.

Should two consecutive Residents be appointed from the same Service, the prior claim to the ensuing vacancy will fall to the other Service. The nominee from either Service is subject to the approval of both Governments. 30. The appointment is made by His Majesty the King on the recommendation of His Majesty’s Government, and with the concurrence of the Government of India. The submission to the King will he made by the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The letter of appointment will emanate from the Colonial Office, but the Gazette Notification will appear in the Gazette of India. Arrangements will be made to ensure simultaneous Press publication in this country, in India, and in Aden in the terms “ H.M. the King has been pleased to approve, &amp;c.” No mention of the advisory Secretary of State will be made. 31. The first Resident under the new regime, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir G. Stewart Symes, K.B.E., C.M.G., D.S.0.,' :i -‘ was received in audience by His Majesty the King prior to taking up his appointment. 32. It was agreed (at the 12th meeting of the Standing Aden Committee) that the conditions generally under which the Resident served should be the conditions appertaining to the service to which he belonged, whether he was appointed by His -Majesty's Government or by the Government of India. Pay. 33. The Political Resident and General Officer Commanding under the adminis tration of the Government of India had received pay at the rate of Rs. 3,000 per mensem with a sumptuary allowance of Rs. 500 per mensem, and was liable for payments of approximate!j 7 Rs. 84 per mensem house rent, Rs. 4 per mensem sanitary tax, and Rs. 80 per mensem for electric light up to 200 units per mensem and at current rates thereafter. He was provided with a residence, but the furnishing (see para. 53) was his own responsibility. Colonial Service Resident. 34. The post under the new regime was classified by the Colonial Office as a Third Class Governorship, and the pay of the appointment was fixed, in consultation with the Treasury, at Rs. 30,000 (£2,250) per annum, with an entertainment allowance of Rs. 6,000 (£450) per annum. Indian Service Resident. 35. The Government of India, in agreement with the Government of Bombay, recommended that the pay for an Indian Service officer appointed to the post should be that of a Resident of the Second Class in the Indian Political Department, viz. Rs. 3,000 per mensem plus overseas pay £13 6s. Sd. per mensem with a sumptuary allowance of Rs. 500 per mensem (converted at Is. 6d. = £2,700 per annum, pins £160 overseas pay and sumptuary allowance of £450). These recom mendations were accepted by the Secretary of State for India and His Majesty’s Government. 36. Pay, sumptuary allowance, and travelling allowances are shared equally between Home and Indian revenues, irrespective of the Service from which the Resident is drawn. The entertainment or sumptuary allowance is transferable to the officer acting as Resident in the absence of the Resident on leave, &amp;e. 37. Residents from either Service are now exempted from the payment of house rent, lighting and sanitary charges.t * * Sir Stewart Symes was succeeded as Resident, on his appointment in March 1931 to be Governor of Tanganyika, by Lieutenant-Colonel B. R. Reilly, C.I.E., O.B.E., Indian Political Department (formerly First Assistant Resident, Aden). t The exemption from lighting charges was subsequently detined as extending to 200 units per mensem only, and any additional units consumed over and above that figure must be paid for by the Resident. The lighting of the guard bouse outside the Residency, hitherto included in the charges for lighting the Residency, became a public charge with the cost of lighting the Residency office and other public buildings.0 Passage and Voyage Pay. 38. Irom the 1st iVpril 1927 all expenditure upon the Resident’s passage to and from Aden and upon his pay during the voyage when proceeding to take up his appointment is borne by Imperial or Indian revenues according as the Resident is appointed from the Colonial or Indian Service.* Ike pay of the Resident (appointed from either Service) during the return voyage on relinquishment of the appointment and during final leave is shared equally between British and Indian funds. 39. A Colonial Service Resident receives a passage allowance of £250 plus a temporary post-war addition of 50 per cent., which is subject to review every year. The allowance is intended to cover the cost of the Resident’s passage, and the passages of his family and personal staff, and to reimburse him to some extent for the cost of his outfit. The same amount is granted to him on retiring at the expiration of his term of office or on being transferred to another appointment if his return to the United Kingdom is unavoidable or in furtherance of the public interest (Colonial Regulations, No. /1). In the event of his proceeding on leave of absence, or on being relieved at his own request before the expiration of his term of office, he is required to provide his own passage. 40. An Indian Service Resident is entitled to travelling allowance at transfer rates and pay during transit to and from Aden, under the Fundamental Rules. In the event of an Indian Service Resident drawing on his Lee Concession Passage Account on proceeding on leave, no contribution is levied upon His Majesty’s Government. Leave and Leave Allowances. 41. The leave salary of an officer holding the appointment of Resident in respect of leave earned by his service as Resident is shared equally between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India without any question of leave contribution being introduced.f 42. Ihe leave terms of an Indian Service Resident are as laid down in the Fundamental Rules. 43. The leave terms of a Colonial Service Resident are as follows:—After every tour of service (normally 12-15 months), leave for the time necessarily taken on the journey to the United Kingdom plus 3-|- days for each complete calendar month of service and, if specially detained on public grounds after the completion of a tour of 15 months, 34 da} r s more in respect of each completed calendar month he may have been detained. In the case of a Resident returning to Aden there may be added to his vacation leave a further period of leave of 3|- days for each completed calendar month of residential service plus the time necessarily taken on the voyage back to Aden. The above leave will be on full pay excluding the Entertainment or Sumptuary Allowance (see para. 35 above). Arrangements during Leave Vacancies, &amp;c. 44. In the absence of the Resident on leave, Ac., his duties are performed by the First Assistant Resident. In the event of tiie Resident and First Assistant being both absent on leave or incapacitated, the duties of Resident are discharged by the Protectorate Secretary. An allowance is payable to the officer acting as Resident. Pension. 45. It was decided that each Government should be wholly responsible for all expenditure of whatever sort in connection with the pension of an officer found from their Service, and that neither the Government of India nor His Majesty’s Government should pay any pension contribution to the other in respect of officers holding the appointment of Resident. 46. The cost of the pension provisions for a Resident drawn from outside the Indian Services is not to be included in the total cost of Aden for the purposes * This arrangement is in supersession of decisions that the cost of passage, &amp;c., should be shared equally and was made owing to the wide divergence between Indian and Colonial Regulations. | Some difficulty may arise in regard to this in the event of a Resident proceeding to take up another appointment prior to the expiration of his teuuxe and not taking the leave earned whilst Resident, on vacating the appointment. 140 B P. 4700/30.

An Indian Service Resident has no claim to any Pension or additional pension from Imperial revenues and the converse applies in the case of an officer appointed from outside the Indian Service. 48. An amendment has been made to the Pensions (Governors of Dominions. &amp;c.) Acts to include Aden, to provide for Colonial Service Residents. 49. Under Article 475 b, C.S.R. the appointment will qualify an Indian Service incumbent who is a Military Political Officer for the lower grade of additional pension. Uniform. 50. Indian Political Uniform as prescribed for second-class Residents in the Indian Political Department (Class II) is worn by the Resident whether appointed from the Indian or Colonial Service. Precedence. 51. The Resident ranks in Article 13 of the Indian Warrant of Precedence within his charge and in Article 24 without. Tenure. 52. The tenure of the appointment is the normal term for Indian Governors, viz. five years (including such leave as is admissible) for Residents from either service. The age limits laid down in the Fundamental Rules for compulsory retirement do not apply in the case of Indian Service Residents. Those limits will, however, be strictly adhered to in all normal circumstances. Equipment of the Residency. 53. Prior to 1927 no furniture was provided for the Residency by Government. Furniture was hired from a local firm at a monthly rental and passed on from Resident to Resident. The question of equipping the Residency in accordance with Colonial practice, at Government expense, was considered, and it was decided that the Residency should be furnished and equipped on the scale shown in paras. 359 to 364 of Colonial Regulations. The cost of the equipment, which amounted to slightly less than £3,000, was 4 shared equally between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. 0 54. Pending the arrival of the new furniture, &amp;c., the Resident continued to hire furniture, &amp;c., and the cost of the hire was also shared in moieties. Motor-car and Motor-car Allowance. 55. The Resident and General Officer Commanding had been provided with a car at the expense of the Government of India, in respect of which he received a maintenance allowance of Rs. 3,000 per annum. The car was reported by the first Resident under the new regime to be unserviceable. With the approval of the Government of India and the Colonial Office a 20-h.p. 4-cylinder Austin saloon was purchased at a total cost of £430, one half of which was accepted as a charge on Imperial revenues. 56. It was agreed that the allowance of Rs. 3,000 per annum should be continued and should be shared equally between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. Aide-de-Camp and Private Secretary to the Resident. Conditions of Appointment. 57. The appointment of Aide-de-Camp under Indian administration, when the Resident w T as invariably a Major-General of the Indian Army, w^as usually held by an officer of the Indian Army. As the Aide-de-Camp is a personal officer of the * * At. the time the arrangement was made para. 389 Colonial Regulations provided that a yearly rental should he paid by the Resident for furniture provided for personal use, but this paragraph was subsequently cancelled.11 Resident it was considered undesirable to fetter the choice of the Resident under the new regime or to require that the officer should be drawn from the Indian Services. Accordingly the Resident may select his Aide-de-Camp from whatever service he desires, subject to the observance of regulations in regard to secondment, &amp;c., and to the approval of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. It has been agreed that a civilian may be appointed, and Sir Stewart Symes’ Aide-de-Camp was a civilian who had not previously held any official appointment. P. 5658/28. I.O. to C.O. 22 Oct. 1928, P. 6285/30. Title. 58. The question of the continued suitability of the title Aide-de-Camp, in view of the fact that the Resident is no longer General Officer Commanding and that the appointment of a civilian was in contemplation, came up for consideration, and it was decided to alter the title to “ Aide-de-Camp and Private Secretary to the Resident.” The War Office have intimated that there is no objection to a civilian holder of the post being styled Aide-de-Camp. Pay. 59. An officer of the fndian Army appointed as Aide-de-Camp to the Resident and General Officer Commanding received the scale of pay for this appointment as determined in Army Instruction (India) No. 1—S/1925, as follows :— Appointment held by Lieutenant. Unmarried : Pay of appointment Lodging allowance Married: Pay of appointment Lodging allowance Marriage allowance Rs. - 705 - 25 per mensem. - 705 „ 50 „ - G5 „ 5? Above the rank of Lieutenant. Pay and allowances of rank, including Indian Army allowance plus additional pay of Rs. 100 per mensem. A Captain would thus receive: unmarried, Rs. 860 per mensem ; married, Rs. 995. Rates of lodging allowance are admissible irrespective of whether the holders are provided with free quarters. 60. With the concurrence of the Treasury it has been agreed that the pay of an p .3290 29 . c.o. to Indian Army officer on the Active List holding the appointment of Aide-de-Camp and ^ 1929 ’ Private Secretary should continue to be so determined. 61. Apart from this, no alteration shall be made in the emoluments of the Aide- p. 3351 / 28 . c.o. to de-Camp without the prior consent of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Treasury, 59274 / 28 . 62. The pay of an Aide-de-Camp and Private Secretary to an Imperial Service Resident (not being an Indian Army officer on the Active List) has been fixed by the P. 3207 / 28 , c.o. to Colonial Office, with Treasury and India Office agreement, at the rate of Rs. 6,81)0 per 1928 ’ annum. 63. In the event of an Indian Service Resident wishing to employ an officer who is no longer serving, or who is not a soldier, it may be necessary to fix an ad hoc rate.‘ ;:: ' Incidence of Pay. 64.

In the case of Captain Ropner leave was granted on the basis of 1/11th rounded upwards by a few days to two months and subsequently, in view of his appointment as Assistant Superintendent of Police, extended to l/7th. 68. In both cases the leave pay is borne by the ollicer’s Government, the liability of the other Government being liquidated by payment of the appropriate contribution or by payment of one half of actuals. Uniform. 69. A military officer wears the uniform of his rank. A civilian wears the uniform of a Government of India civil officer in civil employment of the 5th class. Tenure. 70. The appointment is made personally by the Resident, and can be terminated by him at any time. Stenographer. 71. Much additional work was entailed to the Resident and his Assistants through inability to obtain or train a clerk locally as a competent Stenographer-Typist, in Knglish. The proposal of the Resident to create the appointment of a Stenographer for the Residency Office on terms sufficiently generous to attract a technically qualified and thoroughly trustworthy Indian or Goanese was approved, and, with the agreement of the Colonial Office, sanction was given for the creation of the appointment on the following terms : — 72. Pay. —Rs. 200—10—300 per mensem. House rent allowance. —Rs. 30 per mensem. Passage. —Free passages for the officer and his family— (a) on joining appointment, (b) once in four years, or when going on leave on medical certilicate. Pension. —On the recommendation of the Resident the post has been made permanent and pensionable, and payment of appropriate pension contribution is made by His Majesty’s Government. Incidence. —The cost of this appointment is shared equally between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. Superior Administrative Staff. 73. Appointed under the Resident, as chief executive officer, there are three Assistant Residents. The first and third are officers of the Indian Political Department and are responsible for settlement work. The second is appointed by the Colonial Office and is the Protectorate Secretary. He is assisted by Political Officers and the Officer Commanding Levies. Judicial work is performed by a Judicial Assistant, who is a member of the Indian Civil Service. The police are under the control of an officer of the ludian Police Service. First Assistant Resident. Method of Appointment, Position and Duties. 74. The First Assistant Resident is invariably drawn from the Indian Political Department. He assists the Resident in the general administration of the civil and municipal affairs of the Settlement, and discharges the duties of Resident when the Resident is absent on leave or incapacitated. He is the District Magistrate and Additional Sessions Judge. 75. While discharging civil duties only, and having no political responsibility, the First Assistant Resident is entitled to see all political files after action has been taken on them, and, as a general rule and as far as is conveniently practicable.N 0 13 * &lt;» receives information copies of political papers in advance of the files in order that he may be adequately acquainted with the Protectorate and other political affairs with which he may have to deal when required to act as Resident. &lt;(&gt;. It has been agreed, however, that, in practice, papers on Protectorate affairs p. 6767/28. Desp. shall be passed through the First Assistant Resident, on the understanding that it is recognised in principle that the Protectorate Secretary is responsible to the Resident 14 Dec. 1928 .* direct and not to the First Assistant Resident. 11 . In the absence of the hirst Assistant Resident on leave, &amp;c., his duties are normally performed by the Third Assistant Resident. Pay and Allowances. 78. The basic pay admissible for this appointment is the time-scale pay of the officer in the Indian Political Department, including appropriate overseas pav. The liist incumbent under the new regime (Lieut.-Col. 11. R. Reilly) was at the maximum of the scale, viz. Rs. 2,250 per mensem plus sterling overseas pay £30 per mensem. 79. In addition, certain local allowances are admissible (Lieut.-Col. Reilly received special pay of Rs. 150 per mensem and a convejuince allowance of Rs. 50 per mensem). He also drew an allowance of Rs. 30 per mensem which has been sanctioned for the Political Officer who may be required, on public grounds, by the Resident to reside at Steamer Point. 80.

The present incumbent is Mr. R. S. Champion, who has been seconded from the Palestine Government Service. His duties comprise the whole of the political work involved in the Protectorate, relations with the tribal chiefs therein, and relations with the Imam of Sanaa and Ibn Sand so far as they affect the Aden Protectorate. The Protectorate Secretary is responsible to the Resident direct and not through the First Assistant. The Protectorate Secretary, as Second Assistant Resident, is a Justice of the Peace within the Aden Protectorate under the provision made by the Governor-General in Council in Orders dated 1st February 1907, which provide in Part II, para. 3 :— The Political Resident and Assistant Residents for the time being at Aden are hereby appointed to be Justices of the Peace within the Aden Protectorate.” For.

Administration of Justice. (A) In the Settlement. 103. The administration of civil and criminal justice is vested in the Court of the Resident by Bombay Act II of ISGd, as amended by Act VI of 1927. A Judicial Assistant was appointed in April 1927. The functions exercised by him and the details of the reorganisation of the judicial system at Aden which culminated in his appointment are given in the following paragraphs. The Resident and the Judicial Assistant hear appeals from the decisions of Assistant Magistrates and Magistrates of the first class, and have also powers of revision. The First Assistant Resident is a District Magistrate. The Registrar of the Court, who is generally a first-class Magistrate, is invested with the powers of a Judge of Small Causes up to the value of Rs. 500. There are Magisterial Courts at Crater, the Steamer Point and Sheikh Othman. The Government Agent, Perirn, exercises the powers of a second-class Magistrate. Position and Duties of Judicial Assistant. 104. During the years 1925-7 a reorganisation of the judicial system at Aden was effected under which a Judicial Assistant was appointed in the place of an Assistant Resident. The Resident retains his powers as Chief Judge to hear appeals in suits and as Sessions Judge in criminal cases, but is permitted to delegate these powers to the Judicial Assistant in all cases except those which he considers it desirable to reserve or transfer to himself for decision. The Court of the Judicial Assistant is the Court of Appeal and revision in all civil cases tried by the lower Courts, and the Court of First Instance in all cases in which the subject-matter in dispute is of the value of Rs. 500 or over. The Judicial Assistant also prepares cases for reference to the High Court of Bombay. On the criminal side the Judicial Assistant has taken over the duties of Additional Sessions Judge, previously performed by the First Assistant Resident, and hears all criminal appeals and applications for revision. 105. The Judicial Assistant advises the Resident on all legal matters affecting Aden, the Settlement, and the Protectorate, but such assistance can only lie afforded without prejudice to his judicial capacit} 7 . Subject to the same limitation, his assistance on legal matters is also available for the Air Officer Commanding whenever required. He is also the Commissioner for Workmen’s Compensation. (B) In the Protectorate. 100. The exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction in the Protectorate has not been thoroughly formulated or defined. The legal position, generally, is that the Crown has acquired jurisdiction over British subjects, and in some cases over Warrant, 9 April 1930. P.Z. 3640/31. P. 2696/26.

By section 2 of that Act, where a foreign country is not subject to any Government from whom the Crown might obtain jurisdiction on any of the above-mentioned ways, jurisdiction has been conferred upon the Crown over British subjects for the time being resident in or resorting to that country. The jurisdiction so vested is exercised by means of courts established in the foreign countries by Order in Council. Important provisions of the Act are as follows :— (1) Power to send persons charged with offences for trial to a British Possession. (2) Provision as to place of punishment of persons convicted. (3) Power to assign jurisdiction to British Courts. Specific powers are conferred and provisions made by Order in Council. An Order in Council entitled the Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council was issued in 1902, under which various orders in respect of jurisdiction in the Aden Protectorate have been issued by the Governor-General in Council from time to time. 107. The Acts in force in the Aden Protectorate are:— (1) Indian Penal Code XLV of 1860. (2) Indian Code of Criminal Procedure V of 1898. (3) Frontier Murderous Outrages Regulation (IV 7 of 1901). (4) Aden Arms (Sea Traffic) Regulation, 1910. (5) The Indian (Foreign Jurisdiction) Order in Council, 1902. (6) Certain orders under the Sea Customs Act. Certain modifications of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as applicable in the Protectorate, are made, and the Courts are expressly allowed a certain unusual but limited freedom as regards construction of the provisions of any enactment. The Resident and the First Assistant Resident may exercise the powers of District Magistrate and Sessions Judges within the Protectorate, and the Resident and all his Assistants are Justices of the Peace. Warrant dated 0 April 1930. (C) Method of Appointment of Judicial Assistant. 108. The Judicial Assistant is appointed from the Indian Civil Service and is normally about in the middle of his service. Pay and Allowances and Incidence. 109. The basic rate of pay is the time-scale pay of the officer in the Indian Civil Service, including appropriate overseas pay. In addition, judicial pay at the rate of Rs. 150 per mensem and a local allowance of Rs. 200—50—300 per mensem are admissible. The pay and allowances are wholly chargeable to Indian revenues.

There is at present only one Political Officer (Lieut.-Col. M. C. Lake), who is seconded from the Indian Army for a period of five years or until he can retire from the Indian Army on full pension. His emoluments, pension contribution, travelling expenses, Ac., are borne entirely on United Kingdom Funds :— Pay - - - - Local allowance, not payable during absence on leave Personal allowance Consolidated travelling allow ance, not payable during absence on leave Car allowance, during absence on leave - £900 p a. £180 p.a. f £180 p.a. J £225 p.a. £5 a month. { Subject to United Kingdom Income Tax. He also received on appointment an outfit allowance of £82. The leave and passage grants of the post are the same as those of the Second Assistant Resident (paras. 88 and 89).Police and Police Arrangements. 112. At the date of the Cabinet decision (see para. 19) the garrison at Aden, excluding technical troops, consisted of one Indian battalion, one British battalion and an Indian unit raised specially (from India) for service in Aden, known as the Aden Troop. These units were responsible for the defence of Aden and the islands of Perim and Kamaran. On the transfer of control to the Air Ministry, that Department took immediate steps to dispense with these troops, undertaking to discharge the defence responsibilities hitherto borne by the battalions at Aden by— (a) Aeroplanes ; (b) Armoured cars; (c) Tribal levies for employment in the Aden Protectorate from which they were to be raised ; (d) Armed police raised locally to be employed in the Aden Settlement, in Perim and Kamaran. 113. The Aden Police, under the control of a Deputy Superintendent of the Bombay Provincial Police Department, were not organised, armed, nor trained for dealing with any local disturbances of internal security. The existence of the British and Indian battalions was of sufficient moral effect to prevent any troubles and the battalions formed an efficient backing in reserve for the Aden Police. The removal of the battalions consequently necessitated an improvement in the organisation of the existing Police Force. In addition, this Force needed bringing up to strength and a certain amount of reorganisation to enable it to perform the ordinary civil duties of the police. Consequent on the decision in para. 112 (&lt;I) above it was necessary to raise a force of armed police which could provide the moral support hitherto provided by the battalions. 114. After much discussion two police officers, Mr. F. W. Gerrard, C.I.E., and Mr. P. B. Wilkins, M.C., D.F.C., of the Indian Police Service, were detailed by the Government of India and the Government of Bombay to proceed to Aden to study the reorganisation of the civil police at Aden, and to examine further the scheme for the recruitment of armed x^olice. Reports were submitted on the Gth and 13th July 1928. 115. The reports recommended that the force should be organised as a whole under a District Superintendent of Police and an Assistant Superintendent, to replace the Assistant Resident at present in charge of the police and the Deputy Superintendent in immediate charge. The establishment considered necessary was :— British officers - o Armed police - - 254 Inspectors - - 14 Constables - - - 292 Jamadars - - 4 Clerks - - 13 116. The proposals were generally acceptable to the Governments concerned. It was, however, ultimately decided to limit the armed police to 2u(J in the ranks, while the Government of India’s concurrence in their recruitment locally was subject to the reservation that this should be regarded as an experiment. Pending the recruit ment locally and training of the armed police it was decided to employ an interim force of 100 armed police (subsequently increased to 115 to provide a reserve), recruited from India and the disbanded Aden Troop. This force was not to be withdrawn until it was clear that the locally raised armed police were really efficient and capable of carrying out the duties entrusted to them. Sanction has been given for the continuance of the interim force until December 1931. The whole cost of this force is borne by Ilis Majesty’s Government. The recruitment and training of the locally raised force of armed police is now proceeding. A Superintendent for the combined force, who is also in charge of the temporary force of 100, and an Assistant Superintendent for the armed police have been posted, and the conditions of appoint ment, Ac., of these officers are detailed below. The post of Deputy Superintendent has been abolished and the last incumbent has retired. 140 C P. r»816/30. P.Z. 342/31. l.O. to C.O. 27 Jan. 1931.18 P. 1401/29.

Considerable discussion took place on the incidence of the cost of the police arrangements. The Air Ministry and the Colonial Office were of opinion that expenditure on the police was a civil charge and was therefore not apportionable. lo this view the Secretary of State lor India and the Government of India were uuabie to agree, and it was maintained that India could not be expected to bear any expenditure additional to that regarded as necessary to bring the civil police to a reasonable level of efficiency. Ultimately a compromise was effected under which His Majesty s Government are to contribute £5,000 per annum towards the cost of the new force, this payment to be outside the existing financial arrangements, with an additional Uo,00() per annum in respect of the policing of Kamaran. The remaining recurring expenditure is shared between the Government of India and the Government of Bombay. Iwo additional platoons of levies are also at present maintained by His Majesty’s Government, one on the mainland as a military backing for the police, and the other at Kamaran, where, however, it will be replaced by police in or about September 1931, and will then be disbanded. This compromise was subject to the leservation b} the Government of India that it would be open to revision “ if local iecruitment, wdiich is the basis of the present-calculations, should prove a failure, and recruitment in India became necessary with a corresponding increase of cost.” he cost of the new buildings and equipment required for the permanent Aden I ohce Force will be shared between His Majesty’s Government and the Government (d India in the same proportion as the recurrent expenditure, subject, so far as equipment is concerned, to credit being afforded to His Majesty’s Government for any serviceable equipment transferred from the temporary armed force. Superintendent and Commandant of Police. -p .1^' was agreed that the Superintendent of Police should invariably be a uitish officei of the Indian Police Service. A Superintendent was accordingly appointed from the_ Indian Police Service to take command of the interim armed police and to supervise the arrangements for the reorganisation of the unarmed police and the recruitment, training, &amp;c., of the permanent armed police. He arrived in Aden in .November 1928. The. interim police came into being on 9th January 1929, and arrangements for the recruitment and training of the permanent armed police and the reorganisation of the ordinary police are proceeding. 120. Ihe Superintendent is in sole charge of the Aden Police Force, armed and unaimed, subject to the administrative control of the Resident, and has full powers or appointment, promotion and dismissal. He is responsible for the training- discipline and working of the Force and the control of the detachment of armed police in Fermi and Kamaran. Pay and Allowances. 12J. Time-scale pay and overseas pay in the Indian Police Service. (The present incumbent is now m receipt of Rs. 1,000 per mensem plus £30 per mensem overseas pay.) Special Aden allowance Rs. 200 per mensem. Conveyance allowance Rs 160 per mensem.' 1 ' Incidence. 122. During the interim period half the cost of the Superintendent’s pay whilst he has been in charge of the interim armed police, has been borne by the Government ot India. Alter the transition period the cost of the appointment will be included in Me serieral police charges, towards which His Majesty’s Government will contribute AbJXJU as above. Leave. 123.

This post is^ on the normal establishment of the police. Its incumbent, who will be a British olhcer, has been appointed for the command of the armed police and to assist in their recruitment and training. Difficulty was experienced in finding a suitable officer of the Indian Police who could speak Arabic, and although when the new force is firmly established this may matter less, it was considered that in the case ol the officer appointed to recruit and train the raw material, drawn from primitive and undisciplined Arab stocks, knowledge of Arabs and their language in addition to qualities of leadership and knowledge of police duties and training, was essential. Efforts were also made to secure a suitable officer from the Iraq or Palestine Police, but without success, and ultimately the appointment was offered to, and accepted bv, Captain Ropner, formerly Aide-de-Camp to the Resident, on the following terms.

Miscellaneous and Subordinate Staff. 133. Under the Cabinet decision provision was made for an annual lump sum contribution by the Government of India to the military and political expenditure on Aden. Civil and municipal expenditure and receipts continued to be defrayed by and accrue to the Government of Bombay. It was recognised, however, that certain items of expenditure might be partly civil and partly political. The amounts involved were, in the main, small, but it was found necessary to consider each item in detail. Definite allocation of posts between political and civil, in particular in regard to the clerical and menial establishment, was not considered practicable, and was, moreover, regarded as undesirable, owing to the tendency which would arise for the administrative machinery to be broken up into compartments, instead of working as a whole, were such a division carried out. The expenditure incurred was accordingly analysed and apportioned between Imperial and Indian revenues. 134. The apportionment has been under consideration since the Cabinet decision, and the basis of allocation has now been agreed between the India Office and the Colonial Office with Treasury approval. The present arrangement is to be adhered to for three years to 31st March 1933, and will be subject thereafter to review at V. 6143/30. I.o. to G. of 1. 13 Nov. 1930.

In the event, however, of alteration of policy, the arrangement will be liable for reconsideration, if desirable. For the three years 1st April 1927 to 31st March 1930, settlement of the claim has been made on a basis not materially different from that now agreed upon and detailed below. 135. Authority has been given to the Government of India to sanction increases in the divisible expenditure within a limit of 15 per cent, without reference to His Majesty’s Government. 136. Political entertainment charges, territorial and political pensions, and Durbar presents are met by the Colonial Office. 4* * Details of remaining Items of Divisible Expenditure. „ ^ (1) Assistant Resident, Perim. 137. Prior to the replacement of the garrison at Perim by a detachment of armed police (Police Arrangements, para. Ill) the duties of Assistant Resident, Perim, were carried out by the officer commanding the troops there. Consequent on the withdrawal of the troops, temporary arrangements have been made for the civil duties to be carried out by the manager of the Perim Coal Company, who is paid Rs. 500 per mensem. He acts as Government Agent to receive and transmit receipts from port dues and the post arid excise office, and makes the necessary payments to the lighthouse staff, police and local pensioners.

Whilst an officer is on leave and is drawing the pay of his appointment, the allocation of the pay of the substantive post of the acting officer is not to be altered, but any additional allowance granted to the acting officer will be allocated on the same basis as the pay of the officer on leave. Liability to British Income Tax of Officers serving at Aden. 145. The Board of Inland Revenue originally ruled that the Resident and those officers of his staff whose salaries are paid wholly from British funds or towards whose salaries a contribution is made from British funds, were liable to assessment to British Income Tax on the amounts so paid or contributed. The liability of the Protectorate Secretary and the Political Officers to such assessment was not disputed, and it was agreed that the Resident and his Aide-de-Camp are liable in respect of the moiety of their emoluments paid from British funds. The question of the liability of the Superintendent of Police, Civil Surgeon and the Superintendent of the Residency Office, and also of the locally employed staff (in those cases in which His Majesty’s Govern men t make a contribution to the Government of India of a proportion of their emoluments), was the subject of considerable discussion between the Colonial Office and the Board. Ultimately it was agreed that no liability to British Income Tax should attach to the salaries of the personnel in question on the grounds that, although a definite contribution was made from British funds towards the salaries, the payments were, in effect, generally in respect of services rendered by the civil administration to His Majesty’s Government and that the conditions of service, &amp;c., are determined entirely by the Government of India. 146. The Board of Inland Revenue also agreed not to press the question of the liability of Indian Service officers in respect of additional allowances received when acting for Colonial Service officers on leave, or of the liability of the Resident for the year 1927-8 and of the officer who acted as Protectorate Secretary pending the arrival of the officer appointed by the Colonial Office. Aden Levies. 147. A Local Defence Force (referred to at (c) of para. 111), styled the Aden Protectorate Levies,was formed in 1928 and consisted of Headquarters and 4 platoons of a strength of 2 British Officers, 4 Native Warrant Officers and 150 other ranks, together with 20 followers. The addition of 2 platoons, making 6 in all, has been made to the force and the strength has been increased to 3 British Officers, 2 British Non-commissioned Officers, 231 Native Officers and other ranks and 34 followers, with animal and mechanical transport. The force is under the administrative control of the Air Ministry and the cost is borne entirely on United Kingdom funds (Colonial and Middle Eastern Services Vote—Class H, 9). A.G. 8319/30.

Ihe cost of this force is borne entirely by His Majesty’s Government (on Air Ministry votes) subject to a contribution from the Government of India, referred to in para. 19 (12). , Political Department, India Office, April 1931. R. E. FRANCE.23 f * &gt; * APPENDIX. Memorandum drawn up by the Colonial Office dealing with the Financial Arrangements relating to Charges against the Funds of the United Kingdom. TL (bee paras. 12 to U.) of the Main Notes for greater detail.) Prior to 1st April 11)27, Aden was administered by the Government of India and the cost of adminis tration and the cost of the garrison with the exception of the cost of the Royal Air Force was borne by the Government of India subject to a financial contribution by the Government of the United Kingdom. Since 1914 this contribution consisted of (1) a fixed sum ol ,£100,000 per annum, and (2) a moiety of the charge for troops in excess of the pre-war garrison. As from 1st April 1927 responsibility for the political and military administration was vested in the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the civil administration of Aden remaining under the control of the Government of India. The Government of India contributed £250,000 per annum towards the cost of the political and military services in Aden for three years from 1927, and the whole of the £250,000 was appropriated in aid of the votes on which the defence expenditure was borne. As from 1930 the contribution was fixed at £150,000 per annum or one-third of the total cost borne on United Kingdom, funds (whichever was the less), excluding the cost of the Resident’s pension, the United Kingdom contribution towards the cost of the local police force and the cost of the mission at Jlodeidah. In 1927, the total cost of expenditure on Aden borne on United Kingdom funds, including defence expenditure, was provided for under subhead L of the Vote for Middle Eastern Services (Class II, 10) and the contribution from the Government of India (£250,000) was brought to account under subhead M (Appropriations-in-Aid) of the same Vote. From 1928 onwards the cost of defence expenditure (apart from the cost of a small local force) has been borne on Army and Air Votes and the United Kingdom Government’s share of the cost of the civil expenditure in connection with the Protectorate and the cost of the local force has been borne on the Aden subhead of the Vote for Colonial and Middle Eastern Services (Class 11, 9). 2. The United Kingdom share of the Aden expenditure, apart from expenditure on the Royal Air Force, which is borne on Air Ministry Votes, can conveniently be shown as follows :— (1) Contribution to Government of India in respect of the Civil Services connected with the Protectorate. The expenditure on the above Civil Services is met in the first case by the Government of India, and a claim is submitted quarterly to the Colonial Office for the agreed United Kingdom share of the expenditure. No supporting vouchers are forwarded, but the claim is certified by the Accountant-General, Bombay, who is responsible for the local .audit of Aden expenditure. The agreed United Kingdom share of the expenditure for the three years 1st April 1930 to 31st March 1933 is referred to in para. 133 of the Main Notes. (2) Contribution to Government of India in respect of whole cost of a temporary armed Police Force of 100 Indians ('plus a reserve of 15 men) pending reorganisation of the permanent Police Force. (See para. 115 of Main Notes.) The cost is met in the first case from Indian revenues, and a claim for the whole cost unsupported by vouchers but certified by the Accountant- General, Bombay, is forwarded quarterly to the Colonial Office, and when agreed is set off against funds advanced by the Colonial Office to the India Office. (3) Contribution to Government of India in respect of the reorganised Police Force (see para. 117 of Main Notes). No contribution has yet been paid, pending the completion of the reorganisation of the permanent Police Force. The full contribution when payable has been fixed at £8,000 per annum and when due will be paid over by* the Colonial Office to the India Office in such instalments as may be decided upon. See para. and footnote.(4) Cost of wholly political services, including cost of Mission at Hocleidah. (a^i Second Assistant Resident and Protectorate Secretary. (b) Political Officer. (c) Pension contributions of (a) and (b). (d) Cost of leave passages of (a) and (h). (e) Expenditure on Protectorate Chiefs and other miscellaneous expenditure. (/) Cost of Mission at Hodeidah. (g) Miscellaneous expenditure. The salary of the present Second Assistant Resident is, for his convenience, issued by the Colonial Office direct to his bankers in the United Kingdom. Certain expenditure under (6) (c), (d), (e) and (g) above is also occasionally paid in the first place by the Colonial Office, but generally the expenditure is incurred by the Resident in Aden from Indian Government funds in his hands and accounted for direct to the Colonial Office with supporting vouchers. After examination so much of the expenditure as is allowed as being in order is notified to the India Office as having been accepted by the Colonial Office and is set off against the advances which the Colonial Office has made to the India Office in respect of Aden expenditure. As the expenditure under this head is wholly chargeable to the Government of the United Kingdom it was found more convenient that the Resident should account for it direct to the Colonial Office rather than to the Government of Bombay. (5) Cost of the Tribal Levies. (See para. 1IG of Main Notes.) These Levies are administered by the Air Ministry on behalf of the Colonial Office. The cost is wholly chargeable to the Government of the United Kingdom, and is met from the Aden subhead of the Vote for Colonial and Middle Eastern Services (Class II, 9). The Colonial Office makes quarterly advances to the Air Ministry on account of the estimated expenditure, and the Air Ministry Accounting Officer certifies as to the actual expenditure on the force after the close of the year. No details of the expenditure are given by the Air Ministry. 3. The Colonial Office makes advances from time to time to the India Office in respect of (1), (2) and (-1) referred to in para. 2, and the relative claims are received in the Colonial Office and are checked, and the India Office is thereafter notified that the whole (or part) of the amount of the claim is admitted and can be set off against the advances already made. In certain exceptional circumstances (e.g. purchase of furniture for Residency) the expenditure has been incurred in the first case bv the Colonial Office and the Government of India’s share has been debited to the India Office and treated as an advance on account of further expenditure debitable to United Kingdom funds.
