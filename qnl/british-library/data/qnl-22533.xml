Sir, Being given to understand that Khan Sahib Grhiasuddin Attache, Foreign Department, Simla, is shortly going on 4 months leave, I 'beg to apply for the appointment for the period of the leave-vacancy and beg to lay the following facts before you for your kind and sympathetic consideration: I have rendered nearly 20 years' service in this department of vhidh nearly 14i years have been spent in the Persian G-ulf where myself and family have always suffered from the effects of bad climate. In addition, my children have been badly handicapped in their education which could not properly be carried on in the G-ulf for utter lack of schools and cannot be sufficiently well looked after in the case of my three boys who are now schooling in India. My fourth son will soon be of a school-going age and it will be another terrible ordeal for him and the mother if he is sent away to India. My two girls aged 10 and 8 years are also wasting their precious time here with no means of education available, nor can they be separated from their mother. I am too heavily burdened with family to allow of my keeping up two separate establishments were I to leave the fajnily in India and remain out here, and, in any case, such a contingency presents no small difficulty and has been tried and found to be a positive hardship and a fruitful source of endless cares and worries. All these circumstances have been represented from timer V u time to time to your predecessors, both verbally and in writ/ing, and they have all expressed their sympathy and lent their kind support to my request to be transferred j to India, both as an urgently needed relief and a reisard for meritorious services rendered under trying circumstances&lt; to.k)d I also had the honour of waiting on the Hon f ble the Foreign Secretary Sir Denys Bray when last in India and he, too, was pleased to express his sympathy with my peculiar difficulties and to give me some hope of transfer to India whenever a suitable chance occurred* I now earnestly bag that my humble request may kindly be supported and fofwarded to (xoveroinent for favourable consideration in order that I may kindly be given this chance which, thou^i temporary, may enable me later on to obtain permanent employ ment in India# In case Grovemment were to consider it an expensive arrangement for a leave vacancy, I should be willing to bear my own travelling expenses to join the appointment.

In any case I feel like a man who is condemned before heing heard. Hon^/of my written represantations and statements of my hard circumstances of a peculiar nature, has so far been before the Foreign Department, and when I waited on the Foreign Secretary in February 1928, he seemed to know nothing of my case. I would, therefore, earnestly request that my application dated Elst July 1928 be sent with your forwarding letter and such recoafaendation as Political Resident may be good enough to make in support, so that GoTemment may consider ay case as a whole and I may be either given an appointment in India or allowed to retire, ^ I am unable to remain on in the &amp;ulf in the face of my difficuties of my own health and that of the family and the loss of Education suffered by the children and other material losses.

To The Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to forward, for the favourable consideration of the Hon^le the Political Resident, a representation which I have received from Khan Bahadur Sayyid Siddiq Hasan. 2. The Khan Bahadur has stated the facts clearly and I have little to add to them. The post of Indian Assistant at Bahrain is undoubtedly the most arduous of the Vernacular Branch gazetted posts, and has hitherto been considered the most senior. Such a post would, in India, be filled in by a well paid extra Assistant Commissioner, but notwithstanding this, the incumbent, who has been in the grade for ten years and at the top of it for five, has obtained less benefit from the Revision Schema than many clerks. 3. The Hon f ble the Political Resident informed me that he did not intend to embark on any alterations in the Scheme until it had been given a fair trial, but I feel sure that it will be admitted that the Khan Bahadur has a genuine grievance. Such a case can be met by advance increments, and I, therefore, recommend for the-3- the consideration of the Hon'ble the Political Residents that, in view of his ten years service in his present post, he should be granted the maximum pay of his grade, so that he may obtain some behefit from the new conditions. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Political Agent, Bahrain. K.S.N. \To The Secretary to the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Through The Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to draw your kind attention to the following I have now seen the Statement of pay made out under the new Scheme which has been sanctioned during my absence on leave, and I find that my pay is shewn as Initial pay Rs.390 Personal pay Ks. 10 Total Rs.4QQ My last grade from 19E0 was R$.300-20-400 and I had been drawing the maximum Rs#400/- from November 1925 to April 1928. On return to Bahrain from foreign service under Muscat State in May 1928, I was granted Rs.50/- Special Pay and have been drawing Rs.450/- pay upto May 1930 (over two years). The Indian Attache, Kerman, and the Interpreter Bushire, drew Rs.400/- and the former only Rs.50/- Compensatory (temporary) allowance and not Special pay as in my case. But I am now bracketted with both of them and am, thus, comparatively a loser. It may be mentioned that the Interpreter, Bushire, was promoted only about 2 years ago and was given Rs.400/- maximum pay of the grade (Rs.300-20-400). At the newly fixed rate I get only Rs.25/- increase which is about as muchI —2— as much as some clerks and Munshis get under the re-organisation Scheme, while all the gazetted subordinate Officers get much more nett increase of emoluments with 2 to 4 advance increments in certain cases. to submit the matter to the Hon f ble the Political Resident, who, I hope, will be good enough to recommend that I may be granted the Rs.450/- pay which I have already drawn for over two years previously, or, the maximum pay Rs.450/- under the newly sanctioned Scheme so that I may be adequately benefitted thereby. I, therefore, request you to be so kind as I have the honour to be, Sir, lour most obedient servant 20th November 1930 Indian Assistant, Bahrain.w \ !§AL55^Kf s. £.44. ^ r«A /7fe6, OFFI BS Ot THE at#,. , ,, lb'ft'3* Ii5 ;) tieJ^ L* ' _1^. /y*^cL4L*t, No.yk//'f)^ fr^A^OA*- h^Cd^J- CJr^'&amp;cjL^i Je informed that under order No , dated— (Gazette page ), he is entitled to draw pay and allowances at the monthly rates shown below from the dates specified :— Details of calculation.

Proposal for certain Government officials in the Persian Gulf Residency Establish ment to draw advanced^increments under the Revision Scheme. In l .is letter No. 1435, dated the 31st July 1928, li Sir ^ionel Haworth asked L.at ii: the case of the incumbents - ■ of the posts of Head Clerk Grade I and of the azutted appointments, those who had already attained the maximum under the old scale should be ^iven the benefit of the period during which they had drawn that maximum towards earning' increments under the new scale. The .Government of India ir conveyinj sanction to the Revision Scheme (vide Foreign and Political Department memorandum Ko.F.25-E/23, dated the 15th April 1930) have made no comments on the above request and I am consequently led to believe that they would prefer that the matter be sa submitted to them specifically showing in detail the effect of the recommendation made. The individuals affected are o. .y four as shown Date on^wldch attain -ed maximum under old scale. 1.11.1925 m&gt;. 400/- 1.11.1925 ;,s.400/- 26.6.1928 Rs.4o0/- 18.1.1929 .3 .250/- hll these have over 20 years service and as ■ experience has shown that not many of the Establishment in the Persian Gulf serve their full time for pension owirr to the unhealthy climate in which they serve, it S ecnis r . below :- L y N a m e .

Buu ;et provision exists for this, as a total adaitional sum of is.21,200 was provided to meet the cost of the revision scheme out of wnich only Rs.17,000 approximately are required during the present year. Actually, in tAe first instance the clerical establishment have only benefitted by the jrant of Gulf Allowances and very slightly by tne revised r ; .es sanctioned. t..,ou£ii of course they will benefit by tAe latter ultimatelv* Some of the more senior members however will hardly have time to reach their maximum pay before they are compelled to retire: they will have served for many years on lower rates, and it is to benefit them that tue present proposal is submitted.

Please report for the information of the Hon'hle the Political Resident the reason for his not taking over till the 30th April. By Order. Captain., Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf. P.A. Ref. above. Khah Bahadur Abdul Haiy arrived here in the evening^of the 25th April, 1931. The following day was spent in setting up his household since in these remote places hotels and other facilities which exist in India are not obtainable. 27th 28th and 29th April were Id holidays and visits had to be paid to the Sheikhs and notables. During these visits he was introduced by Saiyid Abdul Rezzaq^ Surely G-overnment ii could not expect Saiyid Abdur Rezzaq to hand over charge to the Khan Bahadur during holidays. What is now required is sanction of the Hon T ble the Political Resident to the extention of the ioining time from 26th to 29th April, 1931, vide letter from the A.ti.G.R. hereto attached. It will be seen however that the K.B. did not wilfully delay in taking over his duties here since as a matter of fact paying official Id visits is duty itself. ^ T/'0 C's. P.

In view of the above you will appreciate that it was hardly possible for Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiy to have taken over charge here till t o 30th April.
