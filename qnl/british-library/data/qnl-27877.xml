(V 3. Mr. Mellon during his stay in Tehran seems to have been able to arouse a certain amount of interest in the Ministry of Peats, Telegraphs and Telephones in the development of telegraphic communications in Persia by the installations of f/arconi equipmstit. Monsieur Mosiiar, the Minister of Posts, megraphs and Telephones, has invited him to submit proposals for the improvement of the services TeUrrin-Isfahan-dhiraz-Bushire and Tehran-Yezd-Xermun- S i r j a n-Da ul a tab ad-Bandar-Abb a s in time to enable the Ministry to apply for credits in next year’s budget. 3. I consider that both political and commercial con siderations make it necessary to develop as quickly as possible telecommunication between Persia and India and Iraq, especially with the former; with which existing telegraph facilities are entirely inadequate for the traffic that will ensue if the t^es between Persia and India are to be strengthened. There are strong arguments in favour of supplying Marconi equipment, principally because the telegraph services from India and in the Persian Gulf are operated by Messrs. Cables and irelese, who are closely associated with Marconi’s Wireless Telegraph Company. 4. An American telecommunications engineer, Mr* J.A. Mendenhall, Is understood to have been in Tehran for the last few months to advise the Persian Government on the development of Internal radio telegraph services. It would obviously be desirable however for the Persians to look to the United Kingdom for advice on this subject and thus ultimately British equipment should be used; and I hope that it will be possible for Messrs. Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company to follow up energetically 1 the work begun by Mr. Mellon. — 5* I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Government *1 of India, to the Department of Overseas Tra&lt; e and to His Majesty's Ambassadors in Bagdad and Cairo.

IX,. iir, f^Gllon of Mf rconls was introduced to me by Corarnercial Secretary; in connexion with a scheme he is discussing with Persian Government; (Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones' to introduce Radio Tele:.hones in Persia instead of a difficult-to- maintain Surface Trunk Telephone system. 2. The Minister of Poots, Telegraphs and Telephones had in mind the connexion of Tehran by Trunk Surface lines:- 1. Tehran-Icfehnr, Shiraz, Bushire.~ 2. Tehran-I sf shan -Yezd-Keman -Bandar-Abbas, and expressed hope that British Military would leave the Trunk Gurface-line^ 6, (Tehran-hanadan—Kerman shah—Bagdad in situation for the Persians to tftke on and une. 3. r. Mellon’s idea is that the Government of India may be interested in any such development of a Radio Telephone System, for they already have 'it installed at New-Delhl for cornmunicstion with London, and Lorfdcttl is practically on the same line as Tehran from Delhi* 4. I gather that once a main installation is erected at ^ euran , it is an easy matter of directional wireless to cover London-bagdad-Delhi or Bombay or wherever the system Is set up* 5. For work inside Persia smaller sets would suffice at Isfahan-vShirnz- v ezd-Kernan-rmshire etc., for communication with each other and with Tehran. As 'r. Mellon is seeing the T -inlrter of Ports, Telegraphs and Telephones to-day he will let me know later v/hat the siturtion is. 7. lie feels sure it would be cheaper to inetal and maintain Radio Telephones than to try to have a surface line of copper-wire plus intermediate boosting — stations and always the danger of the line being cut by thieves or anti-Persian Government elements. 8* Ab C able and jreless Limited have control of all comnuini cat ions from India abroad, they would be concerned. In any case they are in same group as Marconi’ p . Mr. Col Ion came to tell me of hip interview with Minister of Posts-Telegraphs and Telephones and said he had been well received and had been rsked to submit vithin a month comparative statement and tender for construction for erection of internal Radio telephone system - working on Tehran as Centre = ultiple working to the stations in (i) md ( 2 ) of paragraph 2 , and single channel from those stations to Tehran. 10. He asked if Bagdad was ready to accept Radio 'phone messages and vvas told that Bagdad had not yet been approached (as far ns ” r r. Mellon knew) but that would be proceeded with - as thev had no set there. * /ll.11. The Minister seened keen on Bombay too. He said he wants to got his in tornnl systen going properly before tackling in&gt;nrl coifiMonications from the sane installation. 1^. He did not mention a desire to open up with Russia!! 13.

I MPORTANT . Addressed to Secretary of State for India, repeated to Minister at Tehran No,39, Military requirements now make it necessary to establish land telegraph and telephone circuits between India and Middle East. It is intended that ♦route (so far as India and Persia are concerned) should be Quetta Mirpawa 2i ah id an Kerman Isfahan Sultan Abadan and thence to link with Iraq system. Line will consist of four copper wires carried on existing telegraph poles (? where) available. Construction will be military commitment and military parties from India will be responsible for construction as far as new Armindla operational boundary near Kerman. It is requested that Minister at Tehran may be instructed to inform Persian Government of decision stated in ( ? paragraph 1) above and to request till necessary oo~operation including their agreement to use of Persian telegraph poles as that Construction may proceed at early date without interference. It is also proposed at a later date to construct military telegraph line from Zahi&amp;an to Meshed to meet possible reconstruction by military Iraq from Tehran to Meshed. This line would be of/thfeS**md again would be laid on existing Persian telegraph poles where suitable. The Persian Government might be informed of this more distant project also. RECd. POL.

So Lieutenant-Colonel Dodd*8 report deals in d.etail with the telegraph and telephone lines at present operated hy the Persian Government and with the wireless stations at present in use. There is, as he states, no wireless telephony and the Imperial and International Communications Company will have full information as to the cables along the Persian Gulf. 1 ifco The telegraph and telephone services are at present almost entirely in the hands of the Government with the exception of the extensive and highly efficient private system of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Kbuzistan.

The complete system of Persia is fehown on the attached map and the detailed report forwarded herewith. So There are at present 9,706 miles of line in Persia carried on 155,939 wooden poles and 67,7Q8 iron poles. The wire is 3 to 6 m/m in diameter. It is proposed to construct a further 1,000 miles of line in the near future and the Anglo-Persian Oil company have *en approached for assistance in transporting and delivering the necessary material. 3o Eighty five of the more important offices take messages in Latin script; the remainder in Persian only. 4„ International communications are maintained by means of the Imperial and International Communications Company Limited through an office located at Raishir, near Bushire. This Company maintains the following cables in the Persian Gulf Bushire ~ Jask 8 cables Bushire - Fao ............... 8 cables Bushire - Henjam 1 cable Henjam - Bander Abbas ....... 1 cable (and land line) Henjam - Jask 1 cable Charbar - Jaak 1 cable Muscat - Jask 1 cable 5 0 Telegraphic communication with Russian territory and with the rest of Europe is maintained via Tiflis and via Odessa respectively, the Tabriz and Julfa lines being linked up for a limited period daily at a fixed hour with both above lines. 6o Two submarine cables, 312 metres in length, connect Kazian with pahlevi across the mouth of the Murdab and in the same way in South Persia 2 cables, ^40 metres in length, connect Mohammerah with Abadan across the Karun River. ?o Very recent construction in the area West of senneh in Kurdistan has not been included as full details are not available but it is believed that an office has been opened at Merivan connected with the main system via Senneh.All telegraph lines existent are shown on attached map hut small and unimportant offices on the main lines which handle practically no traffic are, however, omitted. For instance Dehbid and Savand on the Isfahan - Shiraz line have an operator each who are responsible for the good condition of the line but, except for practice work, do not handle any local traffic whatsoever.THE TEIESH6.EH SYSTEM OF PKBSIA DETAIEED REPORT.
