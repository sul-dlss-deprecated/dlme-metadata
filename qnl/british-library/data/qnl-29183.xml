Vfe have novf revived a further letter from Hay^of ^vhiciil^ Regulatien on s on similar lines in respect of Koweit. In the absence of ar\y British section of the Koweit /Police v/e think that such a Regulation making possible enrolment of British (or American; special police officers from among the oil company's employees at Howeit is undoubtedly necessary. You may remember that a section of British police was introduced into the Bahrein State Police 2 or 3 years ago because of the 4 problems involved in dealing with tough elements / among' f ' t:,;: ^ - » •' ’ - • ! \ araong the American labour imported by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. I understand that similar types of labour likely to be imported into Koweit by the Kovyeit Oil Company in connection with their proposed construction schemes ; and it would have been a very good thing if we could have persuaded the Sheikh of Koweit to do liluiui/trjai Unfortunately he is slio\lng reluctance to agree to our proposal that he might appoint a British Adviser and other British officials including a Commandant of Police. Jithout such a British Adviser or Commandant it is doubtful whether it would be wise to enrol British police officers into the Koweit Police even if the Sheikh were agreeable t j this. /crfa~ m 1 ' 3. As regards -four of the/King's Regulation^ this seems all right to us but it has not been initialled by Hay in accordance with strictly correct procedure. If you think that this formality is necessary before * the Regulation can be allowed by your Secretary of /St ateBPWMBBi w fVc«^ \^ Ca^. I enclose a copy of letter No. C/781, dated the 29th November, 1947 from Tandy, with its enclosure, on the subject of appointment of Special Police Officers in Kuwait, and request that, if you see no objection, a regulation in accordance with the draft may kindly be formally allowed by the Secretary of State and forwarded to me for enforcement as in the case of Qatar - c.f. my demi-official letter No. 3553-18/16 dated the 1st December, 1947.

From The Political Agent, Kuwait. To The Secretary to the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain. Subject:- Kings Regulations. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your endorsement No. 3377 dated the 7th November, 1947 and to recommend that a Kings Regulation should be made for Kuwait similar to that made for Qatar. A draft is enclosed. / 2. I consider that this is necessary owing to the influx of Americans, Europeans and Indians, employed by the Kuwait Oil Company. Trouble would almost certainly arise should it be necessary for the present Kuwait police to investigate complaints or make arrests among them.
