The front has the throne name of Amenophis III (1388-1351/1350 BCE). The reverse lists the name and royal title of the Queen Tiye. The workmanship on the piece is good, and it is simply made. \r\n\r\nThe plaque functioned as a individualized amulet, and was originally mounted, probably as part of a finger ring. The amulet should secure the special role of Queen Tiye, and assure the royal patronage of king and queen for its owner. In addition, it is likely that this royal couple were considered to be successful mediators to the gods, especially to Amun-Re. \r\n\r\nThere are many examples of plaques and scarabs with the names Amenophis III and his wife Tiye, found in and outside of Egypt. The possibility of reading the throne name as an Amun's trigram increases the magical value of the amulet.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/1920", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "18th Dynasty", "Reign": "Amenophis III (1388-1351/1350 BC)", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2009-09-11T09:35:05.56", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.67_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.67_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.67_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.67_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CUR_42.67_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CUR_42.67_Fnt_DD_design_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.67_Fnt_DD_hieroglyphictext_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.67_Fnt_DD_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.67_Fnt_DD_TranscriptionRS2009.jpg, CUR_42.67_Rev_DD_design_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.67_Rev_DD_hieroglyphictext_RS2009.jpg, CUR_42.67_Rev_DD_RS2", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
