A temporary clerk, having no substantive appointment, may, under the fundamental Kules, draw as pay a sum not exceeding the presumptive pay of the appointment in which he officiates. The procedure, however, adopted by this iesidjncy lias been to recruit temporary clerks in grade IV (100-4-120), irrespective of the grades o: the posts in which they are appointed to officiate. in accordance with this procedure the Hon'ble the Political Resident wishes it to be clearly understood that no temporary clerk shall be graded higher than grade IV. A temporary clerk may, however, be granted increments in grade IV, not as a matter of course, but conditional on his having rendered satisfactory service and to there being a prospect of his continuing in service for a reasonable time thereafter. The grant of such increments to temporary clerks should in every case have the prior approval of the Hon'ble the Political Resident. c/i By order, j Captain, At.../ Secretary to the Political Resident V im. in the Persian Gr u lf #No,2052 of 1^26• British Reaidency ^ Consulate General, Buahire, the 15th Decenber 1920.

I further realize that in the exigencies of service, I am bound to go wherever ordered, but my present circum stances require that i should be here for some time more. I may also mention that the post of 2nd Clerk and 1st wunshi at Bahrein are of equal gradation, for both posts of which the permanent incumbents are wanting. I am Acting as 1st kunshi and by reason of Kuwait man coming here as 1st kunshi, i may be shown as Acting find Clerk and thus retained. This will not effect other permanent staff. As the matter is urgent, reply may please be asked for by wire, I beg to remain. Sir, Xour most obedient servant Sd/ Abdul Latif Acg 1st Munshi, Bahrein.

As I have already toid Captain Prior demi-official- ly, I consider him definitely unfit for the post of 'munshi' 1 in this Agency, or anywhere else where he would be required to translate into Arabic or draft letters in that language. Captain Prior apparently seemeo to have heard that h# had a quite reaiMrkable knowledge' of Arabic. This is not the case at 4&gt; * all: many of his idious are foreign, and his grammar is by no iieaas faultless, he has a ^ood useful working Knowledge for a foreigner, and that ic ail. But that is not enouRh for a 'munshi': there should be no fear of the language of a letter issuing from a Political Agancy exciting ridicule, but that : W is Just what a letter written by him, or by ma, or by almost every foreigner, might do. I think you will agree that one ^ould tell from the language of it that tne attached letter I was not written by an )?ngli8hman - yet his H^igliah is much better than his Arabic. I wish to make it perfectly clear that, although I say he is unfit for the post of 'munshi', I think he might ba most useful if otherwise employed. He has an extremely good knowledge of English and an excellent hanowriting, and is in j my opinion a very promising clerk, a Knowledge of Arabic such as he possesses is useful to anyone on this side of the Gulf, and would be quite sufficient to be very usefulD.O. f*/ y ^ POLITICAL AGENCY. { ^ 'Q KUWAIT, Vv, A&gt;at6 ^ ; I XXyN 3&gt;'f'2% PERSIAN GULF. ^pT^T, aKI f J|£^ 25th December 192?. fag (Sccrzrzefc^ Many thanks for your D .O. of 11th December about Abdul Aziz bin Hamad bin Saleh, and for all the trouble you have taken in the matter.

Pereira received with your letter No. 113 of 22nd February 1928, I have the honour to state that Mr. Pereira was on furlough upto 18th December 1918, thUs axl privilege leave at his credit prior to that date (Article 246S.R).The amount of privilege leave due on 1st January 1922 comes therefore to 3 months 9 days and not to 1 year as shown in columns 4,6, and 16 Leave due under P.R.77 to (ii) (2) (i.e. l/13th of the period of duty inclusive.of periods of 1 urlongfr. medical certificate etc. i.e. l/12th of 14 years 2 months 11 days the periods from 1st April 100 190 , &gt; to 25th July 1912, 25th October 1912 to 28th August 1918 and 19th December 1918 to Slot December 1921) comes to 1 year 2 months 6 days and not -to 1 year|6 days as shown in columns 5 and 71 leaving a net balance oi 10 months and 26 days in column 17 and not 11 months 26 days as shown I at present. In calculating leave earned fractions of and one hal^ 14 |9o -2- y % a day shouid be taken as one day. Those below -halfi being neglected. The leave earned on 9th May 1922 and 18th February 1926 comes to 11 days and 3 months 3 days respectively and not to 12 days and 3 months 4 days respectively as shown in coQaunn 5, According to the entry in the service book he was on combined I Ea&amp;KXK&amp;XftKX leave for 10 months (i.e. 4. months on full average pay and 6 months on average pay) with eiiect from 9th i May 1922 which was extended upto 7th April 1923 on £ average pay • (the extension was sanctioned 1'or over month. A note may oe made in the service book that the portion of leave not availed ol has r been cancelled) From the leave account it appears that ne was granted 6 months leave on average pay from 9th May 19'^2 to oth November 1922. The discrepancy may kindly be reconciled. On 9th May 1922 he hafiLat credit leave .on average pay for 3 nionths 21 days (col, 6) Gol. 10 of the account should therefore be debited with 3 months 21 days and the balance of leave on average pay availed of should be shown in column 11. He was granted 9 months leave with effect from 18th February 1926 while he returned to duty on 20th November 1926 (afternoon) Though the leave account has been debited with the period of overstayal viz 3 days in addition to the period of leave originally granted to him no mention has been made in the service book whether his leave was or was not extended upto 20th November 1926o In the latter catie he was not entitled to any leave salary for the period of overstayal under F.R.73. 4 The Government served under is the Central Government.

There ic no doubt that ^y confirmation came into effect when the post of 3rd clerk, Vuccat fell vacant consequent on the promotion of its permanent incu^bant Vr# D^ruz end that Shaikh ^bdul Latif jot an earlier chance of being; confirmed against the then vacant post of 2nd Vunshi, Bahrain. But if the confirmation of Shaikh 'Abdul Latif as 2nd Vunchi, Bahrain, came into effect, the intention was only to fill in a 4tk grade vacancy by him and no one e^lse as it was his turn to be confirmed to a 4th grade vacancy, ^his tends to show in a way that seniority was the sole criterion taken into consideration at the tir^e or his confirmation and not qualification» in Arabic and Persian' requisite for the post. Both the posts are in the same grade and naturally therefore there exists no rivalry between Shaikh *Abdul Latif and J. Again it is out of ry province to say as to which of the two of us is better fitted for the job of 2nd Vuashi by reason of language qualifications requisite for the post. All this rests with you but what remains on my part to add is the fact that both the designations as cited in Bushire letter quoted above are based on the records according: to which the confirmation of both of us came into effect as the chances oi vacancies presented themselves and not; on the subsequent records wi.ich are quite clear on the subject.-lie authority according to whioh rry posting as 'Ind llunsixi and that or Siiaikii ^biiul Latif ae officiatirjg 2nd. clerk, -oaLrain ca^e into effect is Busiiire tele^ra^ No, 1276, dated the 5tii Decetrber 1927 which explicitly states thaj?

This being the case I think I have a prior olaisi to the land applied for because:- (1) I belong to a city (Dera Ghazi Khan) which was oowpletely washed away by river Indus during the erosions of 1909-11 • a fact which is well known to the Punjab Govt;. (2) Though the lands possessed of by vy tmtmxx father and fawily wewbera and situated in the forver city of Dera Ghazi Khan have re-appeared owing to the river's changing its course, yet we are not so fortunate enough to recover thev because the Authorities, fiving to the difficulty \ of precisely re-disttibuting the land awong the people, have decided to assign the produce of such lands to the local charitable funds.2.

Te generally have and there are at present, four clerks on our clerical establishment who are a'bove the sanctioned strength and whom we are a 'ble to retain owing to leave vacancies. These four constitute in effect a leave reserve. They are, however, treated as temporary and are gradually absorbed into the sanctioned strength as vacancies in the permanent appointments occur. Owing to their 'being in service already, and to obviate the drawbacks and dangers you mention of engaging men temporarily for short periods it is desirable to utilise the services of these men in an actual leave vacancy, or a vacancy caused by a chain of shifts consequent on a clerk's going on leave or on transfer. T am forwarding herewith an application from Mr.Gtfmlam Haider for transfer to Bahrein as 2nd Munshi« It is recognised tTuct it is necessary to get the best man and one who has a knowledge of Arabic if available,but in view of the fact that the 2nd I'unshi's poet has been filled in the past by men not knowing Arabic Quite well, to wit Tr.

G.H. Dar to sit for the London Matriculation Examination. 2. The Inspector General of Education has forwarded to me the attached copy of a letter which he addressed to Mr. Dar on the 24th of October, 1929. Apparently Mr. Dar has overlooked the fact that candidates taking a special language must give some months notice according to the regulations (of which I understand he has a copy). I should be glad to know exactly for which session Mr. Dar wishes to sit. His application will then be duly forwarded. 3. I may add that the arrangements for these examinations are entirely in the hands of the Inspector General of Education, Baghdad, although much of the correspondence passes through this Secretariat and the actual invigilation is carried out here.
