In the letter, Hardy remonstrated in strong terms against reported plans of an attack on Bahrein [Bahrain]. Stannus attaches a translation of a letter addressed by him to His Royal Highness Hoossein Ali Mirza [Ḥusayn ‘Alī Mīrzā], Prince at Shiraz, dated 15 March 1824, in which Stannus acknowledges the impropriety of Hardy's letter and states that it was a result of Hardy not having been properly acquainted with the views of the Government of Bombay. Stannus explains to Newnham that he delayed sending this letter of explanation to His Royal Highness on the grounds that the matter was being referred to the Government of Bombay. The aforementioned attachment follows on from the letter.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054395.0x000022#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
