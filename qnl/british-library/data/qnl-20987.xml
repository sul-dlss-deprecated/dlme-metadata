I have never had an opportunity of meeting H.M.Ahdul Aziz hin Saud so it is difficult to give an accurate forecast on the question of a possible counter claim by him for a Hejdi Consul at Bahrein, Judging from the trend of his policy however I do consider that a counter claim of the sort mentioned by the Government of India, is a danger which has to be considered. 2, You may remember that last year Bin Saud made a veiled attempt to establish a Consul at Kuwait and at 2ubair^empowered to visa passports. I left Kuwait while the correspondence on the subject, was still continuing so I am unaware of the conclusion reached. The attitude of Bin Saud in re Kuwait represen tation would, I think, be a guide to his procedure re Bahrein but in my opinion the best way to discover it would be in an Informal converaatlon between H.M.Consul at Jeddah and the King himself. My object is to obtain the right of direct cor respondence with the i^jairs of ^atif and Hassa on matters ofof Gulf interest affecting Bahrein, ^atar and ^atif.These would usually be connected with, pearling and the trade in rice, dates and grain, X should also like the right to Tisit Q,atif and Ugair, and Hassa the latter only with the special permission of the rmir, in order to discuss mat~ ters affecting British suhjeots t such as the recent ex pulsion of the Hindus from ^atif, in order to pare the way to a settlement of questions at a personal interview, before they have time to 'become of major importance. It would be impossible for H.B.M^Consul at Jeddah, who has no knowledge of Gulf conditions, to deal with such matters direct with His Majesty, 4, A little friendly correspondence is actually passing between myself and the neighbouring Hejdian mirs but if His liajesty bin Saud wishes to invoke internation al law, I suppose it would have to stop. It is of inter est that His Majesty himself recently wrote me a letter direct recommending one of the Bowasir headmen to my con sideration and his protest of last year against Captain Alban was addressed to the Political Agent,Bahrein, 5, At one moment the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd ap pears as a power claiming to be treated for instance like Turkey, the next it is a Bedouin Sheikhship, acting much as any other of the Gulf principalities would act. His Majesty's protest of 30th Kabi ath Thani against Cap tain Alban's procedure to which I referred in my Ho.595/ V,0, of 14th December 1927 shows that the Bedouin Sheikh is liable without notice to become the great king. It is for this reason that I recommend that the position of the Political Agent vis a vis the coastal -amirates of Bejd * should be regularised if possible, I think that the best way of attaining the object would be by appointing the incumbent of the Political Agency to be Consul for ^atif and Hassa in addition, I do not recommend that these additional1 ; ■ . V :w2. ■•.'i' Ci C. U :.:i i ' ■ ■ additional duties should give the Political Agent My right to ciuunpion the cause oi Baiireinis living in ^audiavL territory 9 buw I do luooitauvud Uiat he be em^o^ered to settle ooiBzaercial disputes between merchants residing in Bahrein on the one part and those of Hassa and ^atif on the other in friendly cooperation with the i^nirs of the districts for which he is appointed. 6, The number of actual British subjects in Hassa, Ujair and ^atif at the present moment is negligible, I am told that there are 2 Bohras at ^atif and 1 Punjabi at Hassa, but none other. There are a few Iraqis and Kuwai tis in Government employ at Jubail, Qatif and Hassa and many Irakis living in the Hassa oasis. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, d.

Now that the British Government have asked Us to allow them to return to Qatif to finish their work in a fixed time, v.® have granted the request of the British Government and allowed them to return to Qatif and to stay there three montaid only during which they will finish their work# So you have to allow them to return to Qatif and stay there the three months. ;e have also allowed them to come to Qatif if they like during the season of Essulok and to stay there two months to work in entirely commercial matters. ^0 have &gt;sked the British GovernmentGovQrnaent to advise them in oase they wish to go to your place to apply for permission from you to enter before they proceed from Bahrein.

WITH refereriG® to Foreign Office despatch No. 71 of the 11th April last, I am directed by Mr. oecretary Henderson to transmit to you the accompanying copies of a revised memorandum on the question of the channels to be used for communications between His Majesty King Ibn Saud, or the Hejaz-Nejd Government, and the High Commissioners for Iraq, Palestine and Transjordan, and certain British officers in the Persian Gulf. The present memorandum should be substituted for that enclosed in the Foreign Office despatch referred to above. 2. You will observe that insertions have been made in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the original memorandum so as to cover the question of communications regarding Hejaz-Nejd affairs to and from posts in the Persian Gulf. I am, &amp;c. G. W. RENDEL. Enclosure in No. 1. Communications with Ihn Saud. UNTIL August 1928 communications intended for Ibn Saud were sent through His Majesty's agent and consul at Jeddah when Ibn Saud was in the Hejaz, or through the Resident in the Persian Gulf (at Bushire) when Ibn Saud was in Nejd. 2. In August 1928, Ibn Saud requested that this arrangement should no longer be followed, but that in future all communications should be addressed to him through His Majesty's agent and consul, even during his periods of residence in Nejd. It may, therefore, now be laid down as a general rule that all communications for Ibn Saud shall pass through His Majesty's agency at Jeddah. 3. The High Commissioners at Bagdad and Jerusalem are authorised to correspond direct with Ibn Saud on matters of detail arising out of the Bahra and Hadda agreements, and such communications will ordinarily be sent through His Majesty's agent at Jeddah, who will act merely as a channel of communication. In cases of extreme urgency, however, it will still be open to the High Commissioners to communicate with Ibn Saud through the quickest available channel, while sending a repetition or copy to His Majesty's agent and consul at Jeddah. Communications intended for Ibn Saud will ordinarily be addressed to His Majesty's agent at Jeddah direct by the High Commissioners concerned, but copies in the case of despatches, and repetitions in the case of telegrams, should in every case be sent to the Colonial Office. 4. As a general rule, such communications, whether sent by telegram or despatch, will be transmitted textually by His Majesty's agent at Jeddah, and they should be drafted on that understanding. His Majesty's agent will, however, have discretion, more particularly in the case of telegrams, to introduce any minor modifications of style or wording which, in the light of his local knowledge, he may consider desirable. It will, further, be open to His Majesty's agent at Jeddah, in any case where he considers that the proposed communication raises issues of political importance, to refer to the Foreign Office for instruction. Information received from the Iraqi and Transjordan Governments respecting raids on their tribes by Nejdian tribesmen and other minor frontier incidents, or replies from those Govern ments to complaints by the Hejazi Government respecting raids on Hejazi or Nejdian tribesmen and other minor frontier incidents, should, subject to the proviso indicated above, be communicated by His Majesty's agent to the Hejazi Government, without awaiting the receipt of instructions from London. 5. Communications for Ibn Saud, or regarding Nejdian or Hejazi affairs, from Iraq, Transjordan, Palestine or the Persian Gulf posts, on all other questions, [903 q—1]should be addressed to the Colonial Office, but repeated, or copied, to Jeddah in every case. In such cases His Majesty's agent at Jeddah will not take official action on the communication until specifically authorised to do so by the Foreign Office. He may, however, if the matter to be dealt with is in any w^a}^ urgent, take such informal action with the competent Hejazi authorities as he may think desirable. 6. Similarly, His Majesty's agent at Jeddah may address the High Commissioners for Iraq, Transjordan and Palestine, the Political Resident at Bushire and the political agents at Koweit and Bahrein, direct on points of fact, on matters of routine, or in reply to enquiries, sending a repetition, or copy, in each case to the Foreign Office, and in the case of Koweit and Bahrein to the Resident in the Persian Gulf also; while, on all other questions, he will address the Foreign Office direct, sending a repetition or copy to Bagdad or Jerusalem, when either is concerned, and reporting in each case in the body of the telegram or despatch that he has done so.

Tk* &amp; c-f&gt; it is very probable that i shall ha\ T e another meeting v/ith Bin Sand in the near future - probably in May. i shall be going primarily to discuss Kuwait questions but he has also said that there are various matters connected with the Persian Gulf which he wishes to raise and they will pre- suinably be the three questions mentioned in Jeddah despatch I'lo. 150, dated the 19th June 1929, of which j a copy was sent to you. The three points are therein j||- only mentioned vaguely and His Majesty's G-overnment are asking him to let them know much more stjc cif ically what he wants to discuss, j.n view however of the slowness of communication with Bahrain and the fact that i shall probably be asked for my views shortly I am writing now to you on the subject. The first question is that of customs and transit dues collected at Bahrain on goods destined for Isiejd. i do not think that Bahrain could be asked to make greater concessions than it has already dor^e, but Bin Saud is, 1 believe, going to raise the question of goods imported for his personal use, to which Captain C. G. Prior, i.A., Political Agent, bahhaiu.I'/h which ezprersion he will probably give a somewhat wide sense. As you know certain Ruling jrnnces in India are allowed customs exemption on goods imported .for the it personal use and possibly some similar con cession might be Tna.de to Bin Baud provided we could tie him down to certain specific articles, e.g. motor ; , sporting rirles, etc., and exclude such things as rice, sugar, and so on. This will probably be dlrficult to do and i imagine in practice articles of that kind are imported by Bin Saud through Mecca and, not through Bahrain. .please let me know your views on 'his question generally and also what you estimate the present concession costs the Bahrain State annually- Should I be right in saying that the present 2 per cent customs duties really only cover the clerical and other expenses involved in the transit? The two other points, viz. passports for JNejdis and position of his agents are inter-related. Presumably this is Ousaibi 1 s handiwork, and an attempt on his part to get some sort of official position for himself. The latter point we can, i think, veto without difficulty, on the ground' that it would lead to similar requests from iraq and Persia. as regards the former, is the passport system f^r ijjejdis working it; satisfactorily, and has Bin Baud got any legitimate grievance of any kind ?'V Confidential. ITo. 31 C. The Agency, Bahrain. 28th March If30. Please refer to your letter No. 83 S, dated tte 25U of February 195 0. I have sent the actual figures in a report which I made last year, but it may be safely assumed that the R.E. concession costs the Bahrain Government a laich a year. I en tirely agree with your view thatthey cannot reasonably ex- increase pectec to aocfeRiicc it, and the original concession, as you are aware was fo ced upon Shaiich Isa after a considerable amount of pressure. The 2 % due more than covers the clerical and other expenses, but not by very much. I think l/ 0 would actually cover the out of pocicet expenses, but as you sryy know the Government of India charge an R.E. duty that amounts to more than 3/*, for they only grant a rebate of 7/8ths duty on a tariff that it is often as much as 25%* I dont -hink even then that ports like Bombay and Karachi are a fair standard. Most ol the work is carried out by small ship ments in dhows, and provides far more work that a similar transaction in India, 4. I think it would be most unfair if we allov/dd Bin Saud to force another concession out of Bahrain, and I feel sure that when Shaikh Hamad realised that any further concession would involve a cut in the Civil List he would not give way, terrified of Bin Saud though he is. I dont feel that it is possible to give any concession to personal as opposed to private imports. India again is not A parallel. In India, the Central Government is taking a full customs due from the whole State and can well afford to throwgx its ruler a sop or two. Here we only get 2/o and it is Bin Saud who charges the 25% to his own people. Kashmir is the only i i 1 I 1 i ■ j'l -f 'M 5 v . ,;ii | i * - IPage 2. Indian State that can be taken as a fair analogy, and I am sure that the Government of India would never give up the t/sth duty they retain from Kashmir imports. 5. I discussed the point with Sir Francis Humphreys in Baghdad and he told me that they allowed the Afghan Hoyal family the concession of free importc, and that they promptly proceeded ti) imports all the State requirements as their personal property ! Bin Saud obtained a permit for 40,000 bags of rice at a special weight ( a lighter bag 4 so that may be generous cheaply ) and this shows what he considers 1 personal imports. f Almost everything that Ousaibis import is in his name, and unless a limited number of carr;, say two a year, were specified, Q,usaibis would bring in all their stuff saying it was their masters, and we would be unable to prove it was not. They have a curious system by which the King^ agents only take it over at C^atif, but all passes in his name notwithstanding. 6. The Bahrain Government will be prepared to ma^ce no charge on arms or ammunition, and in fact have collected none so far. The import of arms is actually forbidden, so thay have no rate fixed for it. This is a concession that might be made, and it could be extended to cover bombs and all similar letlaal weapons* I would have added aeroplane parts, but it would be very hard to say if canvas or wood ■* was going to repair an aeroplane or not, and anything ambi guous is better left out. Jiddah 7. 'o, M kkkk is not always used, and he imports a great many cars through Bahrain. A dozen have just gone through to him. If cars were included in the concession a very small number would have to be specified, as he im ports quantities of Chevrolet trucks, and if we allowed him two or three a year it would be as many as iCing George n^pmally buys. 8. As regards passports, as I pointed out last year, a Nejdi can obtain a passport by going 5 hours in a ' 1 i fL m § if:3. launch to a distance of '40 miles, whereas in India many people have to go several days journey. 'Mo, he has not a leg to stand on here, and I have never heard the shadow of a grouse about it, and I endorse hundreds of Nejdi papers every year for India and Iraq. Of course the qusaiMs will never 'be satisfied till they get themselves made consuls, hut if we said that we should want to put a consul in Hofuf as a quid proquo we should hear no more about it. 9. When I said in para 6 that they would make no charge on arms, Bin Baud would have to pay the handling or pier fees charges that we all have to pay. Fven I who pay no customs have to pay this, and it amounts roughly to an average of an a nitional l£$ ad valoreiju In Karachi it is slightly more. I hope I have made myself clear.,f o&gt; ^ 0 * Agency, Bahrain. Confidential. _ 5th March 1930. From Captain C.G.Prior, I.A. Political A&amp;ent, Bahrain. To -he Hon , ble '^t.Col.H.V.Biscoe I*A* Political Resident, Persian Gulf. Sir, I have the honour to say that H.M.Bin Saud, iCing of iejd and the Eedjaz, arrived at Bahrain on the 25th Febru ary and left Bahrain for Ojair on the same day. ^ Two telegrams had arrived for Shaikh Isa and ShaiKh Hamad late the preceding night, requesting Shaikh Isa to come to janama so that the iCing might see him, stating that he had no time to spare. The Resident's telegram advising him not to visit Bahrain was received next day, and Shaikh Hamad was informed that he had given up his idea of visiting Bahrain, but the Shaikh, who had been cruising about the harbour since a very early hour, no sooner saw the Patrick Stewart than he dashed off to the ship without a word to the Political Agent or Adviser. It must be remeb^eed that Ibn Saud has the same effect on Shaikh Hamad that Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse might have had on some petty German princeling like Schaumberg Lippe, or the Basileus of the Persian empire on xama the * turannos 1 of some Greek islet, and he is mefmerslied by him. 3. He and his two brothers accompanied the King to the shore, and both on the steamer and on the launch His Majesty confined himself to generalities, and he and all his entourage were markedly reticent regarding the Lupin conferen ce. He said, however, that he had never aspired to be king of the * rabs, but that he was quite content with his king dom of TieJd, and that if a better man than he were forthcomingif! page 2. he would gladly hand over the reins to him. He had been obli ged to crush the rebls as he felt that itnwas in the interests of the country. 4» Scenes of great disorder marked the landing. Mr de Gren- ier, who considers he has an ex-officio right to be at the top of the pier steps and welcome distinguished visitors, was moving to his post, when the Amir of Manama, a colourless non entity who supports himself by sponging on Shaikh Hamad and who ekes out his stipend by a private tax on prostitutes, rudely told him to get off the pier. Mr de Grenier, to whom the Cus toms and its pier is more than a cherished mistress, was beside himself with fury, but controlling himself with difficulty, ks told him that the pier was in his charge and that he would if he saw fit have the Amir truned off. The Amir replied that they were meeting an Arab and not an Englishman, and he appear ed to consider Mr de Grenie^s presence superfluous. 5. On landing, the King received an ovation. The whole (The Indian guard of honour vainly trying to pr e sent^rms .were pier, crowded with some 5000 persons,ran riot.l ^ Th e guard of naturs casting aside all pretence at order, swarmed round Bin Baud firing off their rifles # ami Ihe crowd composed.of principally of Arabs and Kejdis, nearly trod the al Khalifa Shaikhs under foot in their frantic attempts to shake the royal hand. Getting into a car with great difficulty, the King pro ceeded in triumph to the Palace, where he greeted Shaikh Isa, and the veteran ruler is reported to have said that having seen the King he could now die in peace. 6. The King had accepted Shaikh Hamad's invitation to stay the night at Sakhir, and he proceeded there almost immed - diately, pausing to hold a levee at the ^usaibis house at Rifaa which was attended by all the alkhalifa shaikhs and the nota bles of the island. Upon arrival at Sakhir, however, he sudden- changed his mind, and proceeding to Zilag embarked for Ojair the same afternoon. 7. The v/hole effect of his visit has been deplorable.Page 3 A more successful impetus to Pan -Arab feeling could not have been given, and the tenuity of our hold on Bahrain could not have been more clearly demonstarted. In view of the excite ment caused oy tixis visit, another, at a time charged with com munal tens^ion might have incalculable results, and it is to be hoped th it :in Saud wi 1 not again be allowed to approach cTSer to Bahrain than qatif. The futility of the al Khalifa shaikhs in their own dominions has been amply demonstrated, and the ^usaibis, powerful already, have had their prestige immesjaurably enhanced. Bin Saud realises now, if he did not before, that it is only the force of our arms that prevents Bahrain welcoming him as King, and that if his wishes regarding it are not acce- fs ded to, that it^ our influnce and not the Bahrain Government that is to blame.

Shaikh Haned sent for re on Thursday te discuss the letter from Ibn Saeud, Shaikh Abdulla was present during the conver - sation, gatheied tliat they were both extreaily surprised at the tone of the postscript, but had no doubts of its authenticity. Shaikh Abdulla pointed out, as I did, that soue years back Ibn Saoud. of has own accord, asked that all negociations with the Shaikh of Bahrain should be aiade through H.B.M's Political Agent in Bahrain. The letter seemed to be an attempt to deal with him direct contrary to former practice. Shaikh Hamed was rather troubled at the implied threat which seemed to mean that unless Shaikh Hamed agreed to the wishes of Ibn 3a©ud the friendship between them was liable to come to an end. They both thought that the main meaning of the letter was that Ibn Saoud intended to have the R.E. Customs charge abolishe at all costs, whether it met with the approval of this Government and the -British Government, or not. They were very surprised at the suggestion that Ibn Saoud should sent representatives to discuss the matter with Shaikh n amed, direct, Shaikh Earned' remarked that this would mean the ^©zaibis, and if they acted in this way in such a matter they would undoubtedly assume the position of consuls of Ibn Saoud in Bahrain, a proposition which u haikh -teamed regards with mistrust. They both agreed that the Kozaibis were themselves responsible for this action and were probably pressing for it in Negd or the Hejaz. I suggested that Shaikh Hamed should not reply until the matter was referred to the Political Agent, but he was somewhat loath not to acknowledge the letter, he said he woulc|, think about it and then perhaps write the usual complimentary letter, adding a postscript to the effect that the postscript had been recieved but as thepolitical Agent was away, and furtheunore the matter was an official onft and at present under discussion, he could not deal with it except through the proper channels. Shaikh Hamecl said it he wrote letter he would send it in to me for ny opinion before sending it he has now gone back to Sakhrir and I have heard nothing more on the subject. I heard afterwards that he had thought ol senuing Ibn Saoud's letter to the Kozaibis in order to ask them what was meant by it but I do not know whether this was done or not. Shaikh Hamed was in a great hurry when the letter was discussed and he went back to Sakhrir imiiiediately alter the Hieeting. I told Shaikh Abdulla how two of the Kozaibis had called on me the previous day and had had had a conversation with me. m which they told me that they really, in their hearts, preferred this Government to their own. and sought the interests of this Govermi it more than that of their own. and that they wished me to know that they were not responsible for any actions of their own Government, cither particularly or generally, which would in any way injure the Government of Bahrain. Shaikh Abdulla said that ver., likely Ibn Saoud's letter to Shaikh r-amed had been sent to them in an open envelope for them to read before delivery to Shaikh, named, but without doubt they knew all about it and were at the bottom of it themselves. Shaikh Abdulla strongly resentwu this letter but saiu that as Ibn Seauu wa® know»* to wfc *.0 hi.rd pressed for xnone^ thi^ year he was evidently detimined to try and get the R.Ji. customs cancelled. Shaikh Abdulla told Shaikh Hamed. a fact which he did not appear to know, that in other ports no R.E. charge was made, but V J - v ' he also pointed out that a full charge had been levied in trie p^st and it was only reduced at the request of Major Dickson and this reduction was very unpalatable to the feelings of Shaikh Isa and people in Bahrain. i was also told that one Ahmed bin Abdulla, al Doseri is influential with Abdulla bin ^eloui and Ibn Ibn Saoud ana is pressing them over the R»S» question* i will let you know wh^n i fr»® -Shaikh Futaaed again on the subject• f • v».

The 26tii October 1930. i / / r / / From To Captain G.G, Prior, Poiitioal Agent, Bahrain. The Hoii T ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf^ Bushire# Sir, 1 have trxe honour to bring to jour notice instanc es of tJi« continued agression of tha Hng of the Hedjaz an. lus agents the iusaibis, an aggression, if not checked, wil havt; a serious e- lect on our position in Bahrain. 2. It will be remembered that during the summer Bi Jaluwi, the Amir ofHasa had written to Shaikh Hamad ( and * to me j in a somewhat peremptorj fashion demanciBg the surrena r of certain persons A he consid.rea to be of Nejd uationelitj and he also sent men tj fetc^them , an act whi.U was much resentea bj the Ruling familj. Actually the Shaikh refused to admit that they were other than tire Bahrain sub jects, in fact the/ were Dowasir who have li^ed here for manj years though not without trading connections on the mainland, and the men were not returned. I took advantage of the opportunity iofi point out t® Bin Jiluwi that Bin Saud k d himself requested that the practice of sur renaming persons should cease, i nd that it was at his request that we had ceased asking mainland Amirs to send men to Bahrain. 3. While I was in Karachi a theft occurred on a dhow in Bahrain Harbour and both the accused and the Nakhuda were Hasawis. Apparently considering a conviction unlikely the Nakhuda went to Hasa and informed Bin Jiluwi of the occurrence, and he immediately wrote to Shaikh Hamad telling him to have the men sent to Hasa for trial. The case was referrpHm referred to me ana I gave instructions that the men were on 4 no account to he sent to Hasa but hut that they were dealt I i with according to law at Bahrain. ^ 4* On my return here I find that when a promi nent merchant, Mohammad Yateem, recontlj ran over a Hejdi in his car he ms at once summoned b/ the Qusaibis who severe ly raprte.uded him for having injured a subject of H.M. King Ibn Saud. He was later prosecuted by the Police, but their action caused much comment. 5. Again a few da/s before I arrive- d, as a fuA- result of a s uabble at a well, some servants of the | l I' Qusaibis at Rafaa armed with rifles assaulted a servant of J T Shaikh Baahid, the son of the Euler's brother Shaikh Muhammad, and tying him up with a rope, took him to the ^usaibis' hou ^e and confined him there# The Hifaa Arabs took this as an insult I to the Al Khalifa and a riot nearly ensued, but the Imam of mosque managed to calm them, and when Abdul Aziss Qusaibi cam % ''' to the house at night the man was released. 6. As a result of the- pressure by Shaikh Muhaamad, Shaikh Hamad ordered the heir -apparent to go and tell the jusaibis that they must apologise and he conveyed a message to this effect to Hassan Qusaibi. Ho notice, however, was taken of this, ana finally Shaikh gashia and shaikh Muhammad had the Police set in motion and a case registered. The case was brought up before me,but at the last moment. Shaikh Hashid came and said that the tiuaaibis had been to see , ^ the Ruler, and that he had asked Shaikh Muhammad to get his son to stop the case proceeaing. Ho himself, he said, would not on any account have allowed them to escape soot free, buf , he was unable to stand against the expressed wish of the i aaT. I Itar-for. allowi cs. to b. -d the matter was settled. 7.^ I aid not auaress the Qusaibia or take Nation a^mst thm in any inatanoe altiioui-h their action in both tiit two hist mentioned cases was intolerable. Had I called t them to account thej would have said in the first instance that the man was a friend or a servant of theirs and that the/ intervened in a friendly spirit, and in the second that they had no knowledge of what ted happeneaad ana had hasten ea to release the man when thay aiscov&amp;red what had been done. I ao not wish to ^uarrel with them unless thqy give me an unmistaxable Cawsus Belli, but if I see .further signs of their inter!erence I shall take the matter up* ^ ^ last instance is much mora serious,and all.ects the King himself. When 1 arrived, I found that he had recently sent shaikh lb. mad two letters,# One was com- i pliiatrtary *■ ua signed and the other which was attached to _ it ana was in the same hand-writing was not signed and, as you will see most objectionable in tone# I have carefuliy checked the translation and It gives an accurate interpre tation of the original# The Ruler had not replied to it pen. pending my return, and when I got an opportunity to dis cuss it with him in the presence of Shaikh Abdullah and heir-apparent Shaikh Salman, I could clearly see that they were much incensed hy it# 9# ' Ihat does he mean by saying that his people pay heavy taxes ff he said ** they pay nothing but the 5 % custom, which our people pay, and they are far more heavily taxed in their own country# Hor have I ever heard of any of them complain of ill treatment# In feet they flee from oppre ssion in thair own country and come here for justice which they cannot get froia him# Let them return to Basa if they prefer it ' # He then referred to the thinly veil/ed reference to the re-export concession, and said, as he has done before, but this time in far more definite language, th the former reduction from 5 to 2 ^ had been force a on the» and that this concession made Bin 3aud greedy to pay nothing at all# 11 Let him use another port if h&lt;&gt; cannot pay 2 % for ourou ^ expenses here ft he said. 10. 1 raised the question of a reply, and sug gested that he should await your arrival before sending ^ ; ' c ' ' -Loa oil to ao, as he said the letter had bee sometime awaiting a reply, and to delay further would suggest that he could not or would not meet the charges contained in it. It was therefore decided that he should reply in similar style, a complimentary letter dated and signed, and an unsealed attchment which should ask in the same abrupt language as the King had usea what exactly he referred to when he spoke of heavy taxation and ill treatm ment of his subjects. 11. This has been done and I have just received his letter and enclose a copy of it. In its way it is an excellent reply and will have the support of all his brothers. Technically the reply should have been sent through Eushire, but in the circumstances it seemed best t follow the mode employed, especially as the King had himself chosen it. I should ada that the references to the persons ft who would protect his interests ,f mentioned in the King T s letter, are assumed by the Shaikh to refer to H.M. Government. He laughed when he read this, and said % ' Well they are my friends too, and I have nothing to fear from the High Government. ' 12. I have dealt with the matter in some haste, but it seemed important that I should place you in posse ssion of the facts as soon as possible, in view oi your impending departure from Bushire. I venture to hope that the line of action taken by H»s Excellency win meet with your approval and I regret that the laoour involved pre cluded a telegraphic reference to you.

Communications with Ibn Saud and the Eejaz-Nejd Government The creation of a British Legation at Jedda and the establishment of more normal diplomatic relations with # King Ihn Saud have necessitated a revision of the arrangements embodied in the Foreign Office memorandum of September 16, 1929 (enclosed in the despatch lo. 198 of the same date to H.M. Agent and Consul at Jedda), which is superseded in its entirety by the present memorandum. 2. It is desired in future to conduct relations Y^rith King Ibn Saud and his government as far as possioxe m accordance with, the usual diplomatic procedure. Matters which appear to the British authorities in iraq, Paxestine, Trans-Jordan, the Persian Gulf and elsewhere to require representations to King xhn Saud or his government will therefore normally he referred by the High Commissionera, the Political Resident, etc. to the respective Government Departments in London, if they involve questions of policy, or direct to His Majesty 's Legation at Jedda. if of lesser importance.

The British authorities in Iraq, Palestine, Trans-Jordan, the Persian Gulf etc. may use their discretion as to drafting any proposed representations in the form of a memorandum suitable for transmission verbatim to the Hejaz-Fejd authorities. This procedure may conveniently he followed when the subject matter consists mainly of a recital of facts. In all cases, however, His Majesty's Minister will have discretion to use the memorandum as he thinks fit. He will also have discretion, if he elects to forward the memorandum, to introduce minor alterations of language not affecting' the sense of the document. 5. It is realised that, when King Ibn Saud is in parts of Arabia remote from Jedda and within easier reach of Bagdad, Amman or the Persian Gulf, cases may arise oi. such importance and urgency as to make it desirable that the views of His Majesty's Government or tne British authorities, concerned should be conveyed to him by the quickest available means. In such cases the British authorities concerned should report to His hajesty 1 s Government by telegram, indicating the reasons for and the i nature of the proposed representations and repeating their telegram to His Majesty's Minister at Jedda. They should not, however, actually despatch such communications to King Ibn Saud until they receive the approval of his Majesty's Government, save in some exceptional emergency when circumstances render it essential, in their opinion, thatIf* that they should act without awaiting sanction. Should this be done their action and. the reasons for it should simultaneously 'be reported by telegram to His Majesty's Government and the telegram repeated to His Majesty's Minister at Jedda^ 6. In certain oases, e.g. when King Ibn Saud has teen in personal relations with British authorities in Iraq, Trans -Jordan or the Persian Gulf, he may poesibly address letters direct to such authorities. In such cases the officer addressed should, unless the subject O j. the is of minor importance, obtain, before replying, the instructions of the senior British Representative in the territory concerned, or, in the case of the territories bordering on the Persian Gulf, of the Political Resident, and in all cases, even if he replies without doing this, copies of the correspondence should be sent through the usual channels to His Majesty's Government and to His Majesty's Minister at Jedda.
