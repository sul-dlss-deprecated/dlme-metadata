For your kind information I might^state here that these very pearl necklaces are Being imported By Messrs. Ashraf Brothers and the Customs authorities have never questioned. The last consignmenti Oi. i^essrs Ashraf Brothers arrived in Bahrein on the 13th of November1928 and although the same was personally inspected By the Director of Customs, he allowed the same to Be passed. In his letter No:G/56/275 of 13th instant, the Director of Customs informs me that the import of artificial pearls has Been prohibited since some years. But I would like to point out that there has never Been any declaration to the effecu that ar bi^ ii'i^i -nearls should not Be imported.

Further more the pearls importrted By me are drilled ones and they could under no circumstan ces Be used as real ones. This very question had arisen some years Back and the then Political Agent Major C.K.Daly had allowed the drilled pearls to Be passed even though they were Cultured ones.

Sven in the case of legal marriage the Malabar! woman is frequently divorced and left destitute in Bahrein. Hie case of the women who are not legally married is worse as they have either to obtain a husband in Bahrein or descend to a life of shame. It was also alleged that there exist brokers in Calicut and other places, who take a fee in return for their services in procuring women for Arab sailors. The Bahrein Government after consulting the 9adhis ( religious Judges) have issued a proclamation ( copy attached) requiring all Bahrainis bringing hofilah brides to there islands to bring with then, and chow on demand, either a legal certificate of marriage from the Qadhis of ilalabar or a formal document of consent signed by the heads of the women’s village.

She gave satisfactory explanations of the charges against her, and as I believe the State does not wish te proeecute her I merely warned her of the severity with which the Indian Penal Code dealt with offences concerning pregnant women and unborn children, and instructed her to so conduct her practice that such complaints would not arise in future. I also warned her ef the necessity of calling in a properly qualified doctor in which cases which were tee serious for her to deal with, whether connected with mid- -wifery or not. She was also warned that the State physician, Dr. Holmes, would pay occasional visits to her clinic, and satisfy himself that it was properly conducted.

JoUit, Th i s woman was previously employed by the American Mission for ^yW several years as a hospital nurse. She is I believe fully trained in maternity work. Some five years ago she left the Mission, after a disagreement, and set up as a midwife. She accompanied the family of H.E. Shaikh Hamed to England in 1926. On various occasions during the last two years it has been reported to me that she is in the habit of carrying out illegal operations. She has set up a sort of private hospital in a house in the town and this establishment has a somewhat unsatisfactory reputation. About six months ago I heard that Sundri had cut off the leg of a woman at lessra. withdut consulting any of the regular doctors. I sent for her and she admitted this, saying that the r; doctors of the Mission were away at the time and the patient male doctor. I told her that if anything of this -X would not see a male doctor. sort was reported to me again I should take a serious view of it. I told her that she should always consult one o e regular doctors in serious cases. This she promised to do lately she attended one of the sepoys* wives at the Rort I gather that she caused an abortion.A f should be visited occasionally by a doctor, preferably Doctor Holmes.
