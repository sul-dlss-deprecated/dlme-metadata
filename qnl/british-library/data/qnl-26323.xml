'Now that the director of the German ’Lufthansa’ Baron von Gablenz has returned from his experimental flight Berlin-Tokyo-Berlin, preparations for opening a regular service between Berlin and the Siamese capital of Bangkok have advanced far enough to start weekly flights in the course of this year. The distance of more than ten thousand kilometres from Berlin to Bangkok is to be covered in four days and fifteen hours and a half, including the time needed for ten landings and night stops at Damascus, Basrah, Karachi and Calcutta'. 2. Prom enquiries which I have made I gather that the above information is correct. The Germans have agreed to accept the Aerial Transport Company of Siam as their agents here, but I have it on good authority that they will at the same time keep an office of their own at Bangkok, which will for administrative purposes be the area headquarters of the Lufthansa Company in this part of the world.

My Lord, I have the honour to report that, upon the receipt of ^ your saving telegram No. 1_of January 3rd. last, I called upon Prince Varnvaidya at the Foreign Office and asked him to be so good as to supplement the information which he had previously furnished to me by telling me what stipulations, if any, were being made by the Siamese Government with respect to reciprocal aviation rights in connexion with the negotiations now pending for the operation of Japanese and German civil air services to or via Siam. 2. Prince Varnvaidya complied readily with my request he said that the proposed agreement witn the Japanese Govern ment gave to the Siamese the definite right to operate a service of their own to Formosa, but tnat the right to operate such a service to Japan or to other territories under Japanese administration was made 'subject to special agreement 4 '. The Siamese would be content with this so long as Bangkok remained the terminal port of the Japanese service, but if, as was foreshadowed, an extension of that service was going to be made to Singapore, then they would ask for the right to extend their own operations beyond Formosa. 3. Mth respect to tne German negotiations, the Prince said that they hod been conducted on the basis of full reciprocity, but that no mention was made in the draft agreement/ The Right Honourable Viseount Halifax, K.G*, G.C.b.I., G.C.l.A*, etc*, etc., etc.agreement of the right of the SlameBe to operate a service to German territory* The suggestion had been made that such a stipulation might be inserted, but on reflexion it had not been thought worth while for reasons which tne Prince explained to me* There was no thought, he said, of the Siamese inaugurating an air line to Germany, Just as in the case of the agreement over Imperial Airways there had never been any idea of their asking for the right to operate one to the United Kingdom; all that had been requested from ourselves was authority for them to go to Burma and India so far as tne estern route from Bangkok was concerned* As there were no intermediate German possessions between Siam and Germany itself, there seemed no point in any allusion in tne draft agreement to the granting of aviation rights to the Siamese. Moreover, the projected German service was not supposed to go beyond Bangkok, although, if a proposal were put forward that it should do so, the Siamese might wish to reconsider the question of a sufficient quid ,iro quo for themselves* As it was and in order to redress the existing balance as regards compensation, the draft agreement with Germany provided for more in the way of training facilities for Siamese officers than had been obtained from us* The Germans were undertaking that as many as six such officers at a time should be admitted by them to courses of t raining and instruction designed for officers of the Navy, Army and Air Force, as well as to courses of training and instruction in chemical science and industry. In a letter attached to the draft agreement it was laid down that these latter courses should include ’’chemical warfare’’* Furthermore, there was a clause in the agreement that the German Government would do its best to encourage a greater export of merchandise from Siam to Germany, with a view to adjusting the existing unequal balance of trade* 4./4# Prince Varnvaidye sent for the draft of the German agreement at one point in our conversation, in order to refresh his memory. He had no objection to my reading it and I was thus able to confirm hat he had told me. It was made valid for two years and in most respects it appeared to be identical with the one which we have concluded ourselves. Although it did not specify in so many words that the officers despatched to Germany would be trained free of charge, it was understood. Prince Varnvaidya told me, that this would be the case and Pr. Goebbeis had even sent a cordial invitation for them to be sent 5. In response to a final enquiry, the Prince said that the negotiations with both Japan and Ge&lt; lany had not as yet gone beyond the stage reported to four Lordship in my despatch No. 516 (72/30/58) of November 30th. last. 6.

A huge German plane arrived at the Tachikawa aerodrome near Tokyo on the evening of the 30th November, having completed the trip from Berlin in forty-six hours. For five days the members of the crew had to undergo continuous celebrations. The German Ambassador said that he hoped the Condor’s achievement would be the forerunner of the establishment of a regular air service between Germany and Japan. The Foreign Minister said that the flight testified to the prestige of German aviation and the excellent technique and high efficiency of the plane. The Yomiuri remarked that 'the amazing success of the German Condor plane symbolises the wonderful vigour of the rising German nation.” The members of the crew, in the numerous speeches they had to make, emphasised the reliability of the machine - even if two out of the four engines broke down. The plane could continue on the remaining two. The Japan Air Transport Company ordered five Condor planes from the Focke- Wulff* Company, to be paid for, in the country’s present straitened finances, with soya beans. Meanwhile the Italians, whose goodwill plane had broken down at Beirut a few days previously, must have looked on with envy at all the flag- waving and speech-making. 371. The Condor fell into the sea, however, shortly before reaching Manila on its homeward journey. The plane may have been able to fly with two engines, but it had a single petrol feed and when a blockage occurred there was nothing for it but to try to make a forced landing. Nobody was drowned or even hurt. The plane was raised from the sea-bed a few days later full of sand and in two pieces. The crew and what remained of the plane were shipped down to Germany.Jn any further communication on this subjeot, please quote N ° F lit OS I 0 and address— no( to any person by name, bi» to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.VV. 1. i ) s 8414 Folios 8 ffairj INDIA DIRECT presents his hv rlireetinmnf t, THE Under-Secretary of State fo compliments to by direction^ of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop uU of the under-mentioned paper.

Mr. L^nis ier pointed out that there were many fortified areas in Tonkin* that more were being created and that, in view of the present aggressive policy of the Japanese in South China and the strained relations existing between them and the French, the latter were not unwilling to allow Japanese pilots to fly regularly over the areas in question. He said that it might not be without significance that the Siamese desired the right to push their service, via Fort Bayard, right up to the frontier between Indo-china and China. They alleged as the reason for this de ire the large proportion of Chinese among the population of 31am, and their wish to increase their prestige with these people by operating a service ultimately right into China# Monsieur h^plssler admitted that this request had been made prior to the fall of canton, since when it had not been dismissed* He did not know how far the latent developments in Couth China might have modified the Siamese attitude in this rea &gt;ect. a* copies of this des&gt;atch are being forwarded to: The Department of overseas Trade (by air mail)| the Governor- General of Indiaj the Governor of Burma; the Governor of the Straits Settlements; the oovernor-of Hong Kong; His Majesty*s Ambassador at Tokyo; His Majesty* s Arabassaclor at Shanghai, the Vice-Admiral Comnanding-in-Chief on the China Station; the General Officer Gommanding the Troops, Malaya Comriand,Singapore; the Air Vice-Marshal Commanding the Royal Air Force, Far East, Singapore; the General Officer Commanding, Burma; the Chief of the General Staff, India; and the Naval, Military and Air Attach^, Ban^cok.

These statements led me to make enquiry yesterday as to the progress of the negotiations now proceeding to that end from Prince Varnvaidya* the Adviser to the Foreign Office here, who is the official in charge of them. The Prince was good enough to furnish me with the following information in confidencei 2. The Japanese wished to operate a service between “ )rmosa and Bangkok via Hanoi, and they hoped to be able to extend it as far as Singapore 0 They had not, so far as the Prince was aware, obtained the consent either of ourselves or of the French to this arrangement, but their Siamese before approaching the French or British Governments. The Japanese Minister here had been informed that the Siamese Government were willing to conclude with him a reciprocal arrangement on the lines of that already effected in the case of Imperial Airways; the Aerial Transport Company of Siam would be the Japanese company's agents, and there would be a idea was, apparently, to come to an agreement with th® stipulation The Kight Honourable Viscount Halifax, K.G., GpCoSoIc, G.C.I.E., etc.. etc., etc.(I II ft stipulation as to free facilities being available for the training of Siamese air pilots in Japan. Prince Varnvaidya thought that this latter stipulation had been made more or less pro forma 9 and it was his impression that the Ministry of Defence would in practice prefer England to Japan as a place of training for officers of the Siamese Air Force. With respect to Germany, the idea was that a service should be operated between Europe and Bangkok via Rangoon; ho had not heard of an extension beyond Bangkok and, whilst admitting the probability of my suggestion that Bangkok might be made a point of junction between future German and Japanese services, he said that no proposals for any such collaboration were known to him and that the negotiations with the Japanese and German Legations were taking place independently® Like the Japanese, the Germans had been told that Siam was prepared to sign with them a reciprocal agreement on the Imperial Airways model# The Aerial Transport Company of Siam in this case also would be the local agents, but the stipulation as to training facilities was rather different« The German Government were being asked to pror’ise facilities for the higher training of Siamese military officers, as well as for education in the military aspects of chemistry; the Prince said with a laugh that this latter formula had been invented by himself to meet the wishes of the Minister of Defence, and that it was meant to imply education in ’'chemical warfare'. My German colleague had told him that he did not anticipate difficulty with his own Government over the Siamese proposals, and, provided that the Germans could reachreach an agreement with ourselves as to transit across India and Burma, he supposed that we might see the inauguration of a German service in the immediate future. There was likely to he delay in the case of the Japanese, who would have to come to an understanding with the French and ourselves before their plan could he realised* He believed that both the Germans and the Japanese had in mind weekly services to begin with. 3. Prince Varnvaidya added that the Siamese had insisted firmly that their own company (the Aerial Transport Company of Siam) should be the agents in this country for both services. There had been some little difficulty on this point, ov/ing to the circumstance that Mr. Jackson, the Operations Manager of the company named, is a Canadian The Japanese had done no more than make enquiries as to Mr. Jackson’s nationality and reputation for impartiality, but the Germans had gone further and, for alleged administrative reasons, bad expressed the desire that their agency should be in the hands of the Bangkok German firm of Windsor and Company 0 This suggestion had, however, been rejected. 4. The French and Dutch air services via Glam are still operating on the old provisional basis. The Aerial Transport Company of Siam represent Air France, but the K.L.M. are represented by a local Dutch firm (the Holland-Siam Trading Company). Prince Varnvaidya said that the Dutch also would have to consent to be represented by the Siamese company when it came to negotiating a to continue their present arrangement with the Dutch company for the first year* The Dutch, he said, were anxious to go on to Hong Kongo/ 8413 I958 5.' I should mention two other conditions laid down 'by the Siamese as regards the Japanese service* As with Imperial Airways, the Japanese must make Udon their stopping place between Hanoi and Bangkok* Furthermore, they must carry without charge the mails Detween Bangkok and Udoni Prince Varnvaidya said that this second condition might not he enforced, as the Aerial Transport Company of Siam were protesting against it, on the ground that it would mean the loss of the subsidy which they are now drawing themselves for the transport of the mails in question* 6.

My Lord In my confidential despatch No. 171 (72/8/38) of May 3rd last, I alluded to the possibility of the Japanese endeavouring to inaugurate an air service between Formosa and Bangkok via Hanoi. In this connexion, I have just received the following information in strict secrecy from Mr. Jackson, the Operations Manager of the Aerial Transport Company of Siam, which is, as Your Lordship knows, a Siamese company itself operating internal services in this country, and which acts as the local agent for Messrs. Imperial Airways and Air Force. 2. Mr. Jackson said that, some little time ago, the Japanese Minister here, Mr. Murai, invited Phya Chalerm Akas, the Chief of the Siamese Division of Civil Aviation, to corne and see him. It was a question, apparently, of the Siamese Government having insisted that, in the event of a Japanese service to Bangkok being inaugurated, its agent here must be the Aerial Transport Company. Mr. Murai accordingly wished to discuss the personnel of the Company with Phya Chalerm Akas, who found him with a copy of the 'Bangkok Directory' before him, looking up the information Viscount Halifax, K.G., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., etc., etc., etc.,■i concerning it which appears in that publication. Mr. Murai enquired who were the foreigners on the Company^ staff, and was told that they consisted of a ground engineer in the employ of Messrs. Imperial Airways and of Mr. Jackson. With respect to the latter, Mr. Murai asked whether he was English or American, and was told that he was neither, but a GanadianI I am not aware of what else was said, but Mr. Murai must have made some impression upon Phya Chalerm Akas, for the latter came back and, in telling Mr. Jackson of Mr. Murai f s enquiry about him, emphasised that he (Mr. Jackson) in his capacity of an employee of the Aerial Transport Company must forget that he was even 'Canadian” and must be wholly Siamese. 3. It would thus appear that the Japanese are still occupied with the idea of an air service to Bangkok. As far as Mr. Jackson knows, however, neither they nor the Germans have reached an agreement upon the subject with the Siamese Government, which will in any event stipulate that the Aerial Transport Company shall be the agent for any services that may be established. 4.

A draft of the permit proposed to be given for the operation of this service across India is enclosed. In that the permit should be subject to annual renewal.

The Governments of India and Burma have been given to understand that they would be consulted about the details of the authorization for the German service (see d.o. letters at P.Z. 4192 and B.4000). One possible course would be to communicate again with the German Government at once through the diplomatic channel confirming the previous correspondence subject to a further exchange of notes in regard to the detailed conditions of the authorization, but on the whole it seems best to defer approaching the German Government again until we are in a position to give them a final reply after consultation with India and Burma. I gather from the Northern Department that the Foreign Office would prefer the latter course. If you concur it is suggested that (so far, at any rate, as the Government of India are concerned; the E. &amp; 0.

German Air Service to the Far East * The Committee had under consideration Paper I.A.C. 484, circulated by the Air Ministry, regarding the request from the German Air Ministry for authorisation for the flight over British India on the Berlin-Bangkok route. The Committee agreed that the terms of the German reply were satisfactory and that the Governments of India and Burma should be asked to grant formal authorisations for the German service.7. Suggested British Air Service to Japan . The Coramittee had tinder consideration Paper I.A.C. 480, circulated hy the Air Ministry, regarding a proposal to extend the British air line from Hong Kong to Japan. In the course of discussion it v/as pointed out that the United Kingdom had already told Japan that a service to Hong Kong would he permitted if a British one were allowed to operate to a suitable point in Japan, such as Pukuska or Osaka, and that the initiative had in fact been left to the Japanese. The question could, of course, be raised by H.M. Ambassador very informally in the course of his customary talks with the Japanese; but if the United Kingdom were to resume the initiative and press for the suggested facilities, the Committee felt that the Japanese would, no doubt, in return ask for rights to fly to Singapore, or possibly to Bangkok to link up with the German services. Altogether, the advantages of linking up to Japan were felt to be much less than the disadvantages of admitting Japanese influence into Malaya; and it was, moreover, doubted whether the United Kingdom was at present in a position to inaugurate a service to Japan. After some discussion the Committee agreed that the various aspects of the matter should be put to H.M. Ambassador, who should be warned against entering into negotiations with the Japanese on the subject.(UJ2iP. 6_ Extract from Minutes of the 61st Meeting of the Inter-Departmental Committee on International Air Communications, held on 5th October, 1938, Proposed Air Service between Yunnanfu and Burma * The Committee had under consideration papers I.A.C.473, 474, 478 and 479, circulated by the Air Ministry, on this subject. Their attention was drawn to the Ambassador’s view that the United Kingdom should maintain its insistence upon an assurance that when conditions permitted a British Company would be granted reciprocal facilities to operate beyond Yunnanfu to Hong Kong and Shanghai. With regard to the suggestion that the Sino- German 'Eurasia” Company should be replaced by a Sino- British Company, Sir George Mounsey felt that if the German element in Eurasia were liquidated without any pressure from the United Kingdom there could be no objection to the United Kingdom participating in a Sino- British Company, but it would not be desirable in present circumstances to be active in ousting the Germans. On the question of the assurance to be extracted from the Chinese, Sir Y/illiam Brown felt that the Railv/ay discussions now going on with the Export Credits Guarantee Department (while they were not expected to lead to any definite outcome) indicated that the Chinese were very anxious to develop communications via Burma and that therefore the United Kingdom demands could be maintained with some likelihood of success. Sir Donald Banks also felt that it was desirable to approach the Chinese again, maintaining the request for Imperial Airways to fly right into China on a reciprocal basis, but leaving the door open for the subsequent form ation of a Sino-British Company on United Kingdom terms, i.e. without the provision for expropriation included in paragraph 3 of the Minister of Communications latest proposals/proposals (l.A.C. 474)* He pointed out that to entertain the idea of a Sino-British Company at this juncture would he impossible owing to the war situation and to the fact that its aircraft would at once be exposed to attack by the Japanese. After some discussion, it v/as agreed that the Chinese Government should be approached again on the basis of a service into China by Imperial Airways, without the exclusion of other alternatives when it was seen how the situation developed. The Air Ministry and Foreign Office representatives undertook to circulate a draft of the proposed instructions to the Burma Office for consideration before despatch.P.Z. 7158/38 SECRET Extract from Peshawar Y/eekly Intelligence Summary, No.40, dated 3rd October, 1938.
