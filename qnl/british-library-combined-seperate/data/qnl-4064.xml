The correspondence concerns the transfer of the estate and property of Shaikh Isa bin Ali Al Khalifah [Shaikh ‘Īsá bin ‘Alī Āl Khalīfah] to his son, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifah [Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah] upon the former's death in 1932, and from Shaikh Hamad to his son, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifah [Shaikh Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah] after Hamad's death in 1942. The need for the transfer, which was certified by the Political Agent, Bahrain, arose from the existence of shares in the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company Limited in Shaikh Isa's name, and of War Stock held in Shaikh Hamad's name with The Eastern Bank Limited.Folio 11 is internal office notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Khalīfah (Family)</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000013#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000013#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000013#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
