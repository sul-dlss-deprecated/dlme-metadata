Department of Educations, Health and Lands. He® Delhi, the 16th March, 1932. , Press Communique. In a Press Communique dated the 23rd January&gt; 1932, it was stated that the Hejaz Government would for this year's Haj % collect at gold rate all charges included in their pilgrimage tariff, which was then estimated at about Rs.800, allowing a reasonable margin for the transport charges which had not been fixed, and that the expenses of a pilgrim, including the cost of his railway and steamer tickets and food both ways would, calculated at the rate of Rs .20 per gold pound, amount to Rs.1,100. Statements have since appeared in the Press casting doubts on the accuracy of this estimate and asserting that Rs .750 will as in the past suffice for a pilgrim's expenses. The Government of India have therefore obtained further confirmation from His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Jedda that the decision | of the Hejaa Government to collect all charges shown in their tariff on a gold basis at the curunt market rate has not been altered and that the facts stated in the previous Communique Or are correct. If a pilgrim performs all his journeys in^Hejaz by camel and without luggage and practises most rigid economy, he may be able to perform the pilgrimage for Rs .900 as an absolute minimum, but in no other circumstances will the cost of the pilgrimage this year be less than Rs.1,100 per pilgrim, is it is reported that m any pilgrims have already arrived in Jedda with smaller funds than this and will in consequence be put to great distress, all intending pilgrims are warned of the facts of the case*. They should understand that if they arrive with inadequate funds, they cannot be given any financial assistance by the British Legation nor can they expect any remission of dues payable under the Hejaz Government's tariff.I -■ . a No:. Political Agency, Bahrain,the 19th •June 1932. To, i Mr.Shafi al Rahman, Bachhvaon.,Di s t Moradabad, U.P.,India. Dear Sir, Please refer to your letter of the 13th Ifey 1932. Nothing short of a Guide Book would provide a Beply to all the questions you have raised and I regret that I am unable to answer them seriatim. I can,however, tell you that the pilgrim route from Bahrain to Mecca, / across the desert,has not yet been developed and that this year the Hedjaz-Najd Government took steps to prevent pilgrims from going along it. There are no khans,caravan serais or other facilities along the route. The route itself is dangerous and in the event of a car breaking down in the Dahana between Hasa and Riadh,the passengers would very probably die of thirst. An Indian of any position would find the journey by camel most uncomfortable and inconvenient and,even supposing he could acquire the camel,he would find his ignorance of Arabic a great handi cap unless he was able to find someone who could interpret for him. As regards safety. The conditions are now much better than they have been in the past or are likely to be in the future and robberies and raids very seldom occur. I personally consider this way,even if pi*acticable,would be more expensive than the normal route via the Hedjaz, and unless a pilgrim is supplied with ample funds,he would not be allowed to land in Bahrain and would consequently waste his time and incur trouble for nothing. My■0 152' My Assistant,Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiy al Hashimi, will probably be able to ^ive you any further information you require.

The Saudi and Iraqi delegates at the Pilgrimage Commission referred to above, stated that their Governments were anxious that these routes should be kept closed to pilgrims. It,is doubtful, however, whether this can be done, since the beginning of the routes lies in territory which does not belong to either Government. I am to suggest that it would be useful to consult His Majesty 1 s representative at Koweit with a view to ascertaining the extent to which they may be increasingly used in the future, more precisely the extent to which these routes are now used,^andthe possibility of obtaining some measure of control of pilgrims using the routes, or, alternatively, of closing the routes altogether to pilgrim traffic. At the same time, I am to suggest that infomation should be obtained on the questions whether ports a^ong the southern shore of the Persian Gulf, particularly Bahrein, are being use, and, if so, to what extent, by pilgrims proceeding^ to Saudi Arabia, and whether it would be possible to establish some form of sanitary The Under Secretary of State, India Office,S.¥.l.2. control of pilgrims at these ports before the pilgrims begin their overland journey.

Before the war pilgrim traffic from the northwest was canalised by the Hedjaa Railway, but after the destruction of the railway most pilgrims from Syria, Palestine, and other countries to the west went by sea to the Hedjaa. A number, however, had always used the land routes on foot, and the advent of the motor car rendered the further development of these routes imminent• At a meeting held at the Foreign Office on January 7th, it was agreed that it would probably be desirable that sanitary control posts should be established on the TransJordan territory near the frontier on each route, at Afcaba, Mudawwara and Quasr The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W.I, MINISTRY OF HSATH V WHITEHALL, S.W.I. 12th March, 1936.Azraq# It is possible that measures for sanitary control are now being oarried out at these or other points on these routes, but I am to suggest that it would be desirable to ascertain from the High Comcaissioner of Transi^ordan what sanitary measures are in fact already in force, and to consult him as to the possibility of instituting machinery for a further and better control along the routes in question.

(2) From Koweit - (c) Koweit - Hiyadh - Mecca, With regard to routes (a) and (b), despite the claims of the Iraqi Health Service, there appe ars to be little sanitary control or immunisation against disease of pilgrims on the outward journey from Iraq. On the return journey it is understood that pilgrims are isolated for a day or two, but not long enough to avoid all danger of their carrying infection to their homes. According to the report of the Quarantine Board of Egypt, referred to above, (pages 33 to 37), the Hejef etc. route, which is likely zo become much the most important of the land routes in future, depends mainly on wells for its water supply, and there is a very material danger ofthe pollution of these wells by pilgrims carrying epidemic disease. It is considered, therefore,desirable to impress upon the Iraqi Government the The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.I,urgency of establishing really effective sanitary control, end I am to suggest that in the first place as full and accurate information as possible be obtained as to the sanitary conditions along the route, and the preventive measures ?vhioh are taken as regards pilgrims on the outward journey and the quarantine measures imposed on the homeward journey, and that in the second place the attention 01 the Iracji Government should be drawn to the risks of the carriage of epidemic disease along these routes, and to the danger that would arise from a neglect of all the necessary precautions to ensure the health of the pilgrims using the routes.

Consequently they may convey infection on board a healthy ship or form a nucleus which is highly susceptible to infection, tfhile the Saudi Arabian Government claim that these pilgrims, together with the rest of the pilgrims on board who have undergone quarantine measures bef(re embarkation at the port of origin, are inspected by their quarantine staff before being permitted to disembark at Jeddah, and undergo immunisation if that has not already been done, it is felt that this is not a sufficient measure of protection and does not conform to the internationally accepted rule that pilgrims destined for the Holy Places should undergo the necessary quarantine measures at the place of original embarkation in order to reduce as far as possible the susceptible population entering the Hedjaz. At the discussions which took place in Paris and at a meeting which was held at the Foreign Office on the 7th Januery it was suggested that the Gorernments of the countrie s of origin The Secretary, Board of Trade, Great George Street, S.W.I. (&gt; MINISTRY OP HEALTH, WHITEHALL, S.W.I. 12th March, 1936.of the pilgrims should come to an understanding with the shipping companies wherehy the latter would undertake not to embark pilgrims en route • The representative ot the GoTernment of India stated, however, that he doubted whether this would 'be possible since there is no machinery available for enforcing such a requirement and ships which conform to the terms of the International Sanitary Convention of 19E6 as regards accommodation and other requirements laid down in the case of pilgrim ships have to be accepted as such without question. It msy be possible, however, to secure what is desired by other means, and I am to ask that the Minister may xiave the benefit of the opinion of the Board of Trade on the matter.

Reference to preTious correspondence: Mr. Cleary 1 s letter to Mr. Brenan of 16th January. Description of Bnclosure. Kame and Date. Foreign Office Minute 5th March. Subject. Interdepartmental meeting to discuss questions connected with the pilgrimage to the Hedjaz. Similar letter sent to Ministry of Health Colonial Office, Board of Trade^An interdepartmental meeting was held at the Foreign Office in Mr, Renders room at 3.30 p.m. on the 7th January, 1936, to discuss the following questions connected with the pilgrimage to the Hejaz: (1) The institution of a proper sanitary control oyer pilgrims on the rapidly developing land routes to the Hejaz. (8) The prevention of intermediate calls at ports in the Yema^ Asir and the Southern Hejaz by pilgrim ships coming from the Kast. The following were present j- Mr. Rendel (in the chair) Mr. Brenan, Foreign Office Mr. Ward Dr. M.T. Morgan, Ministry of Health Mr. Blaxter, Colonial Office Mr. Cleary, India Office. 2. The meeting had before it (a) a letter of the 21st November from Dr. M.T. Morgan, Ministry of Health (United Kingdom representative on the Pilgrimage Commission of the International Public Health Office at Paris), to Mr. Hendel, in which was enclosed a copy of the official report of the Commission (b) the report on the 1935 Pilgrimage published by the Alexandria quarantine Board. 3. The meeting first considered question (1) above. Dr. Morgan said that it was in his view very important to take up without delay the question of instituting proper sanitary control over the land routes owing to the likelihood of their rapid development in the near future by motor transport/transport and the encouragement which the Government of Saudi- Arabia and the neighbouring Middle Eastern countries were apparently giving to them. He felt that if the authorities concerned failed to take adequate measures to see that persons setting out for the pilgrimage by these routes were properly immunized against cholera and smallpox and made to pass on their return from the pilgrimage through a proper period of quarantine to ensure that they did not spread infection picked up in the Hejaz, there would eventually be an epidemic which would render * nugatory all the elaborate and expensive sanitary control of pilgrims travelling to and from the Hejaz by sea. Dr • Morgan said that there appeared to be at present seven different land routes followed by pilgrims to the Hejaz; A. Houtes from the northwest to the He.1a2&gt; (Pilgrims entering Saudi Arabia by these routes are obliged to cross Transjordan territory at some point); The following three routes were used, (a) Maan - Akaba and thence along the coast of the northern Hejaz; (b) Maan - Tebuk along the ruined Hejax Railway (the route followed in old days by the annual pilgrim caravan from Damascus); (c) ^asrel Azraq - Wadi Sirhan - Tebuk and then along the Hejaz Railway as for (b) above. Before the war pilgrim traffic from the northwest was canalised by the Hejaz Railway, The destruction of the railway meant that most pilgrims from Syria, Palestine and other countries to the west went by sea to the Hejaz, But a number had always used the land routes on foot, and the advent of the motor car rendered the further development of these routes imminent, e.g, two pioneer parties from Syria had motored along routes (b) and (c) during the last pilgrim season, and the Saudi Government were said/said to be improving the difficult section of the track along the southern part of the Hejaz railway. The meeting agreed that it would probably be desirable for sanitary control posts to be established on the Transjordan territory near the frontier on each route, i.e. at Akaba, Mudawwara and Q,a8r@l Aj&amp;raq.# The first thing, however, was to ask the High Gomdssioner for Transjordan what sanitary measures were already in force in regard to pilgrims crossing' or leaving Transjordan and to consult him as to the possibility of instituting further control, and the Ministry of Health would set the machinery in motion by raising the matter officially with the Colonial Office, keeping the Foreign Office informed. B. Routes from the north east . (1) From Iraq. (d) Hejaf Hail ^ Medina (following for the most part the ancient pilgrim route from Iraq which the Iraqi Government are now trying to develop for motor transport); (e) Basra - Zobeir - Anaxza - Mecca. (2) From Koweit. (f) Koweit - .Riyadh - Mecca. As regards (d) and (e). Dr. Morgan said that despite the claims of the Iraqi Health Service there appeared to be virtually no sanitary control or immunisation of pilgrims on the outward journey from Iraq. On the return journey he understood thet pilgrims were isolated for a day or two, but not long enough to avoid all danger of their carrying infection to their homes. It appeared from the report on route (d) embodied in pages 35-37 of the report of the Alexandria quarantine Board for 1935 that this route, which was likely to become much the most important of the land routes in future, depended mainly on wells for its water supply and this rendered the danger of pollution very grave. Dr. Morgan thought that it was most desirable to bring home to the Iraqi Government the urgency of establishing really effective/effective sanitary control and it was agreed that the Ministry of Health should write officially to the Foreign Office on the subject with a view to instructions toeing sent to His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdaa 1© approach the Iraqi Government. As regards route (f) (from Koweit), Br. Morgan said that the Saudi ana Iraqi delegates at the meeting of the Pilgrim Cofiimission in iParis had told the Commission that their Governments were anxious to see this route icept closed. Mr. Hendel pointed out that this desire doubtless arose from political motives, and he suggested that it would be preferable to induce the Sheikh of Koweit to establish proper medical control rather than to attempt to keep the route close. It was agreed, however, that the first step was to consult the British authorities in the Persian Gulf and to ascertain the extent to which this route was used by pilgrims, and what medical facilities already existed at Koweit which might be utilised for their control.The Ministry of Health would therefore raise the matter officially with ,the India Office in the first instance, keeping the Foreign Office informed. 8. Q. ticute from the east . (g) Uquir or - Hasa - Riyadh - Mecca. fhis route lay entirely within Saudi territory which rendered tne provision of adequate control more difficult. The route was, however, lively to become important, especially for pilgrims from British India and the Far East; a/iifficulty had # already arisen over a number of destitute Indian pilgrims who had used this route to return from the pilgrimage. Mr. Rendel A • suggested that it should be possible to impose proper sanitary control on most of the pilgrims using this route as they would almost certainly nave to pass Bahrein, where the special relations of the Sheikh with His Majesty's Government and the rapidly / : ^ developing/developing facillties on the Island, would render It coaparatlvely simple to make the necessary arrangements. It might be possible to insist that all British Imlan pilgrims should pass through Bahrein both outwards and homewards. It was agreed that this rafttter should also be raised by the Ministry of Health with the India Office with a view to the consultation of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The Foreign Office would be kept informed. 9» The possibility was also mentioned of oilgrlms utilising another ancient caravan route via the sea ports in the Aden Protectorate, the Hadhramaut valley, the eastern foothills of the Yemen to Sanaa, thence along the usual land route from the Yemen to Mecca* It was felt, however, that althou^i a certain number of Hadhramia doubtless used this route, it was unlikely to be used by pilgrims from outside Arabia who could make the journey much more easily and safely byasa. It was arranged, however, that the Colonial Office should ask the Resident at Aden for any information which he could give on the matter* 10. The Meeting then considered question (2) on the agenda dealing with an aspect of the transport of pilgrims by sea. Dr. Morgan said that pilgrim ships approaching the Hejaa from the north were sdequetely covered by existing arrangements at Tor and Moses Wells and he had no point to raise. Pilgrim ships approaching the He jag from the south were obliged to make a call at the quarantine station at Kamaran, but the advantage of this control and of the preventive measures taken at the place of embarkation In India was impaired by the practice which had arisen of ships making intermediate calls to pick up pilgrims, both before and sfter touching at Kamaran, at small ports on the coast of the Yemen, Asir end the southern Hejaz. Medical control was non-existent at auch ports and the risk of infection being brought on board and spreading among the mainbody of pilgrims, was considerable, even in cases of pilgrims taken on board before touching at Kamaran, since it would not always be possible for the quarantine staff there to pick them out from the other pilgrims with a view to special examination# Dr. Morgan suggested that it might be possible to control Indian ships by the Government of India withholding licences to shipping companies to carry pilgrims unless they undertook to refrain from this practice. Action with British companies would be a matter for the Board of Trade ( Note ; owing to a misunderstanding the Board of Trade were not represented at the meeting), but there remained the question of Dutch and other foreign steamers. !!• Mr. Gleary thought that it might be difficult for the Government of India to put compulsion on the Indian shipowners; at the same time the India Office would of course put the matter before them. Mr. Eendel said that provided adequate steps had already been taken to £ top this practice among British and British Indian shipping, it would no doubt be possible for the Foreign Office to approach foreign Governments concerned and request them to take similar measures ^ith their own shipping companies. The Meeting agreed that the next step should therefore be for the Ministry of Health to write officially to the India Office and the Board of Trade on this aspect of the matter, keeping the Foreign Office informed. 12. Dr. Morgan also alluded to the long-standing question of the transport of pilgrims by dhow from Sritrea. Owing to the Italo-Abyssinian war this traffic had much decreased and he did not think that any further representations to the Italian Government were necessary at the moment, even if it were practicable to make them in present circumstances, which was doubtful. The Meeting agreed with this view.Ifo. E. 1392/27/25.

Viceroy of India* I have the honour to enclose herein a Memorandum prepared in this Legation on the subject of destitute Indian pilgrims» Such persons are a source of considerable embarrassment to this Legation, and of seme expense to the G-overnment of India s whose name., moreover, they tend to bring into disrepute. I should be grateful if the suggestions contained in the memorandum, with which I am in agreement^ could be examined by the proper quarters, and if I could be informed of^the result in due course. 2* The general Attitude of the Saudi Arabian Govern ment is that while, for religious reasons, they are reluctant to debar any Moslem from performing the pilgrimage, they do their best to discourage and sometimes to remove forcibly any pilgrim who cannot pay the usual fees. It would therefore be in the interest of good relations if the number of destitutes could be reduced as far as possible, and I trust that all possible steps will be taken to that end. 5,, The External Affairs Department is no doubt aware of the article published in Seyyid Ismail Ghaznavi's paper 'Khadim- i-Kaaba' dated the 27th May 1938 concerning destitute pilgrims. The writer seems to agree thM» it is nocsssary to discourage destitute pilgrims from making the pilgrimage, and he quotes quite correctly the number of d^laiitutes repatriated and the cost to official funds during the last fmr years. His remedy . appears to be that the Government of India, instead of inter fering with pilgrims, should assist them by paying their fares for them: thou^a how this would lessen expense it is difficult to see.Moaiorandum concerning destitute Indian pilgrims. On the 11th August 1937 a report reached this Legation that three Indians were in the Jedda gaol having been arrested at Mecca. Subsequent reports raised the number to five, me being a v/oman.. On the 13th September 1937 a letted ms received from a CQrbain Abdur-Rahman Sylhiti ? who wrote from Mecca to say that his father, Muhammad Nusratullahfc son of Baqratullah ? an Indian ? together vdth two Indian companions named Muhammad Qabil and his wife Musammat A^esha 3 had been arrested by the Saudi authorities at Medina and had not since been heard of* The writer said that tho three persons mentioned had travelled on the Pilgrimage on foot with no passports he himself had come with them but ho had a passport &gt; Subsequent enquiries appeared to show that the three pilgrims were no longer in prison at Jedda on tho 18th September* A report dated September 19th indicated tfeh of the five Indians who had been in prison two had been sent saibout a fort« night previously in a dhow towards the Yemen: and that the other three, including the woman $ were similarly dealt with a week later. An enquiry from the Saudi authorities remained unanswered for a long times finally an answer ?7as received saying that the Saudi Arabian Government knew nothing about them. In April 1938 it was once more reported that some Indian pilgrims were in the Jedda gaol, and that they were being deported in a dhow to tho Yemen, where they were to be let loose to find their own way back to India« Further information was furnished . . a in April 1938 by a certain Ibaratullah who applied for repatriation as a destitute a His story was as follows: About two years ago he left Bombay with eight other Indians to make the pilgrimage» Some of tho party (at least four) obtained pilgrim passes* They travelled on foot* got passages in a dhow {sailing somewhere between Karachi and Gwadur, and landing at Muscat, or Makalla, or somgi other port in South Arabia) and eventually proceeded on foot via the Yemeni They reached Mecca safely and left their baggage in a house in the Misfala guarterO) of Mecca. On attempting to perform the 'tawaf' the police arrested tiiem.^ Tliey v /ere interrogated in the Hamidiyeh or secretariat and were told that they must produce sureties or bo sent to prison* A member of the party who came from Sylhet (Assam) was allowed to go out to find a surety, and he returned with a man who stood guarantor for the whole party J they were then released* During the next month five of them went to Medina. At tho ond of the month they were all summoned agp.in ~ to the Secretariat and a gain examined. Tho four who wora in Mecca went to tho Secretariat where their passes mro demanded* Two of them had passes of a sort and wore released* The other two were detained there, and appear to have been imprisoned for some time. Nothing further is known of their fate. Of the five vjho had gone to Medina two eventually returned to Mecca, where they produced passes and therefore were not detained. When Ibaratullah asked them about tho fate of the other throe who went to Medina, they replied that those three persons, tfho had no passes, had been arrested and sent by car to Mecca, Ibarat- vllah and his friends endeavoured to find out from the police what happened to the five pilgrims then in prison, but tho only answer they received was that they had been sont back to their country• The remaining four continued to liv© at Mecca for some weeks in a 'Poor House': their finger-prints wore taken and &gt; five pounds gold was demanded from each ono» Ibaratullah managed to induce one of his friends to pay this sum for him, and he was reloasod* He made his way to Jedda, where he ms eventually repatriated at the expanse of the Government of India. As for the other throe, Ibaratullah states that they were taken by car to Jedda, and after some days wore put on a dhow travelling to some unknown destination-. The dhow anchored one night at a mlm® near the shores the three pilgrims succeeded/succoodod in landing unobsorvod and mdo thoir way back to Mocca on foot. Nothing further has boon heard of thorn: ihoyrappoar to havo minglod with the rost of tho pilgrims and to havo porformod tho Haj this yoais It sooms probablo that tho fivo porsona montionod by Ibaratullah as having no pr.ssoa woro indontical with tho fivo Indians montionod in tho first and socond paragraphs of this Momorandum. Nothing further has boon hoard of thorn by this Logation. Anothor dostituto Indian pilgrim, namod Ali Murad, mado statomonts to tho Indian Vico-Consul which throw light on tho Saudi Arabian G-ovornmont ! s troatmont of such porsons. idi Mur.d first talkod to Sayyid Lai Shah on tho Modina road in a coffoo houso whoro tho Indian Vico-Consul was strandod owing to a breakdown. Ali Murad and somo companions spoko to tho moro frooly bocauso thoy did not roaliso tho Indian Vico- Consul's official positiono They said that thoy had all followod tho Yomon routo and had managed to escape the vigilance of the Saudi guards on tho Yemen frontier. iu.i Murad himself had got a passage in a dhow from Mandvi (Cutch state) to Muscat, at a cost of ton rupees. After a series ^ adventures he and his companions arrived at Hodoida in the Yemen, ii-t a place named Hardh on the Saudi-Yemen frontier they mot a party of ovor fifty Takrunis who alarmed thorn by saying that thoy had boon arrested by Saudi frontier guards and sent back the way thoy camo after having boon soveroly flogged- So Ali Murad and his friends took care to go by dovious paths in tho mountains: with tho help of local Bedouin thoy managed to avoid all Saudi frontier posts and to reach Mecca on foot without further difficulty. Thoy had hoard a report that of a party of forty pilgrims who had rx.do the same journey last year thirtynino had died of thirst. Tho/^4- Tho atorios of Ibarr.tullah and Ali UUrr.d throw somo ligjrb on the two quostions (i) tho v/ay in which destituto pilgrims troat tho Saudi Arabian Grovommont aatboritiosj and (2) tho way in which tho Saudi Arabian G-ovornmont troat tho dostitutos. It is first of all advisablo to distinguish botwoon two difforont catogorios of destitutes 0 , first, pilgrims who havo onough money to buy a return ticket by' -toamerj, or who obtain one somehow, but who arrive at Jedda with very little or no money , so that they cannot pay mutawwif ? 3 dues s or oven buy food. Second, there are pilgrims like Ali Murad, who sxight be celled irate' pilgrims^ oney are simply indigent people who never obtain either passes or tickets in the ordinary way; they usually bog their way to somo convenient point on the Baluchistan coast, get taken across to Muscat or Mukalla or somo similar place by dhow 3 and walk to Mecca. Tho first category are usually detained by a mutawwif or vakil at Jedda5 and told that thoy will be sent back to India unless they can produce the proper foeso Somo of them manage to borrow the fees® Tho others' in actual fact seem to bo released to perform the pilgrimage at the very last moment* It seems to be the policy of the Saudi Arabia© G-overnment not to prevent any pilgrim of this category from performing the pilgrimage simply owing to lack of money« Some charitable person may eventually pay their fees? or in the last resort this Legation may succeed in persuading the Saudi auijhoritiQu to forego the fees altogether* The second category of pilgrims are sometimes caught and turned back at the Yemen frontier by guards specially appointed for that purpose* Some of them however manage to get through, and roach Mecca.. Once they get there they are apparently/apparently imprisbnocl or otiiorwisc placod undor survoillanco, but, in fact, manage to perform tho pilgrimagos thoh thoy arc got rid of in sorno way: from tho facts montionod abovo it sooma that thoy aro transportod to the Yomon frontier and lot go to make their way home as best thoy can &amp; just as they came. Some of them die on tho way • Tho Saudi atoitucuo to this so cone, class, thoroforo, is that tho frontier guards do their best to koop thorn out of tho country: but once they roach Mecca thoy arc allowed to do tho pilgrimage and disposed of afterwards. Some of them manage to get repatriated from Jodda at Government ex pense, by various tricks^ o»g» by giving false names and saying that. 1 thoy have lost their papers. The number of destitutes who had to be sent back to India at tho expense of the Government of India this year was approxi mately two hundredo Tho cost of suoh repatriation was, ov/ing to tho rate out ting policy pursued b3 r the two rival steamship companies, considerably less than it has been in recent years: it amounted to about two thoosand rupees^ idl the destitutes were without regular passes; thoy evidently belonged either to tho bocond category of pilgrim, or had lost their papers. They all declared that thoy had no money at all. From tho statements of lili Murad and others, however, the Indian ITice-Consul felt justified in adopting a sceptical attitude towards thoso claims, particularly as he had found that all such people traded on the well-known fact that genuine destitutes are sent back at the expense of tho Government of India, and that many boastou. of their intenuion to give this Legation false names and addresses so that it would be impossible to recover from them the cost of repatri ation. In the end most of the alleged destitutes produced some contribution towards the cost of thair passage; and even/I Qvon whon tiioy r-llogod 'thcit this took thoir lo.st fnx&amp;Jiihgt, it was found that thoy ^oro able to pay for transport by dhow bom shoro to ship. ^ Tho disposal of thoso indigont/lmposos a groat doal of work on tho PilgrioRgo staff at this Logation who al ready he-70 thoir timo fully occupiod r -&gt; ith tho urgent and oxacting routino work with ordinary pilgrims. It is thoroforo dosirablo to oxamino tho whole quostion of thoso dostitutos with a view to sooing whothor any action can bo taken with a viow to reducing thoir numbor. Tho following suggestions havo boon made and remain to bo examined. (l) Destitute pilgrims of the first catogory.i.o•pilgrims travelling by stoamer who havo enougji monoy to buy a roturn tickot but cannot pay the mutawwif's faoa. Theao could bo eliminated if all dock pilgrims wore required to make a deposit in cash before thoy loft thoir Indian port of embarkation: this deposit would bo onterod on their pilgrim pass and advances might bo made to any pilgrim by this Legation on the strength of the entry on tho pass. The Afghan Charge d'Affaires, who also finds the disposal of Afghan destitutes embarrassing problem, has suggested that the sum to bo ^deposited should be equivalent to the mutawwif duos which tho pilgrim will have to pay: thoy amount to approximately sixtythree rupees at present. (2) Is for the second category, the Grovornment of India may be willing to consider tho adoption of moasures calculated to prevent the departure of such indigent persons from Indian ports, particularly the ports between Karachi and tho joanian frontior. It might perhaps be possible to exorcise some control over the owners of dhows which ply between such Indian ports and ports on the Arabian peninsula., (3) A more effioiont control over pilgrims would bo obtained if each pilgrim had a photograph attached to his pass: this would prevent the sale of passes and onablo applicants/applicants to bQ idontifiod. (4) As an oxtonsion of tho proposal andor (l)&gt; it might bo possiblo to follo\7 tho carront practice of tho Egyptian authoritias. by including tho Saudi duos9 liko tho Ifciraaran quarantine dues undor Pilgrim Ships Rulo No. 128, in tho prico of tho ticket. The Egyptiah pilgrim has to doposit with tho Egyptiah authorities tho full amount v/hich ho will bo liciblo for during tho pilgrinngo, including* Saudi duos and cost of transport. He is gi^on a pilgrim pass (equipped with a photograph in ovory case, .for mon- a photograph is optional in tho caoo of v/omon) to vjhich is attached a coupon showing details of the amount deposited and tho means of transport by which the pilgrim intends to travel to the Hejaz. The w Ban que Misr 11 ' eventually adjusts all the Saudi claims; and the pilgrim has no cash payments to make in Saudi Arabia as far as transport or dues are ccncorned. •The advantages of such an arrangement may be. grouped under four heads. (a) From tho point of view of tho pilgrim. The ignorant pil grim, who is so often victimised by clover rogues, would pay his money in advance in one definite sumy Ho would no longer be liable to virtual imprisonment in some jfcidJ,lg. house in Jodda until he can produce the fees. He would no longer be liable to bo searched for his money. He would be protected against loss by exchanges for many pilgrims change their money at Jedda at ruinous, rates. The Vakils would have ivss control over him and would therefore be less able to extort money from him. (b) Prom the point of view of the Saudi authorities. The nakila themselves, deprived of a chanco of extortion, might not relish the change^ but the Saudi Oovernment, always solicitous for tho welfare of their visitors- would presumably welcome an arrangement which would secure more definitely the payment/payment thair clues. Yiflaat hr^poons at present is that the iirabian SaudLdiovernment collect two thijrds of the fees direct from the mutamif or wikil and leave the latter to Collect tile rest if he caa: both parties under the now arrahgoment woUld be in a bettor position- (c) From the jpoint of view of the Grovornment of India, v i ^ repatriation expenses v^hich in some years amount to a con- sidOrablo sum - in 1936 they were over thirty thousand rupees ^ would bo reduced. td) From the point of view of this Legation the work of the Pilgrimage section, which has always had to spend much time and energy in dealing with destitutes, would bo reduced. In conclusion it is to bo noticed ttet the Saudi autho rities appear to consider that the Egyptian system might with advantage be applied to Indian pilgrims. From rocoflt convoraation between the Indian ?ico-Consul and Haji Yusuf Zainal, the local ropresentativo of the Turner Morrison Lino f (a groat friond of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman the Minister of Finance) it appears that the Saudi authorities tako that view* Sayyid Lai Shah understands that the Saudi Arabian Gouernment at one timo thougjit of: appointing a representativo in Bombay and Karachi charged with the duty of investigating whether the pilgrims had paid their duos in advance or not.Copy of lottor No.1572/411/21 datod tho 17th July 1938, Iron the British Logption, Jidda, to tho 3ocrotary_ to tho Govormont of India in tho Bxtornal Affairs Dopartmont, Simla. ~ - j ■ »&lt; » In your dospatch No.F.94-N/56 of Jcme 20th. 1938 you drew ray attention to certain proposals raado by the Karachi and the Standing Haj Comaittoea last March concerning measures designed to reduce tho number of destitute pilgrims visiting the Hejaz. This despatch has crossed Sir RM.BullardJiB despatch to tho Viceroy Koi 1427/411/16-51; 'tho'^Oth iurio last on tho same subject, and no doubt His IJajosty's Minister's proposals will be examined by tho Governmont of India in con nexion with tho views of the Haj Committoea quoted above. It only remains for me to submit the following supplomentary observations arising out of tho spocific proposals made by tho Oomraittoos. 2. Tho proposal to insist on adoposit boing mado by tho pilgrim at tho timo ho purchasos his tickof at tho Indian port accords vdth tho suggostion in paragraph (1) on pago 6 of tho Momorandum onclosod with His Majesty^ IvIinistor ! s dospatch. Tho only difforonco is that Sir R.V/.Bullard rocommondod that tho doposit mdo at the Indian port should bo oquivalont to tho mutawif duos which mo pilgrim will havo to pay: and that tho doposit mado should bo onto rod on tho pilgrim pass, in order that this Legation might make advances to the pilgrim on the strength of the entry on tho pass, or alternatively pay over to tho Saudi Arabian Grovorn- mont direct the whole of tho mutawwif3 V feos=. I assume that the deposit would be in addition to a return ticket: i.e* that the pilgrims w ould havo to purchase a return ticket and also make the deposit. 3® The Banque Misr have an arrangement whereby an Sfeyptian/%7ptiaB pilgrim is obliged to deposit in cash tho whole of the Qstimated expenses of the pilgrim daring the Hajj, from the moment he leaves Egypt to the moment he returns to it# This arrangement was originally made, according to current report, in order to help the Banque Misr to recover some moneys which that bank had lent to the local government* Hcwever that may be it is a system which works, and which suits the Saudi Arabian Governments I have therefore no doubt in saying that the Haj Committee's proposal, or something on uhose lines9 would be welcomed by the local authorities. It would of course impose more work on the staff of this Legation. 4o In regard to the second paragraph of your am in entire agreement with the view that the proposals made by the Committee will not provide a complete solution of the difficult problems caused by destitute Indian pilgrims. It does not appear to me that any action taken here can solve the problem in any way® From the angle of this it appears that the chief difficulties are as follows: (a) Pilgrims who come by irregular routes seldom have passes at all: they get out of India in some irregular way and they beg their way to Mecca and back. Such pilgrims would not be affected in any way by the Committee f s proposals. The Gwernmant of India will no doubt consider whether a closer control can be imposed on dhows leaving the shores of Baluchi stan* .¥ q could of course refuse to have anything to do with pilgrims who had lost their passes: if the Government of India will agree to this most of the difficulties will be solved and most of the money now spent on repatriation f/ould be saved, as the vast majority of repatriated pilgrims have no passes: they usually explain that their passes have been stolen or hava been lost in some way, and it is impossible in this country to check such statements. I should be grateful to be informed in due course whether the Government of India desire/, &gt; y , , desire this Legation to abt 6n these line's: I febl bound to add however that the result wbdld probably that a large Bliiribei^ perhaps several hundredsi of destitute Indian • uould throng the streets of Jedda aldd vib'Uld cause great difficulty not only to this Ldgation bilt also to the Saudi Government. (b) Stowaways sometimes cause difficulties J this Lega tion has recently reported the arrival of twentyone persons by OcoSo M Snglestan' who did not hold pilgrim passes: such cases are rare&gt; and masters of ships are not likely to risk penalties by bringing such persons if they can avoid doing so*- (c) Single tickets are sometimes issued to pilgrims at an Indian port' such persons usually prove to have very little moneyo. to be unable to pay tiieir mutawwifs 1 dues.j and to apply for repatriation: I venture to surest that the Government of India should consider the advisability of making it an invaria^ ble rule that all pilgrims should be made to purchase return tickets at the port of embarkation. (d) There is another category of pilgrims who cause embarrassment to this Legation. They are pilgrims who stay on in this country affer performing the Hajj ? and who claim the refunds to which they are entitled in eighteen months on the grounds that they do not wish to returns and subsequently they declare themselves indigent and apply for repatriation. It seems of little use to say to such persons that they have no legal claim to repatriation: all that can be done here is to discourage such applications and treat each case on its merits•No. F.94-N/36, New Dolhi, The 5th Novombor 1938.

These proposals ^re: (i) that pilgrims travelling by the sea route should bo required to mako an additional doposit in cash to covor Mutawwif's fees and Saudi taxesj The doposit would bu entered on the pilgrim pass and advances could be made to pilgrims on the strength of the entry on the pass; (ii) that measures should be adopted to prevent tho departure of indigent persons from Indian ports, particularly the ports botween Karachi and the Iranian frontier, by the exercise of control over tho owners of dhows plying between Indian ports and ports on tho Arabian Peninsula, (iii) that pilgrims should bo required to affix their photographs on thoir passes to grovent the solo of pf-ssos and to enable applicants for repatriation to be identified; (iv) thai all pilgrims should bo required to purchase? return tickets at the port of embarkation; ana (v) that the British Legation, Jedda, should be allowed-2~ to discourage appliaations for refunds from pilgrims, v /ho are entitled to claim such refunds within 18 months if they do not wish to return to Indiabut who subsequently declare them selves indigent and apply for repatriation to India. 2* With regard to {i) s I am to state that the adoption of this proposal would necessitate an amendment of section 210 of the Indian Merchant Shipping Act, and such a- course is likely to be fraught with considerable difficulties. The Government of India do not consider therefore that the recovery of an aaditional deposit is at present feasible, but they are consul' ting the Standing Haj Committee in regard to the inclusion of a rule in the Indian Pilgrim Ships Rules^ 1933, empowering the pilgrim pass issuing authorities to refuse passes to persons who cannot satisfy them that' they have suffioiont means to meet the full ^Haj 1 expenses- 3, In regard to (ii), the G-overnment of India have had under consideration two methods for the control of country craft; (1) Statutorily, by amending the Indian Merchant Shipping Acto (2) Administratively5 by the exercise of official 'influenced The adaption of course (1) would necessitate the inclusion in the definition of 'unberthed passenger ship' under Section 149(2) of the Indian Merchant Shipping Act ? of country craft .parrying even less than 30 passengers, and the definition of 'Pilgrim ship' in section 149(4) would also require to be amended so as to include ships conveying piigrims from any port in British India to any of the other ports round about Muscat,, etc^ Furthermorej it would be necessary to prescribe the Minor Ports in Baluchistan as ports from which such ships may sail (vide section 150(1) of the Act)* Even if those legal requirements were satisfied, it would still be essential to set up administrative machinery to enforce the new regu^ lautions, and the provision of such machinery to control the numerous/■ / i y - numerous minor ports and nondescript.country craft would would V——-^ /foe expenditure of an annual sum mic h/am nunt to probably entail '.^Zmuch more than the present annual cost of repatriating destitute pilgrims. The G-overnment of India thereforefeel that the statutory remedy cannot be given effect to now. As regards (2), ikis method would consist in using the influence of the Political and State officials in Baluchistan in order to dissuade the owners of country craft from taking on pilgrims who are not in possession of passes® In this connection your attention is invited totho papers forwarded with Foreign 5 rnd Secretary^ letters Nos. 10-J,i5-lotted the 11th Iferch 1956, 15th April 1936, and 29th July 1936p respectively. The Muscat authorities, are also willing to cooperate in this matter through their representative fell) at Gwadur, which is the principal port in the Mekran coast from which,these country craft sail. It is considered that action is likely to prove effective to some extent* and the Government of India are of opinion that in view of the difficulties pointed out above they must rest content at present with action on these lines. 4. As regards (iii), attention is invited to the letter from the G-ovornment of .India, iu the Department of Education, Health c.nd Landsj Mo.F»l-56/38** , Haj, dated the 2nd December 1938* 5« As regards (iv) j the G-ovornment of India consider that the deposit and the return ticket system should exist side by side, \The taking of return tickets is becoming popular and no special action appears to be called for. 6. As regards (v), the position is that under section 208 0(2) of the India Merchant Shipping Agt, His Majesty^ Minister must, before sanctioning a refund, be satisfied that an appli-&gt; cant intends to remain in the Hojaz. If he is not satisfied, he may, of course, reject the application# I have the honour to be.

IS&amp;f . i' ■ British Residency and Consulate-General, BUSHIRB. Dated l^.t.. J.unA #.. .19S9.... Reference to previous correspondence : Description of Enclosure. Name and Date Despatch Ho.72 of April 19tii 1939, from Sir R.Bullard, British Legation, Jedda to the Foreign Office, together with enclosures. Subject. Pilgrim dues./I/O British Legation, e dda. April 19th», 1939. My Lord, I have the honour to transmit herewith copies of a letter received from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the Saudi Government 'have decided' that certain dues payable 'by pilgrims shall in future he collected by the shipping companies with the Saudi quarantine dues at the ports of departure, and also copies of a personal reply in which I have thought it well to give the Acting Minis ter for Foreign Affairs a warning of the difficulties in the way of the execution of this 'decision'. 2, The decision which the Saudi Government have adopted so hastily and expressed so curtly arises in the main out of the problem of the destitute pilgrim, who is unable to pay the dues demanded by the Saudi Government. Most of the destitutes, I regret to say, are Indians. Apart from those Indians who come by devious routes, walking most of the way, the last two seasons have seen a serious increase in the number of pilgrims who manage to secure a return ticket but arrive at Jedda with little or no money even for their own maintenance, let alone'for payment of the heavy dues, of which those mentioned in the Saudi letter, which do not include the koshan, are the smaller / part. The Right Honourable the Viscount Halifax, K,G., &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. No. 72 (897/1267/7)/ 4. n/ : part. The koshan? which is the fee for permission to go to Mecca, would prohahly have 'been included in the new Saudi scheme, had it heen uniform instead of varying according to the kind of transport used* 3* The Minister of Finance &lt;&gt; who is also in charge of the pilgrimage, made an arrangement some years ago with the Banque Misr, presumably with the consent of the Egyptian Government, under which Egyptian pilgrims pay in advance not only the cost of the return ticket to the Hejaz and the Hejaz quarantine fees, but also a sum. to cover the whole of their dues and maintenance during the pilgrimage. Even the koshan is included, being levied at the rate for motor transport4 The Minister of Finance suggested to the Indian Vice-Consul on more than one occasion that it would be a good thing to apply this system to Indian pilgrims. He was assured that the Government of India were well aware of the difficulties resulting from the participation in the pilgrimage of Indians who are unable to pay the dues, but at the same time he was advised that owing to the strength of religious feeling among Indian Moslems, and to legis lative difficulties, to deal with this problem was far from easy. It is regrettable that the Minister of Finance, who happens to be Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs for the moment, should have thought that he could dispose of the difficulty by issuing orders for action to be taken by foreign shipping agents in foreign ports, and I thought it well to give him a personal warning as to the difficulties that may be expected to occur.4. In order that pilgrims sailing from Sudan ports may not 'become destitute in the Hejaz the Sudan Government £Et:U5QQ take a depQsit of one and a half Egyptian pounds a head, and this can 'be drawn from the Legation in Jedda after the pilgrimage and used to pay Saudi dues as well as for maintenance. The Government of India however have informed me that to take a deposit in India for payment of Saudi dues would require legislation. 5,- The Saudi Government are trying to throw upon other governments a responsibility which is theirs 'but which they are afraid to face.' To stop the influx of destitutes it would suffice to prevent their performing the pilgrimage,, 'but this the Saudi authorities will not do. Pilgrims who on arrival cannot pay their dues are detailed in Jedda, 'but are released just in time for them to reach Mecca for the pilgrimage, though they are also detained after the pilgrimage, sometimes for weeks, in an attempt to extract at least part of the sum due either from the'pilgrims themselves or from richer pilgrims who may care to redeem them. So long as this practice continues, destitutes will continue to arrive in the country. It may he in part religious scruples which underlie the Saudi Government's attitude: it may go against their conscience to prevent a Moslem already in the Hejaz from making the pilgrimage; 'but I believe that the main motive is fear of criticism in other Moslem countries. The Saudi Government must 'be well aware that the heavy charges they make for everything connected with the pilgrimage are unpopular. A critic in an Indian vernacular paper has recently given these figures of the / cost/yj cost of the pilgrimage: Rupees In the time of the Turks 4-5 Hussein 10 it Ihn Saud; at the beginning 19 now 67 I cannot guarantee the accuracy of the earlier figures? 'but there has certainly 'been an enormous increase even in the course of Ihn Saud's regime; and if the Saudi authorities 'began to compel foreign pilgrims to return to their own countries without having made the pilgrimage? merely for non-payment of dues? there would be an outcry in which political and religious prejudices would have full play- The Saudi Government apparently hope to attain their object without incurring such criticism? by compelling the shipping companies to collect some of the Saudi dues with the ticket money and the quarantine dues. With an ignorant public such as the mixed crowds of African pilgrims who come from and via the Sudan? the adoption of this policy might cause no remark? but in India? even if the procedure could be adopted without legislation? violent criticism mast be aroused? and the Saudi Govern ment would come in for their share of it.' My Netherlands colleague assures me that the proposed procedure would arouse great hostility among Moslems in the East Indies also • 6. I have talked the matter over with those of my colleagues who represent states under whose flag pilgrims travel by sea to the Hejaz.- The French Minister? who / knows t//^T\ knows North Africa well, says that it would T dc impossilDle to apply the proposed procedure to French pilgrims from Algiers and Tunis and he has written to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs explaining the difficulties. The Nether- lands 4Javane-se-) Vice-Consul who is at present in charge of the Legation has taken no action., in the absence of his chief, 'but is confident that his Government will oppose the Saudi suggestion. My Italian colleague shakes his head over the question of jurisdiction, but in that the Italian Government not only suppress public opinion but provide the shipping and the foreign exchange for their pilgrims, the adoption of the procedure would present no difficulty, and I should expect them to fall in with the Saudi proposal as a means of currying favour in this country. 7. The ports concerned for which we are responsi ble are those in India, Malaya and the Sudan. There is also the question of Palestinians, who usually travel with the Egyptian pilgrims but have not hitherto paid the Saudi dues in advance^ I assume that each of the Governments concerned will inform me in due course of the attitude which it proposes to adopt. 8, I am sending copies of this despatch and of its enclosures to the Honourable the Minister of External Affairs, Union of South Africa, (906/1267/7), the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department (898/1267/7), His Majesty's Ambassador at Cairo (No.902/1267/7), His Excellency the Governor- General of the Sudan (No. 900/1267/7), His Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine (No.905/1267/7) , / TheirTheir Excellencies the Governors of the Straits Settlements (No.899/1267/7), Nigeria (No.904/1267/7), Soraaliland (No.905/1267/7) ?

This Ministry take this opportunity of expressing their highest respects.. (sealed) Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mecca.No.851/1267/5. British Legation, FerBonal . Jedda. April 15th., 1939. Dear Shaikh Abdullah, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the circular from the Ministry of Foreign Affaire No. 153/15/18 of April 4th. about the collection of certain Saudi pilgrim dues ftom foreign pilgrims at the ports of departure, and I wish to place before you privately certain considerations which it is necessary to take into account in the case of steamship lines bringing pilgrims from British ports. 8. According to the Information which I possess at present, special legislation would have to be passed in India before the steamship agents could collect Saudi dues from pilgrims embarking from Indian ports, and it may be that the position is the same in other British territories from which pilgrims come to the Hejaz. The fact that not all the pilgrims are British subjects who travel from British ports on British steamers might be an additional complication* However# of course I shell/transmit the suggestion of the Saudi Government to rry Government and to the governments of all the British territories concemed, and will inform you of the result officially in due course# 3* I would suggest that the quarantine dues do / not His excellency Shaikh Abdullah Sulaiman, ^ecca*not furnish an exact analogy in this matter. The quaran tines dues are a matter of international concern and I 'believe that it is for that reason and on a 'basis of reciprocity that their collection in British ports of departure is permitted^ whereas the pilgrim dues which it is now desired to collect in foreign ports are a matter of purely internal concern. 4« There is one further point which I would like to mention privately to Your Excellency. In paragraph 1 K it ie stated that the total fee to 'be collected from all pilgrims other than those from the East Indies and British Malaya ie two pounds gold and eighty two and a half piastres gold. Hitherto it has 'been customary to collect only half the usual dues from all West African and Sudanese pilgrims who, as Your Excellency will 'be aware# ere generally very poor. This season# for instance / ' the fee collected from them was two Egyptian pounds, two hundred and fifty milliemee. I trust that it is not the intention of the Saudi A r abian Government to endeavour to collect the full fee from these poor pilgrims who have always hitherto 'benefited 'by the generosity of the Saudi Arabian Government. Yours sincerely# H. W.

Muscat!, Bahraini and Kuwaiti Pilgrimages French Somaliland and North AfricaThe extension of the war during 1941 to South-East Europe and Russia was offset 9 so far as the pilgrimage was concerned ? by the collapse of Italian power in East Africa which made the Red Sea safe for maritime traffic. pilgrims from India, therefore, in spite of the rapidly growing menace of war in the Far East, travelled to Jedda in surprisingly large numbers. It was at first estimated that a maximum of 7,500 persons would require shipping accommodation, 'but, in the event, no less than 10,712 Indians made the journey and extra shipping had to be made available at short notice# From Egypt 3,6l3 pilgrims came to the Hejaz, encouraged to do so, no doubt, by British successes in Lybia during November. The threat of war in the Far East kept Malays and Javan ese at homer Persian pilgrims were seen again this year in the Hejaz after an interval of many years, the ban on the Persian pilgrimage to Mecca having been lifted after the abdication of Reza Shah Pehlvio Disturbed conditions in Persia, however, coupled with lack of transport, kept the number low« They travelled overland by the Nejaf-Medina road in old and inefficient vehicles provided by an Iraqi company and they suffered much hardship en route from their cars constantly breaking down in the desert. Indeed, if it had not been for the action taken by Ibn Saud, who sent all his available motor transport to the rescue? the majority of them would not have reached Mecca in time. As it was, two hundred were too late, to perform the Haj. A Persian Vice Consul came from Cairo to keep an eye on his compatriotse A number of Iraqi pilgrims, also, travelled overland in transport furnished by the same company and with the same results* The Saudi and Iraqi Governments are, it is be lieved, still squabbling as to who should pay the expenses of the rescue party sent by 7Lbn Saudo The Italian defeat in East Africa cleared the way for thousands of Sudanese and West Africans of whom over 8,000 visited the Hejaz* The Axis powers were not represented at the pilgrimage this year except for some Moslem' ratings from the crews of Italian warships interned in Jedda who were allowed to go to Mecca as an act of grace.

For the first time since his conquest of the Hejaz His Majesty King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud did not come on pilgrim age. This decision was dictated by the need for economy. His Royal Highness the Amir Peisal 9 Viceroy of the Hejaz pre sided in his father's stead at all the functions. The following prominent persons from abroad attended the pilgrimage;- M. Hasrat Mohani.

Jedda* The Saudi Arabian quarantine staff were the same as last year. No cases of small -pox .or other infectious disease were notified^ 4 HEALTH, The Saudi Arabian Public Health Department declared the pilgrimage clean. The Indian Medical Officer neither noticed nor heard of any case of infectious disease at Mecca or Muna during the pilgrimage days. As usual, most of ths Indian pilgrims_were old and infirm. Diarrhoea and other troubles of the digestive system were more prevalent than last year. In some cases Diarrhoea was so severe as to cause alarming symptoms. Malaria, pneumonia, bronchitis and other chest troubles and dysentery were common, as usual. A few pilgrims contracted small-pox while waiting^ for steamers in Jedda* They were admitted to the local hospit al and the Tndian Medical Officer detained them, after dis charge from the hospital, until it was certain they were free from infection. All of them were Bengalis and it is evident they had not been properly protected. The Public Health Officers concerned should, it is suggested, be more careful regarding vaccination and vaccination certificates. One case of chicken-pox and three cases of measles were noticed among the pilgrims during the return journey to India.

Jedda, The Jedda dispensary was open to the public throughout the year except for a period of two weeks during the pilgrim age when all the medical staff went to Mecca as usual'- The unusually prolonged stay made by pilgrims awaiting steamers in Jedda resulted in much more work than usual for the dispensary and the expenditure of medicines was so great as to necessitate an emergency indent for fresh medical supplies being sent to India. The daily attendance at the dispensary remained high even after the departure of the pilgrims* This was due to the closing of the Italian dispensary and to the lack of medi cines in all other local dispensaries and hospitalso Some three thousand Nigerians and Sudanese were vaccinated during February and March by a doctor sent from the Sudan. He worked in conjunction with the Indian Medical Officer. Mec ca. No sub-Assistant Surgeon and no extra dispenser were sent from India this year. Doctor Ghulam Rasul was, however, assisted by Doctor Ghulam Hussain who had come from India to succeed him as Indian Medical Officer, and one of the Jedda dispensers worked with Doctor Ghulam Hussain at the Mecca dis pensary. The dispensary functioned from December 11th., 1941, to January 26th., 1942« Arrangements at Muna and Arafat were the same as usual.

Jedda on February 19th., 19^2, relieving Doctor Mirza Ghulam Rasul who sailed for India the same day. 5 - INTERNAL TEANSPORT* • ' ::: . The Arab Motor Transport Company still lingers on. Hundreds of old vehicles which had been disoarded as unservice able were reconditioned and brought into use to meet the un expected demand which rose to three times that of the previous year. The Company thus made good profits without- incurring much expenditure. The completion of the Jedda-Mecca road before ; the pilgrim age season simplified the journey from the main pilgrim port to the Holy City. But breakdowns in old and ill equipped vehicles on the Medina track were frequent and at times caused real hard ships to pilgrims* The Company could not be blamed as they, like every one else, had not anticipated so large : a pilgrimage and they were unrble to import new vehicles^ It is' the opinion of the Indian Vice-consul that really serious-■troubles-will arise during the first pilgrimage after the war, Th^n the Company will find itself without any vehicles in good repair? while there will, no doubt, be a bumper pilgrimage season and a very great demand, for motor -transport. . ; : ■'-■■■ ■■■'-'■ - .

The Mutawwif only returns to the Hejaz by the last ship, but his victims who have gone ahead of him frequently find that the agents in Jedda refuse to honour their principals' promise. There were innumerable cases of this kind this year and the Indian Vice-Consul was oe- seiged by pilgrims wishing to regain their money. The ca s® ox Mutawwif Seraj Abdul Majid was particularly heinous as he obtained loans from no less than eleven Assam pilgrims knowing that such pilgrims came under the Taqrir system and th&amp;t' they could m no circumstances select him as their 'lutawwif. The Indian Vice-Consul by the exercise of a mixture and firmness was able to obtain satisfaction for all or most ot the pilgrims in question. proper publicity m India advising pilgrims to refrain from giving loans to Mutawwifs would put an end to these malpractices. The Taarir system continues to ooerate in spite of ics un popular it y 'b5th with pilgrims and with Mutawwifs who do not enooy the monopoly. In reply to an enquiry from the Legation the Saudi A?abian Government stated that the provinces of Madras and Assam with their dependencies,- except the district of Sylh .t in Aspam, are held by a particular Mutawwif or xamily of hut^wwifo as a personal hereditary benefice; this means Jjau p-Ur-ms coining from those regions have no cnoice in selecting Muuaww f^. They are automatically grabbed by the holder of bhe monopoly. Memone as a community also suffer from this abnoxious system. A moroni ov holder is sure of his flock 01 pilgrims without any ex °rtlons'by himself. He is thus not concerned wiun the welfare of pilgrims under his charge. A typical case , when four Behar pilgrims complained against Sayyid Ahmed oh.ikh, whose son had declined to refund several sums of money th«.t had T-, ei=r , to him. Sayyid Ahmed, v/hen confronted by the Indian' Vice-Oonsul - admitted one of the claims but refunded only - ror-tio'n of 'it. The other claims he declined to adm„t.

After allowing twenty-five pe cent reduction the total cost in riyals for 1st, Grade pilgrims came to Rupees 1165, for the 2nd, Grade Rupees 749 and for the 3rd., Grade Rupees 425, The Saudi Arabian Government directed the agents of the^ Mogul Line to collect boat hire of three rupees per pilgrim in advance when collecting the cost of the steamer tickets. As hy this measure the Saudi Arabian Government were requiring a Rriti^h firm to collect Saudi Arabian taxes in India, th. qu^ction was taken up hy HisVlesty• s Minister with the Saudi Ministry of Finance who agreed that the Jedda agents of ohe shipping companies should collect the boat hire on board the pilgrim ships in Jedda harbour before the pilgrims land. The Government of India, however, to the surprise of the Legation, decided that, as a temporary measure during this pilgrimage season, boat h.i. should be collected by the shipping 0 _ tickets as the Saudi Arabian Government wiohed. Ao du- pub- c itv was given 'by the Government of India about this collection of dues in advance, no serious complaint of extortion came to the notice of the Indian Section. The last two pilgrim ships, ''Rahmani' and 'Alavi' did noc call at Kamaran so that the Kamaran Quarantine P^ a T ^ p advance by pilgrims, were refunded in Jedda by the Mogul Lint^ agents unon the instructions of ohe Government 01 ™- Xndi&amp;n Vioe-Gonsul superintended the repayment of Rupees 3 to each pilgrim travelling on the two ships in que so ion. 9 INDIAN P ILGRIMAGE * The pilgrimage season opened with the arrival of s/s 'Rahmani' on November 25th, ? 1941 ? which brought to Jedda one thousand four hundred and eighty-seven pilgrims. The following table shows the number of British subjects from each province (including Burma and Ceylon) who embarked from Indian ports. These figures are based on the returns of the Port Haj Committees. Thirteen pilgrims died en route to Jedda. The total number of Indian pilgrims shown n-r Phant^r 2 differs from the total shown below. The aiii^i^nc^ ?s explained by the fact that the former was compiled from Saudi returns which are never very accurate.For the third year in aucoseslon the Scindhia Line did not participate in the pilgriraage traffic. The Mogul Line employ all their ships except s's 'Islami'.

Ts-nan's e ntry into the war mads pilgrims nervous about their re turn^Journey and they flocked to Jedda ^l fl ^e namhers before there were sufficient ships to cope wxth th.m. At on. time tn.r were no less than four thousand waiting in Jedda. Pilfrims' nervousness was increased by the propaganda of local Axis agents who put it about that Britain was no longer of rcrotecting her merchant ships and suggesting that pil- grims would have to wait in Jedda until the end of the war. Thi i&lt;=d to a mild panic and pilgrims on several occasions s: : ~=ss~^m=s2:|. g n £S,g .p'°S. to ». mass or Jllgrl..with their leaders, he succeeded in calming them down and in counteracting the efforts of enemy propaganda# The arrival and departure of s/s 'Rizwani' and s/s 'Akbar' with full loads of pilgrims in the middle of February finally convinced pilgrims that they had nothing to fear. The situation was further eased when the Indian Vice-consul prevailed upon the Saudi Arabian authorities to allow pilgrims to return to Mecca at cheap rates to await in the Holy City the arrival of further ships# ' Hajjis always prefer Mecca to Jedda as the conditions of life are much better there. After waiting for fifteen days for ships, pilgrims became entitled to the usual subsistence allowance of one rupee a day and the large sum of over rupees fifty-three thousand was paid out by the Legation in this respect this year. As the blame for the delays could not be attributed to the shipping company, this expenditure was charged to the Government of India. Urged by their anxiety to return home at the first opportunity, several pilgrims unscrupulously tried, to evade the operation of the rotation system by bribing the Mutawwifs 1 agents to get their passages booked in advance before leaving Mecca. The Indian Vice-Consul detected three such attempts to deceive made by batches of pilgrims* The attempts were punished by detain ing those responsible for some time in Jedda and at the same time the Mutawwifs 1 agents were made to pay fines ranging from Rupees twenty to Rupees eighty, the proceeds of the fines being spent in assisting poor pilgrims. The Indian Vice-Gonsul, while in Medina in April, 1942 examined the question of the return of pilgrims from Medina in the ho-oe of synchronising the arrival of pilgrims in Jedda with the ship'oinj s'oace available from time to time# Unfortunatel: r under the oresent Saudi transport arrangements no help can be expected from the Saudi Arabian Government. The track to Medin is bad and it causes much wear and tear to vehicles. The transport conroany has either to detain their vehicles indefinite ly at'Medina till pilgrims are required to return, or send them back empty to Mecca, and then again despatch them to Medina when it' is time for Indian pilgrims to leave for Jedda, with the result that either the company has to suffer financially or pilgrims muet pay more* The solution would be to provide ships in time to repatriate pilgrims from Jedda as soon as they collsc there, a solution which is practically impossible at present. This year, unfortunately the engine break-down of s/s 'Khosrou' added to the delays experienced in the repatriation arrangements of Indian pilgrims# The distribution of over fifty-three thousand rlyaie amongst four thousand pilgrims, the majority of whom had to be paid several times, entailed much laborious work on the part or th?f already over—worked Indian Section# Thousands of payments had to be made every day, and proper receipts obtained, g ood, Ac commodatio n t etci_ There were very few complaints about the catering arrange ment of the Kogul Line* However, the flour used for chapatia /waswas reported to 'be very fine, and its use 'by pilgrims is stated to have resulted in indigestion and dysentery. On the recom mendation of the Indian Medical Officer the Legation addressed the port Ha3 Committee, Bombay, on the subject, suggesting that coarse flour be supplied to eliminate these troubles. The Port Haj Committee have, however, refused to agree. Pilgrims were encouraged at the ports of embarkation to store their heavy luggage in the holds of pilgrim ships. But on the arrival of s/s 'Rahmani, the first pilgrim ship, many pilgrims complained to the Indian Vice-Consul about the loss of their luggage which they had thus stored. It was noticed that the loss was due to stored luggage not being handed over to the pilgrims before their disembarkation. Instead, the local ship ping agents removed the stored luggage from the holds and dumped it at the quay. This caused confusion. The Legation therefore suggested that all heavy luggage should be handed over to the owners a few hours before reaching Jedda. This was put into effect and there were no more complaints. Steamships 'Alavi', 'Rizwani' and 'Akbar' were authorised by the Legation to carry seventeen, eighty-seven and twenty-five pilgrims respectively in excess of their normal complement on their return voyages. This was done at the request of the pil grims themselves. On her second voyage s/s 'Rahmani' arrived here with only one medical officer though she had a carrying capacity of over one thousand pilgrims. The Legation therefore authorised the Master to carry one thousand four hundred and sixty-six pilgrims, irrespective of the provisions of Section 201 of the Indian Merchant Shipping Act of ±923 under which a second doctor was necessary if the number exceeded one thousand pilgrims. T^is was done in the interest of Indian pilgrims and the Govern ment of India. The Indian Vice-Consul observed that the Saudi Arabian Gover nment was once again permitting its subjects connected with pil grimage work to visit Indian pilgrim ships on the days of embark ation of pilgrims. The Legation approached the Qaimmaqam of Jedda on the subject with a request that, as in the past, no Mutawwifs, or their wakils or sabees should be allowed to board Indian pilgrim ships on the days when pilgrims were embarking. The Qaimmaqam issued the necessary instructions to the author ities concerned, and the malpractice of reserving space for fav ourite pilgrims was thus stopped. The Legation issued one hundred and twelve Emergency Certi ficates to pilgrims who had lost their original pilgrim passes, and one hundred and thirty-two to those who stated that they came by overland route without travel document 9 or had lost their passes during their long stay in the Hejaz, Ten thousand one hundred and eighteen pilgrims registered themselves at the Indian Section of the Legation out of a total number of ten thousand four hundred and forty-four Indian pilgrims. Thirty- three unclaimed and unused return tickets are still held at the Legation from the previous year. These will be forwarded in due course to the Port Haj Committee, Bombay. Only four Indians reported the loss of their return tickets and the agentsof the Mogul Line were informed in time to prevent their use by unauthorised persons. The pilgrims concerned sailed on duplicate tickets issued by the agents on the authority of the Legation* Once again the Hyderabad State Caravan did not come to the Ha&gt; The old Kafila Salar 9 Sayyid Qadar Mohiyuddin, came to the Hejaz, with a sum of ten thousand rupees that had been entrusted to him by authorities in Hyderabad for distribution amongst the poor in the Hejaz. Destitutes* A total of one hundred and thirty-two destitute^Indian pilgrims were repatriated by the Legation in steamships? 'Khosrou'S '•^iZY/ani', 'Jehangir' and 'Akbar' 5 on January S9th* February 19th. March 18th. and April 9th. ? 1942. The repat riation cost the Government of India seven thousand three hun dred and twenty-six rupees, and one hundred and ninety and a half Saudi riyals# The tables given below have been prepared from the records kept at the Legation. It is clear from these tables that, as last year, half of these destitutes hail from Bengal and. Assam. Sind comes second. Out of these, twenty-one admitted that they had drawn refunds payable on their return tickets, and spent the money. In the course of interrogations the indi Vice-Consul discovered that five of the destitutes had said in their statement that they had come to the He jaz by the overland route 3 while in fact they had travelled by sea and had obtained refunds on their return tickets* (a) g rovinv e s of Origi n* Bengal Assam Bombay United Provinces Madras North Y/est Frontier Sind Punjab Baluchistan Behar Hyderabad State (Deccan) Central India Agency 46 17 7 5 2 6 21 16 1 2 8 1 132 (b) Route of access.

Once again this year the Port Haj Committee at Bombay does not ap'oear to have published the usual Manual of Instructions for pilgrims* The Government of Indiajhowever, accepted the proposals of the Indian Vice-Consul to summarise the most important points that every pilgrim should know. As a result the majority of the pilgrims were aware of the Saudi tariff and no cases of over charging were reported. Very few pilgrims brought bags of food stuffs with them. It is regretted that some pilgrims still continue to advance or lend money to Mutawwifs or their sabees. Bank ins: Facilitis s ._ Seven thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine rupees were deposited by Indian pilgrims with the Legation for safe custody. Indian Section. Mr. Abdur Rahim Khan, second pilgrimage clerk, after three years P'ood work? was relieved by Mr. Ali Gowhar from the North- Vest Frontier Civil Secretariat, Mr. Gowhar has rapidly famil iarised himself with the work, and has made himself very useful. Munshi Qazi was once again employed as a temporary clerk and his experience in the office, of the shipping company has been found very useful. The Indian Vice-Consul? at the close of his five years' deputation period, expresses his special gratitude to Mr. Shah Jehan Kabir, his first assistant, whose experience ot ohe pface and great knowledge of pilgrimage work has been extremely valuable. Mr. Hhah Jehan Kabir's work during his many years service in Jedda has been excellent. 10 AFGHAN PILGRB'IAGE . Table A in Chapter 2 shows only two Afghan pilgrims as havins arrived by sea to perform the HaAs last year, these^ figures are absolutely misleading. The number of Afgnan pilgrims was not less than two hundred, but they travelled as British Indians on Indian pilgrim passes as the Afg-ian Government has declined to permit their subjects undertake the journey to the Hejaz during the war. 1. jm11 PALESTINE AHD TRANSJORDAN PILGRIMAGES. No mention is made of pilgrims from Palestine and Trans- Jordan in the returns published this year by the Saudi Quarantine authorities and the figures relating to them are probably in cluded in the total of four thousand five hundred and sixteen under the heading 'Egypt'. (See Statictics: Table ''B'). But according to the Government of Palestine Department or Healtn nine hundred and twenty-five persons had registered by December 10th.j 1941, as intending pilgrims; an increase of five hundred and forty on the previous year's total of three hundred and eighty-five. No figures are available regarding those who travelled overland. Shipping facilities were totally inadequate and caused much trouble and anxiety to pilgrims and officials alike, both before and after the pilgrimage. Two small Khedivial Mail Line st^am srs which were called upon to transport nearly four thousand souls from Suez to Jedda in addition to some three thousand from the Sudan in the relatively short period of five weeks preceding the pilgrimage, failed to accomplish the task. Following representations from the Government of Palestine Hio Majesty's Minister prevailed upon Messrs. Turner, Morrison &amp; Co. of Bombay, to place the s/s 'Rizwani 1 , which was en route to Suez! at the disposal of some six hundred Palestinian, Transjor- denian and Egyptian pilgrims who would otherwise have missed the pilgrimage. During the return season the position was much more' serious. Egyptian pilgrims were, as usual, giv„n pi 101 ity passages and travelled at considerably reduced rates. This double form of discrimination was greatly resented oy the large numb^i s of Palestinians who had to wait in Jedda under the most trying conditions and in reduced circumstances for nearly a month. During the return season three hundred and eighty pilgrims were refunded the total sum of £•! f50# 0. 1.2 SUDAMBSE PILOEIMAGH. According to Saudi Quarantine returns, ? ne hundred and ninety-six Sudanese pilgrims arrived at Jedda from the Sudan, as compared with one hundred and fifty-six in th. pr.- vious year. Shipping facilities were totally inadequate. , five weeks preceding the pilgrimage ohe two small Kh-aivial Mail Tin° steamers were wholly engaged in transporting pilgrims fiom Sevpt and it was fortunate that ships of the Mogul Line were^ eve liable for the transport of pilgrims from the Sudan. Duiing th'''return season the position became critical, and much distress and suffering was caused to hundreds of indigent Sudanese and Nigerians who had to wait several weeks for a steamer. During the return season eight hundred and ninety-six pilgrims were refunded the total sum of £E. 1,339.500mm. A 313 \?E3T APRICAM PILGRIMAGE. Saudi Quarantine return show that seven thousand and forty- eight '7est African pilgrims of all nationalities arrived for the pilgrimage from the Sudan via Jedda, as compared with one thousand eight hundred and eighteen in the previous year. During the return season a total sura of £E.64»640rara was refunded to sixty-four pilgrims who travelled under the aus pices of the Nigerian Pilgrimage Control Scheme# 14 SOMALI PTLGRIMAGB. According to Saudi Quarantine returns seventy-tv/o Somali and Sritreans arrived at Jedda for the pilgrimage# Of that number at least thirty-nine were Somalis who travelled on paid- up pilgrim passes. During the return season thirty-eight pilgrims were refunded the total sum of two thousand nine hundred and twenty-five rupees, 15 PILGRIMAGE OP INHABITANTS OF THE OOLONY AND PROTECTOR- AT E OF ADE N According to Saudi Quarantine returns one hundred and seventy-two Hadhrami and Adenese arrived at Jedda for pilgrim age, as compared with forty-one in the previous year. No figur es are available regarding those who travelled overland via Yemen and Asir. Treaty Chiefs of the Aden Protectorate who performed the pilgrimage were Sultan Abdulla bin Uthman A1 Fadhli, who was accompanied by his son and eight followers; Sheikh Qasin Abdur rahman A1 Maflahi and Sheikh Saleh bin Sayed A1 Alawi.

But risk to life of pilgrims must be main consideration and on information available we are reluctantly compelled to ? decide that no Haj sailings may be permitted. We are taking Moslem -*• Leaders and Committee into confidence- Thereafter we shall issue press communique on subject.

The concourse on the famous hill of Arafat was estimated in the region of 100,000 persons of whom about a quarter had travelled hy sea.

The King of Egypt was therein given the title of u Mutawwakil 'Ala Allah M (he who relies^upon God) which is a title once used 'by the Abhasid Caliphs# Ihn Saud surprisingly does not appear to have objected. 8* The Iraqi and Persian pilgrims, who travelled overland ^P er '' ienced much difficulty and hardship arising from insufficient ad inefficient motor transport.

The Saudi Arabian Government did not maintain a quarantine station at Al-Arid for Iraqi pilgrims coming overland this year# Kamaran . Steamships coming from India were not required to call at 'Kamaran as no pilgrims came from India by sea. Suakin. The arrangements were on the same lines as before. A Sudani woman succeeded in embarking her child suffering from small-pox, concealed in a basket, during the return Journey to Suakin and as a result of it, all the pilgrims carried by that ship had to be detained in quarantine there for fourteen days* which caused delay in clearing Sudanese and Nigerian pilgrims from Jedda. Jedda. No cases of small-pox or any other infections diseases were notified. General arrangements were the same as last year, Dr, Yehia Nasri, director of quarantine was promoted to be Director General of Public Health, in November 1948, and the vacancy thus caused was filled by his assistant Dr. Iszat Faraon# (^) health . The Saudi Arabian Public Health Department declared the Haj clean and the Indian Medical Officer confirmed this. Malaria, diarrhoea, dysentry, bronchitis and other chest complications were common amongst the pilgrims as usual. Niger ians, Sudanese, Yemenese and some other pilgrims contracted small pox during their stay in Hejaz after the Haj, although they were supposed to have been vaccinated before leaving their countries. Saudi Medical Service. Dr. Mahmud Hamdi Hamuda, the Director General of Fublic Health for some years past, has died and Dr. Yehia Nasri has been appointed to succeed him. The new Director General appears to be an energetic man and is reported to be re-organizing the Saudi Medical Services.

The Indian Medical Officer, keeping in view the poor financial condition of the country, made free visits to deserving patient# at their residence liberally. o ther Foreign Medical Assistance*. The general medical arrangements of J® nd8 t ^p-ations were the same as last year. The Medical Officer of the Netherlands Legation left the Hejaz in February, on a special mission, and his dispensary has been closed since then. The Igyptian legation has ohtainea the permission of the Saudi Arabian Government to maintain eight beds for in palready existing buildings of their out-door dispensary at Medina. This was a necessity and will prove very useful both for the general public and pilgrims. Unlike previous years the Iraqi pilgrims were not accompanied by a doctor. Most of them requiring attention attended the Indian dispensaries. Dr. Mahmud Hamad Nasir was sent by the Sudan Government to look after Sudanese and Nigerian pilgrims# He treated over 1^300 patients of different diseases and vaccinated about 4^000 pilgrims in Jedda before embarkation. He worked in conjunction with the Indian Medical Officer, and showed great zeal and enthusiasm in rendering medical aid to pilgrims he was responsible for* Legation Medical Staff.

The absence of Indian pilgrims caused the Indian Mutawwifs much pecuniary loss. This may have a salutary effect in future# There is nothing further to report in this connection. (8) PILGRIMAGE TARIFF * There is little to report under this heading. The tariff was the same as in 1941, and, as in that year the Saudi Arabian Government granted a reduction of 25^ on all charges, 'poor pilgrims ,, enjoyed the usual remission of Government dues and taxes. (9) INDIAN PILGRIMAGE . There was no official Indian pilgrimage in 1942. Nevertheless there was in the country a residue of pilgrims from previous years, some of them destitute, and a few Indians did reach the Hejaz travel ling by land via Nejaf and Medina or from the Persian Gulf. Some Indians also came from Sast Africa and from Egypt. Return ticket holders from previous years returned to India on February 19th. , on board s/s 'Akbar'. They had previously been instructed by the Legation at the request of the Company to come to Jedda for the departure of s/s 'Jehangir' on January 22nd. , but at the last minute the master of this vessel refused to embark them as he claimed his ship was not authorized to carry them# This caused great hardship and much natural indignation among the pilgrims and necessitated the payment of subsistence allowance to them while waiting in Jedda to the total of Riyals 5,839. S/B 'Akbar', in addition to return ticket holders, embarked 11? destitute Indians, and the remaining destitutes (6 in were embarked in the same ship on her next voyage on April 12th. The cost of repatriating these destitutes was in the region of Rupees 7,000. The tables given below have been compiled from records kept by tne Legation. They show that the majority of these destitutes hail from Sind, with Bengal taking second place. Thirty-nine of the de stitutes admitted that they had drawn the refunds payable on their return tickets and had spent the money so obtained. Several 'Sabees who were originally Indians but have adopted Saudi nationality for the purpose of the pilgrimage traffic, found that they were unable to obtain permission to travel to India and endeavoured to pass themselves off as destitutes. The fraud was discovered and they were not allowed to embark. /(a) provinces of origin.and tact have been of the highest benefit to pilgrims and his pleasing personality and charm of manner have been greatly appre ciated by all members of the British Legation at Jedda. (10) AFGHAN PILGRIMAGB* Table A in Chapter 2 shows that six Afghan pilgrims arrived by sea to perform the Haj. Mohammad Sadiq Mojaddedi, the Afghan Minister in Cairo, who also represents his Governmsnt at the court of the King of Saudi Arabia, came by the last pilgrim boat from Suez, and returned to Cairo after the Ha^j# He was accompanied by his son* As usual, he did not bother himself about Afghan pilgrims^ and spent most of his time in visiting the King, royal princes and diplomats^.;- of other nationals® (11) PALESTINIAN AND TRANSJQRDAK PILGRIMAGBB . Saudi quarantine returns show that 3,167 Palestinian and Transjordan pilgrims arrived at Jedda by sea for pilgrimage this year As usual these pilgrims were the victims of the system whereby they have to travel in ships of the Khedivial Mail Line# This pany, apart from being generally inefficient and cheese-paring= variably gives priority to Egyptian pilgrims and transports thein preferential rates# Palestinian and other non*»Bgyptian pilgi^T therefore saw ship-load after ship-load of Egyptians sailing ^Y a - from Jedda while they had to wait, in circumstances of great dis comfort, until it pleased the Company to transport thei*. A full report on this subject has been sent to the High Co ioner for Palestine and an alternative scheme has been submitteo. him whereby Palestine (and Syrian) pilgrims should use Aqaba as u : l ■Dort of arrival and departure and should utilize British- ships wn unlike vessels of the Khedivial Mail Line, would be under British control# A larger number of pilgrims than usual travelled overland this year, arriving at Jedda in a pitiable condition shortly before tne ■pilgrimage. On arrival at Jedda 93 of these pilgrims petitioned His Majesty* s Charge d'Affaires for immediate financial assistance and early repatriation# In the interests of all concerned,and particularly those of the pilgrims themselves, the use of the overland route, when the alternative sea route is open, cannot be too strongly conaemnea# During the return season 1248 pilgrims were refunded the total sum of £.E e 4,992.790m/ms. (12) sodae pil'&gt; rimagb* According to Saudi quarantine returns 2,5x2 Sudanese disembark ed at Jedda for pilgrimage this year. Again this year shipping facilities were entirely inadeq.uate. Sudanese (and ¥est Africans) suffer to a large extent from the difficulties as the Palestinians (Q.V.) in that they are depenor^ for s^a transport upon the ships of the Khedivial Mail Line. liUcn many thousands of Egyptians are clamouring for return passages oo Suez, passengers for Suakin cannot expect good treatment from the Company# /There/ (16) There is, however, no solution to this problem at present because the Sudan insist upon pilgrims embarking and at qnakin wh-re the entrance to the port is so narrow and difficult ?Lt onlv small ships can use the port. The only vessels of this size at present available for pilgrim traffic are those of tlle . Khedivial Mail Line. If it were possible to use ^o^.5 5?^ (and better) _ 8hips under British Control could no doubt be found this purpose and this would solve many problBMS connected with these pilgrims. Great difficulty and much hardship was occasioned to these pilgrims this year as the result of a case of smail-poxwhioh was discovered on board a Khedivial ship on arrival at Suakin. This necessitated an increase in the period of ^ u ® ra 5 i:'® a a_ d Suakin which threw the whole shipping schedule out of gear and thereby caused considerable delay to r8 J urn , ns , p ^ 1 ?^®f'„+ to quarantine accommodation at Suakin is clearly insuffi i- handle large numbers of pilgrims of this nort culties already referred to in regard to the use of this p 'by pilgrims.

Special arrangements have been made for this year's pilgrimage to Mecca imported pilgrims pay tariff charges &amp; quarantine fees in country of departure in currency of that country. Question has arisen whether these mut. should be applied to pilgrims from Kuwait and Bahrain. 2. After discussion with representatives of Saudi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and ministry of Finance at present in Cairo have expressed opinion as shipment from Kuwait and Bahrain are not expected to be large and as a sufficient quantity of Saudi nials is thought to be available in those countries, pilgrlffB should provide themselves with baudi currency, ihey should pay pilgrim dues and quarantine fees (166.3 rials ) to Saudi ufficlals on frontier and pay their transport charges in Hejaz as and when they travel. 3.

Bahrain pilgrims who enter Saudi Arabia via Basra will be treated as Iraqi pilgrims and should apply to the &amp;«udi Consul in Basra. They will pay the tariff charges and Quarantine fee's in Iraq in Dinars before starting on their Journey. ^ ^//j Political Agent, Bahrain. (fc lltleal Agency.ERESS C0IIMUMQT3E k The G-overment of India announced on August the 11th that owing to the danger to which pilgrim ships and their passengers would 'be exposed 'by enemy action, no arrangements could he made for the Haj pilgrimage this year 'by sea. Government have consequently 'been investigating the possibility of pilgrims proceeding 'by land routes. These may 'be described as follows : ( i) Via Iraq.. ( ii) Tia Kuwait and Bahrain. (iii) Via Iran. 2. The first two routes involve a lengthy sea journey from India up the Persian Gulf, and are therefore, open to the same objection as the route via Jedda. Moreover the Government of India have learned from His Majesty's Representatives in Iraq, and the Persian Gulf that neither at Baghdad and Zubair nor at Bahrain and Kuwait is there any motor transport available for pilgrims, -'bus even if pilgrims reached these places where they would not be welcome unless they brought their own food, it is certain that they would not be able to proceed farther by car. Nor can the third route via Iran be recommended. Public motor transport services are no longer available in that country; and food is expensive and not always easily obtainable. 3. Any who contemplate travelling in their own cars via Iran are reminded that they must obtain an export licence from the Directorate General of Supply, New Delhi and that it is impossible to purchase either spare parts or tyres in any country on the route to the Holy places. It follows tiiat the smallest breakdown may result in their being unable to complete their journey. The roads are reported to be very rough and the likelihood of breakdowns occurring is very great. 4. The Saudi Arabian Government, who have been consulted in the matter, deline all responsibility with regard to transport for pilgrims travelling overland and will not be albe to spare any cars to assist overland pilgrims in case of breakdowns on the long and difficult journey across Arabia. 5. In publishing this information the Government of India are actuated only by a desire to enable intending pilgrims to avoid fruitless expenditure and unnecessary disappointment.

SARMA 1s&amp; No. 3416/1480/8. Dear Department, We enclose a copy of the revised tariff of pilgrimage dues to be applied in the coming season, which has Just been communicated to us by the Saudi Arabian Government. 2. On the occasion of his visit to Ibn Saud in Riyadh last month, His Majesty^ Minister took an opportunity to suggest to the King that the time had come to consider a reduction of pilgrimage dues, which were so high as to keep away a number of pilgrims who would otherwise come. Similar representations were subsequently made to the Minister of Finance and to Shaikh Hafez Wahba, who seemed both to take the point* 3. In effect, the new tariff, which is the work of Shaikh Mohammed Surour, the Director of the newly-created Depart ment of Pilgrim Affairs, represents a considerable reduction of fees. For example, a pilgrim visiting both Mecca and Medina by camel last year paid total dues amounting to £ 60.8.0. (or 805 Rupees and 6 annas)5 this year he will be asked to pay £ 49.0.0 (or 586 Rupees and 10 annas). Last year, a similar Journey by lorry cost about £ 85; this year, by 'autobus lorry' the cost will be only about £ 61. Moreover, transport fees are now inclusive of all other expenditure (e .g. 'koshan' - travel permits) connected with travel. 4. The fact that a fare for 'de luxe passenger cars' is quoted should not be taken as an indication that such vehicles will in fact be available. Last year they were very few and far between. 5 # The usual reductions and remissions (children under 5 free, between 5 and 10 half price, and Takrunis liable to payment of Quarantine dues and boat hire only) are, apparently, to be maintained. 6, We are sending copies of this letter, with enclosure, to the British Middle East Office, the Chanceries at Cairo, Beirut and Baghdad, the Secretariats at Jerusalem, Khartoum, Aden.

Umm-u 1 -jura' t ; 0.1166 of Bhaabah 15th 1366 ( July 4th 1947) In view of the present difficulties which the Government meet in assisting pilgrims who may come by car or on camels, they have accordingly taken steps fpr the avoidance of the troubles and dangers which the pilgrims who will come overland may undergo. They found it incumbent upon them to request the governments concerned to take on their part the necessary measures for this purpose, and to prohibit strictly the issue of permits to persons who may travel to the frontiers posts without, official passes endorsed by consular authorities in order to enable them to cross the frontiers. The frontier authorities v/ill be, in the absence of such passes, compelled to return these oersons by the same route by which they travelled. Strict measures should be taken to prevent these persons from travelling in an illegal way. The Saudi.Arabian Government cannot extend any help to the vehicles which may stop on the road on account of any defect or shortage of spare parts. &gt;[o, 1820-38/1. i ^; 'i rf- *5^ ' BAHHAIN. .'he 26th August, 1947.

This information enabled the British authorities to make the necessary administrative arrangements for the many Arab and Indian pilgrims in their territories wishing to travel to Saudi Arabia.All documents in the file were circulated to the Political Agent, Bahrain and others from January 1927 onwards. The earliest document circulated was a copy of rule changes relating to sanitation on Pilgrim Ships, printed in October 1925 by the Government of India Home Department (folios 4 to 7).The file contains Arabic transcripts and English translations of the public notices that were published annually in the Mecca newspaper
                           Umm ul Qura. These set out the tariff of fees to be collected by the Saudi Arabian Government from pilgrims travelling to the Hejaz. They were compiled by the British Consul, Jeddah and then widely circulated by the Government of India, Department of Education, Health and Lands.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Hedjaz</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Muslim pilgrims and pilgrimages</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000ae#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
