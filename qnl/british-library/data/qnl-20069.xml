Sir Reference telegram 4463.3# dated 23/10/1$ from Foreign Simla I have the honour to forward the drafts requested. these drafts are based on the assumption that Sheikh Sayid bin Nasir is succesful in his negotiation for the return of the gardens. If he is not it Is probable that farther and possibly protracted negotiations will have to take place. In any case the terms will have to be discussed at a personal meeting with the Omanis. It is therefore impossible to say that these will be the final terms. The people with wuom we are dealing are barbarous and ignorant to a degree and as everytaing at present is naturally in a very fluid state it would be foolish to predict the result. The drafts submitted however reppesent the main and essential points for a settlement and are substantlaly on the lines which Sheikh Isa himsslf Indicated at the last meeting. I would ask therefore that discretion be given me to add minor points provided they in no way Cjr* commit Government % and their settlement would smooth the path and promote harmony. -ally simple so as to admit of easy translation into Arabic.

The G-ovemisent of Inlia has also feksfcxlElift directed that the Political Agent shoull accompany the Sultan on this visit. In view of the present position of affairs it is ifiapossible for me to give the slate of the visit, but it is to be hopel that it will be feasible in January# On this supposition I would ask that a draft programme be forwarded to me ty the Government of Iniiia as some indication of what the Sultan nay expect. I would refer in this connection to a latter No,*08,0. of the aeth.October 4918 sent by Major Haworth on the subject of the Sultan's proposed visit last year. Circumstances have changed considerably since then, and His Highness during the last year proved himself so much more amenable to our advice that I would suggest that during his stay in India he should be treated largely as a guest of Government. The Sultan will only take with him a Secretary and a few servants. I woull recommend that he and his suite be given a passage to Karachi on an R .I .M. ship such as the Lawrence. ^ . H «S. the Viceroy will presumably be in Delhi and ^ 7%he Sultan would of course proceed directly to visit His -Excellency. He does not wish to stay atall In Karachi or Bombay. It would not I iaaagine be necessary for the Sultan to stay more than a week In Delhi, anl after that if he could be the guest of some ruling chief for a short time as suggested by Major Haworth^ it would he most useful. For the remainder of the period of his stay in India I would propose that a house be placed at his disposal in Calcutta or Bangalore. The total period of the Sultan's stay in India would a month t4 six weeks. I can only endorse the opinion expressed by ay predecessor that should the Sultan be treated as a guest the expense would not be great and the outlay would repa^ istelf Eany times, and I would add that in the present circumstances he has a special claim to our consideration* I have the honoui? to be Sir your most obedient servant i * C • S.

Dated 2^ th received 27th November 1919. Have forwarded fei full report regarding present financial position at Muscat including Sultan of Muscat debts, loan , budget and method of repayment of loan. Owing to great delay in mails am sending this telegraphic summary. Claims against Sultan of vuscat amount to Rs.7,50,000/- dollar claims being converted at rate of 250 rupees to the dollars 100 which is rate slightly advantageous to Sultan of Muscat, Committee reduced claims to Rs.6,56 ,165/- and the amounts fixed by Com mittee have been accepted by creditors provided payment takes place at once. Under re-organization of Customs estimated receipts including subsidies per annum from 1st October 1919 to 30th September 1920 are Rs.10,74,000/- and expenditure Hs.7,81,000/- excluding Sultan of Muscat's private account. This leaves balance of Rs .2,93,000/-. Sultan of Muscat wishes private account of Rs.10,000/- per mensem wriich is reasonable and based on October figures and which will leave, Hs.1,73,000/- per annum for repayment of loan and interest and for any extra expenditure. Loan granted to Sultan of Muscat is Hs.5,50,000/- repayable in 10 years, in letter between my predecessor and Sultan of Muscat, there is no mention made of the sum granted \ but only^ of an amount to pay his debts. The extra Hs.1,00,000/- neoessary for payment of debts is due to rise in rate of exchange and increase in interest owing to time and in view ot the lact that at the time of loan was (?) proposed it was impossible to give mor^e than rough estimate see my telegram dated 17th October No. 1864, It is clearly necessary to pay debts in full and clear matter once and for all. It is also impossible to discriminate creditors and my predecessor has already arranged for pavment of chief creditor Mohamed Rdmoo in full see my despatch dated 16th October Ho.2004. From budget estimates it/: ^ it will be seen that State can afford repayment of interest and principal at rate of Rs.43,686/- per half year which will extinguish debt in 10 years see Ap-oendix N Civil Account code Volume 2 and leave a balance in the Treasury even on present estimates which should increase with the revival of trade. I therefore recommend original loan of Rs,5,50,000/- to be increased to Rs.6,50,000 on the same terms and date of placing at dig-cosal of Sultan of Muscat should be ist Jecember 1919. Rs .5,50,000/- has already been placed at my disposal of which Rs. 1,21,400/- were Daid to Mohamed Reimoo and I would request you move Government of India to sanction another Rs.1,00,000/-. Balance of 6,165 of debts will be paid from the State resources Interest due on loan to be paid monthly and repayment of loan quarterly first instalment being payable after 6 months.

The original proposals were designed to secure skio other working more efficiency and greater economy. The present system is not efficient, and results in considerable overwork for the staffp and the longer it continues the worse will be the confusion^ Though for obvious reasons the work will be abnormally heavy at present, yet I do not except possibly in the hot weather, contemplate much reduction in the future. As regards the Agency Surgeon I am in full agreement with the Deputy Political Resident that he is a political asset. The proposals were made however in the assumption that such a person could not be obtained for a very long time, and in this connection 1 would refer to your telegram No. 5228 of 8th May IfIf. Taking into consideration the admitted scarcity of medical officers even in India and Mesopotamia it does not seem likely that one will be able to be supplied to Muscat, which medically is a very unimportant place, for several- / u several years. In addition I am genuinely of opinion that the post is a sinecupe. What there is to do in the hospital is at present done without much difficulty 'by a Suh-Assist- ^ant Surgeono The advantage of an Agency Surgeon would be the confidenoe with which he would inspire the Sultan, and the possibility of his being ableto effect a few startling &lt; cures of distinguished Sheikhs in the interior. There is little chance of hi« being able to effect anything else* The first is however not very important and the chances of his being given the opportunity for the latter are some- -what remote under the most favourable circumstances for several years# It does not seen to me that these problamat- »-ic political advantages justify the appointment of a highly qualified and highly paid British officer in Muscats especially when such officers are anything but a glut on the market* On the other hand an Assistant Surgeon would b be very useful. He would be more efficient and inspire more confidence than a solitary Sub-Apsi tant Surgeon* There will be plenty for him to do» ed If things go well, 'i' rcr.p -r.- i i t and the country is opened up it is possible that there may be a demand for a qualified Medical Officer. But this cannc be for several years and it is during these years that the demani for Medical Officers will bebgreatest elsewhere and the supply least. I can firKi no record of any understanding that an Agency Surgeon would always be in charge at Muscat, as is indicated in the Deputy Political Residents tele- -graau I have no doubt that the Sultan will be contented wi with an Assistant Surgeonas he has been with a Sub-Assist- «ant Surgeon, as the Medical Officer with the Troops has exercised no control at all over the hospitals When com- •-aunications are normal, in case of urgency it would be possible to get medical help very quickly. The absence of a fully qualified Medical Officer is a situation many places3T f ♦ I plfces have to face nowadays, Tne essence of the proposals i that they - hould te eapaole of immediate adoption. If there i an Agency Surgeon who can be sent to Muscat at once - and 1 cannot say that his presence is nece-B'ry nov, except ior political reasons - the question 01 -upplying the oiitic, 1 ^vgent with other assistance in the form of a saeetted officer is of course seryed. On the other &lt;hand if there is not the position rem' ins as before. As regords the duties (2) ^ ! - ^ ^ would point out that daring the present Deputy PoliUOi.l Resident's time at Kuocat the Treasury receipts and expend- -ilure averaged nsRp30,000/- per men err.. It is however tno duties under (1) that I venture to suggest are increasing and must increase. The possible appointment of a European officer in the service of the Sultan would of course relieve the political .-.gent of a certain amount of work. But it is essential that this officer should preserve very strictly the attitude of being in the Sultan's service and not in the British Government's. This will preclude his evet w t- -ing a 5 assistant, or as substitute for the I olitioal Agent when the latter is away. Vhile the troops/ are here i «*w m«y be possible to get an officer to carry out the routine duties on such occasions. But it i not likely th .t &gt;-tj will be here for always and the great difficulty will arise in such oases# C I venture to submit that should iw ct, po sibl to appoint an officer of the Gazetted officer Part II staoiard with some Judicial powers this difficulty would be removed. 1 do not think it would be worth while appointing a British officer unless he wao very junior and the appoint- -ment was regarded in the li ght of trainin fe . in which case the -alary would not be a charge against the ».u3oat office.

It was impossible for G-overn- -ment amidst its ciany other pressing occupations to give any attention tc the affairs of Muscat, and tnis was frankly stated. The Sultan's finances wbps in such confusion and #11' he himsief was in such heavy debt that administration became more farcical every day. Jealous of hia independence he proved exceedingly difficult when the question of any reform which would inevitably mean foreign control, ■w&amp;.s Droached to him. Insistent on his hereditary rights he would have no truck with the rebel patty. At the same time our armed support of aim made it possible for Mm t&amp; impose many irritating restrictions on both trade and persens coming from the Interior. In the interior on the other hand, the trium- -virate had consolidated their power and organised their government. But religious bigotry, the stifling of their trade, and the restriction on their personal movements — all the leaders possess property and relations in Zanzibar- exacerbated their feefcin^s even more towards tkf rei^nins house, and it was not. surprising that when tne Political ii^em, at last got in touch wi^h them, they would not listen to any terms Wiilch implied recogniti n by tuem of even the nominal authority of the Saltan. Fortunately the Sultan himself, hopelessly involved financially and unable to renew his bills, after the almost iudicroaa failure of a fe* attempt© to malte a siiow of force against the rebels wit a his own mm, *tP.5, last realised the Bituatlonjfthat without our armed h#lp he woill be driven Into the sea, without our financial help he would be bankrupt. He therefore consented to un dertake reforms in his adalnistraion, the chief of which was the appointment of a custom director by us^and hiB control of the finances, in return for a loan &lt;0 pay nis debts. In September of this year the Political Agent in a aaeting with Sheikh lea wno had been deputed by the Iman, succeeded in putting our case clearly before the Omani party^*That we had no desire to interferewiththea, but that we coull not permit xjc attacks on Muscat and Matrah and the coast, and we desired a settlement of the present intoleriribifee situation, the result of this meeting was a realisation that reconciliation between the Sultan and the '' for a. Yivsndl t «tfl 'fchoy *©■ tired out by what was virtually a blockade. Minor point* were raleed aa to the return of property and prisoners and the removal of the heavy -s&amp;akat imposed by the Sultan as a punitive , measure. At present it is hoped to conclude an agreement^ in which we shall be the intermediarie^in the form of an exchange of letters between ourselves and the two patrti 4s which will recognise the status quo. Tai s is notuing sore or less than the recognition of interior Oman as a seperate state, with the provisos of noninterference by Oman witi the Sultan's jurisdiction and vi»e versa, and free trade and freedom of intercourse* In other words this is the formal recognition of what has been a fact for nearly fifty years, the soldifference now being that the Interior which does not acknowledge the Sultan is united while before it was not.P.6. The factors that oak® for the possibility or otherwiseof settlement are four , the personal, the religious, the material ani the Arab hims«lf» The personal factors are, ( 1 ) The Sultan Sayid Telmur» There is no doubt that he recognises the Inevitable. He is now so heavily involved with us that it is impossible for him to withdraw even if he wished to. The loan^ the introduction of foreign offcials, and the reform of his administration on lines that must differ consiierably from the theocratic government of the Imam will make him even more unacceptable to the bigoted party in Oman, who though they may appreciate the benefits of our Influence in the improve! rule of the Sultan when they visit the coa»t f would on no account assent to such rule being applieet to then. Sayid Teimur is genuinely ti^ed with the whole affair and the undoubtedly trying time through which he has passed. He is a weak though not am anintelligetj; or unreasonable man. In addition he is so anxious to visit India , in fact this is almost theonly thing that occupies his thoughts at present | that little |i opposition on any point may be expected from him. {a}. The Imam, Shaik h Salim bin Rashid al gsmstZ. Vs karusi. He is the titular head of the opposition movement and the acknowledged religious head of the Abadhi sect ^ven by t.iS most loyal of the Sultan's subjects. As described the other day he is an 'idoV'set up by the two powerful sheikhs^ Isa and Hamyar, an^! who like an ifol may be re moved by them. He is not even so report says ^particularly learned from the religious point of view.StiJl his influence from Ms position if not from his personality is great, most bigoted type as is to be expecttted. He would never oppose the two sheikhi. It is quite possible/ P.7 fez that lie may oppose an agreement In rellgioua grounda, but if the two sheikhe are in favour of it he will come into line. Hi is brother ShelV:h Nasir is an able man, (3) Sheikh lea bin Sa li h al Harithi The head of the Hinawi section of the Omanis and an extremely able and intelligent man, who has male the revolution anl ita eucoesa. He haa given hie worl that he wishes a settlement and that we should help in it.

His influence will undoubtedly be exercised in favour of a settlement on the lines proposed. ( 4 ) S heikh Hamyar bin Kasir al Nabhani powerful and influential man but without one tenth of the ability or worldly knowledge of Sheikh laa. There have been rumoura lately that he had become jealous of Iea f s power and was playing on the religious bigotry of the Imam to render a meeting or an agreement abortive.

(1. x 1 1 U ^ &gt; tC . \ c / we* * / / / t ,v In the last portion of my telegram No .C-16 dated 13/l2/i9 I said that it was not usual to place the 'Lawrence' at the disposal of Political Agents unless she was in the neighbouhood ©xcept under circums^nces of exceptional urgency or importance, I may as well amplify this a little perhaps though the reasons for not doing so are fairly obyious. They are mainly financial, * of oouree, as it costs a lot to send the 'Lawrence' from here to Muscat especially as she nearly always would have to go up to Mohammerah to water first. The 'Lawrenbe' burns one ton of coal for every ten miles - it is about 1600 miles to Muscat miles and back - 160 tons plus (say) 300^up to Mohammerah and back 30 tons. Roughly speaking 800 tons of coal. The Chief Engineer of the 'Lawrence' told me Welsh coal is reckoned at R9,150/- a ton now, which would make total cost of coal Rs,30,000/-. The Deputy Assistant Director Works here happened to mention a prooos of the conderser that he was told to reckon coal at Rs.SOO/- a ton, which if correct would iftouble the figure. In any case whether the figure is Rs,30,000/- or 60,000/- it is rather prohibitive. Again if the 'Lawrence' were placed at disposal of Politic^lj| Agent, Muscat, to go to sur or elsewhere there is no valid reason why she should not 'be placed at disposal of Political Agent, Bahrain, to go to Kattf, or Ojair or Dohab when he wants to do so; or at the disposal of the Consul, Bandar Abbas when he wants to go to Lingah and so on. In fact in former days it was very seldom that occasions of sufficient importance arose to warrant 'Lawrence' being placed at the disposal of a political Agent, as when such important^ affairs occurred ( i.e. Bunder JI spli affair in arms traffic matters, negociations re Arms warehouse etc etc) the Resident always used to proceed to the scene in person.

It will be remembered that as regards the negotiations now pending between the Sultan of Muscat and the Oman party in which v/e are acting as the meliators one of the questions raised on the part of the Sultan was the return of two very valuable gardens belonging to Sheikh Rashid bin Uzzai?. and the Wall of Mattrah which had been forcibly seized by the Omania. At the meetinf Sheikh Isa on behalf of the Omanis, and Sheikh Said bin Nasir promised that they would arrange this matter. Sheikh Said bin Nasir was sent by me to Nizwa for this purpose. That the fulfilment of this condition is essential needs little emphasis. The gardens are private property held under the recognised Mohammedan law, and are not even acquired prox^erty but inherited. It would be imposa- -ible for the Sultan to acquiesce in their being given up, nor could we as mediators lend ourselves to a peace which aKHtx^ke meant the violation of elementary laws of property. In additioU it must not be forgotten that the Sultan, acting under advice from us, has gone a considerable way toward meeting the wishes of the Omanis in the matter of lessenilSCj the Zakat and the restrictions on entering Mascat and Mattrah. The Omanis must realise that they cannotdemand everything and give nothing even when dealing with the Sultan of Muscat.J * w At Nizwa itself the matter has been delayed. News is difficult to get as Nizwa is four or five lays journey. The facts as far as T have been able to ascertain thera are these, and they are interesting as throwing a strong light on politics under the rule of the Imam. Sheikh Isa and Sheikh Hamyar have both agreed to return the gardens, if the Imam will agree. The Imam has told Sheikh Said bin Nasir that he is willing tney should be returned if Sheikh Isa will agree. But there are at Nizwa itself a few 'mutawwa' or holy men who are doing well as holy men always do, out of the confiscated gardens, and they are exercising the stringest passible pressure to prevent the return. The Imam whose word once given is law is terrified of acting against these men who rule xiim from the religious point of view. Equally Sheikh Isa is momentarily nervous of coming to Nizwa where this religious influence may be brought to bear. Both the Imam and Sheikh Isa are therefore hesitating from giving the final word, and the Imam with Sheikh Said bin Nasir is proposing to go to Qabil, where Sheikh Isa is, tnere to decide t^e matter finally. The mutawwa cannot accompany him. Once his word is given it must be accepted, and at the same time he will b» able to say that Shaikh Isa persuaded him, while Sheikh Usa will bw able to say that the Imam ordered him. Absurd as this may seem, I yet think that it is a fairly accurate appreciation of the situation. Sheikh Said bin Nasir is certainly doing nie best and his influence is powerful. By sending a letter to Sheikh Isa on the lines suggested in my telegram of the 2nd January I hope to bring home to the Omanis the practical side of the question and the need for decision. Paced with the necessity of saying yes or no, I have every hope that they will say yes. The leading men desire peace, but it is typical of a theocracy that they fear to act against a few fanatics whom they themselves have In powerf put in power. It la 8trans action only that will bring them to their senses. In the event of an unfavourable reply from Sheikh Isa, I venture to bu ^S 68 ^ foil wing course of action whicn will be fully in accorlance with our treaty with the Sultan while it will commit us in no way, cause us no extra expence anl involve us in no aggressive action. It is only necessary fotLus to cease to RWtfcKa restrain tae Sultan from acts of retaliation against the Omanis. He will inevitably reimpose the full restrictions on entering Muscat anl Mattrah, forbil traling with the Omanis and impose a prohibitive zakat. This will certainly cause dislocation of trade and possibly loss to British merchants. On the other hand it will be only temporary, and it is theoretically fully witnin the Sultan's power to take this action. If this is combined with revised customs arrangements and a systam of guarantees which I have proposed elsewxiere in cases of export from India, this will very rapidly bring iiruvuiti y &amp; the Omanis to reason, „ iU.tad - /U. k t * M i+usv 'U+LM tvJj &lt;&lt;7 ___ Ul-UMZIU I have suggested that the Sultan svisitto ^ India he officially fixed for the beginning of February whether an arrangement is arrive! at with trie Omanis or not. This will not be without its ai feet* I would urge again that in dealing with klli these people wuo are fanatical, ignorant anl barbarous, we must not permit shillyshallying. Should they not agree to the terms they have broken their word to us, and we cannot continue to champion their cause against the Sultan, Tor this ie really what we are doing. For however much it may be st r argued that without our help the Sultan would be driven into ' th» sea, the fact remains that we support the Sultan as the legitimate ruler and the Omanis are the aggressors. Tney cannot eat their cake and have it. ; I have the honour to be , _ ^ /I i I r i*Unier Instructlone from tne Civil Commissioner Baghdad copies forwarded to The Jleputy Secretary to the G-lvernment of India in the Foreign and Political Department, The Deputy Political Resident, Bushire.

To ihe Civil Commissionerp Baghdad, Sir, i 1 have the honour to address you on the subject of the Customs arrang«ffient« in &gt; u «oat and Oman and to invite a reference to the previous correspondence on the subject. The position as regards the Cu«?t0ffi9 is briefly as follows. Government ha granted a loan of six and a half i lakhs of rupees to the Sultan on the security of the Uu toms and the sub»idies # and contingent on our control of the administration of tne Custom through a director appointed by us. On 1st October 1919 the new officials consisting of a director and two aasietants, all Egyptians, commenced their work, A very great itiprore/rient in receipts and administration ha^ been shown in use at and ^uttra. The control of » UBcat and i.uttra is however only half the battle. The Sultan of Oman, whose sway is acknow- -ledged on the coa^t though it is not in the interior, controls customs from Has ^usandum to Has al Hadd, that is over a stretch of four hundred miles of coast containing in addition to uscat and ^uttra the ports of Shinae, Sohar, aftkhm, Khaburah, 5uweik # Odara, Barkah, Sib, iuriyat and 3ur # all connected with the interior, and the latter a very considerable export and import centre* A very large proportion of the trade iB by dhow3 which habitually use these small ports, and is concerned with export of produce from/Q ! i /► from the interior or iinport of goods for the interior, At present customs are theoretically collected at these places by the -oiis, but not a penny ever reaohen ^uscut# iiribery and snuggling are rampant, a condition of affr ira which will increase unless some steps are taken to remfKiy m.tters, a» the more efficient the control at . use at the greater will be th&lt;- tendency to geiu^gle through the ^mller port«, i&gt;uch control will only be pos ible with increased personnel anci th adequate leane ot transport* Ihe Cuttoms revenue is the only revenue of the State with the exception of the * * AKaT * which is a coaetal octroi of 5 percent levied by the Sultan on ^oods coming from the interior. &amp;ven the H ^A&amp;AT M is collected through the Customs which therefore controlihe v/hole revenue of the Btate. On the efficient and profitable admini ^trntio?i the of the CustomH therefore depends ,ec onomic future of the Sultan- te and the security for the repayment of our loan* I propose therefore to consider in detail the personnel, equipment ond /general CustomB arrangements.

Sir I forwari the following note on the Muscat Stato Finan- -cial position as snown aftor four months working of tho new castoaiB arrangements. At Sur tne merchants have effectively defied the customs authorities ami not a penny has been recovered. Over 50,000/- income must have been lost in the four months. I have sug^este^ to H»H a that he should refuse clearance certificates to the Sur Ihows when they start trading in May unless the owners pay up» This will probably brln^ in some of the arrears* Much the same is occuring in the Batinah coast and the income from the ports there is ne^ll- In the rough bullet given in my letter nuiBber 2336 of 28th November 1019 I had estimated Rs» 1,00 ,000/- bein^ available from Sur, and Rs. 50,000/- from the other ports, Owin^ to the unfortunate events of tne last three months I now only anticipate an income of Rs, 50,000/- from Sur and the other ports during tho year ending ioth. Sept# i930« Only Muscat and Mattrah figures are dealt witn. Ihe Income of the Muscat and Mattrah customs has been Oct. 71500/ Nov. 64700/- Dee. 46600/- 57800/- * '• •- Jan.

Tli« i act that the export of rice froa India wae to all Inteneta and purposes closed during the ~ last quarter of the year ( the Infinitesimal allotment of 250 tone Vein., ^Iven ) vary seriously affected customs receipts and was quite unforseeru For the three months of Feb. March and April tale average should be kept up avln* R S . inew&amp;e. For the montiis of May, June and July the Income will dwindle conaldorably owln,_ to tae fact that sailing ships cannot pl y. ar.i tixe Income will probably not exseed Rs. 25 ,coo|_ ( ?5 # v00/- for the three months August sees the beginning of the date seasen and during the months of August and September at least Hs, 80,000/- p.m. siioull accrue ( 1,60,000/- for the two months }. I estimate the years receipts therefore at apprexk- r -matel/ Rs. 8,50,000/- as against R». 7,40,000/- originally estimated. Taking into consideration the probable loes of a lakh on the Bur and Batlnah port customs, it will be seen that the total customs revenue of the Sultan will be about Ra* 7,00,000/- Instead of Rs. ■ 8,90 ,000/- as orlglna lyftiila^ estimatel. This will ^Ive the state an Income with the subsidies of Rs. 8,86,400/- Instead of Rs.10,76,400/-. An expenditure of 9,01,S80/- was budgeted fer, ©f which Rs.1,30,000/- was the Sultan's private purse and 80,000/- for public works. The absolutely essential ex- - penditure I b Rs. 7,01,380/- ( including 40,000/- for The expenditure during the four months Oct. to January on these essential fiervices represented by the figure Rs. 7,0i,.?80/- in the budget and excluding the Sultan 's privy purse, has been 9 i |i 0 IH,K, has no private monetary transactions except wltii H*h«Wi«d Reraoo, and sven in this o aBe has not yet got to tue §t*£e of borrowinc.

Deputy Resident.Many thanks for your letter. I am afrali I have only the very vasuest knowledge afeout official matters in the Gulf. I only wired to you about a ship as I had a dim idea that there were a certain nuaber under your orders and if one couli have been spared it would have been very useful. Of course the expense in such cases as you mention makes the thinj; prohibitive. As a matter of fact affairs in this part of the world are in rather a serious state. I thibk few people realise the absolutely hopeless muddle we have ^ot into as regards Muscat, We are committed to the support of a ruler who would be murdered by his own subjects in Muscat were we to withdraw that support, quite independently of anything the Omanis would do. Though for an Arab not a particularly bad follow^ he is absoltebely without power or the ener&amp;y which ilitht give power. We have paid his debts ^nd for the security of our loan ^to say nothing of the British subjects in whose hands is practically the whole of the trade we have got to try and make his administration efficient and respected. Now he has lost the interior his administration is the customs. Shoul wo fail to do this we are in the cart and the sooner we let the whole show rip the better. It was for this reason that I have always been wanting to get to Sur and about generally^ as it shows a certain interest by the British G-overnment in affairs which is better than nothing. I am afrali that Sur has gone from bad to worse and they can now collect nothing there* atall, and it is a port with as great a volume of trade as Muscat without Muttrah. Smuggling is rampant, and I am afraid ssae of the allotments for other ports in the Oulf are coming Into Sur and the smaller ports. Guarantees are being taken in the case of each rice pass issued now. The price has now risen to R s .38/- p^r bag. Negotiations with the interior are still 7 iraulns .n. The Omanis are ilffioult people and of oourae trm 11' I- 1 r r,fctuSUAM 1 / f y^ttghorly untrustworthy. However I should -et some news by the end of this week. If favourable I shall try and finish the affair at ®nce and get the Sultan off to India. As regards the show generally it is becoming increasingly clear that we have taken action only just in Use. Even with our paramount influence and armed supportnl dont believe the Sultan's government could have survived unless we were going to take a more active part in it. If we can get the regiment away and establish the Sultan's real autherity on the coast it will be all we want to do. Then our game is to cut every possible source of extra expense. The country isnt worth more trouble. Peace with Oman and a jovernaent by the Sultan on the coast which is not a farce are the only things lihich matter. As regards Gazdar I was only referring to correspondence which had taken place between Bill, Haworth and Baghdad. Haworth had also mentioned the question to me before ho went asking me to write as he thought Gazdar had a claim owing to having been kept at Muscat when he was offered Bushiro. Life seems pretty miserable all round just now. There is just a chance that at the best some of us may be holding an intolerable sort of job in two years time. But it is far more likely that we will bo lying with our throats slit or bogging our bread without a pension. For a very junior person the prospect is not alluring, especially when one is married. My wife asks to be remembered very kindly to Mrs.Trevor. // x * ■ ■ s M3tist The Residency, BiiBhire, 23rd February 1920, i received your demi-official letter of (i think) the iSth January about fhe 15th of this month: it went up to Baghdad and other places by mistake. The mails are jki^awfiji J^it now, i hope the Government of India will try and improve them soon. i took your d/o out to answer it but have mislaid it, and as the Captain of the 'Lawrence' is anxious to get off I haven r t time to maka a search for it. But from memory I car answer most of it. I realized that you didn't understand the procedure about snips etc, and that was why I wrote my d/o about*the 'Lawrence'. ^ As regards H.K.Ships,as I fancy I told you^I think some time in December, whenever there* are the proper number / viz three. In the G-ulf one is elways kept at your end - even when there are two it is generally possible for one to visit Muscat pretty frequently. But when there is only one^and an old lame duck at that,like the 'britomart',it is not poseible, I mentioned to the Naval Commander-in-Chief ajpropos of the absence of a ship from Muscat since September^ that there was only one ship in the Gulf,and he replied laughing 'You had the whole East Indies Squadron 11 - and apparently for some months the squadron was^in point of fact ^reduced to Britomart , I think you can depend on the Senior Naval Officer and myself to let you have a ship wb?n necessary whenever possible, and I donBt think we need worry the Government of India / or even the Civil Commissioner Baghdad, with such matters when, we get our full oomplement of ships • L,Wingat© ? Esqr, I.C.S., 1a ; i-- Political Agent, Muscat, v c-I understand that the H Clio M and 'Odin' or 'Espiegle' are comirig baok here - they are old Gulf ships. Muscat is a depressing place I think - I had a year of it one©.- But anyhow an attempt is being made now to get the Sultan 1 aflairs on a 'better footing,. Formerly H.M's Government 'were not keen on interfering ard the late Sultan was not at all anxious to b© interfered with; not to mention the French who didn 1 1 want interference either - except of their own. I don't think things look very hopeful myself but I take rather a more sanguine view than you express in the last para of your letter: perhaps that was a fit of the blues? M P,S« The aboy'- vaa written to send by the Uommander of Lawrence but owing to interruptions it could not b :• copied, in time and got left. Directly. Hughes Hallett left I found your letter of 13th I find I answered most of it all right from memory. I need only say that we have to remember that not only have we got into a muddle by helping the Sultan but he or rather nis father owes 'a good deal of )v s difficulties to his co-operation with us - in the Arms Traffic and other matters, to which his sub jets inland objected - not realizing that the Sultan 's co- ODeration was, at least to some extent, due to .^oroe majeure. It is thus certainly up to us to support the sultan and I am with you every tine when you want to do so. u as stated above it can^ always be done when ships are required unless we have at least S gunboats In the uulf, Britomart was in point of fact just starting on a trip down Gulf to Jask and Muscat about end of January «hen Commander- I in-Chief wired that he wanted her at Koweit on F^ruury 8th, and as urgency at Muscat appeared to'have blown over I agreed with the senior Naval Officer that it was hardly worth while to Ito make tli© oXci do a,'bnnT • P ao about 1^00 milea wnen aho ma 8 o dicky 10 doubt the Commander-in-nhi in omef told you that the 'Clio' and 'Eapiegl e' and 'Odin' a of .hich .era to have oome up the Sulf were detained first at dodeida for the Jacob Misaion buaineas , and then at Berbera on account of the Somali .and ahow. Apparently the 'odin' aent a landing party asnore and blew down a fort and had a fight with the Mad Mullas paopie, and had quite an exciting time generally with fortunately no caaualtieb - or rather only 2 'friendlies* # I think you are doing very good work with the Customs an it mi be a very good thing if you can get them going on at one or t to of the bigger ports besides Muscat and Muttra. But what about the smaller ports? Would it not be best to f&gt;ari71 customs revenue at these places; farming is of course a rotten means of collecting Customs revenue, but in countries where the administration is practically non existent, it is often the only way of getting any revenue at all from outlying Places, I agree with you that if the Sultan can get some authority on the coast and peace with the interior it is all that we can expect. Jebel Akhdar and one or two places in the interior aren T t bad but taken all round the country is bad, and the climate abominable and the people miserable creatures. Vhe climate of Muscat itself would sap any one^ energy in a short time, As regards Gazdar Sir Percy Cox had some objection to his promotion on account of a tendency to intrigue which he displayed wnen acting head clepk at Bahrain and again at Bandar Abbas. I tried to get him a job as a Treasury Officer in Mesopotamia in 1916 but 3ir Percy would not have it. he job at Bushire, if Gazdar was offered it, was only for 6 months or so I think.35/87 k ■' _/•.■sv.

Dated 87 /3 /30. % ~ r J / I have ha I a lon^ interview with Sheikh Said 'bin Naslr who arrived last ni^ht and he also brought a latter from Sheikh Isa. Sheikh Isa states in his letter that he collected his Bhelkhe, brought them before the Imam and asked from tne lat + Br agreement under the mediation of the British Government and the return of the gardens, Owin^ to religious objections the Imam refused this request. Sheikh Isa aids that he hffss that the prisiners will be returned and that Government will continue to be friendly. My interview with Sheikh Said brought out the fact that first the powerful influence of the Mullahs and secondly over confidence and bad management on the part of Sheikh Isa were the two causes which brought about the present deadlock. That the greater part of the country and shaikhs were anxious for agreement he was sure but they were helpless against the influence of the mullahs owin^ to ignorance. He himself coald io nothing and he dii n it see how anything could ever be done My reply was that Isa had assured government that he was the accredited representative of the Imam. By what he had done he iiad oroken all his promises. Government could not possibly treat with such an untrustworthy man any lon 0 er. I should not therefore answer the letter. Then I added that government hal exercised their ^ood offices throughout on behalf of the Oraanis but as they had now refused to accept our mediation which they themselves had originally asked I could not but suppose that Government would not accept responsibility in t^e case of any subsequent consequences on tne Omanis and w ould be inliffeDent in the future as to their well-fare. The effect of this was considerable and he asked me to £rant him time as he said he would at once write tos k 11 jhallch I8 a an&lt;3 - woui(a report ray Interview In f&amp;ll. He would urge lid to collect the shaikhs to influence the Iraara to reverse the Incision L e ciaion as he was convinced serlrous consequences must otherwise ensue. I told him he could do as he liked and he asked the date j,, ^ return from India. There is Just a possioii-ity uuat t-ais ' ha ve some effect. It is obvious that there is Intense difficulty j_r dealing with this loose confederacy and that the most intelli- gent and powerful chief with the great religious leader and supported bv thf British Government sho ild confess himself powerless to achieve .'J 7 J Tv tie the object aimed at is a moat sisnificant fact. In my despatch of the 3nd January the course of action to be adopted has been out lined in the evmt of this having no effect. In India I sha.ll be able to dl3CUi3 9 at length the whole question.. The visit of the Sultan and Political Agent to India is the strongest card we can now play. It is bound to affect the Omanis ^ considerably as they can only interpret it as an additional guarante* of our support to the Sultan following as it does immediately on the repelpt of their answer. The more we uphold hiS prestige now the greater will be the possibility of settling the whole question and because the other side refuses temporarily to come to terms does not justify us in unishing th . Sultan. A good effect at the s.ae time will be produced by MacCollum visiting Hasna and Sur in the Britomartj iTTfnrmpd of the situation and tnat as as Wazlr.

Sir, In accerdance with your request to furnish you with details of the action taken by ae with regard to the Masna affair, I haye the honour to report as follows March 5th # Shaikh Masa t ud bin Zaamit was written to ordering him on board H # M.S. * Britonart ' next morning at 3 Arabic* He was warned that if he failed to be on board at that time he would hare to be responsible for the consequences. It | was pointed out to him that His Highness the Sultan was responsible to H.M.G. for the safety of British subjects and that the attack made by him on Masna caused considerable annoyance and loss to the British subjects liring there. March 6Mi. Masa , ud not haying been on board at the appointed time, I went ashore and wrote to him and to the peenle of Tareef ( « small Tlllas« behind the pain trees and them about two miles distant from Masna ) warning that the Tillage weuld be fired on at 10 Arabia that evening, that the inhabit/- -ants .of the Tillage should leare the Tillage and proceed to a place of safety a few miles to the last; als© the people liTing within a small radius of the Tillage. It was notified that in the eTent of Masa'ud arriTing on the ship before the tine for the Tillage to be fired on no firing would take place. A reply* was receiTed about 10 Arabic from Masa 'ud stating that he was en route for Itasna and would be on board next morning.Tiring was therefore postponed. He arriTOd shortly after sunset and then sent word to me that he would not see me and would not come on b .ard. Ho had with him an amed force of about 200 rifles so it was impossible for the Sultan*s men to make any attempt to detai^n him. To his message I replied that as ha did not intend to come on board&gt;,/ I had no alternatire tut to have his Tillage of Tareef fired on next morning at 4 Arabic but that of course if he &gt;ras on board by then this action would not be taken. At the same time a warning similar to the last was issuedto the people in and ar©und Tareef, March, 7th# Jour o*cl®ck Arabic came and with it news that Masa'ud had left for Muleddah ( a neighbouring Tillage of hi 3 ) openly defying ua. Tareef oould not however he fired on owing to it not heing visible from the sea on account of the intervening palm trees. As Muleddah, which also belonged to Uasa^d, offered a fair target it was decided that the idea of trying to shell Tareef should be abandoned and that Muleddah should take its place t Consoquenl -ly Masa'ud was notified that it was now intended to fire on the latter# Muleddah is a bigger village than T«reef and It was explained to Masa^d that we had decided to destr the bigger village owing to his not coraing in at once. The real reason was of course that we could not get at Tareef and the explanation offered was calculated to saTO our face in the matter. He was told that firing would coamence next morning at 2 AraVic. that it would be continued for an hour after which an hour's respite would be giren to giws him the chance of coming in, that in case he decided to come in he was to appear on the foreshore with a white flag and accompanied by not more than two servants, that if he failed to come then firing would be re-opened at 4 Arabic. Warning was sent to the rillagers to be a few mil West of the Tillage by 2. the time the firing was to coMiaenee* A few of the Sultan- s men wore told off to ry * ^ reed houses in Tareef and towards to burn down some of the + . riae f r om the direction of Tareel evening smoke was seen 4 iot*r showed that about seven and information received later sn houses were destroyed. tfarohUareh 8th. Masa'iaA was not on board by 2 o'clock and in acoordance with my requeBt fipo was soon afterwards open on Muleddah.

Please refer to your telegram No., 4576 of April 15th. At a private interview with His Excellency the Viceroy, at Delhi in March, the Sultan of Muscatmentioned his desire to abdicateand his wish to remain in India. In reply to this His Excellency said that the Sultan could stay three months in India, but must return to Muscat after that. The idea of this was that the Sultan should have ample time to consider so important a decision, and that he would probably change his mind after the rest and change in India. At present therefore the matter is in abeyance but we are consulting Trevor according to your suggestion. Foreign.I Telegram, Code, From - Trevor, Bushire, To - Foreign, Simla.

I think that if Sultan of Muscat abdicates just now when we have just smkaKkgdi established a Wazir' and are initiating reform it would I iia think give excellent opening to Mohammadan agitators and nationalist press to cavil and work up feeling against us, possibly some faction in prance might take matter up^ if On the other hand/His Highness could be induced to return , ^ to Muscat for a year or perhaps even less, until administration reforms have got well under way, and^hen abdicate in favour of his minor son, who could be given a tutor and installed under a Regency, thi^4rrangement in my opinion would be much better. I think we should support the Sultan and his family; there are so many varied toteresta^aHd'no dominating personality that they could never be satisfactory to deal wlti? In fact If the Sultan and his family go under, I think the whole of *r*Ticrf^ries of petty Shaikhdoms whioh Oman would relapse into congeries 01 p would be very inconvenient.
