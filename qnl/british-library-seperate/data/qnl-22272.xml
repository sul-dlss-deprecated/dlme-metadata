            d'affaires. It further notes that the Resident has issued instructions to
            Lieutenant-Colonel Rennett to take on extra provisions, in case the Persian Government
            takes measures to prevent him obtaining supplies from the coast. It also notes that he
            has issued instructions to Lieutenant Hart and Mr Hunter to return to Bushire, so no

            that the Persian Government will take measures against the Residency, so he will remain
            at his post unless he faces the threat of force.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054342.0x000037#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
