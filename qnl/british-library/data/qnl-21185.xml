Sir, I have the honour to enclose herewith monthly statements of accounts^ for the month of Ramadaan. I am sorry that there has been some delay in for warding these accounts. The revenue, when compared to the nrevious month, shows a falling off of Rs 15.000/-. During the previous month however. Rs 10,000/- was received as rent ^or the Bahrain Oil Concession. Customs receipts m Ramadaan decreased from Rs 62,825/- to Rs 55,254/-. expenditure during the two months appears to be the same, but there are outstanding bills from Ramadaan amounting to about Ks 3,300/-, which raises the actual monthly expenditure of Ramadaan to about Rs 68,200/-. The differenpe between the actual revenue and 'kf 16 actual expenditure incurred during Ramadaan is about Rs 5,000/-. . At the end of Shaaban. the expenditure for eight months had exceeded the revenue by Rs 43,700/-: at the end of Ramadaan the expenditure for 9 montns* exceeded the 9 months' revenue by Rs 48,800.

I said,however, that should a large on nela.like that ^ tut at Abadan or Jfoajiri 'i-Oulaiman 'm Persia,spring up,it wouia oe necessary for tne T nidham T (Administration) to be improved and strenghiened,especially the Police,as naturally in a large xield the workers might not always he ox good conduct: and so on. I suggested that ne should consider whether it wouia not ue a wise move to aiviae tne royalty of Rs.b/o/- a ton into parts,part ior nimself and the Al Khalifah and part lor the Government. He at once agreed and said that ne tnougnt a division o0:50 would oe a good thing. I did not maxe any comment uut just left the matter to sink in.

M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. Persian Gulf. Sir, I have the honour to forward statement of revenue and expenditure for Shawaal, the tenth month of the year. There has been another serious drop in the Rs revenue which has decreased from 59,800/- to Rs 43,800/-. -after making thepayments on the Civil List, which absorbed approximately 79-g^ of the total revenue of the month, only Rs 8,800/- remained for the payment of all other expenses, Police, Education, salaries, etc. etc., and as funds were unavailable, bills amounting to about Rs 16,000/- were held over for payment during this month, ShawaaA.D^*= * - , C3 - 2 - The expenditure for ten months at the end of Shawaal, has exceeded the revenue for those ten months by Rs 55,000/-. This deficit on a Budget of which the total is only Rs 6,58,000/- is a very serious one and I consider that there is no pro bability of its being reduced in any appreciable degree during the last two months of this year. It is now the eleventh month of tiie year and next month I prepare the budget for the following year 1352. Assuming that trade conditions are no worse than they have been this year and that the R. E. trade is not affected by any political or other causes, it will be necessary to estimate for a revenue of at the very least Rs 50,000/- less than this year with a corresponding reduction in the expenditure of the State. In the budget of last year, expenditure on headings such as protection, public health, education, muni cipalities etc. etc. was reduced to the very lowest possible amount, and no further reduction can be made in these essential services without seriously impairing their activities. There remains the question of effecting economies, during the coming year, and balancing the next budget, by reductions in the Civil List. Excluding the amount received by the R^ler hi^s^ If, P reduction of l/5th of the remainder of the Civil List would result in a saving-3- saving of about Rs 50,000/- which would balance the budget provided that trade conditions do not further deteriorate. 1 have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, Financial Adviser to the Govt.

Dated, Maharam 4. 1352 April 29, 1953 From The Financial Adviser to the Government, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. To H. B. M f s Political Agent, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. Sir, /&gt;./. I have the honour to forward a copy of the Budget for the State of Bahrain for 1352. It has been approved and signed by H. E. Shaikh Hamad. This is the eighth Budget which I have had the honour of presenting. The annual report on Bahrain for 1351 will be despatched later, it usually accompanies the Budget, but as you required the Budget as early as possible, I am sending it now. The financial position of the State causes me very grave concern; both the new Budget and the figures for the last year reveal a very disastrous condition of affairs and I should be obliged if you would communicate the contents of this letter to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.- 2 - H 0 Comparison 1350 - 1351 . The actual revenue during 1351 was Rs 1,20,074/- less than during 1350. This very serious falling off is almost entirely in Customs receipts. The bulk of imports has decreased greatly and the value of goods imported has also decreased. The people of Bahrain can no longer afford to buy anything except the cheapest commodities. Expenditure during 1351 exceeded the revenue by Rs 93,672/-. Although the expenditure during 1351 was actually less than the amount allocated in the Budget, the revenue fell short of the estimated amount by Rs 1,05,302/-. Briefly, at the end of 1351, the State was faced with an actual deficit of Rs 69,132/-, having also spent the sum of Rs 24,540/- which was carried forward from the previous year. The Reserve Fund at the beginning of 1351 was three lacs; at the end of 1351 it is only Rs 2,50,000/-. This year, for the first time since a budget has been made in Banrain, I have nad to siiow a deiicit on the revenue side of the budget in order to balance expenditure. It would have been possible, and tnis suggestion was urged by the Shaikhs during discussions on the subject, to estimate the revenue at an amount much greater than could honestly be expected, in order to balance the budget. In my opinion it would be false finance and would serve no useful purpose. The deficit will be met from what remains of the Reserve.Revenue, In last year f s Budget, I estimated the revenue at Rs 7,89,600/-. % estimate was incorrect, the actual revenue collected was Rs 6,84,298— (excluding Rs 12,447/- which was transferred from the Police account to the Consolidated Fund) Customs receipts last year were estimated at Rs 7,00,000/-, actually they only produced Rs 6,00,684/-. Owing to the deplorable condition of the pearl industry, the continued decrease in amount and value of imports and the probability, which is now almost a certainty, of Bahrain losing its R.E.trade, I consider that the most that can be expected from the customs this year is Rs 5,50,000/- which is it lacs less than the estimated customs revenue for last year, but only Rs 50,684/- less than the actual customs receipts received during that year. The total amount expected from all other sources of revenue is estimated at sligntly less tnan last year’s total. This amount has been arrived at after careful consideration of the actual receipts for lo51. Rents of Government lands has been somewhat increased* This item includes the rent from the oil company (Rs 10,000/- per annum) and also rent of aerodrome. I have assumed that the long deferred payment by the Imperial Airways for the use of the aerodrome will materialise during the year. Interest on reserve has diminished; the rate of interest is now much lower than before and the capital has dwindled. A new, but very small, source of revenue is the tax on artesian wells used solely for cultivation.^ \ % -4- The amount owing by Mohomed bin Subah, chief of the Bin-Aali, which was lent to him several years ago by the Government, is shown as a possible receipt, but I am extremely doubtful as to whether this loan will be repaid. Mohomed bin Subah has now induced the Ruler of Kuwait to intercede with H. E. Shaikh Hamad in connection with this debt. Should the Bahrain Petroleum Company enter into the mining lease in December 1933 an additional Rs 20,000/- will accrue to the State but as they have now applied for an extension of the Prospecting License I cannot assume that they will pay the extra amount. Expenditure . The expenditure in the new Budget has been reduced to Rs 72,100/- less than the estimated expenditure for the previous year. Owing to the death of the late Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali, a saving of Rs 42,000/- was effected. The monthly emolument which he was induced to accept in the year 1347 was Rs 5,000/- per month. After his death H. E. Shaikh Hamad was persuaded to agree to a monthly payment of Rs 1,500/- instead of Rs 5,000/- to be shared by Shaikh Sir Isa f s v/idow and various other relations. When the time arrived for making the new budget, H. E. Shaikh Hamad after discussing the matter, instructed me to explain the financial position to Shaikh Monomed, Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Salman. After several long meetings during which the whole financial position was thoroughly reviewed, the Shaikhs were made to realise that some reduction should be made in the Civil List. Shaikh Abdullah had previously agreed, during informal-5- informal conversations with me on the subject, that this step was inevitable and essential. Shaikh Salman appreciated the necessity after examining the figures, but Shaikh Mohomed was consistently opposed to any reduction v/hatever and was only induced to agree to it by his two relations after lengthy arguments. Shaikhs Abdullah and Salman were at first inclined to make a reduction of 5$ or even 6% but the proportion was eventually reduced to which was the most that Shaikh Mohomed would consent to. I suggested that the Ruler’s own emolument should not be reduced in view of the necessary expenses per taining to his position; my suggestion was vehemently opposed by the three Shaikhs who declared that their financial obligations,as the three leading Shaikhs of the family, were equal to those of the Ruler. This opinion is one which cannot be maintained and it is not accepted by H. E. Shaikh Hamad. H. E. Shaikh Hamad, with great reluctance, accepted the suggestions, but at the end of the year, when the budget had actually been drafted, he wrote to me and pointed out that both the Hon’ble the Political Resident, and the Political iigent had assured him that his allowances should not be further diminished. In view of his letter wnen the budget was ready for his signature, I altered the figures and cancelled the reduction effected by the reduction on the amount received by H. E. Shaikh Hamad himself. Eventually the total saving by this 2$ cut resulted in Rs 6,000/-, but it must be admitted that the appreciation by the Shaikhs of the principle is- 6 - is of more lasting value than this negligible sum that has been saved. Economies have been made wherever possible in other directions. Education has been reduced by savings have been made in some of the departmental expenditure, and these reductions have been accomplished without materially affecting the essential activities of the State but the total amount allocated on the expenditure side, apart from the Civil List, is the very lov/est sum with which the State can continue its present functions. It would endanger the state of Public Security to reduce the newly organised Police Eorce, or the naturs; the sum allocated for medical services is very small in proportion to the needs of the public, in fact if money was available this is a department which more than any other deserves extension; the municipalities too, without their monthly grant of Rs 1,000/- each, which is exactly half the subsidy they used to receive some years ago, would not have suffi cient funds to oavvj on the very useful work which they do today and which is perhaps one of the most conspicuous advertisements of the improved conditions existing now in Bahrain. In spite of the amount which was saved owing to the death of late Shaikh Sir Isa and the 2-&amp;fo reduction on the Civil List, the total sum required to meet the Civil List is Rs 3,80,1)00/- which is 59*8$ of tneestimated revenue and considerably over half the total annual expenditure. • * . 9 IbAlfO■—MM-7- I have referred to this matter very frequently during the year when forwarding monthly accounts and it may appear that I am stressing the matter unreasonably, but as it is one of my duties to compose the budget and to be responsible for the finances of this State I should be failing in my duty if I did not take this opportunity of'stating that it is my considered opinion that the finances of Bahrain will never be on a satisfactory footing unless the Civil List is made to correspond, to a certain extent, to the actual revenue, increasing and decreasing according to the income of the State. The proportion was laid down when the State was comparatively wealthy, unfortunately since then the revenue has diminished by half, but a reference to the comparison of revenue and civil list, which I enclose shows that the fluctuations of the revenue have not proportionally affected the Civil List. I also wish to point out that is impossible for me A myself to persuade the Ruler and his relations to accept ■ -• '&gt;J|L a further reduction. In a l etter I wrote to the Political Agent some years ago, I explained that cwing to my position and work here it was extremely difficult for me to coerce H. E. Shaikh Hamad into agreeing to a course which he strongly disliked. To endeavour to do so would jeopardise my relations with him. If this State finds itself in serious financial difficulties it will depend upon the Government of India for monetary assistance. Excluding the possibility oi increased revenue from oil it appears to me inevitable that within a year or two the State will be approaching a condition of bankruptcy. If the Government of India- 8 - India comes to the conclusion that the Civil List requires readjusting it will be necessary for it to express this opinion very definitely to the Ruler himself. I have advised, and urged and argued on the subject and the only result which has been obtained is a saving of Rs 6 ,000/- out of a total of Rs 3,86,000/-.

Bone alleviation of the position has been given by the death of Bis Excellency the late ftir *l*a bin All A1 'Italifah and of other wembera of the A1 tOmllfah ^Cmily. ''he old and acknowledged ouetom of the *1 tfhallfah that, iden a nowber of the family dice, his allowance reverts to the Euler, has been upheld, in spite of opposition, and a fair proportion of the allowances of those reoently deceased has been allowed to lapse to the fttate. Tn another connection His Excellency nhalkh Hamad bin •tea Ai Khalifah has proposed to inotltute a ^mily Hajtia(Council) to advise him in such natters, and the idea has witch te commend it. 6. The tariff on certain articles of inport has been raised, but it is too early to judge to iCiat extent this will benefit the revenue.S3 7.

I venttire to think that the Govern ment of 7 *ahrain ie much to be conirratulated # both on takinr an action ao unprecedented on the Arab Littoral and on the excellent reaulte. ft. X fear that the financial nonition* in flahmin an eleewhere* preeente a gloomy picture, but it is hoped that the discovery of oil will place the finanoen of the State on a more satiefactory footing. Opportunities have been taken of putting into the mind of Hin Sjtoellency ^aikh Fanad the idea that it was desirable that the revenue obtained from oil should be divided in some fixed proportion between himself and the Adminis* ’ tratinn. His Tbreellenoy evidently brooded over this matter, for he has now himself eugrested that a division should be made in the proportion of one^third to himself and two-thirds to the Administration. The matter has not vet been placed on a firm basis, an negotiations regarding the exploitation of the oil are still in progress, but the fact that His Tbtoellency has himself made this suggestion, and has proposed eo reasonable a proportion, may be regarded as of happy augury. 9. In oonolusion, X venture to make the warmest conmenda- tion of the work performed by the financial Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Hr. C. !&gt;. Belgrnve.

The revenue shows an increase of approximately Rs 10,000/- over the revenue of the first three months, of the year 1351. The revenue during the first three months of this year exceeds the expenditure by Rs 4,000/- approximately. At the end of the third month the State had a balance of Rs 5,189/- but against this it owes Rs 8,000/- to the deposit account. The Reserve is Rs 2,50.000/- and so far this year, it has not been necessary to draw upon it. The revenue for these three months includes Rs 40,000/- being amount received from pearling licenses, the actual customs receipts are less than last year.

From The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. To H. B. M's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to enclose a statement of revenue and expenditure lor the six months ending with Jamadi-al-Thany which shows the financial position of the State at the end of the first six months of the current year. 2 . T^iis year, as mentioned in my letter No. 17/Slfof 29th April 1933, I was compelled to show a deficit on the revenue side of the Budget of Rs 90,329/-, so far, however, during this first half year, the expenditure has not exceeded the revenue. At the end of the half year the State has a balance of Rs 4,868/- and it has not yet been necessary to withdraw any money from the Reserve, Rs 250,000/-,for current expenditure. 3 . In spite of this the position is not as Ss satisfactory as it appears; it would be incorrect /Xincorrect to gauge the revenue for the second half of the year according to the receipts of the first six months. This year the revenue of the first six months has a somewhat fictitious value. It includes, under r Customs T proceeds, the sum of Rs R£4,000/- which was obtained from pearling licenses. Every pearling license has now been paid and during the next six months no further revenue will be forthcoming from this source. Unfortunately the pearl season has been worse even than the preceding years, the bazaar is heavily overstocked with rice which was imported by merchants who expected to sell it, as usual, at Ghuffaal. This year at Ghufaal, the end of the diving season, nobody has any ready money ?ith which to buy rice and the merchants cannot afford to sell at long term credits. Until this very large stock is exhausted no more will be imported and customs on imported rice, which is the staple food of Bahrain, is the main source of customs revenue. 4. During the first half year, Customs receipts including pearling licenses, have averaged Rs 56,000/- per month. It is improbable that during the next six months customs proceeds will average more than Rs 35,000/- per month. Other sources of revenue, as shown on my returns, show a nett deficit of approxi mately Rs 16,000/— on the lirst half year, but the actual expenditure is Ss 1,600/- less than the estimated amount. The revenue from sources other than Customs will improve during the second half of the year as certain payments, such as the oil concession rent, areare not due until during the second six months and this year it can be reasonably assumed that the State will receive an addition Rs 20,000/- from the r\ rent for the mining lease and also rent for the aero drome for which no payment has yet been received. It is probable that by the end of the year the total receipts other than customs may aggregate the amount which they were expected to produce. This being the case the total deficit at the end of the year will amount to perhaps slightly less than the Rs 90,000/- which I estimated. I do not wish to be unduly pessimistic but these are the conclusions which I have arrived at after carefully studying the available statistics and considering the probable developments during the remainder of this year. 5. The main source of the State’s revenue is the customs receipts. Excluding boat and pearling licenses, which are included in the monthly returns under ’’Customs proceeds”, the total receipts ^rom the customs during the first half year amount to only Rs 20,600 more than the corresponding six months of last year in spite of the very considerable increase in the rate of customs duty which is now 10$ on certain imports which were previously charged only 5$ ae,valorem. According to Customs statistics for the first half year I find that if the old rate of duty had been ma intained the receipts from Customs duty would have amounted to Rs 4,500/- less then during the corresponding period of last year. This falling oft is due to the fol lowing reasons. In order to show them I have made my calculations on the supposition that the old rates are still in existence.-4- j* 6 . (a) Steamers' cargo shows a decrease of Rs 7,000/- due to direct transhipment of rice to mainland from steamers within port limits and slack p ness of trade in tea and loaf sugar. (b) Native craft duty shows increase of Es 4,500/- owing to increased import of flour from Iraq and tobacco from Batha. (c) Passengers baggage shows decrease of Es 1,900/- the import by passengers from Persia of carpets and galims has decreased. (d) Export duty shows decrease of Rs 800/- due to direct export of dry dates from mainland to India by s.s. 'Fagervick” 7. One steamer, s.s. 'Fagervick' went direct from India to the mainland and this one boat caused the Bahrain Customs to lose about Rs 5,000/- of customs duty which it would otherwise have collected if the freight of the steamer had passed through Bahrain in the usual way. This is some indication of the probable effect of a monthly direct service between India and the mainland. 8 . As after the first six months the State has 0 a credit balance and the expenditure has not exceeded the income I think it is not a suitable time to suggest any change in the Civil List. I fully anticipate P)A that after the next three months and at the end of 0‘' * the year the State will be faced with a heavy deiicit, ^ ' though perhaps slightly less than the deficit which I estimated in the Budget. If this is the case I consider that the Civil List should then be re- adjusted Pr 0 P° rtionately t0 the decrease in the reVenUerevenue as has frequently been suggested before. I have the honour to be, Sir, Adviser to the Government of Bahrain. Enclos.CONFIDENTIAL.

An examination oi the heport shows that the present condition of the State finances can only be desoribed as most serious and the Government of India note with great misgiving Mr. Belgrave's opinion that the State is at present heading for bankruptcy and may in a few years have to turn to the Government of India for financial assistance. They realise that the discovery Oj oil in Banrain may eventually effect a very considerable improve ment in the revenues of the State but they consider that the fact that an increasing incane may be derived from this source in the future does not in itself Justify the continuance of the present state of affairs. They observe that in the year 1545 the total revenue of the State was 3s. 11,91,8lO/-tOf which a sum of Rs. 4,50,094/-, equivalent to 45 per cent, was absorbed by the Civil List, and that in tte following year the percentage or Civil List to total revenue dropped to 57.3^ per cent.

Hie Shaikh and the Al Khalifah family will of course count considerablv on the Oil. Hie reply to that might be that when the Budget is being drawn up, the exact amount which the State will get from the Oil will be still uncertain, and that therefore economic the next year will have to be made without too much to what Oil will bring in.

Dated, Shawaal 21, 1352 February 6,1934 From The Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. To H. B. M T s Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to forward particulars of the revenue and expenditure of the Bahrain otate ior the first nine months of the current Arabic year which ended on January 16,1934. I regret the delay in forwarding these returns which is mainly owing to the recent holidays. The financial position is briefly as follows.- 9 months 1352. Revenue - Rs 5,35,228/- Expenditure 5,38,4587- Deficit Rs 3,230/- 2* In addition to the deficit shown above, bills amounting to approximately Rs 3000/ were outstanding at the end of the month thus bringing the total deficit upto approximately Rs 6000/-, in spite of payments by the BahrainBahrain Petroleum Company amounting to Rs 21,54l/- (of which Rs 10,000/- was expected.) If the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s payments had not materialised the State would have had a deficit of Rs 27,500/- approximately at the end of the first nine months. A sum of Rs 8,000/- which was borrowed last year from the deposit account, has not yet been repaid. 3* The following is a summary of the budget position at the end of the nine months.- Revenue . Estimated revenue - Rs 4,76,378/- Actual revenue - Rs 5,35,228/- Excess over the * budgeted amount - Rs 58,850/- * this includes Rs which only Rs 10, Expenditure. Estimated expenditure Rs 5,44,125/- Actual expenditure - Rs 5,38,458/- * Difference - 5,667/- * Rs 3000/- outstanding reduces the difference to Rs 2,667/-. In the budget a deficit of Rs 90,000/- was expected. 4. The following is a comparison of the revenue and expenditure during the first nine months of 1351 and 1352. 21.500/- oil receipts of 000 /- was expected. 1251 1352 difference. Revenue Rs 5,36,393 Expendi- Rs 5,85,182 Rs 5,35,228/- Rs 5,38,458/- Rs 1,165/- Rs 46,724/-.Taking into consideration the unexpected receipt of Rs 11,500/- from the Bahrain Petroleum Company it is evident that revenue from the usual sources has decreased approxi mately by Rs 12,000/- in nine months when compared to the previous year. Expenditure has been reduced by approxi mately Rs 43,000/- allowing for the unpaid bills outstanding at the end of the nineth month of 1352. 5. To cover the expenditure for the remaining three months of 1352 at least Rs 1,80,Q00/- will be required. I consider that it is unlikely that the revenue for this last quarter will exceed Rs 1,30,000/-.

New Delhi, i'he 20th December 1933. My dear I’owle, pH Please refer to your official letter No.1848- S of 1933, dated the 1st December 1933, regarding the financial position of the Bahrain State. The Government of India agree that you were right in not selecting this opportunity for tackling the Shaikh. The position is however impossible, when the Civil List absorbs,60 % of a falling revenue and the budget is not even balanced. The Government of India would hardly agree to give a loan in order to stave off bankruptcy caused by such proceedings; and if the Shaikh is forced to apply for a loan on e of the conditions upon which iasist they will certainly txMimt will be a very large reduction in the Civil List. He would therefore be well advised to set his own house in order and to avoid having to apply for a loan, the grant of which will have such serious consequences for himself and his family. I am to suggest tnat the above may be impressed onthe Shaikh when you have a talkwith him on the subject. To Yours Sincerely, Sd. H.£.F, Metcalfe. The Honourable Lieut .-Colonel T.C.vV.

I have written it in general terms beca use 1 regard (and mostly with a view to stopping new expenditure)/ it as essential to make no real move till the acquisition of land has been completed. Practically the only direction in which retrench ment is possible is the Civil List,and it would be most unwise to touch,or even to let the Family think that ke had our eyes on it, till we have got our land; for there are a number of ways m which a disgruntled Al Khalifah could put a spoke in our wheel. 1 hope that you will agree with this view. 3.

I have replied that I have written to you on the subject. 2. Shaikh Lii’aij was married on the 13th April, so that the grant of an allowance to nia is appropriate, and the amount i j ^ . therefore, proposed is suitable. The boy ie a favourite son and it would,/ be very diificult, especially in view of the expected royalties irom oil, to reiuse the Shaikh’s request or to reduce the amount. ✓ 3* i would, therefore, propose to accede to the Shaikh's proposal, but to use the opportunity of this request to strength en our hands in two ways. 4. Firstly, I would accede to the request subject to the coat of the allowance being met from the one-third of the royalties on oil which are to be paid to the L'haikh for the v&gt;ivil List. This will, i hope, help to establish ‘f&amp;Sr^y tne /principle&gt; V V principle tliat tixe one-third payable to the Shaikh must bear any Civil i-ist payments which he may wish to make to his relatives. 5. econaly, I woula remina him that, though it is hoped I that considerable sums will accrue to him from oil, yet tne oil may cease to flow, or there may come a time wnen it noes not pay to continue to piece it on the market; and say that it would, therefore, be wise, whenever a new allowance is granted, to ensure tnat, when allowances cease through the death (which God forbid; of any member of the i-'amily, the Committee who examine the ; question should endeavour to apply the amount which has reverted m m \ to the liuler, as far as possible to meeting the cost of the new alloimncew I will, moreover, take what opportunities I can of empuaeiaing verbally that the day is past when a Civil List can support an indefinite and growing number of a ruling Family. 7. A reply would be of greater weight, and more likely to be accepted without criticism, if it is given at once, and, if you appro?© of the above proposal, it woula be convenient if you would telegraph tne one word 'MARRIAGE'; otherwise I will : wait for your instructions.

It is assumed that tnese amounts will be finally adjusted by Mr. Belgrave on his return from leave.

Sir, I have the honour to forward a statement of revenue and expenditure for the first half of the current year which ended on 29th J, Thany 1353, corresponding to the 9th October 1934. 2. Apart from payments received from the Bahrain Petroleum Company the revenue is almost the same as that of the first half of the previous year. The actual revenue for the period under review amounts to more than half the total revenue estimated in the Budget for the whole year 1353 by Rs 54,665/-, but as this includes certain receipts such as pearling licenses which are paid at the beginning of the diving season, it cannot be presumed that the second half of the year will be equally pro ductive .3. The total expenditure for the first six months exceeds last years expenditure during the same period by Rs 23,105/- and it exceeds the budgeted amount by Rs 21,174/-. Of this expenditure Ps 16,053/- has been spent upon the Manamah Maharaq road and Rs 5,242/- was paid to the Electric Supply department and it is likely that before the end of the year a further amount will be required by the Electric Account to enable it to continue working. No provision was made in the 1353 budget for expenditure on the Sea Road, but this undertaking was made possible by the receipt of money from sale of land which is shown in the enclosed statement but is not included as ordinary revenue. No provision was made in the Budget for a deficit in the Electric Supply Department. 4. The financial position of the Electric Department is at present most unsatisfactory, ihe supply of light and power in Manamah and Muharraq is an expensive luxury which is being heavily subsidised by the G-overnment. Loans are being made to the Electric Department by the Government with small prospect of their being recovered. 1 will forward a report on this subject within a few days. 5. At the end of the first six months of 1352 the total amount in the Government accounts was Rs 2,54,863/- including the reserve, at the end of J/Thany 1353, the Government have aa reserve of 3 lacs and also a sum of Rs 1,22,793/- in its various accounts.

M'g Political Agent, BAHRAIN. u tii- Sir, I have the honour to inform you that with regard to the present state of unemployment in Bahrain and the agitation existing on the subject His Excellency Shaikh Hamed considers that the most effective reply which could be given by the Bahrain Government to the people would be to continue the work of building the Muharraq Manama road. This provides employment for large numbers of Bahrain subjects who spend the money which they earn in the Bahrain bazaars. The financial position of the State is considerably better than it was last year, apart from expectations of increased revenue from oil royalties there is now a Reserve of 3,00,000/- instead of 2,50,000/- and a balance of approximately Rs.68,000/- in the bank instead of an overdraft of approximately Rs.2000/-. Much of this money is derived from sale of land but during the year Rs.30,000/- has been spent on the road and about Rs.33,000/- was paid to the personal account of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamed. It is very difficult to make an estimate of the cost of completing the road, apart from the ferry, but I consider that it could be finished at the cost of not more than Rs.80,000/-. I would suggest that the work should be carried on at the rate of not more than 10,000/- per month in which case I feel certain that the road will be finished in a year from the time that work is resumed. I am obtaining particulars of a ferry which exists north of Baghdad and which I think could be used here. Apart from the question of unemployment, which is at present a very genuine matter, His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamed regards the completion of this road as a metter of the greatest importance.

Sir, I have the honour to forward for your informa tion a statement of revenue and expenditure for the first six months of the current year. 2. The revenue is Rs 13,500/- less than during the corresponding period of last year and it is 16,000/- less than the amount which was estimated in the Budget. The expenditure exceeds the revenue by approximately Rs 6,000/- . 3. This deficiency is because no payment has yet been received from the Bahrain Petroleum Company on account of royalties on oil. In the Budget it was estimated that Rs 1,65,000/- would be paid by the company to the government on account of royalties during the current year. The amount which is now due to the government after deducting one third which is payable to the Ruler’s Civil List and after refunding the proportion of the loan which was made to the govern ment ..government by the company, is Rs 88,540/-, The royalty due from shipments made by the company during the second half •£ year of 1935 already exceeds the sum due from the first half year by a considerable amount. In addition to this it is possible that there will be^shipments dur ing 1935. In any case the amount estimated from oil royalties in the budget for the current year will be exceeded and it can be assumed that at the eno. ot the year the State will have a surplus. 4. The expenditure and revenue under the various headings do not differ greatly from the estimated amounts. The figures for the first six months however are not in all cases a sure indication of the following six months, the revenue increases and decreases during certain seasons and many of the payments which are made to the govern ment are not spread equally over the twelve months of the year. Apart from oil revenue I am of the opinion that the amounts estimated for under the various headings will be obtained by the end of the year and it is possible that there may be a small surplus from sources other than oil. This is somewhat surprising as the 5tate of the diving industry is going from bad to worse but usually the effects of a bad season are not reflected in the customs receipts unxil the following year. The position of the pearl market at present is that all the sea nakhudas have sold their pearls to shore merchants but only a few of the merchants have been able to dispose of their pearls.-3- 5.

The Political Resident said that he had received a letter from the Government of India wnich showed that they were taking the possible recurrence of a deficit in the budget very seriously ana the question of the propriety of such a high figure for the Civil List. The Political Resident said that the question was somewhat similar (though somewhat more complicated) than at Muscat. In Muscat certain proposals had been put before the Sultan who had been asked to make his own proposals for balancing the budget,the schemes being merely communicated to him for his assistance. 2. It was decided that Mr.Belgrave should mention the matter to His Excellency Shaikh Hamad and that on the Political Resident’s return from i^atar the matter would be discussed again. b.KO'ho S.No:61.

Letter No:C/461 dated 29/4/1934 to Resident. % Shaikri T Abdullah came to see me on the morning of the 2nd May 1934 about the question of the allowance to Shaikh Lua T ij. He said that Shaikh Hamad had sent my letter to him in oruer that he should speak to me. Ee^mentioned the arrangement of the T thilth f which was share. He apparently claims that he had meant the one-third to be his personal share and instanced some time ago a conversation between him, Major Holmes, Shaikh Hamad ana the Auviser, in which Major Holmes had suggested a division of one-third to Shaikh Hamad, one-third to the revenue and one-thira to be used for matters connected with the oil, increased police and so on. I asked what Major Holmes had to do with a matter of this sort and why it was being discussed with him. Shaikh f Abdullah said that it was just ordinary talk. I said that Shaikh Hamad had told me in the Joint Court one day that he had proposed to divide the money, one-third to himself and 2/3rd to the revenue and that I had understood it to be one-third to Shaikh Hamad for any allowances that he would like to make out of it. Shaikh f Abdullah said tnat Shaikh Hamad would no^ doubt accept what we said but asked that the matter should be considered. 2 . 1 personally think tnat it would probably be better to reach some compromise on the subject, provided that we can safeguard the revenue from being overwhelmed by enormous allowances.

I mentioned this case to the P*R* when he passed through on the 14th May and he was of opinion thfct we shd have to take a stand on the A1 Khalifah as an whole being included in the one third share which was to go to the Shaikh. I spoke to Shaikh ’Abdullah on the 19th May and drew his attention to the disproportion of the civil list to the revenue&gt; and warned him that the Gove4nment of India were seriously concerned at the figuces,which were much higher than in probably anyother place. Shaikh ’Abdullah said that formerly the Shaikh had taken all he could get and that now there was a proper budget which hadbeen balanced. He however, agreed that the matter needed discussion and said that they themselves had said one third to thb'I5Ea; one third to the Government and one third for expenses connected wi£h the oil development i.e. salary of another British Officer. (I am not clear that this is really what wjas meant). In cO,Election with the allowance to Shaikh Du’aij he pointed out that a good deal had lapsed to the State recently owing to the deaths of Shaikh *isa. Shaikh Ibrahim and Shaikh ’Abdul Wahab : and said that they qmite understood that the civil list could not support ihnpmera ble A1 Khalifah. In connection with the oil royalties I impressed upon o him that they meat not count too certainly upon them and shd'build up a reserve so that they might not suddenly be let down in the future. I instaneed the case of Lord Linlithgow,whose Father (and himself) had had large sums from shale royalties which had now given out with un fortunate results. The matter will need further discussion. 20.5.34 r.A /l*. May this pend further? On the 24th May 1934 Shaikh T Abaullah came to see me and reverted to the subject of giving half the balance of the land acquisition money, after recouping the reserve and taking Rs.30,000/- for the bridge, to Shaikh Hamad. I explained the figures in the note above (which showed that there was a balance available of Rs.64,704/-)• i said that 1 would write to the Political Resident to whom I had already spoken on the subject. Shaikh T Abdullah said that Shaikh Hamad was very anxious to have some money (he specified Rs.10,000/-) at once as he had various expenses connected with the coming of the summer. Shaikh f Abaullah persisted in asking for consideration of this matter and argued, not without force, that the Shaikh had sold the land and also that he had made no difficulties in the matter or receiving a share, i said that the Resident would be back from Muscat shortly and offered to write by the next mail, Re said that tney were quite willing that that the matter should be thrashed out at leisure but would like the Rs.10,000/- today, if possible. 2 . it is difficult to refuse the request ana I fancy also that the money is needed partly for the expenses of Snaikh 1} ’Abdullah T s forthcoming visit to Damascus, which is to be made in order to get special medical attention for one of - ■ ■. ,■mmmM wmmmm mh ■ S.No:94 S.No:95, P.

The Abstract.of Revenue and Expenditure for the 1st three months of the year 1353 does not accurately represent the financial position of the Bahrain Government at the end of three months working, since the amounts realized by the Bahrain Government for Government land acquired by H.M.G, have not been taken into account. These will presumably be adjusted by Mr. Belgrave on his ‘return from leave. 2). Of the amount shown under loans Item Nq: 1 . Rs.33,352/- will eventually be debited against the sale proceeds of moneys realized from lands sold to H.M.G. Item No:2.

During the next financial year (1354) the Bahrain Government will receive considerable payments from royalties. On the two shipments that are to be made the royalty will amount to approximately one lakh of rupees. 2 . The ferry used north of Baghdad may not be found suitable for use in the exposed area between Manamah and Muharraq on account of tides and high winds.
