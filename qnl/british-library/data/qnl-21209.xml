C«A*F*Dundas, Esquire, British Counoll Representative, C/o The Political Agent, Kuwait•&gt; Confidential D^O. .No. C/425 Bahrain, March 27, 1941 Dear Alban, When Dundas was here we heard and discussed with him his somewhat vast proposa-^ls for making Bahrain the educational centre of the Gulf which was originally suggested by Vallance when he first reported on education in Bahrain. He said he would send a detailed note of his plans and suggestions to supplement the rough note which he produced at the meeting: persona-dly I found this note ra-ther difficult to comprehend. It is not certain whether he will obtain sanction from the British Council for all or any of the proposals which he discussed with us and in any case I imagine that it will he a con siderable time before anything materialises. 2. In the meantime would it be possible to inform the British Council that if they are prepared to help us # what we require now, more than anything else, in my opinion, is a competent headmaster for our Technical School? The person who I believe would be extremely suitable for this post is Mr. G.E.Hutchings of the Baghdad Technical School who came here last year to advise us on Technical Education. 3. I understood from Dundas that any help from the British Council would depend upon the number of boys from outside Bahrain who attended the schools. I think it would be interesting to know whether this condition is definitely official, it does not seem altogether compati ble with what I have heard and read about the objects of the British Council. In the case of the Technical School(9 - 2 - T&gt; School in any case we have already eight foreign pupils working there. When the school moves into the new workshop, which is nearly ready, it is possible that we could increase the number of outside pupils although we have numbers of applications from Bahrain * boys who have been refused admission at present because the existing building is not large enough to hold any more boys. 4. If it is likely that we could get more help, in addition to a headmaster for the Technical School, it would be very useful to have either one or two English masters to teach English and other subjects in English at the Kulliya. At the end of its first year there will be 60 boys in this school and in the third year there will be 90 boys. At present there are about 30. Vallance and our teaching sta~ff are now able to deal with the school but when it doubles and trebles in size it will be necessary to have more masters and if there was at least one English master for this school its efficiency and value would be greatly increased. 5. If the British Council would give us some help now to enable us to have an English headmaster for the Technical School and possibly another master for the Kulliyah it would in no way interfere with Dundas’s scheme, if it comes off. It may be a long time before this scheme is approved and if the British Council is inclined to give us more financial help we can do with it now to pay for these masters. This matter has been discussed with Shaikh Abdullah and he and Vallance are agreed that what we need now, mostmost urgently, is the Technical School headmaster and one or two English teachers for the Kulliyah.

No. 601/22 Bahrain, April 17, 1941 Dear nib an, With reference to our conversation regarding the appointment of Hutchings as headmaster ol the Government Technical School. Hutchings is willing to come here on a four years contract terminable by three months* notice on either side, salary £1,000. per annum, no increments, no house allowance or family allowances, Iclass passage from Baghdad to Bahrain and from Bahrain to United Kingdom on termination of contract. J ^ I have discussed the question fully with Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa alkhalifah and with Vallance. Shaikh Abdullah wishes to offer him the appointment atonce with out waiting for the British Council to decide whetner it will contribute part or all of his salary. If, later, the British Council decides to give us financial assis tance we shall be glad to have it. Shaikh Abdullah knows Hutchings and formed a good impression oi him and he would like to obtain him rather than someone who is a stranger to us. I share bhaikh Abdullah*s views. Our next term will start in October and Hutchings is going on leave in June and would not be required to com mence work here until October. I have informed His Highness about the matter and Shaikh Abdullah is going to discuss it with him tomorrow.Hutchings is not directly connected with the British Council so we could make our arrangements with him without previous reference to the council* Providing that His Highness sanctions the appoint ment have you any objection to Hutchings being definitely offered the post on the terms which I have mentioned and a draft agreement being prepared?

In addition Colonel Prior, Major Alban (Political Agent, Bahrain) and Major Galloway (Political Agent, Kuwait) have severally informed me that the education of boys from the Gulf area in surroundings where British influence predominates would have far-reaching political results. This is particularly important, as further exploitation of oil in Eastern Arabia must lead to increased commercial development and increased possibilities of foreign,i.e. non-British, interference. At present the only even partially trained and qualified teachers are Syrians, Iraqis and Palestinians and it is not easy to obtain the best types* As (a result, many undesirable teachers are employed in the schools at Bahrain and Kuwait. The establishment of a Gulf College would in a few years’ time enable the greater part of the teaching throughout the Gulf area to be undertaken by teachers who had received the greater part of their education in Bahrain./ 2) PROPOSED GULF COLLEGE. J' 1. I discuseed fully with Mr.Vallance, Director of Education in Bahrain, his ideas for the education of Gulf hoys from the age of 13 plus upwards. His present intention, as I understand it, is to retain the existing three big junior schools at Manama, Muharaq. and Hedd as feeders for the senioi school or Kuliya, which was opened in the autumn of 1940, and for the Technical school. Selection for the former would be entirely by open examination. Boys from outside Bahrain who wish to attend the Kuliya would do one or more years in one of the three other schools. The Kuliya course would last for three years, at the end of which time it might be possible to have some form of Higher School established in Bahrain. 2 # l think that the main objections to his suggestions are: l) the dispersal of foreign students amongst the existing junior schools, the Kuliya and the technical school would offer little inducement to boys from outside to come to Bahrai n • 2) The principle of admission to the Kuliya by competitive examination only would mean that the sons of Shaikhs and other notables would not necessarily be able to obtain any education after the age of 13 plus. I am convinced thatprovision should be made for them to receive further schooling if their parents wish, otherwise there will be discontent at the Government’s refusal to provide education for them. 3. After discussion with the Political Resident, the Political Agent and the Financial Adviser to Shaikh Hamad, I agreed to put forward proposals for a Gulf College which would combine a junior section, senior section and a technical section under one administration. It would be possible to reach and maintain a higher standard in the junior section than would be possible in the three existing junior schools, and by running the three sections as one unit considerable economies could be effected in staffing and other running costs. The whole could be housed in fine buildings with adequate grounds and playing fields which would not only be a draw for boys from outside, but a cause of satisfaction and pride to Bahrainis. 4 . It is very difficult to forecast the response with which the Gulf College should meet during the first fev; years but I believe that it should be started as a going concern with the boys in the present technical school and Kuliya as a nucleus for the technical and senior section, and boys between the ages of 9 plus and 12 plus accepted for the junior section. The numbers would be low for the first few years and therefore expenditure would be on a smaller scale than in the estimates given below. In addition, the cost of buildings for boarding accommodation and to a lesser extent classroom and staff accommodation could be spread over a period of 3 to 4 years. 5 . The basis on which the following estimates are put forward is: 1 ) Number of boys who could be readily absorbed in the Gulf area from technical section •• 50 per year2) Number of boys who could be readily absorbed in the Gulf area from senior section ••• 50 per year. The former would be drawn mainly from the sons of working class or artisan parents and the latter partly from the sons of Shaikhs and merchants on a paying basis and partly from candidates successful in open competition for free places. Fifty per cent. (or perhaps slightly more) of the places in the College would be reserved for Bahrainis. 6 . These numbers would presuppose an intake of 100 boys per annum and I suggest that in conjunction with the technical and senior sections a junior or preparatory section should be formed, giving a four year course of general instruction with Arabic as the language of instruction but with English taking an important place in the curriculum so that at the age of 14 considerable fluency would be obtained. 7. The intake of the junior school would in theory be 100 per annum but it is probable, particularly at first, that parents from outside Bahrain would be unwilling to send their sons as boarders at the age of 9. The full complement of Bahraini boys could be taken each year, say 40 - 50 and would be mainly day boys, though boarding accommodation would have to be provided for those from outlying districts of Bahrain. If boys from outside are attracted the junior school might be made up as follows: Bahraini First year 9 + • • • • Second year 10+ •• •• Third year ll-*- •• •• Fourth year 12+ •• •• Special class for boys from outside Bahrain aged 13+ •• •• Others. 5 45 10 45 15 45 25 15 Total Grand total 180 70 250 8 . When the numbers were stabilised this would give an output of 85 boys per annum from the junior section, allowing a further 15 places per annum to be given to boys from the other junior schools in Bahrain or from outside Bahrain. 9. The following buildings would be required t 1) Junior Section la)olassroom accommodation etc.for 25C boys. —— (b)boarding accommodation for rather more than 70 boys. (c)accommodation for staff. 2) Senior Section (a)classroom accommodation for 150 (assuming ' — a 3 year course). (b)boarding accommodation for rather more than 75 boys) (c)boarding accommodation for staff 2) Technical Section — ('a)classroom and workshop accommodation for 100 boys (assuming a 2 year course )n (b) boarding accommodation for rather more than 50 boys. (c) boarding accommodation for staff.-3- 10• It can readily be seen that by combining the three sections very considerable economies could be effected in building alone. The following would be required: (a) Boarding accommodation for rather more than 195 boys. (b) Boarding accommodation for the staff of the College. (c) Classroom accommodation(and workshops) for 500 (100 technical)• 11 . I am in no position to estimate the cost of these buildings, fudging very roughly from the hospital which I saw, I would guess something in the neighbourhood of £ 30,000 exclusive of equipment which for the technical school has, I understand, been estimated at £ 5,0005 for the junior and senior schools I estimate about £3,000# 12. The main recurrent expenditure would be on staff. There should be three English masters, one as head of each section with the head of the senior section Headmaster of the College. The details of curricula wpuld have to be worked out by the Headmaster and on this would depend the staffing requirements. As a basis for estimates I suggest staffing expenditure as follows : Three English masters at £1,000 ) 900 ) with residence 800 ) ■ Senior School 9 junior teachers, average salary £300 p.a. « 2,700 Technical school 10 instructors, average salary £300 p#a. 3,000 Junior school 15 junior teachers, average salary £300 p#a. 4,500 i £ H* to 03 O O 13. If accommodation is available for unmarried members of local staff or those with families outside Bahrain a saving of at least £1,000 per annum should be effected in the three section* as salaries could be reduced by some £50 per annum. The totale xpenditure account would therefore be approximately as follows: Non- Recurrent Recurrent Building .. • • £30,000 Equipment(te chnical,furnish ing, etc.) 8,000 Salarie s # • •• £12,900 House expenses F o od # • •• 3,500 Fuel •• •• 400 Wages •• # • 2,000 5,900 General expenses / B/O 18, 800Non- Re current • Recurrent. B/F. General expenees • Electric Ti ght t water Travelling expense b R epairs and renewals -Postage, telegrams, telephone Insurance # . Upkeep of grounds Sundries £ 38,000 etc. £ 18,£00 £ 500 200 500 100 100 200 1, 600 3, 200 £ 38,000 22,000 14. I am unable to give any estimate of income from pupils fees. Boarders ought to pay something between £50 and £100 per annum according to age, and day boys £10 to £30. If half the places were 'free', it ehould be possible to get between £10 and £20 per boy on an average, for the whole 500 day boys ana boarders inclusive,i.e.between £5000 and £10,000 per annum, reaving £17,000 per annum at most to be found from external sources • 15. BU g£eBtion i B that the Government of Bahrain should pay 50/® of the cost of building and equipment and 50/5 of the estimated deficit, £8,500 per annum on the figures I have given. The nritish Council would be responsible for the remaining 50$. 16. These figures of expenditure on staff are those which would be necessary if the school contained the 4 junior years, 3 senior and 2 technical years, almost irrespective of the number of boys in each year, and the deficit arrived at represents the maximum deficit, in the first few years expenditure would be less, and if the school is successful, after the first few years tne receipts should increase. I do not see that the school could ever become self-supporting but the deficit might be reducec to between £5,000 and £10,000 per annum. 17• Staffing It would at first be necessary to employ Arab taachers from byria, Egypt,Palestine and the Sudan. But it should be the aim of the College to provide scholarships for its pupils to proceed to higher training colleges in these countries or in England. The pre-war cost of scholarships would be roughly as follows: England £300 per annum per student Egypt £200 ' » » » Beyrout £180 « • • Sudan £130 18. Three to five yearn'study would be required by each scholar so that the cost would be England £900 to £1,500 i-er student. Egypt £600 to £1,000 • Beyrout £540 to £ 900 • Sudan £390 to £ 650 • These sums for hahrai, is would have to be met by the Government of / BahrainBahrain as the scholars would be returning to take up posts in the Gulf College. In from 10 to 15 years the whole of the ’*local’ , staff of the College should be Bahrainis. 19. The obvious advantages of such a College as I have outlined would be: 1 ) It would provide a sound, liberal education under British influence for boys in Bahrain and the Persian Gulf, up to the age of 1? • (The small numbers available would make any higher training college in that area uneconomic, ^t would cost less to send boys on scholarships for further training to Bngland, India, Egypt, etc.) 2) Boys who have spent 3 to 8 years at the Gulf College would be much less prone to unfavourable influences in Iraq, or elsewhere than they are at present. 3 ) It would provide a nucleus of technically trained boys for employment in the Gulf oil area. 4) It w :uId help in extending British influence and ideas amongst the sons of important residents in the Persian Gulf area. 5 ) It would provide a basis for the training of teachers for the more important schools throughout the Gulf area. 20. I suggest that the College should be given a charter by the Shaikh of Bahrain, setting out the constitution of the school. Its purpose and the type of education which would be given. The main points included should be; I) the school would be administered by a governing body on which the Government of Bahrain, the Agency and the British Coundil would be represented. II) the governing body would appoint the Headmaster who in turn would appoint the junior staff. Ill) the composition of an executive committee selected from the members of the governing body should be laid down. IV) the Headmaster would be authorised to refuse, or to dismiss, any pupil. V) the language of instruction in the junior school would be Arabic but the minimum number of English periods per week would be laid down for the various sections of the school VI) a minimum number of periods per week would be laid down for instruction in the Arabic language and in the Moslem religion. VII) certain specified subjects in the Senior and Technical School would be taught in English. VIII) an English examination would be recognised as the final examination of the senior section. if the British Council considers that it is possible to finance the proposed Gulf College I suggest that the Political Resident should be asked to put these suggestions before the Shaikh of Bahrain and if he approves in principle / the- 6 - the charter should be drawn up and signed. A headmaster should then be appointed forthwith to advise on and assist in the construction and equipment of the school, the selection of staff, etc. Assuming agreement to be reached during the summer of 1941 I estimate that the following expenditure would be required for the financi-1 years 1941-42,1942-43,1943-44 (ending 1 March 3lst). would amount to about £22,000* The income would depend on the number of fee paying pupils attending the school. 1941-42 &amp;uilding(including architect) Technical equipment and furniture Running expenses,headmaster*s £ 10,000 6,000 salary etc. £ 1,000 1942-43.

Education Office, Manamah. 13 May 1941. Dear AiJiyciy^ , In continuation of our telephone conversa tion of this morning, may I just put on paper the salient points, in case you might like to have them before you when you are writing to the P.R. Hutchings . (1) H. has never been an employee of the British Council, nor does he in any way come under their jurisdiction, or under that of Dundas. (2) quite apart from the trouble in T Iraq, H.’s contract ends this year, i.e. he is an absolutely free man at the end of June. (3) I have a letter written by H. a few weeks ago, after he had seen Dundas, in which he makes it quite clear that he wishes to come here, and does not wish to work under the British Council. (4) The Bahrain Government has ascertained from H. the terms under which he w'ould be willing to come here as Headmaster of the Technical School. The Bahrain Gov ernment is “Tiling to appoint him, whether or not fin ancial help is given by the British Council.When Dundas was in Bahrain I told him that the Government » anxious to employ Hutchings here in the Technical School. replied that he thought that Hutchings would he quite the best man for the job, and that he would do his best to get him for us. A few days later, Hutchings wrote from Baghdad that D. had advised him not to go to Bahrain, and had promised to get him a better job in Egypt, in spite of this, Hutchings pre ferred to come here. He knows Dundas well.Dundas. D. has no official standing whatsoever in the Persian Gulf. He is in no way responsible for Government edu cation, in any part of the world. He was appointed by the late Lord Lloyd to act as disburser of British Council grants in Egypt and ! Iraq - not in any way to make or withhold grants. It is not correct that all correspondence between Middle Eastern authorities and the British Council must pass through Dundas. I have in my possession two letters from the British Council, one written by Lord Lloyd himself, and the other by the Secretary, asking me to communicate with them direct, and offering' us financial assistance if needed. I have no doubt whatever that the British Council in London has no idea of the tactics employed by Dundas on his various visits to Middle Eastern and Arabian States. The two (or three) Assistant Masters whom ^e wish to employ, with British Council assistance. The important point is that these men should be selected and appointed by us, and not by Dundas, which he will try to do. The British Council is perfectly willing to allow local au thorities to appoint their own men, even where the whole of the master's salary is being paid by the Council. It is most important that we should get into Bahrain men who have already proved their worth in 'Iraq, and not entirely new men from England, who would constitute a mere lottery. Only about 40^ of the men who have been sent out to ' Iraq as teachers have been successes. I know personally which are the good men, and I know several who would come to Bahrain. ^ A A - V/xtUUuCXa/ijC*. irs v. sincerely,SaagMiBSlal D.O, Mo.

JUNTAS 1 3 VIJIT TO IH^ GULg From 19th February to 5th March» 1941 General 1* I arrived on February 20th before breakfast and left in the afternoon of February 25th. Juring my stay I was the &amp;uest of kr. Alban,the new political A£ent. Colonel x^rior the xolitical Resident in the x-ersian Gulf was also staying at the agency. I was shown every kindness and given every facility for discussion and investigation by these two and by Mr* Jalrymple lielgrave, financial Adviser to oheikh Hamad. The island has a definite British flavour though it was suggested to me that some of the younger generation show a tendency to doubt the value of friendship with Great Britain. 2. The educational standard is low but this I do not believe matters provided the education given is sound. Vallance has already made good progress in this direction. I am not,however, in agreement with his theory that a general education should cease at 14 for everyone except those who can pass a competitive examination into the Final Gchool or M ivUliya% I believe it is essential for sons of sheikhs and important people to be able to continue their education. It is platitudinous to say that an unemployed effendi class must not be created; but the children of *notables' are not likely to be un employed, and until oaahrein becomes much more socialist in structure, the sons of notables (irrespective of their ability to pass examinations) will hold most of the positions of importance. The suggestions put forward in another section of this report (Gulf College) show how I consider the problem might be met.BRIl'IjIi C0U HG1L. C.- IRQ lul. OKI OK *at.

There are niraours of his having struck a student# and while I was la Bahrein a telegram was received from Galloway In Koweit saying that the Koweltl hoys In Bnhrein wore complaining of their treati^ent by hlnu Vy own impression woe that Veil once was &lt;iulte out of touch with most of the teaching stPfr of the schools in Bahrein* He told me himself that he hod never spo en to the five Palestinian teachers who arrived in the autumn as they were thoroughly bad end unpleasant people* He hardly knows Sheikh Abdullah bin Issa Al Khalifa who has the title of Minister of Sducetion# is the 3rd brother of the Sheikh of Bahrein and is an interesting and quick witted person with strong views* Vallance says that he is ignorant, uneducated, cannot read, write or speak a word of Snglish, and is not worth consulting* This is, I am certain, the wrong approach and I am satisfied that ill&amp;nce is not a s iitable man for his present post. Furthermore, wten I met Galloway in Basrah I found him definitely unwilling to allow Vallance to re-enter Koweit* He had found him pugnacious and unwilling to carry out his duties thoroughly, and he considered that Vallance’s visit had Produced nothing of value* g From his own accounts the reforms instituted by him in the schools of Bahrein are bearing fruit, but I am doubtful of hie wisdom in so rapidly instituting a system of superannuation* The policy which he is folio,»in allows of no education for those over 14 unless they can pass a competitive examination into the Final School* This year some 60 boys have been turned out of the schools, many of them sons of important people* i oeiieve this to have caused considerable dissatisfaction and I feel it is dangerous to run an educational system on purely selective lines particularly in a Sheikhdom* The sons of Sheikha and of rich merchants require as good an education as can be given for they ore certain to teke a large part in the life of the state. 3. Bel grave was less certain of VallaJiee t S unsuitability and pointed out that ruch had been done in the last two yet re* I think Belgrav© is kind hearted and also unwilling to have someone appointed whom he has never ae0n Since Vallance is under a 5 year contrect vter.dn&amp;ble by either side at 3 months notice) to the Bahrein Government, no change can be ,»ads by the Council. If a change is to be made there are two possibilities* • /• (q) Bel grave to be induced to arrange for the termini tion v of Vail once* s contract. , . (b) The Council to inform the Government of Bahrein that they are unwilling to continue to pay the *500 a year for Vailonce*s salary* The second course has the disadvantage of interfering unasked in the aoleotlon »nd dlaudMal of a Bahrein Oor.rna.nt Official, and I believe th* t it would be far better for the suggestion to come from within* i. am rSJ, or m. report to the Political Resident and th. PoliticalAgent together with covering letter asking artvat action they advise* I suggest no action should he taken by the Council until their replies are received* 4 # If a successor is to be found for Vallance I suggest that one of our own taen should be seconded. The two most suitable are Hollyer and &lt;v&amp;kelin* Hollyer is probably (nore capable of doing the job successfully though Wakslln's experience in Abadan would be of value* The poet u»iy well develop into a permanency and although I do not want to lose Hollyer indefinitely I think he should be offered the chance* I am suggesting* however* in another section of this report that he should be given the opportunity of going for a year to 3 oweit* though other developtasnte may require his presence elsewhere*1. I met Mejor Galloway* the Political Agent fop Kuweit# in Basra where he hnd gone for a few days* shooting* He did not consider that any useful purpose could he served by ray visiting Kuweit in his absence and as I was unable to wait until 3rd March# we discussed whi?t could be done by the Council during the next year* He expressed great dissatisfaction with Vallance*s last visit (OctobejMToveiiber 1^40) and said that there was no prospect of any improvement under existing conditions. He fully agreed with Ma^or Prior*s suggestion that the Council should offer an 'education advisor' for a limited period of one school yeari ;he advisor would advise the Sheikh on 'educational and cultural affairs. I fully support this recoBsaendation since education in uweit is badly bogged at the moment# none of the education committee having any knowledge of education* 2* Until a better basic education is given to Kuweiti youths I believe that they must remain a prey to Iraqi or any other outside influence. 3. I recommend therefore that a sum of six hundred pounds (:600) be set aside during the financial year 1941-42 to enable the Council to offer an educational advisor to the Sheikh, end that one of our own men whould V &gt; seconded. On the assumption that Hollye^a value to the Council will# In the long run# be as an administrator rather than as a teacher I suggest that he should be offered the post for nine months from the first of October 1941. 4* If the Council is willing to finance this appointment the lolitioal Kesldent should be informed so that the offer may be transmitted to the Sheikh of Kuv.eit. \ .

The Director of Education in Koweit# Abdul Ajaba# boa no aduoational knowledge and therefore hie recowmendatione c&amp;n carry little weight even in his own country# I recommend that he should be given a short visit to the Sudan or /den at the Council’s expense and shown something of the educational activities in either of these countries# It is difficult to estimate the cost# as methods of transport ere so uncertain# His air return passage from Basrah to Khartoum would be ±145# His journey overland# which would take about 10 days each way# would cost approximately flOO end to this would have to be added food and accommodation an route. His expenses in the 3udan would not be high - say £V&gt;0 for two to three weeks# 2# Aden could be reached by boat to Bombay end from BonSbay to Aden# This might entail aoroe delay waiting for a connexion in Boidbay# Fares would be about ±125 return# The Director of Education in the Sudan has already informed me that he would welcome Abdul Ababa's visit and arrange for a bear leader# 5. If the Council agree to this visit# please inform the Cairo Office and the lolltical Resident by cable# with a copy to the Political Agent at Kuweit# so that arrangeiuents can be made for hie visit to take place in ;&lt;iay or early June.

In ray conversations with the British Consul, ?4r* 4 J ell8 Forester, and business men, I found the opinion strongly expressed that an Institute should be opened in Basra with the least possible delay# we are, however, hamstrung, as is so frequently the case, by the lack of qualified staff. The only possibility is Tett and I am very very doubtful whether he is the right man. Basra would be difficult in any case and it would certainly be wiser to wait until October when it should be possible to provide someone more suitable. I suggest that if anybody froai aiaongst the new men who are due in this area appears to be a likely candidate he should be sent at once to Baghdad to spend a few months there under liorray before going to Basra. I do not like being unable to respond to the Basra 3.0*3., but on balance I think we ^uld gain by waiting, unless there are very rapid lailitary developments In that part of the world, in which case Tett should be sent without delay. / \Oener&amp;l For never*! ye»w past the oilttoil Resident in the erelan Gulf hra felt Inoreaelng une stneeo r t the extent to which boys fron the Oulf i ron h ve been ^beorbing ^tl«^rltl8h politie^l theorlee by attending edue* tion Inatltutione In and yrln* There le no doubt that the oovemnient of £ra^ la alive to the poeelbilitiee of 'Infecting* students from the Oulf (particularly I tnveit) and in nmxiy eases free places have been found in Ira il institutions for boys from the Arab coast between Kuweit ittid luU&amp;cat* In this connection I would refer you to the following documents*- 1) Ur# o#R#l«# dr i tji-v ? 11 1 ,nco 1 a letter to Mr# C# alryuple Bel grave of June f?6th» 1939# /~n _ S) Mr# 0# ^elryiple Belgr? vo’a letter to i tr# r . elgjhtman of Jxily Dth#lJ39 3) dir Btsll Hewton l 8 &gt;)eep^ tch no# 159 of ^ reh diet# 1940» to the Foreign office* In addition Colonel rior, Hejor ;lbfjn (: olltlerd /gent# Rtihreln) end Major Oalloway ( oliticfl A^cnt, Kuweit; have severally Informed me that the education of boys from the Oulf area in surroundlnge where British influence predominates would hrve far-reaching politick results# This is particularly l^ortant# tm further exploitation of oil In 3astern robi« must lead to increased conlorcifl development and Increased possibilities of foreign* l*e» noiv-i rltiah, interference# t present the only even partially trained and qualified teuohere are iyrlane# Iraqis and Palestinians and it le not easy to obtain the best types# as a result* many undesirable terchere are eriaployed in the schools at Bahrein and Kuweit# The establishment of a Gulf College would in a few years 9 time enable the greater pert of the teaching throughout the Gulf area to be undertaken by teachers who had received the greater part of their education in Bahrein# The establishment of a Gulf College would In a few yearsX # I diacuasod fully with Zip* Vtllimoe$ Director of Kd loatlon In Bthreln* his Idaea for the eduoatlon of Oulf boys fraa tha egn of IS plua upwards.

Bahrain, May 31, 1941. Dean Alban, With reference to your C/438 dated 13th May 1941, I have read with interest Dundas’s letter and report and would like to discuss it with you when you have time. My immediate reaction to the proposal is that this is a most inopportune time for embarking on a scheme of such magnitude. The war is now very close to Bahrain and there is a definite possibility of damage being done to the oil field and refinery which would result in an immediate change in the State’s financial position. If our oil revenue ceased we should have to reduce our expenditure by at least half and we could not contribute to the initial or running costs of the proposed college. While the war continues in this part of the world it is unlikely that people from the other Gulf states would consider sending their sons to school in Bahrain because since Bahrain has become an oil centre it is regarded a probable target for enemy attacks.

I discussed Dundas’s letter with Belgrave and our feeling is that the scheme is too hig and the financial commitments too heavy to be embarked on without expert advice such as you have sugyeited in your demi-official fo • letter ??o. 270-9'dated 1st Ney 1941 to Wei^htmsn. Bel- grave also feels that Dundee has largely over-estimated the nivnber cf students from outside Bahrein who are likely to attend and it is hardly likely that there will be any parents rillin' to pay such high fees as are suggested. 3 . The scheme aopears to contemplate the closing down of the existing Junior Schools at Vbhnrraq and ^edd and making the boys go to the T unior Section Manama. This may not be a very popular move. There ere other questionable points in his letter and in the draft agree ment. which would have to be clarified before the scheme Hon'ble lieutenant Colonel could /- C.

Dalrymple Belgrave, &gt;«eq* s C*H.H*, Adviser to the Bahrain Government,D.O. No. 1028/2E Bahrain, June 11, 1941 Dear Alban j Referring to our talk on 7th June about Dundas* scheme for establishing a Gulf College in Bahrain. I think it is advisable to put on record some of my views on his proposal. 2. I have discussed the scheme with Shaikh Abdullah. We are both of the opinion that this is not the time for the Bahrain Government to incur heavy financial liability and to launch a scheme whose success depends so much upon the support from neighbouring Gulf States. We think that while the war continues in this part of the world the Bahrain Government should confine its activities to improving and expanding local education in Bahrain on the lines on which we have been working during the past year. Shaikh abdullah is naturally more interested in the education of Bahrain Arabs than in providing educa tional facilities for foreigners from other parts of the Gulf. 3. There are various statements in the report which call for comment, some of them are criticisms of the educational work in Bahrain which appear to have been made without knowledge or foundation. It is stated in paragraph 1 of the report that many undesirable teachers are employed in the schools of Bahrain and Kuwait. The majority of our teachers are local Arabs, carefully chosen, who in some cases have served satisfactorily for ten or fifteen years.The Syrian teachers were personally selected by President Dodge of the American University of Beyrout and with the exception of the late Syrian Superintendent of schools they have proved sucessful. The Palestinians were recommended by the British education authorities of that country. Should an undesirable teacher get into the education system of Bahrain he would very soon be removed. I fail to see on what grounds this sweeping statement was made by Dundas who visited the schools once, with me, during his stay in Bahrain, and appeared neither to understand or to take interest in the masters or in the work which was in progress. 4. The Bahrain Government has always contem plated the eventual substitution of foreign teachers by local teachers trained in the government schools. This was one of the main reasons for the establish ment of the Kulliyah last October. almost all the local teachers, male and female, were trained in the government schools but for some years to come it will be necessary to employ a certain percentage of Syrians, Palestinians or Egyptians, as is being done at present and as is recommended in Dundas f report. The principle of increasing the British teaching staff in the Kulliyah and in the Technical School, when possible, was accepted by the Bahrain Government. At present the Director of Education teaches himself in the Kulliyah. 5. I asked Vallance about his conversation with Dundas and I understand that nothing resemblinga discussion took place but that Dundas set forth some of his proposals without asking for any infor mation on what was now being done in educational matters in Bahrain* 6. On page 2, section 2, there is a reference to the system of competitive examinations for admis sion to the Kulliyah which, according to Dundas, might result in sons of Shaikhs and notables getting no education after the age of 13* This suggestion shows an ignorance of the educational position in Bahrain. a boy who was incapable of passing the Xulliyah entrance examination could not arrive at the top class of one of the other schools at the age of 13* Dull boys are forced by the examination system to spend a second year in each class which means that a dull boy starting school life at six or seven would not be ready to leave school till 16, 17 or even 18 at which age young shaikhs normally marry. Sons of shaikhs and notables are already well represented in the Kulliyah. There are, in addition to government schools, two flourishing private schools, one in Manamah and one in Muharraq, attended by about 200 and 100 boys respectively. They are patronised by sons of shaikhs and notables as well as lesser fry. Shaikh Abdullah has suggested giving these schools some financial help in the same way as has been suggested in the case of Mutawa schools. The boys who are unable to pass the examination into the present Kulliyah are really stupid and would act as a drag on the more intelligent.A competitive examination appears the most fair and reasonable method of picking boys for advanced education. Last year it is true that a number of boys who failed in the examination had to leave school because they had completed their course and were too old to be kept on. Some of the parents resented this and special classes were opened for those boys who wished to continue their education. Only a few boys availed themselves of the classes. The weeding out of such a number of older boys was not a normal procedure but was necessary on this occasion owing to the reorganisation of the system. 7. In section 3 of the report it stated that it would be possible to maintain a higher standard in the junior section of the proposed college than in the three existing junior schools. There seems to be no justification for this statement. It would certainly be cheaper to combine the three proposed new schools in one building but at the same time the existing schools at Hedd and Muharraq, and probably Manamah, would still be required. The government would have to provide schools for boys who were ineligible or unable to pay for the tuition in the proposed college. 8. In section 4 Dundas mentions the difficulty of forecasting the response to the scheme. I think before embarking on so costly a scheme an attempt should be made to ascertain what response was likely from other Gulf States. I know that replies to enquiries would not be reliable but at least it might be possible to discover how many parents in Kuwait-5- and Oman with sons of suitable age would be in a position to pay fees. 8. Section 5 of the report shows that Dundas has no conception of social conditions in Bahrain* Shaikhs do not become government officials or school teachers, except a very few who hold such posts as magistrates* Sons of merchants usually enter their father’s business* Sons of working class or artisan parents do not attend the town schools, only the village schools are attended by labourers and cultivators* The majority of the boys at the town schools are the sons of shopkeepers brokers and clerks, in fact the middle classes* In the same section it is stated that about 50$ of the places in the college would be reserved for Bahrainis, the full number is to be 500 there fore eventually the college will contain about 250 boys from other parts of the Gulf* I think conditions in the Gulf will have to change very radically before this number of boys paying the fees which are suggested in the report is forthcoming. 10. In section 7 it is suggested that most of the boys in the junior school would be day boys, including boys from Hedd and Muharraq. at present we find it so difficult for boys from Hedd and Muhar raq to attend the Kulliyah as day boys that those who come from there are boarders* 11. The rates of pay of English and Asiatic masters mentioned in section 13 appears to be extra vagant. I understand that English masters in Iraq start at £432* per annum rising to £480. and do notreceive houses or allowances. The figure suggested for junior teachers and instructors averages £300, per annum which is about double what the Bahrain Government is now paying to headmasters and qualified technical teachers. According to the scheme there would be 37 masters teaching 500 boys, an average of 1 master to 13i boys. The annual recurrent cost of the college is about 3 lakhs of rupees of which the Bahrain Govern ment would have to pay half. Our present normal expenditure on education in Bahrain (12 schools and several small auxiliary schools) is about It lakhs. The government would have to provide li lakhs yearly for the college in addition to all female education (4 schools) all the village schools and probably schools in Muharraq, Hedd and Manamah. The village schools, though not spectacular, are of real value both educationally and politically. The Gulf College would confer no benefits to the greater part of the population which lives in the villages outside the two big towns. In addition the government would have to pay about £17,000. for building and equipment. It is realised that a suitable building for the present Kulliyah will have to be built, but not at the cost of £38,000, 12. The fees for boarders, mentioned in section 14, are between £50 and £100. per annum. Few parents would be found in Bahrain who would be willing to pay this amount for their sons 1 education, in Bahrain. Rightly or wrongly the people of Bahrain considercl^ t** } i \ i rtr» uX*tA j*h/' J^ln^ t^ v , (r l, #t*. fU*. i t^^J , that it is the duty of the government to provide their children with free or almost free education* The practice which used to exist of charging parents for school books has now been abolished and all schools except the Kulliyah are free* It is suggested by Dundas that day boys should pay between £10. - £30* per annum. The Kulliyah boys now pay Rs* 6/- per month for 9 months. The boys at the Technical School are paid by the government Rs. 15/- per month of which they receive Rs. 10/- per month and the balance on leaving. The fees in the Kulliyah entail serious hardships on some of the parents and several boys are exempted or are paying reduced fees, because their parents can not find the money. The fees suggested by Dundas could not be obtained from Bahrain parents under present conditions. The whole question of fees was carefully considered and discussed with Shaikh Abdullah when the Kulliyah was started and the fees now being charged were considered as much as one could hope to obtain at present. The annual cost of Dundas’ scheme, if adopted would therefore be far in excess of £22,000. since the expected revenue of between £5,000. and £10,000. would not materialise. 13. The time is not yet ripe for considering scholarships from Bahrain schools to higher train ing colleges abroad. The best educated boys are now at the Kulliyah and the oldest of them are only 15. The essential pre-requisite for travelling scholarships is a sound general education which these- 8 - boys will not achieve until after another three years. 14. A charter on the lines of the one pro posed by Dundas would not meet with the approval of the Shaikhs. Education in Bahrain is now controlled by the government, the charter would remove the control of the government over the principal schools and place it in the hands of a council where the Bahrain Government would be out numbered in every vote taken on educational policy in Bahrain by eight votes to one. If the Bahrain Government provided half the funds it would require a proportional representation on the council. Such a charter, modelled on the one which was refused by Iraq, would be as unpopular in Bahrain as it was in Baghdad. 15. Dundas 1 scheme has the appearance of being a preconceived one and bears little or no relation to local conditions, local requirements and local considerations. He came to Bahrain with the scheme more or less ready made, he did not first examine the educational position in Bahrain and then work out a scheme to suit the local needs. The parts of the report which are valuable have been taken by the author from the government’s own views and from written reports by the Director of Education who first proposed a Gulf College in June 1939, but this was to be an institution which would cater for boys after they had finished at the kind of college which Dundas now envisages and would prevent them from going for higher training-9- to Iraq, Syria and other institutions abroad. The Bahrain G-overnment began to carry out its own scheme of educational reorganisation less than two years ago, it was pointed out then that full fruition could not be looked for until four or five years had elapsed. It is now suggested by Dundas, who is not I believe an expert education alist, that we should scrap the whole of our scheme and put in its place another scheme, at enormous cost, whose success or failure the author of the scheme declares to be unpredictable. 16. There is another point which is perhaps scarcelythy business as it is not the concern of the Bahrain Government. The money which the British Council spends comes direct from the British Treasury, the council has no private funds. Are we justified at a time like this in depleting the national exchequer by allowing the British Council to ask for so large a sum of money to be spent in Bahrain, which has a population of about 90,000, orta purpose which is not absolutely necessary and will not contribute directly towards winning the war.

Paragraph 2 I agree that the Bahrain Government might confine itself to improving and expanding local education in Bahrain on the lines on which they are now working. Pftr^&amp;raph g One of the Palestinian teachers was undesirable and has been dispensed with. Paragraph 8 It would be advisable to have some estimate of the number of boys from outside Bahrain who would be likely to attend the College. I could make enquiries from the Trucial Coast and Qatar as far as this Agency is concerned. But Dundas* idea was that the attendance would be low at first and grow as the College got better known. Paragraph 12 There is a very serious discrepancy in the fees suggested by Dundas and those being paid here by boys attending the Kulliyah which approximate those mentioned by you as being paid by day boys of the Stuart Memorial College, Isfahan.

Paragraph 15 Dundas’ Scheme was undoubtedly based on other such projects in Egypt f Iraq, etc*, with which he was concerned, and the idea of collecting all the schools in Manama at least into one block of buildings in suitable grounds is of course a good one* I feel however that the scheme as it stands is too ambitious and is obviously not founded on a study of local conditions* 4.

Vallance and other officials, Mr. Hutchings does not get a leave passage after two years nor is he provided with a free house, on the other hand his salary is considerably higher than Mr. Vallance’s or the initial salary of other officials. Mr. Hutchings knows that he is not being given a free house and is receiving a passage only after 4 years, his Agreement is for four years only. A Government house, or flat, will be available for him if he choses to rent it, at a reasonable rent. I believe he has his own furniture etc. He will be entitled to free medical attendance as in the case of other Government officials, I will add a clause to this effect to his Agreement.

He explained that he was committed to the Bahrain Government and could not offer himself to the Army but this was disregarded in view of his engineering qualifications and experience in technical instruction.

If this should occur, the project in Bahrain would necessarily be considerably modifi to the Secretary tof State for India I see that in the meantime the present improvements will be continued, and I am certain that the British Council would be prepared to assist in enlarging the scope of both the existing technical school and Kuliya.

WITH the approval of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Right Hon. Sir Malcolm Robertson, G.C.M.G., K.B.E., M.P., has been appointed chairman of the Council. On this appointment Sir John Chancellor resigned the position of vice- chairman, to which he had been appointed shortly after the late Lord Lloyd had become Secretary of State for the Colonies. Sir John had remained in charge of the Council s work after Lord Lloyd's death pending the appointment of a new chairman. The Executive Committee recorded its warm appreciation of the services rendered by Sir John during this period. He remains a member of the Executive Committee. Lord Snell has been appointed vice-chairman of the Council and Sir Stephen Gaselee has been nominated a member of the Executive Committee by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Sir John Power and Sir Eric Maclagan were appointed chairmen respectively of the Lectures Committee and the Fine Arts Committee. Mr. John Hampden joined the staff of the Council as director of the Books and Periodicals Department and Mrs. Fernald was appointed secretary of the Books and Periodicals Committee. Mr. J. G. Crowther has been appointed secretary of the Science Committee. 11354 [22747] B2 II.— Regional Activities. (a) Near and Middle East. Egypt. Mr. C. A. F. Dundas, the Council’s representative in the Middle East, has been in London to discuss the Council’s work in that area. In his absence Mr. R. N. Hollyer, director-general of the Delta Institutes, who has been in charge of the Cairo office, has been dealing with the problems of the many Council teachers who have been evacuated from Greece ajid the Balkans. Of these teachers, a number have joined the Imperial forces, five having been commissioned in the Royal Air Force for the purpose of teaching English to Yugoslav airmen; others have been absorbed into the Council’s institutes and two have become lecturers at the Fouad-el-Awal University, Cairo. Accordingly, only a few members of the staff in Greece and the Balkans are returning to the United Kingdom. Mr. Egerton Sykes, newly appointed books officer at Cairo, has arrived in Egypt. His work comprises the distribution of books and periodicals in the area covered by the Cairo office. Mr. F. S. Revell has been appointed films officer at Cairo and is on his way to Egypt. He will attend to the distribution of films by the Council in the same area. In view of the increased work of the Accounts Department of the Cairo office, it has been decided to appoint a deputy to Mr. Perels, the Council’s chief ^ accountant in Cairo, and Mr. C. F. Mullett will shortly be leaving England to ^ take up this appointment. Efforts are being made to obtain locally the staff required for the new British Girls’ School at Port Said. Palestine. The Council have enabled St. George’s School, Jerusalem, to appoint an additional full-time English master. The need for this appointment was great, since hitherto, out of a staff of nineteen, only four were Englishmen. The Tel-Aviv School of English continues to make satisfactory progress and there are now some 400-500 students attending it. Since the existing premises are inadequate for such numbers, an additional floor in the building now used will be acquired. The Council will bear the rent of this accommodation and the expenses of installation. Progress continues to be made at the Haifa Institute, where there are now some 200 students. Mr. and Mrs. Radley, formerly in charge of the English Preparatory School, Psychiko, are teaching in the institute at Nablus, where their qualifications and experience will be valuable. Greece. During the first fortnight in April, though work in the provinces had for a the most part come to a standstill, Council teachers continued to do useful work ^ in Athens. The activities mentioned in last quarter’s report continued up to the time of evacuation, the daily broadcast talks and lessons being described by the Athens Broadcasting Company as their most popular item. At the time of the evacuation, the matrices of a course of English gramophone lessons had just been completed, and a series of conferences initiated in response to a request from the Greek Teachers’ Training College for information about English educational methods. In addition to holding special classes, notably in hospitals and the Naval Cadet College, teachers had the novel experience of instructing British troops unable to speak English. On the 16th April, being Wednesday in the Greek Holy Week, Lord Dunsany lectured on the influence of the English Bible on English life and letters. On the same day, a meeting of the English Preparatory School Committee was held, at which it was decided that the school should endeavour to carry on its work throughout the summer. At that time there were sixty pupils at the school. On the following day the gravity of the situation became clear and it was considered advisable to begin evacuation. During the next few days, all Council and local teachers, including a number of Greeks, left for Crete and travelled thence in safety to Cairo. The Council representative remained in Athens until3 the 22nd April, to supervise evacuation and place Council property in safe keeping. He then sailed to Crete with a final party, including the president of the Anglo-Hellenic League, and, after assisting the legation in Crete for a few days, eventually reached Alexandria on the 6th May. Cyprus. Classes at the institutes in Nicosia, Kyrenia, Famagusta and Larnaea continued with success until the end of the season in May. No detailed reports of the last few months have yet been received. The deed of purchase of the new building for the Famagusta Institute was signed on the 23rd April. With the exception of Nicosia, the institutes are now closed for the vacation and the staff have left Cyprus to spend their leave in Egypt. The director of the Nicosia Institute has remained in Cyprus and the institute is continuing its club activities. The Government of Cyprus have forwarded to the Council a letter from the head of the Moslem community in Paphos, stating that many members of the community and of the local Greek population would welcome the establishment of a British institute there. Funds have been made available, and it is hoped to open this institute and that at Limassol during the autumn. Mr. G. R. Storry, the teacher appointed by the Council to the Moslem Lycee at Nicosia, arrived in Cyprus on the 20th June. Turkey. The Council representative’s collaboration with the Turkish Educational Authorities has continued to develop. In conjunction with the Board of Educa tion, the Council has met requests from the Turkish Minister of Education for copies of the board’s publications dealing with the internal organisation of the board and of local educational authorities and other documents covering all branches of education. It is intended that the Board of Education regulations should be published in Turkish by the Ministry of Education. The president of the Board of Education has written to the Turkish Minister expressing his hope for even closer collaboration between Turkey and England in the educational field through the medium of the Council. At the same time, the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture, which at present depends predominantly on German publications, has asked for the research reports and publications On agricultural education issued by the Australian Council of Agricultural Research. The Council has passed this request on to the Australian Council, and has invited the Education Departments of the other Dominion Governments and the Government of India to send to Turkey material concerning all branches of their educational systems. The Council has also supplied papers on Workmen’s Compensation for the Department of Labour of the Turkish Government. Dr. V. H. Legg’s appointment to the Chair of Industrial Chemistry at Istanbul University has been formally confirmed by the Turkish authorities. Mr. N. A. Miller, appointed through the agency of the Council as technical ^ adviser to the Turkish Government, has made close contact with the Minister of Education and the Director-General of Technical Education; he has been given an office in the Faculty of Letters and has visited most technical institutions in Ankara. The director of the Boys’ School of the Ankara Lycee is giving Mr. Miller instruction in Turkish. English classes have been formed at the Agricultural Machinery School, Ankara, the Engineering High School and the Yildiz Technical School, Istanbul, which has hitherto been a centre of German influence. Professor Hamley arrived in Ankara on the 15th April from Iraq, and undertook a tour of lectures on English studies, British education and child psychology. He has also assisted Mr. Miller in connexion with the projected technical institute, and is remaining in Turkey to co-operate in the summer course for Turkish teachers, which it is hoped to hold in July. English lessons by Council teachers in the Halkevleri have maintained their success. Of Ankara, Mr. Grant writes:— “ The classes at the Halkevi have continued and expanded greatly under the guidance of Mr. R. F. Lucas. The four principal banks, the Merkez, Is, Eti and Ziraat, are all sending considerable sections of their staff’s, and the total number of pupils is now about 250 men and women (all Turks and Moslems), and is likely to increase further.” [22747] c 24 I here are at present eleven classes, including three for children, for which premises in the neighbouring commercial school have been made available. At the Ankara Halkevi, too, a reading-room has been established and weekly lectures given by Council teachers, who also organise play-readings and excursions. In Istanbul classes are run at five Halkevleri for about 300 pupils. In the provinces I urkish teachers have been appointed to hold English classes at the Halkevleri at Canakkale and Mersin, and classes are also being arranged at Smyrna, Trebizond, Samsun and Brusa. In view of the mobilisation of teachers and the possible need of evacuation, all 1 urkish schools were closed in April for the vacation. Up to that time English classes were run with success at the Turk Maarif Lycee, Ankara, and two Lycees at Istanbul. At the former school, several improvements in policy were suggested and made by Dr. Phillips, who also ran special English classes for members of the staff. 1 he 1 urk Maarif Lycee at Brusa have asked for two teachers ol English and natural science, and books are being sent to the Lycees at Smyrna, Adana and Samsun. Classes for eighty air-cadets given bv Council teachers were started in the War Academy at the request of the Chief of Staff, Turkish Air Force, and Mr. Littler continued his course for fifty-four air officers at Robert Colle°-e Istanbul. Lessons prepared by Council teachers have been accepted for publication in Ulus, the principal organ of the Government, and in Son Posta and Yeni A sit, the chief newspapers in Anatolia and Smyrna respectively. Lessons have also been started independently in the Istanbul paper Hakikat. An English class under Mr. Lucas has been organised for the staff of Ulus and the Anatolian Press Agency. 1 he English School foi the children of employees at the Tvarabuk steel works has continued to function with the assistance of the Council. Iraq. Owing to the recent disturbances the Council’s activities in Iraq have been at a standstill, but according to the latest information received it is likely that the institute at Bagdad will shortly be reopened. A large proportion of the equipment of the institute, which was missing, has now been returned, but much is damaged. During the quarter under review Mr. T. W. Morray, director of the institute in Bagdad, has been on leave in Iran and Afghanistan, and at the same time has been investigating the possibility of extending the Council’s work in tkase two countries. A den. Dm mg Colonel Lake s absence on sick leave m India, MT. II. E. Warrington the English master sent out by the Council to the Aden Secondary School? has been dealing with Council business. To enable the plans for the foundation of an institute in Aden to go forward, the Council appointed Mr. Madsen as lecturer in Aden. The preliminary steps are being taken to open a club at Lahej, a town of some importance on the road from Aden to the Yemen and the seat of the Premier Chief of Aden Protectorate. Owing to the lack of available buildings the Council will construct its own accommodation for the club. (b) The Balkans and Malta. Yugoslavia. The evacuation of British teachers began early in April All Council staff and local teachers eventually left the country 'safely,' with the regrettable exception of Mr. G. E. L. Thomas, Director of Studies'at the English Reading Room, Zagreb. Mr. Thomas was apparently ordered back to Zagreb from the coast, with consular officials, who included the former consul-general in Zagreb and 18 now believed to be m Germany. The majority of the other teachers proceeded to Cairo via Athens, but Mr. Shillan, the Director of the Beh&gt; T ade Institute, and se\en others who remained behind joined the Legation party with whom they travelled through Italy, finally reaching Madrid safely Mr Shilhn lias since been appointed Assistant Director of the British Institute at Lisbon.The Council’s work appears to have continued without interruption until the moment of evacuation and satisfactory reports have been received of the final months in Belgrade, Ljubljana and Split. The first annual general assembly of the Yugoslav-British Institute, Belgrade, held on the 31st March, marked the conclusion of the first half of the institute’s first full season. The director’s report showed that its development had exceeded all expectation, the number of students enrolled being 1,000, of whom nearly 700 were in regular attendance. The director was assisted in the English courses by two Council teachers, six local British teachers and six Yugoslav teachers. Malta. The damage caused to the institute in Valletta by bombs at the end of February was still under repair in April, but did not interfere with the institute’s regular programme. During that month, nine fixtures were held and there were the same number in May. These included 7 lectures, 5 concerts, 2 debates, 2 play-readings and 2 dances. Though many members were necessarily kept away by raids, the attendance at these engagements was satisfactory. At the end of May, membership totalled 1,095, representing an increase of about 100 over the total enrolled at the end of 1939-40. The season came to an end on the 19th June. The director’s annual report shows that, during the past year, the institute has played a vital part in the cultural life of the island. At one point membership had grown to nearly 2,000, a figure greatly in excess of any expectation at the time of the institute’s foundation. Though difficulties of accommodation have made it necessary to reduce the number of boarders at St. Edward’s College, the school has completed its term without any serious diminution of numbers. (c) Rest of Europe. Spain. In spite of a slight falling off in the number of students at the beginning of the term (partly due to a reluctance to enrol for the short summer term and partly to the political situation), the classes at the institute in Madrid have been very well attended. A new lecturer has been appointed and will take up his duties immediately, as it has been decided to keep the institute open during the summer months to preserve the position it now enjoys. A number of lectures have been given, among which that of the American Ambassador, Mr. Alexander Wendell, was particularly popular. Foreign representatives from South America, Portugal and the Allied Governments were present as well as Spanish academicians and other distinguished Spaniards. The children’s school is carrying on well and there have been many pleasing reports from grateful parents. Full afternoon school has now been started and the curriculum somewhat broadened. Portugal. From the 11th June to the 23rd June Professor Ifor Evans, the Council’s Educational Director, inspected the work of the Council in Portugal, visiting Lisbon, Coimbra and Oporto. Two new lecturers, previously employed by the Council in Italy, have been appointed to the institute in Lisbon—Messrs. Lloyd and Graham. The numbers attending the Casa da Inglaterra at Coimbra have increased to such an extent that additional premises are being sought. Mr. Webster, who was appointed to assist Mr. Hawkins in the Sala Inglesa at the University of Oporto, has taken up his duties. The visit of the Oxford delegation to confer a degree on Dr. Salazar was most successful. A detailed report of this visit will be found under the heading of Lectures. Iceland. Further reports received from Mr. Cyril Jackson, the Council’s repre sentative in Iceland, show that the lectures and English classes which he has arranged are proceeding satisfactorily and with increasing attendances. During the past quarter there have been 22 lectures and 24 English classes each month. [22747] c*6 r' Articles have been contributed regularly to the Icelandic press and Mr. Jackson recently gave a talk on British broadcasting over the Icelandic broadcasting system. A party of five Icelandic journalists was invited to visit this country as guests of the Council and arrived here on the 28th June, accompanied by Mr. Jackson. Finland. The assistant teachers’ scheme, under which English was being taught in various Finnish schools throughout the country, proved highly successful and aroused considerable interest among Finnish students and school children. The end-of-term party and prize-giving arranged in April was attended by nearly three times as many children as had been expected. A summer school for English teachers in Finland was organised by the Council in Lohja for the months of June, July and August According to the earlier reports the initial response was excellent. Sweden. A grant has been authorised to defray the advertising expenses of an English summer course being arranged in Stockholm by university students, under the auspices of the Council. 1 he arrangements for the summer school at Sigtuna, commencing on the 27th June, ^have been completed. A prospectus was forwarded to teachers throughout Sweden, and by the beginning of May some seventy enquiries had been received. It is expected that some 120 teachers and students will participate. Mr. Cedric Hentschel, the newly-appointed lecturer in English at Uppsala University, reached Sweden in June. This appointment was made possible by the Council’s assistance. (d) Ibero-America. A rgentina. Mr. C. W. Yates has arrived at Rosario, and reports that there are good prospects of shortly forming a committee for the society which it is hoped to open there. For the time being Mr. Yates is expanding the adult evening classes in English at the English school. The Argentine Association of British Culture, Cordoba, reported that eighty members had joined soon after the opening. This was before the beginning of the academic year in March. A further presentation of books has been made to the library. At the suggestion of the Argentine Embassy, London, the Council have arranged an Exhibition of Graphic Art at Buenos Aires, which is more fully described under the heading of Fine Arts. Brazil. Mr. Francis Toye, Mr. J. E. A. Jolliffe and Mr. C. H. Hindley have arrived in Brazil to take up their appointments as director and lecturer at the Anglo- Brazilian Cultural Society, Rio de Janeiro, and director of the Anglo-Brazilian Cultural Society, Bello Horizonte. There are now 900 students and 800 members at the Rio Society, and there is a long waiting list of students. The society are searching for larger premises. At the reception for the mannequins of the English Fashion Mission in South America the premises of the society were filled. The Sao Paulo Society now has a student matriculation of 1,900. Mr. Hindley has reported very favourably on the premises of the new society in Bello Horizonte and its prospects of success. Classes were started with an opening matriculation of eighty students. The experimental teaching centres at Copacabanca and Nictheroy are justifying themselves. There are four classes at Copacabanca and a steady enrolment of students at Nictheroy. Three scholarships to the United Kingdom have been offered and excellent candidates have applied.Chile. The Book Exhibition was held at the Museo de Bellas Artes, Santiago, from the 8th April to the 4th May, 1941. The inauguration was attended by the Minister of Education, the new Chilean Ambassador in London (don Manuel Bianchi), the Minister of Defence (now again Rector of the University of Chile), the Director-General of Museums, His Majesty’s Ambassador, a number of other important personalities and members of the British community. Some 2,100 persons attended the exhibition, and it was established from several sources that the exhibition was better attended than the French (books) and German (reproductions of Diirer, &amp;e.) exhibitions of last year. In view of the interest aroused by the exhibition, arrangements have been made for the presentation of technical books to various Chilean institutions. Mrs. E. V. Peyton has been appointed headmistress of St. Margaret’s Girls School, Valparaiso, and will shortly be leaving this country for Chile. Miss Edna Durrell was unable to take up her appointment as assistant mistress at the British School, Antofagasta, and the Council is now endeavouring to select a mistress in her place. Silver cups have been presented to the Chilean army, navy and air force as football trophies, and laboratory equipment has been presented on a comprehensive scale to three of the British schools in Chile. Classes of English in workmen’s clubs have been formed at Santiago, Talcahuano and near Antofagasta, and it is hoped that many others will be formed. Scholarships to this country have been granted to Dr. O. Poblete, physician- surgeon of the University of Chile and chief surgeon of the Asistencia Publica, and to Dr. A. Gallinato, chief of Industrial Hygiene at the Public Health Ministry of Chile. There are now 1,000 students and members at the Santiago Institute, 313 at the Valparaiso Institute, 370 at the University English Academy, Santiago, and 100 at the Centro Anglo-Chileno, Santiago. Colombia. There are now 396 students at the Colombian-British Institute, Medellin, and forty students were reported soon after the opening at the Colombian-British Institute, Cali. Supplementary grants have been made for all four of the provincial institutes to provide additional furniture and equipment. Mr. George Sutherland has resigned from his position as Council representa tive in Colombia and director of the' Colombian-British Institute, Bogota. Mr. W. Tidman has been appointed acting director of the Bogota Institute and Mr. P. H. G. Gibbs is acting as full-time teacher there instead of at the Cali Institute. Peru. There are now 238 students and members of the British-Peruvian Cultural Association. A 16-mm. sound projector and screen has been presented to the association. Two scholarships to this country have been offered and applications have been received. Salvador. The charge d’affaires, on behalf of the Council, presented an Arden edition of the works of Shakespeare to the Rector of the University, San Salvador, at the British Legation on the 24th May. Amongst the fifty persons present were the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, the Under-Secretary for Public Instruc tion. representing the President, all the Deans of the Faculties of the University, representatives of the local press and leading members of the British community. The rector asked that his gratitude should be expressed to the Council and voiced his admiration for the great English philosophers and men of letters, stating that his countrymen had a special sympathy for the England of to-day in her struggle in the defence of liberty. [22747] c* 2i hi ^ n dc r-Sec re ta ry for Public Instruction was particularly courteous in nis reterences to Great Britain. ,•« n fchis P resentati on in the local press were excellent, and there ns no doubt that it was widely appreciated in Salvadorian circles.

I he Book I H ,xport Scheme has developed extensively in the course of the past quarter. Much larger orders are now being received than previously seemed rkely and, since the last report, the Scheme has begun to operate also in Portugal and Pgypt. Very satisfactory arrangements are being made in Lisbon. Other negotiations at present taking place affect a bookseller in Lima, who wishes to operate the Scheme on a considerable scale. Brochures. I he eleven illustrated brochures on British Life and Thought have all been reprinted separately at Is. each and are now ready for publication also as a bound voiume with this title, containing ninety-five pages of photographs, a large map of the British Commonwealth and a full index. This volume will be published by Longmans in July or September at 8s. 6d. net. Liberty: Principles and Practice, by Viscount Samuel (Longmans, 6d. net), has also been reprinted. British Contributions to Arabic Studies, by Bernard Lewis, with a preface by A. J. Arberry, is nearly ready for publication by Longmans at Is. net. This illustrated brochure is the first complete survey of its subject. A brochure on British Trade Unions is in preparation. There are insistent requests from the many foreigners now in this country for books in their own languages on Britain, the Commonwealth and the British way of life. To meet this need a series of illustrated pamphlets and booklets in six languages is being prepared as rapidly as possible, and it is hoped that these will prove very useful also in foreign countries. Book Review Scheme. The Book Review Scheme is now operating successfully in all South American countries, except Bolivia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Venezuela, where the local press offers no facilities. It is now operating also in the Middle East, in Japan, in those European countries to which books can still be sent and in Malta. To the last-named books are sent in duplicate to enable the Institute Library to retain copies of some of the latest publications. Book Exhibitions. The text-book exhibition, which was to have been sent to Chile last autumn, was unfortunately delayed at the docks in this country owing to enemv action, and has only recently reached Santiago, too late for the occasion for which it was intended. The books, however, are being stored in Santiago for the present, and are to be exhibited twice—once to Chilean teachers at the end of the school’year and again to the teachers at British Schools in Chile on the occasion of their Summer Vacation Course, which will be held at the University of Santiago next January. A large exhibition of text-books for Colombia is at present being assembled. Translations in Sweden. English books have long been very popular in Sweden in both the original editions and in translations and are still in great demand. The Council, with the assistance of the Ministry of Information, has been transmitting to Swedish publishers, through the press attache at Stockholm, any books which they wished to consider for translation. Books for Resident Foreigners. The general distribution of books for resident foreigners has continued. A library has been supplied to the new Polish House in Edinburgh, many of the books being generously supplied by a Scottish publisher at low cost. ’ W. //. Hudson Centenary. The centenary of W. H. Hudson’s birth falls this August. A special anthology of essays on the writings of this author will be published in Buenos Aires. The Council has contributed to this anthology articles by six leading British authors, which have been specially written for the occasion/ [22747] D *10 'J British Book News. I he circulation of the monthly book list, the select annotated list of recent hooks issued for the Council by the National Book Council, is now nearly 10,000. It has been improved in various details, renamed British Book News, and given a new cover. It increases steadily in value as a means of publicity for the best books on all subjects published in Great Britain and it is sent free to any applicant living outside the British Empire. A complete index to the monthly lists issued during 1940 has been printed and distributed. The English Classics. I his valuable book list has been issued by the National Book Council at the expense of tlm Council and the publishers concerned. It is a complete combined catalogue of Everyman s Library, Collins Classics, Nelson Classics and Worlds Classics, edited and annotated by F. Seymour Smith, F.L.A., and comprises nearly all that is best in English literature of the past, with many books by, modern authors. The Council is distributing 15,000 copies. n A number of other National Book Council Lists have been sponsored by the Council, including, one on Holland which is the first of a series dealing with all the Allied countries and intended mainly for resident foreigners. Periodicals. New subscriptions for newspapers and periodicals abroad during the quarter LOLcll « 5 Oo^. It will be remembered that the Council has taken over the distribution of penodicals to certain institutions in the Colonies. Letters of appreciation from sc ools native libraries and clubs are reaching the Council from all parts of the a) onia Empire. I he Director of Education in Basutoland, for instance, foresees vatuabie results from the Council’s action and the following comments from the headmaster of Basutoland High School, Maseru, may be taken as typical of the Colonies Sm ^ 1 whlcil En ^ llsh newspapers and magazines are greeted in r ,J\ The P eri 5 )d 1 icals are thoroughly enjoyed by the students and, in fact, I t hink many of the papers are surreptitiously slipped out of the library and forwarded to their parents and friends, among whom, I hope, they continue to do good work in disseminating British aims and ideals.” The Free French Headquarters have welcomed the co-operation of the Council in sending material to French Equa'tqrial Africa. As a beginning periodicals are now being sent to two centres in Brazzaville, (1) for the staff mostly English-speaking) and students of the college recently opened in that •* •*- * « The proposed distribution of Dominion periodicals, referred to in the last report has been well received in Latin-America, the Near East and Spain I he number of newspapers and periodicals supplied to the Allied forces merchant seamen and resident foreigners continue to increase ’ (b) Britain To-day. I he circulation of Britain To-day in Europe has been further curtailed by the enemy occupation of Yugoslavia and Greece. Some copies in English still go o European countries difficult of access, such as Switzerland and Sweden, and have been arriving, though late, at their destinations. In Portugal where the circu ation has for some time been large, continued proofs of appreciation are afforded by articles reprinted from Britain To-day in the Portuguese press newspaper comments and the volume of correspondence received daily by the director of the British Institute in Lisbon. J A non* 1 - 6 mcrease the tot : a ]. circulation in all countries to a figure now exceedino- 80 000 is mainly accounted for by the additional copies asked for by the British Libraiy of Information m Ivew Lork, which has accepted responsibility for the whole distribution of {Sritain To-day in the United States. A long article was reprinted in full in the Baltimore Sun, another in a college literary magazine*and others have been used by the Public Administration Service in Chicago. Translations of many articles have been republished in whole or in part in Polish weeklies circulating in the United States and Canada. Increased distribution of the Spanish and Portuguese editions in Latin- America is being promoted through various agencies on the spot. A steady stream of requests for copies arrives from individuals in the Latin-American countries, and letters have been received from the heads of big businesses asking for copies to distribute among their staffs. Offers to buy the journal have been received from various countries. A large proportion of the increased distribution, outside the United States, arises from personal applications for copies of Britain To-day. Notable evidence of usefulness is afforded by the numerous requests for back numbers, many of which it is impossible to satisfy. (c) Drama. At the request of the management the texts of the following plays recently produced in London have been sent to the Royal Theatre in Stockholm for consideration with a view to their translation and performance next season :— “ Follow my Leader,” Terence Rattigan and Anthony Merrill. “ The Light of Heart,” Emlyn Williams. “ The Golden Cuckoo,” Denis Johnston. “ Thunder Rock,” Robert Ardrey. ” In Good King Charles’ Golden Days,” G. Bernard Shaw. “ The Corn is Green,” Emlyn Williams. “ Rebecca,” Daphne du Maurier. “ Ladies in Retirement,” Edward Percy and Reginald Denham. “A House in the Square,” Diana Morgan. “ Jeannie,” Aimee Stuart. “ Music at Night,” J. B. Priestley. Design for a stage have been sent to the institute at Valletta. The Council is represented on the International Advisory Council of the Entertainments National Service Association, which has been formed with a view to the entertainment of the Allied forces by foreign artists now resident in Britain. The practice continues of sending British plays to play-reading societies and dramatic clubs in Europe and Ibero-America. (d) Films. New Production. (i) Newsreels. During the quarter under review British News (the composite newsreel specially compiled from the ten issues produced weekly by the five British newsreel companies) was made up each week with the co-operation of the Colonial Office and the Empire Division of the Ministry of Information and was distributed regularly as follows :— 35-mm. copies.

The Peo'plEs Land (Colour).—The work of the National Trust. (b) Industrial. In co-operation with the Board of Trade and various export groups, the following additional films are now in production :— Song of the Clyde. —The story of the River Clyde. Border Weave (Colour).—The woollen industry. I he Western Isles (Colour).—Harris tweed industry. Educational.—It has been decided to produce, with the co-operation of the British Film Institute, a number of purely educational films for distribution to Departments of Education in the Dominions, Colonies and foreign countries and to British institutes abroad. In recommending this proposal the Film Committee of the Council had in mmd that, whde the standard of British educational films was the highest in the woild, then* production by commercial companies had been suspended at a time when Departments of Education in neutral countries were being flooded with educational films made in Germany. The recommendation was made after consultation with the Council’s Committees on English Teaching and Science. ' . . • e p rs f series planned comprises films on biology, human-geographv physics, history-geography. ' J Distribution A broad. , ur n g. tlie quarter 808 prints of Council films were despatched to seventy- one temtorics Eighteen dupe negatives have been sent to the Department of formation, Australia, for commercial and non-theatrical distribution Three dupe negatives have been sent to the United States.

New Zealand. Council films have been shown non-theatrically to fifteen military units, twenty-three associations and clubs, thirteen schools and colleges, twelve hospitals and five miscellaneous organisations under a scheme organised by the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom Northern Rhodesia.—The information officer, expressing his apprecia tion of the Council’s films, said : “ All the films are quite excellent and are very highly appreciated both by Europeans and Africans'. Many people come to the cinema to see your 6ms and ‘ British News ’ and then go home without waiting for the feature picture.” gDistribution in the United Kingdom. Arrangements have been made with Associated British Film Distributors, General bilm Distributors and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for the distribution on a favourable renting basis of ten of the Council’s films. The two last-mentioned firms, in addition to two other large American distributors, have asked to see other films produced for the Council. Film Shows. In co-operation with the Board of Trade, a display of the Council’s films dealing with industry was given on the 21st April to various export groups interested in the use of films. Representatives of the press and film critics were also present. On the 12th June The Times gave a display of the Council’s films to advertising agents whose clients use its columns. Among the films shown was Morning Taper, a film sponsored by the Council from material provided by The Times. Members of Parliament, the Diplomatic Corps, representatives of Allied Governments in this country and other distinguished guests were invited to a show of the Council’s films on the 17th June at the New Gallery Cinema, Regent Street. Over 700 people were present. On the 19th June a show of films was given to the 1940 Council, includinG- members of the Parliamentary Reconstruction Group, and the Royal Institute of British Architects. “ Films of Britain.” A new illustrated catalogue of the Council’s films, with an introduction by Mr. Philip Guedalla, is now being distributed overseas. National Film Library. Copies of all the Council’s films are being deposited with the National Film Library for record and preservation purposes. (e) Fine Arts. Chairman, Fine Arts. Sir Eric Maclagan, director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, has, with the concurrence of the Board of Education, accepted the invitation to become chairman of the Fine Arts Committee and (ex officio) chairman of its sub committees. Coat of Arms. The College of Arms having granted Arms and Supporters to the British Council, Mr. Stephen Gooden, A.R.A., whose Royal Arms for the library at Windsor Castle are well known, has been commissioned to engrave the plate for the Council’s use. The device is as follows :— Coat of Arms. —Or, on a pale gules, a lion’s face of the first. A chief sable thereon, an open book proper edged gold. Crest. —Issuant from an antique crown or, a cubit arm vested azure cuffed argent, the hand proper grasping a torch gold inflamed, also proper. Supporters. —On either side a lion reguardant or, gorged with an antique crown azure. San Francisco Exhibit. This exhibition has now completed its tour. Mr. Blake-More Godwin, president of the United States Museum Directors’ Association, reports that it has successfully visited Kansas City; Providence, Rhode Island; New Haven, Connecticut; and Akron and Youngstown, Ohio, in addition to the centres mentioned in the last report. The collection will be housed at the Toledo Art Gallery until the autumn.♦J 14 Exhibitions of Children?s Drawings. These two exhibits consisting of approximately 200 framed works each, have now been despatched to Rio de Janeiro and to Ottawa. A third collection is being held in reserve in case of accident. The educational authorities at Savannah, Georgia, have applied for yet another exhibition of such drawings. In the selection of this third exhibition the appropriate committee will have the assistance of Mr. Herbert Read and (as regards the Scottish exhibits) Mr. Stanley Cursiter, director of the National Galleries of Scotland. The Arts and Crafts Exhibition. Preparations for this exhibition are reaching an advanced stage. Difficulty has been experienced in obtaining certain desirable exhibits, since many craftsmen have been called away on war work. The British Library of Information at New York have written offering to co-operate with the Council in any way possible to make the exhibition a success. The present plan is to exhibit the crafts in a series of six rooms, three typical of town and three of country life. The exhibit would he shown in five centres in the United States and afterwards he circulated in Canada. !r I ■ 1 Graphic A rts for South A merica. The Argentine Embassy in London having suggested an exhibit of graphic art in Buenos Aires, the Council, with the valuable advice of Mr. Campbell Dodgson, has just completed the selection of an exhibit of 230 works for this purpose, divided into engravings, etchings, aquatints, mezzotints, wood engravings, wood cuts, lithographs and colour prints. The period covered by this collection is from Sir Seymour Haden (1818-1910) to the present day. A Spanish-English catalogue is being prepared. Graphic Art for Madrid. A somewhat similar, though slightly smaller, collection has been brought together for an exhibition in the institute at Madrid. This is now ready for despatch. Exhibition of Colour Prints for Lima. In response to several requests for exhibitions of contemporary lithographs and other colour prints, a compact exhibition has been framed and despatched to Lima, with a small catalogue in Spanish. Requests have since been received for it to be circulated throughout South America. The Wakefield Collection. Works by the following artists have been purchased for the Council’s permanent collection since the 1st January last:— Blampied, Birkbeck, Dobson, Augustus John (three drawings), Lord Methuen, Rodney Burn, Eric Daglish, A. Dallas, La Dell, Detmold, F. L. Griggs, R.A., Dame Laura Knight, R.A., A. Henderson, J. A. Grant, Murray Tod, and the late Joseph Simpson—nineteen in all. This brings the number of works in this collection to 281. New York World's Fair Exhibit on Tour. Press cuttings in regard to the extensive tour of this important collection continue to come in; particularly favourable are those from Canada. On the completion of the exhibition in Toronto the authorities of the museum and art gallery wrote asking whether they might purchase the important picture by the late J. D. Innes “ Afternoon, Ronda,” which had been lent by Sir Michael Sadler. As this picture was insured for £500 the Council approached the owner with some diffidence. The gratifying reply was to the effect that Sir Michael Sadler had so many happy and grateful memories of his visit in that city that he ventured to offer the picture, through the British Council, as a gift to the Toronto Art Gallery. *(f) Lectures. Reports are now available of the lectures given by the delegation from the University of Oxford in Portugal and by Mr. Hugh Ruttledge in the West Indies. It will be recollected that the delegation from the university visited Portugal to confer the degree of Doctor of Civil Law on his Excellency Dr. Antonio de Oliveira Salazar. The delegation consisted of the president of Trinity College, Mr. J. R. H. Weaver (representing the Vice-Chancellor), the Public Orator (Mr. T. F. Higham) and Professor W. J. Entwistle. The Council bore the greater part of the cost of the visit (save that borne by the Portuguese Govern ment) and made all the arrangements. The delegation proceeded to Portugal, and by invitation of the University of Coimbra a convocation was held there in order to confer the degree. The Rector of Coimbra presided. Dr. Salazar was presented by the Public Orator in a formal Latin oration, the degree was conferred by Mr. Weaver and Dr. Salazar made reply in a Latin speech. The delegation were subsequently the guests of the rector at a luncheon where Dr. Salazar was present. In the afternoon, Professor Entwistle gave a public lecture in Portuguese, which Dr. Salazar attended. It is believed that Dr. Salazar’s attendance was a compliment which had not previously been paid to a foreign lecturer. The members of the delegation were invited in turn to address the three universities of Lisbon, Oporto and Coimbra. They were also received privately and entertained to dinner by Dr. Salazar. On the latter occasion His Majesty’s Ambassador, the Portuguese Minister of Education and representatives of the three universities were present. The dinner party was followed by a reception attended by representatives of every aspect of Portuguese culture. On this occasion the gardens of the San Bento Palace were illuminated for the first time since Dr. Salazar had taken up residence there. The delegates were also entertained by the Cardinal Patriarch of Lisbon and by His Majesty’s Ambassador. Their expenses in Portugal were defrayed by the Portuguese Government. Most satisfactory publicity was given to the visit by the Portuguese press, where the movements of the delegation figured consistently as front-page news. Mr. Ruttledge delivered 3i lectures and broadcasts in the West Indies, British Guiana, British Honduras and Bermuda. His audiences were of many different kinds, both white and coloured, and ranging in number from 27 to 800. On a number of occasions he was introduced by the Governors of the respective Colonies. His visit was very successful and he brought back much useful information in regard to the possibility of work by the Council in the West Indies. (g) Music. The consignments of music and records sent to Spain and music to Malta in the last quarter were both lost owing to enemy action and are being replaced. The music sent out to Athens was intercepted at Cairo when Greece fell into enemy hands, and is now being used in Egypt. A small quantity of orchestral works, together with several hundred copies of part songs, were sent to the English School in Cairo. A further selection of orchestral material has been sent to Palestine for the Palestine orchestra; fifty song-books were sent to the institute in Jaffa for distribution there and in Tel Aviv. In May the Council hired the orchestral material of Ireland’s Piano Concerto for a concert in October in Gbteborg. A foundation library of music was sent to the British Library of Information and Culture at Tokyo, and several choral works have been sent to the embassy in Chile, with further sets of the military band music which was sent out during the last quarter and proved very popular. Work among the resident foreigners’ centres has increased : the song-books and radio originally sent to the British Council House in Liverpool were lost owing to enemy action and have been replaced; music of various kinds has been presented to a Netherlands band, a Gibraltarian centre, a Polish women’s club, a Czechoslovak centre and a Danish hostel. Gramophone records have been lent or presented to a large number of centres, and gramophones or pianos have been presented to others. Concerts, with artists including Mabel Ritchie, Winifred Radford, Geoffrey Dunn, Roy Henderson, Eda Kersey, Cyril Smith, Maurice Cole, Denis Mathews16 and Frederick Grinke, the London Madrigal Group, Antonia Butler and Kathleen Markwell and the Menges String Quartet, have been given to various refugee centres, as follows : Five at the Polish Hearth, one at the Czechoslovak Institute, two at another Czechoslovak centre, two at the Danish Hostel and three for Norwegian Seamen in London. Distribution of Pi'ess Material. The Council has continued its regular output of the “London” Letter, feature articles, photographs and stereos, in addition to matter specially commissioned by contacts abroad. Distribution details for the quarter are as follows :— All articles and London Letters susceptible of illustration are accompanied by photographs. The number of different photographs in the Council’s library, to which additions are made daily, was 33,220 on the 30th June. The service of stereos for direct printing is now bringing a gratifying response from contacts abroad, particularly since blocks have been improved by the addition of a special adhesive which saves the printer’s time in the mounting process. Distribution figures for the quarter are as follows The following are among appreciative articles on the work of the Council which have appeared in the press during the quarter :— April 29.— Star: “ They had a Hand in History.” June 13.— Star: “ The British Council seeks the World’s Ear.” June 14.— Manchester Guardian: “ The British Council.” June 14.— Birmingham Post: “ The British Council.” June 13.— Railway Review: “ Telling the World.” June 19.— The Schoolmaster: “ The British Council.” June 21.— West Africa: “ Work for the British Council.” June 24.— Carlisle Journal: “ British Council—Its Work for Education.” June 27.— Free Euroye: “ The British Council.” Mr. E. D. O'Brien has continued to address service units on the work of the Council. A ssistance to Foreign Journalists. At the suggestion of the president of the Foreign Press Association and at the request of the Ministry of Information, forty members of the association, headed by the new president, Dr. Gottfried Keller, were entertained for a week end at Harrogate. 1 his week-end was of much value in drawing the attention of new members of the association to the facilities offered by the Council and in cementing the existing good relations between the Council and the association.

Bomber and I ighter Stations and various Commands of the army) was arranged by the Council. n (i) Science. The Science Committee held its first meeting on the 2nd May. Sir William Biagg has accepted the Chairmanship of the Committee as a whole ajid Dr. C. F. A. Pantin, Fellow and Lecturer of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Reader in Invertebrate Zoology in the I niversity, has been invited to join the Committee and has accepted. Mr. J. G. Crowther has been appointed Secretary. He is the Scientific Correspondent of the Manchester Guardian and author of many books on general science, including British Scientists of the Nineteenth Century. The Committee decided to work in three Panels, for Pure Science, Medicine and Engineering. Sir William Bragg has accepted the Chairmanship of the Pure Science Panel, Sir Edward Mellanby of the Medicine Panel and Sir William Larke of the Engineering Panel. # The Committee has recommended certain scientific and technical books to lie presented to institutions in Argentina. It has also recommended the publication of an illustrated brochure on British Engineering Achievement. This proposal was supported by the Engineering Panel at its first meeting on the 15th May. The brochure is being prepared. At its second meeting held on the 13th June, the Engineering Panel recommended that two or more short biographies of great British engineers should be published. Negotiations for one of these have^been started. (j) Students. As the grant of scholarships to male students from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa has been suspended temporarily, it has been decided to invite to this country four women graduates of Dominion Universities who would observe war-time conditions in their particular field of research, i.e., in education, economics, public health, social service or medicine. An invitation has been addressed to the Turkish Ministry of Education to send a Turkish educationist to this country for the purpose of studying the British educational system and of lecturing on Turkish life and civilisation. A candidate18 for this mission has already been proposed by the Turkish Ministry, the arrange ments are being made in co-operation with the London School of Oriental Studies. Eight applications have already been received from South American countries in response to invitations to study at Universities in the United Kingdom. Two post-graduate scholarships and three grants-in-aid to commercial students have been allocated to students from Iceland for the year 1941-42. The problem of the conditions of life of foreign students in this country in war-time, and particularly of students from Near Eastern countries, has been given special consideration during the period under review, and a plan of enter tainment, hospitality and educational advice is being elaborated. The Council has arranged, with the collaboration of the Board of Extra-Mural Studies, for a Vacation Course at Cambridge in the English language and British life and civilisation from the 16th July to the 6th August. Students from 23 different countries will attend. There will be approximately fifty students who are, or have been, studying in this country under the auspices of the Council; there will be also some fifty representatives of Allied or German- occupied territories. The following Council students have obtained employment during the period under review :— * Mr. Dancheff (Bulgaria), part time work at B.B.C. Miss Rantavaara (Finland), employed at B.B.C. Mr. Capernaros (Greece), employed at B.B.C. Mr. Polychroniades (Greece), employed at B.B.C. ^ Mr. Raptopoulos (Greece), employed on one of Mr. Lloyd George’s v farms.

The Council continued, in suitable cases, to offer assistance to enable students of the Allied nationalities to undertake academic or similar work in the United Kingdom. Reports concerning the two Afghan Police students who have been training with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have been so satisfactory that His Excellency the Afghan Minister has agreed to their continuing their studies for a further 1 period in order to take practical training. (k) Teaching. Following the announcement in the last Quarterly Report that courses for ^ certain teachers of English would be arranged with the School of Oriental Studies, ^ the Council’s appointee to the Assistant Directorship of the Anglo-Uruguayan Institute in Montevideo took such a course for a month before proceeding to Uruguay. A course of four lectures on the various problems arising in the teaching of English to foreigners was also arranged at the School of Oriental Studies for sixteen of the teachers who are giving lessons to civilian refugees in the London area. The following overseas appointments have been made during the quarter :— Europe. Portugal. Lecturer in Statistics at the University of Coimbra (Mr W. L. Stevens). Spain.

One set of all the lantern lectures has been sent to the British Library of Information and Culture at Tokyo for general use in schools in Japan. Maps have been sent to individuals in Argentina and Brazil, and records of poetry and speeches to Cairo for use in various schools, and to the Department of Education in Batavia. Presentations of national flags, maps, posters and games of every description have been made on an increasing scale to the various Resident Foreigners’ Centres in this country. Linguaphone conversational courses have been presented to various centres, and further sets sent to the British Council House in Liverpool to replace those lost owing to enemy action. Lantern slides have been lent at various times for lectures to the centres, while slides and the Council’s epidiascope are in constant use at the various Gibraltarian centres in London. IV.— Resident Foreigners. ^ Regional Officers. Mr. Ernest Burbridge has been appointed Assistant Regional Officer for the English Midlands and Mid-Wales. Allied Air Units. The Council continued to work in close collaboration with the Air Ministry on the problem of educational facilities for Allied airmen. This collaboration has now been extended to cover not only the teaching of English and the supply of literature, but the provision of films and other facilities available through the Council. Allied Armies. At the request of the Director of Army Education and the Department of the Inspector-General of Allied Contingents, the Council has been making a survey of the educational and cultural needs of the Belgian Army, the Czechoslovak Brigade, the Free French Forces, the Netherlands Brigade, the Norwegian Army and the Polish Army. Reports resulting from these surveys are now being submitted to the War Office, and it is hoped that in the future the Council may be able to give more assistance to Allied nationals in the Allied Armies.20 Internees. At the request of the Home Office, the Council continued to send lecturers to the Isle of Man to lecture. In the last three months the following lecturers have visited the Island :— Mr. Stanley Wormald : “British Education.” Professor F. G. Tryhorn : “ British Science.” Mr. Sidney Wicks: “English Literature” and “The English Tradition.” Mr. G. G. Thomson: “The British Social Services.” The Council has also been asked to provide, at the expense of the Home Office, various facilities to centres in the London and Northern areas. A dmiralty. The Admiralty have recently asked the Council to appoint three teachers of English to be attached to Allied naval units in ports in the United Kingdom. The Admiralty have also circulated to port amenities liaison officers details of the type of facility that can be obtained from the Council for Allied naval personnel, the cost being met by the Admiralty. Civilian Refugees and Allied and Neutral Merchant Seumen. 1. Teaching of English. The Council recently agreed that non-British nationals receiving tuition in English from British Council teachers should be encouraged to take the Cambridge Certificate of Proficiency in English organised by the Local Examinations Syndicate in Cambridge. The syndicate have agreed to arrange special examina tions for British Council entrants and to reduce by half the fees for the examina tion when taken by Allied service men and merchant seamen. During the last quarter the following teachers of English have been appointed :— London and Home Counties (civilians) : 6 teachers (all part-time). Scotland (civilians) : 6 teachers. South-West England (civilians and merchant seamen) : 1 teacher-organiser; (civilians) : 2 teachers. 2. Film Shows. Since the last report the following film shows have been arranged :— London and East Anglia — Merchant seamen ... ... ... ... ... ... 6 Civilians ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 37(‘) South-West England and South Wales — Merchant seamen ... ... ... ... ... ... 11 Civilians ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 Northern — Merchant seamen ... ... ... ... ... ... 0 Civilians ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 6 Scotland — Merchant seamen ... ... ... ... ... ... 9 Civilians ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 10 3. Books and Periodicals. A number of the Council’s pamphlets on “ British Life and Thought ” are to be translated into Allied languages. In addition, a pamphlet of a simpler nature entitled “See Britain,” by Guy Ramsey, has been translated into all Allied languages and is designed particularly for Allied merchant seamen and men serving with the forces. All over the country there is an unceasing demand for educational books and books about Britain from non-British nationals of every category. ( l ) Including Gibraltarian centres.Lectures. 4 ^ ^as been possible, particularly in London, to arrange some lectures on British Life and Institutions in national centres and hostels. As the knowledge of English among non-British nationals in this country increases, the need for such lectures becomes increasingly important. Art Exhibitions and Concerts. (a) Allied Art Exhibition. —On the 30th May the Secretary of State for Scotland opened an Allied Art Exhibition organised by the Council in the National Gallery of Scotland with the generous permission of the director and trustees of the gallery. About 500 people attended the exhibition on the opening day, including representatives of the Allied Governments. The exhibition, which is representative of all the Allies, is of a high standard and has already been visited by very large numbers of people. The President of Poland and Mme. Rackiewicz visited the exhibition in June and were received by the Director of the National Gallery and the Council’s officer in Scotland. The exhibition will remain in Edinburgh until the end of July, after which it will be toured in Scotland and England under the auspices of C.E.M.A. Whilst the exhibition remains in Edinburgh a concert of Allied musicians is held every Wednesday evening in the National Gallery. So far concerts by Belgian, Czechoslovak, French, Polish and Yugoslav artists have been arranged. These concerts have been of an excellent standard and the average audience 9 attending is in the neighbourhood of 300. (b) With the assistance of the Council’s Music Committee, concerts have been arranged at various national centres, and in addition it has been possible, through co-operation with C.E.M.A., to provide concerts for Allied nationals in the main provincial centres. Arrangements have also been made to enable a limited number of non-British nationals to attend the daily concerts at the National Gallery in London. (c) Gramophone Concerts. —A number of gramophones and gramophone records have been presented, mainly to isolated forestry units. The majority of people employed in these units are of a high educational standard and appreciate good music. Entertainments and Cultural Contacts. The Council is constantly asked to devise plans to enable a greater number of Allied nationals to visit British homes. Much work of this nature is, of course, done by a variety of organisations, but the Council is exploring the methods by which it may be further extended, and by which Allied airmen in particular may be afforded opportunities of spending their leave in peaceful and pleasant surroundings. Students and. Children. (a) Students. —In co-operation with the Allied Governments and voluntary £ organisations, the Council is selecting students of Allied nationality for whom continued university or technical training is considered desirable, the Council is consulting with the Universities to ensure that admission of non-British students into the Universities may be spread justly among the several nationalities and at the same time remain in accord with the Universities’ general policy on admissions in war-time. Allied students who have received grants through the Resident Foreigners Division of the Council have been invited to a vacation course in Cambridge organised by the Council during July. (b) Children. —The trustees of the Moulton-Mayer Fund of the Royal College of Music are very generously devoting the whole fund to the provision of one-year scholarships for children of non-British nationality, aged between 14 and 17 years. The Council has agreed to supplement this fund' and, in collaboration with the Allied Governments, is assisting the College to choose suitable candidates. The Council continued to be in close touch with various schools organised by the Allied Governments in the United Kingdom. Frequent visits are paid by the Council’s officers to these schools, and besides provision of teachers of English and educational equipment, it has been arranged for children from the Czecho slovak Boarding School to be entertained in Liverpool by a Liverpool girls’22 school; a group of boys from the Polish School have been entertained in Edinburgh by the Council; and the Council is also assisting in finding hospitality for children from the French Lycee during the summer holidays. National Centres. The Polish Hearth. —During the past quarter the attendances at the Polish Hearth have been increased to between five and six hundred weekly, there have been : — Concerts ... ... ... ... ... ... 17 Lectures ... ... ... ... ... ... fi Dances ... ... ... ... ... ... 6 Bridge evenings ... ... ... ... ... 7 Social evenings ... ... ... ... ... 5 In addition, some 120 private Polish meetings were held on the premises and an exhibition of Polish photographs which was opened by H.E. the President of Poland. Eleven English classes were held weekly, attended by some 70 students, and a course of Polish classes began in May. The Czechoslovak Institute. —During the past quarter there have been :— Lectures (19) : 7 (organised by Institute), 5 (by other leading societies), ^ 7 (meetings of joint English and Czechoslovak societies). Dances : 6. Social Evenings : 16 (13, every Monday, for members). M. Masaryk, Dr. Ripka and Mr. H. G. Wells were amongst the distinguished lecturers. Arrangements have been made whereby Czechoslovak soldiers visiting London on leave can receive advice on where to live and what to see in London. Hospitality for service men can also be arranged through the Institute. Besides the concerts held on alternate Sundays, a Music Club meets at the Institute every Tuesday with an average attendance of forty people. Women’s meetings are held every Thursday. Items of especial interest have been an exhibition of photographs of Czechoslovakia and of paintings by Professor Matousek. Every Monday afternoon an “At Home ’* is held for members, with an average attendance of 100 Czechoslovak and English people. Fifteen English classes are held weekly at the Institute, and a library has been organised under the direction of a trained Czechoslovak librarian. Several generous donations of books have been made to the library by Czechoslovak and British nationals. In addition, a fine collection of pictures by Czechoslovak artists has been lent to the Institute for the duration of the war. Many of these pictures are at the moment on loan to the Allied Art Exhibition in Edinburgh. The Allied Centre, Liverpool. —This Centre was opened by the Duchess of Kent on the 22nd April and completely destroyed by enemy action on the 2nd May. A new Allied Centre has now been created, once more in excellent premises. ^ In the interval the Council’s work in Liverpool was carried on without a break ^ from temporary premises. The last function in the original centre was a very successful celebration of the Polish National Day, attended by the Lord Mayor of Liverpool. Celebrations of the Norwegian National Day were carried through successfully from temporary premises. The anxiety expressed by the people of Liverpool for the speedy recreation of the Centre and, equally important, the fact that the Allied nationals and merchant seamen followed the Centre from its original premises to its temporary premises and now to the new premises in great numbers, have greatly encouraged the Council. It is of interest to note that a number of Yugoslav seamen have attended daily English classes at the Centre and were given a lunch by the Council’s officers before their departure. The Scottish-Polish Hoiise. —The Scottish-Polish House was opened on the 1st June in Edinburgh by the Rt. Hon. Lord Elgin. Here a regular programme of lectures, music and film shows is arranged; a teacher of English is permanently attached, and organises English classes for Polish nationals, including children, in Edinburgh. Classes in Polish are also held for Scottish people.23 In June a Norwegian Seamen’s Hostel and Club was opened in a northern port by H.R.H. Crown Prince Olaf of Norway. These premises have been provided by the Norwegian Government, the Council having co-operated in the provision of libraries and educational equipment. A Club for Allied and Neutral seamen is being created in another northern port jointly by the Norwegian and Dutch Governments, the Council and various Scottish voluntary associations. The Belgian House .—In collaboration with the Belgian Government, the Council has agreed to the creation of a Maison Beige in London. A committee composed of representatives of the Belgian Government, the Foreign Office and the Council are seeking suitable premises. Evacuees from Gibraltar. The Council are now in touch with all the centres established for evacuees from Gibraltar and have arranged film shows at many of the centres. Much educational material has been supplied, and excursions to places of interest in the London area organised. The Council is also encouraging the teaching of English at these centres and, in collaboration with the L.C.C., is examining the need for secondary school education and technical training.(16097) [L 2984/1262/410] THE BRITISH COUNCIL.

Mr. Herbert Read, D.S.O., M.C., D.Litt., and Mr. Clive Bell have been appointed members of the Fine Arts Committee. The Minister of Information has appointed the Honourable Harold Nicolson, C.M.G., M.P., to be his liaison officer with the Council. Sir Angus Gillan, K.B.E., C.M.G., formerly Civil Secretary, Sudan Govern ment, and lately Principal Officer for the North Midland Civil Defence Region has been appointed to the Council’s staff to take charge of work in the Empire.

A number of the Council’s institutes in Egypt were kept open throughout the summer, though attendance was naturally small. At the British Institute, Alexandria, the lounge and library were in use throughout the summer, thanks mainly to the assistance of the librarian, who is herself a student at the institute. It is satisfactory to record that despite air raids 221 students attended the institute in August. A successful institute camp, held one week-end during August, was organised by Mr. Bell and the Rover Scout troop. 1 he Scientific and Economic Societies now have a regular attendance of about 50 at their meetings. A fresh catalogue of the library, which now has some 114 students as subscribers, has been completed by two students. The club at the British Institute, Minia, flourished throughout the summer and arranged at least two entertainments every week, while the women’s club run by Mrs. Deuchars, the director’s wife, continued to be well attended. In July the number of students attending Mansourah Institute was very low, chiefly owing to the season, but the club maintained its strength with 74 members. A successful exhibition of Council films was held at the institute in July and was attended by over 90 persons. At the Institute, Tanta, a number of lectures have been held on the root ot the institute during the summer. The cinematograph projector is a great success and already some 2,500 people in Tanta have seen the Council s films. Since the Council already own the building of the Ma’adi Preparatory School, Cairo, it has been decided to purchase the site on which the building is situated. Mr. F. S. Revel 1, the Council’s film officer in the Near and Middle East, arrived in Cairo in August. Messrs. C. E. J. Leech, G. Humphreys Roberts, A. T. Baker and A. Robinson have left this country recently to take up appointments in the Near and Middle East region, and Mr. 1 Brian Jones will shortly be following them. Palestine. The classes for Moslem women in Nablus at present held by Mrs. Savage, the wife of the director, are to be developed into a women’s annexe to the institute with a resident woman director. The institute has been kept open during the summer and has been full every day, some 70 students and club members being in the building at any one time. A short lecture course on phonetics was attended by an average of 40, including some schoolmasters on holiday. Classes in Arabic, primarily for British people resident in Nablus, are also being held. The Council’s films are popular, as Nablus, which is a town of about 2,000 inhabitants, has no cinema. The director has arranged for a swimming pool to be used by the institute students and club members, and this also is proving popular. The Council have recently approved the establishment of British clubs at Jenin and Nazareth. These clubs are to be under the supervision of Mr. Savage. A den. Colonel Lake, who had been absent on sick leave, returned to Aden in July. The club of the Aden Institute was opened on 30th July by his Excellency the Governor, who, in his speech, expressed the hope that it would be a meeting place for all communities. The latest report shows that the club, under the temporary direction of Mr. Madsen, now has some 200 members drawn largely from the Arabic, Jewish and Indian communities, but including some Europeans and British officials. The Council have made a small grant to provide scholastic materials for four Koranic schools in the Western Protectorate. Iraq. The institute club, which had been closed because of the events of May, was reopened on the 1st July in the house and garden of the White Lodge, where the new Bagdad Institute is eventually to be built. The formal opening was held on the 30th July and some 200 members and guests attended, amongst whom were the Prime Minister, his Excellency Sayid Jamil-al-Midfai, and all members of3 the Cabinet, his Excellency the British Ambassador, who is president of the club, his Excellency the American Minister, the Egyptian Charge d'Affaires, the Saudi Arabian Charge d’Affaires, Amir Liwa Ismail Namiq, and other senior officers of the Iraqi army, Lieutenant-General Quinan and Major-General Waterhouse, officers of the Iraqi and British Armies and R.A.F., the Directors-General of all the Government Departments and many members of the British and Iraqi communities. A number of old and new members have already joined the club, which, with its shady garden and terrace on the river, is most favourably situated. During July sixty-three students attended classes, a satisfactory figure in view of the shortness of time since the reopening. Of these students, ten are Iraqi State Railways trainees, who will ultimately proceed to Britain for further training in different branches of railway management. Cyprus. Reports for the previous quarter recently received give the following average totals of student and club membership at the British Institutes during the past season:— Nicosia Larnaca Famagusta Kyrenia 408 (full to capacitv) 182 137 112 As previously reported, the institutes ceased normal work for the vacation in June. That in Nicosia remained open throughout the summer as a social club for Allied troops and club members, and was well attended. Various entertain ments were arranged by the director and Greek classes formed for British troops and others. The institute in Kyrenia was open for social activities in August. Five Council lecturers are now back in Cyprus for the coming academic session— — —*— T urkey. The Council representative, Mr. Michael Grant, visited Cairo in September to discuss the Council’s work in Turkey with Mr. Dundas. Mr. Grant and the Council lecturers have strengthened their relations with high Turkish officials. Great interest in the Council’s work is shown by many members of the Government circle. The focal point of the Council’s work continues to be the English teaching at the Halkevleri (“Peoples Houses’’). The number of Halkevleri in which English classes are held by Council teachers rose from six in April to eleven in July. They comprise the Ankara Halkevi, Halkevleri at Izmir, Manisa, Canak- kale and Mersin, the principal Halkevi at Istanbul and five others there. During the same period the number of pupils taught increased from 560 to 1,118. Special success attended the courses at Izmir and Manisa, the centre of the richest agri cultural district in Turkey. Negotiations have begun with a view to starting classes at another eight Halkevleri in the provinces. Mr. N. A. Miller, whose appointment as technical adviser to the Turkish Government was arranged by the Council, has prepared a report on the proposed Polytechnic at Ankara, for presentation to President Inonii. Copies of the report have been distributed to the Government Departments and technical firms concerned. Mr. A. R. Thompson continued the English classes at Yildiz Public Works Technical School, Istanbul, and Mr. Rayner concluded a successful term at the Agricultural Machinery School in Ankara. Another course was started by Mr. A. H. Cooke at the Agricultural Research Institute near Smyrna. Drs. Du Val, Legg and Mcllwraith, selected by the Council for the Profes sorships of Mathematics, Industrial Chemistry and English at Istanbul University, have left for Turkey. Thirty-four lectures were organised by the Council during the quarter April- June, twenty-five of these being delivered at Halkevleri. Eleven were public lectures, attended by an average audience of 300, the remaining twenty-three being to special audiences. These lectures included one by the British Ambas sador at the School of Political Sciences, Ankara, and twenty by Professor [23082] b 2Hamley, who, visiting Turkey from Iraq, is now a well-known and popular figure in Ankara and Istanbul. The Turkish authorities arranged visits for Professor Hamley to a large number of schools. By order of the Minister of Education, 120 teachers of English in Istanbul were bidden to attend his course of three lectures on “ The Teaching of English,” which were held at a Halkevi specially lent by the People’s party. The Minister instructed each teacher to write a report on the course, and has appointed an official to study the reports with a view to introducing amendments in the English curriculum. Professor Hamley’s lectures on “ Child Development ” also attracted wide interest among teachers, and the Minister of Education has asked him to co-operate in drawing up a questionnaire regarding child delinquency. Professor Hamley has also been invited to collaborate with two Turkish teachers in the reform of examinations at the Turk Maarif Lycee, Ankara, and has written two reports on the English examination system for the Minister of Education. Special three months’ summer courses were arranged by Mr. Grant for Turkish teachers of English. No details have yet been received. Summer courses were also arranged for English students at two Lycees in Istanbul. Mr. Littler’s original six months’ appointment to teach army and air force cadets at Robert College has been extended. Courses have also been held at Istanbul for army doctors from the Grithane Hospital and for officers at the Canakkale Halkevi. Mr. Grant has asked for further staff from England to teach English at w Halkevleri in Ankara and the provinces and at the Higher Agricultural Institution, Ankara, and to teach English and Natural Science at the Turk Maarif Lycees in Ankara and Brusa. Three men have already been sent to Cairo, where selections will be made for Turkey and further appointments are pending. Meanwhile, grants have been made for the appointment of four additional English teachers locally. Mr. Catt, selected by the Council for the post of inspector of the Botanical Gardens at Istanbul, completed a successful term’s work in the Botanical Depart ment of Istanbul University. Mr. J. McCrae, appointed by the Council to be sports trainer at the British Institute, Bagdad, has been seconded to the post of Athletics Director at Robert College, Istanbul, and Mr. W. J. Baggett, football coach to the Hellenic Football Association, Athens, from 1938 to the present year, has been appointed football coach to the Galatasaray Club, Istanbul. For the Turkish daily press, Mr. C. E. Bazell is compiling and collecting articles on British institutions, and English lessons prepared by Council staff have appeared in provincial papers. English classes for the staffs of the “ Ulus ” and the “Anadolu” Press Agencies have continued. Full-length transcriptions of the ambassador’s lecture on the British Commonwealth and Professor Hamley’s lecture on the “ Spirit of British Education ” were published in official educational journals. In connection with the provision of educational facilities for British subjects ** in Turkey, the Council have extended up to November their grant to the British Embassy School at Ankara, and as a first step in the reorganisation of the instruction of Maltese in Smyrna Mr. C. Lake has instituted summer courses. Classes for Maltese in Istanbul haA^e continued, and English lessons are being arranged at Ankara for Maltese staff of the embassy and Greek-speaking Cypriots! (b) Rest of Europe. Spain. ffhe summer course at the British Institute in Madrid proved a most satis factory experiment. About fifty students, all hard workers, attended the course. Most of them aie employees in Government offices and shops, who are very keen to learn English. A paity was gi\en in honour of Captain Holland of the Ark Royal in July. Theie weie about 100 guests representative of various political groups as well as artists, painters, English people and friendly foreign representatives. Professor Staikie was in London in August for three weeks to discuss the Council’s activities m Spain.5 Portugal. Following Mr. West’s appointment as Council representative in Portugal, Mr. Shillan, late director of the British Institute in Yugoslavia and acting Council representative there, has been appointed deputy director of the British Institute m Portugal and has taken up his duties. Mr. Kaye and Miss Williams, from the London olhce, have been appointed respectively .accountant and confidential secretary to the institute in Lisbon and have also taken up their duties. three performances were given in August, in the Palhava Park in Lisbon, of Shakespeare s Midsummer Night’s Dream ’ in Portuguese. The Portuguese translation used was made by Mr. Ley, lecturer at the British Institute in Lisbon. I he play drew audiences totalling 7,000 persons. A most successful refresher course for Portuguese teachers of English took place from the 9th to the ^Ist August. Excursions, musical entertainments and film shows were organised in connection with the course. Twenty-one Portuguese professors attended. Malta. Membership of the British Institute, Valletta, rose during the quarter by 226 to 1.424. This figure compares with 1,490 at the 30th September, 1940, and is highly satisfactory considering the trying conditions of the past academic year. 1 he institute has remained open, and the connection of the air-raid shelter with a public rock shelter has improved attendance figures. Though there were no lectures or concerts, the library, radio-gramophone and social activities attracted as many members as is usual during the hot weather. With financial assistance from the Council and the advice of the Drama Department, the director arranged for the erection of a stage in the large hall of the institute, and hoped that it would be ready by the end of September. The programme for 1941—42 has been prepared and printed. It provides for an average of nine fixtures monthly between October and next July. Mr. Dundas visited Malta in August en route to Cairo. Iceland. The Council’s representative in Iceland, Mr. Cyril Jackson, visited this country during the quarter with a party of Icelanders representing the Icelandic press. Much work is now being done in conjunction with the Icelandic Broadcasting Company. The daily English Hour is partially arranged by Mr. Jackson, and English plays and music (largely provided by or through the Council) are a prominent feature. Mr. Jackson has also discovered a small Wblsh choir, which is now being used regularly for broadcasting. Finland. The British Council teachers in Finland were evacuated with the Legation staff. &amp; Sweden. The summer school at Sigtuna, organised by Mr. Charlesworth under the auspices of the Council, was again held and some 120 teachers and students participated. The Council have received encouraging reports from Mr. Cedric Hentschel, the newly appointed lecturer in English at Uppsala University, where a number of social activities are being arranged in addition to the normal lectures. With a view to the increase of activities in Sweden, the Council has appointed Mr. R. Bottrall its representative in that country. (c) Ihero-America. A rgentina. With the help of a committee of prominent Argentine and British residents, Mr. C. W. Yates, who arrived at Rosario in May, has already succeeded in estab lishing an Argentine Association of English Culture there. English classes have been started and books, periodicals, films and a sound projector have been pre sented by the Council. A general grant is also being made.' The Association has sixty members and 160 students. [23082] c *6 Brazil. The latest reports from the newly inaugurated Anglo-Brazilian Cultural Society at Belo Horizonte show that the Society now has a membership of over 150, and that 230 students are attending English classes. The number of students at the Anglo-Brazilian Cultural Society at Rio de Janeiro is now 1,100. Among new social activities of the Society have been the organisation of country excursions. At Sao Paulo there are 1,600 students. The Council have been able to arrange for Mr. Boa Vista, a Brazilian post graduate student of international law, to undertake research work in this country. Mr. Boa Vista has already arrived. Four lecturers, who have been chosen by the Council on behalf of the Anglo- Brazilian Cultural Society, will shortly leave for Brazil, where they will be attached to the Society at Rio de Janeiro in the first place. Chile. In connection with the Santiago de Chile Fourth Centenary Celebrations, the Council have presented to the Chilean nation copies of portraits of George Canning and Lord Cochrane, both of whom are remembered for their contribu tions to the independence of Chile. The Chilean-British Cultural Institute, Santiago, reports a membership of 250. 660 students (twice as many as last year) are now attending the institute’s f* courses, which number thirty-two and include special courses for officers of the Chilean Air Force and for workmen. In addition, 160 extra-mural students are receiving instruction. A move to new premises has rendered possible a considerable expansion in the institute’s social activities. Among these, the library, film shows, debates and concerts are specially popular. The Chilean-British Institute at Valparaiso was formally opened at a party attended by the Governor of the province, the British Ambassador, the British Consul-General and about 300 members and friends. Since then the enthusiasm, generosity and organising ability of the Chilean and British commu nities in Valparaiso and the energy of the institute’s directors and staff have made possible a considerable development of the institute’s activities. There are now about 300 students. A Chilean-British Cultural Institute has also been opened at Concepcion. Again, a tribute must be paid to the enthusiasm of both the Chilean and the British residents, who organised the institute in a remarkably short time. There are 250 students. d he Centro Anglo-Chileno, Santiago, has 150 students. Fhe Council s assistance to British schools in Chile has been maintained, aiid it can now be said that the Council is directly interested in the teachin°’ of English to over 5,000 students. I wo Chilean doctors are now studying in this country under the auspices &gt; of the Council. ' ' ^ Colombia. By the courtesy of the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company Mr. H. H. R. Ihompson has been able to assume the post of British Council’s representative in Colombia. Mr. Thompson has for some time past held high positions in the company s organisation m both Colombia and Venezuela, and his experience will render his services most valuable to the Council. In consultation with His Majesty s Legation, Mr. Ihompson will supervise the work of the institutes at Bogota, Medelm, Cali, Barranquilla and Santa Marta, and also keep iL touch with the Mission of five teachers sent to Colombia in January 1940 in fulfilment Council CU Agreement between the Colombian Government and the British Progress has been made by all the institutes. Those at Medellin and Barran quilla report that they now have 400 and 250 students respectively. Membe s of the Bogota Institute have joined m giving performances of the “ Pirates of ofThe British 1 Red '»“»* - »***. ^Ecuador. Mr. R. J. Evans has visited Ecuador on behalf of the Council to investigate the possibility of opening a British school. Peru. The British-Peruvian Cultural Association of Southern Peru, which was inaugurated at Arequipa on the 11th May, now has a membership of just over 120. The association has been enthusiastically welcomed in the press. Its presi dent is Mr. A. C. Roden, British Vice-Consul at Arequipa. The British-Peruvian Cultural Association in Lima reports that 140 students are attending its courses. Among the association’s general activities are monthly social evenings, with singing and entertainment, and a fortnightly series of lectures. His Majesty’s Minister at Lima has given a series of talks, illus trated with gramophone records, on English folk music. Film shows have also been arranged. Uruguay. On the occasion of his relinquishment of the post of His Majesty’s Minister at Montevideo, Mr. Eugen Millington-Drake has received moving tributes from all classes of Uruguayan society, but nowhere will his departure be more regretted than in cultural and intellectual circles. Mr. Millington-Drake’s knowledge both of British and of Uruguayan culture equipped him to a remarkable extent for the work of promoting intellectual understanding between the two countries, and he was unstmtingly generous in forwarding this important work. Before returning to this country Mr. Millington-Drake will visit the Argen tine, Chile, Peru and Venezuela, and he will be able to comment on the Council’s work in these countries when he arrives in London. The Anglo-Uruguayan Cultural Institute in Montevideo has now moved into new premises, which are stated to be a great improvement upon the old. There will now be much greater scope for the social activities at the institute. An interesting side of this institute’s work is the organisation of three extra-mural courses. These have been provided for the Escuela Industrial, the Chauffeur Club (the members of which are Montevideo taxi-drivers) and the Federacion Uruguay de Obreras de Comercio e Industria. The cost of them has hitherto been met by Mr. Millington-Drake himself. (d) Other Countries. U.S.S.R. Many proposals for activity in Russia have reached the Council. The physical difficulties alone are considerable, and speedy action can scarcely be expected. This important question is not, however, being neglected. In the mean time, the action taken in response to an application for music from His Majesty’s Ambassador in Moscow is recorded under the heading appropriate to that subject. J afan. The work of the British Library of Information and Culture at Tokyo continued during the quarter. Belgian Congo. The Council’s new representative in the Belgian Congo, Mr. F. Y. Thompson, arrived at Leopoldville on the 13th August and has already found suitable premises for a proposed British Institute. His Majesty’s Consul-General and the Belgian authorities are giving Mr. Thompson considerable assistance, and, from his first reports, there seems every prospect of the Council’s work in the Belgian Congo both proving successful and exercising a substantial influence over a wide area. Mr. Thompson has been asked to co operate in arranging the “ English Half-hour ” on Radio-Leo and the Council are providing gramophone records for this purpose. Books for a nuclear library are also being despatched. [23082] * c*2/ w III. —Functional Activities. „ 7 Books and Periodicals. Book Presentations. Many presentations of books have been made on recommendations received tiom missions and from the Council’s representatives abroad. These include a selection of books on tuberculosis and the medical and economic rehabilitation of tubercular convalescents, compiled at the suggestion of Professor West and sent o him for presentation in Portugal. Specimen copies of English textbooks have been sent to the British Consul in the Faroe Islands, for a school which is now unable to obtain its usual Danish textbooks, and as many books as possible have been sent, to Sweden. There is an increasing demand for British textbooks in the Belgian Congo, and a recent presentation to Leopoldville gave rise to a suggestion from the British Consul-General at Duala that similar books should be sent to the French Cameroons, where English classes are given for both children and adults. I he presentations which are made regularly to the Latin- American countries have included during the past three months a Nuclear Library for the new Argentine Association of English Culture in Rosario and a selection oi books on British methods of dealing with social problems, presented to the Chilean-British Cultural Institute in Santiago. T , A Presentation of books has been made to the East London Mosque and Islamic Culture Centre. ^ A generous gift of £100 for presentations of books to Icelanders has been made to the Council by an anonymous donor through the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Resident Foreigners. The distribution of educational and general literature in English and foreien languages to foreigners resident in this country has continued. During the anri r 2 r 7 rtV' lan g' a g&lt;*, 3,048 English novels and other books snnnliprf^ C ? g l f Sh tex . tbooks w ?, re distributed. The last figure includes books supplied to Centres where pupils are enteting for the Oxford and Cambridge certificate examinations. &amp; Book Review Scheme. This scheme is increasing in scope and vitality. In Latin America especially InTdSrtn b0 j 0ks ° f the ™ st ^^rse kinds is Sg. addition to the regular work already in progress, a number of special reouests BTbulTLTwrktv'ii kw Ied - L’’ ^ x '™P le ’ the Argentine periodical through Mr Ch.irrh C p 0I ' dealmg wlth Biblioal studies - In Brazil, sublets have been h ^ a h nM 0 t, U u CI ] 8 re P resentatl W- a number of books on technical Tecfnology b despatched for review m the periodical of the Institute of Technical books sent in the regular monthly supplies to Brazil have been largely concerned with agriculture, as have those to other South American countnes.

Books sent out for review are eligible for order under the Book Export Scheme. Book Exhibitions. In response to an urgent request from the Ministry of Information, a small quantity of books was purchased in England and arrangements made for the purchase in Cairo of a further £300 worth for exhibition at the Smyrna Fair. A permanent exhibition of Fine Printing has been offered to the British Library of Information in New York and a small exhibition of books showing the high quality of British production and illustration is in process of assembly for Mexico, where the books exhibited will also be stocked by local bookshops under the Book Export Scheme. A comprehensive exhibition of British textbooks is about to be despatched to Colombia and there is a suggestion that this exhibition should be transferred later to Ecuador. An exhibition of books and textbooks, mainly recent publications, is being organised for Madrid. Book Export Scheme. This Scheme is expanding rapidly and shows every indication of being far more successful than was originally anticipated. In South America, in addition to the orders previously received from Chile, Colombia, Uruguay and Peru, two orders—one of considerable size—have been received from Brazil, and an order worth £500 has been received from a bookseller in Lima, Peru, who, thanks to the energy displayed by the Honorary Attache to the Legation, is stocking one of his shops with English books. In Europe the Scheme has been put into operation in Portugal, where an English bookshop will be opened in Lisbon in October by a Portuguese bookseller of standing. In Egypt, orders valued at more than £1,000 have been placed. It is hoped that these books will provide a source of supply for the other countries in the Middle East. Turkish Book Subsidy. The first orders have now been received and as it develops this arrangement should do much to assist Turkish booksellers in meeting the demand for English books. Publications. The bound volume of British Life and Thought, with a Foreword by the Right Honourable the Earl of Derby, was published by Longmans Green on the 22nd September, at 85. 6^. net. The brochures have been reprinted separately during the quarter, those most in demand being British Social Services, The British System of Government and The Face of Britain. British Trade Unions has been written by John Price and The British Co-operative Movement is being written by George Darling, both for publication shortly at 15. net. The new series of International Guild Books is nearing publication. It will consist of illustrated books in Penguin size and style, in Czech, Dutch, French, Greek, Norwegian and Polish, with other languages to follow, and will be issued for the Council by the British Publishers’ Guild at various prices from 6d. upwards. The first volumes will include translations of Come and See Britain, by Guy Ramsey, a rapid conducted tour; the two Oxford pamphlets on the British Empire; and some of the British Life and Thought brochures. Publications planned during the quarter include A Short History of Eiigland, to be written for adult foreigners who know nothing of the subject, and a book on leading modern British authors, intended to introduce some fifty of them informally to foreign readers. [23082] d*British Book News. By changes made during the past quarter the time required for printing and distributing the monthly issues has been halved. In addition, with the June issue an air mail edition was inaugurated, and this is being despatched by air every month to specially selected addresses. The total circulation is now over thirteen thousand. The News remains an integral part of the Book Export Scheme, for which all titles listed in it are available, but, in addition, it provides outside the Scheme unique publicity for British books. Arrangements have been made for the 1941 issues, with a complete index, to be published as a bound volume by Longmans Green early in 1942. Copies will be presented to important libraries, booksellers, &amp;c., and it will also be on sale at about 105. 6 g?. net. Book Lists. The Council has sponsored and distributed a number of National Book Council Book Lists, including those on Literary Prizes, Latin America, Poland and Turkey. All books in these sponsored lists are available for the Book Export Scheme. Periodicals. Despite the adverse effect of some recent events, especially in the Near East, the distribution of newspapers and periodicals continues to increase, new sub scriptions for the quarter totalling 6,893. In collaboration with the British Medical Information Service a series of exchanges has been arranged between Medical Associations and publishers of periodicals in this country and their counterparts in Spain, Portugal and Latin America. The majority have been made free, but where this was impracticable the Council has borne the cost of subscriptions. Numerous letters of appreciation continue to be received, particularly from the African colonies and Protectorates, m the vein of the following extracts ■ From the Librarian of Achimota College, Gold Coast. We are now getting regular deliveries of a number of papers which we ha\e never been able to altord. All sections of the College are deriving great benefit fiom the pciiodicals now reaching us. The illustrated papers provide our teacher-training students with a wealth of pictures for the teaching-practice, besides giving those who read them a very good idea of war conditions at home in England. . . . Nor is it only the teacher students who are gaming from the generosity of the Council. A paper like 1 he Aeroplane is of very great interest to our many engineering students.” From the Information Officer, Sierra Leone. I have now received letters from all those whom you are so good as to supply with periodicals. I am of the opinion that the pantrs are particularly valuable in the schools.” 1 P trom trie secretary w vu,v \*vucrn,mvni, rsyasaianct. conceri^d 6 ’^ 6061151 ° f ^ periodicals is ver y mu ch appreciated by al From^he Commissioner for Home Affairs and Education, Newfoundland. These periodicals will be greatly appreciated and will assist tremendously ,n keeping our pupils, more especially those in remote and isolated settlements, in touch with the trend of events in the outside world.” Arrangements have been made during the quarter for the regular supply of(b) Britain To-day. The United States continue to receive a larger number of copies of Britain To-day than any other single country, but the Latin American countries, which for comparison may be considered together, are not far behind. Distribu tion in the former (through the British Library of Information in New York) totals 40,000; in the Latin American countries, 34,000; and if it is possible to satisfy requests which have been received for more, the circulation will exceed the number sent to the United States. It has become urgent that Britain To-day, in its Spanish and Portuguese editions, should be made more generally available in South America. Some of the Governments in that continent discountenance or forbid the dissemination of foreign propaganda. But Britain To-day is not propaganda, and is welcomed as providing information about Great Britain which cannot easily be found elsewhere. (c) Drama. An informal conference of leading British play agents was held to consider ways and means of increasing the supply of British plays to Latin America, of providing for their adequate translation and performance and of establishing a central agency in Buenos Aires to conduct negotiations and collect royalties. The practice continues of sending British plays to institutes, play-reading societies and dramatic clubs in Europe, Latin America, Malta and Egypt. (d) Films. New Production. (1) Newsreels. British News (the Council’s composite British newsreel) continues to be regularly distributed each week, with the co-operation of the Colonial Office and the Ministry of Information, to thirty-two British Colonies. Copies of British News are also sent to Portugal each week, and are shown by His Majesty’s Embassy to specially invited audiences at the Estrela Hall in Lisbon. (2) Documentaries. The following films were completed and distribution begun :— Royal Road. —The public activities and home life of Their Majesties The King and Queen. This picture is now being widely shown in Great Britain. Both I he King and Queen took a close interest in its making; and it contains an interesting section, not hitherto shown, of intimate views of Their Majesties and the Princesses at home. Morning Paper.— production of a daily newspaper. Power to Order .—British locomotives under construction and repair. Colour in Clay (Colour).—Pottery design and manufacture. Border Weave (Colour).—The Border and its woollen manufactures. Sea Scouts. —Social service and education at work and play. Commentaries. Commentaries are now being recorded in ten languages. Distribution. During the quarter 797 prints of Council films were despatched to 71 territories. Theatrical. —323 prints for cinemas in 68 territories, some of which are duplicating prints from which as many further copies can be taken as are required. Distribution in most cases was arranged through ordinary commercial film trade channels and in competition with short films produced by other countries. The Council’s colour films are proving most popular; and it is interesting to note that Axis countries are unable to produce films in technicolour. [23082] D * 212 Non-theatrical. —391 prints sent to Eduoation Authorities and other institu tions and organisations in 27 territories. British Institutes. —83 prints were added to the libraries equipped with projectors. Canadian National Exhibition. At the request of the Department of Overseas Trade, the Council arranged for a continuous performance of Council and Ministry of Information films during the fourteen days the Exhibition was open. The organiser of the cinema reports: “ I estimate we had an attendance of 3,500 people a day for each of the fourteen days. We had a line-up outside the doors of two or three hundred people, and had a couple of policemen to handle the crowd.” The following are extracts from reports received :— Australia. —The Documentary Films Committee of New South Wales expressed “ general pleasure, in certain instances very distinct pleasure indeed, on seeing the Council’s films.” South Africa. —Union Department of Education : “ The films will form a most useful addition to our library, and will undoubtedly enjoy a very wide circulation .... the recording of the Afrikaans commentaries is delight fully clear and crisp, without any background.” Egypt. —The Tanta Institute reports : “ The new industrial films are very slick and modern and just what we want.” Throughout the quarter ^ 12 films were shown to about 2,500 persons in the Institute. Turkey. —Cable from Istanbul: “ Coloured cultural films in Turkey very successful; can you send others ? ’ ’ St. Helena. —The Council’s films “ Bring home to the people the importance of the Empire and its unity and a knowledge of life outside the island. Most of the people have never been off the island and so their outlook tends to be insular and mid-Victorian.” Film Shows. In Scotland on the 17th September exhibitions of the Council’s films were given in the Regal Cinema, Edinburgh, to approximately 400 distinguished guests, including representatives of the University of Edinburgh and the Polish community. The Poles were particularly struck with Royal Road, which they said gave them an entirely new idea of British Monarchy. The films were shown the same day to representatives of the press and others in Glasgow. At the request of the Foreign Press Association, a show'of the Council’s films was given at Film House, Wardour Street, on the 27th August to a large number of foreign journalists and other guests. (e) Fine Arts. The Fine Arts Committee is greatly strengthened by the addition of % Mr. Clive Bell and Mr. Herbert Read. Exhibitions of Children's Drawings. The exhibition for Canada has been received with enthusiasm in Ottawa, and the Director of the National Gallery has cabled asking if the drawings may be sold and the proceeds given to war charities. News of the arrival of the collection for Rio de Janeiro has not yet been received, but the Council’s representative, Mr. Church, has reported that the Minister of Education and other educationalists are making preparations for the exhibition, which is to be well patronised. A third collection, prepared at the request of the Ministry of Information, has been despatched to Savannah, Georgia, and this will afterwards be circulated by the British Library of Information, New York. The Arts and Crafts Exhibition. Favourable cables have been received from Washington and New York indicating the form that the exhibition should take, and the centres, five in number, which should be visited.All the leading craftsmen in this country have been approached, and the response, m spite of the war, is encouraging. The sending-in day for exhibits has been fixed for the 30th October. Mr. Brian O’Rorke, F.R.I.B.A., has agreed to plan a layout capable of being adapted to the varying shapes of the American galleries. The Wakefield Collection. Works by the following artists have been purchased for the Council’s permanent collection since June last:— Edmund Blampied, John Buckland-Wright, Malcolm Osborne, P.R.E., John Piper, and William Wilson. This brings the number of works in the collection to 286. Exhibition of Modern Paintings for United States in 1942. A proposal has been received from Mr. Blake-More Godwin, President of the American Association of Museum Directors, that, with the help of Professor W. G. C onstable, Director of the Department of Paintings of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, he should organise an exhibition of British contemporary painting composed of selected examples from the Council’s two collections now in America, augmented by additional works by younger artists from this country. It is intended that the exhibition should be shown at some of the leading museums, especially in the Middle West, Subject to the concurrence of His Majesty’s Embassy at Washington, it is proposed to accept this invitation and to set up a sub-committee to select the work. The sub-committee is as follows: Sir Kenneth Clark (Chairman), Mr. Clive Bell, Mr. Herbert Read and Professor Randolph Schwabe. British Library of Information, New York. On receipt of a cable from the Library, asking for information on the “ Effects of the war upon Design and Designers,” to form the subject of an address at the National Conference at the American Designers’ Institute this month, over fifty experts in the chief professions and industries concerned were approached in Great Britain. Their replies were embodied in a Report which was duly despatched. Perhaps the most interesting points therein were the complete absence at present of artistic advertising in Great Britain, the increased use of plastics, the standardisation of many items in the building trades, and the immense amount of useful war work that was being carried out by art students in the leading art schools of the country. Coat of Arms. In addition to the Arms of the Council, mentioned in the last Report, Mr. Stephen Gooden, A.R.A., has produced a colophon, and Mr. George Friend, the well-known engraver, is now engraving a seal for the Council’s 'use, based upon Mr. Gooden’s design. (f) Lectures. Arrangements are proceeding for distinguished British lecturers to visit Spain and Portugal during the autumn and spring seasons. 1941-42. Professor W. J. Entwistle has recently left England on a lecture tour of South America. He will lecture in Spanish and Portuguese on “ The British Commonwealth of Nations,” “Law and Liberty in English Literature,” “ St. Thomas More,' “ The Ideals of the University in England,” “ The Poetry of the Younger Generation in England,” and, in Spanish only, on “ Cervantes in England.” (g) Music. Various scores were sent to the Embassy in Buenos Aires and to the Palestine Broadcasting Service in August and September respectively, a large selection of piano music to Cairo, and a set of song-books to the institute at Medellin14 (Colombia). A presentation of music scores and books on music was made to the institute in Madrid. In addition, regular monthly supplies of music were sent to the Press Attache, Madrid, for use there and in Barcelona, and a similar selection was sent in September to the Press Attache in Stockholm with an offer of regular monthly despatch. A foundation library of gramophone records has been despatched to Ankara and recordings of a march were sent out to Aden for use as a signature tune by the Radio Station there. Lectures on music have been given at the Ankara Dramatic School by a member of the Council’s Near Eastern staff, and at the Conservatoire Boarding School a concert of British music was given by the Director. In response to a telegraphic request from His Majesty’s Ambassador in U.S.S.R., the Council, with the assistance of Mr. Arthur Bliss, drew up six programmes of British music for concerts in Russia and despatched the necessary scores together with six programmes of gramophone records for broadcasting. The work of supplying gramophone records and sheet music to Resident Foreigners and Gibraltarian Centres has again increased, and a large selection of part-songs was sent to a RA.F. (Polish) station for a choir made up of the men stationed there. The concerts arranged during the quarter in this country are recorded under “ Resident Foreigners.” The Council, in conjunction with the Royal College of Music Moulton-Mayer Fund, offered a number of scholarships tenable for one year at the Royal College ^ of Music to students of non-British nationality. Five scholarships were finally awarded : three for violin, to a Hungarian, an Austrian and a German, one for piano to an Austrian, and one for singing to a Latvian. (h) Press and Receptions. Distribution of Press Material. The Council has continued its regular output of the “London Letter,” feature articles, photographs and stereos, in addition to matter specially commis sioned by contacts abroad. Distribution details for the quarter are as follows :— Centres of distribution ... ... ... ... ... 137 Foreign countries and colonial territories covered ... 79 Articles distributed (in English, French and Spanish) 48 “ London Letters ” distributed :— Daily edition (in English) ... ... 60 Weekly edition (in English and French) ... ... 13 Empire edition (in English) 13 South American edition (in English and Spanish) 13 Monthly Science News is despatched to the addresses on the Press mailing ^ list. ^ Photographs. All articles and “London Letters” susceptible of illustration are accom panied by photographs. During the quarter the output was as follows :— Photographic prints... ... ... ... 71,270 Stereos ... ... ... ... ... 42,460 The stereos have had a gratifying welcome from the Press of India and South America. At the beginning of September the despatch to India was doubled at the request of the India Office, and 200 prints and stereos of every photograph are now being sent there. A photographic dark room is in course of construction. With the Council’s staff photographer and suitable assistants, it will mean a large saving in the cost of producing prints, at the same time speeding up production and obtaining photographs more suitable to the material to be illustrated. In addition, features of British life which are to a large extent ignored by the commercial photo graphic agencies will be covered.15 The cost of this installation is reduced by the fact that the Council already possesses apparatus purchased previously with the Dixon-Scott collection of photographs. Publicity. Excellent publicity has been given in the British Press to the visits of the various Press delegations. It is worthy of note that the “ Express ” newspapers entertained the Canadian Delegation most generously. In addition to over 1,000 smaller news items, the following general articles on the Council’s work have appeared during the quarter :— July. Empire Review: “The British Council and the War.” July 28 .—Die Zeitung: “The British Council.” August 1 .—Bookseller: “The British Council’s Annual Report.” August 2%.—Nature: “The British Council.” On the 22nd July the Chairman addressed an All-Parties Panel meeting at the House of Commons on the work of the British Council. Mr. O’Brien has continued to lecture on the work of the Council to Rotary Clubs in various parts of the country. Assistance to Foreign Journalists. As noted under “Films,” the President, Committee and Members of the Foreign Press Association were entertained to a showing of the Council’s films on the 27th August. Receptions. The following functions, in addition to those in connection with the visits of delegations, were organised by the Press and Receptions Division August 15.—Luncheon to Mr. McNeill, General Manager, Canadian Press. September 11.—Luncheon to the Brazilian Ambassador and to Sir Noel Charles prior to the latter’s departure as Ambassador in Brazil. September 25.—Luncheon for the delegates from overseas attending the British Association Conference on Science and World Order. The Secretarv of State for Foreign Affairs was the principal speaker. Visits of Delegations. Icelandic Press Delegation .—The Icelandic Press delegation returned to Iceland on the 15th July. The large amount of space devoted in the Icelandic Press to eulogistic descriptions of their visit to Britain was an indication of the success of the visit. ProfessorH. F. Artucio .—On the 15th August Dr. Hugo Fernandez Artucio, Professor of Philosophy at Montevideo University, arrived in Britain for six weeks as the guest of the Council. The Council gave a luncheon for him on the 4th September, which was attended by the Uruguayan Minister.

The members of the party were Captain Pinto Sequeira, Lieutenant Reverendo Conceiyao and Senhor Luiz d’Avilez. They were accom panied by Mr. George Gogay, the British Physical Training Instructor to the Mocidade. They were received by the Secretary-General at the Council’s head quarters on the 17th September and by Mr. R. A. Butler, President of the Board of Education, on the 29th September. A programme was arranged, with the valuable co-operation of the Board of Education, enabling them to study various aspects of physical education in Britain. They returned to Lisbon on the 5th October. Canadian Press Delegation.—On the 20th September a delegation of Canadian editors and directors of newspapers arrived in Britain. The members of the party (described by Mr. Vincent Massey in a public speech as “ undoubtedlvthe most important and influential body of editors from Canada that has ever left the Dominion ’') were :— The Very Rev.

Mr. Lionel Shapiro: Washington correspondent Montreal Gazette. representing three Montreal English newspapers. Mr. Hugh Templin : Representing country weeklies of Canada. They were received by the Chairman at the Savoy Hotel on the 23rd September and by the Prime Minister on the 30th September. With the co-operation of the Dominions Office, the Ministry of Information, the High Commissioner for Canada, the War Office and the Air Ministry, the Council arranged a compre hensive programme enabling the delegation to study in a short time as many aspects of the war in Britain as possible. Individual Visitors. The Council organised a programme of visits in this country during September for the Governor of the Faroe Islands, and on the 18th July gave ;i luncheon for Senor Bernardi, which was attended by the Argentine Ambassador. (i) Science. Monthly Science News was started in August. It is printed in four editions : press and ordinary editions in English, and Spanish and Brazilian-Portuguese editions. The total distribution of the four editions at present exceeds 100,000 monthly. The manuscripts of two pamphlets on British scientific achievements have been delivered. One is by H. W. Dickinson on “James Watt” and the other is by Sir John Russell on “ Rothamsted Agricultural Experimental Station.” The Director-General of the British Broadcasting Corporation has discussed with the Chairman the ways in which the Council's Science Committee and the B.B.C. can co-operate in providing science broadcasts for overseas. The Secretary of the Science Committee was a member of the Executive Committee of the British Association’s Conference on “ Science and World Order.” This Conference received messages from The King, the Prime Minister and Field-Marshal Smuts. A luncheon in honour of the delegates from overseas was given by the British Council. The Chairman presided and Mr. Anthony Eden delivered a speech of welcome to the delegates, guests and participants. These included the President of Czechoslovakia, the Ambassadors of the U.S.S.R.. China and the United States, the High Commissioners of Australia and South Africa, Sir John Anderson, Mr. Ernest Brown, Mr. R. S. Hudson, Lord Woolton. Lord Hankey, Lord Cherwell, Sir William Bragg, Sir William Larke, Sir Edward Mellanby, Sir R. A. Gregory, Sir Henry Dale, Professor A. V. Hill and Professor A. C. Egerton; Professor Gulick, Professor Hansen and Professor Kuo Zing- Yang, wffio had specially flown to the Conference from the United States. Mr. W. O. Skeat, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, has been engaged to assist in the editing of the Illustrated Brochure of British Engineering Achievement. British Medical Information Service. For the greater part of a year the Council have been working in co-operation with the British Medical Information Service. This service was organised at the request of the Ministry of Information (Commercial Relations Division) by the British Medical Association. It was housed in offices adjacent to those of17 the Biitish Medical Journal. Dr. N. Howard Jones, who is in charge of the service, reported periodically to the Medical Propaganda Committee of the - ssociation, which was constituted for this purpose, and worked under the general supervision of the British Medical Journal authorities. . The work of the British Medical Information Service has hitherto consisted principally in the preparation of abstracts in Spanish of papers appearing in ui isn medical journals and their despatch to medical journals in Ibero-America, pam and elsewhere; in the supply of original articles on medical subjects and in arranging for the exchange of British medical journals with like journals in oreign countries. This work has met with a considerable measure of success. p -in 6 cou, j? ^ was a &amp; ree d between the Ministry of Information and the Council that medical propaganda was more properly the concern of the Council, which had already carried out much work in this sphere and, in the medical panel or the Science Committee, possessed highly qualified advisers. Accordingly, administration of the subsidy previously granted by the Ministry to the British Medical Association for the purpose of the Medical Information Service was transferred to the Council and Surgeon Rear-Admiral Gordon Gordon-Taylor, a member of the Council’s medical panel, became Chairman of the Medical I ropaganda Committee, whose meetings were already being attended by a repre sentative of the Council. It has since been arranged between the British Medical Association and the Council that the Medical Information Service should become a department of the Council, Dr. Howard Jones entering the Council’s service for this purpose and transferring his offices to Hanover Street. The Biitish Medical Association had rendered an outstanding service in setting up and supporting this organisation. The members of the Committee and officials of the Association, particularly Dr. Hugh Clegg, had devoted much time and labour to its successful development. Accordingly, the Council is deeply appieciative of the helpful and public-spirited manner in which its proposal to take o\ er the Medical Information Service was met by the Association and especially by Dr. G. C. Anderson, the Secretary. The Council will continue to work in close co-operation with the Association. Under the newly-made arrange ments, the work of the Medical Information Service will be widened, and it will be possible to deal in a more comprehensive manner than hitherto with the general publicising of British medical achievement abroad. (j) Students. With the collaboration of the Cambridge Board of Extra Mural Studies, a Vacation Course was held in Cambridge from the 16th July to the 6th August under the auspices of the Council. It was attended by 110 students from twenty different countries, seventy-two of whom were brought to this country by the Council. The remainder were students coming within the classification of “ Resident Foreigners ” and Government students from the Near Eastern \ countries. The course was residential and the students both lived and studied in Newnham College. As a result of invitations issued to various countries, it is now expected that eleven students will be coming to England from six different countries. Of these students, five have already arrived. Two Icelandic students of Commerce have already arrived in England. Two scholarships have been awarded to Icelandic medical students, and, in addition, a grant has been made to an Icelandic nurse already in this country to enable her to complete her studies. The Council has been in negotiation with the Ministry of Health with a view to arranging that temporary permission be granted to Icelandic medical students to practise in this country. Such medical students would formerly have gone to Germany or Denmark for their post-graduate training. At the request of the Afghan Minister, the Council will administer on behalf of the Afghan Government funds for M. Amini, an Afghan Government student for whom arrangements have been made to study economics at Glasgow. The Council have also made arrangements for thirty-two Turkish Govern ment engineering students to be placed in appropriate universities and technical colleges. Twelve students whose scholarships have ended have been placed in employ ment, some in positions which are of direct service to the war effort. Five Maltese18 and one Cypriot have been appointed teachers in schools under the Middlesex County Council Committee. Dr. Rzoska, a Council research scholar from Poland working at the Bureau of Animal Population at Oxford University, has had his services recognised by the Agricultural Research Council, who have agreed to enable him to continue his studies. Mr. Jabra, a British Council bursar from Palestine, has been awarded a Palestine Government Scholarship which will enable him to continue his studies at Cambridge. Dr. Muller, a former Council scholar from Brazil, writes from the University of Rio de Janeiro, where he is organising the first post-graduate course ever held in that university. Two of the' British Council Greek research scholars were present at the British Association Conference on Science and World Order. During the session 1941-42 eighty-five students from twenty-six countries will be continuing or commencing their studies in this country under the auspices of the Council at British universities or technical colleges.

It is encouraging to note that requests for hooks in Simple English and for books about the Enited Kingdom are now being received in greater numbers from foi eign nationals of all categories who a year ago only asked for books in their own language. 7. Lectures. The need for lecturers and lantern lectures is increasing rapidly throughout the country. Endeavours are being made to create panels of reliable lecturers on subjects relating to British Life and Institutions and to have available a greater selection, create a larger and more varied stock, of lantern slides and scripts. A six weeks course of lectures on British Life and Institutions has been arranged during the summer for the Polish Military Bureau in Edinburgh for Polish Officers and civilians, the cost being shared by the Council and the War Office. f 1 ) Including Gibraltarian centres.- 21 8 . A rt Exhibitions. The Allied Art Exhibition closed in Edinburgh on the 30th July. Approxi mately 40,000 people visited the exhibition during its stay. It is now being toured, under the auspices of the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts. At Glasgow it was seen by 24,000 persons, and it is now on view in Liverpool. It is hoped that a London season can be arranged under the joint auspices of the Council and C.E.M.A. The Council’s officer in Newcastle has given much help in connexion with an Exhibition of Norwegian Arts and Handi crafts which 1,400 persons visited in the first ten days. 9.

On each occasion the Council’s Regional Officer of London and East Anglia made a speech. In addition, a number of conceits have been held throughout the country m co-operation with C.E.M.A. Various celebrations in connexion with the Dvorak Centenarv have been arranged, in particular at the Czechoslovak Institute in London. 10 . Hospitality. (ci) It has been possible to arrange for some groups of Allied merchant seamen to be invited to country houses in large parties. Such invitations are much appreciated, as they a fiord the seamen an opportunity of seeing somethin 0, of the British Isles other than the dock areas. Extensions of this scheme are being considered in a general report which is being prepared on individual and group hospitality. \b) The Council has been able to welcome groups of Allies who have succeeded in reaching this country in order to join their respective armed forces.

II—ACTIVITIES OVERSEAS (1) The British Empire and Mandated Territories Ne^^and Middle East Note —Palestine and Cyprus form part of the Middle East area administered by the Council’s Representative in the Middle East. The Council’s Representative in Aden and the Director of the Institute at Valletta report direct to London, although they depend on Cairo for certain routine and technical services. MALTA The British Institute has carried out its regular programme of activities, despite the intensification of air raids. 10 fixtures were held in January, when there were 263 air raid warnings, and included a lecture by H.E. the Governor. The Chief Justice, Dr. G. Borg, M.B.E., LL.D., spoke on “The Laws of England and Maltese Legislation.” The Director, Mr. W. R. L. Wickham, is adhering to the policy of keeping the Institute open and carrying on with the engagements as usual. He writes: ‘ ‘ The concert of entirely English music on the 7th went off very well and was much appreciated. There was a raid throughout, but local gun-fire only provided an obbligato to the last few bars of “ The 11354—5 [23758] Wasps ” and to the National Anthem. I do not like to interrupt these concerts, as we have a big audience to consider both in the Hall and, to the tune of some 25,000, on Rediffusion ” According to the latest report, there ware nearly 2,500 members. Surprisingly, attendances at fixtures have not diminished. Progress was made with the equipment of the Preparatory School of St. Edward’s College. Flores College has made a very gallant recovery from the damage inflicted by enemy action, though much of the main building is still uninhabitable. Father Hersey has continued his activities as Secretary-Instructor of the Boy Scouts Association, and on the 17th February a fortnightly series of “Scout Half-Hours,” consisting of talks and songs in English, was inaugurated. A Home Rover Crew, representative of the three Services, has been formed, and it includes Rovers from the Dominions. CYPRUS English Courses at the British Institutes at Nicosia, Famagusta, Kyrenia and Larnaca were resumed on the 8th January, and H.E. the Governor of Cyprus paid informal visits to the Institutes at Nicosia, Famagusta and Larnaca later in the month. At Nicosia about 330 members were in regular attendance, comprising 165 students, 145 club members and 20 library members. 17 lectures were held during the quarter and special entertainments for troops. In Mr. K. M. Willey’s absence, Mr. S. W. White has acted as Director. The smallest of the Cyprus Institutes, that at Kyrenia, has grown in influence and scope. Member ship was about 90, of whom 60 are student members. A new ladies’ class has been added, and there are now 9 classes, divided among 5 teachers. The number of students at Larnaca increased in January to 117, the total membership being now about 200. On the 10th January special classes were begun for members of the engineering section of the Cyprus Volunteer Forces. ADEN To give some relief to the Representative in the Middle East at Cairo, Aden and South West Arabia have been formed into a separate area. The Repre sentative in Aden, Colonel Lake, w r ill report direct to London, informing Cairo of all relevant matters of policy. Owing to the difficulty in communication, Aden will continue for the present to receive its material requirements from Cairo. Mr. L. H. S. Emerson, the new Director of the Institute Club, arrived in December. Mr. Madsen, who has been supervising the Institute’s activities pending Mr. Emerson’s arrival, has now T been appointed Assistant Director. Membership of the Institute has been increasing steadily, and on the 1st January, 1942, there were 361 members of the Aden Institute Club, of whom 209 were Arabs, 69 Indians, 49 Jews, 30 Europeans and 4 Somalis. During December, the last month for which detailed figures are obtainable, the total attendance for the month was 1,955, or an average B2 of 75 per day. The library has been extensively used; books were added to it which had been specially selected by Sir Bernard Reilly, and despatched from London. During November and December members of the Greek Navy and a number of ratings of the Royal Navy accepted an invitation to use the Club during their stay in Aden : they expressed their warm appreciation of the privilege. THE WEST INDIES Mr. F. D. Gray, who has had extensive experience in the Caribbean area over a number of years, has been appointed Representative in the West Indies, and will leave shortly to take up his appointment. At the request of the Governor of Jamaica the Council has agreed to meet the cost of an extension to the Junior Centre of the Jamaica Institute, Kingston, and find part of the salary for an Assistant Librarian. The Council will be represented on the Board of Governors of the Institute. WEST AFRICA The Representative in the Middle East and Mr. J. S. Bingley completed a tour of West Africa, where they have been making a survey of possible Council activities, and returned to Cairo. Miss Fegan, who has recently undertaken a tour of West Africa on behalf of the Carnegie Corpora tion to investigate the need for libraries in that area, has returned to England. Discussions are now pro ceeding, in conjunction with the Colonial Office, as to the parts which the Corporation and the Council respectively can play in satisfying the library needs of West Africk. PALESTINE British Institute, Haifa The attendance figures for students at this Institute remain fairly constant. In January there were 116 students, of whom 42 were Arabs and 74 Jews. British Institute, Jaffa At this Institute there were 87 students and 51 club members in January, these figures including women members. The Institute now has a typing class and a class in English for Poles. An Arabic concert was one of the most popular items in the club programme. Mrs. Tucker, the Director’s wife, continues her successful work with the women of Jaffa. She has organised classes for hospital nurses and school mistresses. In February, a special showing of A.R.P. films was arranged for the women members of the Institute. British Institute, Nablus Of the 77 students attending the Institute in January 89 were women, and of the 172 club members 16 were women. In this month an annexe was opened to relieve congestion in the Institute. The District Officer gave a talk in Arabic on social evils, and a talk entitled “ Raiders Passed ” by Mr. Shields, of the Government of Palestine Education Depart ment, was much appreciated. The Council’s films continued to be shown to interested audiences, and during the quarter a number have been loaned to the Arab cinema in Nablus. The chief event of the period under review was a conference at the Institute of local schoolmasters. The conference was divided up into two sessions. 82 teachers from villages in the Nablus sub-district and a few from Jenin and Tulkarun attended the session for village teachers, at which the subjects for discussion were “ Hygiene in Schools' and 'School Gardens.” Mr. Hogben of the Education Department was present at the session for teachers of English, which was attended by about 40 teachers. British Institute, Nazareth The Institute opened in February. Mr. Radley, the Director, reports that it meets a real need and that it is likely there will be a demand for a women’s section, which Mrs. Radley will be able to organise. The Jenin Club, for which Mr. Radley is responsible, makes satisfactory progress. (2) Foreign Countries (a) Europe U.S.S.R. The plans put forward by the Council for the exchange of scientific information between British and Soviet scientists were communicated to the Soviet Government and passed on by them to the appropriate scientific institutions in the U.S.S.R. A list of scientific periodicals suitable for despatch to institu tions in the U.S.S.R. was prepared and the Council agreed at the request of the Anglo-Soviet Public Relations Association to act as a clearing house for the exchange of such periodicals with Soviet publica tions and as an agency for their supply. In the United Kingdom, Soviet seamen continued to visit certain of the centres in which the Council is interested. ICELAND The English classes given by Mr. Jackson at Reykjavik University have proved so popular that the Rector has decided to appoint a permanent Icelandic teacher of English to supplement the Representative’s activities. The Anglia Society has had its most successful season and it has been found necessary to take the largest hotel room in Reykjavik for its meetings. There has been a considerable increase in the number of Icelandic members. In addition to regular public lectures, four lectures a week are given to commercial students of the Law Department at Reykjavik University. Mr. Jackson has continued to take an active part in the organisation of daily broadcasts in English and he also broadcasts a weekly news summary over the Icelandic System. All these broadcasts appear to attract the majority of Icelandic listeners. PORTUGAL The purchase of the new premises for the British Institute in Portugal, the Menino D’Ouro Palace, has been completed, but the necessary alterations Jiave yet to be undertaken. At the end of March thlStal membership of the Institute was 1,717. 840 students were enrolled for the second term of the academic year. Additional grants have been made to St. Julian’s School, Carcavellos, towards the cost of educating British and foreign refugee children. Mr. J. B. 0. Durell has been appointed Lecturer in English at the British Institute in Lisbon; and Mr. Philippe Newman has now taken up his position as Professor of Violin at the Lisbon Conservatoire of Music. The Council is helping to entertain Lt. Antonio de Aguiar, who has been sent to this country by the Portuguese Government to follow a course in aero nautics. Professor Ifor Evans visited the British Institute, Lisbon, at the beginning of January on his way to Madrid. SPAIN The number of students and new members at the Madrid Institute increased by nearly 80 per cent, during the past term. The new members have, to8 a considerable extent, been attracted by the outstand ing success of the English Print Exhibition in March, which brought hundreds of leading Spaniards to the Institute. Fourteen lectures were delivered at the Institute during the quarter, and numerous film shows and play readings and the normal social and other functions took place. Professor If or Evans went to Madrid in January to make a general inspection of the Institute. Mrs. Carmen Wiggin left the Council’s London Office in March to take up her appointment as Secre tary Organiser at the Institute. Mr. F. L. Tofield has been appointed locally as a Lecturer in English at the Institute. SWEDEN Mr. Ronald Bottrall, the Representative of the Council, has lectured to the members of ten pro vincial branches of the Anglo-Swedish Society during the quarter, meeting with an enthusiastic reception in every town both from the local members and from the press. A new branch of the Anglo-Swedish Society has been opened at Linkoping. It has been necessary to double the staff at the Stockholm office. Mr. Charlesworth has been appointed as an Asaf^nt to Mr. Bottrall. He will visit, and lecture in, Workers’ Institutes in the provinces. The Council, through Mr. Bottrall, is endeavour ing to reduce to some extent the shortage of English books in Sweden. Preliminary steps have already been taken to organise the Council’s Summer School as well as ‘ ‘ English weeks ’ ’ and refresher courses for English teachers in Stockholm and the provinces. The Chairman broadcast to Sweden on the 20th March. (b) The Middle East EGYPT Mr. K. M. Willey, Director of the British Institute, Nicosia, Cyprus, and formerly an Inspector of Schools under the Board of Education, began an inspection of schools in the Middle East area con trolled or assisted by the Council. At the British Evening Institute in Cairo there were 687 students in January, as compared with 586 a year ago. The programme for the quarter included performances of a number of one-act plays, lectures, debates, film shows, &amp;c. A series of lectures entitled “An Outline of Modern Knowledge’’ was started. Tlv^nusical events included a recital of English songs and concerts of gramophone records. At the beginning of February a most successful exhibition of large photographs of Britain was held in the Institute. It was commented on very favourably by the Egyptian press. At the Alexandria Institute there were 440 students as compared with 370 the year before. Dr. L. R. Phillips, formerly Director of the English Depart ment at the Turk Maarif Cemiyeti Lycee, Ankara, became Director in the place of Mr. H. S. Deighton, who was appointed Professor of Modern History at the Fuad-al-Awal University. The Science and the Economics Societies met regularly, and several concerts were given. At the Mansura Institute there were 50 students and 58 club members. An Economics Society and a Dramatic Society were started. The first debate of the session drew nearly 100 people. The pro gramme of lectures included one on the Aswan Dam by a Civil Engineer, Riad Eff. Issak, and one by the Archimandrite, Father Athanasius Yousef Hanna, on his experiences in Syria and the Lebanon. [23758] In January there were 85 students at the Tanta Institute and 60 club members. The Institute Dramatic Society began to rehearse two plays. The Council’s films were shown in the Institute to large numbers. There were 40 students and 42 club members at the Assiut Institute. A number of the lectures given during the quarter were by Egyptians. Students at the Zagazig Institute in January numbered 53 and club members 85. The usual full programme of lectures, play-reading and debates was arranged, and a number of the Council’s films were shown each month. In the month of January 63 students and 84 club members attended the Mehalla Institute and a club Committee was formed which proved to be a popular development and the source of many useful sugges tions for running the social activities of the Institute. Of the lectures, Mp. Colin Baly’s lecture on Archaeology was the most applauded. In January there were 75 students and 62 club members at the Institute at Minia. A lecture, which attracted many of the local doctors, was given by the chief doctor at the Government Hospital, Dr. Riad Morcos. A number of the women members paid visits to a Cotton Ginning factory and to Tuna- el-Gabal. IRAQ In January 96 students attended classes in English at the Baghdad Institute and the average number of club members present at lectures and other functions w r as 150. The Institute was fortunate to secure the orchestras of various British Service Units stationed in Iraq, and throughout the quarter piano forte recitals were given. The ladies’ At Homes were held each week and there were occasionally special evening receptions, in the course of which films were shown. During the quarter some 40 British troops took lessons in Arabic at the Institute. Mr. Tett, the Director of the new Institute at Mosul, reported that five classes started at the beginning of February, premises for the Institute having been obtained after considerable effort. 35 students registered for ordinary classes in English and 37 schoolmasters for special teachers’ classes. ERITREA Two reports were received from Mr. C. R. Hewer, whose detailed plans for the formation of a British Institute at Asmara are being considered. TURKEY The Council deeply regret to record the death at Istanbul from typhoid fever of William Francis Crum. William Crum entered the Council’s service in August 1940, as Lecturer in English at Salonica, and was transferred to Turkey in April 1941. In addition to giving regular Courses at the Yildiz Technical School, the Istiklal Lycee and the Sariyer Halkevi, at Istanbul, he had achieved distinction by making translations from the Turkish and contribut ing to the English supplement of RSalitS, and was one of the most promising of the younger members of the Council’s staff in Turkey. Branch offices of the Council have been established at Istanbul and Smyrna, and Messrs. Lucas, Thompson and Lake have been appointed Directors of Council work at Ankara, Istanbul and Smyrna respectively. Tours of Turkey by the Council Repre sentative and members of the Council’s staff have resulted in the extension of the Council’s activities in the provinces. c*4 Increased interest has been shown in the Council’s work by prominent Turkish personalities, in particular by the President of the Republic and the Foreign Minister. The Minister of Education, Hasan Ali Yiicel, who has continued to receive English lessons from a member of the Council staff, in his reply to the letter from the former President of the Board of Education, Mr. Ramsbotham, referred with warm approval to the work and aims of the Council in Turkey. In his letter the Minister en closed an article by himself on Turkish education, which was published in the Times Educational Supplement of the 7th February. Reports received from Turkey on the English courses organised by the Council show that during the period October-December 1941, 2,899 pupils were taught, of whom 775 were in higher or technical educational institutions, 905 in secondary schools, 928 (mostly adults) in Halkevleri, 129 in Govern ment Departments, including banks, and 162 in the armed forces. English courses were held in 42 Turkish institutions situated in Ankara, Istanbul, Smyrna and 8 other provincial towns. New develop ments included the inauguration of classes at the Commercial High School and the Galatasaray Govern ment Lycee at Istanbul, and at the “sub-capital” of Biga, which is situated in a military zone, normally inaccessible to travellers. The Council was also responsible for English courses in 9 non-Turkish schools. It co-operated in this work with the American Commercial Institutes in Istanbul. All these classes were run by a staff of 16 teachers appointed from London and about 17 locally appointed teachers. The Head of the American Lycee for Boys at Istanbul has written of the Council’s staff as follows :— ‘ ‘ Nothing seems to be too much trouble for them and they are always willing to help out. They seem to travel all over this city wherever they are needed and can be of help. I am very glad that they are here and want you to know that they seem to be taking their work most seriously and doing very good jobs.” During the quarter under review the Council’s teaching of English in Halkevleri has been extended to seven further towns, namely Sivas, Kayseri, Giresum, Edirne (all provincial capitals), Buleir, Soke and Mustafakemalpasa. This brings the total number of Halkevleri in which the Council is pro viding English teaching to 25, the others being at Ankara, Istanbul (5), Smyrna (8), Aydin, Biga, Bornova, Canakkale, Manisa, Mersin, Nazilli (2), and Samsun. The total number of pupils learning English in these institutions exceeds 1,000. The Council’s teachers are now giving lessons in three “Banks” (industrial bureaux) other than the four in which classes were started earlier. Three Army and Air Force classes, one in each of the principal cities, have been maintained, and Council staff have continued to teach at three Technical and three Agricultural High Schools, five Lycees, two press offices, the Conservatoire, and three Faculties. At Istanbul University, the Faculties of Letters and Science have elected to the Chair of Byzantine History and Art and the Chair of Astronomy respec tively the Hon. J. C. S. Runciman, formerly Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Dr. S. Royds, who has been director of British and Indian Observatories. Professor Runciman has already arrived at Istanbul and inaugurated his two courses of lectures. Drs. A. K. Mcllwraith, V. H. Legg and P. du Val, respectively, Professors of English, Industrial Chemistry and Mathematics, have estab lished close contact with their colleagues and pupils. Dr. du Val succeeded in lecturing in Turkish two and a half months after his arrival. The total number of the Counfcil’s Turkish pupils is at present about 8,200, the latest being the son of the President of the Republic. A member of the British Forces’ football team, which visited Turkey from Cairo in November- December 1941, has been appointed trainer 'to the Fenerbahce Club, Istanbul, so that there are now three British football trainers in Turkey appointed by the Council. Galatasaray Club, where one of them has been established for a year, has won the Turkish football cup. A notable feature of the quarter was the establish ment by the People’s party in Turkey of a Halkevi (“People’s House”) in London. It was opened on the 19th February at 14, Fitzhardinge Street, W. 1, by the Turkish Ambassador, in the presence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. The Council assisted the Turkish Embassy in the organisation of this Halkevi, which is the first to be opened outside Turkey. The Halkevi Committee has drawn up a full programme of activities and lectures, of which the first was given on the 24th March by M. S. Ozbekkan, Commercial Attache to the r £^:kish Embassy, on “Modern Turkey.” Favourable comments on this exceptional event have appeared in the Turkish press, the doyen of whose editors described it as the most important event that has yet occurred in Anglo-Turkish relations. (c) Ibero-America Sir Eugen Millington Drake, K.C.M.G., has been seconded by the Foreign Office for service as the Council’s Chief Representative for Spanish-speaking America. Mr. H. H. Brissenden has been seconded by the Board of Education in order that he may become Deputy Chief Representative for the same area. Sir Eugen and Mr. Brissenden are well-known authorities on cultural and educational relations with the countries of Spanish-speaking America. The keen interest taken by Sir Eugen in the Council’s work during his term of service as His Majesty’s Minister at Montevideo was acknowledged in the Report for the third quarter of 1941. Mr. Brissenden served in 1939—40 as Educational Adviser to His Majesty’s Embassy at Buenos Aires and while in South America investigated Educational questions in ChiltVmd Uruguay. It should be noted that this quarter includes the vacation period in most of the countries. The majority of Institutes, &amp;c., were closed during January and February. ARGENTINA The impressive Annual Report for 1941 of the Asociacion Argentina de Cultura Inglesa at Buenos Aires acknowledges the support of the Council, who have continued their supplies of books, periodicals and films. The Asociacion Rosarina de Cultura Inglesa at Rosario have moved to new premises and have held successful summer classes. They expect to start the new year with 500 members and 200 students. Professor Edgar Adrian, Professor of Physiology at Cambridge University, visited Buenos Aires in March on behalf of the Council. BRAZIL Professor Radcliffe-Brown and Mr. J. B. Keenan (see Report for fourth quarter of 1941) have arrived in Brazil.5 „ j A new Anglo-Brazilian Cultural Society has been founded in Curityba, principal city of the State of Parana, with the energetic support of the Interventor of the State and the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters in the University. Another Society is about to be launched in Santos, the port of San Paulo. Reports covering the last quarter of 1941 have been received from the Directors of the Societies at Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte. At Rio, over 1,400 students registered for inclusion in the Society’s English classes (against 1,100 in 1940). The programme includes some interesting innova tions made by Mr. Francis Toye, the new Director. At Sao Paulo, 2,200 students registered, as com pared with 1,850 in the previous year. It is interesting to note that the percentage of elementary classes, which was 80 in 1989, has now fallen to 60. Among the Society’s social activities must be mentioned one particularly enterprising effort, a production in the Municipal Theatre of “ Richard of Bordeaux ” by members of the Drama Club, under the direction of Miss Smallbones. At Belo Horizonte, the number of students registered was 240. A series of talks by the Director on contemporary life in England attracted consider able interest. CHIL. Two additional teachers have arrived in Chile to take up appointments in British Schools at Santiago and Valparaiso. The Chilean-British Institute at Santiago has started two interesting new experiments in the form of Extra-Mural classes and broadcast English lessons. The Honorary Co-ordinator of the Council’s work reports that classes on the study of English culture are now being conducted in sixteen centres in Chile. COLOMBIA To the three new appointments to the Council’s staff in Colombia reported under “ Teaching Appoint ments ” must be added the transfer of Mr. Douglas Kerlogue to Colombia from Peru, where he w T as Assistant Director of the Anglo-Peruvian Cultural Association. CUBA Books have been presented to St. George’s School, Havana. PARAGUAY The Council has asked Mr. J. H. Stevens to org^^se classes for local teachers of English, and to givt, further classes, to which the general public will be admitted, in premises leased through His Majesty’s Legation for the purpose. VENEZUELA The first report on the Instituto Cultural Anglo- Venezolano shows that an impressive start has been made under the guidance of the Director, Professor James Smith. Opened at the end of November, the Institute has nearly 800 students, who are divided into fourteen classes. Groups of students from certain Venezuelan Government Departments and other public bodies attend these classes. The public meetings so far held include the opening ceremony, a lecture given by Sir Eugen Millington- Drake on his way back to this country, two lectures by Professor Entwistle and a reception given for the Agrupacion Cultural Venezolana. (d) Other Countries BELGIAN CONGO The preparation of the new British Institute in Leopoldville had advanced considerably by December [23758] last, when the Representative, Mr. F. Y. Thompson, was unfortunately taken seriously ill. He is expected to return to work shortly. Mr. G. Humphreys Roberts was sent from Cairo to take charge in Mr. Thompson’s absence. On the latter’s return He will remain as Assistant Lecturer. English classes have been continued and important contacts made in several provincial centres. An English weekly programme has been organised by courtesy of the Belgian Congo Radio Authorities. Great assistance has been given to the Council’s Representative by the Belgian Authorities and popu lation. CHINA Dr. E. R. Hughes, Reader in Chinese Religion and Philosophy at Oxford, who left England in February for China, has been asked by the Council to make certain investigations there on its behalf. The Council has taken part in a scheme whereby, as soon as travel facilities are available, Chinese Research students will be sent to this country by the Chinese Government. A number of free places for such students have been promised by the Univer sities, and the Council has offered, as a start, to maintain 10 of the students brought here under this scheme. Provision has been made for the continuance of grants to the Sino-British Cultural Association, for book presentations to societies and institutes, for an increase in the grant to the Federation of British Industries in respect of their scheme for bringing student apprentices from China to Britain, and for a new grant in connexion with the establishment of English classes in Chungking and Kunming. The Council has approved the suggestion of His Majesty’s Embassy that the grant previously made to Hong Kong University for scholarships for students from the interior of China should, in present circum stances, be applied to the extension of the teaching of English in Free China. Ill—ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (1) Appointments to Staff Mr. Edwin Muir, Assistant to Scottish Regional Officer, Edinburgh. Mr. J. Pearson, Director, Allied Centre, Liverpool. Mrs. Ursula Beck, Part-time assistant, Oxford. (2) Teaching of English During the past quarter 14 teachers of English have been appointed to the Polish, Czech and Belgian armies and the Netherlands brigade. In addi tion, valuable assistance has been given by the local Education Authorities and the W.E.A. in pro viding part-time teachers in country districts. In some ports, notably Cardiff, Liverpool and New castle, classes in English for Allied merchant seamen have become well established. (8) Films Regular programmes of films were provided as follows :— IC.Q No. of pro grammes. Civilians 67 Merchant Seamen . 145 Allied Airmen 68 Allied Convalescent Homes and Hospitals 10 Allied Naval Units . 26 Polish School 18 Gibraltarian Centres 45 Total 374 j-W» 6 (4) Books and Periodicals Some of the Council’s pamphlets on British Life and Institutions and selected Oxford University Press pamphlets have been translated into the languages of the Allies and will soon be published. In some areas a system of circulating libraries between the different centres has been introduced, so that the books available may be read by the maximum number of people. In the Newcastle area a scheme has been devised by the Council’s Officers whereby all members of the Allied forces and British subjects from the Colonies (mainly seamen) admitted to hospitals in the area will receive suitable reading matter. (5) Lectures Apart from those given regularly at National Houses and other centres, lectures have been given to special groups of members of the Allied armies. The Council’s Officers have encouraged informal debates for the exchange of ideas on British Life and Institutions. Lecture notes prepared by the Council are in constant demand and an additional series of such notes is at present in production. Two lectures given by Mr. E. L. Woodward on “British Foreign Policy’’ to a Polish Military audience were so much appreciated that they have been translated into Polish for publication in the Polish Military Journal Bellona. Throughout the quarter lectures were supplied every week to courses organised at the Polish Military Bureau, Edinburgh. The Council arranged for various Allied speakers to address units of the British army, and many other similar requests have been referred to the Allied Governments concerned. (6) Exhibitions The Czechoslovak Army Exhibition “ Czecho slovakia—Land of Ancient Culture and Modern Civilisation’’ was opened at the National Gallery of Scotland, under the patronage of the Council, by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, in the presence of a number of Czechoslovak Ministers of State and the Chairman of the Council. The Exhibition was visited by 1,000 people daily during the month it remained in Edinburgh. It was later transferred to Manchester. An exhibition of Polish photographs, “ Through Polish Eyes,’’ was opened in March in Edinburgh. This, too, was under the patronage of the Council. A very successful Anglo-Yugoslav Week was held in Cambridge from the Brd to 10th March. It was initiated by a local Committee, but to some extent financed and assisted by the Council. His Majesty King Peter, Queen Marie, several members of the Yugoslav Government and the Chairman of the Council took an active part in the manifestation. The programme included two Art Exhibitions, for both of which the Council’s Fine Art Department made most of the arrangements. (7) Concerts At the request of the Belgian Government the Council arranged for the London Belgian Quartet to play in a large number of University towns in the United Kingdom. The Universities generously pro vided hospitality. The Prime Minister of Belgium has expressed to the Council his gratitude for its assistance. The band of the Royal Netherlands Brigade made a tour of North-Eastern England under the auspices of the Council. In eight days the band played to 17,500 people; the audiences included Civil Defence workers, shipyard workers, munition workers, British Military and R.A.F. personnel and miners. In addi tion, the band took part in the Newcastle Warship Week, where it was given the place of honour when the First Lord of the Admiralty took the salute. (8) Private Hospitality A meeting, attended by representatives of National Voluntary Associations, was held in January at the Council to discuss the provision of hospitality in British homes for Service personnel and merchant seamen from the Dominions, Colonies, India and Allied countries. The Council has agreed to collect, and to circulate by means of a leaflet, information on the hospitality available for members of the Allied Forces on leave. The Council’s Officers throughout the United Kingdom encouraged the formation of local Hospitality Committees, who would enable Allied visitors to receive hospitality in British homes. (9) Professional Contacts The Council gives constant thought to the means by which Allied nationals of particular professions can meet their British colleagues. Such activities are arranged especially for members of the Forces. For example, schoolmasters now serving with the Royal Netherlands Brigade were invited to Birmingham to visit English schools, and were received by the Vice- Chancellor of the University and the Director of Education. Lawyers now serving with the Belgian Czechoslovak and Netherlands Brigades were^^ter- tained by barristers and solicitors in Birmingham, and at a lunch in their honour Lord Snell, Vice- Chairman of the Council, presided, and Mr. Justice Cassels and Mr. Justice Hallet were among the guests. Distinguished representatives of the Czechoslovak, Netherlands, Norwegian and Polish Governments and the Free French National Committee were enabled by the Council to make a ten days’ tour to Edin burgh, Birmingham and London, to study Social Welfare work. The tour was admirably arranged by the British Association of Residential Settlements. The President of the Board of Education was the guest of honour at a reception arranged by the Council for Ministers of Education of the Allied Governments on the 9th February. The reception was attended by about 800 British and Allied Educa tionalists.

Two play readings and visits to Shakespeare plays were arranged, and in addition a concert was given for evacuees from the Channel Islands.8 (18) Armed Forces Allied Air Units Regional Officers of the Council continue to make visits to R.A.F. stations, often in the company of Air Ministry officials, to discuss questions affecting the education and entertainment of Allied airmen. Allied Navies The Council has carried out miscellaneous activities in consultation with the Admiralty. Allied Armies. Books and periodicals have been supplied to nearly all units concerned. The Council has taken special steps to supply professional journals in order to enable men serving in the Allied armies to keep in touch with their peace-time occupations and to gain a knowledge of British methods. The Council has arranged to supply films to all Allied units. American Units Some contact has been made with the American forces and various facilities for the American Civilian Technical Corps have been provided in Scotland and elsewhere. Dominion Forces The Council consulted the appropriate authorities of the Canadian, Newfoundland, New Zealand and South African forces to ascertain in what ways the facilities available through the Council could best be put at the disposal of Dominion forces in the United Kingdom. Mr. Michael Huxley has generously offered to help the Council, in an honorary capacity, to make a survey of the needs of the Canadian forces. Colonies The establishment of an Islamic Centre at Cardiff has now been approved and constructional work is in hand. Literature and facilities have been supplied to Moslems in South Shields and various other activities, including a course of lectures on British life and institutions, have been organized at West Indies House, Newcastle, for West Indian and West African seamen. Indian Trainees Reading matter and facilities for excursions to London and elsewhere have been provided at the reception centre in Letch worth.

In Birmingham the Indian trainees have been entertained by. the Guild of Undergraduates and the Birmingham Trades Council. Evacuees from Gibraltar The Council continually provides educational facili ties and entertainment at the thirty Gibraltarian centres in the London area. Pioneer Corps At the request of the War Office the alien companies of the Pioneer Corps have been visited, and reading matter and other facilities have been provided. IV—FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES (a) Books and Periodicals The Council’s activities with regard to books and periodicals have so increased in extent and complexity that it has been found advisable to separate, for administrative purposes, the non-commercial and the commercial sides of the work. A new Department, known as the Export (Publica tions) Department, has therefore been formed under the charge of Mrs. M. Fernald to promote the commercial distribution of British books (and to a certain extent of British periodicals) overseas. This Department deals with the Book Export Scheme, Book Subsidy Schemes, Exhibitions and Book Reviews, and with transactions in translation rights and serial rights whenever these are undertaken for commercial purposes. The Books and Periodicals Department continues to deal with everything concerning the presentation of books and periodicals, in the Empire, in foreign countries and among Empire and foreign residents in Britain; with all the Council’s own publications in book and pamphlet form (but not in periodical form); and with any question affecting British books and periodicals in general. This Department, with Mr. John Hampden as Director, now comprises a Books Section (Mrs. D. A. Ormrod), Periodicals Section (Mr. J. O’N. Fisher) and Publications Section (Miss Lang). BOOK PRESENTATIONS Notable among the activities this quarter was the preparation of two libraries for Addis Ababa : a Reference Library for the use of the Emperor and Government of Ethiopia, which included, besides many standard works of reference, extensive selec tions of books on international law, diplomacy, British systems of central and local government, education, public health, agriculture, transport, engineering, &amp;c.; the other a popular lending library of English fiction and general literature. As usual, the Council secured expert assistance in the work of selection—in this case from Ethiopians in Britain, English people who know the country and authorities on the various subjects. A request for scientific, agricultural and educational works in general for libraries in Costa Rica provided an opening for introducing English books into that country. During 1941 the number of English libraries in Costa Rica rose from five to thirteen and it is the President’s intention to have an English library in each of the 62 districts before the end of 1944. The Council has sent English text-books to the value of about £500 to Colombia to meet for the time being the deficiency in teaching material. The despatch of a number of illustrated booW^on British sport to Oporto some time ago has resultba in the inauguration of a small English Reading Circle for Portuguese sportsmen in that town, and in a request for additional books on similar subjects. The increasing shortage of paper, and the transfer of skilled labour from the book world in general and from the printing and binding trades, have made it much more difficult for the Council to deal promptly and adequately with requests for books. New publications are liable to go out of print immediately they appear, and many standard works on all subjects, indispensable educational books, and editions of classics in such series as Everyman’s Library are no longer available. This is a very serious handicap to the Council’s work, and though the Department has made every effort to deal with the situation it remains most unsatisfactory. Many second-hand books have been bought, however, and the Council has purchased the library of the English Association. The shortage of medical, scientific, technical and educational books is even more serious than that of general literature.- -—*- 0 PUBLICATIONS The first six International Guild Books, in Czech, Dutch, French, Greek, Norwegian and Polish, have been printed. Four more are ready for press, nine are with the printers and four are being translated. General and trade prospectuses are being printed. This series will be published for the Council by the British Publishers Guild, at Is. or 9d. net, in paper covers, and the Council hopes to issue the first set in May. It will distribute numerous copies at home and abroad. British Contributions to Persian Studies, by A. J. Arberry, will be published by Longmans Green at Is. net in May or June. British I rade Unions, by John Price, is in proof and is being revised by the author. British Agricultural Research: Rothamsted, by Sir E. John Russell, the first of the new series Science in Britain, is ready for press in English, and the Spanish and Portuguese editions are nearly ready. British Life and Thought (Longmans Green, 8s. 6d. net) is being revised for a second edition, and a number of the separate brochures have again been reprinted, including British Social Services, British Education, The Face of Britain and The British Co0to&gt;nwealth. Due Council has signed the Book Production War Economy Agreement and its publications will conform with this as regards type, paper and all details. BRITISH BOOK NEWS A more attractive cover and a more convenient and economical type-page have been adopted, as from the issue for January 1942, and the entries are now classi fied by subjects according to the Dewey Decimal Classification. A complete Index for 1941 (titles, authors and subjects) has been printed and will be sent free to any reader outside the United Kingdom who applies to the National Book Council, 8 Henrietta Street, London, W.C. 2. British Book News 1941, the bound volume com prising the year’s issues and the index, will be published for the National Book Council by r Longmans Green at 6s. net in April or May. BOOK LISTS National Book Council Book Lists which have been sponsored and distributed by the Council during the quart-er include those on Agriculture, Nursing and Tra^|port. Lists on World History, Building Con- stru ^ion. Anthropology, Aeronautical Engineering, Automobile Engineering and other subjects are in preparation, and proposals for short annotated lists in a new form are being considered. British Civilisaticm and Institutions, the 86-page Book List, which was issued for the Council by the National Book Council, is being brought up to date and extended to include Medicine, Science and Engineering. It will be published about June 1942. periodicals The most outstanding features during the past few months have been the rapid increase in requests for specialised publications and the expansion of distri bution to Seamen’s Missions, Catholic Mission Schools and the Colonies. An indication of the value of the Council’s work in connexion with specialised publications is given in the letters received recently from English scientific organisations and museums, expressing their grati tude to the Council for enabling them to resume exchanges which had ceased owing to war conditions. Notable amongst these are the resumption of exchanges between the Turkish Historical Society and ten English counterparts; similar arrangements between three faculties of Stockholm University and a number of English societies with kindred interests; and medical exchanges between English publications and their counterparts in Sweden, Spain, Portugal, Turkey and various Universities in Latin America. Specialised material on agricultural subjects has also been supplied, in co-operation with the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux, to Spain, Portugal and other countries. From Iceland requests for periodicals on handi crafts, engineering and other technical subjects have been received, and letters of appreciation are already reaching us. A varied selection of general and technical publica tions has been sent for consideration in Ethiopia, and distribution has begun. Requests have been received from Catholic Mission Schools in French Equatorial Africa and the Belgian Congo; also from the Paris Mission Centres in French Equatorial Africa and the Cameroons, for handicraft and general periodicals, and great appreciation has already been expressed by various recipients. Among the publications distributed, to Institutes has been the special number of the British Association’s Advancement of Science, containing the report of the recent Conference on Science and World Order; and a special issue of the Studio, containing a description by the Director of the Fine Arts Depart ment of the Exhibition of British Arts and Crafts which he has organised for the U.S.A. BOOK EXPORT SCHEME Orders under the Book Export Scheme have been received this quarter to the gross value of £2,518. On previous orders, the sum of £931 7s. 3d. has been received, and has been paid into a special account pending the adjustment of publishers’ accounts. To date, 173 books have been returned under the sale or return clause of the scheme. BOOK EXHIBITIONS Books are being assembled for exhibitions in Madrid and Istanbul. A special exhibit is being despatched to the Smyrna Fair. The Text book exhibition, which has been sent to Colombia, will be sent subsequently to Ecuador. It has also been offered to Bolivia. BOOK REVIEWS This scheme appears to be achieving its object of making selected books more widely known to the foreign public and thereby creating a demand for them, since books sent out for review are beginning to be ordered under the Book Export Scheme. In Chile arrangements have been made for the broadcast review of two books a month. In Brazil, in addition to the usual monthly quota, the Council is sending books on local Government administration, taxation and legal subjects for review by a specialist in these subjects. In Spain, a new periodical, Revista Teologia, is being supplied with books on theology. translations There has been a steady stream of enquiries from foreign publishers and translators about translation rights. Requests for reading copies of books have come from Switzerland, Spain, Portugal and, in particular, Sweden. (b) “Britain To-day” Arrangements which have been made for printing the Spanish edition of Britain To-day (“ Inglaterra Modema”) in Buenos Aires took effect with the February number. The Argentine printers used ►10 moulds made in Great Britain and sent out by air mail. A similar arrangement, starting with the March number, has been made for the printing of a Portuguese edition in Bio de Janeiro. These changes enable Britain To-day to restrict its consump tion of home-made paper, and to speed up circulation hitherto delayed by slow sea transport. In New York the experiment is being made of offering Britain To-day for sale at 10 cents a copy, instead of distributing it free. (c) Drama Relations with the theatres of neutral countries continue to develop. In response to requests from various Swedish theatrical managements, the Council has sent out the texts of a number of new and recent productions of every description, with a view to their translation and performance in Sweden. Several children’s plays have been sent out at the request of the Sagoteatern (Children’s Theatre). Critiques of every play produced in London are sent out regularly for the information of Swedish managers. The Council has made a small grant to an English- speaking dramatic company which has been estab lished in Switzerland under the direction of Dr. Emil Oprecht, of the Stadttheater and Schauspielhaus, in Zurich. This company opened successfully with performances in English of Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion in Zurich, Bale, Geneva, Berne and Lausanne, and arrangements have been made to keep it supplied with British plays. A number of British plays have also been sent out for translation and production in Switzerland, and the Council has acted as intermediary in all negotiations for performing rights. Plays have also been sent to Brazil and Argentina for translation and performance. With the co-opera tion of the B.B.C. a large number of scripts of British radio plays have been sent to Chile for broadcasting in the English Hours in Santiago and Valparaiso. The Anglo-Uruguayan Cultural Institute has joined the British Drama League. Circulating libraries of plays for play-reading and acting circles are being supplied to all Anglophil Societies in Ibero-America. The practice continues of sending British plays to institutes, play-reading societies and dramatic clubs in Europe, Malta and the Near East. (d) Films NEW PRODUCTION (1) News-reels —British news continues to be regularly distributed every week to 30 British Colonies. (2) Documentaries —The following films were completed :— Teeth of Steel (Colour)—The work of modern excavating machines. Trinity House —England’s lightships and light houses. Gardens of England (Colour)—A survey of English gardens, great and small. Good Value —The high standard of British crafts manship. COMMENTARIES Commentaries are now being recorded in nine languages. DISTRIBUTION During the quarter G82 prints of Council films were despatched to 72 territories. Theatrical —222 prints for cinemas in 61 terri tories, of which some were duplicating prints. Non-Theatrical —460 prints to educational authori ties and other institutions in 38 territories. 104 of these 460 prints were added to the libraries of British Institutes and Anglophil Societies equipped with projectors. The following are extracts from some of the reports received during the last quarter :— Canada —The National Film Society has written, “ . . . .the demand for your films is steadily increasing ” From October to February this year there have been 1,087 screenings of Council films to audiences totalling 239,138 persons. Chile —A recent report states that 945 exhibitions of Council films were given during .1941 in schools and other educational institutions serviced by the Institute de Cinematografia Educativa, to whom 51 16-mm. prints were presented early last year. I r(l q —x n his monthly report the Director of the British Institute, Bagdad, states: “Films are still in demand by schools and colleges, and a weekly showing of British Council films has been arranged at the Palace for His Majesty King Faisal II.” St. Helena —The Information Officer writes : “ The 16-mm. films supplied to me have been worked hard on my portable cinema projector. I can use lots more if they are available. Audiences of 200 and 300 come long distances to see these films.” Antigua, West Indies —“ The managers oftfcoth cinemas in Antigua state that their patrons’ took forward with interest to seeing these films, and they have been much appreciated.” Bahamas—Colour in Clay, Royal Road, Out of the Night have been shown at three theatres for 12 performances to 3,518 persons. Hong Kong —In the last report received before the fall of the Island (that for October and November) it was stated that Council films had been shown to 26,000 persons in shows to garrisons. Tanganyika —The Information Officer says that Council films ‘ ‘ are circulated throughout the terri tory wherever a 16-mm. silent projector exists and where there is an individual willing and competent to exhibit the films ” (e) Fine Arts children’s exhibitions The success of these exhibitions held in Canada, United States and Brazil has proved to be remarkable, as the following extracts and translations from some hundreds of press notices will show :— The Christian Science Monitor —“Undoubtedly it is one of the most exciting exhibitions that ha^gver come to this country.” The Ottawa Citizen —“ There have been other collec tions of children’s paintings, of course, but none quite so * comprehensive or so well arranged as this.” O Estado de Sdo Paulo (Brazil)—“It is so big and so significant.” “ One of the best proofs of this interest so widespread is found in the expressions of unrestricted praise from our best art critics.” A Manha (Brazil)—“ The greatest proof of vitality that Great Britain could give to her friends in South America. ... It is a spectacle that moves us profoundly.” The exhibition was held at Bio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, where it drew 27,000 people in fourteen days, and subsequently at Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre and Curityba. From there it will be sent to Montevideo. ARTS AND CRAFTS The collection of over 700 exhibits, together with the Council’s organiser, Miss Bose, have safely reached New York, and the first of a series of Crafts Exhibitions will be opened at the Metropolitan Museum, New York, on the 20th May.EXHIBITION OF MODERN PAINTINGS FOR THE UNITED STATES Approximately 40 modern oils and water-colours have been selected and despatched to Toledo to complete the travelling exhibition referred to in the last report. The exhibition, after being successfully shown in St. Louis, is to visit Pittsburg, Cleveland and elsewhere. Professor John Rothenstein kindly wrote the prefatory note to the catalogue. EXHIBITION OF GRAPHIC ART IN BUENOS AIRES An exhibition of graphic art sent out by the Council will open on the 15th April in Buenos Aires, and later will visit many other centres in South America. EXHIBITION OF GRAPHIC ART IN MADRID The exhibition of prints and engravings was opened on the 1st of March in the British Institute. The Ambassadors and Ministers of seven countries and 400 other persons attended the opening cere mony. In five days no fewer than 85 works were sold—a record in the Council’s experience. A considerable number could have been sold many times over. The exhibition was said by the art critics to be the finest of its kind that Madrid had seen in rece nt^ years. It was crowded throughout and brou^Bmany influential Spaniards to the Institute. A competing exhibition was arranged by the Germans as soon as the date of the British exhibition became knowm. INTERNATIONAL SMYRNA FAIR Mr. Maxwell Ayrton, F.R.I.B.A., has designed the layout of the British Council’s Section at the Smyrna International Fair to be opened in August. (f) Lectures In co-operation with the Ministry of Information, the Council arranged to send a number of lecturers to Sweden. The first to go was Sir Kenneth Clark, who during March lectured on British Art in Stock holm, Gothenburg, IJpsala, Lund and Malmo. Mr. T. S. Eliot will go to Sweden in April to lecture on English Poetry. It has become possible to make arrangements for the sending of lecturers to Spain and Portugal. Pro fessor Bodkin will lecture on British Art in Madrid, Lisbon, Oporto and Coimbra during the month of April. During March Professor Edgar Adrian travelled und^fche Council’s auspices from the United States to Kienos Aires, where he lectured on scientific subjects. (g) Music Lord Glentanar has joined the Music Committee. PRESENTATIONS Colombia —Foundation libraries of gramophone records have been sent to Colombia for use in the Cultural Institutes. Uruguay —Records of modern orchestral music and scores have been sent for use by the “ S.O.D.R.E.” orchestra.

Chile —Part songs have been presented to the Concepcion Choir in Santiago. Sweden —Records of modern British works and chamber music works, vocal scores, choral works, scores of modern orchestral music and keyboard music from Byrd to Purcell, with madrigals and volumes of lutanist songs, have been sent for the use of musical societies, schools and universities. [23758] Spain—At the request of the Director of the Madrid Institute, the Council telegraphed to him a message, signed by many eminent British con ductors and composers, in praise of the late Fernandez Arbos. The message was read by the Director of the Institute as a large Memorial concert in Madrid, and the gesture was much appreciated by the Spaniards. An illuminated copy of the text of the message will be prepared and sent to Madrid. Portugal —The National Society of Chamber Music has arranged to give two concerts of British chamber works. The necessary music has been sent to the Society by the Council. The monthly supplies of dance music to band leaders in Portugal, Spain and Sweden have been maintained. (h) Press NEW FEATURES A new service called “ Facts about Britain is now provided weekly by the Press Division. It consists of a collection of statistics and short items of interest. A weekly sports feature has been introduced, as a result of a request from Turkey. It will eventually become a useful addition to the material issued to the Empire. SPECIAL REQUESTS The April number of The Asiatic Review will contain two articles, for which the Council s repre sentative in Turkey urged that publicity should be obtained in this country. A special selection of essays by young British writers has been made for the Council by Mr. John Lehmann, at the urgent request of His Majesty’s Ambassador in China, and forwarded to Chungking. On the occasion of the sixtieth birthday of the famous Swedish writer, Ludwig Nordstrom, messages were obtained from Mr. Hermon Ould, the Inter national Secretary of the P.E.N. Club, and from Sir Adrian Boult, and forwarded to Stockholm. Three special articles were prepared for an Easter number of The Anglo-Swiss Times. PUBLICITY The Chairman has broadcast a most successful talk on the work of the Council to Sweden. An article by the Chairman on the work of the British Council is to be published in the second issue of the special British-American number of The Imperial Review. In addition to some 550 news items in the home press, and some 800 insertions .which have reached the Council from the Empire and foreign press, the following articles on the Council’s work appeared in the British .press during the quarter The British Institute in Madrid : Times Educational Supplement, 7th March, 1942. Turkey’s Interest in British Culture : Times Educa tional Supplement, 28rd March, 1942. Propaganda : News Review, 19th February, 1942. Spreading British Culture : The Star, 21st January, 1942.

VISITS Professor Manuel de Gonzalez Montesinos, a Mexican journalist and University professor, arrived on the 24th January for a three months’ visit as the suest of the Council. Senor Montesinos has met a O D*number of important persons here. He has twice broadcast to Mexico, and written a number of excellent articles and interviews. During the week' beginning the 28rd March he paid a visit to Scotland. Invitations have been issued to a party of six Brazilian editors and to other Latin American journalists to visit this country as the Council’s guests. STAFF. Mr. Lindsay Shankland, ex-R.A.F. and A.T.A. pilot, formerly attached to the Public Relations Office of British Airways, joined the staff of the Council on the 2nd February, in order to take the place of Mr. Colin Mann, who is awaiting call-up to the Navy. (i) Science (including Medicine) (a) PURE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING The members of the Science Committee heard with profound regret of the death of their Chairman, Sir William Bragg. He had been very active on behalf of the Council and the Committee, and only four days before his death he took part in the tenth consecutive broadcast in the series : Science Lifts the Veil, whose theme he proposed, and whose execu tion he supervised. Sir William gave the first talk himself, and introduced the next nine speakers. In two of the talks he held dialogues with the speakers. The first of these was with Dr. C. D. Darlington, on the subject Life's Workshop: Cells, Chromosomes and Heredity. The second dialogue was with Professor J. D. Bernal, on Living Crystals, and the Problem of the Origin of Life, and this proved to contain Sir William’s last address to the world. On the 23rd March Sir William introduced his son’s talk on X-Rays and Metals. Other speakers in the series were Professor Allan Ferguson, Dr. C. F. A. Pantin, Sir Robert Robinson (who spoke twice), Professor J. Kendall, Dr. W. T. Astbury, Professor J. D. Cockcroft, Dr. T. E. Alli- bone and Professor P. M. S. Blackett. The B.B.C. has informed the Council that the Egyptian State Broadcasting Company have applied for the scripts for this series, for translation into Arabic and rebroadcasting from Egypt. The South African Broadcasting Company is re-diffusing the talks in South Africa, and the scripts of the talks are being published in London Calling, the Overseas journal of the B.B.C. The Council has provided scripts for eight science talks in the B.B.C. South American service in Spanish and Portuguese. The authors of the scripts and the subjects are :— Sir William Bragg : The Royal Institution. Sir Joseph Barcroft: A Physiologist in the Andes. Sir Edward Appleton : The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in Britain. Dr. C. F. A. Pantin : Life in the Sea. Professor A. Y. Hill: The Royal Society. Dr. F. W. Aston : The Cavendish Laboratory. Sir Harold Scott: British Activities in Research con nected with Tropical Medicine. Sir Richard Gregory : The British Association. The Council advised on treatments for scientific films on the Royal Institution, the Steam Engine and the Steam Turbine, and the Glass Industry. Eight issues of Monthly Science News have been published. At present the circulation is in English, Spanish and Portuguese, and has reached a total of twenty-one thousand, copies. This total includes the copies printed in Portugal. Arrangements for printing an English edition in Canada and Egypt, and a Spanish edition in Argentina have been made. The printing of an edition in Brazil is under consideration. The editor has received over 1,700 letters from persons who wish to be placed on the mailing list for Monthly Science News. 700 came from the United States, 400 from South America and 380 from the United Kingdom. The first number of the quarterly journal Endeavour, published by Imperial Chemical Indus tries, who received editorial aid and advice from the Council’s Science Committee, has been published. Members of the Engineering Panel have given advice on design and equipment to Mr. N. A. Miller of the Turkish Department of Education, in respect of the Ataturk Polytechnic which is to be built at Ankara. The Council is making plans for the inclusion of a pictorial exhibit in the British Pavilion at the forth coming International Fair at Smyrna. The subjects will be Rutherford and the Atom and Parsons and the Turbine. The preparation by Mr. W. O. Skeat of the photo graphs and captions for the Illustrated Brochure of British Engineering Achievement is virtually complete. The printing of Sir John Russell’s pamphlet on Rothamsted is proceeding. The Council has submitted proposals the exchange of scientific information between Britain and the Soviet Union, which have been approved by the Lord President of the Council and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. A number of requests and suggestions in accordance with these proposals have been communicated to the Soviet Government of the U.S.S.R. and are now under consideration by the appropriate scientific institutions of the Soviet Union. (b) MEDICINE The total number of medical journals in the Spanish language known to be publishing the summaries of British medical articles issued by the Council’s British Medical Information Service is now 61, distributed among 11 Ibero-American countries and Spain. The journals range in character from the weekly or monthly organs of professional associations to the scientific quarterlies representing the various medical specialities. Letters expressing appreciation have been received from the editors of many of these journals. These editors are themselves distinguished physicians or surgeons, who in most cases occupy teaching posts in universities and hospitals. One writes :— ^ “ I am very glad that at last some attention is being paid in England to this subject of capital importance to you .... once again I should like to say I am happy that you have at last considered it convenient to have a more ample spirit of inter change.” And another :— “ We have received with great interest .... the abstracts of interesting articles on ... . and shall have much pleasure in publishing them. It is for us a source of great admiration that in the middle of the gigantic struggle which the British Empire is making to restore peace and justice to the entire world, its men of science possess sufficient energy to continue without interruption or diminution their useful scientific work.” In addition to the abstracts, 17 complete papers of a total of over 64,000 words have been distributed in a Spanish translation and accepted for publication. Within the last month, a service of medical abstracts in Portuguese to the medical journals of Brazil and Portugal has been inaugurated.13 For the last 3 months, medical abstracts in English have been sent to medical journals in Australia, Canada, Ceylon, Egypt, East Africa, India, New Zealand, Palestine, South Africa and Switzerland. A favourable response has already been received from both of the Canadian journals approached. The English abstracts have also been sent to the Council’s representatives in Sweden and Turkey, for distribu tion as they think fit. (j) Students At the suggestion of the Mexican authorities, three scholarships have been offered for students from that country. A scholarship has been granted to a Chinese lecturer, who has been teaching at the School of Oriental Studies, in order that he may do research in English literature at Cambridge. A scholarship has also been granted to a student from Jamaica to supplement a scholarship which he gained in open competition at Brasenose College, Oxford, where he will study History and Law. Two South American doctors have arrived in this coi^K' to study War Surgery and Endocrinology. An lodgements have been made for them to have an opportunity of seeing the work which is being done in these subjects in various hospitals and institutions. Messrs. Metropolitan-Vickers have offered five vacancies for their College Apprenticeship Course engineering students from Peru, the Argentine, Brazil, Colombia. These trainees will receive a wage from Metropolitan-Vickers and the Council will pay their travelling expenses. Employment has been found for a further number of Council students who have finished their courses and are unable to return to their own countries. One Cypriot has obtained a teaching post; two Iraqis have been found training employment; one Greek has joined the Greek section of the B.B.C. and another has been given a temporary post by the Ministry of Food, so that he may undertake a special piece of research in dairying on their behalf; a Bulgarian student has joined the B.B.C.; a Hungarian has obtained a post as English master at a preparatory school; and a Polish medical student has been appointed lecturer in the Polish Medical Faculty at Edinburgh. The Board of Education has recognised as certi- fic/* teachers four of the Council’s Maltese teachers. They have been given posts in schools under the Middlesex Education Committee and will now receive a salary which will enable them to do without any financial assistance from the Council. The Council arranged a Vacation Course for foreign students at the University College of Exeter, from the 24th March to the 7th April. The course was organised for students who are studying under the auspices of the Council and for some of the students assisted by the Allied Governments. About 80 students were asked to attend the course as guests of the Council. A survey has been made of the conditions and needs of students from the Near East studying at the various Universities in this country, and arrange ments have been made with the University authorities concerned for their welfare and the supervision of their accommodation. The Cambridge University College Representatives have decided to continue their scheme of awarding bursaries to selected British Council students studying at Cambridge, so that the scholarships granted by the Council may be augmented to meet the higher cost of living at that University as compared with provincial Universities. In addition, Trinity Plall has offered one vacancy for a non-British student of exceptional ability. (k) Teaching Appointments During the past three months the following overseas appointments have been made— Near and Middle East Lecturers in English in British Institutes in the Near or Middle East—actual destinations not yet decided (B. C. Buckler, J. B. C. Elliott, C. F. PL Mallowan, J. S. Moggridge, J. W. Naylor, D. E. J. Pryse and J. B. West). EGYPT Administrative post in the Cairo Office of the Council (C. T. Middleton).

(1) Visual Publicity EXHIBITIONS An exhibition of sixty-four photographs of England and English life which was shown in Egypt before being sent on to Turkey received good notices in the Egyptian press, and proved such an attraction that a duplicate set has been prepared at the request of the Representative. These photographs will be exhibited in at least twenty-six centres. A further exhibition has been prepared for the International Smyrna Fair. PHOTOGRAPHS Besides those despatched for exhibitions, the following photographs were distributed :— Photographs of Their Royal Highnesses Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret Rose in a Christmas panto mime, to British colonies and Representatives of the14 Council; modem school and other buildings, to Turkey and Madeira; youth movements, to Turkey; general photographs of Britain, to a number of insti tutes and schools; documents in the British Museum, to Portugal. LANTERN LECTURES Five lantern lectures have been commissioned from the Courtauld Institute and the first has been received. MAPS One hundred maps were sent to the Representative in Turkey. Others were supplied to a number of British schools in Latin America. POSTERS Eight hundred and fifty posters were despatched to institutes and Anglophil societies. A number of silver cups were purchased for presentation to the University of Sao Paulo, the Chilean Navy and Air Force and other institutions in Latin America. Scripts for broadcasting were pro vided for the Representative in the Belgian Congo, and arrangements made for him to be supplied with London Transcription Service material. A consider able amount of material was despatched to centres in the United Kingdom in which the Council is interested. The latter included 1,700 posters of Mr. Churchill with the inscription: “Let Us Go Forward Together,” translated into ten Allied languages, including Russian and Chinese.

The Political authorities in the Gu. are very buc)i alive to the dangers which this involveai and the have been active, not only in discouraging the sending of students to Iraq, but also in encouraging educational improvements in the Gulf States themselves in order to provide a counter-attraction® The undesirability of Arabic-speaking students seeking their education in Iraq was the primary motive behind the schime, to whic. probably Cornwallis alluded in his first sentence, for tstablishing at Bahrain a Gulf College under British direction to provide higher education not only for Bahrainis and nationals of othe■' States, but also for students from Saudi Apabia, Hedramf.Jt aJa the Yemen. This project was put forward in 1939 by Mr. Vallanoe, who subsequently became Director of Education at Bahraini and the Bahrain Government, the Political authorities and tie £r t*aP Council have all shown themselves favourably disposed towards it.

British Embassy, Baghdad, 4th March 1942* copy Bear Maurice, For some tiac past discussions hays, I believe, been going on regarding the possibility of establishing after the war sone Arab educational centre under British direction. The arguments in favour of such a plan are many and convincing. 2. One aspect of the question which seems to give the proposal additional importance is the large number of Arab students who have in the past come to Iraq from Arab speaking dependencies of the British and Dutch Jinpires, and from the Yemen. At the moment we have established touch with 33 such students, distribu ted as follows It is very Undesirable from every point of view that pupils should come to seek education in Iraq. The atmosphere of the schools is politically and morally corrupt: the educational standard is appallingly low. I imagine that in present circumstances the movements of external pupils will be largely restricted. At the same time I suggest the desirability of informing the Governments of the various countries concerned that every obstacle should be places in the way of pupils coming to Iraq. I know that such steps were taken some time ago by the Governor of Aden. 3. I have instructed a member of my staff of establish contact with these Arab pupils in order to keep them as far as possible on the right lines during the time that they are cut off from their own countries. 4. The Iraq Government are responsible for their education and for their keep. They also give a small sum of pocket money to each pupil - about 5/- a month. This sum should be supple mented, and usually is, by remittances from relations. In present circumstances many of the pupils are cut off from communication with their homes. All are fit and well at present, but if necessity arises I will see that none of them becomes destitute. 6. I am sending copies of this letter to Sir Harold McMichael, Sir Miles Lampson and sir Ha thorn Hall.

The committee is composed of the Vice-Chancellor, the President of St. John’s, the Censor of St. Catherine’s Society, the Provost of Queen’s, the Warden of Wadham, the President of Trinity and the Warden of All Souls’. A joint Standing Committee of the Council and the Travel Association has been set up to co-ordinate activities affecting both bodies ; Sir Malcolm Robertson is Chairman and Lord Iliffe a member. Mr. T. W. Morray, Director of the Baghdad Institute has been awarded the M.B.E. Mr. W. R. L. Wickham has been appointed Repre sentative of the Council in Malta, Mr. J. S. Morrison, a Lecturer in the Baghdad Institute and a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, has been appointed Repre sentative in Palestine, and Mr. R. A. Cowling, Repre sentative in Uruguay.

The British Empire and Mandated Territories Note —Palestine and Cyprus form part of the Middle East area administered by the Council’s Representative in the Middle East. The Representatives in Malta and Aden report direct to London but are dependent on Cairo for certain routine and technical services. MALTA Mr. W. R. L. Wickham has been appointed Repre sentative in Malta while remaining Director of the Institute. At the time of writing, the Reports for March and April were the latest received from Malta. These two months cover the fiercest bombing attacks yet made upon the island and the Institute suffered further damage, in a greater or lesser degree, on five days in March and on nearly every day in April. The Director’s house has been made untenable by blast on two occasions. Despite these conditions the Director has maintained the activities of the Institute at full pressure, and the year 1941-42 ended with a final membership of 2,515. Few items in the Institute’s programme have been cancelled and the Concerts broadcast by the Rediffusion Company have continued to reach an audience of 20,000. Apart from the normal cinema programme at the Institute, a larger audience has been secured for Council films by lending them to the Information Office for a series of shows to farmers, and the projector and films have also been lent to the Welfare Officer of the R.A.F. An “ At Home ” in celebration of Empire Day was held on May 25th and was attended by H.E. the Governor and some 600 members. Flores College has suffered further heavy damage in air-raids, but the Principal is carrying on in her flat and in improvised accommodation. The work of St. Edward’s College has continued satisfactorily in the Old Seminary and the low fees, made possible by the Council, have helped to keep the College full. The Boy Scouts Association has managed to maintain its activities, although the Island Headquarters have been demolished. CYPRUS To facilitate co-ordination between the four Cyprus Institutes and to avoid unnecessary reference in matters of detail to Cairo, it has been decided to appoint a Representative in Cyprus under the general supervision of the Representative in the Middle East. Mr. K. M. Willey, Director of the Nicosia Institute, has been appointed Acting Representative. Mr. Willey returned from his tour of inspection of Schools in the Middle East area, controlled or assisted by the Council, early in April. Mr. C. A. F. Dundas, the Representative in2 the Middle East, undertook a tour of inspection of the Cyprus Institutes in June. The Institutes at Nicosia, Famagusta, Kyrenia and Larnaca re-opened after a short break at Easter and English classes were resumed immediately ; in addition a class for the teaching of Greek to British Officers was started at the Famagusta Institute. Membership of the Institutes has continued on a satisfactory level, although a slight falling off in the number of students, as opposed to club members, has been noticeable in the early months of the summer. A full programme of activities, social and otherwise, was successfully carried out by all the Institutes and at Famagusta lectures on A.R.P. were given. On May 23rd the Acting Representative had the honour of being received by H.R.H. the Duke of Gloucester. PALESTINE Mr. J. S. Morrison has been appointed Representative in Palestine. Haifa. During the absence in Cairo of the Director, Mr. F. G. Wood is acting Director of the British Institute, Haifa. The April statistics show that 109 students attended classes in that month. The usual other activities continue to be well supported. Jaffa. Here, there were in May 84 students and 71 club members. A lunch was given jointly by the Jaffa Institute and the Tel-Aviv School of English in honour of Professor H. R. Hamley, the newly-appointed Technical Expert to the Iraqi Ministry of Education, and of the Representative in the Middle East, who were both visiting Palestine. Members of the British, Arab and Jewish communities attended this function. Thirty-three Polish refugees attended the English classes arranged in Tel-Aviv by the Jaffa Institute. Tel-Aviv. The Council has taken over the Tel-Aviv School of English, the Principal, Mr. Aaronson, becoming Director. Some 600 students were, at the beginning of the quarter, attending English classes at this centre of adult education. Nablus. Seventy-six students and 204 club members were attending the Nablus Institute in May. Classes in phonetics conducted by Mr. Catford, were popular, and he has started similar classes at the Jaffa Institute, and the Tel-Aviv School of English. The average attendance at lectures held in April was 200. Games came to an end with April, but during that month the football team played several good matches against Army units sta tioned in the Nablus area. The Institute garden and swimming pool are in constant use in the summer and in June a swimming gala was arranged. Nazareth. At the beginning of April, there were already some 250 members of the new Institute at Nazareth, a number which had increased to 300 by May. Only a small proportion are being taught English because, in view of the shortage of staff, it has been considered wiser to concentrate on the social side of this Institute’s work. The Director has formed an Advisory Committee of three Moslem and three Christian Arabs, which is of great assistance in arranging the out-of-class activities. The Nazareth Nahada Club, a sporting and dramatic club, has been granted certain facilities at the Institute. In May five lectures were held, three in English, and two in Arabic and the first debate took place. A football eleven has been started, and has played several matches. The ladies’ branch of the Institute was opened for the registration of members on June 1st, suitable premises having been obtained. Mrs. Radley is in charge. ADEN Lieut.-Colonel M. C. Lake, the Representative in Aden and Southern Arabia, left Aden on leave in May ; on arrival in Cairo he was admitted to hospital, but at the time of writing was convalescent. Membership of the Aden Institute has increased steadily during the last quarter, the number at the end of April being 492, of whom 233 were Arabs, 72 English, 91 Indians, and 71 Jews. Under the direction of Mr. Emerson four language classes have been started two in Arabic and two in English, designed respectivelv for the English and Arabic speaking members. * WEST INDIES The Council has appointed Mr. Harold Stannard as its Cultural Adviser for the British West Indies. Mr Stannard has some previous knowledge of the West Indies and is a member of the Advisory Committee on Education in the Colonies. He will shortly be leaving for the West Indies and will work in close association with Mr. F. D. Gray, the Council’s newly-appointed Administrative Representative. WEST AFRICA Mr. Dundas’s report on his survey tour of West Africa has been received and is under consideration. EAST AFRICA In co-operation with the School of Oriental and African Studies, the Council has appointed Mr. Malcolm Guthrie to undertake a tour in the British East African territories to investigate possible opportunities for Council activities. Mr. Guthrie is a member of the staff of the African Department of the School and will combine his duties on behalf of the Council with the study of Swahili. 2. Foreign Countries a. Europe U.S.S.R. In the United Kingdom, Soviet seamen continued to visit certain of the centres in which the Council is interested, and other assistance was given to them by the Home Division. A graceful letter of thanks was received by the Chairman of the Council from one party of seamen. Arrangements are in hand for the supply of books and periodicals particularly of a learned or technical kind, to H.M. Embassy in Kuibyshev, for presentation. As recorded under music, the Council received a message from Soviet composers to their British col leagues. The gramophone records sent by the Council to Moscow were used for broadcasting and much of the music sent is being presented to Soviet institutions, through the generosity of the publishers. The Council undertook to attend to the establish ment or resumption of exchanges of publications between the All Union Lenin Library, Moscow (the Soviet counterpart of the British Museum Library) and certain British Institutions specified by the Library. For this purpose the Council is in communication with the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the British Museum, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the Royal Empire Society, the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux, the Library Association, the National CentraL Library, the School of Slavonic and Eastern Europeaw Studies, the London School of Economics and the Cambridge Philosophical Society. The Council provides the services of Miss B. M. H. Tripp as Secretary of the Anglo-Soviet Scientific Col laboration Committee, in which the Ministry of Information is also interested. This Committee was established after a meeting of representatives of numerous scientific bodies at the premises of the Royal Society. Sir John Russell, Adviser on Soviet Relations to the Ministry of Information is Chairman and Mr. J. G. Crowther, Secretary of the Council’s Science Committee is Vice-Chairman. A comprehensive list of British periodicals on economic and similar subjects which can be made available in the Soviet Union was sent to Kuibyshev. A considerable number of scientific enquiries addressed to Soviet institutions passed through the Council’s hands. ICELAND In addition to the usual English classes which have been well attended, the University have opened a Com-3 mercial Department in which the Representative has been asked to teach Commercial English. The Univer sity have also decided to establish a degree similar to the B.A. in which English will be one of the subjects and the Rector has asked that the Representative shall organise the two-year courses. The daily broadcasts, and the weekly news summary, in English over the Icelandic Broadcasting system have continued to attract large numbers of Icelandic listeners. The Representative takes a considerable part in the organisation of these broadcasts. The Icelandic Press has devoted an increased volume of space to material provided by the Council during the past quarter. PORTUGAL The number of members of the British Institute in Portugal at Lisbon was 1,717 on June 30th. The number of students enrolled for the third term of the academic year was 698. Examinations for the Cambridge Certificate of Proficiency in English were held in the Institute for the first time. The Students’ Union continued its usual activities and an exhibition of amateur photography was held in the Union and previously in the Institute itself. The Students’ annual ball and prizegiving took place on May 23rd, attended by H.M. Ambassador and Lady Campbell, the American Minister, the Secretary of the South African Legation (representing the Minister), the resident and Secretary of the Institute para a alta I 'ultura and representatives of the Portuguese Ministry of Education. The Programme included English and Portuguese songs by a students’ choir. More than 600 members, students and friends of the Institute were present. Mr. Philip Newman was inducted as Professor of a special class at the Lisbon Conservatoire, played at a number of concerts and recitals and made his debut in Oporto. The Institute organised a concert of English Chamber Music in co-operation with the National Society of Chamber Music. The Students’ choir met regularly twice a week. The two series of lectures at the Institute, on “Great Figures in English Literature” and “Great British Scientists,” were concluded. The latter was organised in connection with the Luso-Spanish Congress for the Progress of Science held in Oporto. The Anglo- Portuguese News published a special number dedicated to the Congress. Copies of this and sets of Monthly Science News in the Portuguese edition were presented to the delegates. The Officers of the Congress and selected delegates received copies of British Scientists by Sir Richard Gregory. Mr. W. L. Stevens read a paper in the Mathematical Section and with the Council’s co-operation, the B.B.C. broadcast 4 lectures in the Portuguese Transmission, dedicated to the Congress. ^The delegates received copies of the Portuguese scripts of the lectures. “English Sessions” were arranged at various provincial centres and lantern slide lectures were supplied to a number of provincial lyceums. M. de Winton is now in full control of the English teaching in the English Room of the Institute Superior de Ciencias Economicas e Financeiras, Lisbon. The Casa da Inglaterra, Coimbra, has had a par ticularly successful quarter, during which there have been weekly lectures and a number of receptions. The attendances at these, as at the English classes and other functions, are steadily growing. At the Sala Inglesa, Oporto, the English classes have met with continued success and five lectures, attended by up to 120 people have been given on various English subjects in addition to shows of British films, sing-songs and receptions. Professor Thomas Bodkin of the Barber Institute of Fine Arts, Birmingham, and Professor H. W. B. Cairns, Nuffield Professor of Surgery at Oxford, visited Portugal during the past quarter. Reports of Professor Cairns’ visit have not yet come to hand, but Professor Bodkin’s tour was a great success and aroused considerable interest in British art. SPAIN The Institute at Madrid has again had an interesting quarter. The number of students and members is steadily growing and Spanish cultural circles have been taking an increasing interest in the Institute owing to the quality of the lectures and exhibitions held there. Professor Thomas Bodkin gave a series of lectures on British art which attracted large and important audiences and Professor Cairns has just begun a series of lectures to the medical profession. In addition, the Director of the Institute, Professor Starkie, lectured on St. John of the Cross, in celebration of the 4th Centenary of that famous Spanish poet and mystic. This lecture was under the patronage of the Bishop of Madrid and was attended by the heads of the various religious orders. Professor Starkie also gave a number of other lectures, all of which had excellent attendances. During the quarter, the Institute was visited by the Bishop of Gibraltar, accompanied by Lady Maud Hoare. Mr. C. G. Goldie has been appointed locally as lecturer in English at the Institute. Mr. B. V. Kelly left England in May to take up his appointment as lecturer at the Institute. Miss Girling was seconded from the Council’s staff in London to be Secretary to the Director. SWEDEN The Representative, Mr. Bottrall, has continued to visit the Anglo-Swedish Societies in provincial centres during the quarter and has delivered a series of highly successful lectures which have received full and en couraging reports in the local press. The Assistant Lecturer, Mr. Charlesworth, has also had successful tours to the Workers’ Educational Centres and six provincial towns have requested return visits from him next year. The Council have been particularly fortunate in the two lecturers whom they sent from England this year. Sir Kenneth Clark and Mr. T. S. Eliot, each delivered a series of lectures in Stockholm, Upsala, Lund and Gothenburg to as many as 500 people. It is said, for example, that Mr. Eliot received more space in the Swedish Press than any non-Royal visitor has ever received before. With the Council’s assistance, Mr. A. H. King, of Lund University, is publishing an English Translation Course for Swedish students. Much is being done throughout Sweden to develop the delivery and sale of British books. A leading Swedish publisher, Dr. Sven Erik Bergh of Ljus A/B Stockholm, visited England in June to discuss with the Council and leading publishers here the publication and distribution of English literature in Sweden. He is being followed by Mr. Kaj Bonnier. Presentations of British scientific and other works have been made to leading Swedish institutions and an important reference library is being built up at the Council’s offices in Stockholm. Efforts to promote the use of British music and British plays in Sweden are meeting with an increasing success. By the supply of new furnishings, new books, gramo phones and other facilities, fresh life is being brought into the English societies and clubs all over Sweden with marked results, indicated by record attendances at functions during the past quarter. b. The Middle East The Representative in the Middle East visited Palestine, Iraq and Cyprus. Mr. R. N. Hollyer, Assistant Repre sentative, returned home for consultation. Mr. E. E. Deuchars, Director of the British Institute, Haifa, is working in the Cairo office during Mr. Hollyer’s absence. Mr. Covington, formerly an Assistant Representative in the Cairo office, has been appointed to Ankara to assist the Representative in Turkey. Mr. Reginald4 Davies, recently appointed Finance Officer of the Council, inspected the Council’s work in the Middle East. EGYPT Cairo. Seven hundred and seventeen students were attending the British Institute, Cairo, divided into 106 classes. These classes ranged from those devoted to the elementary teaching of English to classes for the Matriculation, Intermediate, and Final Examinations of the University of London. The latter included the usual scientific subjects, pure and applied mathematics, economics, history, accountancy, etc. While teaching is the main work of this Institute, a full programme of lectures and social activities was arranged, the Literary Society meeting every week. The Council approved the establishment of a British Boys’ Club in Cairo, since there are many Maltese and Cypriot children who have nowhere to spend their leisure moments. Alexandria. In April the Alexandria Institute had some 420 students. The Club continued to flourish— there were 87 members—and amongst its activities was a visit to the Kom El Nadoura meteorological station. During April the Rover Scouts spent a weekend in camp. A small grant was made to provide uniforms for the Scout troop of the Alexandria Maltese Youth Association. Assiut. Dr. C. P. Russell, the President of the American Mission gave a most successful lecture on America. A garden party was held for members and their friends, at which the Assiut Police Band played music to the guests.

Dr. Omar Khairat judged the 200 photographs which had been submitted. A lecture on the History of Mansura by Maitre Mohamed Mohamed Nosseir also deserves mention. Mehalla. At the British Institute, Mehalla, there were 42 students and 89 club members in May, of whom 38 were British. These British members take an active part in the general activities of the club, and were of great assistance in making a success of the social evenings and a performance of English songs given by the students. Professor H. S. Deighton and Major Ward Perkins gave lectures. Minia. The film shows were popular, particularly one at which a six-reel film of the Himalayas was shown with another film on India.

Perryman on “ How the U.S.A. are governed,” and “ Soviet Russia in the making,” Sheikh Ahmed el Kott on “ Woman in East and West,” Dr. Nasry Visser on “ Man and his animals,” and Dr. Sobri Guirgis on “ Contem porary Psychology and the War.” The birthday of Shakespeare was celebrated. Port Said. At the beginning of the quarter, there were over 300 students attending the Institute at Port Said. Of the classes 14 were for beginners or for those with little knowledge of English, and four were for advanced students. Six classes were formed in commercial subjects, and others for the study of British drama and art. Some 20 women members are attending a ladies’ class for English country dancing. The Institute is assisting in education courses for British troops and about 300 soldiers and sailors are being helped in this way. A full programme of lectures was carried out and a Dramatic Society and a Chess Club were established. Tanta. The number of students at the British Institute, Tanta, dropped in April to 56 owing to the hot weather! In that month, there were three lectures by Englishmen and three by Egyptians, and the Institute enjoyed a visit from Mr. W. A. Smart, Oriental Secretary to H.M. Embassy, Cairo. In May was shown “The British Institute, Tanta,” a film produced on the initiative of the Director to provide a permanent record of the Institute’s activities and to give the Council’s London office some idea of the work in an Egyptian provincial Institute. Two lectures by Egyptians are noteworthy, “ Roman Remains in the Syrian Desert,” by Dr. Emik Saigh, and “ The Positive and the Negative Man,” by Mr. H. Bakry. A most successful lecture was also given by Mr. Leonard Mosley, a War correspondent, on the Western Desert. In the same month the first exhibition of paintings was held in the Institute and in June the Institute Players presented “ A Pair of Spectacles.” Zagazig. Here, the latest attendance figures are 39 students and 74 club members.

The Assistant Director continued to teach at the Adadiya El Ahlya Secondary School. TURKEY From April 1st, the Council’s office in Ankara became independent of the Cairo office, and will in future communicate direct with London. Mr. R. Davies, the newly-appointed Finance Officer, visited Turkey in company with the Representative in the Middle East. Mr. W. H. Covington arrived in Turkey to take up his duties as Assistant Representative. On the conclusion of his English courses for Turkish officers at Robert College, Mr. H. L. Littler was transferred from Turkey to Abyssinia.T In addition to the areas administered by the Directors, Mr. Lucas, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Lake, the northern and north-western areas of Turkey are supervised by Mr. I. E. Jago and Mr. Nasmi Aydin (working in con junction with H.M. Consul, (^anakkale), respectively. By the beginning of the period under review, English courses were being held by Council teachers in 15 provinces of Turkey, and the Council was in touch with the Governments of 13 provinces. Excepting the militarized zones, which are difficult of access, the Council’s influence has therefore in less than two years been extended to almost the whole of the country. By April, English courses had been started in a further 14 Turkish institutions, making a total of 56. Plans lor an extension of activity, particularly in “ European Turkey ” and in the military zones, were carried out as far as available staff permitted, and by June, the total number of the Council’s pupils in Turkey had increased from 2,899 in December, 1941, to 3,446. During the same period the number of Halkevis in which English classes were held increased from 17 with 928 students to 29 with 1,326 pupils, and the number of courses for military groups from 3 to 8. Summer courses for Ankara teachers and airmen of Eskisehir opened on June 15th. Encouraged by the success of all these courses the Peoples’ Party has itself started English classes in a number of Halkevis for which the Council is supplying text books. Mr. Ronald Syme, formerly Lecturer in Ancient Tlistory at Oxford, and recently on the staff of the B.I.O. Istanbul, has started a three months’ lecture tour for the Council in Turkey. Dr. C. J. Leech, assisted by Miss M. Clegg, has been nominated Director of the English Department of the Girls’ Side of the Turk Maarif Lycee in Ankara. With the departure of the Maltese for India, the Council’s instruction for Maltese in the French Schools at Istanbul and Smyrna came to an end. Special lectures were given in May by the Hon. S. Runciman, first Istanbul Professor of Byzantinology, who lectured to the Turkish Historical Association in Ankara, and by Mr. Derek Patmore, author and play wright, who spoke on the “ Modern Development of the English Novel,” to a distinguished gathering at the Eminonu Halkevi, Istanbul. The Council has opened lending libraries of English books at Ankara, Istanbul and Smyrna, and these have already won great popularity. The cancellation of the International Fair at Smyrna was announced by the Turkish Government at the end of May. The despatch of the Council’s material for the Fair, which included books, photographs and a science section has, however, been completed and it will be used for other exhibitions planned for Ankara, Istanbul and Smyrna. Publications on agriculture, agricultural education, 4fend general education, have been presented by the appropriate Departments of the Governments of Canada, India, New Zealand and South Africa to Turkey, for the Higher Agricultural Institute at Ankara, the Agricultural Research Institute at Bornovo (Smyrna), and the Turkish Ministry of Education. Further educational material has been sent to the Turkish Ministry by the Board of Education, including an autographed copy of the Year Book of Education which Mr. R. A. Butler has sent to the Turkish Minister. At the request of the Turkish Ambassador in London, publications on the Boy Scout and Girl Guide organisations have been provided for the recently formed “ Direction Generale d’Education Physique ” in Turkey. On June 6th the Council’s exhibition of photographs of British Educational Institutions was opened at the Ankara Halkevi with a most cordial and appreciative speech by the Minister of Education. Almost all the principal educationists of Turkey and a large number of other leading figures attended the opening ceremony. On the same day the Council’s Representative and the Ankara Director had the privilege of receiving at the exhibition, the President of the Republic, Ismet Inonu, accompanied by the Minister of Education and Presi- 5 &gt; 5 i / U$ dential Chefs du Cabinet and Aides-de-camp. The President inspected the exhibition in great detail and conversed with the Council’s representatives for nearly two hours. Amongst others received at the exhibition were H.M. Ambassador, the Prime Minister, the new Minister of the Interior, Dr. Fikri Tuzer, and the new Secretary-General of the People’s Party, Meniduh Sevket Esendal. The Exhibition and the President’s interest in it attracted wide attention and were headline news in the Turkish press. Messages were sent by the President of the Board of Education, the Rt. Hon. R. A. Butler, to the Minister of Education and by the Chairman of the Council to the Secretary General of the People’s Party. The arrangements for supplying specialist periodicals from England have been completed and the Repre sentative distributes a varying number of copies of 150 different periodicals. The list of recipients includes almost all the leading statesmen, scholars and technicians of the country. In the first three months of the year there were 93 Council films in Turkey and in April some 22,000 people, including the President’s wife and mother, saw them in Ankara alone. Plans are well advanced for the publication of a wide range of Turkish translations of English classics. The Turkish Halkevi in London provided a regular programme of interesting activities, including a number of lectures. Special fixtures were the celebration of Cocuk Bayrami on April 23rd, when over 400 children and 50 adults attended the Halkevi, and the celebration of the Turkish Sports Festival on May 19th, at which the guests were members of the Middlesex Wanderers, who sent a team to Turkey in 1939. On June 16th, Bay Ozbekkan lectured on “ Turkish Civil Administration” to an audience of mayors, mayoresses and town clerks of metropolitan boroughs. Turkish ladies’ “ At Homes ” have been held regularly each week, and lessons in Turkish, for which there were over 100 applicants, have been started. c. Ibero-America ARGENTINA The Council deeply regret to record the death after a long and painful illness of Mr. James Donaldson, Founder and Honorary Secretary of the Asociacion Argentina de Cultura Britanica at Cordoba. Mr. Donaldson did excellent work in Cordoba in furthering the knowledge of English culture and his death means a great loss to his friends in Argentina as well as to the “ Cultura.” His place is being taken by Mr. Alec Clifford. Under the auspices of the Asociacion Argentina de Cultura Inglesa at Buenos Aires, a memorial plaque to Robert Billinghurst, the British pioneer who was the fourth foreigner to receive Argentine citzenship, was recently unveiled. The new reading-room and library of the Asociacion Argentina de Cultura Inglesa at Buenos Aires was officially opened by H.M. Ambassador, Sir Esmond Ovey. This excellent collection, which comprises reference books and a lending library, contains some 6,300 volumes. The Director of the Association reports that there are at present in operation 115 different classes of 15 different standards, with a total enrolment so far of 3,600 in the current year. Dr. Francis Scully, whose despatch to South America as a general representative of the British Book Trade was initiated and assisted by the Council, will lecture on literary subjects to the Association’s members. A series of most successful lectures on cultural subjects has been given in English and Spanish at the Cordoba Association to audiences numbering in some cases nearly 300. For the present year, a number of Univer sity professors have agreed to lecture in Spanish on various aspects of English life. The Reading Room and “ Round Table Talks ” (informal gatherings on the lines of a Debating Society) have become very popular features. “J • •6 Now installed in their new premises, a large house in the centre of the residential quarter of the town, the Asociacion Rosarina de Cultura Inglesa has started the scholastic year with 400 pupils and nearly 800 members, thus exceeding by 200 and 300 respectively the numbers which it hoped to reach. Ceremonies were held at the opening of the new premises and of the exhibition of engravings, which arrived at Rosario in May, and a series of other activities has been arranged. Dr. Castro O’Connor, the Argentine surgeon who for many years past has been tireless in his efforts to promote Anglo-Argentine medical relations, is being entertained in this country by the Council for six months, during which time he will make a special study of plastic surgery under Sir Harold Gillies and a general inspection of British medical activities in war-time. BOLIVIA The arrival at La Paz of a collection of British colour prints from the Council afforded an opportunity for the official opening of the Anglo-Bolivian Cultural Institute, which had, in fact, already been in active operation for six months. The President of the Republic and several Ministers of State were present and in his inaugural speech the President of the Institute, Senor Aramayo, said : “ . . . Great Britain is now the main depository of humanity’s hope ; she could not, after nurturing so many immortal geniuses, remain impassive before the pyres that feed their flames with books and works of art, still less before the gibe which described as ‘ Scraps of paper’ the most solemn pacts agreed between nations. England is fighting at present for all those extremes— for the liberty of the oppressed peoples, for the life of culture and for respect of legal undertakings, voluntarily entered into and freely agreed, which are the only lasting basis upon which to build the peace of the world. “ . . . The Anglo-Bolivian Cultural Institute is the logical offspring of all the realities that I have mentioned briefly. Its programme may well be expressed in this sentence : the tightening of intellectual bonds between Bolivia and Great Britain as the surest means of effectively defending the beliefs of both countries. The Institute is born under the auspices of the British Council, whose aims are to bring together peoples which, though separated by great distances, nevertheless live by the same ideals . . .” The Minister of Education and the Director of the Institute of Fine Arts also spoke. On learning that English lessons were given at the Institute, the President of the Republic intimated that he wished to take advantage of them, and the Director of the Institute now goes regularly twice a week to the Presidential Palace and instructs him in English. BRAZIL The Societies at Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte are maintaining their usual activities. The Director of the Rio Society reports that matriculations at the beginning of the academic year numbered 976, which is more than 200 above those on the same date last year. The Branch Society at Nictheroy has been entirely reorganized and housed in new and attractive premises, with encouraging results. The Society at Belo Horizonte now has 253 students enrolled and attending courses and 206 members. The Representative, Mr. E. E. R. Church, reports that all the civil, military and religious authorities of the State of Parana were either present or represented at the official inauguration of the new Anglo-Brazilian Cultural Society at Curitiba.

Ninety-eight pupils are now attending classes at the Society. CHILE The Chilean-British Institute was founded on May 24th, 1938, and in honour of the Institute’s fourth anni versary and of Empire Day a luncheon was given which was attended by the President of the Institute, Senor Carlos Atienza, Senor Arturo Alessandri Palma, for merly President of Chile, the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of Public Education and many other dis tinguished people. H.M. Embassy at Santiago comment : “ The satis factory attendance was undoubtedly due to the under lying popularity of the cause for which we are fighting, but it was at the same time a tribute to the reputation which the Institute is gaining.” The Chilean authorities have requested that the elementary classes in English for the Chilean Police Force should be wholly sponsored by the Chilean- British Institute in Santiago and the Council has agreed to subsidize a teacher for this purpose. The Institute had already been represented on the board of examiners which tested Police Force candidates for interpreterships in English and had made a presentation of text books for the classes. Two successful performances of “ The Barretts of Wimpole Street,” were given by members of the Institute. The new Chilean-British Institute at Concepcion continues to prosper and hopes to move shortly to new premises in the centre of the city. 16-mm. film projectors are being presented to the Chilean-British Institutes in Santiago, Valparaiso and Concepcion. St. John’s Boys’ School, Concepcion, has been re organized and reopened in new premises. It has over 100 pupils, as against 60 six months ago. ^ COLOMBIA Reports covering the first quarter of 1942 have now been received from the Directors of the Colombian- British Cultural Institutes at Bogotd and Cali. The Institute at Bogotd has in all respects made considerable progress. A move has been made to larger premises but the growth of the Institute has been such that even the new premises have become too small and an adjoining building has been acquired. The number of students in attendance is 480 as against 350 at the same date last year and there are 50 social members. The non-teaching activities of the Institute have been greatly expanded. A series of lectures was inaugurated by the Minister of Education, who gave an excellent talk on his memories of England. Many of the most distinguished intellectuals of the country have agreed to participate in these lectures. The standard is high and the reputation of the Institute has greatly profited by the publicity afforded by them. Tennis, football, chess, hockey, rambling, photographic, music and English Conversation clubs have been organized and among the Institute’s other attractions are the library, film meetings and the popular Social Room. The Cali Institute has been reorganized in new^ premises in the centre of the town which were officially^ opened by H.M. Minister. The guests included the Mayor of Cali, the Bishop and important business men and officials. The number of students increases steadily. ECUADOR Sir Eugen Millington-Drake’s visit to Ecuador on his way to Buenos Aires was much appreciated in official, intellectual and sporting circles. He broadcast on the aims of the British Council and was introduced by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who expressed his strong sympathy with such aims. During Sir Eugen’s visit, an Ecuadorean-British Institute was formally established in Quito with the help of prominent Ecuadorean citizens and cultural societies. PARAGUAY Eighty-four students have enrolled for the English classes organized in Asuncion on behalf of the Council by Mr. J. H. Stevens. In addition, daily private classes lasting one hour are given to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Education and Public Instruction.PERU At Lima new premises have been taken by the British- Peruvian Cultural Association, which is now situated in a large house next door to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Association’s report for 1941 records its complete recovery from the set-back caused by the earthquake in May, 1940. The Association has 40 Governors, 180 affiliate members and an average daily attendance of 218 students in English (as compared with 116 last year) organized into 13 classes. Mr. Cyril Musgrave has been appointed Director of the Association in succession to Mrs. Watkins, who has been in charge of the Association’s affairs since its foundation and now remains on the teaching staff. There are altogether six teachers conducting the Association’s classes. The British-Peruvian Cultural Association of Southern Peru at Arequipa is flourishing at the end of its first year of existence. URUGUAY Mr. R. A. Cowling, Director of the Anglo-Uruguayan Cultural Institute at Montevideo since the beginning of 1939, has been appointed Representative of the Council in Uruguay, in addition to his duties as Director of the Montevideo Institute. The number of students at the Institute has reached the record figure of 1,540, as against 950 last year, and classroom space was so severely taxed by the 77 classes d 20 teachers that it was found necessary to take tra accommodation in the new building. A new section of higher studies, of which Mr. Groom will be director has been created. Extra-mural classes are being given in seven Uruguayan institutions ranging from the “ Escuela Industrial ” (the Polytechnic of Uruguay) to a small group of negro students. The official incorporation of English into the curriculum of the Escuela is a notable success. A full programme of social activities has been arranged in the Institute with a number of lectures and a series of broadcast talks on cultural subjects is given each week by members of the staff. Lectures given by Mr. Groom in his capacity as Professor of English at Montevideo University have twice overflowed the rooms assigned to them ; Mr. Cowling has been asked to lecture in the Government-sponsored series “ Arte y Cultura Popular.” Since its foundation last November the film department of the Institute has organized 51 exhibitions in hospitals, clinics and other Uruguayan institutions. The work of the provincial institutes has been main tained and co-ordinated. In April and May H.M. Minister followed up his visits of last November to the institutes at Mercedes, Fray Bentos, Paysandu and Salto with a second to Mercedes and another to the institute at Rivera. At Mercedes, Mr. Stevenson dis- 'ibuted the prizes, inspected the new premises and discussed the institute’s affairs with the new Director, Mr. D. MacGillycuddy. At Rivera, he addressed about 200 persons : leading citizens of Rivera and of the neighbouring Brazilian town of Santa Ana were present. VENEZUELA An exhibition of English photographs held at the Venezuelan-British Cultural Institute achieved a notable success, being visited by between 900 and 1,000 people. Special lighting was installed in the Photographic Salon and the resultant effect was so pleasing that the Director of the Museo de Bellas Artes immediately sought per mission to hold an exhibition of modern painting in the Institute. It is intended to make the Photographic Salon an annual event. In addition, the Institute is announcing for this year a special competition on the subject, “ Remains of Colonial Architecture in Caracas.” Efforts to expand the members’ side of the Institute met with success. Social functions have been held about once a week, Venezuelan attendance reaching about 150 on three recent occasions. d. Other Countries CHINA Mr. E. R. Hughes, Reader in Chinese Religion and Philosophy at Oxford, reached Chungking safely in April and has since visited Chengtu and Kunming. Mr. Hughes, who has been asked to make certain investigations on behalf of the Council, has had a very gratifying reception. His coming at such a time has created a profound impression, and he reports a con siderable hunger among Chinese scholars for increased intellectual contact with the Western world. The Council hopes to develop the cultural rapproche ment which Mr. Hughes’ visit has revived, and Dr. Joseph Needham, Reader in Bio-Chemistry at Cam bridge University has already accepted an invitation to go out as a visiting professor to the Academica Sinica in Chungking. The Chinese Minister of Education has set up a Selection Committee for Chinese research students who are to be sent to this country by the Chinese Govern ment ; as stated in the last Quarterly Report the Council has offered to maintain 10 of the students brought to England under this scheme. The Council has made itself responsible for the salary of Dr. Gordon King, late of Hong Kong University, and now Professor in the Medical School at Kweiyang.

The Council has published a small pamphlet for the use of Education and Welfare Officers attached to Dominion and Allied Forces. The pamphlet will enable these officers to be well informed of the way in which the men in their charge can obtain private hos pitality on leave. It has been compiled at the request, and with the co-operation of the National Voluntary Societies concerned with this problem. b. Representatives of the Dominion forces and the Allied Governments have made frequent approaches to the Council for assistance in enabling members of the forces to see more of Britain and her institutions. The facilities requested can be divided into (i) professional, i.e., to enable serving personnel to maintain their interest in their peacetime professions and (ii) arrange ments, mainly to benefit merchant seamen, for seeing places of historic and technical interest and for sport and recreational activities. These facilities will not only assist in maintaining the morale of men whose knowledge of England may be limited to dock areas or isolated districts, but will enable them to have a far greater knowledge of and interest in the United Kingdom. It is worth recording tfiat the Ministry of War Transport has agreed to allocate ^itrol to the Council to enable transport to be available for such purposes. Professional and other facilities made available for Dominion, Colonial and Allied forces are recorded under those headings. The following are examples of the type of facility arranged for merchant seamen. One hundred and fifty Soviet seamen visited collieries, where they were entertained to lunch by the miners, and village schools to see athletic displays ; free seats at theatres and visits to places of historic interest were arranged. Football matches were also arranged between the Soviet and other Allied seamen and an exchange of visits instigated between civic authorities headed by the Lord Mayor, and the Captain and senior officers of the Red Fleet. In London a problem is presented by the large number of young Norwegians who succeed in escaping to this country. For these the Council has been able to arrange a number of excursions and recreational facilities, in cluding honorary membership of a number of football clubs, reduced price of admission to such places as Madame Tussauds and the Zoological Gardens, pro vision of free football grounds, regular conducted visits twice weekly to the Tower of London and week-end walks to the neighbouring countryside with young British people.

At the request of the Polish Government the Counci arranged interviews for Polish Officers selected by the Polish authorities with a view to voluntary employment in British administrative offices, so that first-hand know ledge might be obtained of British methods in local government, Police Forces, forestry work, transport and legal institutions. 11 The Council arranged for Belgian and Czechoslovak doctors now serving with the Belgian and Czechoslovak Forces to visit Oxford for the week-end of May 30th— 31st to see something of medical work at that University Sir Farquhar Buzzard and Professor H. B. Cairns gave much valuable assistance in making the visit an out standing success. Officers of the Netherlands Brigade made a special visit to the Birmingham Repertory Theatre and as a result invited the whole cast to their Brigade head quarters. The Council has been in close touch with the re training centres for wounded Allied servicemen par ticularly for members of the Free French Forces and the Polish Forces. b. AIR FORCES The Regional Officers have maintained regular visits to R.A.F. stations to which Allied units are posted. Requests for the Council’s films with scripts for use in connection with the teaching of English have increased. In addition to the usual supplies of literature, prizes of books have been presented for improvement in English to a barrage balloon unit of the Polish Air Force. Thirty Czechoslovak airmen paid a very successful day’s visit to Cambridge where in addition to visiting the colleges, arrangements were made for them to see work in some of the laboratories. C. ALLIED NAVIES The Admiralty has recently sent instructions to British Liaison Officers and to Amenities Officers pointing out the facilities which are available to personnel of the Allied Navies through the Council. Three part-time teachers of English have been appointed to the Royal Greek Navy and Greek officers and ratings have on two occasions visited London and had a series of visits arranged for them, including a tour of bombed areas. d. UNITED STATES PERSONNEL The Council has maintained the closest co-operation with the Grigg Committee and has supplied a number of facilities for the C.T.C. and A.T.A. In Edinburgh the Council s assistance was sought in commemorating U.S.A. Remembrance Day. €. DOMINION FORCES The High Commissioner of Canada presided over a conference between representatives of the Canadian Army and the British Council when questions relating to the Council s work for the Canadian Army were discussed. With the co-operation of British Movietone News the Council are now supplying weekly newsreels to the Canadian Army. Supplies of literature, including technical books and French books have been distributed and a considerable number of portraits of T.M. the King and Queen and the Prime Minister and posters have been supplied. The Council has agreed to bear a proportion of the cost of fees for N.C.O.s and men of the Canadian Army to enable them to attend a special course at Oxford for Dominion, American and Allied Forces. The question of the Council’s assistance to Dominion Air Units is under discussion and the Air Ministry have arranged for Mr. Steel to visit New Zealand, Australian and Canadian squadrons in his area so that the Council may have first-hand opinion as to the probable require ments. The Air Ministry have also requested the Council’s assistance for Dominion personnel on their first arrival in England and in the supply of suitable literature on the voyage to the United Kingdom. /. NEWFOUNDLAND LOGGERS At the request of the Dominions Office and the Ministry of Supply the Council has undertaken to make12 gS»- available a number of facilities to over 1,500 loggers in Scotland. g. INDIAN TECHNICIANS AND INDIAN SEAMEN The Council has continued to assist groups of Indian technicians, particularly in Birmingham and Manchester. Parties of these technicians have visited Oxford and Cambridge for very successful day visits. Assistance has also been given to the newly-founded Indian Seamen’s Recreation Centre at Hull. 11. COLONIAL TECHNICIANS AND SEAMEN A group of technicians from Jamaica were entertained by the Council on June 1st. A tour of London was arranged for them followed by a luncheon, presided over by Sir Angus Gillan. In Newcastle for the first time a concert was arranged in co-operation with C.E.M.A. for Colonial seamen. This experiment was most successful. The Council has also provided a number of facilities for the newly-opened Colonial House in Newcastle, and at the West Indian House in the same city arrangements were made for the B.B.C. to record West African songs sung by seamen. The results were subsequently broad cast to West Africa. In Cardiff the constructional work on the Islamic Centre is in progress and the Council’s Officers in that city have given considerable assistance to the Moslem population. 14. Gibraltarians Lectures in London have been arranged at 11 Centres with visits to the places discussed. Community singing classes are held regularly every three weeks at six Centres and speech training and dramatic classes at three Centres. Seventeen Gibraltarian Centres have now been presented with libraries and during the past three months 50 film shows have been given at Gibraltarian Centres and one puppet show. 15. National Days and Special Celebrations The Council has given considerable assistance in the commemoration of National Days, for example, in Manchester Poland’s National Day was commemorated by a special concert by the Halle orchestra and by a film show of British and Polish films for the Polish Forces and civilians. In Cardiff Norway’s Day of Independence was commemorated at the Norwegian Church when the speakers included the Lord Mayor of Cardiff. Similar events were arranged in other cities in the United Kingdom. The Council’s Officers gave considerable help to many civic authorities on United Nations’ Day. The Council also played a major part through their Regional Officer in Scotland in the organisation of the Edinburgh Allies Week which terminated with an address by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. IV FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES a. Books and Periodicals BOOK PRESENTATIONS The work of this quarter has been heavy. Two important collections of medical books have been sent to Mexico, one to the Department of Physiology of the Medical Faculty of the National University and one to the Library of the School of Hygiene of Mexico. Small collections of works on Tropical Hygiene and Medicine have been sent to Missionary centres in French Equa torial Africa. A third large medical collection has been sent to the Library of the Madrid Institute where the demand for English medical books is steadily increasing. The great Benedictine Monastery of Montserrat, which suffered severely in the war, has been sent a large number of erudite works, mainly theological and literary texts, and reference books. An appeal for works of scholastic philosophy and theology came from an important Jesuit seminary in San Miguel, one of the two Pontifical Universities in Latin America. In responding to these and other requests the Council has had the invaluable assistance of the Jesuit College in Oxford, Campion Hall. In Brazil the recently established Institutes at Curityba and Santos are opening up new fields of work and already one important presentation has been made to the University of Parand, at Curityba. The Director of Physical Education in Parand has asked for books on his own subject for himself, and on Histology and Embryology, History, Philosophy, Psychology and English Literature for the University Faculties of Medi cine and of Philosophy. Science and Letters. This presentation led to a second request for books for the Library of the Institute de Biologia Agricola y Animal. Among many other interesting requests, has been one from Turkey for information on English Women’s Clubs and Institutions. Another has been for books in use in English Theological Seminaries, which came from the head of a Turkish Society commissioned by the President to provide training schools for Moslem Priests. In addition, a reference library on Turkey, including some rare works is being built up for the Turkish Halkevi in London. Books are being sent to form a good reference library in the Council’s office in Stockholm. A smaller collection of the same kind has been sent to the Buenos Aires office. To Sweden there have gone also books on welfare work and emergency education in war-time, and fifteen hundred textbooks for use in the Summer Schools for Swedish teachers and students which the Council i!r^ holding at Sigtuna. WORK IN THE UNITED KINGDOM Work in providing libraries for Allied Armies has increased greatly and is going steadily ahead. Presenta tions have been made for libraries in the Belgian Institute and the Yugoslav House. PUBLICATIONS The new “ Science in Britain ” Series is now taking shape. The English edition of Sir John Russell’s booklet on the Rothamsted Experimental Station was com pleted at the beginning of July and the Spanish and Portuguese editions are in proof. The English editions of The Royal Institution, by T. M. Martin, and Sir Charles Parsons and His Work, by R. H. Parsons, are being set ; Spanish and Portuguese translations are being made of these two booklets and of Science Lifts the Veil, a series of broadcast talks arranged by Sir William Bragg not long before his death. It is not proposed to publish the Rothamsted booklet until the other three titles are ready, but some copies of it are being sent at once to U.S.S.R. and the Middle East. British Contributions to Persian Studies, by A. J. Arberry (Is. net), and British Book News, 1941 (6s. net), have been published by Longmans Green, and ail^ edition of the former in Persian is proposed. British Trade Unions, by John Price, with a Foreword by the Rt. Hon. Ernest Bevin, has at last been passed for press, and will be published by Longmans at Is. net as soon as possible. Publication of the first international Guild Books has been further postponed by printing and binding difficulties but it is hoped to issue the first twelve titles in August. Further brochures in the British Life and Thought Series are in preparation on British Music, Literature and Theatre. British Contributions to Indian Studies and British Contributions to Mexican Studies, have been commissioned. BOOK LISTS National Book Council Book Lists which have been widely distributed during the quarter include those on Commerce, Aeronautical Engineering and Automobile Engineering. PERIODICALS Work in the Dominions and Colonies is expanding *rapidly, and reports which are coming to hand show already that this new development is appreciated. Local authorities and organisations are assisting with the distribution of educational and technical material to Mission Schools in West and East Africa, and many interesting letters from remote centres indicate that the Council is meeting a real need. In collaboration with the Ministry of War Transport periodicals are now being despatched by a special channel to Seamen’s Clubs in two ports of the U.S.S.R., and there have been further increases in the number of such Clubs in other countries to which periodicals in English and other languages are supplied. The exchange of scientific and technical publications with Swedish institutions is progressing rapidly, and in addition a regular consignment of twenty sets of literary and technical periodicals is being sent to the Representa tive in Sweden for distribution to Anglophil Societies and other institutions. The most interesting feature of the work in Spain has been the number of enquiries from official bodies which wish to keep in touch with developments in British educational methods, medical and scientific research and other subjects. The Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas, for instance, asked for reviews dealing with economics, medicine, engineering, science and the organisation of labour ; the Oficina Central de Docu mental Profesional, for information on engineering, applied science and the teaching methods used in technical training centres, whilst the Escuela Nacional ^e Puericultura asked for journals dealing with mater- nity, the physical education of children and school hygiene. From Switzerland have come requests for information on industrial matters, and letters have been received from recipients of magazines such as Illustrated London News expressing their interest in British achievements and their friendship for this country. Requests came from Turkish Women’s Associations for material describing the activities and type of work carried out by similar organisations in this country. The approach to the English institutions evoked a number of interesting responses, indicating that many of them were grateful for the opportunity of resuming previous contacts, others asking if they could be put in direct touch with the Turkish organisations with a view to the exchange of publications, news-letters and personal correspondence. An arrangement has been made with the Air Ministry for the despatch of newspapers and magazines by direct air service to the Institute in Malta, where they now arrive in a few days instead of several months. b. Export of Publications BOOK EXPORT SCHEME During this quarter orders have been placed to the ^ross value of £2,810. Malta has now been included ™ this scheme. Priority of shipment has also been obtained for books despatched to Malta, the Middle East and Lisbon. The scheme appears to be spreading in Brazil. Several large orders have been accepted from new bookshops in that country. TURKISH BOOK SUBSIDY Information has recently been received that the first orders placed under the subsidy reached Turkish book sellers safely and that the books were all sold within two days. Further orders, to the gross value of £564 16s. have been placed during this quarter. Priority of freight has been obtained for books shipped to Turkey. BOOKS FOR RESALE To encourage booksellers, reluctant to take advantage of the book subsidy, owing to the complications of exchange and the delays and risks of placing orders abroad, arrangements have been made to supply the Representative in Ankara quarterly with books of a general character for distribution among Turkish book sellers for sale in their shops. Funds expended in this way are recoverable by the Council from the booksellers. BOOK EXHIBITIONS Some 1,400 books of medical, scientific and general interest were despatched for exhibition in Turkey and some 500, chiefly on theological, philosophical, medical and legal subjects have been sent to Reykavik. A general collection of some 1,500 books has been assembled and despatched to Spain for exhibition in the Madrid Institute next autumn. The Oxford Univer sity Press very kindly lent a copy of their handsome collotype reproduction of the Luttrall Psalter. The exhibition of textbooks despatched six months ago to Colombia opened successfully in Bogota. It will be shown later in Ecuador. BOOK REVIEWS The Argentine Association of English Culture is now being supplied with eight instead of four books a month for review in the English language paper, the Standard. Books are now being sent from London with reviews attached for translation and adaptation by the two Spanish language papers, El Nacion and El Mundo. In Brazil, a new contact has been made with Pais E Filhos, a paper devoted to education and child welfare. Arrangements have been made to send for local review six books a month to Ecuador of which four are of medical or scientific interest and two general. In Spain books are being ordered for review in two new periodicals, Razon y Ed and Hispania. Medical books, with reviews attached are being sent to medical journals in South America and Europe. Arrangements were made with the B.B.C. for book reviews to be given in the Swedish and Portuguese broadcasts, and for the Arab Listener to publish each month the broadcast of a monthly review of books on various aspects of British life. BOOK TRANSLATIONS The Council continues to help the translation of British books by clearing copyright, transmission of reading copies, etc. Most of the requests received came from Swedish publishers on whose behalf 43 books were dealt with. Requests for translation rights were also received from Spain and Portugal. The Turkish trans lation rights of a number of works by classical British novelists were cleared to facilitate a proposed series of such translations in Turkey. At the request of the Persian Ministry of Education the Persian translation rights in several authoritative books on British life and institutions have been cleared. c. Britain To-day Reports from the British Library of Information in New York indicate that the sale of Britain To-day in the United States has begun. Subscriptions were 1,800 at the beginning of June and are still coming in. Improved air service to Sweden has enabled the number of copies sent to be increased from 25 to 500. The Representative in Sweden proposes to raise the circulation to 3,000. The Representative in Brazil reports that he is already covering all the big public libraries, university faculties, secondary and technical schools and newspapers there, and anticipates an increased distribution in the near future. d. Drama The Council continued to send out texts of British plays to Sweden for translation and performance ; and has also acted as intermediaries in negotiations for the translation and performance of Mr. Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion in Brazil, and of Mr. Noel Coward’s Private Lives and Miss Daphne du Maurier’s Rebecca in Madrid. Negotiations are continuing for the marketing of British plays in Ibero-America through a central agency in Buenos Aires. Arrangements have been made for Mr. Larus Palsson, the Manager and Producer of the leading theatrical company in Iceland, to visit England as the Council’s14 guest in July.’ Mr. Palsson will attend the Stratford Festival and it is hoped will see something of the work of the Old Vic and Sadlers Wells Ballet, and will study the English theatre in general. In view of the increased interest in British drama shown by the play-reading and amateur dramatic circles of the Council’s Institutes abroad, arrangements are proceeding with a view to such Institutes becoming corporate members of the British Drama League. The practice continues of sending British plays to Institutes, play-reading societies and dramatic clubs in Europe and the Middle East and to Institutes and Anglophil Societies in Ibero-America. A large con signment of plays for reading and acting has been despatched to the British West Indies for distribution at the discretion of the Council’s West Indian Repre sentatives. e. Films The Council has continued the production of films designed to show the British way of living. The series of films for use in classrooms, which was begun last year, is being expanded in order that the Council may offer a coherent programme of educational films to teachers who wish to make the film one of their instruments of teaching. Teaching notes are being prepared and will be issued with the films. Britain has established a technique of instructional film production which has no superior ; and it is hoped that the Council will be able to meet some of the many requests for purely educational films that reach the Film Department from overseas educational depart ments, whilst at the same time maintaining its output of films of a more general character. NEW PRODUCTION 1. Newsreels. British news (the Council’s composite British newsreel) continues to be regularly distributed each week, with the co-operation of the Colonial Office and the Ministry of Information, to British Colonies. Copies are also sent to H.M. Embassy in Lisbon. 2. Documentaries. The following films were com pleted and distributed during the quarter under review : The People's Land (colour) The work of the National Trust Maize (educational) .. The life history of maize Newt (educational) .. The life cycle of the newt Market Town (educational) The following films were in active production : 1. Royal Institution (colour) 2. Mechanisation of Agriculture (colour) 3. Origins of the English Language 4. Town Planning 5. Indian Ocean (colour) 6. Mould (educational) 7. Rabbit (educational) A number of other films are in different stages of preparation before going into production. DISTRIBUTION During the quarter 620 prints of Council films were despatched to 67 territories. Commentaries are recorded in eight languages. THEATRICAL One hundred and fifty-nine prints were despatched for cinemas in 53 territories of which some were duplicating prints. Reports of the showing of Council films in public theatres in foreign countries are, with rare exceptions, uniformly satisfactory. NON-THEATRICAL Four hundred and sixty-one prints were dispatched to educational authorities and other institutions in 29 territories including Sweden, Iceland, Portugal, Switzer land, Turkey, South America and the Dominions and Colonies ; 106 prints have been dispatched to Turkey alone in response to many requests for educational films for non-theatrical distribution throughout schools and Halkevis. Increasing use of the Council’s films is being made in South American schools. The demand from foreign countries for the type of film distributed by the Council increases, and the Council continues to receive many appreciative comments on the films sent out. The following quotations are typical of many letters received : Argentina: In a recent report the Director of the Asociacion Argentina de Cultura fnglesa stated : “ Last night our first film show of the season took place with great success, for there was an absolutely packed house once again . . . our hall contains 200 seats. All these were occupied and there were 40 or 50 people standing at the back and round the sides.” Haiti: The British Minister reports that of publicity material supplied, “ ... there is no doubt that films are the most valuable They are invariably received with enthusiasm by Port-au-Prince audiences as I can personally affirm, and after being shown in the Capital they are sent to the outposts and provincial towns . . South Africa : “ These films have not only been enjoyed, they have set out to accomplish what is their intention, e.g., to instruct us as we greatly need. The films have been shown to scholars of all ages, to mixed adult audiences and they have been exceed ingly well received . . . results are improving almost daily, as those who take part are learning to observe more acutely and listen more carefully . . . .” (The Principal, E. P. Baumann School, Johannesburg). S. Rhodesia : The Information Officer : “ I have shown your British Council films to a number of audiences, and they have been highly impressed with their quality and range. I am con vinced that they will greatly help to strengthen further the bonds between this country and Britain by giving both young and old here illuminating glimpses of a country many of them have never seen but to which . . . they are deeply attached . . .” Turkey : The Council’s Representative in Turkey has reported: “ We inaugurated our 16mm. projector by a private film show to a party brought by the Minister of Education. The filrr^ shown included (at the Minister’s request) four of those oP physical training subjects sent to me by you ; they enjoyed a marked success and the Minister has instructed his Director of Physical Training to use them as a model for two films which he is planning . . .” In another report he writes : “ In Angora during April the Council’s films were displayed on 16 occasions to 22,000 people, all Moslem Turks, including the Minister of Education and his staff and pupils of as many as 30 schools. Many more films are urgently needed.” Uruguay : The enterprising Film Department of the Monte video Institute continues to arrange shows for schools, hospitals, local institutes and institutions of every kind. Since the beginning of January, 33 exhibitions have been arranged. DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM Almost all the Council’s films are now being distri buted in public cinemas by the major distributing com panies on satisfactory commercial terms. f. Fine Arts children’s exhibitions These Exhibits prepared for Canada, U.S. A. (Georgia), and Brazil, are still on tour. Mr. McCurry, Director of the Canadian National Gallery of Art, writes that he expects to keep the exhibi tion in active service throughout the summer. The collection sent to Georgia was shown in th^ Toledo Museum of Art and the Director wrote in MarchP as follows : “ We now have on exhibition a set of paintings by English children, which we find exceedingly interesting. They have a great deal of solidity and strength, which augurs well for the future of British Art. We are delighted to have this group with us—it is a true inspiration.” ARTS AND CRAFTS The Exhibition of Arts and Crafts was opened at the Metropolitan Museum, New York, on May 20th, the Press View being held on May 18th. The opening, without speeches or ceremony, was well attended by about 650 people. Good reports have been received from the British Library of Information and other sources. Attendance during the first few days was over 400 a day and it was expected that the week-end figures would be higher. The exhibition was the subject of a television pro gramme, just before the opening. Chosen exhibits were taken to the Studio and Mrs. Grace Lovat Fraser was the speaker. Several galleries in the U.S.A. and Canada are anxious to show this exhibition. It is hoped that it15 may be shown in Toledo, Cleveland, Chicago and Boston. EXHIBITION OF MODERN PAINTINGS FOR THE U.S.A. No reports of this exhibition, since the additional paintings from this country were added, have been received, although the Director of the Toledo Museum of Art, wrote on April 27th : “ We are delighted with additional paintings which make a splendid addition to the exhibition, and will I think make it the best showing of contemporary British paintings which this country has seen for a long time.” EXHIBITION OF GRAPHIC ART IN BUENOS AIRES, ETC. The exhibition opened on April 4th. Its fame spread to the provinces and more than one request from pro vincial towns had to be refused, as the tour of the exhibit had already been planned and it was impossible to fit them in. It was, however, decided to show it in Rosario for a week. The exhibition was scheduled to visit Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Montevideo during May, June and July, after which it will go to Santiago and the West coast. EXHIBITION OF GRAPHIC ART IN MADRID Reports of further sales of duplicate prints are still coming in and the final figures of sales in Madrid have not yet been received. The Art Exhibition has been a decided success and has brought a great many new members into the Institute. ^UCEFIELD FUND A drawing by Hubert A. Freeth has been purchased for the collection from the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. A water-colour by William Dring has been purchased from the Exhibition of the Royal Society of Painters in Water-colours. EXHIBITION OF ALLIED ART IN LONDON AND BELFAST These exhibitions are described under “ Work in the United Kingdom.” g. Lectures Mr. T. S. Eliot made a five weeks’ visit to Sweden in April and May. He lectured in Stockholm, Upsala, Lund and Gothenburg, the subjects being “ Poetry, Speech and Music ” and “ Poetry in the Theatre.” He was everywhere most warmly welcomed and entertained and made many useful contacts. The lectures were excep tionally well attended and the press reports were full and favourable. Sir Kenneth Clark, whose successful visit to Sweden in March was recorded in the last Quarterly Report, has been elected an honorary member of the Swedish Royal Academy of Fine Arts. ^The Council’s scheme for a regular service of British ^:turers to Sweden in co-operation with the Ministry of Information is proceeding, and plans are being drawn up for the autumn. Professor Thomas Bodkin visited Spain and Portugal for some weeks during April and May, lecturing on Gainsborough and Reynolds, English Landscape Painting and English Medieval Art. His reception was everywhere excellent, the lectures were well attended and made a great impression : Professor Bodkin also made a number of useful contacts. Many Spanish authorities expressed their pleasure at hearing something of the significance of British Art. Professor Cairns, Nuffield Professor of Surgery at Oxford, visited Spain and Portugal for three weeks in June and lectured on Brain Surgery to scientific audiences in both countries. Full reports of this lecture tour have not yet been received, but at the time of going to press it was proceeding successfully. h. Music DISTRIBUTION OF GRAMOPHONE RECORDS Foundation libraries of gramophone records with notes on the works recorded have been despatched to the Brazilian Cultural Societies at Santos and Curityba, to the Cairo office for use in Egypt and Palestine, to the Windward Islands and the Bahamas.

The photographic dark room, now working to full capacity, is fulfilling its expected purpose of producing better photography at less cost. Mr. Harold White, f.i.b.p., f.r.p.s., has joined the staff of the Unit as a photographer. The Council’s photographic library of 35,000 prints is being extensively used by foreign journalists visiting this country, many of whom have taken away large selections of photographs for reproduction in their own countries. HOME PUBLICITY Publicity in the home press was obtained for the opening of the Exhibitions of Allied Art in London and Belfast, the opening of the Belgian Institute in London, the London Philharmonic Orchestra’s Concert at the Albert Hall in aid of the Colonial Comforts Fund and conducted by the coloured musician, Mr. Rudolf Dunbar and the Cyprus Association Concert.

ANGLO-SOVIET SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION Following the Council’s arrangements for the exchange of scientific information between British and Soviet scientists and scientific institutions, ten individual scientific and technical enquiries have been sent to the U.S.S.R. Lists of Russian scientific periodicals required by Scientific Institutions and Government Departments in this country have also been forwarded to the Soviet Union. The Anglo-Soviet Scientific Collaboration Committee, under the Chairmanship of Sir John Russell, in which Council and the Ministry of Information are jointly c™- cerned, has recommended the compilation of a list of Russian scientific periodicals available in this country and the collection of existing glossaries of Russian- English scientific and technical terms, compiled by various scientific institutions and individuals. In col laboration with the Science Library and the Royal Society of Medicine facilities have been made available for the microfilming of medical and scientific books and periodicals, where these are in short supply or out of print, in order that they may be sent to the U.S.S.R. BROADCASTS A series of four broadcast talks in Portuguese were arranged in collaboration with the B.B.C. to be read during the period of the Science Congress held at Oporto from June 18th to June 24th. The scripts were on British Agriculture, by Sir John Russell, Viruses, by Dr. F. C. Bawden, Chromosomes, by Dr. C. D. Darling ton, and Blood Transfusion Services by Dr. Janet M. Vaughan. A large number of copies of the Portuguese scripts were supplied for distribution in Portugal. GENERAL MATTERS Four pamphlets of the Science in Britain series are in the press and are described under “ Books and Periodicals.” f The material for the Illustrated Brochure of British Engineering Achievement has been collected, and has been edited by Mr. W. O. Skeat. The problems of publication at an early date are being explored. Members of the Engineering Panel have given much valuable advice on developments concerning technical education in Turkey. Pictorial stories of British scientific achievement have been designed for exhibition in Turkey. The themes of Rutherford and the Atom and Parsons and the Turbine are exposed in a series of photographs and explanatory captions. The series can be adapted for exhibition in any country. Members of the Science Committee have advised on films on the Royal Institution and the Steam Engine and the Steam Turbine, which the Council has commissioned. j. Science {including Medicine) Sir Henry Dale, p.r.s., has become Chairman of the Science Committee and Sir John Russell, f.r.s., a member. MEDICINE The number of medical journals in the Spanish language which have published the condensed versions of British medical articles issued in monthly batches (in Spanish) by the Council’s British Medical Information Service is now 64. Apart from their publication injournals, the summaries are filed and consulted in several medical libraries in Spanish-speaking countries. In one of the smaller of these countries, the students at the Faculty of Medicine are said to make use of the summaries in the preparation of their M.D. theses. In Chile, a professional journalist who writes in the general press on medical subjects makes regular use of material sent by the Information Service and has published excellent articles on the progress of medical work in Britain. Further original papers by outstanding British medical scientists have been submitted to and accepted by Latin-American medical journals. The distinguished editor of what is probably the most authoritative medical weekly in the Spanish language, has intimated his willingness to publish any articles of similar quality submitted to him. Following on the recent visit of Sir Harold Gillies to South America, several popular articles on British plastic surgery have been commissioned and sent in Spanish to Argentina and Chile. It has been learnt from the Council’s Representative in Brazil that the Spanish summaries have been trans lated and published in Portuguese in the leading Brazilian surgical journal, but since a service of sum maries in the Portuguese language has recently begun, it may be anticipated that they will be more widely used both in Brazil and Portugal. In Sweden the summaries (sent in English) have been accepted for publication by the most influential and ^lely circulated Scandinavian medical periodical, the editor of which writes that they “ mostly seem to be very suitable for publication in Swedish in this the greatest medical periodical of the North, and I beg to express the appreciation of the periodical.” The Representative in Turkey reports that the English sum maries have been well received. They are being pub lished also in the two leading Canadian medical journals, one in the English and the other in the French languages. The number of medical enquiries received from abroad, whether directly, through diplomatic missions or through Representatives, is increasing and forms a considerable part of the work of the medical department. These enquiries are often from foreign medical institutions of an official character and are dealt with in consultation with the Council’s medical advisers and with the appro priate British medical authorities or experts. Professor Hugh Cairns, Nuffield Professor of Surgery at Oxford, left this country on June 15th for a visit on behalf of the Council to Portugal and Spain. An Argentine doctor who has consistently offered the Council the most valuable collaboration is now in this country studying plastic surgery, and frequent discus sions have been held with him on medical activities in Argentina. Contact is also maintained with other Council medical scholars, of whom there are at present other Argentine, two Chileans and one Peruvian. k. Students Applications for the scholarships offered to women from the Dominions have been received from Canada, New Zealand and South Africa and the final selection will be made early in July by a Selection Committee composed of Heads of Women’s Colleges, Representa tives of the Universities Bureau and the Council. Names of candidates for scholarships for 1942— 43 have also been received from Brazil, Portugal, Uruguay and Venezuela, and those from Turkey, Iceland and Argentina are expected very shortly. Seven students who are unable to return to their own countries have had their scholarships extended for a year so that they may take British degrees. The following students have obtained employment during the period under review : Mr. G. Raptopoulos (Greece) East Mailing Research Station Mr. B. Veinoglou (Greece) National Institute for Research in Dairying Miss Kyriakou (Cyprus) Kindergarten Mistress at Merst ham Mr. B. L. Dunicz (Poland) Research worker in a factory 17 Arrangements are being made for the return of the five Iraqi students who are in this country under the Council’s auspices and of two Cypriot schoolmistresses whose services are urgently required in Cyprus. The Turkish Naval Attache has asked the Council to find training employment for the 44 Turkish naval engineering students who are studying in this country ; arrangements are being made with the co-operation of the Admiralty and the Aliens War Service Department for 18 of them to have experience in works during the summer vacation. At the request of the Naval Attache, an English course has been arranged at the London Halkevi from July to September for 20 of these students. The Council was asked some months ago to investigate the welfare of Iraqi students in the United Kingdom. As recorded previously this investigation was carried out and in due course reported to the Iraqi Government. Through H.M. Ambassador, the Prime Minister of Iraq has expressed his appreciation and thanks. Other activities affecting students are recorded under “ Work in the United Kingdom.” 1.

Visual Publicity EXHIBITIONS The successful exhibition of photographs in Ankara is described under “ Turkey.” Exhibition sets of photographs of a modern secondary school, operating under the Middlesex County Council, of the new Westminster Hospital and the Southampton Civic Centre, originally destined for the Smyrna Fair, were despatched to Turkey and will be exhibited there later. They were accompanied by a full set of plans of the School and a sufficient number of plans of the other two buildings for models to be constructed on the spot. The photographs lay special emphasis on modern ideas of planning, ventilation, space and interior decoration. Duplicate sets were sent to Egypt for exhibition in the Middle East. PHOTOGRAPHS In all about 4,000 other photographs of England and English life were distributed, some large, some small. Those sent at the request of Representatives included a set of six portraits of Whig statesmen for Venezuela, \ 1 ?)Printed by Adams Bros &amp; Shardlow, Ltd., London and Leicester. 18 photographs of the bust of Lister, in the National Portrait Gallery, to be copied by a Portuguese sculptor for the Hospital da Misericordia in Lisbon, and a photograph of a painting of T.

I ADMINISTRATIVE Sir Eric Maclagan and Mr. A. Creech Jones, M.P., have been appointed members of the Executive Com mittee. Mr. H. Orton, formerly lecturer in English at Sheffield University, has been appointed to the staff as Deputy Educational Director. Professor Ifor Evans, Educa tional Director, has left for an inspection of the Council’s establishments in the Middle East, and during his a'diPhce his duties are being undertaken by Professor W. J. Entwistle. Mr. A. Rose, who was for a short time at the Singapore Broadcasting Station, has rejoined the staff of the Council. Professor Starkie, Director of the Institute Britanico Madrid, has been appointed Representative in Spain. Mr. J. Hadfield has been appointed Books Officer in the Middle East, and Mr. H. Paget Assistant Representa tive in the British West Indies. II ACTIVITIES OVERSEAS 1. British Empire and Mandated Territories MALTA Despite the continuous air raids on Malta and the consequent dislocation of services, the membership of the Institute has continued to increase. Mr. W. R. L. Wickham, the Council’s Representative, has received an application from the President of the Government Workers Union in Gozo asking that a branch of the British Institute should be opened in that island at the earliest possible date, to which (in the words of the resolution passed by the Workers Union) “ the pickman or worker and the ploughman should have access.” The Council hopes to satisfy this demand as soon as shortages of staff and equipment can be over come. CYPRUS Mr. K. M. Willey, Acting Representative in Cyprus, returned to England for consultation at the end of July, and spent six weeks in the London Office. During his absence Mr. S. W. White took charge in Cyprus. When the new season opens at the beginning of October certain staff changes will have taken place. Mr. White has gone to Limassol as Director of the new Institute, and Mr. A. W. J. Barron has been transferred from Ky- renia to Nicosia as Assistant Director, where Mr. J. C. Gayford has been appointed Lecturer in English. The Institute at Kyrenia will continue its work under the joint supervision of Mrs. Worcester and Captain Lawton, an assistant master at the English School, who will act as Director of Studies. ADEN Lt.-Col. M. C. Lake, Representative in Aden and Southern Arabia, returned to Aden from leave in August. The most notable event of the quarter was the opening of a women’s branch of the Aden Institute on September 10th. Fifty members have enrolled, and accommoda tion has been found in a spacious flat opposite the main Institute building. Mrs. Madsen, the wife of the Assistant Director of the Aden Institute, has been appointed Director of the women’s branch, which also benefits from supervision by a Standing Committee of ladies presided over by Mrs. Champion, the wife of the Chief Secretary. The programme of the Aden Institute continued with out interruption throughout the summer months. That planned for the new season includes courses in English and Arabic, elementary, colloquial and advanced. It is intended that the Arabic courses shall be correlated with any public examinations which may be established in Aden. The variety and extent of the programmes carried through in the summer months reflect credit on the staff of the Institute. On an average there have been 15 functions each month, besides the regular language classes. Lectures on English and Arabic literature have been given in both languages and a valuable series on First Aid has been given by Dr. K. S. Seal, Acting Civil Surgeon to the Colony ; 17 lectures in these series had been given up to the end of September. Films have been shown at least once a week, and as part of the programme of these evenings there have been short talks on current events. A debating and literary society has held three meetings in September. Mr. Emerson, the Director of the Institute, paid a short visit to Cairo for consultation during July, and undertook an extensive tour of the Hadhramaut in June. His report on the conclusion of this tour has been of value to the Council in considering its policy in Southern Arabia. Mr. H. E. Warrington, Senior English Master at the Government Secondary School, has been appointed Principal, and these two offices will shortly be merged on the retirement of the present Headmaster.2 PALESTINE Mr. J. S. Morrison, the Council’s Representative in Palestine, has established his office in Jerusalem. Mr. R. D. Smith, formerly a Lecturer in the British Institute, Cairo, was seconded to the Palestine Broadcasting Service. The Institutes in Palestine were closed during the greater part of the quarter, and the only detailed reports come from Nazareth and Nablus. The Nablus Institute remained open in July for social activities. The Club was popular and the library much used. The Institute at Nazareth closed for the vacation in the middle of July. Activities up to that date were of the usual type. The ladies’ branch was attended by 90 members, and the English classes included a beginners’ class, a nurses’ class preparing for the Government of Palestine’s Nursing Examination, an advanced conversa tion and pronunciation class. A dressmaking class was held weekly and the weekly lectures continued through July. Mrs. Radley, who is in charge of the ladies’ branch, also arranged country dancing and sewing afternoons. The most recent report from the British Institute at Tel Aviv shows that there are some 697 students at the Institute. The usual social programme is arranged. During the Institute’s last session four chamber music concerts were given by leading members of the Palestine orchestra. There was also a recital of English madrigal music by the Jerusalem Madrigal Society under the leadership of Mr. Richard Graves. Joint activities have been arranged with the British Institute at Jaffa. WEST INDIES Mr. F. D. Gray, Administrative Representative, and Mr. Harold Stannard, Cultural Adviser, arrived recently in Jamaica, having previously consulted the Comptroller for Development and Welfare in the West Indies and his advisers during a short stay in Barbados. Mr. Gray has established an office in Kingston. The Council has appointed Mr. Hugh Paget to be Assistant Representa tive in the West Indies ; in the first instance, he will be stationed in Jamaica. Mr. Paget has had extensive experience in the West Indies and has until recently been in charge of the Jamaica Department of the West India Committee. EAST AFRICA Mr. Malcolm Guthrie, who is on his way to the British East African territories, has arrived in Leopoldville. 2. Foreign Countries a. Europe U.S.S.R. The work of the Council affecting the Soviet Union is recorded for the most part under the respective functional headings in Part IV of this Report. In brief, it was as follows : The arrangements in this country for the estab lishment or resumption of exchanges between the All Union Lenin Library and various British Universities and institutions were concluded and a considerable number of publications of various kinds were sent to Moscow. Books are being assembled for the Central Library of Foreign Literature in Moscow. Specimen or review copies of new books are being sent to the Writers’ Union of the U.S.S.R. British composers have replied to the message received from their Soviet colleagues, further supplies of music have been sent in response to Soviet requests, and a number of scores of modern Soviet orchestral and other works have been received from Russia in exchange for the music already sent. The Soviet Ambassador received the Secretary-General of the Council and during the interview expressed his thanks for the work done by the Council for Soviet merchant seamen in this country. That work continues. Mme. Maisky attended the reception at the Royal Society of Medicine for Allied medical and scientific workers, and the meeting at which distinguished British com posers signed their reply to the message from Soviet composers. Material for a photographic exhibition of some size has been sent to H.M. Embassy at Kuibyshev with many books and periodicals. A considerable number are known to have arrived safely. The work of the Anglo-Soviet Scientific Collaboration Committee continues. ICELAND The Representative, Dr. Cyril Jackson, visited England during the Long Vacation for leave and discussions with the Council. Miss Kathleen Long, the pianist, arrived in Iceland at the end of September to give a series of recitak throughout the island. PORTUGAL The number of members of the British Institute in Portugal at Lisbon increased to 1,753. The Annual Examinations of the Institute terminated on July 3rd English examinations were also held at Oporto Univer sity and at the Industrial Institute, Oporto. From the Library in Lisbon, the number of books lent for home reading during July and August was 1,575, compared with 1,163 in 1941, 870 in 1940, and 541 in 1939. A second Refresher Course for Portuguese Teachers of English was held in Lisbon under the patronage of the Institute para a Alta Cultura, from August 8th to 22nd. All British Council Officers in Portugal (Lisbon, Coimbra and Oporto) took part. Eighteen Portuguese teachers, drawn from all parts of Portugal, attended a varied programme of lectures and social activities, w The English-Portuguese section of the new edition of Padre Julio Albino Ferreira’s standard dictionary, revised by Dr. Jose Luiz Afonso, in collaboration with the Sala Inglesa, was published during this period, and the Portuguese-English section is in preparation. It is expected that the complete work will be the most useful and accurate dictionary of the size in the two languages. Borrowings have averaged 343 monthly from the Library at Coimbra, which now comprises 5,508 books. Showing of Council films at the local cinema, which holds 650 people, have drawn larger audiences than the cinema could seat. Dr. E. R. Reynolds arrived from England to take the place of Mr. D. J Brass, who has been transferred from Coimbra to the Lisbon Institute. Mr. G. L. Thorp arrived to take up his duties as Headmaster of St. Julian’s School, Carcavellos, and Mr. Cartledge to take up his post at the Lisbon Institute. Mr. G. B. Gogay was appointed Boxing and Physical Training Instructor to the Institute on the termination of his service with the Mocidad Portuguesa. Messrs. Downes, Byrne, and Graham returned to England on short leave. Mr. Philip Newman is also visiting England. SPAIN As the summer quarter coincides with a perio&lt;W&gt;t vacations there were less activities at the Institute than in the previous quarter. Nevertheless, over 120 students, double the number of last year, enrolled for the summer course, which began in the first week of August and ended on September 17th. The majority were the employees of ministries, banks, and warehouses, who were eager to improve their knowledge of English. During the Course, two dances were held at the Institute for students. One of the features of the classes has been a series of lantern lectures by Mr. Howard. It is also interesting to note how popular the use is of the record of English Folk Song in the various classes. An unofficial course was organized at Zarauz, a watering place near San Sebastian patronized by Madrid people. The course was under the supervision of Mr. C. G. Goldie and was a welcome innovation. Many alterations have been made this summer in the Institute Building to accommodate the ever-growing numbers. The number of students on the books, not counting the summer course students, is 762, and the membership of the Institute has increased to 420.The library has developed considerably, and is greatly patronized not only by Spanish students and members, but also by specialists who wish to consult English books on special subjects. Mr. Traversi has devoted much of his time to the work of guiding students and professors who come from other Institutes to consult the books. At the end of August the early batches of books arrived for the book exhibition which it is hoped to hold in the Institute in the late autumn. SWEDEN Mr. Charlesworth attended a Summer Course at Tarne People's High School from June 1st to 8th as a visiting lecturer. He also visited W.E.A. and Trade Unions’ summer courses at Brunnsvik People’s High School from June 9th to July 11th. The Rectors of these schools have expressed their gratitude for the co-opera tion of the British Council. The third annual Summer School for teachers and university students of English at Sigtuna was opened by the British Minister on June 30th. 141 applications were received, an advance of 57 on 1941. The number of 100 was fixed for resident students. Mr. Bottrall, the Repre sentative in Sweden, acted as the Director of Studies and was assisted by 12 teachers among whom were the lektors at Uppsala, Lund, Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Helsingfors. In addition to lectures given by the staff, a number of prominent Swedes were invited to speak on subjects connected with English cultural history. The course closed on July 28th. ^Financial support was given to the Summer Courses organized by the Kursverksamhet (University Extension Courses) at the University College of Stockholm. Six courses in all have taken place during the months of August and September : a week’s residential course at Viggbyholm near Stockholm (85 members) ; a course in Stockholm for teachers of English (two weeks, 35 members) ; four evening courses at Stockholm, (three weeks, 130 members), Gothenburg (three weeks, 100 members), Vasteras (two weeks, 90 members), and Norrkoping (two weeks, 60 members). Most of the Sigtuna staff co-operated with the Kursverksamhet teachers in these courses, which were an unqualified success. A room has been provided by the Council in order that classes in English may be given to members of the Stockholm Rugby Club by Mr. J. K. Reuterdahl, of the British Consulate-General. During the quarter the Council has welcomed to England as its guests the editors of six leading Swedish newspapers under the directorship of Dr. Pauli, as well as the Swedish publishers Dr. Sven Erik Bergh and Mr. Kaj Bonnier. Orchestral scores have been obtained for Konsert- foreningen at Stockholm, and scores of modern English chamber music for Fylkingen, the leading chamber music society. Gramophone records of classical and i^ht music have been obtained for Radiotjanst. Mr. M. R. Snodin was appointed a British Council teacher on loan to the Kursverksamhet at Stockholms Hdgskola and Mrs. Francina Cameron has been appointed Administrative Assistant to the Council Representative in place of Mr. Doese. b. The Middle East At the end of June, on the instructions of the Minister of State, the Council’s Middle East office was moved from Cairo to Jaffa. A skeleton staff remained in Cairo to deal with that part of the work which is chiefly con cerned with Egypt. Mr. C. A. F. Dundas, the Repre sentative in the Middle East, with Mr. Simon, Assistant Representative, remained in Cairo for the greater part of the quarter. Mr. R. N. Hollyer, Assistant Representa tive, returned to Egypt. Mr. John Hadfield, formerly Editorial Manager at J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, has been appointed Books Officer in the Middle East in the place of Mr. Egerton Sykes, and Mr. C. T. Middleton, formerly of the Malayan Civil Service has arrived in Cairo to act as an Assistant Representative in the Middle East office. Mr. R. D. Chancellor has also been appointed in an administrative capacity. The Council enabled twelve members of its Middle East staff to attend a course in Islamics held at Beirut University. Mr. Dundas was present for the opening of the course. EGYPT The majority of the Institutes in Egypt closed in July for the hottest months of the summer, so that only a limited number of reports have been received. The British Institute, Cairo, remained open throughout the quarter, mainly for the holding of examinations, as did the Alexandria and Port Said Institutes. At Alexandria the Institute carried on a full programme of social activities. In July the threat to Alexandria was acute, but the Institute continued to function successfully. In August 273 students registered for the Summer Course, in which classes were given in elementary, intermediate, and advanced English, and in literature, shorthand, and commercial English. The intermediate Bachelor of Commerce class also restarted. The lectures during this month were well attended, and at a social on the last Saturday in August 150 students were present. The Summer Course at the Port Said Institute began on July 1st, and though the military situation affected attendance, classes were maintained, and 67 students attended. A full lecture programme was arranged. At the end of July a music recital was enthusiastically received. Seventeen candidates took part in the Pitman’s shorthand and typewriting examinations, which were held in July. The Council has allocated funds to enable the furniture and equipment at the British Institute, Mehalla, to be improved. The Club of the Institute at Tanta reopened in August and was attended by the 30 or so members who had not gone on holiday. A number of British troops have been using the Institute and have mixed well with the Club members. Mr. J. B. West has been appointed Director of the British Boys’ Club in Cairo, the establishment of which was approved in the previous quarter. IRAQ British Institute, Bagdad .—There was no teaching in July as the Institute was closed except for the reading room. At the White Lodge (the club premises) special tuition was given to 30 secondary school boys who had failed in English in their examinations. This action was much appreciated by the Iraqi Minister of Education. Of the club functions held in the garden of the White Lodge, mention should be made of the lectures on “ Cyprus,” by John Chaplin ; “ The Progress of the War,” by Colonel Boyce ; “ The Psychology of Peace and War,” by Professor H. R. Hamley ; “ Courts of Law,” by Judge R. A. Campbell ; and “ Science and Man,” by Professor Hawkins. The weekly pianoforte recitals by Professor Julian Hertz and the fortnightly open-air film shows were continued. British Institute, Mosul .—The Institute was kept going despite the great heat of mid-summer. Classes were suspended at the beginning of July, and shortly after examinations were held in all classes. These were attended by 54 students. The club and social activities of the students included a “ Brain’s Trust ” meeting, lectures, a showing of the film “ Pimpernel Smith,” and a musical programme. The British Institute Club, with its headquarters in the building of the former French Consulate, was inaugurated, and at present members number 75, of whom 45 are Iraqis. A Managing Committee, of three British and three Iraqi members, has been elected to organize the social activities. The swimming pool and tennis court, which are amongst the Club's amenities, are in constant use. PERSIA Mr. J. S. Bingley arrived in Teheran at the beginning of August to investigate the possibilities of an extension of the Council’s activities in Persia.4 TURKEY 1. Teaching. This season is normally a vacation period, but in view of the enthusiasm of the Turkish pupils and authorities alike, no less than seventeen of the Council’s previously established courses remained open during all or at least two-thirds of the summer. These are the following Bogazi^i Lycee, Istanbul ; the Air Force classes at Resadiye, Smyrna ; The Merkez and Ottoman Banks, Smyrna ; and the Halkevis of Afyonkarahissar, Ankara, Bornova, Brusa, Qanakkale, Emindnii, Gallipoli, Giresun, Konya, Samsun, Sivas, Smyrna (central and Tillkillik). In addition to these, and in spite of the rigours of the Anatolian summer, the following seven new courses were started :—The Air School and War School at Eskisehir ; the Chamber of Commerce, Smyrna ; and the Halkevis of Eregli, Eskisehir, Isparta (where a local Council teacher replaced a transferred Party teacher), and Karaman (short course). Owing to the impossibility of replacing local teachers mobilized or transferred, courses at Dinar, Edirne, and Mustafakemalpasa were suspended ; new teachers were found for Biga and Konya, and negotiations are pro ceeding for the inauguration of new classes at Adana and Balikesir. As a result of conversations with the People’s Party, Ministry of Education, and General Staff, joint action has been agreed upon regarding the provincial Halkevi courses. University appointments, organization of the Turk Maarif Cemiyeti Lycee, and military and other courses. The People’s Party have recently announced their acceptance of the Council’s programme for English teaching in about forty Halkevis during the coming academic year. 2. Photograph Exhibitions. After its display at Ankara, the Council’s Exhibition of Photographs of British Educa tional Institutions was transported to Smyrna, where the People’s Party arranged an exhibition in the Halkevi. It was opened by the Halkevi President and attracted very large crowds, including the Governor and Mayor of Smyrna, the Generals commanding the Army Corps and Air Brigade, and the new Minister of Commerce, Dr. Behcet Uz. The collection of photographic views of England pro vided by the Ministry of Information and the Council also previously displayed at Ankara, was exhibited at C^anakkale Halkevi. Other exhibitions of photographs illustrating British Institutions were held at Brusa and Eskisehir Halkevis, and in each case speeches were made by the Halkevi Presidents at crowded opening ceremonies. Each of these four exhibitions was an entirely new departure for the towns concerned, none of which had ever before seen a foreign exhibition. The experiment appears to have pleased the People’s Party, which has arranged further British exhibitions. 3. Books. In spite of events in Egypt, the dispatch of books by the Cairo office will not, so far as can be seen at present, have fallen short of the previous quarter’s total of 6,200. Substantial consignments have also been dispatched from England. By means of the consign ments of the present quarter, permanent agreements of a character satisfactory to British interests have been made with the three Turkish bookshops of Ankara. The Council’s newly appointed Books Officer in Istanbul has spent the quarter in working for a similar result, mutatis mutandis, in that city, and the Governor of Smyrna has approved the titles of books to be sold to the public there. Consignments of books have also been sent to the bookshops of the principal provincial capitals, and one arrived at Eskisehir just in time to be displayed in the Halkevi by the Council teacher there, at a special visit by the President of the Republic. The experiment of founding lending libraries at Ankara (“ Oilmen ”) and Istanbul (“ Tulin ”), which originated from the increasing scarcity of serious books, has, in spite of difficulties arising from local conditions, proved highly successful, and the total number of purely Turkish subscribers already exceeds 200. To meet the special needs of Istanbul, a third library has been opened in the Beyoglu (Pera) quarter. Half the books in the “ Beyoglu ” library are provided by the British Red Cross Committee, to which the library is providing a monthly subvention. 4. Periodicals. In June 150 different periodicals were being dispatched and distributed regularly by the Council in one or numerous copies. This number has again considerably increased, and all Council distribution in Turkey, of which part was hitherto undertaken direct from London, is now centred at the Ankara Office, which is distributing between 4,000 and 5,000 copies of specialist magazines every month to Turkish Ministries, Faculties, Institutes, individuals, and bookshops. It is now clear which periodicals are most appreciated in Turkey, and supplies of these are being increased accordingly. (5) Films. The Council’s Ankara programme con tinued to attract audiences of between 1,000 and 2,000 for the first part of July, during which also, special dis plays of football films were arranged for Fenerbah^e Club, Istanbul, by the Director-General of the Anatolic Agency. An entire reorientation of film distribution was then completed to meet the special conditions of the summer months, in which the large provincial capitals take the place of the three principal cities as the leading centres. Fresh ground has thus been broken during the summer by the display of films to large audiences at Samsun, Eskisehir, Balikesir, Zonguldak, Brusa, Gallipoli, Eregli, Bakirkoy, Sivas, Nazilli, Aydin, and Soke, censorship restrictions being overcome in each case. A consecu tive estimate of audiences for the summer month^Js 80,000. (6) Lectures. The lecture programme at Smyrna, a new departure, was continued, and five lecturers gave two lectures each, Turkish translations being read after the English original in every case. All the principal officials of the town attended, and subsequently met the lecturer at entertainments arranged by the Council. Professor Ronald Syme created a further precedent by lecturing on the Ancient History of Anatolia at the Halkevis of Samsun and Brusa, where no English lecturers had been seen before. Members of the Council staff also lectured at these centres. Professor A. K. Mcllwraith and Mr. R. T. Butlin concluded their programme of summer courses for English teachers at Ankara and Istanbul. (7) Publications. During the quarter much work has been put into preparing numerous publications, all of which should have appeared by this time next year. The Council’s two existing periodicals in Turkey were success fully maintained. (8) Appointments and Movements. Mr. R. Syme has been appointed Professor of Ancient History and Litera ture, and Professor T. Royds Professor of Astronomy, at Istanbul University, and Mr. A. C. R. Ritchie, Profes^r of Electricity and Adviser to the Under-Secretary*f Technical Education at Ankara. Mr. S. C. Plume arrived from England to take up his appointment as Chief Accountant. Mr. A. R.

Three fixtures of special importance took place :—On July 29th, students of Turkish from the School of Oriental Studies were enter tained by Turkish students ; on September 15th, the Turkish Ambassador held a reception for the five Turkish editors visiting this country ; and on September 24th, 12^headmistresses and mistresses from L.C.C. schools were entertained to tea, after which they were addressed by Sir Wyndham Deedes on Modern Turkey, and invited to arrange for their pupils to visit the Halkevi. c. Ibero-America ARGENTINA Sir Eugen Millington-Drake arrived in Buenos Aires to take up his duties as Chief Representative in Spanish speaking America after a two-months’ journey from Washington. He had visited Mexico, Guatemala, San Salvador, Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Quito, Guayaquil, Lima, and La Paz, and established friendly relations in regard to cultural matters with the appropriate local authorities, besides lecturing and broadcasting in Spanish, and attending press conferences. Sir Eugen made a tour of Salta, Tucuman, and Santiago del Estero, the capitals of the three provinces of Northern Argentina. Through his visit to Tucuman an Associa tion of English Culture has been founded, and Mr. Targett-Adams transferred from Colombia to become its Director. The Asociacion Argentina de Cultura Inglesa main tains its usual activities, and an extensive and varied programme of lectures was arranged for the 1942 season. A Jending library of gramophone records has been esftlished. The cultural year of the Asociacion Argentina de Cultura Britanica at Cordoba was opened in May by its President, Dr. Novillo Corvalan. A full programme of lectures has been arranged and the Council has agreed to meet the expenses of lecturers travelling from Buenos Aires to address the Association. The cultural as well as the teaching side of the Association’s activities is being successfully developed. The Asociacion Rosarina de Cultura Inglesa continues to expand. BOLIVIA Sir Eugen Millington-Drake visited La Paz. He had cordial interviews with the President of the Republic, the Minister of Education, and other Ministers of State. Sir Eugen gave three broadcast talks during his stay—the first on “ Bolivian Culture,” introduced by the Minister of Education ; the second on “ The British Council,” introduced by the Rector of the University ; and the third on “ Sports,” introduced by the Director of the Anglo-Bolivian Cultural Institute. BRAZIL There are now five Societies in Brazil, at Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, and Santos, whilst at Bahia, Miss Macrae is supervising the Council’s work until a Society can be formed. Nearly 5,000 students attend the classes of these Societies. Further evidence of the desire to learn English is a recent decree making the teaching of English compulsory for three, instead of two, years in Brazilian secondary schools. The most recently formed Society, at Santos, already has over 300 students. This Society has a distinguished Board of Directors, the President being Dr. Ismael Coelho de Sousa ; the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Education and the Interventor of the State of Sao Paulo are amongst its patrons. The Rio Society has taken additional accommodation. A feature of its activities during the past quarter was the musical recitals given by one of the teachers, Mr. Fuller. They attracted considerable attention in Brazilian musical circles, and Mr. Fuller is to visit the provincial Societies. Another of the Rio teachers, Mr. Blackstone, has given a series of lectures at the University of Brazil on “ English Novelists and Poets.” Dr. Edmundo Penna Barbosa e Silva, former British Council scholar and now at the Brazilian Foreign Office, gave a lecture at the Rio de Janeiro Society on “ A Brazilian at Cambridge.” H.M. Ambassador was present. It is anticipated that, through the kind permission of Oxford University, Professor Radcliffe-Brown will continue for another year to be visiting lecturer in Social Anthropology at the Escola Livre de Sociologia, Sao Paulo. At Rio de Janeiro he inaugurated a course of anthropology at the Casa do Estudante do Brasil, and was the guest of honour at the first anniversary celebra tions of the Sociedade Brasileira de Antropologia. The Council records its appreciation of the work of Professor Radcliffe-Brown, who, in addition to his duties at the Escola Livre, has taken on the post of Executive Director of the Sao Paulo Society. The exhibition of Children’s Drawings which had already been shown in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Belo Horizonte, was exhibited successfully at Porto Alegre. Senhor Armando de Sa Pires has been appointed Personal Assistant to the Representative. Professor Horner of the S2o Paulo Society, has been transferred to Montevideo, and Mr. Metford has arrived at Santos to assist the Director, Mr. Jolliffe. The Council records its appreciation of the continued encouragement given to the work in Brazil by H.M. Ambassador, Sir Noel Charles, who, besides his frequent visits to the Rio de Janeiro Society has been to Belo Horizonte and Sao Paulo, where he visited both the Society and St. Paul’s School. COLOMBIA The second conference of Institute Directors took place in Bogota. These conferences are to become an annual event. Reports from the Directors of the Institutes at Medellin, Cali, and Santa Marta show that excellent progress continues to be made. The Institute at Medellin has 382 students and the Music Committee of this Institute has purchased a piano from its own funds. It has been necessary to take extra accommodation for the Bogota Institute. Mr. Targett-Adams has been transferred to Argentina and Mr. Clements has been appointed Director of the Barranquilla Institute. The Representative in Colombia has received a personal letter from the Colombian Minister of Educa tion in which he warmly thanks him for the Council’s offer of scholarships for the academic year 1942-43. CENTRAL AMERICA Presentations of books were made to the national libraries of Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico,6 Nicaragua, Panama, and El Salvador. Text-books, book prizes, and medals were presented to the English- American School at Guatemala. CHILE The Chilean-British Institute at Santiago conducts 58 classes, for which 832 students have so far enrolled. The Institute can now offer a complete commercial training, and there has been a large increase in the number of students in the Commercial Section. A Summer School for 91 students was held at the beginning of the year. This will become a regular feature. Extra-mural classes were organized for eight institutions in Santiago. The Chilean-British Institute at Valparaiso reports a considerable advance in the number of its students, largely due to its move into new premises. The Institute organized a well-attended Summer School, and extra mural classes were given in two institutions in the town. The newly founded Chilean-British Institute at Con cepcion continued to make satisfactory progress with 155 students. Mr. George Jones, the Honorary Co-ordinator of the Council’s work in Chile, completed a tour of Northern Chile, and reports the foundation in Anto fagasta of an Institute Chileno-Anglo-Norteamericano with 160 students in the English classes. The Council is presenting a collection of books to the Institute. Mr. Jones records that the number of children attend ing the Antofagasta British School is 160, and that the English Academy at Iquique has 60 pupils. The rapid growth of St. Margaret’s Girls’ School, Valparaiso, has made it necessary to rent additional premises. This School now has 155 pupils, as against 65 in March, 1941, when it was opened. ECUADOR During the course of a visit to Cuenca, the third city of Ecuador, H.M. Minister at Quito visited the Univer sity, where four classes in English are conducted under the auspices of the Council for 160 students. PARAGUAY Mr. J. H. Stevens, who at the request of H.M. Minister established English classes in Asuncion in March of this year, has been appointed Assistant Director of the newly founded Anglo-Paraguayan Cultural Centre in that city. This Centre was inaugurated when Sir E. Millington- Drake recently visited Asuncion. The Centre has 140 pupils in nine classes and plans are being made to expand the cultural and social side of its activities. With its establishment, the Council is now in touch with at least one Anglophil Society in each South American republic. PERU Dr. Mackay, the holder of the Chair of English at the University of San Marcos, Lima, reports a very satis factory year for the English Chair. Specimen text-books for the teaching of English are being presented to the Ministry of Education. The Council has agreed to subsidize the salary of a full-time teacher of English at the British-Peruvian Cultural Association of Southern Peru at Arequipa. URUGUAY Sir Eugen Millington-Drake paid a short visit to Montevideo, and was granted audiences with the Pre sident of the Republic, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of Public Instruction. Social activities' arranged by the Anglo-Uruguayan Cultural Institute at Montevideo included a series of lectures on English Literature by Mr. Bernard Groom, Professor of English at Montevideo University. Conversation teas and com munity singing are among the most popular of the Insti tute’s attractions, which include gramophone record recitals, film exhibitions and the library. The Spanish classes and English radio programmes continue. The exhibition of engravings sent out by the Council was a great success, and was visited by 35,000 people. Professor Horner, transferred from Brazil, has arrived at Montevideo to take up his duties as Assistant to the Director of the Institute there. The Anglo-Uruguayan Cultural Institute at Rivera has been reorganized under its new Director, Mr. D MacGillycuddy, and has 100 pupils and 80 members as against 50 pupils and 19 members in April of this year' VENEZUELA Mr. P. M. H. Edwards has been appointed Assistant to the Director of the Venezuelan-British Cultural Institute at Caracas. The social side of the Institute was developed with an average of one function a week, the majority of them film shows or lectures. An important ceremony took place on June 23rd, the eve of the anniversary of the Battle of Carabobo, which brought about the emancipation of Venezuela. The guests, who were received by H.M. Minister, numbered 180 ; members of the Institute, descendants of members of the British Legion which played an important part in the battle, and important officials such as the President of the Academy of History and representatives of the Foreign Office, the Ministry of War, and the Ministry of Education. Dr. Santiago Key Ayala, the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Institute, delivered a brilliant speech. He was followed by the Director of Culture in the Ministry of National Education, who read despatches describing the services rendered by the heroic British Legion. The whole cere mony made a considerable impression and was given great publicity in the press. ^ H.M. Minister at Caracas reports that at the end of August a great honour was paid to the Institute, when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Caracciolo Parra- Perez, gave a lecture there on “ Miranda and His Times.” This was a red-letter day in the annals of the Institute, which was filled almost to capacity to hear Dr. Parra- Perez’s lecture, in which he gave evidence of great scholarship and historical research. Among the 300 to 400 persons present were almost all the Heads of Missions of the Latin-American countries, as well as representa tives of the United States Mission and of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and other Government Departments and heads of many learned bodies. This function attracted much attention in the press, and brought the activities of the Institute prominently before the public. d. Other Countries CHINA Interesting reports continue to be received from Mr. E. R. Hughes, Reader in Chinese Religion and Philo sophy at Oxford, who is proceeding with investigation in China on the Council’s behalf with a view to the further development of their activities in that country. At the invitation of the Academia Sinica, Dr. Jo^ph Needham, Reader in Bio-Chemistry at Cambridge fmi- versity, is about to leave for Chungking as a visiting pro fessor. Dr. Needham will spend a few weeks in the United States before proceeding to China, to establish contact with American bodies interested in promoting present and post-war co-operation between the Chinese and Western Allied peoples. Professor E. R. Dodds, Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford University, has left for Chungking by a direct route on a similar mission. Both he and Dr. Needham are the bearers of duplicate addresses from the Univer sities of Oxford and Cambridge, the Royal Society, and the British Academy to the Academia Sinica, from the Universities Bureau of the British Empire to the Univer sities of China, from the School of Oriental and African Studies to the Minister of Education in Chungking, from the University Teachers of Great Britain to the teachers of China, and from the Lord Mayor of Bristol to the Chief Magistrate of Chungking. These addresses have been translated and inscribed in Chinese characters by the School of Oriental and African Studies, whose collaboration the Council gratefully acknowledges.As recorded under “ Students,” the Chinese students to come to this country are being selected by the Com mittee in Chungking appointed for this purpose. JAPAN Mr. Frank Hawley, formerly Director of the British Library of Information and Culture in Tokio has been repatriated, and has arrived in England. BELGIAN CONGO The Representative, Mr. F. Y. Thompson, has had to resign his post in Leopoldville for reasons of health, and is being transferred to Teheran. Mr. G. Humphreys Roberts has been teaching in Leopoldville, and Mrs. C. M. Lester has been transferred from Egypt to take over Mr. Thompson’s administrative duties provisionally. Mr. A. T. Baker acted as Representative during the month of August, and Mr. Guthrie spent the month of September in Leopoldville on his way to East Africa. PORTUGUESE WEST AFRICA At the request of a group of Portuguese nationals, and with the approval of the Portuguese authorities, the Council have taken a house in Loanda as premises for an Anglo-Portuguese Club and English classes. Arrange ments are being made to send an English teacher to Loanda as soon as possible. A special library of British Council films has been presented to the Canadian Army for distribution to units. Arrangements have been made whereby E.N.S.A. supply entertainment films to Allied Brigades and the Council supply films for educational purposes. Books and Periodicals The presentation of books and periodicals, particu larly those of a professional character, has been con tinued to all categories of visiting armed forces, civilians and merchant seamen. A scheme by which supplies of literature are made available to merchant seamen in hospital is now in operation in many parts of the United Kingdom. For example, in the Newcastle area 1,964 packets of literature have been sent to 267 patients representing 27 different nationalities. In the Glasgow area literature has been provided to American, Arabian, Belgian, Brazilian, Canadian, Chinese, Danish, Estonian, Finnish, French, Greek, Indian, Newfoundland, Palestinian, Polish, South African, Swedish, and West Indian seamen. The first translations of pamphlets in various Allied languages are now ready. The shortage of books in European Allied languages has meant that for many months there has been no literature available for those who cannot read English. The Council’s publications have therefore been appreciated. Ill ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM ^ Staff Mr. Charles Wilmot was transferred on September 22nd from the North of England and North Wales to take up his duties as Regional Officer for the South- West of England and South Wales. A Regional Officer for the North of England and North Wales will be appointed shortly. Mr. Alec Parkin-Moore has been appointed Liaison Officer for National Houses in the London area under the Regional Officer. Mr. Dudley-Ryder and Mr. Harold Tudor have been appointed to the staffs of the Regional Officer for London, East Anglia, and the Home Counties and the Regional Officer for Northern England and North Wales to assist with special functions, the press, and public relations in those areas. Mr. Young has been appointed to the staff of the Council’s Glasgow Office. Miss Sydney has been trans ferred from the Film Department to assist at the Allied Centre, Liverpool. Teaching of English Teachers of English have been appointed to the Islamic Cultural Centre in London, to Civilian Refugees in London, to the Anglo-Belgian Club, Swansea, to a Polish Naval Barracks, and to a special unit of the Belgian Air Force. ^her items referring to the teaching of English are recorded under separate headings.

Americans Turkish Halkevi Newfoundlanders No. of Pro grammes 52 104 45 24 55 11 14 20 25 7 8 5 Total 370 Lectures Details of lectures arranged in National Houses and other centres are recorded elsewhere. In several areas the method of open forum has been tried with success, particularly amongst Allied groups of the armed forces ; in others, lectures of a comparative na t U re—that is to say, lectures at which a British and Allied lecturer have spoken on the same institution draw ing comparisons between the British institution and that of the Allied country concerned. The lecture notes and illustrations prepared by the Council are in great demand, particularly from Educa tion Officers attached to isolated units of the armed forces. In connection with various Allied Exhibitions assist ance has been given to Allied representatives to lecture to large British audiences, in schools and elsewhere. In Manchester a special course on the United Nations was arranged on September 22nd, 23rd and 24th in collaboration with the Director of Education for the Manchester area. Approximately 150 children attended the course in school time and lectures were given by distinguished representatives from the United States, China, U.S.S.R., Norway, Poland and Czechoslovakia. Film programmes were provided in connection with some of the lectures. The experiment has been so successful that it is hoped to arrange similar courses in collaboration with directors of education elsewhere. A very large number of lectures have been provided for civilian audiences throughout the country. Exhibitions The Exhibition “ Netherlands ” was opened by H.R.H. Crown Prince Bernhard in the National Gallery of Scotland on August 10th. The Exhibition was shown under the auspices of the Netherlands Government and the British Council. The Netherlands Prime Minister and the Chairman of the British Council spoke at the opening ceremony, which was presided over by Lord Rosebery. 23,086 people visited the Exhibition during its stay in Edinburgh. On September 22nd the Exhibition was opened in Glasgow by Rear-Admiral C. Baron de Vos van Steenwijk. Speeches were also made by the Netherlands Minister of Education, Art and Science, and by the Vice- Chancellor and Principal of the University of Glasgow ; the Lord Provost of Glasgow presided.

The Polish Minister of Information, Mr. H. Graham White, M.P., representing the British Council, and the Earl of Elgin, spoke at the opening, the Lord Provost of Edinburgh presiding. On the day after the opening there were over 2,300 visitors. An Exhibition of Polish photographs has been shown under the auspices of the Council in Manchester and Leeds. In Newcastle the Council officers have given much assistance to the City Corporation in securing Allied representatives for an open air pageant depicting the spirit of victory. The Council’s officers in Cornwall gave assistance to the Cornish-Breton demonstrations held in Penzance. Concerts In addition to a regular series at the National Houses, concerts have been arranged in many provincial centres. In some areas special concerts of record music have been given with explanatory lectures. Through the E.N.S.A. International Advisory Council, entertainment has been arranged for Allied naval units and merchant seamen in various ports. Students and Children a. STUDENTS The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Liverpool and the Chairman of the British Council, proposed to the Polish Government that a Polish Faculty of Archi tecture should be established at the Liverpool School of Architecture, in the University of Liverpool. This proposal was accepted by General Sikorski, and the Faculty is in operation. The Council contributes to the payment of examination fees, subscriptions to the Guild of Undergraduates and the supply of instru ments and drawing material. The students for the first year will be twenty men from the Polish army, who need one year to complete their studies for an architectural degree. During the past quarter grants-in-aid have been given to :— 5 Polish post-graduates, 6 undergraduates. 6 Czechoslovak undergraduates. 6 French undergraduates. 1 Chinese post-graduate and 1 undergraduate. 1 Hungarian undergraduate. 1 Dutch undergraduate. 1 Norwegian undergraduate. After consultation with the Allied Governments three special courses have been arranged for the present academic year. (1) A Course in Commerce and Business Methods at the City of London College, mainly to meet the needs of young people who have one year between leaving school and being called up for national service. (2) A further Course on Institutional Management at King’s College of Household and Social Science, Uni versity of London. (3) A special Course in English Literature, Language, History and Institutions at the University of Birmingham. The London School of Economics have generously arranged a six months’ course in Law and Economics for officers and men of the Allied armies. The men will be temporarily released from service to take the course. The Council’s officers in Scotland collaborated with the Universities’ China Committee in arranging for a group of 48 Chinese students to visit Edinburgh and Glasgow. b. SCHOOLCHILDREN During the past quarter scholarships have been given to :— 1 Polish schoolboy. 3 Czechoslovak schoolchildren. 4 Belgian schoolchildren. 1 Dutch schoolgirl. A further scholarship has been offered by Hurstpier- point College for a boy whose father is serving in the Fighting Services of the Allied Forces. The scholarship has been divided between a Polish and a Belgian candi date, the Council paying half the cost. The Polish Hostel in Edinburgh, established jointly by the Polish Board of Education, the Polish Research Centre and the British Council, is now in operation. The boys attend the Royal High School in Edinburgh and Polish teachers deal with their purely Polish education and a Polish chaplain with their religious welfare. Officers of the Council attended Speech Days at the Lycee Fran^ais in Cumberland and the Belgian Boarding School in Buxton. The Council have been requested by the Norwegian Government to appoint a teacher of English to the Norwegian School at Drumtochty Castle. The supply of text books and equipment has continued to all Allied schools and hospitality was arranged for many children from those schools during the Summer Vacation. General Reception, Excursions and Private Hospitality The work of assisting groups of visitors to meet people in this country of similar professions or occupa tions and of affording merchant seamen and service men the opportunities to see institutions, war factories and so on, has steadily increased. In London a register of professional bodies and trade associations has been compiled giving those willing to give assistance to Dominion, Colonial and Allied visitors, and the question of visits to war factories is being thoroughly investigated with the Ministry of SupplyJhd the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Specimens of the type of visits arranged in different areas are : in London members of the Polish National Council have had special tours arranged for them ; Turkish students of engineer ing have visited ship-repairing yards, the offices of the News Chronicle and the Star and a group of Dutch men and one woman who recently escaped from Holland has been entertained. At Newcastle Danish, Norwegian and Russian seamen have been taken to see schools, mines and historic monuments and the Lord Mayor of Newcastle has generously received Polish and Greek naval personnel. In Liverpool excursions have been arranged for United States, Netherlands, Javanese, Polish, French and Belgian personnel. In Brixham 130 Indian seamen were similarly received. Arrangements were made for 500 Polish airmen to visit Oxford in groups of 25. In Cardiff, Norwegian, French and American merchant seamen have made numerous excursions. In other areas there have been visits to plays by Shakespeare with explanatory lectures before-hand. In Glasgow, Burmese, Chinese, Dutch, French Colonial, Gibraltarian, Indian, Javanese, Norwegian, Swedish and United States seamen have had special trips arranged to enable them to see more of Scotland than the dock areas. Numerous requests from service men on leave-fire received by the Council Officers. For example ^he Canadian soldier wished to make contact with an expert connected with the biological aspect of “ big game.” It was arranged for him to meet the world’s leading expert on this subject and to receive all the information he required. National Houses and Other Centres a. POLISH HEARTH i. Concerts. The musical activities of this House have been re-organized in close co-operation with the Polish Musicians of London and the Music Department of the British Council. Instead of weekly concerts alternately of Polish and British music, fortnightly concerts have been arranged combining Polish and British artists. The innovation has proved a great success. The House was lent to the Polish Musicians of London to entertain music lovers among the U.S. forces in London. The guest of honour on this occasion was Mrs. Winant.ii. Lectures. Lectures have been given regularly in the House, including one by Professor Ifor Evans on “ Some permanent values in English Literature,” and one by the Polish Naval Attache on the “ Polish Navy.” An interesting innovation in July took the form of the reproduction of a literary and artistic “ Evening in Old Warsaw ” ; an informal entertainment was given by Polish artists, Polish national dishes were served and the experiment proved exceptionally successful. Lessons in English and Polish have continued in the House throughout the quarter, and dances, largely attended by members of the Polish forces, Volontaires Fran 9 ais and A.T.S. have been held regularly once a month. Members of the U.S. forces have also attended these dances and arrangements have been made to admit U.S. citizens of Polish extraction serving in the U.S. forces to the Hearth in future at a nominal subscription rate of 2s. 6d. The premises have also been lent on more than one occasion to the London Branch of the Scottish-Polish Society. b. CZECHOSLOVAK INSTITUTE i. Lectures. Lectures have been given by : Col. Sazavsky (in Czech), Dr. Jiri Weis, Dr. A. Sommerfelt (Head of the Norwegian Department of Education), M. Jan Masaryk, Mr. Philip Guedalla. ii. Exhibitions.

It comprised two sets of Callot’s “ Miseres de la Guerre,” the large and the mall ; the famous prints of Goya’s “ Los desastres de Ui\juerra,” lent by Major Stirling of Keir ; Daumier’s lithographs of the Franco-Prussian war, and a series of anti-Nazi drawings entitled “ Civilisation,” by Geza Szobel, a member of the Czechoslovak forces in Great Britain. A panel-painting, “ Lidice,” was done by Szobel especially for this exhibition. (2) A small private exhibition of work by the Czecho slovak artist, Hannah Gabert, was opened by Minister Juraj Slavik on September 21st, and remained open until October 10th. iii. Concerts. The Institute autumn programme opened with a particularly successful concert given by the Polish Army Choir. This was also an occasion for welcoming visitors from the Polish Hearth, to whom the Institute gave hospitality for the month of September. The membership of the Music Club has increased during the past quarter, and the weekly concerts have been well attended. The usual monthly talks on English music, illustrated by gramophone records, have been given. iv. Dances. On July 25th a very successful dance was held in celebration of” Anna Day,” with the Czecho slovak Army Band. During September, afternoon Inter- Allied tea dances were held and were attended by many Poles and Belgians, as well as the usual British and Czechoslovak visitors. x. Bridge Evenings. Bridge evenings were held weekly. vi. Other Events. Meetings have been held by Czecho slovak Women in Great Britain, Czechoslovak Legion aries, Anglo-Catholic Committee, Czechoslovak Press Association, Study Groups, Youth Groups, International Assembly, Czechoslovak Economic Advisory Associa tion—Minister Necas and a special series on Finance, given mostly by Finance Ministers of Allied countries— “ War Effort Association,” Czechoslovak Journalists Syndicate, Pen Club—regular fortnightly meetings— week-end Conference arranged by the Czechoslovak Foreign Office for collaborators all over England, St. Wenceslas celebration. New Europe Circle meeting, etc. vii. Classes. All English classes have been re organized for the winter, and a number of new students enrolled. Afternoon and evening courses have been formed, and a special class to prepare students for the Cambridge Proficiency Certificate. There are also weekly informal literary lectures. Fortnightly social evenings for English conversation are now an established part of the programme. Classes in the Czech and Russian languages and in English and Czech shorthand have continued to be well attended. viii. Youth Group. The Youth Group meets regularly on Wednesday evenings usually in the library of the Institute. The meetings are varied, some devoted to discussion or lectures, some to concerts of gramophone music. The committee of young people is half English and half Czechoslovak. C. BELGIAN INSTITUTE There are now over 1,300 members, of whom about 920 are Ordinary members and 21 Student members. The Executive Committee agreed that special temporary membership should be made available, at a nominal charge, to members of the Belgian services (including the Mercantile- Marine) on short leave in London. A number of men have already availed themselves of this facility. The autumn programme includes an exhibition of Contemporary Belgian Art, a series of talks on Belgian and English literature by Professor Cammaerts and Mr. Michael Roberts ; Mr. Ashley Dukes is inaugurating a series of talks on The English Theatre. For younger members, informal afternoon tea-dances on alternate Saturdays, seem to be greatly appreciated. A Members’ dinner was held on September 25th, with a view to bringing Belgian and British members together. At the request of the Belgian Colonial Office classes have been held for young men proceeding to the Congo. d. THE YUGOSLAV HOUSE The House was formally opened by H.M. King Peter of Yugoslavia on September 24th ; the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Yugoslav Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke and the Chairman of the British Council presided. The House had been unofficially open since May 12th. Membership is very satisfactory, when it is remembered how few Yugoslav subjects are in Great Britain, and now exceeds 200. A special temporary membership has been created for Yugoslavs serving with the Allied forces and has been very well received. English and Serbo- Croat lessons are now being given at the House and attendance is very satisfactory. A considerable number of successful functions have been held including two receptions at which leading Yugoslav ladies acted as hostesses. e. BRITISH-NORWEGIAN INSTITUTE This Institute was opened by H.R.H. Crown Prince Olav of Norway on September 1st, the eve of Norwegian University Day. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Foreign Secretary of the Norwegian Government also spoke. The Chairman of the British Council presided. The House was generously placed at the disposal of the Institute by Madame Carlier. It is clear that this Institute has met a need, as member ship is rapidly increasing ; a special temporary member ship at a nominal charge has been created for members of the Norwegian forces and Mercantile Marine. The restaurant has been overcrowded and will probably need to be extended. A Norwegian Junior School is at present housed in the Institute and the Norwegian Youth Association, as well as other Norwegian Societies, are using the building for regular meetings and functions. /. GREEK HOUSE The Advisory Committee of the Greek House have now obtained premises at 32 Grosvenor Square. The Committee are indebted to the Hon. Clive Pearson who has very kindly placed these premises at their dis posal on the most generous terms. g. INSTITUT FRANCAIS During the past three months, especially since the appointment of Mr. Edward Knoblock as public re lations officer, the Institut Fra^ais has greatly increased10 . its activities. In the cours publics section a series ot matinees has been arranged in collaboration with the Allied Governments ; the programmes have included concerts of music, plays and a performance by the Belgian Company of Marionettes. In the term now beginning, an impressive programme of public lectures will be given by distinguished English men and Frenchmen, including high officers of the Fight ing French, together with film shows, musical concerts and dramatic performances—the latter under the direc tion of M. Boniface of the Comedie Fran^aise and Mr. Edward Stirling, Director of the English Theatre of Paris, 1924-1940. The increased public interest in the activities of the Institut Fran^ais is a source of gratification, and con gratulations are due to the responsible officials of the Institut. h. CYPRUS ASSOCIATION The Cyprus Association has pursued its activities on an increased scale. The number of fully paid up mem bers has increased, as has the general attendance at film shows and other functions of a cultural nature. An attempt is being made to organize a fuller programme of lectures, concerts and evening parties. /'. SCOTTISH-POLISH HOUSE Madame Nicolle has been appointed organizing secre tary for the Scottish-Polish House. Lectures have been given by Lt. Buzzard (“ My first Journey in Poland ”) ; Marcel Henri Jaspar (“ William Pitt et la permanence de la politique anglaise ”) ; Capt. V. Swicz (“ How I came to write a book in English ”) ; William Beattie (“ A Polish King of Madagascar ”) ; Dr. John Oliver (“ Ramsay to Fergusson ’’—first of three lectures on 18th century Edinburgh) ; Lt. Izycki (“ Polish Cities and their Life ”) ; Dr. C. A. Malcolm (“ Fergusson to Burns ”—18th century Edinburgh 2). The demand for English lessons has necessitated the employment of an additional teacher, Miss Taylor. The number studying Polish has also greatly increased. /'. SCOTTISH-CZECHOSLOVAK HOUSE Miss Leslie Goddard has now become full-time secre tary of the Scottish-Czechoslovak House. During the past quarter, the following lectures have been given :—Dr. Lumir Soukup (“ Anniversary of Zborow ”) ; Professor Burlight (Lecture on Jan Hus) ; Mrs. Sargent (“ Education in Czechoslovakia ”) ; Dr. C.

On July 26th the Scottish Military Pipe Band of the 1st Lowland Division gave a very successful concert at the Club. m. ALLIED CENTRE, LIVERPOOL Two further floors have now been added to the Allied Centre, one of which forms the American Rooms of the Centre. At the request of the Air Ministry arrangements have been made by which groups of Dominion airmen are received at the Centre immediately they arrive in the United Kingdom. This puts a great additional strain on the staff but is deeply appreciated by the Air Ministry and the pilots who are thus entertained. Usually only two or three hours’ notice can be given of their arrival. On July 4th the High Commissioner for India was received at the Centre and on the same day, an American Independence Day dance was arranged for members of the U.S. Army Air Force and U.S. citizens of Merseyside. The Lord Mayor and Lord and Lady Leverhulme received the guests.

O. PROVINCIAL CENTRES AND CLUBS FOR ALLIED SEAMEN The Council has provided educational programmes for other centres in Sheffield, Nottingham, Glasgow, and Cardiff. At Birmingham, for example, English classes are organized twice a week. The Council pro vides one lecture on cultural topics and once a month organizes an open forum. Numerous Centres established for Allied and Neutral merchant seamen continue to receive assistance, the Council’s officers in Newcastle having given consider able help to a new Dutch Club established in Newcastle.Dominion, American and Allied European Forces a. ALLIED EUROPEAN BRIGADES In Edinburgh the courses arranged in co-operation with the War Office at the Polish Military Bureau have continued. Besides lectures, intensive courses of in struction in the English language were given. The Council has arranged 26 lectures at this course in the past quarter, covering every aspect of Scottish life. The Polish Government has requested the Council’s assistance in providing a special course in English, and lectures on administration for 250 Polish officers released from the army to be prepared for administrative work in Poland. As an experiment, a “ forum ” was arranged for the Czechoslovak army which proved a great success and is to be repeated. The students of a University in the neighbourhood of the Netherlands Brigade have generously made arrange ments for an Anglo-Netherlands Club to be established in the premises of the Guild of Undergraduates. The Council is assisting Belgian University students in the Belgian Brigade to continue their studies. The provision of books, periodicals and film shows has continued in all Brigades and officers and men from various Allied units were enabled to attend a special course for Dominion and Allied service men at the University of Oxford. b. ALLIED AIR FORCES The Council’s Regional Officers and their assistants Ijave kept in close touch with Allied units of the R.A.F. have given much assistance with leave periods and in the provision of literature. In Liverpool a reception was held for officers of the Dominion and Allied Air Forces and Women’s Auxiliary Air Force, and the Lord Mayor of Liverpool welcomed the visitors on behalf of the City of Liverpool. C. ALLIED NAVIES A teacher of English has been appointed for the Polish Navy and in the Glasgow area a special teacher has been attached to the Council staff who spends much of his time teaching English to Polish, Fighting French and Norwegian naval personnel. d. U.S.A. FORCES The Council is working in collaboration with the Min istry of Information on the problem of the reception of U.S.A. personnel during leave and off-duty hours. A considerable number of activities have been arranged for U.S.A. personnel, particularly in Liverpool where American rooms have now been added to the Allied Centre. Details are given under “ National Centres.” The Council is conferring with the Directorate of Education at the War Office with regard to the provision of facilities, through the British Council, to U.S.A. forces when on service with their units. A number of film shows of Council films have already been provided for y^ierican units and books on various aspects of Britain and professional journals have been provided. The Ministry of Information has requested the Council to be responsible for the provision of guide books for towns which are likely to be visited by the American forces on leave. A special officer is to be appointed to undertake this task. e. U.S.A. MERCHANT SEAMEN A special officer has been sent from America to look after the interests of U.S.A. merchant seamen and is working in close touch with the British Council, Ministry of War Transport and Ministry of Labour. 11 and arranging for discussions and exchange of views; 23 such visits have been arranged recently. It is inter esting to note that as a result some of the Canadians wished to spend their leave working on farms and this was arranged through the Council’s officers. By special request a visit to Arundel Castle was arranged for one unit and further visits to places of historic interest are being undertaken. A number of units are now showing programmes of British documentary films and the provision of the weekly newsreel by British Movietone News continues. Books for English classes, French-commentated films, French gramophone records and lecture,s in French are all being provided for French Canadian units. The Council has been responsible for the payment of two-thirds of fees of other ranks of the Canadian Army attending a special course at Oxford for Dominion, American and Allied Forces ; 330 men have been enabled to attend the course. £. R.A.A.F. AND R.C.A.F. The Council has been asked to discuss with the officers commanding R.A.A.F. and R.C.A.F. squadrons the facilities which might be appreciated by Australian and Canadian airmen. Technicians a. INDIAN TECHNICIANS Members of the fifth group of Indian trainees to visit this country were entertained by the Council on Septem ber 10th. Mr. Graham White, M.P., arranged a visit to the House of Commons and afterwards the trainees were entertained to a lunch at the Holborn Restaurant. Assistance was given in arranging a tour for the High Commissioner for India to Liverpool and Manchester to enable him to study the facilities for Indian seamen. In Manchester trainees from India have been enter tained by the Lord Mayor, were taken to see places of historic interest, and by special request attended plays by Shakespeare. b. NEWFOUNDLAND LOGGERS Sir Angus Gillan, Director of the Council’s Empire Division, and Mr. Ross, the Council’s Officer for the West of Scotland, made a tour of some of the New foundland Logger Camps in August. The Newfound land men deeply appreciated the facilities provided by the Council, and the Dominions Office and the Ministry of Supply have expressed their appreciation of the Council’s assistance in this field. C. BRITISH HONDURAS TECHNICIANS Sir Angus Gillan and Mr. Ross have also visited units of the British Honduras camps to see if the Council can assist these technicians. The Council’s officers in Manchester have arranged entertainment for men from British Honduras stationed in that area and on September 10th arranged a special social evening with a film show, including a film on British Honduras, to celebrate the anniversary of the foundation of the Colony. d. A group of West African munition workers were entertained to luncheon by the Council when they made a visit to London. In Cardiff the work continues in the new Islamic Centre, and on August 28th the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress received Sheikh Abdul Hamid and Sirdar Ikbal Ali Shah. A tea party for the Moslem children in Cardiff area was arranged on the same day. /. CANADIAN ARMY An officer of the Council has now been attached full time to the Canadian Army, and in addition Mr. Douglas Le Pan, a member of General MacNaughton’s staff, devotes part of his time to the Council’s work. Technical visits, in particular to the farms in the neighbourhood of units, proved most successful, the estate and farm owners providing a hospitable welcome Prisoners of War At the request of the authorities concerned with Italian prisoners of war, the Council has agreed to under take the teaching of English to selected prisoners. Gibraltarians During the past quarter excursions have been arranged at 16 Gibraltarian Centres, lectures on London at eight■w 1A 12 Centres, regular classes and community singing at six Centres and speech training at two Centres, in addition to the supply of films and literature. All Gibraltarian teachers were enabled to see a per formance of “ Macbeth.” National Days and Special Celebrations During the past quarter the Council’s officers through out the United Kingdom have given considerable help in ensuring that the National Days of Belgium, Holland, Norway, the American Independence Day and Quatorze Juillet have been suitably commemorated. The distribution of books in the United Kingdom has included presentations to the American Army and to new centres for Chinese and Indian seamen. Popular libraries are being built up in Newfoundland Forestry Units in isolated parts of Scotland, and a number of specialized books, experimentally included in these, have led to requests from the men for further information on the same subjects. Several thousands of books in the languages of the United Nations have been distributed amongst the forces serving in this country, in addition to presentations made to Allied Centres. IV FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES a. Books and Periodicals BOOK PRESENTATIONS The demand for British books in Turkey has been stimulated by the establishment of lending libraries in Istanbul, Smyrna and Ankara and every effort is being made to meet it, especially in medicine, engineering and general science. A thousand books are being sent from England for this purpose alone, with at least two thousand from Egypt, and in addition large numbers of books have been and are being sent to universities, schools and priv ate individuals, as part of routine activities in Turkey. The Council has undertaken to establish an English Section in every Halkevi library throughout Turkey, beginning with the fifty largest, and lists have been sent to Ankara for approval. A fire which unfortunately destroyed most of the library of the Faculty of Science in the University of Istanbul gave the Council the opportunity to assist in its re-establishment; large collections of books on physics, geology, mathematics and metallurgy (chosen by English experts) have been sent, and further requests will be met. In the Soviet Union, exchange relations have been established or re-established between the Lenin Library and various academic and scientific institutions in England. Presentations of British books are being made wherever interest in them is expressed. Shortage of books is a serious handicap here as elsewhere ; the best books are increasingly difficult to obtain, and all too often it is the second best which has to be sent. The University of La Paz in Bolivia asked for a special collection of books on economics and political science and these have been ordered. The University of Chile, celebrating its first centenary on November 19th, has been sent a large library of English books. Work in the other South American countries grows in volume with each quarter and, here again, the shortage of books is the one depressing factor. Spain, Portugal and Sweden are always given careful attention and Professor Cairns’ visit to the Iberian Peninsular aroused considerable interest in the special branches of medicine in which he has done so much. With his expert advice, British books on neurology, neuro-surgery, and other medical subjects were pre sented to various institutes and individuals. In the Middle East, textbooks have been supplied in sufficient quantities to ensure the continuation of the work of the schools. The War Office has obtained financial authority for the Council to send books and periodicals to the Allied forces in the Middle East. Work in the Empire has not gone far beyond the stage of careful planning, although much has already been done to supply the individual needs of such schools and institutions as have been brought specially to the Coun cil’s notice. Mr. F. D. Gray took with him to the British West Indies the beginnings of a good reference library, and a collection of characteristic textbooks and children’s books. In Africa, arrangements have been made to send Mr. Malcolm Guthrie collections of books for each of the areas which he visits, made on his advice to meet particular local requirements. Libraries have been made for the units of the Royal Canadian Air Force in the U.K. and every effort is being made to meet the demand for French books for the French Canadians in the Canadian forces. PUBLICATIONS Eighteen months ago the Council was responsible for eleven brochures in English : it now has in various stages of production rather more than eighty volumes in English Czech, Dutch, French, Greek, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. It is preparing five series (three of which will each contain twenty titles by next Spring) as well as separate volumes of considerable importance. BOOK LISTS Revision of the important Book List on British Civilization and Institutions has been completed. PERIODICALS Further progress has been made in overcoming delays in transit to the Middle East, the dispatch of eighty packing cases of periodicals to Egypt and thirty-five to Turkey during the quarter, under the most favouradC conditions at present available, being a good augury for the future of this work in the Middle East. The Representative in Turkey writes from Ankara : “ Our distribution of the periodicals that you are sending me is playing a vital part in our activities and may well be doing more than anything else to gain us friends among the leading members of the Turkish State and Society.” Dispatches to Sweden and China continue. It is satisfactory to report that the Council’s special channels of communication with Spain, Sweden and Turkey are being used extensively by scientific societies and univers ities in those countries for resuming the supply of their journals to English colleagues, from whom many letters of appreciation have been received. An increasing number of requests have been received from these foreign societies for assistance in obtaining scientific and technical publications against payment, particularly in respect of back numbers. Many of these have arisen from the initial supply by the Council of specimen copies. Under the new arrangements with the War Office for the Allied Forces in the Middle East a number of general and specialized periodicals have already been sent for distribution from Cairo. b. Export of Publications BOOK EXPORT SCHEME Orders to the value of £6,617 were placed during this quarter. Through the agency of Mr. Scully, the book representative sent to South America by Simpkin Marshall (1941) Ltd., acting for the Council and the Publishers Association, substantial orders have been received from nine new bookshops in Uruguay and one in Argen tina. During the past quarter Syria has been included in the Book Export School. TURKISH BOOK SUBSIDY Orders to the value of £755 have been placed during these three months. Bookshops in Smyrna are now operating under the scheme besides those in Ankara and Istanbul. BOOKS FOR RESALE The arrangements made earlier in the year whereby the Representative in Turkey distributes books to Turkishbooksellers for sale in their shops are being carried into effect, and to date books to the value of £1,500 have been purchased for this purpose. BOOK EXHIBITION It is expected that the exhibition in Iceland will open in October. BOOK TRANSLATIONS The Council continues to assist authors, publishers and literary agents in Britain and abroad who are negotiating translation rights. Most requests for reading copies, etc., of recent publications have come, as usual, from Sweden, but there has been a considerable increase in the number of enquiries from Spain and Portugal ; they have mostly been concerned with the work of estab lished British writers of the present century. Interest in translation of scientific and medical books is being shown in South America. BOOK REVIEWS The Book Review Scheme has been extended in the following directions :— The arrangements for broadcasts reviews in Portugal are proceeding and books which are reviewed in this way are exposed for sale in a Lisbon bookshop at the time of broadcast. Written reviews of the same books are printed in the Anglo-Portuguese News after the broadcast. Four books a month are being sent to the Belgian C^ongo for broadcast review and the number sent to walestine has been increased at the request of the broad casting authorities. Specially written articles on books are supplied by arrangement with the B.B.C. for broad casting to Syria in English and Arabic. The number of books sent for review in the press of Portugal, Spain, Argentina and Brazil have been in creased pursuant to requests received. Books are being sent for review through the agency of the Writers Union of the U.S.S.R., in small monthly consignments including medical and scientific books and works of general literary interest, each accompanied by a short synopsis. Books on agriculture, forestry and soil science, accompanied by an expert review will be sent as they become available. c. Britain To-day The Spanish edition of “ Britain To-day ” is now printed (from moulds sent out by the English printers) in two centres—at Buenos Aires and Panama. From the former copies are distributed to Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. All the other countries of Spanish America are supplied from Panama. The new arrange ment facilitates quicker and surer distribution. Copies in Portuguese for circulation in Brazil are printed in Rio de Janeiro. It was announced in the last Quarterly Report that a beginning had been made with the experiment of selling copies in the United States at a subscription price of 1 dollar 25 cents a year. The number of subscriptions which was 1,800 in June, was 2,956 on September 23rd. Enemy propagandists have paid a compliment to the influence of “Britain To-day” (A Gra-Bretanha de Hoje) in Portugal by producing and circulating what purports to be a copy of the journal, with a similar format, and an exact representation of the cover design. The articles are depreciatory of Britain and British activities. The fraud has been exposed in the Portuguese press and in a broadcast talk. d. Drama Several British plays of which the texts have been sent out by the Council have been accepted for trans lation and production by Swedish theatres during the coming winter. Discussion took place with Mr. Kaj Bonnier, the Swedish publisher, during his recent visit to England as the Council’s guest, on the possibilities of the further extension of the Council’s dramatic activities in Sweden. The central agency for the marketing of British plays in Ibero-America has begun to operate and has already disposed of some plays. Mr. Larus Palsson, the manager and producer of the leading theatrical company in Iceland, arrived in England in October. Twenty-eight British Institutes and Anglophil Societies have become corporate members of the British Drama League. British plays for reading and acting continue to reach play-reading societies in Europe, the Middle East and Ibero-America. e. Films A number of the films in the series intended for class room use abroad have been viewed and approved by the Board of Education, and H.M. Inspectors, who expressed a wish that the films might be distributed in English schools. The Board have offered to advise on the production of future classroom films. A showing of films was arranged for Professor Niels Dungals, Principal of the University of Reykjavik while on a visit here from Iceland. He asked that copies of Council films might be supplied regularly for exhibitions in the recently-established University Cinema. The British Colour Council saw a number of the Council’s colour films on cotton, Harris tweed, Scottish tweeds, pottery, etc. NEW PRODUCTION 1. Newsreels. British News (the Council’s composite British newsreel) has been distributed each week to 30 British Colonies with the co-operation of the Colonial Office and the Ministry of Information.

DISTRIBUTION During the quarter 403 prints of Council films includ ing duplicate negatives for reproduction of copies were despatched to 62 territories. Commentaries were re corded in English and eight foreign languages. The demand for films is steadily increasing. THEATRICAL 109 prints were despatched for commercial distribution in 52 territories. Arrangements have recently been made for the improved and wider distribution of the Council’s films in public cinemas in Australia, Sweden and Switzer land. NON-THEATRICAL 294 prints have been sent to educational authorities and other institutions in 35 territories, of which 62 were sent to British Institutes and Anglophile Societies, REPORTS The following are extracts from some of the reports received during the last quarter :—Bermuda. A selection of films have been sent to the English Speaking Union. “ They were exhibited in the open air and were very much appreciated. So much so that we have had quite a number asking whether we will be able to give another show and when . . Canada. A preliminary report shows 172 screenings to over 12,000 pieople during May, June and July. One of the Council’s films “ John Bull ” has been seen by more than 97,000 people since June. Egypt. The last report received from the Cairo Office showed that during August 92 copies of 16 mm. films were distributed by the Film Officer between 12 educa tional institutions in Egypt, Turkey, Belgian Congo, Sudan, Palestine and Syria. Malta. Mr. Wickham stated :— “ The Institute cinema was for some time the only one open in Valletta and has been able to help in mitigating the routine of life in Malta in new ways . . . Films have been lent to the Information Office for a series of shows to farmers and the projector and films have been lent to the Welfare Officer of the R.A.F.” Palestine. A private show of the Council films was given at Government House during March, to an audience which included the King of Greece and the High Com missioner. “ It would appear to have been a great success and much appreciated.” Peru. The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of the Interior have helped in arranging shows of Council films. Shows have been given to workmen’s institutions, schools, and various intellectual societies. Portugal. “Queen Cotton” was shown to 13,500 people in seven cinemas and was declared to be “ a great success in all the cinemas where it was shown. It is considered a masterpiece.” “ Green Girdle ” was shown to 26,900 people in 24 cinemas. f. Fine Arts children’s exhibitions These three exhibitions, of 200 drawings each, are still on tour. The collections have been shown in the following centres :— In Canada at Ottawa, Montreal, St. John, New Brunswick and Toronto. In the U.S.A. at Savannah ; Columbus, Georgia ; Collegeboro, Georgia ; Athens, Georgia ; West Palm Beach, Florida ; Jacksonville ; Gaines ville, Florida ; Tampa, Florida ; Charleston, South Carolina ; Los Angeles ; Seattle ; New Orleans ; Birmingham, Alabama. Owing to the large size of the exhibit, it was decided to select fifty-one drawings of varying types for display by the Modern Museum of Art, New York. The authorities later exhibited these at the following centres :— New York ; Dover, Delaware ; Toledo ; Phoenixville, Pennsylvania ; Utica, New York ; Chicago ; Minneapolis ; Oberlin, Ohio. In South America. Brazil, at Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre. The collection is to visit Curitiba before going to Montevideo. EXHIBITION OF BRITISH CRAFTS IN U.S.A. In the Metropolitan Museum in New York, 400 visitors expressed a desire to purchase exhibits from the collection. Mr. Blake-More Godwin, Director of the Toledo Museum of Art, wrote :— “ We were delighted with the exhibition in every way. I am sure it is going to have a most successful tour in this country. The choice of material is splendid. . . . The assemblage sent over for this exhibition confirms more than ever the opinion which we formed when in England in 1939. The wide range of materials and techniques gives great variety and interest to the exhibition. Also the excellent selection of material allows great flexibility in the installation of the exhibition, which makes it particularly suitable for the varying requirements of museums in the United States.” Mr. Allen Eaton, Director of the Russell Sage Founda tion, wrote on June 25th :— “ The character and quality of the exhibition are such that it brings us a most welcome and inspiring message. I rejoice that it includes in its scope representative objects ranging from work in the rural regions to the best examples of arts and crafts done in the cities. “At this writing, 17,750 have visited the exhibition at the Metropolitan. “ These human communications will receive an extraordinary welcome because of the circumstances which hold all England now. Perhaps it should not be, but, nevertheless, it is a very great surprise that you should send us, in these days, such extra ordinary evidence of British taste and skill and democratic culture. I am trying to believe that under similar circumstances we might have done a similar thing. There can be no way of knowing this, but in any case it is certain that nothing could have been so helpful to what we are calling the American handicraft movement as this British Exhibition, under these unparalleled circumstances. It answers with an overwhelming affirmative the question which many of us have been asking, ‘ Should we keep on in our vital work in the handicrafts ? ’ Countless Americans will long be grateful to you for this fine encourage ment to a common cause.” The exhibition is now on show at Worcester for five weeks, then it proceeds to Toledo, Ohio, in November ; afterwards it will be presented at Kansas City and later at St. Louis. Thence it proceeds to Canada to be shown at three or more cities, after which it will return to complete the tour in the U.S.A. A report on the exhibition at Worcester, states :— “ The Director of the Museum told me that he thought your exhibit much more valuable than any more direct form of propaganda, and stressed what he thought to be the morale raising quality of keeping the arts in view during war-time, especially in a manufacturing town such as Worcester, where war industry is going strong. He felt your exhibit, and othe« such activities, a valuable form of relaxation.” ^ EXHIBITION OF MODERN PAINTINGS FOR THE U.S.A. The first part of this collection, selected from the Coun cil’s exhibit in the Government Pavilion at the New York World’s Fair, was shown in the galleries at St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and Cleveland. On account of the numerous requests for a Modern British Exhibition, the Council decided to bring this collection up to date by the addition of certain more recently painted pictures ; consequently forty-five works were sent out from this country, arrived safely and are to be shown with the above collection at Indianapolis in October, and Toledo in November and December, after which the collection will visit Yale University ; Smith College, Northampton ; The New York Art Institute ; and the Mont Clair, New Jersey, Museum ; later it will be sent to the Pacific coast. EXHIBITION OF GRAPHIC ART IN BUENOS AIRES, ETC. This collection of prints has now been successfully shown in Buenos Aires, Rosario, Montevideo, Rio de Janeiro and Cordoba. It is interestingjto note that no less than 182 prints, valued at £945 2s. 6d., have been sold. A despatch from H.M. Ambassador read :— “ The exhibition of English engravings now on show is having an excellent and well-deserved success—increased considerably by the fact that these works safely crossed the ocean in spite of German threats and menaces to our shipping.” ^ m. The Council’s representative in Brazil, Mr. E. E. Church, wrote regarding the Exhibition of British En gravings at the Museu Nacional de Bellas Artes :— “ I am very glad that it was possible for it to come here, for it created a very good impression, and it was important, I think, to follow up the success of the Children's Drawings show with just such a demonstration of pure British craftsmanship and technique as this. The exhibition was seen by many thousands of visitors, and although it did not provide such obvious material for the columnists and art amateurs as the children’s show, it received very good notices, and has been the outstanding event of the Bellas Artes season so far.” It is expected that the exhibit will visit Santiago, Concepcion, Valparaiso, La Paz and Lima. EXHIBITION OF GRAPHIC ART IN MADRID Professor Starkie, in spite of anti-British propaganda, was able to assemble a remarkable collection of dis tinguished visitors at the Private View, including eleven Ambassadors and Ministers. Madrid Society visited the show in large numbers and no less than ninety-five works, to the value of £341 6s. Od. were sold. The remainder of the collection has been sent on to Lisbon for an exhibition in December.the WAKEFIELD COLLECTION Two water-colours by Wilson Steer and one each by William Roberts, D. I. Smart, R. T. Cowern and P. H. Jowett have been purchased. MIRANDA HOUSE In connection with the unveiling of the plaque on Miranda House, where Miranda resided in London from 1803 to 1810, engravings of Miranda, Bolivar and four of his English associates were framed and placed on the walls as a permanent memorial to his welcome in this country. A similar set of engravings has been sent to the Venezuelan-British Cultural Institute in Caracas. ALLIED ART EXHIBITION The Allied Art Exhibition, after being shown in Belfast, continued its tour of Northern Ireland and had a success ful run at Portadown, Bangor and Ballymena. Parties of school-children were taken round and specially arranged lectures were given. g. Lectures The reports which have now come in of the lecture tour of Spain and Portugal recently undertaken for the Council by Professor Cairns, Nuffield Professor of Surgery at Oxford University, indicate that it was a complete success. Professor Cairns’ lectures were attended by the heads of the Spanish and Portuguese edical faculties and other learned bodies and his re- ption was everywhere one of extreme cordiality. His own report on his return has indicated a wide field for cultural exchange between the scientists of this country and of the Iberian Peninsula. The Council is acting on Professor Cairns’ recommendations, and it is hoped to arrange for visits to be made in the near fliture by repre sentative British scientists to Spain and Portugal and vice versa. Arrangements are complete for a lecture tour of Sweden by Mr. W. G. Holford, A.R.I.B.A., Professor of Civic Design in the University of Liverpool and at present Assistant Secretary in the Ministry of Works and Planning. Professor Holford will lecture on techni cal and general aspects of modern British architecture, with special emphasis on reconstruction and post-war planning.

Legation in Bolivia, and to the Representative in Stockholm. Complete recordings of folk dances with instruction books to the Professor of Music at Tucuman University, Argentina. c. Talks. Talks on various aspects of British music illustrated by gramophone records have been despatched to Brazil and the British West Indies. GENERAL The Council has recently received from the U.S.S.R. a presentation of scores of musical works by leading Soviet composers. British composers have replied to the letter from Soviet composers mentioned in the last report. Their letter was signed in the presence of Madame Maisky, to whom was formally presented. ^ At the request of the Director of the British Institute in Madrid, the Council selected books and other material on the teaching of music, for presentation in Madrid to Father Otano, who has been charged by the Spanish Government with the task of re-organizing musical education in Spain, and expressed a desire to do this on English lines. With the books and music were also sent gramophone records, to be used in connection with the books and music. A letter of appreciation and thanks has been received from Father Otano. Miss Kathleen Long is now in Iceland where she will give recitals and concerts for the Reykjavik Music Society as well as broadcasts to the troops. SHEET MUSIC a. Orchestral. Scores and parts of orchestral works have been sent Jo Buenos Aires for National Conser vatoires, Cairo for the English School, to the British Legation, San Salvador for an all-English concert by the Symphony Orchestra of the Republic, and to Sweden for the Gotenborgs Orkesterforening. A further supply of scores has been sent to Malta. i. Medicine 1. MEDICAL ABSTRACTS The number of condensed versions of British medical articles prepared by the British Medical Information Service now exceeds 800 and further abstracts are pre pared at the rate of 30 per month. The total number of publications recorded to date in all languages con siderably exceeds 2,000 without making allowance for the time-lag between distribution of material and notifi cation of its publication. It is estimated that each item distributed is published in four to five medical journals and with the extension of the service in the Portuguese and English languages this ratio will become higher. a. Spain and Spanish America. The abstracts in Spanish continue to be used by the majority of medical journals in the Spanish language (excluding Transac tions of Medical Societies and similar periodicals which never publish extraneous matter). The latest return of items published in Spanish was 2,082. Several further requests have been received from Latin-American Government Departments who wish to receive and file the abstracts. b. Portugal and Brazil. The first returns from the Portuguese-language editions are being received from Portugal and Brazil and the early responses are very satisfactory. One of the abstracts, which described a technique of preparing dried blood-serum for transfusion was responsible for an enquiry from a Portuguesedoctor who wished for further information on the apparatus used and information whereby his own technique might be improved. The information was obtained from the Medical Research Council’s Serum Drying Unit and forwarded to Portugal. The Director of the British Institute in Portugal at Lisbon has learnt that a number of the abstracts are to be used in a special number of a Portuguese journal devoted to British Medicine (see also under “ Articles ”). The total number of publications so far notified is 48. c. Other Territories. An English edition of the abstracts is distributed to the Dominions, India, and to countries for which it is not practicable to prepare material in the appropriate languages. A good response has been obtained from the two leading Canadian medical journals, and two well-known Indian journals are making extensive use of the abstracts. Undertakings to publish in translation have been received from Sweden and Switzerland, in each case from the principal medical journal. The total number of publications so far notified as a result of the English edition is 135. 2. ARTICLES Further original articles from British medical experts have been published in the foreign medical press. Some months after the publication of one such article in a Mexican specialist journal, a letter was received from the editor saying how greatly the article had been appreciated in Mexico and asking that this appreciation should be conveyed to the author. Fifty off-prints of the article were sent with this letter. Another article by a prominent British bacteriologist has resulted in a request for a culture from a medical scientist in South America. An article on the British Blood Transfusion Services has been commissioned and sent for publication in the special number of the Portuguese journal mentioned above. An article has been obtained from a leading South American expert on Nutrition and will shortly be pub lished in a British medical periodical. An article on the organization of Blood Transfusion Services has been obtained from the U.S.S.R. for publication in this country. 3. EXCHANGES OF JOURNALS Further exchanges between British and Overseas medical journals have been arranged. 4. MEDICAL BOOK REVIEWS A scheme for medical book reviews has been elabor ated. A classified list has been drawn up of overseas medical journals with which contacts have already been established through the medical abstracts. One out standing British medical book is selected at intervals of approximately one month, and where desirable, a special review is commissioned from an appropriate British expert. This review is then duplicated in Spanish, Portuguese and English and sent with copies of the chosen book to the appropriate journals on the classified list. Reproductions of the review of the first book so distributed have already been received in four Spanish language medical periodicals. 5. MEDICAL FILMS A Medical Film Sub-Committee has been appointed and four meetings have been held. A preliminary pro gramme of four films has been decided upon and the composition of one of these films has been discussed in detail. The films are intended primarily for exhibition to overseas medical audiences and in each case the collaboration of appropriate British medical specialists is being sought. 6. MISCELLANEOUS An increasing number of miscellaneous medical enquiries have been dealt with. A reception to Allied doctors and scientists was held on July 23rd under the joint auspices of the Council and the Royal Society of Medicine. Guests were re ceived by the Chairman of the Science Committee, Lord Snell and the President of the Royal Society of Medicine, who made speeches of welcome. Mme. Maisky attended the reception, representing the Soviet Ambassador. j. Press and Receptions NEW APPOINTMENTS Mr. B. Chinnery Haldane has joined the staff in the Press and Receptions Division, for work on receptions.

PHOTOGRAPHIC UNIT The Council’s Photographic Unit, now working to full capacity with the new dark room, issued during the past quarter 81,372 prints and 49,600 stereos, as illus trations accompanying the London Letter, Facts about Britain, articles and Sports Letters. The photographic dark room, besides producing average of 900 prints a day for the Press Division, has proved of the greatest value to other departments of the Council. The Council’s Photographer, Mr. Harold White, f.b.p., f.r.p.s., was successful in the acceptance of three of the Council’s photographs for the Annual Exhibition of the Royal Photographic Society. VISITS Dr. Manuel V. Tinoco, the Venezuelan Deputy and journalist, arrived in this country on August 5th and spent just over a month here as the guest of the Council. Dr. Tinoco came as the bearer of a letter of greeting to Parliament from both Venezuelan Houses of Parliament, and was received by the Lord Chancellor and by the Speaker. During his visit he made a special study of social services in this country and visited universities and schools. He was also given an opportunity of seeing bomber and fighter stations of the R.A.F., watched war factories in production, met many of the heads of the Allied Governments and generally gained a compre hensive picture of life in Britain to-day. A delegation of Swedish editors, whose departure had been delayed for many weeks, reached this country on September 6th. The members of the delegation were :— a Dr. Ivan Pauli Social Demokruten W ‘ Mr. Erik Wastberg Nya Dagligt Allehanda Mr. Matts Hojer Svenska Dagbladet Mr. K. A. Tunberger Dagens Nyheter Dr. Hjalmar Linder Svenska Morgonbladet Mr. Harald Wigforss Nordens Frihet The delegation was received by Sir Malcolm Robert son and Lord Snell on their arrival, in the presence of the British and overseas press and, at later stages in their visit, by the Foreign Secretary, the Minister of Food, the Minister of Agriculture, and the Minister of Information. They visited the Houses of Parliament (conducted by Mr. John Parker, m.p., and Sir Eugene Ramsden, Bart., m.p.), and were entertained by Lord Riverdale, Vice- Chairman of the Council, the joint General Managers of Reuters, the Norwegian Government, the Polish Government, the Overseas League, the Daily Express and the Foreign Press Association. They visited, among other cities, Oxford, Bath, Bristol, Worcester, Edinburgh and Glasgow. They were shown the bomb damage in Bath and Bristol by the Mayor and Lord Mayor respectively.17 With the co-operation of the War Office they were enabled to see an all-day Battle Programme (carried out with live ammunition) at a Battle School in East Anglia. They visited a Fighter Station and spent the same night at a Bomber Station where they saw Stirlings and Wellingtons take off for the bombing of Frankfurt. They were allowed to be present at the interrogation of the crews on their return. There is little doubt that this was one of the most successful tours ever organized by the Council. One of the members of the delegation, as reported in the Daily Telegraph of September 28th, said : “ I have visited many countries as a journalist but I can say definitely that I have never had so interesting, so valuable or so enjoyable a visit as this.” The party returned to Sweden via Scotland where they were enabled to visit Service Establishments and were entertained by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh. The Swedish publisher, Mr. Kaj Bonnier, visited this country as the guest of the Council, and met leading representatives of British publishing firms, wholesale booksellers and literary agents. Four of the five Turkish journalists visiting Great Britain had previously been the guests of the Council, which advised the Ministry of Information on the arrangements for their highly successful tour here. Mr. Hugh Templin, one of the important Canadian journalists, who visited this country a year ago, has now republished, in pamphlet form, the articles he wrote for tjtf 500 Canadian weekly papers he represented. Apart ^lm the admirable picture of Britain at war which this gives, the articles are enthusiastic in their praise of the Council’s organization during the visit. SPECIAL REQUESTS English short stories are now being regularly supplied to The Anglo-Portuguese News. Of the Allied papers published in Great Britain, the Polish Soldiers’ Daily is now being supplied with a regular series of articles at the special request of the editor, and the Belgian periodical, Message, is publishing a special article on the British Council by the Chairman, and is to publish a series of articles chosen by the Council.

PUBLICITY FOR THE COUNCIL During the quarter twelve full-length articles on the work and aims of the British Council have been published in the national, provincial and periodical press of Great Britain. During this period, the work of the Council has been mentioned in a sum total of 1,300 press cuttings. interesting examples of “ reciprocity ” in the publicity iWd are afforded by the publicity obtained by the Council in the British press for the Turkish Language Congress on August 10th ; by the general articles on Turkish subjects (supplied by Mr. Grant) for which publication has been obtained in The Asiatic Review and elsewhere ; and by the publicity obtained in the national press for a concert at the National Gallery on September 3rd, at which Miss Astra Desmond gave a first recital of the songs of the Spanish composer, Guridi—a valuable example of the reciprocity for the enthusiastic hearing obtained for British works in Spain through the British Institute in Madrid. k. Science (excluding Medicine dealt with under i) MONTHLY SCIENCE NEWS An English edition of Monthly Science News is being printed in Sweden, bringing the total number of editions printed overseas up to six. In view of the reception of the first Brazilian Portuguese editions printed in Rio de Janeiro, the printing order in Brazil is being increased from 2,000 to 5,000. 667 individual requests to be placed on the M.S.N. mailing list were received by the Editor during the last three months. A further number of requests were also sent direct to the publishing offices in the various countries in which M.S.N. is printed. In addition to these requests, 1,000 copies of M.S.N. are being distri buted to the members of the American Association of Scientific Workers. The results of direct contact by correspondence with editors of newspapers in the South American Republics and India, are now being felt, a number of press cuttings having been received during the last month from South American and Indian newspapers ; 66 M.S.N. cuttings were also received from the home press. BROADCASTS Members of the Science Committee have made sug gestions for a new series of twelve overseas broadcasts on British inventions, under the title “ How it Began.” The speakers include Sir Edward Appleton, who is to speak on Sir Oliver Lodge and his contributions to radio physics ; Sir Harold Hartley, who will talk on Murdoch and the invention of gas-lighting, and Sir George Beharrell on Dunlop and the pneumatic tyre. The Council is providing scripts on British scientific activities for broadcasting in Chinese to China. The Council has secured six sets of records of the “ Science Lifts the Veil ” talks for distribution overseas. ANGLO-SOVIET SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION COMMITTEE Twenty-two scientific communications or requests for information have been forwarded to the U.S.S.R. In response to the Committee’s appeal for Russian- English glossaries or dictionaries of scientific terms, thirteen glossaries have been received dealing with :— metallurgy, fuel technology, bacteriology, botany, medicine, military and naval terms, names on maps, and telecommunications. It is proposed to place these glossaries in the Science Library, where they will be available for consultation. A location index of Russian technical dictionaries available in other libraries of scientific institutes and societies is being compiled. A survey of war holdings of Russian periodicals in this country is being undertaken by the Association of Special Libraries and Information Bureaux on the recommendation of the Committee. A panel of trans lators qualified to translate Russian scientific and tech nical material is being formed. “SCIENCE IN BRITAIN' PAMPHLETS Sir Lawrence Bragg has contributed a manuscript on The History of X-Ray Analysis for the “ Science in Britain ” pamphlets.

Students With the collaboration of the Delegacy of Extra- Mural Studies, a vacation course was held at Oxford from July 24th to August 14th. 115 students from 21 countries were present. They included students with scholarships and grants from the Council ; students from Allied countries recommended for the course by their respective Governments ; and Government students from Near Eastern countries. The course was residential and the students lived and studied at Somerville College. At the request of the Turkish Government, the Council arranged a two months’ intensive course in English for 17 of a group of 44 Turkish Naval Engineering students. It was held at the Halkevi in London under the direction of Mr. C. E. Eckersley. Training employment was arranged for other members of the group ; six were accepted by Messrs. Metropolitan-Vickers, two by Messrs. Swan, Hunter &amp; Richardson, two by Messrs. Robey &amp; Co., two by Vickers Armstrong, and two by the English Electric Company. The Council is indebted to the Admiralty, the Professional Engineering Institutions and the Aliens War Service Department for their co operation in this matter. At the end of the vacation the Council was again approached by the Turkish Government for assistance in placing 17 of the same group of students in technical colleges where they could follow diploma courses in Electrical and Marine Engineering, and Naval Archi tecture. Twelve have already been accepted at technical colleges and it is hoped that the remaining five who are students of naval architecture will soon be placed.

Assist ance was given in respect of music and other matters to the Command Fair authorities. There were the customary film shows for members of the Institute and for senior school children. A number of meetings were held in the Institute to discuss “ Reconstruction in Malta.” There was no intrusion of local party politics and members spoke with great freedom. Monsignor Spellman, Archbishop of New York, visited the Institute. Mr. Guedalla inspected much of the Council’s work, including St. Edward’s College and the Institute itself. About 250 senior school children attended a series of lectures on various parts of the British Empire given by serving officers. The number of Maltese members of the Institute now stands at 1,399, the highest figure ever reached. Work on the premises for the new Institute at Gozo continued and should be finished shortly. The Council is much concerned with the work of the Boy Scouts of Malta. H.E. the Governor and Chief Scout for Malta attended a Rally on St. George’s Day of 997 Scouts in uniform and 300 Services personnel—a credit able number after three years of hostilities. The Service Rover Crews are reported to be doing well. Discussions on scouting in general and the Scout Post War Commission attracted large attendances. CYPRUS Professor Ifor Evans visited Cyprus and has since reported on educational and administrative questions. Nicosia Institute. —This Institute maintains member ship at a high level and is developing its facilities in many ways. An attractive Ladies Reading Room has been added. The teaching of English Continued : as classes slackened during the summer, if became possible to spare a member of the English staff, Mr. J. C. Gayford, to teach Rumanian and Bulgarian political refugees at Pedhoulas in the hills. Of 220 refugees there, 110 have enrolled as students. The Institute is increasing its musical activities and its Choral Society has proved successful. Two concerts by the Philharmonic Society were held in the Institute. The Staff again devoted much energy to the promotion of Scouting activities. Lectures and cinema shows were given in the Institute as usual, and the Brains Trust, to which prominent citizens in the Island have given their services, proves a popular feature. The Inter-Institute tennis tournament for the “ British Council Challenge Shield ” was played at the end of May. Famagusta. —Apart from the normal programme, the Institute, at the request of the Military Authorities, arranged English classes for the Cypriot personnel of an army unit recently stationed in the district. Limassol. —The Institute organised a dramatic per formance preceded by a short lecture. It hopes to increase this work to satisfy a strong, local interest in the Theatre. Apart from its normal programme the Institute arranged excursions to places of interest, such as the Bacteriological Laboratory, and visits to other Institutes. Larnaca. —This Institute successfully produced “The Barretts of Wimpole Street.” Other cultural and social activities continued as usual. Kyrenia. —Members of H.M. Services and the Cyprus Volunteer Forces continued to meet at the Institute in a2 friendly atmosphere with the local Cypriots and British communities.

At the invitation of the Military Governor he visited British Somaliland to assess the possibilities of Council activities there. Aden Institute .—The Institute now has a membership of 739. On an average, 100 members attend each evening, and join in discussion meetings, lectures, film shows, musical recitals and readings from Shakespeare’s plays— the latter a successful innovation. English classes for Arabs, Indians and other members, continue ; the classes in colloquial Arabic for European members have achieved much success. The Women’s Branch of the Institute has become an independent organization under the Directorship of Mrs. Madsen. The women members increase in number and show keen interest in English classes and lectures on domestic subjects. PALESTINE Mr. J. H. B. Savage, of Nablus, has taken over the directorship of the British Institute, Jaffa, on Mr. Tucker’s transfer to Turkey in April. Mr. L. G. Thomas has taken Mr. Savage’s place as Director of the Nablus Institute. New premises have been rented for a Notables’ Club and the Director’s house. The British Institute, Haifa, reports 139 students. The library has been much used. By holding lectures in simple language every week, illustrated by epidiascope pictures, an appeal has been made to a large audience. Close contact has been maintained with clubs and schools with the object of attracting young Arabs of a suitable type. A series of four concerts of English chamber music has been held and the Institute has co-operated with the Army Education Officers who have been making use of the reference library. Reports for this quarter from the other British Institutes in Palestine have not yet been received. TRANSJORDAN The King Hussein Club at Amman was opened during the quarter. BRITISH WEST INDIES The appointment of Sir Harry Luke as the Council’s Chief Representative in the British West Indies is causing great interest in all the Islands, and cables of congratula^ tion and welcome have been received. He is studying the Council’s work at Headquarters and will probably leave for the West Indies in August. Mr. Stannard has nearly completed his year’s tour as Cultural Adviser and should arrive in time for consultations in London before Sir Harry Luke’s departure. A scheme for training ten librarians is now proceeding. Scholarships have been approved and candidates are being selected from Barbados, St. Lucia, Antigua, St. Thomas, Grenada, and Tobago.

PA RAGUAY The Centro Anglo-Paraguayo continued to make remarkable progress and now has 1,000 students as against 70 last October. The Director continues to teach the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who asked him to increase the number of hours weekly devoted to the English classes. The Minister of Education also continues to receive private lessons. Among other high officials who are still attending classes are about 20 members of the staff of the Police Headquarters, including the important Jefe de Identificaciones, and high officers of the Admiralty, including the Director General de la Armada. The Centro has organized a large number of extra mural classes, in particular at the Military School, the most important educational establishment in Paraguay, where last year English was included in the curriculum for the first time. The Jefe de Estudios had informed the Director that next year he will be asked to teach all the 200 cadets. Special classes are held for the Workmen’s Academy in Asuncion, for the Naval Academy at Sajonia and the Colegio San Jose, the most important Catholic school in Paraguay. The Centro has been invited to provide English classes for students at the Facultad de Odontologia. Small study groups have been started at a number of places outside the capital. The Centro was invited by the State Radio Station to begin a series of English lessons by radio from 1st April. The broadcasts have become a recognized and popular feature of the programme of the State Radio Station. The Directorate of the Radio Station have suggested that the time devoted to each lesson be doubled, but so far shortage of staff has made this impossible.8 The Director reports a programme of Council films shown at the Teatro Municipal to an audience of some 1,500 people. Sir Eugen Millington-Drake has presented a shield and medals to the Football League. PERU The British-Peruvian Cultural Association at Lima is now established in its new premises—an historic mansion close to the Torre Tagle Palace, which now houses the Peruvian Foreign Ministry. The inaugural ceremony was attended by H.E. Dr. Manuel Prado, President of the Republic, H.M. Minister, Mr. V. C. W. Forbes, and about 600 persons. Dr. Prado has accepted the title of Honorary President of the Association, a noteworthy event, since this is the first occasion on which the head of a foreign state has accepted office in (as opposed to becoming patron of) an Anglophil Society or British Institute. After Mr. Forbes had outlined the objects of the British Council and its activities in Peru, Dr. Prado said : “ As His Majesty’s Minister has just said, the social, political and commercial stability of the peoples depend on the understanding existing between them. . . . Peru, whose policy is one of good understand ing between the countries who love liberty and respect human prerogatives, has also maintained sincere links of friendship with Great Britain which now more than ever before have been tightened by events of history. . . . An expression of that community of ideals and greater understanding between your country and Peru is this important centre, where the people of this capital are enthusiastically welcomed with the object of learning by means of the language and various cultural activities something of the intellectual life of your country.” The Association now has 450 students, as against 215 a year ago, and there are over 100 students awaiting enrolment as soon as additional teachers have been secured.

Other Countries CHINA Nine post-graduate students have arrived from China. They are the first of a large number who have been selected as Council scholars. The rest are expected shortly. This first group, all of high academic standing, consists mainly of graduates in science. The students were entertained by the Council in London together, before they separated to go to the University and otl^p centres where they are to pursue their studies. ~ Professor E. R. Dodds and Dr. Joseph Needham, whose arrival in China was reported in the last Quarterly Report, have been busily engaged in givng lectures and making contacts with the cultural life and work of China. The Council has received from each of them full reports, analysing the opportunities of cultural interchange between China and the United Kingdom, and containing many constructive proposals for collaboration, both now and in the future, in the field of science and of the humanities. These reports are being closely and urgently studied in London with a view to action. In the mean time there is an immediate prospect, in spite of transport difficulties, of increasing the supply to China of books, periodicals and equipment.

These are part of the contingent of close on a hundred students who were received as guests by St. Andrews University, and whose Matriculation, Tuition and Examination Fees were paid by the British Council for two years, in order that they might be enabled to take the degrees for which their residence and study qualified them. During the past quarter, scholarships have been given to one Dutch, three Maltese, one West African and two Polish undergraduates. Schoolchildren Contact has been maintained with all Allied schools established in the United Kingdom and the Council has assisted the Board of Education and the Scottish Education Department to enable H.M. Inspectors to pay courtesy visits to the schools. In association with the Belgian Government, the Council is arranging increased educational accommo dation to be made available to Belgian convalescent children at Morland Hall, Alton. The Belgian Am bassador has generously presented the home with a 16 mm. silent film projector.

Many French and Belgian children now attend the schools. Dominion, American and Allied Forces and Technicians POLISH ARMY The fifteenth course for selected officers and men has been completed at the Polish Military Bureau in Edinburgh. ALLIED AIR FORCES Regional Officers continue to visit R.A.F. stations to which Allied Air units are attached. They usually make these visits in company with a representative of the Directorate of Educational Services of the Air Ministry. Supplies of literature and other educational equipment have been continued to Russian, French, Polish, Czecho slovak, Belgian and Norwegian personnel. Arrangements have been made for groups of Allied airmen to make regular visits to London and Oxford, where they are entertained by the Council. An additional teacher has been appointed to the Belgian Air Training School. ALLIED EUROPEAN NAVIES Particularly in the South-West and Scottish ports, arrangements have been continued to enable Allied naval ratings to make special visits and to receive hospitality. The teaching of English in co-operation with the Admiralty continues satisfactorily. U.S. FORCES During the past quarter, U.S.A. Special Services Officers who are responsible for educational and socia^ facilities for all U.S.A. Forces in the United Kingdon^ have worked in growing and ready collaboration with the Council’s regional staff. This collaboration is demonstrated by the fact that the Council’s Regional Officers were the only civilians invited to address U.S. Army courses for the Special Services Officers, held recently in various parts of the country. The provision of a special news reel to U.S. Forces has been continued and extended. Numerous copies of British Council films and films descriptive of the life of other United Nations have been presented. Requests for Libraries, particularly from the U.S.A.A.F., have increased—in one day seventeen separate units asked for books on Britain and on the neighbourhood in which the units were stationed. Only periodicals of a professional nature relating to the peace time professions of the U.S. Officers and men are provided by the Council. U.S. Officers and men have attended the special leavs courses in Oxford and Cambridge in growing numbers. U.S. Headquarters have now asked the Council to initiate six experimental courses at other universities on their behalf. Arrangements have been made for lecturers, representative of the United Nations, including Britain, to address audiences of U.S. personnel—con versely, U.S. Officers and men have been enabled to address large audiences of British schoolchildre^ Officers and men of the U.S. Forces have taken part in various special excursions and have also availed them selves of the Council’s machinery to meet British repre sentatives of their own peacetime professions. Concerts provided by C.E.M.A. and financed by the Council, have been continued and are being extended to Aero and camp clubs established by the American Red Cross in Service Units. The first of a series of Information pamphlets for U.S. Forces, on approximately seventy towns, have now been issued. A club to be known as the Lions and Eagles Club has been established at Londonderry. Only British and U.S. naval ratings are eligible for membership. The Foreign Secretary and the Chairman of the British Council, as Trustees of an anonymous donation for the encouragement of Anglo-American Relations, agreed that a donation should be made from this fund towards the club. A grant from the same source was made towards the establishment of an Anglo-American Legion for British and U.S. other ranks in London.DOM INION FORCES Visits for members of the Canadian Army have been arranged to factories such as the Ford Works at Dagen ham, to farms and experimental stations, such as the East Sussex Agricultural College at Plumpton, and to places of historical interest such as Canterbury Cathedral, H.M. Dockyard at Portsmouth, Hampton Court, the Tower of London and Winchester. An average of forty-five such visits are being arranged each month and the monthly number of men affected is approxi mately 1,200. The A/Director of Army Education at Canadian Military Headquarters, has recently asked that this scheme be extended to the Canadian Reinforce ment Units. Broadcasts about this side of the Council’s work in the Canadian Army were made by Mr. Clifford Turner over the C.B.C. to Canada and over the North American Service of the B.B.C. In a number of ways the Council has assisted with the Leave Courses arranged for Canadian and other Dominion and Allied troops at British Universities. At some universities, e.g. at Birmingham, Sheffield and Edinburgh, the Council’s representatives have had a hand in arranging the programme. At others, e.g Oxford and London, grants have been made to the University to defray the costs of organization. More over, at all universities the Council has made it easier for Other Ranks to attend by paying two-thirds of their fees. These courses continue to be extremely popular. In addition to the courses at Oxford, Cambridge, Birmingham and Edinburgh, mentioned in the last Quarterly Report, further courses are being arranged at Sheffield, Reading, Aberdeen, Aberystwyth, London, Manchester, Cardiff and Swansea. These courses are attended by representatives of all Canadian services, and other Dominion officers and men also attend in small numbers. Collections of about 100 books, each dealing with British life, have been sent to all the Canadian hospitals. At four of them, performances of plays by the Pilgrim Players have been sponsored. An exhibition of water colours, drawings, woodcuts and prints by modern British artists has been on display for some months at No. 17 Canadian General Hospital. Individual contacts for men with professional or technical interests who are on leave continue to be effected. In collaboration with the Royal Institute of British Architects a reception was arranged at the Institute to enable architects in the Canadian Army and the R.C.A.F. to meet British architects and to visit the Institute’s exhibition “ Rebuilding Britain ” at the National Gallery. Scholarships have been offered to men who would otherwise be invalided out of the Canadian Services to enable them to continue their studies in this country. Details of this plan are being worked out with various Headquarters. INDIANS The first group of Indian pilots and cadet officers of the Indian Air Force to be trained under the Empire Training Scheme recently arrived in the United King dom. The Council was asked by the Air Ministry to give all possible assistance during their first days in this country. During the first week of their stay, the Indian pilots were entertained in a Northern town, at a reception which H.R.H. the Princess Royal graciously consented to attend. Arrangements are being made for the whole group to visit London on their first week's leave. Weekly excursions for Indian naval personnel are arranged in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and Indian seamen are included in many of the facilities the Council s Officers arrange in ports throughout the country. In Hull, arrangements have been made for regular film show's to be given at the Indian Seamen’s Recreation Centre, and in London it is hoped to arrange a series of visits in co-operation with the Indian Seamen s Welfare Officer. The seventh batch of Indian technicians to arrive in this country have visited Cambridge and previous groups have been assisted in Oxford and Birmingham—in the latter city arrangements were made for a joint meeting with the Birmingham Trades Council, at which a talk was given on the history of British Trade Unionism. DOMINION AND COLONIAL TECHNICIANS In the north of Scotland a successful beginning has been made in the task of educating the illiterate and near illiterate members of the Newfoundland Forestry Unit. Two hundred have been enrolled for courses. Teaching is being conducted in ten camps by about fifteen teachers. Pupils are already able to read and write. Similar schemes are in hand for British Honduras Forestry groups. West Indian technicians were entertained when paying a week’s visit to London. GIBRALTARIANS Regular film shows have continued at monthly intervals in twenty-nine centres, and classes in community singing and speech-training have been held. Visits have been arranged to the Tower of London and the Imperial Institute. Private Hospitality ami General Receptions The Council throughout the United Kingdom is coming to be regarded as the link between the people of this country and overseas visitors, and is having to arrange more and more special events in co-operation with civic and other authorities. Space does not permit detailed recording of the numerous activities organized under this heading, but the following examples may be of interest. 1. A number of activities were organized during May for a party of thirty-seven Turkish Flying Officers who w'ere about to return to Turkey. They visited the House of Commons, and afterwards took tea at the British Council. Later in the week, the Turks visited Hampton Court and returned to London in time to attend a tea party which had been arranged for them at the Turkish Halkevi. At the end of the week the Turks visited Cambridge, accompanied by the Turkish Air Attache. In addition to the activities organized for this particular party of Turks, a further visit to Hampton Court was undertaken by a smaller party of Turkish Flying Officers. These officers have also been taken over the offices of the Evening News. 2. In Scotland, to mark the third anniversary of the arrival of the Polish Forces in Scotland, a small dinner was arranged for General Maczek, commanding the first Polish Armoured Division. It was attended by representatives of all Fighting Services and the Govern ment Departments in Scotland. 3. The Council has organized a committee to provide suitable hospitality for passengers arriving in and departing from Britain by Swedish Air Lines. Group Excursions Throughout the country numerous excursions are organized ; for example, in the past quarter thirty-nine visits have been made to the Tower of London, eight to the offices of the Evening Standard, three to the Denham Film Studios. French Petty Officers and naval ratings have paid week-end visits to Salisbury ; in Cardiff excursions have been arranged for various nationalities to the dock areas and to places of historic interest in the neighbourhood. One hundred Javanese seamen were entertained on Princess Juliana’s birthday ; sixty Greek Naval Officers and men and a similar party of Norwegians visited a Roman camp and town in Northumberland. French airmen were entertained in London on their arrival from North Africa.12 In the London area, approximately 250 tickets have been distributed in rotation in schools, institutes, and hospitals, to personnel of the Allied Forces and Merchant Navy, for public performances of significant cultural value. In addition, 250 vouchers for the National Gallery concerts have been distributed regularly each week. Two hundred complimentary tickets for football matches, including the Cup Final, were distributed. Eight football matches were arranged for members of the Netherlands and Norwegian Merchant Navies. Similar facilities were made available in Glasgow and Edinburgh. At the request of the Ministry of War Transport, arrangements have been made for men of the Allied Merchant Navies and others to be entertained to dances in hospitals. National Houses and Other Centres a. POLISH HEARTH The last three months have shown that the removal of the Polish Hearth to much larger premises at 45 Belgrave Square, was more than justified. For example, it is estimated that the number of persons attending the Polish Hearth as members and guests has increased in the last three months to between eight and nine thousand. Fortnightly film shows are arranged by the Polish Hearth and are largely illustrative of Polish life and activities. Many of the films shown have been Polish films produced before the war, which have been sent to this country recently from the United States. H.R.H. The Duchess of Kent graciously attended a reception at the Polish Hearth on June 23rd. The President of the Polish Republic paid a visit to the Polish Hearth on May 10th, and took tea with the staff. The Saturday evening receptions for members of the Polish Forces and their friends have been continued. The evening is advertised in the Polish newspapers, and is usually attended by from 150—200 people of Polish, British and other nationalities. Other receptions included a joint Czechoslovak-Polish Reception. The demand for Polish lessons has so increased that a second teacher has been engaged, paid by the Polish Ministry of Information. The pupils now number 60. English classes are also much in demand and three teachers are regularly employed. Educational courses for Polish officers continue. New courses comprise a Technical Course for Officers of the Polish Air Force and another for Polish Military Doctors. b. CZECHOSLOVAK INSTITUTE Lectures included : Mr. Eric Newton, British Draught- manship, and Mr. Desmond MacCarthy, Irish Character in History and Literature. The latter lecture was the first of a series on English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish tra ditions. An exhibition of Czechoslovak Graphic Art, com prising about 150 drawings and prints, was held during part of April and May, and visited by about 900 people. Later the Exhibition was transferred to the Whitechapel Art Gallery. An exhibition arranged by the Association of Czechoslovak Scouts and Guides in Gr:at Britain was on view from June 16th to 23rd. During the period under review there were three recitals of modern Czechoslovak Music. A recital was given by Leon Goossens and Ivor Newton. Rena Moisenco arranged an evening of Soviet Music built round a gramo phone recital of Aram Khachaturian’s Violin Concerto. Following the successful performance of a concert version of Smetana’s opera, “ Dalibor ” in February, another Smetana opera, “ The Kiss,” was performed in the same manner at the Institute on May 20th. The Youth Group meets regularly every Wednesday and is attended by Czechoslovak and English young people. Five classes in English are in progress, and readings of English literature were given each w'eek until the end of May. Classes in Czech, Russian and Shorthand continue to be well attended by Czechoslovak and British students. Many organisations held their meetings or arranged lectures at the Institute. Several small and informal receptions were arranged at the request of M. Maxa, the President of the Czecho slovak State Council. The Czechoslovak Colony of France commemorated the Centenary of the birth of Louis Leger at the Insti tute, w'hen Professor Ren6 Cassin and Dr. Juraj Slavik addressed a gathering of Czechoslovaks and French, which included many distinguished guests. C. BELGIAN INSTITUTE During this quarter the Belgian Institute sustained a lamented and severe loss in the death of Mr. A. S. Buckland Cockell on April 23rd, after an illness of a few weeks. Mr. Cockell has rendered exceptionally devoted service to the Institute, and this devotion caused him to refuse to give up his duties until he was already very seriously ill. Mr. L. W. Bridges has accepted the post of Director of the Institute. In view' of the large number of members, it has become necessary to restrict the election of British members. These are now only accepted if they can show some definite connection with Belgium. Events organized by the Institute included fifteen lectures, a number of concerts and two Anglo-Belgian Receptions. English classes are progressing satisfactorily and i^ has been decided to begin evening classes for Belgia^ 1 and Luxembourg nationals who would like to sit for the London Matriculation next year. The Belgian Board of Education have agreed that under certain conditions, the Matriculation certificate will be considered equivalent to the Belgian “ Certificat d’enseignement moyen du degre superieur ” and will permit entry to the Belgian Universities. The Belgian Board of Education have agreed to subsidize this scheme. At the request of those attending the lectures on English Literature, Mr. Eric Gillett has begun a new series of talks on “ The Appreciation of Shakespeare.” The exhibition of paintings by contemporary British artists was opened by H.E. the Belgian Ambassador on 17th May. Meetmgs or receptions have also been held by many organizations. The success of the restaurant of the Belgian Institute continued, and an idea of its popularity may be gained from the fact that on one day no fewer than 162 lunches were served. d. YUGOSLAV HOUSE During the last three months there has been an encouraging increase in the number of members who make use of the House. The number of registered members is now 382, 2\M of whom are British. ^ On April 5th Mr. Martin Roberts gave a talk on “ The City of London,” illustrated by lantern slides, and on April 14th Mr. F. A. Voigt, editor of “ The Nineteenth Century and After,” spoke on “ The Political Wisdom of the English Poets.” His Excellency Dr. Pouritch was in the chair. A reception was given on May 4th, in honour of the President of the Polish Republic. His Majesty King Peter was present, and the function was attended by representatives of most of the Allied Governments. Three parties for younger members and their friends were held. The average attendance at these informal reunions is about fifty. Students from the School of Slavonic Studies came to each of these parties. There is now a waiting list of British members who wish to have lessons in Serbo-Croat. English and Yugoslavs meet daily for conversation exchange lessons ; there is an increasing demand, particularly on the part of British members, for this form of tuition. Classes in English continue to be regularly attended.C. BRITISH-NORWEGIAN INSTITUTE There are now 833 members, of whom rather less than one-third are British. Admiral Sir Edward Evans gave an illustrated lecture on Scott’s South Polar Expedition ; a number of other lectures were given. Many meetings were held by Societies in the Institute premises. Receptions included a Reception by the Royal Nor wegian Air Force for the Royal Air Force, and one lor the International Federation of Trade Unions. The popularity of language classes in Norwegian in creased, and they are now held regularly on four evenings per week. The restaurant continues to be used to its maximum capacity, and over 10,000 meals were served there during the first eight weeks of the quarter. /. GREEK HOUSE In the second quarter of its existence the House has grown in membership and popularity, despite the transfer of the seat of government to Cairo. The number of members exceeds 850, of whom less than half are Greek or of Greek origin. In view of this increase and the preponderance of British members, it has been decided to suspend election of British applicants, unless they can show special interests in, or connections with Greece. The restaurant and bar are now yielding a substantial trading profit. The average number of luncheons served gkas risen to between 40 and 50 ; the average number of ainners served is 30. The subjects of lectures covered a wide field—archaeo logical, artistic and topical ; and those dealing with Greek themes have made the widest appeal. Dances and bridge tournaments have been arranged and are well attended. The regular dances on Saturday evenings are much appreciated by members of the Greek forces. Lecturers and artists who have appeared at the House included Sir Philip Gibbs, H.E. Mr. A. Michalopoulos and H.E. The Greek Ambassador. The demand for lessons in modern Greek has led to the provision of a second course. The Anglo-Hellenic League has installed its offices in the House, and on Thursday, 6th May, held a reception for its members to meet the Duchess of Kent. g. NETHERLANDS HOUSE This House was unofficially opened on June 1st when a small party was given for those most intimately con nected with its promotion, including members of the Council and of the Executive Committee. An official opening ceremony will be held at a later date when the alterations and decorations at 16 Charles Street are fully completed. Although the House was only opened to inspection t the end of May, no fewer than 1,212 members had been nrolled by the^ 9th June and applications are still coming in in large numbers. There is a fully equipped restaurant which has already been well patronised, and on one day 90 luncheons have been served. There is a bar and a “ koffietafel or light luncheon room. At this early stage accommodation has already been allotted to the' following Dutch organizations A Children’s School under the Netherlands Ministry of Education. The Netherlands Women's Association. The Netherlands Fighting Forces Club. Captains and officers of the Dutch Merchant Navy. The School has been provided with four rooms, and the classes are already in operation. 11. INSTITUT FRANQAIS DU ROYAUME-UNI Among the lectures given in the Cours Publics Section in French, were the following : by the Rev. Vincent Godard on “ Jeanne d’Arc ; by Lt. Voisine of the Fighting French Forces on ^ Some Literary Manifestations of French Resistance ’ ; by M. R. Brunot, former Governor-General in the French Colonies, on the Colonial Electorates ; by M. F61ix Gouin, Deputy of Bouches-du-Rhone, recently arrived in this country, on “ The Political Psychology of the French People.” Professor Saurat continued his series of weekly lectures on “ The Present Situation.” The London-Polish String Quartet gave two recitals of French music ; in addition a programme of Franco-Scottish vocal music was directed by the Scottish Composer Francis George Scott. There were two performances of French plays by a Company directed by Edward Stirling and Margaret Vaughan (Directors of the English Theatre, Paris, 1924-1940). An international exhibition of 160 drawings and paintings with a “ regional interest ” was held. The “Faculty des Lettres ” Section continued its French language and literature classes, and the examina tions for the “ Licence es Lettres ” were held at the end of the term (provisional diplomas are awarded to be validated later by the University of Lille ; these pro visional diplomas are recognized by the Board of Education for payment to teachers at “ graduate rates ” under the Burnham scale). The “ Lyc6e ” Section (secondary and elementary schools, evacuated in Cumberland) was in the charge of M. Hugues, Censeur, in the absence on sick leave of Mme. Oakeshott, the Headmistress. The examinations for the “ Baccalaur6at ” are now being held. /. S CO TTISH-POLISH HOUSE The first series of the Boards of Enquiry came to an end on June 2nd, each Board drawing larger and more enthusiastic audiences than the preceding one. The final Board was composed of the Rt. Hon. the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, FEE. Monsieur Andre Michalo poulos, Professor A. T. Jurasz, and Professor V. H. Galbraith, the Scottish Regional Officer acting as compere. In addition to this forum for the exchange of ideas there have been concerts and readings from Shakespeare. j. SCOTTISH-CZECHOSLOVAK HOUSE On April 14th the inaugural lecture was given in the series “ Scotland and Czechoslovakia,” by Professor Sir Herbert Grierson, on Scottish Literature, and Monsieur Milos Sova on Czechoslovak Literature. This has been followed by dual lectures on Philosophy (Professor Kemp Smith and Dr. Jaroslav Cisar), Music (Mr. Francis George Scott and Mme. Patzakova), Religion (the Rev. G. F. Macleod and Dr. Lumir Soukup), Architecture (Mr. Hew Lorimer and Dr. Karel Vogel), Painting (Mr. R. H. Westwater and Miss Gutova), Tradition (Mr. Edwin Muir and Dr. Lumir Soukup). The visit of Dr. Jan Masaryk in April was the great event of this period, and a large gathering of friends of the House and of Czechoslovakia were invited to meet him. On April 19th Mr. T. S. Eliot lectured to a very large audience on “ The Social Function of Poetry.” As a hostel and leave centre for Czechoslovak Servicemen the House has never been so full, nor so thoroughly justified its existence. Approximately 200 men stayed in the House during these three months. k. SCOTTISH-FRENCH HOUSE A new series of lectures on ” What France Stands For ” was inaugurated on May 14th. This series com prises lectures by recognized authorities on the contri bution of France to European culture, grouped under the following headings “ The International Function of the Intellectual ” (Mr. Cyril Connolly, Editor of Horizon), “ French Religious Thought,” ” French Literature,” “ French Painting,” etc. Other events were lectures by Mr. Edwin Muir on the ” Poetry of T. S. Eliot,” and a reading of his own poetry by Mr. T. S. Eliot himself. The House has been much used by French Servicemen on leave, and parties have been arranged by the French residents in Edinburgh for special French units.14 I. SCOTTISH-AMERICAN CENTRE Primarily to house a collection of books presented by “ Books-Across-the-Sea,” Boston, and St. Andrew’s Society of the State of New York, a Scottish-American Centre has been created by the Council in Edinburgh. These books, published in America and dealing with America since the outbreak of war, are not available through the libraries of booksellers of this country. A parallel collection of books on contemporary Scottish problems is being presented by the British Council, and it is hoped that the Centre will be a focus of interest for Americans on leave. A committee has been formed on which representatives of the E.S.U., the Ministry of Information, “ Books-Across-the-Sea,” the British Council, the University of Edinburgh, the Lord Provost’s American Hospitality Committee, the Edinburgh City Libraries, etc., are included. The Convenor is Dr. H. W. Meikle, National Librarian of Scotland, and Historio grapher Royal. The Centre is at 29, Regent Terrace, Edinburgh. nu INTERNATIONAL CLUB, MANCHESTER A full and varied programme of a high cultural standard was carried out in addition to a large number of film shows and dances. Outstanding features included a week-end Drama School for foreign residents, including boys and girls from the Belgian and Czechoslovak Schools ; a confer ence for refugee workers in outlying districts ; and an International Conference of Teachers. Lectures on scientific, artistic and economic topics have been a regular feature, and included talks by Dr. Lambridis, Lady Jowett and Professor Fleure. Three parties for Canadian Army students were held and regu lar theatre visits and walks in the countryside. Parties for Allied wounded in hospitals near Manchester were also organized, and a special film show for Chinese residents. Speakers from eight different countries were sent to W.V.S. rest centres in Lancashire, to schools and to youth groups. The reception following the opening of the Belgian Exhibition was held at British Council House. n. ALLIED CENTRE, LIVERPOOL Considerably increased use of the House is being made by Allied seamen and members of the Allied and Dominion Forces, and a much larger number of meals are being served at the Canteen. A number of lectures were given, notably one by Air Vice-Marshal Janousek on “ Czechoslovakia’s contri bution to the War.” Increasing use of the House is being made by the groups of Allied seamen for professional meetings and for meetings connected with their welfare work. The weekly dance for merchant seamen has proved very popular ; thirty-nine dances were given for Mer chant Marine and Allied Forces, in addition to dances and socials given by the Anglo-Allied societies. On three occasions large parties of Indian and Do minion personnel were entertained at very short notice. Many concerts were given, both of classical and popular music. These included performances by a Polish String Quartet, International E.N.S.A. (on three occa sions), a recital of English and Polish music by Gordon Green and a recital of violin and piano music in co operation with C.E.M.A. Variety entertainments were held on two Saturday evenings. Parties of Allies were taken to a number of concerts on Merseyside. The extension of English teaching has been referred to above. Eight tours for Allied seamen were arranged to places of interest in Cheshire and North Wales, and one visit to a factory. Week-end tours for Norwegian seamen to Youth Hostels in North Wales proved very popular. Special Events .—During Easter week-end a visit of Chinese University students to Liverpool was lareely based on the Allied Centre. Empire Day, May 24th : Reception for Dominion and Colonial people, arranged in co-operation with the Empire Rendezvous, at which speakers were Sir Sydney Jones, The Viscount Leverhulme, Sir Angus Gillan, Sir Robert Rankin, Colonel McKaig and Mr. A.

CYPRUS ASSOCIATION Arrangements are almost now completed for the transference of the Cyprus Association to new and larger premises in Greek Street. p. SEVEN SEAS CLUB. LEITH This club has been used by increasing numbers of sailors and seamen of all nationalities. Arrangements are now being made to obtain more accommodation. q. OTHER CENTRES During the past quarter the Council has assisted the following newly opened centres : Two Hostels in Glasgow for Chinese Seamen The Netherlands Seamen’s Club, London The Balfour Services Club, London The Belgian Army Hostel, London The H.Q. Canteen of La France Combattante, London The American Merchant Navy Club, Cardiff The Overseas Club, Cardiff The Dutch Seamen's Club, Cardiff The Colonial Centre, Cardiff, which was opened on June 3rd by Colonel The Right Honble. Oliver Stanley, Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Merchant Navy Club, Swansea The Coloured Colonial Club, Barry The Polish Sanatorium, Northumberland, which has been sup plied with a wide range of educational equipment. Apart from the National Houses established in London, the Council has provided lectures and concerts for 116 Centres frequented by Dominion, Colonial, Indian or foreign personnel in the London area. Conferences of Allied Ministers of Education The President of the Board of Education, in colla boration with the Chairman of the Council, has now held five Conferences with his Allied colleagues. The basis of the Conferences has been widened, as Repre sentatives of the U.S.A., U.S.S.R., China, and of the High Commissioners of the Dominions and India now attend them. It is expected that China will arrange representation, now that the Chinese Ambassador has returned to this country. The Commissions so far appointed by the Conference have been : a. The Commission on Cultural Conventions. This Commission has completed its work and has sub mitted a report which has been unanimously, adopted by the Conference. The proposals contained^ in the report are fundamental to future cultural and educational collaboration on an international plane. b. The Books and Periodicals Commission under the Chairmanship of Professor Ernest Barker has held sessions both of the full Commission and of the Sub-Commissions, bi-weekly. Sub-Commissions are studying : i. Preparation of a history textbook, a handbook of suggestions for teachers of history, and a brief history of the war. ii. The restitution of books, objets d'art and scien tific material, which have been removed from the occupied countries by the Axis Powers. The Conference is also considering the following problems : a. Supply of scientific and laboratory equipment. b. Supply of films and other visual aids. c. Supply of educational material. (Other than books and scientific equipment.) d. Supply of educational personnel.The Conference has now passed from the stage of a consultative body to that of a body of action. The Representatives of the Board of Education and the Council on the Conference and Commissions are evolving by a natural process machinery of collaboration which will be of the greatest importance for the future, since, without doubt, some of the international action now being taken will expand and develop in the post-war period. [V —FUNCTIONAL activities a. Books and Periodicals book presentations From all over the world have come requests which show the increasing inteiest in problems of social welfare, economics and finance—and, indeed in all British plans for post-war reconstruction—and a careful choice has been made from the spate of books and pamphlets now appearing on these subjects, in order to secure balanced and intelligent presentation. Another topic in which interest is increasing is library adminis- trat jon—a welcome development because the usefulness of any considerable collection of books must depend largely upon skill in librarianship. the National Library of Algeria asked for standard books on economics and political and military history, and a joint presentation was airanged with the Ministry of Information. Five Consular posts in Morocco are ^eing sent monthly parcels of books. ' From Spain enquiries have come for bibliographical material, for British writings on the philosophy ot history and historiography and for scientific works. Russia has opened a vast book depot to re-establish the shattered libraries on her western borders. The Council has contributed to it and wall continue to make presentations to it or direct to specific centres such as the Lenin Library and the Central Library of Foreign Literature. Exchanges between scientific and literary institutions in this country and their Russian counter parts are increasing and a good deal of material has already changed hands. Specialized requests are beginning to be received from China, the latest for books on many branches of techno logy, such as ceramics, civil and electrical engineering, bridges, highways, rubber and textiles. South America continues to send requests and en quiries, as numerous as they are varied. Books have been ordered for school libraries and for teachers refer ence libraries in Brazil and on play production and stage craft for dramatic societies in Mexico and Chile. Text books on various subjects covered by their syllabus have been supplied to the Universidad Obrera in Argentina. The new scheme for sending quarterly parcels of recent publications to Institutes covers all the areas in ^ hich the Council works and the books will be of a ^milar nature to those sent to Consular and Diplomatic Posts, with a further consignment of works of more specialized interest for distribution by Representatives at their discretion. PUBLI CATIONS The Summer List of Publications, recently distributed, contains details of sixty-nine British Council brochures already published or in active preparation in English, Czech, Dutch, French, Greek, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. During the quarter 10,000 copies of the Council s publications ha/e been despatched to Representathes abroad for distribution. P ERIODICALS A collection of specimen copies of technical periodicals has been sent to Newfoundland to assist the Adminis trator of the Canadian Legion Educational Sei vices in the rehabilitation of disabled ex-servicemen. The arrangement of exchanges continues to develop, requests having been received recently, for example, from specialist journals in Spain, the Institut Framjais v de 1’Afrique Noire and Latin-Amcrican publishers and learned societies. Each involves contact with a number of British publishers or societies, and in many cases it has been found that the British institutions wished to resume exchanges, but had been unable to do so owing to present difficulties of communication. Requests were received also from the Royal College of Surgeons, the British Museum, the Imperial Agricultural Bureaux and the National Research Council of Ottawa for assistance in establishing or reinstating exchanges. Arrangements are being made with the Microgram Department of the Air Ministry and Aslib Microfilm Service for the microfilming of periodicals, or any other printed material, whenever this offers positive advantages. b. Export of Publications BOOK EXPORTS Orders are being received under the Book Exportt Scheme from Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. Mr. H. F. Paroissien has arrived in the Middle East, and proceeded immediately to Palestine, where he will report on the condition of the book trade, and will recommend steps to be taken to ensure a regular supply of British books. Books for Resale, (a) North zl/r/cfl.—Requests for books on sale have been received from North Africa. The Institut Fran 9 ais de PAfrique Noire and the Inspector-General ol Agriculture at Dakar have asked for a large number of technical books and catalogues, and a French Administrator in Algeria has asked for dictionaries. These are being supplied. (b) Turkey. —Books to the value of £1,750 are now despatched quarterly to the Representative in Ankara for resale in Turkey. Agency. —Larger supplies were arranged for schools, universities and individuals in countries where the Book Export Scheme does not function. Institutes and libraries which require to purchase regular supplies of recent publications can place standing orders by this method. Periodicals. —An increasing number of institutions and individuals, having appreciated the presentation of various periodicals, are now prepared to take out sub scriptions for them. TRANSLATIONS Requests for assistance in negotiating translation rights continue to be numerous ; publishers and agencies in' Portugal and Sweden have been availing themselves of this service for some time ; activities in Turkey and Switzerland are increasing ; and requests from Latin- America are now becoming more frequent. Swedish requests, which previously were mainly for fiction, have begun to include technical books. (HIBITIONS An exhibition of children's books opened in Portugal the spring. Arrangements were made with a London holesaler to receive orders by cable and the resulting ade was satisfactory. A books exhibition in Reykjavik was combined with an hibition of graphic art. The success of the exhibition as considered sufficient to warrant its transfer to The initiative of Mr. Scully enabled the Council to Tiibit at the Book Fair in Buenos Aires. A lecture ven by Mr Scully was attended by over seven hundred A P request has been received from a Lima bookshop &gt;r an exhibition of rare books and prints. The char- ner of this exhibition is chiefly commercial as every- ii n a is for resale. Peruvians are anxious to acquire 3 od English material and most of it will consist ot iventeenth and eighteenth century w'orks about our vo countries.16 BOOK REVIEWS The return of prcss-cuttines of published reviews and of broadcast scripts is increasingly satisfactory. In Portugal some of the most fruitful contacts are with University periodicals. Spain has produced reviews and bibliographical notes on English studies of administra tion, education, medicine and theology, and is asking, in addition, for works on architecture. From Sweden have been received a welcome supply of both requests for specific books and of press-cuttings. From Malta, book reviews are arriving much more often. A useful connection has been built up here with the Dominican quarterly, Scicntia. The first cutting from Science and Culture, an Indian periodical, has been received. In Turkey, new requests from a periodical named Arkitekt for books on architecture and town-planning, are being met by a monthly consignment. In the Belgian Congo a weekly service of radio reviews is now running. Brazil, where the Book Review Scheme has been ably handled and most successful, is sending a regular supply of review's from Sao Paulo, and from various periodicals in Rio de Janeiro. Chile maintains its interest in British agricultural methods, and in British books in general. From Haiti has come a request for medical books. In Uruguay reviews have been broadcast in English and Spanish. c. Britain To-day The circulation of “ Britain To-day ” remains stable at about the figure of 94,000. Care has been taken to ensure that it should not expand beyond ascertained demand, and that the whole of its circulation should be effective ; but there are some directions in which it will be necessary to provide more copies in the near future —in Canada, in Australia and in North Africa. In the United States the journal is distributed on the basis of sales only ; in other foreign countries it is free except when supplied through trade agencies. In Chile, where in general the distribution is free, an agency has ordered 400 copies for sale. Letters have come from many parts of the world with enquiries about subscription rates. Material published in “ Britain To-day ” secures further publicity by the use made of it in foreign news papers and by individual journalists. d. Drama The Council continues to send British plays to Sweden, Spain, Argentina and the U.S.S.R. and to act as inter mediary in any negotiations for translation and performance. The supply of plays continues to British institutes, dramatic clubs and play-reading societies abroad. e. Films The Director of the Council’s Film Department visited Spain and Portugal during the quarter. 2. Documentaries. The following films were in active production :— Technical Education Caernarvon (Colour) School Broadcasting Men of Science (Colour) Canterbury Cathedral Piccadilly Roundabout Development of the English Town Indian Ocean (Colour) National Health Social Assurance The Life Cycle of the Onion (Educational) Invention of the Steam Engine (Educational) Steam Turbine (Educational) History of the English Language (Educational) A number of other films are in various stages of preparation. The Board of Education have appointed a Committee of five H.M. Inspectors of Schools to assist the Council in the production of class-room films. REPORTS The following are extracts from some of the reports received during the quarter :— India. —“ Films supplied to the Government of India by the Council are placed in a Film Library maintained by the Government of India and operated by the Director of Information, Bombay. Films from this library are lent to Governments, semi-Government institutions, private institutions, and individuals throughout India. Two or three copies are made of films for which a demand is anti cipated and the pictures are kept in constant circulation. It can be safely said that every British Council picture is shown in every Province and many of the States in India ...” Mcdta. —The Council’s Representative reports : “ Cinema shows for senior children, boys and girls, from the Government schools have been given in the afternoon on days when shows are given for members and these have helped to widen interest in Great Britain in an important section of the community ...” Persia. —The Public Relations Bureau reports : “ It will interest you to know that we have started to show films to the schoo^ children of Teheran in co-operation with the Persian Ministry Education. Hitherto we have shown one programme (including three British Council films) to 29 school audiences.” Portugal. —“ The Mocidade put on a programme of British documentary films at the cinema belonging to the Secretariat of National Propaganda—The proceedings were opened by Dr. Leite Pinto, who is in charge of the foreign relations of the Mocidade, with a short speech very friendly to Britain, in which he said that the programme had been provided by the British Council ; and that it showed —among other things—aspects of the training of British youth in different forms of sport, and served as an explan ation of why a nation so trained has been able to adapt itself so quickly to the necessities of war.” Tanganyika. —The Secretariat reports : “ From such comments as have been heard, these British Council Technicolour films are very much enjoyed by the more highly educated section of the community for their subject and the art displayed in execution and by the masses for their colour. . . . ‘ Gardens of England ’ was adjudged to be of particular merit and was greatly appreciated in Dar es Salaam where it was exhibited—at a special show in aid of the Poppy Fund.” Venezuela. —The Council’s Representative reports that “ the Ministry of Labour writes that four films, recently returned to the Institute, were shown in eleven suburbs of Caracas, and in five workers’ centres. In the former, the audiences numbered 6,500, in the latter 1,500, and in both the films were well received. Eleven films lent to the Ministry of Education were shown in 58 elementary schools in the Federal District to 11,290 pupils and three other films in 17 public theatres of the capital to special audiences com posed of 20,669 school-children. In addition, these films were toured through Eastern and Western States of the Republic ...” DISTRIBUTION One hundred and eighty-nine prints, including dupli cate negatives from which further prints can be taken, were sent to fifty-four territories overseas for exhibition in public cinemas. Four hundred and eighty-four prints, of which 195 went to British institutes and Anglophil societies, were sent to thirty-two territories overseas for use in schools and institutions. A number of films on medical subjects, previously viewed by a small panel of doctors, were sent to Sweden, Spain, Iraq, Turkey and other countries. Prints were sent to Turkey for the Smyrna Fair and to Spain for the Barcelona Samples Fair; a 16 mm. sound projector was sent to Spain for the exhibition of these films. Arrangements have been completed for commercial distribution of the Council’s films in Spain. Film commentaries are now recorded in ten languages ; a number of films have been subtitled in Arabic. FILMS OF BRITAIN 1 942- 1 943 The new illustrated catalogue, with introduction Mr. Philip Guedalla has been issued. 9 f. Fine Arts EXHIBITION OF BRITISH CRAFTS IN U. S. A.

British News (the Council’s composite British newsreel) has been distributed weekly to thirty- two Colonies with the co-operation of the Colonial Office and the Ministry of Information. Copies are also sent to H.M. Missions in Portugal and Panama. The Exhibition of Children’s Drawings, which received generous publicity in the Press, was held in the premises of the National Academy of Fine Arts, Buenos Aires. Arrangements for its display were undertaken by the Argentine Commission of Intellectual Co-operation in colTaboration with the Argentine Commission of FineArts and the Asociacion Argentina de Cultura Tnglesa. The two principal speakers at the inaugural ceremony were Dr. Guillermo Rothe, the Minister of Justice and Public Instruction, who opened the Exhibition, and H.M. Ambassador, Sir David Kelly. Dr. Rothe was accom panied by members of the Diplomatic Corps, the President of the National Commission of Fine Arts, the National Commission of Culture, the National Council of Primary Education and the Asociacion Argentina de Cultura Inglesa. The Exhibition, which was open for a week, was seen by over 3,100 people. It was later trans ferred to Rosario, where it was displayed in the Museum of Fine Arts, arrangements being undertaken by the Comision Municipal de Cultura, the most important cultural organization in Rosario, in collaboration with the Asociacion Rosarina de Cultura Inglesa. A large crowd gathered for the inaugural ceremony, which was attended by the Mayor and other dignitaries. It proved one of the most popular exhibitions that had ever visited Rosario and was seen by nearly 12,000 persons. MODERN PAINTINGS, U. S. A. This exhibition is now at the Museum of Fine Arts Houston, Texas, and has been well received. BRITISH GRAPHIC ART —PERU This collection of prints, first shown at Buenos Aires, is on exhibition at Lima. During the first week of the exhibition the visitors numbered about 400 a day and after the first fortnight the Ministry of Education asked ^Ihr it to be kept open for another week to enable some of the schools to visit it. H.M. Minister wrote as follows: “ The effect of such an exhibition sent out in war time is profound amongst the intelligentsia and it is no less certain that the general public have shown their appreci ation by their attendance in large numbers and close study of the exhibits ... It has caused an indelible im pression in Lima and done much to dispel the prevailing idea that the British are occupied entirely with com merce.” MODERN BRITISH WATER COLOURS—SWEDEN After visiting Gothenburg and Stockholm this collec tion was shown in Uppsala, Linkoping, Lund and Malmo. The total attendance at these exhibitions was 12,610. The Representative reports that “ the exhibition did a great deal to awaken Swedish interest in contemporary British art.” The Stockholm “ Tidningen ” wrote : “ Fifty English water colours is not much, but it is something, and under the present conditions one is thankful for any bridge, however small, which culture builds between us and the fighting nations.’ All the paintings have been returned safely to England. CONTEMPORARY BRITISH ART FOR SOUTH AMERICA • The works despatched from this country arrived safely ^t Montevideo. Mr. Maxwell, the Director of the Bristol Art Gallery, is on his way to take charge of the Exhibition arrangements and to give a series of lectures. EXHIBITIONS FOR NATIONAL CENTRES IN LONDON A collection of contemporary British pictures has been shown at the Belgian Institute, where it was opened on the 17th May, by H.E. Baron de Cartier de Marchienne. MODERN BRITISH GRAPHIC AR T T U R K E Y A representative collection of recent prints was des patched to Ankara. The exhibition in Ankara was opened by the Chairman of the Council, attended by the Secretary-General of the People’s Party, the Minister of Education, by members of the Foreign Ministry and a large and representative gathering. There was an extremely favourable Press and a strong wish has been expressed that there should be a permanent collection of this kind in Turkey. The exhibition at the Halkevi at Brusa was opened on May 28th, by the President, Dr. Semsettin Dora, before a large audience which included the Mayor, the head of the City Council, and a large number of the leading personalities of the town.

The exhibition which was combined with an exhibition of books and contained a small number of photographs of the English town and countryside, was opened on June 1st. The ceremony was attended by 200 people including the Regent and Madame Bjornsson, and the Prime Minister. The attendance has been high and the sales so numerous that it is doubtful if any of the exhibits will be returned. The exhibition opened at Akureyri on June 19th. AKB AR EXHIB ITION The exhibition assembled for the celebrations on the 400th anniversary of the birth of Akbar the Great at the premises of the Royal Society last November, has been sent to the West Indies for exhibition in several centres, opening at Trinidad. COLOUR PRINT E X H I B I T I O N — L A PAZ This exhibition of coloured reproductions, originally prepared and sent out to Lima at the request of H.M. Minister, was opened on February 26th in the La Paz Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sponsored by the “ Departa- mento de Cooperacion Intelectual.” Of the 49 works shown 44 were sold. g. Lectures In May, Sir Lawrence Bragg, F.R.S., Director of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, visited Sweden and lectured in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Uppsala. His subjects for general audiences were “ Seeing Ever Smaller Worlds ” and “ Metals,” and for scientific audiences “X-ray Optics,” “The Structure of a Pro tein ” and “ The Strength of Metals.” He was able to renew old friendships with eminent Swedish scientists and to make several new ones. The Astronomer Royal, Sir Harold Spencer Jones. F.R.S., visited Spain and Portugal in early May and lectured to audiences interested in astronomy. His subjects were “ Greenwich Observatory and its Work,' “ The Earth as a Clock,” “ Measuring the Sun’s Dist ance,” “ Exploring the Universe,” “ Life on other Worlds,” and “Atmospheres of the Planets.” The Council arranged for Sir Charles Bressey, the town planning expert, to visit Spain at the invitation of the Spanish Government. His lectures were well attended by eminent Spaniards, including the Director General of Architecture and the President of the Academy of Fine Arts. Mr. John Steegman lectured in connection with the exhibition of historical prints which he organized on the Council’s behalf in Reykjavik, Iceland. It is with profound regret that the Council record the death by enemy action of Mr. Leslie Howard, on his return journey from Spain and Portugal. Mr. Howard lectured in Madrid and Lisbon on “ The Making of a Film ” and “ A Modern Actor’s Approach to Hamlet ” ; he had been very well received and the many expressions of condolence received from both countries pay tribute to his personal qualities and to the value of his mission. The manner of his death caused consternation and anger among Spaniards and Portuguese alike. h. Medicine “BRITISH MEDICAL BULLETIN” Four numbers of the English and Spanish editions of British Medical Bulletin have been published. The18 first number of the Portuguese edition has appeared. The Rector of a leading Swedish medical teaching centre has expressed his approval ofB.M.B. and recommended that 1,000 copies should be printed in Swedish for distribution to medical men and institutes. The Representative in Turkey has arranged for a stencilled edition in Turkish to be produced in the Ankara Office. The first number of this has appeared under the name “ Ingiliz Tib Biilteni.” Five copies of B.M.B. are sent by fast bag to Chung king. A message has been received from Dr. J. Needham that a selection of the matter is being translated into Chinese in Chungking. The more convenient format of B.M.B. has made it possible to engage in a wider distribution than was practicable with the bulky stencilled abstracts. The total number of instances of publication of the medical abstracts is 4870. With an average length of 400 words per abstract the total number of words published was therefore approxi mately 1,700,000. A letter has been received from a Brazilian broad casting organization in which it is claimed that the medical abstracts will be used for a w'eekly feature, “ The Brazilian Medical Hour.” MEDICAL LITERATURE RECEIVED Large numbers of overseas journals are still received in exchange for the material sent. Recently over 700 copies of such journals were passed to suitable British medical libraries. SURGICAL MISSION TO THE U.S.S.R.

ROUTINE OUTPUT The routine output of the London Letter, articles, Facts About Britain and War-Time Sport, continued to 214 points of distribution. The means of distributing the written material pro duced by the Press Division has been extended and developed. Saving of time and bag space has been effected by the despatch of material by microfilm.

Mr. Makin, in Cairo, has asked for two reference copies of each of the 37,000 prints now stocked in the Council’s offices by the Photographic Unit, and these prints are being prepared and sent in batches at intervals. SPECIAL REQUESTS Many requests for special articles were complied with during the quarter. PUBLICITY 1,300 news items on the Council’s work appeared in the British Press, and about 632 cuttings have been received from Empire and Foreign papers. VISITS Transport difficulties have seriously interfered in the extensive programme for journalists’ visits from Latin- America arranged earlier in the year by the British £^mcil, in conjunction with the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Information. It is, however, likely that a delegation of six Mexican editors will arrive in this country some time during August, and individual guests from other Latin-American countries are expected to arrive singly or in groups during the rest of the summer and autumn. A party of eight West Africans will be entertained in this country by the Council in July or early August. The Hon. Mabel Strickland has accepted the Council’s invitation to spend a fortnight as its guest inspecting various aspects of Britain’s war effort, the arrangements made for the Allies, etc. k. Science MONTHLY SCIENCE NEWS The distribution of the Spanish edition of Monthly Science News in South’ America has increased from the initial 4,000 to 17,000. The distribution of the Portu guese edition in Brazil has increased by 2,000. to 4,000. There is evidence from Press cuttings and letters that Monthly Science News is much appreciated in the South American Republics. Increasing use is being made of Monthly Science News in the Press in all countries in which it is distributed. Over 300 Foreign Press cuttings have been received and a similar number from English newspapers. A special eight-page number of Monthly Science News with four pages of illustrations is being printed in July to commemorate the Centenary of Rothamsted.

Joffe for the use of the Science Bureau of VOKS. * A collection of scientific books and papers have been received from the Head of the Book Department of the Academy of Sciences in Moscow for distribution to British scientists. Further requests for exchanges of publications between British scientific libraries and the Library of the Academy of Sciences have been dealt with. A number of requests for scientific information have been forwarded to Kuibyshev and a few replies received. ANGLO-SOVIET FILM SHOW A selection of British and Soviet scientific films were shown at the Curzon Cinema on April 16th, at which H.E. the Soviet Ambassador was the guest of honour. About 300 guests, including many visiting scientists, were present. ENGINEERING SCIENCE Thirty-three articles were accepted during the period under review. These have been sent to Turkey, Egypt, South America, South Africa, the Colonies and else where. Twenty-six have been translated for Latin- America and Portugal. An illustrated brochure on British Engineering achievement is being compiled. This will show, in picture form with short descriptions, how civil, mechani cal and electrical engineers in this country have contri buted to world progress. The Engineering Department has advised on the placing of members of the groups of engineering students from Turkey and China. SCIENCE MISSIONS AND LECTURES As reported elsewhere, Dr. Joseph Needham is at present in China on a scientific and cultural mission. Sir Lawrence Bragg visited Sweden in April and lectured on X-Ray Analysis. Sir Harold Spencer Jones visited Spain and Portugal in April, and lectured on Astronomy. 1. Students Two groups of students arrived in London early in June. Ten Chinese, nine of whom were Council scholars, were followed a week later by six Turks, five of whom were Council scholars. The Council has increased the number of scholarships allotted to Chinese students from the 20, which were agreed upon in the last quarter, to 50. Of the first group, seven are Engineers, one a Chemist, and one an Economist. The five Turks belong to a group of twenty Engineers sent by the Turkish Ministry of Economics to be trained in this country. They are undergraduates and are to take their degrees here. Whilst detailed arrangements for the courses of all these students were being made, a good deal was done20 to entertain them in London. They attended the Sadler’s Wells Ballet, visited the Tower of London, the Museums and examples of ancient and modern architecture, and were given maps of London so that they might make their own explorations. The Chinese were met by Lord Teviot, a Member of the Parliamentary Commission to China, were taken to a debate in the House of Lords, and shown over the House of Commons. Scholarship applications from the following countries are now being received : Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Cyprus, the Dominions, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Greece, Guatemala, Iceland, Malta, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Salvador, Sierra Leone, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Uruguay, Venezuela, West Africa (Gold Coast), and the West Indies. The Council, is offering 180 scholarships and there is some chance of increasing the number during the year. A Ministry of Labour and National Service Committee has been formed under the Chairmanship of Mr. Malcolm Macdonald, M.P., to consider the question of the ad mission and training of technical students from overseas. Sir Eugene Ramsden and Professor S.J. Davies represent the Council on the Committee. The Committee has only begun its work, but the question of giving technical training to a large number of Chinese Middle School graduates is being considered. Three students have returned to their own countries on the completion of their scholarships : a Portuguese doctor who has been doing valuable work in the Rad- cliffe Infirmary, and two Icelandic students. m.

From Latin America enquiries have come for books on play production and the theatre, arts and crafts for a Workmen’s College, English language study and teaching, education, agriculture and banking. b. Britain To-day The circulation of Britain To-day now exceeds 121,000 copies. Special arrangements have been made for putting on sale the resumed French edition in French North Africa through French booksellers. The advance orders from the trade are for 5,000 copies sold at the price of 5 francs each. Copies of this edition will also be sold in Canada, and distributed in French colonies and Switzerland. New arrangements have been made for the distribution of an English edition in the United States and Canada. In the former Britain To-day has hitherto been distri buted to subscribers only by British Information Services in New York. Henceforward, it will be printed in Canada from moulds sent out from England by air mail, to be published both in the United States and Canada by Messrs. J. M. Dent and Sons of Toronto. Distribution in both countries will be on the basis of sales. The first consignment of 5,000 copies of Britain To-day for Australia and New Zealand was bought in this country on full trade terms, the cost of shipment and distribution being borne by the publishers, Messrs. Angus and Robertson of Sydney. In Latin America the distribution of the Spanish and Portuguese editions is still on a free basis. In Argentina circulation has been limited as a result of an investigation poll to 15,059 persons who have asked for copies and 4,941 others selected for special reasons. c. Drama The Council helped to entertain Professor Solomon Mikhoels, the Russian actor and producer of Shake speare, while he was in this country. Mr. Terence Rattigan’s play “ Flare Path ” and other plays have been produced with great success in Sweden, and Mr. Priestley’s “ Time and the Conways ” had an excellent press in Buenos Aires. The Council was instrumental in arranging these productions. On the 150th anniversary of the Sao Carlos Theatre in Lisbon the Council sent a telegram of greeting on behalf of the London Theatre Council, the Society of West End Managers, British Actors’ Equity and the Theatrical Managers’ Association. It has supplied acting copies of Shakespearean plays to Switzerland, where the Zurich Shakespearean Festival is in progress. d. Export {Publications) BOOK EXPORTS Following his visit to French North Africa, Mr. Paroissien, Commercial Books Officer, in conjunction with the representative in Algiers, arranged with the French Comite de la Liberation Nationale and the North African Economic Board for the import of British books into the French North African Empire. An initial order for Algeria alone, valued at well over £12,000, has been received. Books for Resale. —(a) Turkey. —Books have been supplied to various Turkish institutions, including the Ankara Entomological Research Station, the Ministry of Education Translation Bureau, the Library and Faculties of the University of Istanbul, the Military Doctors’ School, Ankara, several booksellers, and numerous individual purchasers, including many medical men. The despatch for resale of books selected in this country has continued. A general selection exceeding £1,000 in value has been sent, and a monthly supply of £150 worth of technical works ; 600 volumes of the Everyman Library have also been despatched each month. (b) Spain. —The Council has arranged the supply of urgently needed books, mostly on mathematical, scientific and technical subjects. Subscriptions to periodicals have been arranged. This procedure is temporary, and normal trade arrangements will in due course render it superfluous. Help has also been given to Spanish booksellers who wish to get in touch with British exporters, and arrangements have been made to speed up the arrival of books required by official institutions in Spain which dispose of their own sterling allocations. Book Export Scheme. —Initial orders have be^^ accepted from bookshops in Barbados, Mexico and San Salvador. Orders from many new bookshops in Brazil are now reaching this country as the result of Mr. Scully’s mission. Owing to improved shipping conditions in the Mediterranean, the Book Export Scheme is now operating satisfactorily in Malta and Cyprus. Agency. —An increasing number of orders for books against repayment is received from individuals in countries where there is no direct trade between local bookshops and British suppliers. Books have been despatched to purchasers in the Belgian Congo, Paraguay, Portuguese West Africa and Sierra Leone. TRANSLATIONS The Council’s help has been increasingly sought by Spanish publishers who wish to produce British works in translation. A large number of reading copies have been sent to Sweden as usual. In Algiers the publication of several works in trans lation has been arranged. EXHIBITIONS ^ Swedish medical circles have asked to be broug!^ into touch with recent British medical developments, and an exhaustive selection of medical books of the first rank is being sent in triplicate to Sweden for simul taneous exhibition in Stockholm, Uppsala and Lund. These medical exhibitions will be kept up-to-date by periodic additions of all recent medical books of scientific importance. In this way a permanent “ shop window' ” for British medicine will be maintained in the three principal University towns of Sweden. Books and pamphlets on education, health, housing, agriculture, industry and recreation have been sent to the Post-War Planning Exhibition in Cairo. The Council has assembled a selection of books dealing with British life and scenery and with fishing, the principal industry of the Faroes, for a small exhibition of books at Thorshavn, arranged in conjunction with the Ministry of Information. BOOK REVIEWS Books are sent regularly to new contacts in Algiers, notably Renaissance, Fontaine, L'Arche and two journals devoted to sociological and economic studies. Economic15 works arc also being sent to the Belgian Congo for review by a professor of the University of Louvain ; the broadcast review service continues. In Spain works have been sent for the first time for notice in Revista de Estudios Politicos, Revista de Medicim y Cirurgia de Guerra, and two official periodicals dealing with agriculture, Surco and Frutos. Cuttings have been received from all the regular sources and newly from Moneda y Credito, Boletin Mensual de Informacion and Revista Nacional de Arquitectura. In Sweden a review of F.S.P. has led to a demand for translation. Books have been sent for the first time for notice in Hem i Sverige and two agricultural journals. Material has been supplied to a Swiss literary publication, Lettres, for a number devoted to modern English poetry. From Brazil, cuttings have been received from thirteen papers of literary, technical, scientific, sociological and general interest; and notably from the official organ of the Brazilian Civil Service. e.

We are directing our effort towards regular weekly projections to the same groups and schools, and have found that our audiences are more receptive each time. Because of your co-operation, our library is rapidly approaching a state which enables it to present a well-balanced programme of instructive entertainment for these weekly group shows.” New Zealand.—The Director of Education writes : “ The films you are sending are particularly valuable in helping New Zealanders to gain an understanding of the British way of life. Even those which are far removed from what might be termed propaganda, such as “ The Newt,” give a respect for British science and research.” Southern Rhodesia. —The Information Officer, Salisbury, reports . “ I wish I could convey to you an adequate idea of how welcome these films are to people out here.” Venezuela.—The Institute Cultural Vcnezolano-Britanico reports' that it has lent films to the Ministries of Labour, Education and of Health and Public Assistance, and has organised projections in the Catholic Men’s Union, the Model Prison, in the Masons and Waiters’ Trade Union, the Workers Centre organised by the Ministry of Health and the Workers Centre in the parish of Las fVfprrpHf'S f.

Periodicals Exchanges between British scientific and specialist periodicals and those of other countries are becoming an increasingly important part of the Council’s work. Recent advances have been the re-establishment of pre-war exchanges for the Institut Pasteur of Algiers, the introduction of Turkish periodicals to English Universities and learned societies, and the exchange of material on veterinary science with Latin America. Work in Syria, the Lebanon, the Sudan, New Caledonia and Morocco, previously on a small scale, has considerably increased. The improvement in trans port facilities has made it possible to send bulk supplies of periodicals to Persia, Egypt, Turkey and Palestine. Commercial mails are again being received in Switzerland and despatches of periodicals on a small scale for a tr(^T period have been resumed. From the Empire have come requests for periodicals likely to be of interest to women and children using health centres. Copies of the new quarterly publication on Health Education has been supplied to health officials, schools and training colleges throughout the Colonies. Work for Seamen’s Clubs has been greatly extended with the help of the Ministry of War Transport. Microfilmed periodicals sent to China at Dr. Needham’s request, for inclusion in the Sino-British- American Microfilm Service, have been increased from 34 to 90 : of these Nature and Discovery are reviewed weekly in the B.B.C.’s China service with a covering announcement that the microfilms are presented by the British Council. Back numbers and current issues of specialist periodicals have been obtained for the National Science Society of China, the Schezuan University and the Chinese Air Force. Four Ministry of Information Reading Rooms in China have been supplied with a comprehensive selection of periodicals of general and literary interest.k. Press OUTPUT The routine output (daily and weekly) of London Letters in Empire, French and Spanish editions, articles and weekly features such as “Facts About Britain,’’ “ Wartime Sport,’’ “ Theatre and Films in Britain ” and “ Women in Wartime,’’ has been sent to the press through 217 centres of distribution. Articles supplied at special request included feature articles for the Ministry of Information, chiefly for use in China and U.S.S.R., a series on architecture for Buenos Aires, articles on education for Quito and articles on the British film industry for Stockholm. publicity Mentions of the Council’s work increased to 1,600, including wide publicity in the national newspapers for new British Institutes in Spain and Portugal, the Allied Lawyers’ Foyer in London, and the work of the Council representative in Turkey. The Evening Standard devoted thirty column-inches in its chief feature within a month to the Council’s work. The Sunday Chronicle published a full-length article from the Chairman on the work of the Council. A broadcast talk to West Africa on the Council’s work was given by Mr. John Fisher. It will be followed by talks broadcast to the West Indies and Cyprus. Six broadcasts on the Council’s work have been arranged for the B.B.C. Pacific Service. IRA n[s MISSION OF SCIENTIFIC literature From October to December 1943, approximately 100 transmissions of scientific literature have been handled. These include letters, reports, papers on original research, and published books, which have been sent on to scientific societies, government research departments, and to individual scientists in this and other countries. Sweden and Spain have been particularly active in this respect, and through the efforts of Mr. Gill, French North Africa is beginning to take part in this work. ANGLO-SOVIET SCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION COMMITTEE The Academy of Sciences has resumed sending its publications on an exchange basis to a number of institutions in this country, following the arrangements made by the Council. Steps are being taken to centralise the material as far as possible in the Science Library, South Kensington. To make the fullest use of this scientific Russian material, the President of the Board of Education, on the recommendation of the Anglo- Soviet Scientific Collaboration Committee, has instructed that an additional member of staff be appointed to the Science Library with special qualifications in Russian. A letter received from VOKS in Moscow indicates that their Scientific, Agricultural and Medical Sections are finding the reprints of English scientific papers sent to them of great value. •v ■. JfSITS Dr. Santos, the former President of Colombia, has expressed to the Foreign Office his gratitude to the Council for the arrangements made during his stay in this country. Other information in regard to visits and receptions is given under “ Activities in the United Kingdom ’’. PHOTOGRAPHIC UNIT 67,740 photographic prints and 44,624 stereos were issued. A series of photographs covering the day-to-day life of a Member of Parliament, the work of the Royal College of Surgeons, including the Fellowship examina tions, most of the Allied Houses in London and the provinces, and the work of the Impington Village College and Community Centre has been made available for use in exhibitions, film strips and Council publications. 1.

A number of enquiries for further information on the subject matter of articles have been passed on to the authors for reply. SCIENCE IN CHINA Transport breakdowns have protracted Dr. Needham’s tour of the North Western provinces of China. He has made valuable contacts with the machine works plant at Lanchow and the oilfield in Northern Kansu, from both of which requests for books and apparatus are being met by the Council. ENGINEERING In collaboration with the British Standards Institution a general programme is in contemplation for the trans lation of selected British Standard Specifications into Turkish, Spanish, Portuguese, French and Arabic. Ten specifications are already being translated into Turkish. Professor S. J. Davies left London in November to carry out a tour of the Middle East, including Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Persia, which is estimated to last some three months. Mr. H. H. Mardon is deputising for Professor Davies during his absence. The Council has been asked to assist in filling twenty- nine scientific and engineering academic posts overseas, and has given advice on many questions affecting the education and post university employment of foreign students of engineering in this country. CONFERENCE OF ALLIED MINISTERS OF EDUCATION Dr. E. F. Armstrong is chairman of the Commission on Scientific and Laboratory Equipment, and Mr. J. G. Crowther is Secretary.

Requests were received from the U.S.A., Canada, Switzerland (including the League of Nations Library and the League of Red Cross Societies at Geneva) and elsewhere. The Director-General of Medical Services MEF requested 120 copies monthly for British, Dominion and Allied hospitals in the Middle East. The total circulation of the English-printed edition amounts to 1,500 copies. In addition 1,000 •1 ficopies are reprinted in Sweden. Numerous requests for back numbers have been received, but nearly all are out of print. The Spanish and Portuguese editions have a circu lation of 1,250 and 600 copies respectively. The Turkish edition, published from the Council’s Ankara office, has been well received in Turkey. The Turkish Ministry of Health provided names and addresses of hospitals to which Ingiliz Tip Biilteni should be sent, and recently asked that a copy should be given to each of the 450 Turkish doctors attending the Eighth National Medical Congress. Requests for copies of ITB have been received from Cyprus. The total number of recorded instances of publication in overseas medical journals of mimeographed medical abstracts (which preceded BMB) and of BMB material is 6,454. MEDICAL INFORMATION Requests for medical information, many of which arise from references in BMB to recent medical work in Britain, were received from several countries. As examples, memoranda on medical education in Britain and a large number of syllabuses and prospectuses from British Medical Faculties and other Examining Bodies were sent to Argentina and Chile. A list of psychiatric clinics and professors was sent to Spain. Supplementary information on a new treatment reported in BMB was sent to Turkey. Detailed information on blood trans fusion was sent to the Haemotherapeutic Centre of the Argentine Army (this resulted from a number of BMB dealing largely with blood transfusion). Information on medico-social care of the disabled and infirm was sent to Switzerland. Several bibliographies on special medical subjects have been prepared for enquirers in various countries. Other examples of requests are drug lists from British pharmaceutical manufacturers ; photo static copies of medical articles ; regulations for pharmaceutical examinations ; preparation of yellow fever vaccine ; catalogues of medical X-ray appliances ; information on asthma research ; information on control of manufacture and marketing of vaccines and sera ; biographies of British medical nutrition experts. In some cases information was obtained from overseas for British enquirers. In several cases copies of medical articles not available in this country were obtained. Information on the regulations governing the procurement of bodies for dissection was obtained from several countries for the Ministry of Health. Suggestions for articles on health education in other countries were supplied on request to the editor of the Health Education Journal. MEDICAL BOOKS AND PERIODICALS The following lists have been prepared :— i. An annotated list of fifty British medical and cognate periodicals for representatives. ii. A list for a Medical Book Exhibition in Sweden. iii. An annotated list of 100 medical books to be used in connection with the opening of Medical Sections in Institute Libraries in Egypt. iv. An annotated list of sixteen medical subjects for wall photographs to be displayed on the opening of these Medical Sections. v. A list of medical books and photographs for a model medical library in the proposed Argentine- British Medical Centre in Buenos Aires. OVERSEAS MEDICAL GRADUATES Programmes of study have been discussed with eleven overseas medical graduates, who are in this country as British Council scholars. Contact with them is maintained during their period of study, and advice given on the selection of books and other matters. MEDICAL FILMS Particulars of a number of medical films seen by the Medical Viewing Panel were circulated to overseas representatives. The Council film, “ Surgery in Chest Disease,” has been shown in Cambridge, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Harrogate and elsewhere to medical audiences, and has been very well received. Surgeon Rear-Admiral G. Gordon-Taylor, the surgical member of the Council’s Medical Panel, made special visits to Cambridge and Cardiff to introduce the film. SURGICAL MISSION TO THE U. S. S. R. Surgeon Rear-Admiral G. Gordon-Taylor, Mr. E. Rock Carling and Mr. R. W. Watson-Jones, members of the Mission, have given many lectures in different parts of the country and have been impressed by the widespread interest in Soviet Medicine. Mr. E. Rock Carling is to deliver a Friday Evening Discourse at the Royal Institution on Soviet Surgery. MEDICAL VISITORS TO BRITAIN Dr. J. A. Maia de Loureiro, Professor of Public Health at the Faculty of Medicine, Lisbon, visited Britain for three weeks as a guest of the Council, and arrangements were made for him to meet experts in different public health subjects in various parts of the country. Dr. A. Lamas, Medical Adviser to the Companhia Uniao Fabril, made a private visit, but introductions and other arrangements for him were organised by the Council. o. Students The work of dealing with students has expandol rapidly, both in numbers and in the type of work whi^P scholarship holders now undertake. The Council has scholars in this country from thirty- seven foreign countries and from six different regions of the Empire. It is also in touch with groups of foreign Government scholars, who are independent financially, and is nearly always asked to advise on their courses, to undertake the whole task of finding them places in universities, firms or appropriate institutions, to make suggestions for vacations and to assume responsibility for their entire welfare. The largest number of foreign Government scholars now arriving in this country is from Turkey. Twenty arrived during this session, and ten are on their way ; a further contingent are expected in the spring. Contrary to the general rule that students should have a knowledge of English before arrival in England, it has been agreed that Turkish students shall learn English in this country. Those who have arrived are taking classes in English for foreigners at Regent Street Polytechnic, and a special Christmas vacation course has been arranged for them in Devonshire, where they can stay with English families and receive daily tuition in English. Recently the Universities China Committee asked the Council to place thirty scholars whom the Boxer Indemnity Trustees will shortly select in China. Tjj^ Council is also in touch with the Federation of Brii§l7^ Industries who have a special scheme for Chinese apprentices, mostly graduates who wish for a period of practical training. The expenses are borne by the Chinese Government and the Federation with a sub stantial contribution from the Council and from the Universities China Committee. Thirty-one apprentices have reached this country ; a further thirty-two are expected. The Council offered thirty-five scholarships to the Chinese Government for the current session ; ten scholars have arrived, and a further twenty-five should shortly do so. Both the Chinese Government and the Council are in touch with all the scholarship schemes, and with those students who wish to come at their own expense, so that the Council is able to see that every student from China is adequately placed in a University or place of training. The type of work undertaken by Council scholarship- holders and by foreign students included in any of the schemes mentioned above varies widely. Some students are very senior, even of professorial standing. The Director of the Brazilian Department of Public Healthwhich deals with the whole question of Child Welfare (health, delinquency, welfare, etc.) is spending fourteen months in this country to make a report on English methods. He has visited the appropriate departments of the Ministry of Health and the Home Office ; he has studied the practice of the institutions dealing with child welfare in London and the larger towns ; he has visited universities and juvenile courts, etc., and been introduced to the leading authorities on his subject. Several scholars at Oxford and Cambridge have been offered senior status by the Colleges. The majority of Council scholarships are awarded to young men between the ages of 25 and 30, who have graduated in their own countries and already obtained considerable experience there in their own field. For instance there is a consider able group of young doctors who qualified some years ago, and whose work in their own countries has led them to wish to undertake a period of specialised work in England. A number of engineers are doing research work at Universities while others are having direct practical experience. Two are working under the City Engineer of the Tame and Rea Drainage Board at Birmingham. There are a few undergraduates amongst Council scholars, but the policy of the Council has in the main been to allot scholarships to graduates who have already had the opportunity of proving their worth. Scholarships are taken up in every variety of subject : music, engineering, literature, scientific research, veterinary surgery, medicine and many other subjects. iBlpecial course for the training of teachers of English has been arranged at Nottingham University College. p. Visual Publicity EXHIBITIONS AND PHOTOGRAPHS U.S.S.R .—Material sent included a further series of exhibition portraits of British Men and Women of Culture for VOKS and others, and more exhibition photographs of British industry and industrial life.

Illustrations of British Architecture and Painting and of the work of William Blake were also Sent. Uruguay .—A report from the Legation at Montevideo on the British exhibit at the Sixth International Salon of Photography states that the British exhibit “ attracted so much attention, and was so widely appreciated, not only in photographic but in artistic circles in general, that its cultural, and even propaganda, value has been inestimable.” Spontaneous requests have been received for its exhibition in the interior of Uruguay and in Argentina. Other photographs sent out included British geo graphy, towns, education, social welfare and sport (Sweden) ; agriculture, child life, education and other subjects (West Africa) ; architecture (Egypt, Persia, China, Portugal, Malta) ; painting (Palestine) ; library planning (Director of the National Library, Mexico) ; the Women’s Services (all Institutes) ; Great Britain (Spain, San Salvador and Home Division Centres) ; comparative views of Great Britain and America (American Centres).
