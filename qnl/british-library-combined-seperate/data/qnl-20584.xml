Letter no.234 of 1854 (folios 19-22) from Kemball to Commodore George Robinson, Commanding Officer Persian Gulf Squadron, dated 26 June 1854, in which Kemball requests that the Honourable Company’s vessels
                           Tigrisand
                           Clivebe despatched to Bahrain to restore tranquilty to the area. Kemball includes a detailed description of the maritime trade dispute which led to renewed hostilities between Shaikhs Muḥammad bin Khalīfah and Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh, and the difficulties that Robinson will likely encounter in reconciling the two parties, particularly in respect to Dammām’s situation within Wahabee [Wahhābī] territory and its relations with the Wahhābī ruler;2. A summary translation of a letter (folios 23-24) from Hajee Jassim [Hajjī Jāsim], the British Agent at Bahrain, to Kemball, dated 29 May 1854, describing the circumstances leading to an incident in which two pearl fishing boats from Dammām were seized by pearl fishing crews from Bahrain. After this incident, Shaikh Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh’s fleet took to sea and captured ten boats belonging to Bahrain.3. The translation of a second letter (folios 24-26) from Jāsim to Kemball, dated 1 June 1854, in which Jāsim describes a conversation he has had with Shaikh ‘Alī bin Khalīfa regarding the hostilities and their resolution.4. The translation of a third letter (folios 26-27) from Jāsim to Kemball, dated 6 June 1854, describing further hostilities at sea between vessels belonging to Bahrain and Dammām.5. The summary translation of a letter (folios 28-29) from Shaikh Muḥammad bin Khalīfah to Kemball, dated 8 June 1854. Shaikh Muḥammad states that members of the Al Boo Felasa tribe residing in Dammām wished to return to Bahrain. He provided them with funds to pay off their debts to Shaikh Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh, however the latter impounded the property of the Al Boo Felasa. This incident provoked the first seizure of Dammām pearling boats by inhabitants of Bahrain;6. The translation of a letter (folio 30) from Shaikh Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh to Kemball, dated 13 June 1854, giving his side of the story regarding the circumstances and hostilities between Dammām and Bahrain;7. The translation of a letter (folio 31) from Kemball to Shaikh Muḥammad bin Khalīfah, dated 26 June 1854, in which Kemball indicates that he considers Shaikh Muḥammad’s subjects the intitial aggressors in the hostilities between Bahrain and Dammām, and that reparations will be made upon him, by Commodore Robinson, who is on his way to Bahrain;8. The translation of a letter (folio 32) from Kemball to Shaikh Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh, dated 26 June 1854, in which Kemball requests Shaikh Muḥammad to punish those of his subjects responsible for seizing the Bahrain boats.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000007#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
