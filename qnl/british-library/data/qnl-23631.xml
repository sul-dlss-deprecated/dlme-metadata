T meanwhile was going from one room to another spurring on tie hnghish office and the Confidential Office to complete the preparation of their way bills etc. asf soon as possible. Airing the course of my wanderings, I r. Abdur ahman gave me a couple of bags which I under stood from him were for lushire. As 3 Hi^ ; e !p a** Jbag was ready, I ^rove-t' d ^ all the three bags post haste to the Auharraq bridge/ as tne half hour l entioned by r. leaned at 10-40 had already come to an end and I r.

Thomas and talked to him about the arrangements for send ing his v/ife and sister-in-law over to ushire v/ith such luggage as he might not be able to take with him I i-eturned to the Agency. 4. The initial mistake over the bags was, I suppose, i.r. Abdur ahman’s, but I would strongly request that no ''black mark 11 is made against him for it, as he has been suffering regularly and at timedacutely from asthma since he cam here in anuary and, whereas many others might have yielded completely to the disease and done no work at all, he came to the gency on many days when he might well have stayed at home and worked most con- scientously during his time here. e was ill at the time and just about to leave -ahrain on leave. ~ : e no doubt saw the two bags on the ead Clerk’s Lable and assumed that they wer for ushire. ihe fault is also mine for not checking up that these two bags were for Bushire. Had it not been for the extreme rush wit; which3 - the 'ushire mail had to be prepared, the mistake . would not have been made. 5. It may be asked why it was that we did not dis cover the disappearance of the L^ushire bags in time to stop their being sent v/ith ,j'. ihomas. -he reason is uhat these bags were not, as is normally the case, collected by ,r. ^teele and handed over personally by him to the I^ead Clerk, as Ir. 3tee_e did not have occasion to go on board the 'William 1 ing’J Instead, these two tags were handed over by the Captain of t he 'William ding ' 1 to 'ray Mackenzie, who rang me up and asked me to send a farrash to collect them. the far- rash did so and, as narrated above, put them on the Head Clerk's table without any one giving a r eceipt for them. I nave passed orders that, in future, telegrams that we receive f rom us/jire announcing the despatch of mail to us are not to be filed after arrangements for taking delivery of them from the ship had b &gt;en made, but are to be put up to me after the bags have actually been opened by me and their contents found correct.
