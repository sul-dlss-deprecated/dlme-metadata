Wood stuccoed and painted. \r\nEars erect, muzzle closed. Painted black, white used to outline eyes and brows; red ribbon about neck. Alert, keen look but not much detail. Ears not at all hollowed out. Presumably from a recumbent figure of the Anubis jackal, which once surmounted a Canopic box or coffin of other funerary furniture. \r\nCondition: A vertical crack through the stucco, all around the head, just at back of eyes suggests to that jaws were of a separate piece of wood doweled to remainder of head. Tips of ears and now slightly chipped but these injuries not noticeable, mostly in stucco rather than wood. Some stucco chipped from forehead between eyes and at base of ears and base of neck. \r\n", "medium": "Wood, stucco, pigment", "dimensions": "6 3/16 x 5 5/16 in.
