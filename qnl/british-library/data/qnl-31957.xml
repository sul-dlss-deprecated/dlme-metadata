SEGHET EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF DEFENCE COMMITTEE MEETING Ei,IiD m.h Jagg-jy. (D. 0.(48) 5th Meeting), SUPPLY OF AMS AND EQUIPMENT TO FOREIGN ND COMMON VEALTH The Committee considered a note by the Minister of efence (D.0.(48) 11) covering a report by the Joint -far Praduction Staff on the supply of arms and equipment to foreign and Commonwealth countries. This report made the following recommendations (i) The vital importance of maintaining armament exports to friendly countries should be taken XUlly into account in the reshaping of the pattern of the Jniled Kingdom export trade which was now being carried out in order to meet the economic crisis. (ii) The production of Naval, Array and Air Force arms and equipment to meet foreign and Commonwealth orders on the largest practicable scale should be approved. (iii)The Service Departments should be authorised to invite foreign and Commonwealth Governments to indicate their probable requirements, oju the understanding that theie would &gt; e a reasonable prospect that these requirements could be met, subject to satisfactory negotiations as to delivery and financial settlement. (iv)The War Office stocks required for minimum war reserves and essential maintenance should not be further deptyletec in order to supply foreign requirements. THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE stressed the importance of the export of arms and equipment from the point of view of the maintahance of an actuate war potential in the United Kingdom, and said that, if the general propositions in paragraph 3 of D.O.(48)11 were approved, he would work out detailed proposes in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and'the President of the Board of Trade. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE SXCHEqUER said that he could rot accept the general propositions set out in D.O.(48) 1'. Thus,/ while there might be good strategic reasons, for exporting 1 arms and equipment to Holland, it was very doubtful whether we could, in present circumstances, afford to use valuable 1 materials, sue as steel, for exports which, from the economicl point of view, would be unrequited. Each case mist, in his ^ view, be considered on merits, regard being had to the economic factor and he could rot, t erefore. agree to the suggestion in paragraph 3(3) of D.O.(48) 1] that the Dervice Deoartments, in inviting foreign and Commonwealth Governments to indicate their probable requirements, should give an assurance that there was a reasonable prospect that these requirements could be met. THE MINISTER OF DEFENCE said that it had always been intended that the decisions on individual cases should be taken in consultation with the Overseas Negotiations Committee.r matmmmam TO- ^ - 1 mm sMMKX He realised that it might not be possible to assure foreign and Commonwealth Governments that there was a reasonable prospect that their requirements could be met, but it was essential that some approach should be made to these Governments with a view to obtaining a comprehensive picture of potential demands for United Kingdom arms and equipment on which decisions could be taken in the light of both the strategic and the economic factors. Further points in discussion were:- (a) THE CHIEF OF THE AIK STAFF stressed the importance, from the point of view of the security of the United Kingdom, of arpplying equipment for the Air Forces of countries such as France, Belgium, Holland, Denmark and Sweden. The French Government were known to be particularly anxious to obtain further supplies of equipment from the United Kingdom. (b) THE MINISTER (F SUPPLY said that orders from foreign countries for aircraft would be very welcome, but that there would be difficulties in supplying arms or equipment which made heavy cemands on steel.or which could not be produced without discontinuing the production of civilian type goods in ordnance factories. (c) THE MINISTER OF LABOUR pointed out that there might be resentment among workers if they were ealledupon t o produce such items as military clothing for export to foreign countries at a time when clothing fbr civilian coasumption was severely rationed. (d) THE MINISTER OF STATE pointed out that account would c, have to be taken of nolitical considerations as well as _ ' of strategic and economic considerations in deciding whether arms and equipment should be suppli d to particular countries. (e) There was general agreement that the proposal to ? rant special treatment to Iraq must be held in abeyance or the present and that there should be no modification of the present policy of supplying no arms to China. The Committee (1) Agreed that there were military advantages in supplying arms to as many foreign and Commonwealth countries as possible, but that each case must be judged on its merits in the light of the relevant political strategic and economic considerations.(2) Took note that the Joint &gt;Var Production Staff would arrange for all specific proposals Ihr the supply of arras and equipment to foreign countries to be referred to the Overseas Negotiations Oomaittee and that any cases in which agreement could not be reached would be submitted to the Defence Committee.Ext. 5067/43 Extract from the Military Attached Summary of Intelligence No. 47 for the fortnight ending 26th December; 194.7 1(c) Afghan officials have expressed their gratification at the offer made by the Dominions of India and Pakistan to train further parties of Afghan army officers and N.C.O.s and at the assurance given by His Majesty’s Government that they will continue to take a friendly interest in the prosperity of Afghanistan,ITW KABUL TBLEG-SAM No. Date ♦ ♦ Regmt to: v/ashirigton (3aving) Karachi Hew Delhi TOP J,3CajT daressed uo Kabul telejron o of 'February, 1948 repeated lor information to ; 'ashingtoa, ITev; Dell..i andKarachi.

I iNDEXEU Id, v’ V L You are probably aware of the arrangement known as 'Scheme Lancaster' under which the Government of Indio in 1946 undertook to supply the Afghan Government with a considerable amount ©f arms and military equipment for the sum of 16 million rupees which the Afghan Government were to pay off in ten annual instalments of 1^ million each* Our last letter on the subject was m y demi- official lettex Mo^683/44 of June 27th 1947 t© Crichton. TEe file is presumably'stIir^vrtir'you but I enclose a copy of the aide memoire given by me to the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 3rd July 1946 which forms the basis of the arrangement, and which, through an oversight, does not appear ever to have been sent to the Government of India, though the offer was accepted and has been acted on. 2. Considerable quantities of supplies have already been delivered and more have I understand been packed and are ready for despatch. Apparently however the Defence Department placed an embargo on all further issues on the 18th of July and the Supreme Commanders Headquarters before it closed down informed us that nothing more could be done at present and that the papers had been transferred to Army Headnusrters India. 3. I am bringing this case to your notice as the payment ©f the second instalment by the Afghan Government will fall due in February next and they will undoubtedly want to know what the present position is. I very muc^ hope that it will be possible to complete delivery in accordance with the original agreement as this was made by His Majesty’s Government as well ss by the Government of India and it is obviously politically desirable from many points ©f view that it should be implemented if possible. »*©uld it be possible for you to give me for communication to the Afghan Government some indication of the views of the Government of India in this matter I •• --.V' * • v '\r?V'.s K% Yours sincerely, Sd.G.F.SQUIRE 1a Shankar Bajpai, K.D.E.,C.I.E., Ministry of External Affairs and Commonwealth Relations, India, New Delhi.

' vfato ^ Miaaz r$ v Your first question raises political issues which are rather beyond my competence. I should have thought, however, that the agreement for the supply of equipment to Afghanistan was one of the liabilities which the Dominion Government of India took over from the old Government, and that they would not repudiate it, although I recognise that the interests of the Dominion Government of India in Afghan affairs may not be identical with those of the old Government. The position in regard to the ownership of stores has changed since the agreement was made. The Government of India \l acquired ownership of all military stores in India as from the Z' Hist April, 1947, at a price to be negotiated in connection with the sterling balance discussions. This ownership, however, did not extend to what are described as War Office and Air Ministry 'earmarks H &lt;&gt; I do not know Y/hether the stores intended for Afghanistan were included in the War Of Tifin. earmarks or not - possibly the Army i^uiipniiwi'I j jfSranch can say - but I should imagine not. Exactly how the cost^of supplies to Afghanistan since 1st April, 1947 have been accounted for, I do not know, but 1 should imagine that India has assumed that the stores are now her property, and that she has not credited H.M.G. with 65 ; £ of the value (the cost of such stores being included in the cost of all stores acquired by India on 1st April, 1947 referred to above), and has taken as^ accruing to Indian revenues any payments made by Afghanistan. If, as I assume, the stores for Afghanistan have qot been treated as War Office earmarks, I do not think theWar Office now come into the discussions as to the balance 01 material to be supplied except on the policy level. 17.10.4-7Mr. Donaldson.

Lancaster* Military Attache, &amp;abul, for Mr. Uchard ^llen, iouth East Asia Department of the Foreign Office, London on 7th October, 1947, This note is In the form of an Aide-Memoire and deals with our existing coromitments with the Afghan Government in relation to the supply of military and air force equipment etc, to them from India and the training of Afghan army and air force personnel either in Kabul, India or elsewhere in the Empire. It has been and will, I consider, continue to be of the utmost importance that Great Britain and the Dominions of Pakistan and India should implement the arrangements entered into in 1945-1946 for the supply of military equipment to the Afghan army and for the training of Afghan army personnel in its use. This consideration also applies to the assistance given to the Afghan Air Force since 1957 by His Majesty's Government and the former Government of India. I think it can be said that the help given to Afghanistan in this direction has been of inestimable value to the .rapire during sorld v,ar II in keeping the Afghans neutral anu level in their attitude towards Inaia, has resulted in a greater degree of cooperation in regard to tribal affairs on the Aorth lest frontier of India between the Afghan and Indian Governments, and led to the Afghan Government aligning themselves ideologically more closely with Great Britain and the U.3 ,a. rather than kusaia, I am convinced that, so long as we can supply Afghanistan with her requirements in military and air force equipment sufficient for tribal policing and with her essential supplies of petrol, sugar, tea and piece goods etc., we shall be contributing toward® the maintenance of peaceful conditions on the Korth lest frontier of India, be assisting the new Domini oa of Pakistan to establish itself and develop good relations with Afghanistan ami possibly x&gt;rev«mting a drift towards Aussie which might come frosa a feeling of frustration on the part of the Afghans should we fail to kelp them in their military affairs, in the supply of essential imports and in the development of their resources. It is to my mi nu dangerous for the new Government of Pakistan should we permit the G.3.A., inexperienced as they are in Aorth est frontier affair®, to embark on the supply of military and air force equipment to the Afghan Government, since they may end by providing equipment and training superior to that of the Pakistan Dominion.^ It would be equally dangerous should we or the U.S,A. supply a/T/C guns, a/a guns or more than a few light tanks to Afghanistan, as such a procedure would arouse Russian suspicion® and lead to a deterioration In iiusao-Afghan relations anti more kusaian activity in Afghanistan and India, The com-uitmeate we have already entered into with the Afghan Government have not ao far aroused much Russian suspicion, as they are moderate and cater for tribal policing and the maintenance of peaceful conditions in the country am particularly on the North A eat frontier of India. The transfer of power in India from British to Indian hand® somewhat earlier than wa® anticipated took the Afghan® by surprise, and they have shown anxiety about a possible vacuum /vacuum in tribal control on the Indo-&lt;fghan frontier, the * continuance of British interest in nfghan affairs and of the assistance given to them in the past by His majesty’s Government ana the former Government of Inula in supplying military equipment and providing British instructors to the Afghan army and air force and the grant of training facilities for Afghan personnel in India. ihould Great Britain and the new dominions of India and Pakistan deny to Afghanistan the help she has received in the past from his Majesty’s Government ami the former Government of India in the military and economic spheres, we shall lose a great deal of prestige, create further difficulties for Pakistan, particularly in respect of cooperation in tribal «#££lr 8 on the Jnno-afghan frontier, give the U. dS.R. further scope for upsetting the political position in Central -sia, pave the way for a spreau of Communism to India and risk losing many fghan friends. It is, : think, advisable to encourage the U. .Ato assist fghaniatan in developing her coimnuni oat ions, trade ana resources in every possible way, since the presence of American technician® etc, in the country promotes stability. 1 am, however, doubtful (in view of the inexperience of the Americans; of their entry into the military and air force affairs of the country. In succeeding paragraphs of this note 1 mm giving details of our present commitments ana what I know of the future requirements of the afghan Government. I would like to stress the necessity of early decisions regarding our future policy, as the Afghan Prime ^ini&amp;teF, War winieter and the Chief of the General Gtaff are pressing for definite replies to their approaches which have already been the subject of correspondence between the British Legation, kabul, the India Jffiee and the Foreign Office, London. xisting commitmeat8 in regard to the Afghan aray and probable future Afghan requirements are as follows; (a) An agreement for the supply of military equipment to the value of approximately 00 million Indian rupees, the cost to the ..fghan Government having been reduced to R. 15 million payable in ten annual instalment*. The first instalment was paid in February 1947 and the second ia due in February 1948. Possibly one third of this equipment has reached fghani®tan from India ana Afghan requirements in artillery are still the subject of correspondence. The delivery of the balance of the equipment due requires attention. (b; The training of two batches of 150 Afghan &amp;r,i&amp; officers and H.C.Oa in India for one year. The first batch of officers ana H.C.Qs completed their training in December 1946 and the second party will complete its training in April 1948. The training is provided free of charge, but the Afghan Government pay the salaries of their personnel while in India ana transport charges to and from centre® of training. The Afghan Government will probably ask for further facilities in future year® for smaller numbers, preferably under British instructors, in the Dominions of Pakistan or I mils. ™ ~ (c) The temporary loan of British B.C.Q. Instructors to the Afghan army in Kabul for perioaa of three months to one year. Four H.C.Os have been in Kabul so far, the Afghan Government /Government paying their salaries and such local allowances as are necessary. They arrive end carry out their duties in nufti cl thUi v for which the fghan Government allow s grant of approximately £57-10-0. (dj The training of a few ,,fghan officers in special subjects in 1 ft** 1 a or England as required. (e) The supply of spares and replacements for British type equipment already delivered and the supply on payment of other minor requirements. Our existing commitments in regard to the Afghan Air Force and probable future Afghan requirements are as follows 5 . ~ (a) The supply of spares for Hawker Hind aircraft. lb; The aupply on cash payment of 12 ,.vro Anson XIX aircraft with five years spares. Lt.-Col. Abdur Easaq has now arrived in London to sign a contract with the manufacturers for these aircraft. The Air Ministry are dealing with this problem. (c&gt; The supply on payment of 18 to 24 new or second hand operational aircraft suitable for tribal policing, together with five years' spares. (d; The grant of training facilities in Karachi or elsewhere in India for .fghan air force personnel'&lt;5r'aTl grades inducing pilot® under auspices up to s total of 299 or such less number as can be accepted. Alternatively the setting up of a Flying Training School under M.a.F. instructor® in Kabul. The jj, a.

(e&gt; The grant of facilities to two or three selected Afghan pilots for advanced flying training in India, Pakistan, Kngland or elsewhere. ^ (f; he provision of reliefs for i.A.F. instructors at present attached to the Afghan Air Force in Kabul, at present these consist of$- Pilot Instructor /Leader G.F.

Abdur ^asaq Lhan to London, be sounding him a® to the actual help required by the fghan Government. In view of the importance of maintaining peaceful condition* on the North . est frontier of India and a stable and friendly government in Afghanistan, I recommend that decisions be reached at the earliest possible moment concerning the degree of assistance we can offer to the Afghan Government In military and air force matters. These decision® should be made known to the Afghan Government through the Legation in r abul as soon ®s possible, since they wish to know how they stand so that they can frame their future policy, I think the Afghan Government*s attitude towards Pakistan and possibly towards Aussia may be determined by the degree of assistance we can give them in military and economic matters and the amount of moral backing afforded to them by Great Britain and the^ II# a# a. (a*G, Lancaster) Colonel, Military Attache, Kabul. London, 7.10,47.L. Fetch, Esq., Treasury. crv&lt;JL&lt;iA,.cS\v • I enclose copies of letters which have passed between the Government of India and Kabul regarding the policy to be adopted in the application of concessional purchase rates for additional articles required now by the Afghan Government. Your letter No.3.40511/2 of 26th April, 1946, gave your concurrence to the Government of India's original proposals. You will see from the Government of India's letter of 21st May that the Afghans have asked for certain additional equipment in a List 1A and cancelled others in a List 1B. I enclose copies of these lists v/hich have just arrived and which we have not previously heard of. In the meantime, pending receipt of the Government of India's view^in the matter ^we would endorse the views expressed by Squire in para. 6 ofhis letter to Crichton of 27th June. Politically it is important at this stage to give the Afghans no loophole which they might interpret as any change in H.M.G’s policy. V/e think, however, that there must obviously be either a time limit on the application of the concessional rate previously agreed or a ceiling cost expressed, and that this should be made clear to the Afghan Government. The question for consideration by H.M.G. is whether they would be prepared to extend the concessional rate previously agreed with the Government of India to cover a further order of 15.63 lakhs over and above the original order of approximate 300 lakhs. The extra amount involved is small but the benefit to the Afghan Army is great, and in view of the political effect which might result from a re^etfal on our part I strongly recommend its acceptance. It might indeed encourage the Government of India to be generous on their part if we could send a telegram at once to India agreeing to accept this addition under the original terms rather c*than just asking for their views.

So, §83/44. c i^l 1 9 3 My dear Crichton, S47 British Legation, Kabul, 27th June, 1947, Please refer to Low’s Secret JD ^Q, no. F.16&lt;5)-tiWA/47 f dated the 21st May, 1947, on the surjectof 'Scheme Lancaster'* It is correct that the offer of concession rates does not automatically cover the items in list 1A and we are in no way committed to the supply of these additional articles on the same terms. The Afghan Government, however, naturally hope that the same conditions will be applied and looking at it purely from their point of view it seems that their hopes are reasonable. If the original offer to supply at half the cost price represents, as I believe it does, a very fair settlement, in view of the fact that much of the equipment supplied is not new and, even if new, would very possibly have had to be sold as scrap had it not been required by the Afghan Government, it would seem fair, as well as saving a great deal of trouble to all concerned, that the total supply should be included in a single comprehensive scheme. 2. The principal items involved are of course the wheeled carriers and the artillery. As Low says in his letter there is a good case for the supply of the 49 wheeled carriers which I understand would cost about Rs. 800,000 in place of the 199 tracked carriers at F.s. million - &amp; reduction of something over Rs. 2f million. 3. As regards the artillery the original scheme was for twenty guns of five different sorts to be supplied whereas the Afghan Government have now asked for 48 guns of two patterns only, the increase in cost amounting to about Rs. 5£ million, 4. It is also I think relevant to consider the question of 24 tanks and 6 armoured cars which we are under an obligation to supply to the Afghans if suitable patterns can be found, but which in fact I understand have been unable to find so far* and which it is possible that we shall never supply. This would reduce the value of our offer by some 3 million. 5. Assuming that these values are more or less correct it does not look as if the total supply (including the items contained in List 1A) will greatly exceed the estimated value of Rs. 30 million and this is in my view an additional argument for including whatever supplies are now under discussion within the scope of the original agreement. 6 . If we were to insist on treating the additional, supplies as outside the terms of the agreement and charging the full value, whatever that may be, the Afghans would certainly interpret this from a political point of view and would imagine that our changed attitude was connected with the political changes in India. I do not however think that we need necessarily give very much weight to such considerations, More important is the consideration that it is important from the point of view of the Government of India that the Afghans should not be encouraged to go elsewhere e.g., to America for their supplies of military equipment which under the present arrangements is becoming Increasingly British, a very obvious advantage if any formform of co-operation between Afghanistan and the India of the future in the North-West Frontier tribal affairs can t be secured as well as in the event of hostilities in the future between the two countries. « understand to be one of the main considerations in the letter under reference, i.e. t the question whether the Government of India should bear their share of th® concession i.e., 15 percent of the list price. This is, I think, a matter to be considered between iondon and Delhi. 8 . I am sending a copy of this letter to Donaldson. These arguments do not deal directly with what I Yours sincerely, Sd. G.F.

There is one exception to this; we might be considered to be bound to apply the concession rate to the Wheeled Carriers in List IA, ns these are in lieu of the Tracked. Carriers in the original agreement* The cost of the Indian share of the concession, i.e. 15JS cf the list price, in respect of items on List IA excluding Carriers, comes to about Rs. 7i lakhs, although experience has shown that the final cost is liable to vary. It' is possible that the full 15jC added to list prices to cover variations may not be required in the case of List IA as it includes ammunition which involves no spare parts* 4 . Before a final decision is reached in this matter, it snents necessary to consider whether the original negotia tions in any way commit us to the supply of these additional articles on the same terms end what the Afghan reactions would be if the present 50concession were withdrawn In whole or in part.

I have been informed that Afghan Government have now asKed Skoda if they can deliver the 10 tanks as contracted and possibly a further 10((‘?total) 20) all of 10 tons. Negotiations are proceeding. 2. This is presumably result of our failure to offer any suitable light tank, and though in some ways unfortunate may not be entirely disadvantageous. Russians may well object to Afghans possessing tanks which are hardly required for tribal warfare, if Skoda are prospective suppliers we shall at least escape consequent complications, Russians will also be unable to complain that we have monopolised supply of arms, •3. Afghan Government are also enquiring about possibility of purchasing from Skoda further supply of Bren guns pattern Z.B.30, Number mentioned is less than 1,000. Afghans already possess some 2,000 of these. Present requirements may be partly replacement of unserviceable weapons and partly for equipment of armed police. 4. We have recently supplied Bren guns of British pattern and I understand B.R.N.O. factory are contemplating protest that this is a breach of terms of licence to manufacturers. Prefix grant.

A statement showing the cost of the stores referred to in the lists *A* and^* attached to the above letter together with the connected vouchers is placed below for perusal and onward transmission to the M.A.G., New Delhi, for carrying out necessaxy adjustment. 2. It will be observed that the cost of the stores actually works out to Rs.56 . 25,2B&amp; as against the estimated cost of Rs.51,08,246. The difference is mainly due to the fact that the original costing was done on the basis of incomplete nomenclature of stores furnished to us for certain items, in this connection it is particularly mentioned that in the case of L.M.G., V*B*, and OLfles No.l although no mention was made about the connected stores in the original list they have now been actually issied and have, therefore, considerably increased the cost. In the case of certain other items, stores of different types and patterns have actually been issued and hence the variations in cost. 3. in order to stfoid such variations and any confusion, it is suggested that Lists ,T B rt and attached to GHQ letter, referred to kaareery above, should, now be revised to indicate the full nomenclature and type of each store to enable us to vo rk out the correct estimated cost before the stores axe issued to Afghanistan Government, in this connection please also see G.S .Branch No.3515/64/1V/D$E-5, dated the 19th March 1945. It will be observed that the nomenclatures of store a now proposed to be issued are different from those shown in the original list.

Subject to anything the War Office have to say I see no objection to the modification of the Govern ment of India’s original proposal on the lines indicated. As I see it, the only change is that 284.9 lakhs should be substituted for the figure of 250*5 lakhs mentioned in my letter to you of the 12th January; and since we are to get 65 $ of the higher figure as and when the stores are issued, we need not worry about this. I am copying this letter to Charlton and Baker. Yours sincerely. E. P.Donaldson, Esq., India Office.The financial proposals put forward by the Treasury are as follows:- (gW ft. Jf/OW.CTO (1 ) equipment totalling in nominal valu^«si»#*4&gt;^ ll,fc y^WB to be sold on credit to the Afghan Government by the Government of India at half nominal value, payment to be made by instalments over 10 years; (2) the cost of writing down to be borne as to 70 ;q by H.M.G. and as to 30/o by the Government of India; (3) risk of default to be borne entirely by the Government of India, The Government of India have found it neces sary to revise the previous valuation of material already delivered 'upwards Ito the exten t of s ome 10'bt They expect that a similar rectification will be required in the case of future deliveries. To avoid subsequent argument and misunderstandings with the Afghan Government it is suggested that the nominal value of these items should be increased by They explain that both the detailed increase in the valuation of the items already delivered and the block increase in the case of items for future delivery are caused only by the incomplete nomenclature of certain items in these lists, which took no account of 'connected stores” issued in accordance with normal practice but not specifically mentioned in wt original, lists. The effect of these proposals is to bring the total nominal value of all equipment on the existing lists to about Rs.28,2+87,500, against the previous estimate of Rs, 2ff, 000,000, Another effect is to increase the nominal loss to be borne by the Treasury in writing down these items. The first sentence of paragraph 2 of the Government of India's telegram is not altogether clear. The stipulation about the condition of the equipment to be handed over to the Afghans is presumably intended to guard against the possibility that the Government of India might find no surplus equipment in their charge suitable to be offered to the Afghans at the price which they are to be asked to pay. What the intentions of the Government of India are in that eventuality is not stated. They iwAi^presumably have to choose between offering such equipment at a lower price than that now contemplated, dividing the cost of this operation in similar proportions between H.M.G. and themselves to those proposed for the major writing-down process; or to secure replacements from this country on a separate financial basis. It does not seem necessary to draw the attention of the Treasury to this, and a draft letter, informing them of the Government of India's acceptance of their proposals, and asking for their concurrence in the proposed re-valuation of the lists, is submitted.

Draft telegram to Government of India transmitting Treasury proposal.PEF Please see telegram of the 21st January to India flag ’’A” setting out the position to date of the negotiations with the Treasury for acceptance by them of a share in the cost of supplying the Afghans with military equipment at favourable rates. The question of underwriting any losses due to an Afghan default in their instalment payments was taken up with the Treasury in Mr. Donaldson's letter of the 30th January and they have now replied. We can accept the Treasury statement that they have never canmitted themselves to share the cost of assistance to Afghanistan, whether on a 50:50 basis or on any other basis. Their reluctance to participate in the underwriting of the loan to Afghanistan (for the goods are to be supplied on the instalment system) is I think understandable and their offer to accept only 65$ of the nominal value of the stores in final settlament of their part of the transaction seems to be a reasonable compromise. To put it in another way, it means that the Treasury are prepared to bear 70^ of the loss resultant on the scaling down of the sale price of the stores to Afghanistan, leaving India to bear only 30% of that loss, assuming that Afghanistan does not default in any of her instalment repayments. It is proposed to put this suggestion to the G-overnment of India and to authorise them to instruct H.M.Minister, Kabul, to proceed on this basis if the Government accept the Treasury offer.

Thank you for your letter of 30th January about the suiDply of military equipment to Afghanistan. I do not think we would necessarily accept your statement that we have, up .to the present regarded the maintenance.of the stability of Afghanistan as ,f as much an Imperial as an Indian interest !f - or, at any rate, the implication that we have been prepared to take an equal share with India in the financial consequences of this 'interestadmit that, in OTOOO gift w the particular case of the mooted in 1941 (and which, materialise), we agreed to the Government of India. I thin^never accepted any as regards expenditure 530CT,000 gift which was incidentally, did not share the cost 30:30 with Gut, by and large, we have specific general commitment on Afghanistan which cannot Fund; ail v r e have said (vide be met from the Afghan our official letter of 22nd Hay, 1936) is the following:~ 'If in future expenditure which could not be'met from this Fund were required,on some object of policy in relation to Afghanistan which both II.E.G-. and the Government of India agreed was desirable, Ey Lords Would be prepared to discuss its incidence and, if satisfied as to the necessity for the proposed expenditure, would consider the making of a contribution from Imperial funds towards such expenditure as could not be defrayed from the Fund'. E.P. Donaldson, Esq, , /We India Office.r* ’inf G.i We have already agreed to such a contribution in the present case, by accepting the proposal that we should share equally with the Government of India the cost of writing down the value of the equipment by 5Q'i. As indicated in my letter of 12th January, we do not wish/to participate in a 10 year loan to Afghanistan free of interest, or to share in the risk of a loss due to default.j/mOur view is that this part of the transaction /fs entirely for the Government of India^/who will after all be responsible for the'negotiations. If your feeling is that this leaves the Government of India to bear too much of the burden, we have an alternative to suggest. But, before I come to this, perhaps I might summarise the difference between us at the moment on the following lines:- (i) Under the Government of India proposal, we would presumably receive a credit for 5Op of the value of the stores as they were issued (25A for India’s share in the cost of writing down their value, and 25m fo? India’s share of the 10 year loan), and a further 25% spread over 10 years as Afghanistan made payments. (ii) Under our proposal, we would receive a credit for 75% of the value of the stores as they were issued, and India would take all the Afghan payments. There is therefore not so very much between us What I now suggest is this. Instead of /creditingcrediting us with 75, : of value when the stores are issued, India should give us only 65 .&gt; in final settlement of our part of the deal; since the bulk of the stores will not require replacement, we would be content with a disposal at this figure. India will then offer the supplies to Afghanistan on the ^ lines proposed, and take all the payments in due ' ourse, so that unless there is default her final contribution to the cost will be only' 15 /-* Perhaps you would put this proposition to the G-overnment of India. Yours sincerely, P.8. Since drafting the above, I have received Cleary’s letter of 23rd February (Ext.1337/46) asking whether the Minister in Kabul may now inform the Afghan Government that they will only have to pay 50,. for military supplies. You will now be communicating our new proposal to the Government of India, and if they are''prepared to accept it the way is clear for the i inister to go ahead.Whitehall 94^0 % THE WAR OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 57/lndia V9142(F.l) ■t y.

L .Fetch j&amp;sq. * Treasury Chaiabers* Great Georpe Street* S.W.1.Please refer to previous minutes on Ext. 3710/4-5• r There has been.much delay in this matter, owing to the insistence of the Treasury on receiving an estimate of the amount of replacements required by India after fulfilling the Afghan demand. This has now been provided (and proved to be of trifling importance), and the Treasury, while ready to agree to the proposal for writing down the value oi the equipment by 50 / and sharing the cost of this process equally with the^ G-overnment of India, are reluctant to underwrite uhe credit jointly with the Government of India, apparently out of distaste for the ten-year period of repayment. It is submitted that this departure from a long established practice requires at the least more justification than is given in the Treasury letter before it can be put to India. There does not seem to be any objection to suggesting a reduction in the period of repayment; the Afghans originally asked for twenty years to pay back Rs. 2 o 0 lakhs, and under present arrangements are to have ten years, to pay back half that amount, so that there may well be room for modification without seriously straining the Afghan economy. It would of course be unfortunate if the effect 01 such modification were to diminish the excellent impression which has been created in Afghanistan by the Government of India's attitude over this equipment, and there is the further point that if the change in the Premiership which is anticipated takes place, any stiffening of the terms may be interpreted as betraying lack of confidence in the new administration. But we may leave these points for the Government of India to raise. A draft demi-official letter to the Treasury, enclosing a draft telegram to the Government of India is submitted.

Dear Donaldson, GREAT GEORGE STREET, LONDON, S.W.l. 12 th January, 1946 b\ Thank you for your letter of 19th December about the supply of m ilitary equipment t o Afghanistan. I gather from Colonel Forster’s letter of 13th November that equipment to the value of 51.7 lakhs has already been issued, or is in process of being issued, and that none of this has had to be replaced. The equipment not yet called forward by the Afghans is valued at 198.8 lakhs (bringing the total to 250.5 lakhs), and of this only those items listed in paragraph 9 of his letter (which total only 21.8 lakhs) may require replacement. This being so, I think we can view the whole transaction on the basis that the Afghans are being supplied from surpluses; and there is the further point, mentioned in paragraph 7 of Colonel Forster’s letter, that not all the equipment is new. We can, therefore, rest content with a 75/3 recovery of the cost of these supplies, which is what ■‘+ he Government of India’s proposal amounts to, and the ay is now clear for you to inform them accordingly. 5 37/0 Government of India telegram I\o. 6689 of 50th July ndicates that it is proposed to spread repayment by he Afghans over 10 years, free of interest, and also uggests that II.M.

The position was explained by Bhig. Antrobus in his letter to you of 29 th August, 1945&gt; which I think you must have overlooked, wherein he stated agreement had been reached with Grist that any Defence Supplies made over to the Afghans would be credited to H.M.G. under the Defence Expenditure plan, and that in consequence a telegram had then been sent by War Office to 0. in C., India on i 6 Mar, 45 (No* 77028/p.i) stating that financial arrangements wer the responsibility of Government of India.

I discussed the matter with iBetch and Grist, and agreed orally (a) that War Office had no objection to the stores being offered to the Afghans at 504 of the cost price provided the Government of India bears one half of the cost of the reduction, i.e. that H.M.G. gets of* the cost price of the stores and (b) that the joint underwriting by H.M.G. and the Government of India of ary losses due to default by the Afghan Government., would so far as H.M.G. is concerned be a matter for the T r easury.

The total value is about Rs. 250 lakhs against the Rs.260 lakhs previously estimated - this figure is inclusive of the token offer (which now stands at about Rs. 55 lakhs against Rs. 48.5 lakhs). The proposals and the expenditure involved are substantially unchanged, and, subject to your concurrence theyefere, we propose to write to the Treasury as in the attached draft.

It hes not yet been possible to make any ^proach to the Afghan Government on this subject and further issues of supplies which migit otherwise be made are held up pending a settlement. Although the Kfesnar situation is quiet at the moment and the tension in the Southern Province seems easier, it cannot be said that conditions in these troublesome regions have been entirely stabilized and there is no knowing when there might be a recrudescence of disturbances which might lead the Afghan Government again to ask for urgent help. It is therefore desirable to get this major question s ettled before any further crisis arises. In any case the Afghans are likely to want delivery soon of the balance of the items they ha A selected from the token offer, as they had been given to understand that Everything in that offer was readily available.

Department of the Government of India. i 2.. ^ At a meeting attended by all concerned on 26 Oct, it was agreed that the best method of clarifying the situation was to cancel all previous lists and classifications of the phased requirements the AFGHAN Government and to draw up a comprehensive statement riving :.he position up to date. 5. In accordance with the above agreement, it has been decided uo draw up new lists of the stores either issued, or required by the AFGHAN Government as a ion'g term project. These new lists are as under List A - Items issued and under issue against the token offer contained in our signal Nu. 9419 of 8 ih/v .1344 and sanctioned by Whir Office in their signal No. 53578^IMAB of 21 Dec 1944. One carrier wheeled is under issue for test in lieu of one carrier tracked. List B - Items included in token offer as above but not yet called forward by AFGHAN Government. It is that these items will still be required. like. List C List D Items issued against the Immediate Demand for operations in KUNAR VALLEY. These items are not included in the original token offer. LMAB sanction for issue of these items has however been received vide Secretary of State telegram No. 24925 dated 11 Nov 1945. Is the list of equipment which the AFGHAN Govt have intimated that they would like as a long tern- project. No issues have been made against this list, and no issues will be made until the financial arrangements are completed, and until HlAB give their sanction to the issues being made. It is proposed to use the above lists for reference in all uture correspondence on this subject, and it is requested that you will do the same. / It will be notedIt will be noted that issues made up to date and items nn&lt;iiA if sue vide List A and List C total approximately 51^- lakhs, which exceeds the limit of financial sanction of 48£ lakhs. This is due to the fact that the cost of connected equipment was not taken into account at the time issue of major items was made. No further tissues will, therefore, be made until further financial cover is jranted. 4 . . ea °h above lists the price quoted is the full payment issue rate excluding customs duty and makes no allowance for ^he fact that a considerable amount of. the equipment provided was NOT brand new, though it was serviced up to Class A condition. This factor should be taken into consideration when the question of writing down the total value of issues is under review, V As regards the question of recoupment of India stocks for l$sues already pade ? it is considered that, in view of the ccssati^K of hostilities^ recoupment is not now necessary. 1- If, however, the AFGHAN Govt require issues to be made gainst List B and List D in the near future before our stock situa tion of controlled stores has improved as a result of demobilizatire'. U* is probable that, in the case of the following short supply Urem-s recoupment will be necessary!- 3 n Mortars 2 ' Mortars LMGs Bren MMGs Vickers Binoculars No .2 IPs, In this connection it is not anticipated that any appreci#^r&amp;~ tanefit will be derived from the re servicing of short supply items thrown up by demobilization within the next 9 months owing to the Vact that initial disbandments cover few, if any, units who hold iaese items, ll. It is not proposed to issue either Light Tanks or Armd }S all holdings of the former are of U.S. origin and stocks of the latter are all required for Armd Corps units in this theatre, 12., At the above meeting M.A.KABUL stated that the AFGHAN Govt may have a long term requirement for 16 to 20 x 25pdr gun/hows and 48 x 3*7 hows, and where enquiring about likely availability of pert worn guns of these types. Long term requirements of this type which are not firm raise a problem in that if a demand is placed after 12 months INDIA and also U.K. may rot be in a position to make th£ issue ? unless such demands are taken into account before war surplu Are finally disposed of.

Consequently the purchase of such types would only exoite the suspicions of the Russians. When the long contemplated re-organisation of the Army had been effected, they would require a number of modem artillery weapons to replace obsolete guns of Kabul manufacture with which their ArtilleryUnit's in the Northern Provinces are at present entirely equipad, in order to avoid giving offence to the Russians. Extensive replacements will also be required in other Provinces, except Herat. General Uraa^mentioned 3.7' 1 mountain guns and 25 pdr. gun howitzer; the number was as yet uncertain, depending on the re-organisation of the Army and the availability of 3 M mortars as substitutes. Colonel Lancaster thinks that the approach was made now/because^ with the end of the War; the Afghan Government are anxious to purchase some secondhand artillery before they are scrapped, since in view of the tribal situation in the Eastern Province, they are hardly in a position to carry out their re organisation plans at present. Nevertheless they have, as General Uma* pointed out*^ taken the necessary first step by sending 20 officers to India for training in the artillery weapons for which he is enquiring. : ^ ' ’ ' - Y/j^Staff. for information r &gt; &gt; G • ; • • ' ‘ If 7-FILE COPY % m- BRITISH LEGATION, KABUL.

Sxt ,4217/45 -u. 0 n Subject : i.vjiitary Training for Afghan Officers and N.G.Os. in India, The attached papers give details of the training required for the 110 Afghan subalterns and 40 N.G.Os whom their Govern ment have decided to send to India. As far as the layman can comment, the arrange ments appear to be sensible, and doubtless owe much to Colonel Lancaster^ guiding hand. There appears every reasoh to hope that the most promising young subalterns will be chosen for these Courses without excessive consideration of family. The intention is presumably to provide small but adequate cadres of instructors in all branches of military science. The language difficulty should not be insuperable, as all the men selected will be Pushtu-speaking, and a not inconsiderable proportion will also speak English. The Afghan General Staff are now anxious to improve instruction in English in their military educational establishments, by obtaining teachers from this country and India /\t itllt t If India. We shall doubtless hear more of this. Colonel Lancaster remarks that the willingness of the Afghan- Gcv'ern- ment to e'dtlhist their best subalterns and N.C.Os to the Government of India for long-term Courses marks a great advance in the friendliness of Anglo- Afghan relations. As Major Crichton remarks, t^ie results of tkese Courses should be of inestimable benefit, both in the political and military sphere, and it is to be hoped that the Government of India v/ill be able to accept the proposal to take the students free of cost to the Afghan Government, as otherwise the whole scheme may still fall through. They will, of course, ■bfc the more ready to do so if the Treasury agree to accept a moiety of the cost involved in writing down the value of the equipment to be supplied to the Afghan Government. r~ n l/f r ^ A Y/ar Staff ^ ^ Financial Secretary (Mf.G^si&gt;) for inforaat^on.^' cjir ^ /fco CsfitoL &amp; ot' 'UJi uKXX Cchw- A&amp;axxJUvmQ . fiO&amp;r UZU ^ •ivG A^jUvMQ . lOc^OvOC &amp; eoWt^C ClIJLE .COPY y* D.O.No.854/45 vV' U-IX&amp; &amp; Id d ''V } ! i Dear 0aroe, of the lith Au, SECRET# KmP * t O'- British Legation, Kabul. 16th August 1945.

I should be glad to know the position. The training of these men and of others who will follow, if the way is made easy, is likely to create such a revol utionary change in our favour in this country that I personally feel that on a long view it wouid pay us to be as generous as possible in this matter also. The contacts these men will make with British and Indian officers in India and the favourable imp ressions they will, it is legitimate to hope, bring back with them of British military power and efficiency and of British goodwill towards Afghanistan, cannot but help contribute towards the creation of a solid core of Afghan friendship and respect for ourselves. The success of the Afghan Military Mission to India did much to prove this. The successful training of some hundreds of Afghan officers and men in India may well hitch the Afghan waggon definitely to the British star. 3.

I am not quite clear as to wliat you are asking me to give our views on,but as you refer to the Treasury wanting to know them I presume that you are asking what the War Office think of the financial proposals which include writing down the cost by 50 /b and spreading repayment over 10 years. I am at once passing the papers to our finance people and will get their views for you. As regards the last paragraph of your letter I am sorry you have not seen the subsequent telegrams, conies of which were sent to Colonel Craddock and Brigadier Reynolds. Charlton had some correspondence with Grist on the subject of the finance of the token issues from which it emerged that the value of any De fence Supplies made over to the Afghans would be credited to the Defence Services estimates and steps .were being taken -to ensure that H, M. G. would-be duly credited through the plan. In consequence we followed up the ^ telegram of 21st December 1944 with llo. 77028 (F.l) *of 16 March 1945 saying that the financial arrangements were, the responsibility of the Government of India.

It is essential,however, that we should know at once what stores it is proposed to supply to Afghanistan, since I cannot trace that we have any details beyond those of the original token Issues. I suggest therefore that, unless you already have them, you cable India for-these details concurrently with discussing the financial proposals.

The Government of India 1 s proposal means that we shall recover 75 per cent, of the value of this equipment.

It may be that you will not be able to clear up this point without reference to the Government of India; we would, however, like to know what the answer is before deciding whether or not to agree to the Government of India 1 s proposals. We would also like to have the views of the Foreign Office and the War Office (and possibly the Ministry of Supply) on the matter; you have sent a copy of your letter to Pyman, and I would suggest you might do the same as regards the other two Departments.

The Government of India now consider/ it necessary, having regard to the Afghan internal situation, to make available to the Afghan Government immediately a part or the whole of^the urgent list. No comment on their action from this aspect seems to be necessary, as the London Munitions Assignment Board have already agreed in principle (see telegrams flagged A and B on collection 7/47). In paragraphs 3 to 5 of their telegram, however, the Government of India make certain proposals for writing down the value of the whole of the equipment to be supplied, in view of the presumption that the bulk of it will be delivered at a time when, with the cessation of hostilities, the stock will be surplus. (it was the original intention to finance the credit for the urgent list from the Afghan Fund, but this would have been insufficient to meet the additional cost of the second list, and we have never heard what the Government of India's intentions were in this respect). The cost of writing down the equipment is estimated at a million pounds, and it is proposed that this should be borne equally by Indian and Imperial Revenues. The Government of India contend that this matter concerns the security, not only of India as a whole,but of British Imperial interests in Asia generally. It is relevant in this connection that the Treasury agreed in 1936, when the Afghan Fund was institutedJ^if in future expenditure which could not be met from this Fund were required on some object of policy in relation to Afghanistan which both His Majesty's Government and the Government of India agreed was desirable, they would be prepared to discuss its incidence, and, if satisfied as to the necessity for the proposed expenditure, would/oo rnit-t- the making of a contribution from Imperial funds towards such expenditure as could not be defrayed from the Fund. Furthermore, when, in 1944 the question of a gift of £500,000 to the Afghan Government was under con sideration. the Treasury agreed that a moiety might reasonably be charged to Imperial Revenues. It is submitted that the most expeditious method of reaching an agreement on the subject would be to hold a meeting with the Departments concerned, and demi-official letters to the Foreign Office and the Treasury are attached accordingly.

Colin* 7/47 )• It has also been agreed that the equipment should be supplied at different dates, (a) a token supply now and (b) a larger consignment at the end of the Japanese war* As regards paragraph 2, the Government of India are speeding up the supply of (a) without waiting on agreement as to the financial settlement. I do not think we need object to this although in view of recent telegrams which have reported that the Eastern Province situation is now under control, we are at a loss to understand what is meant by 'threatening situation”. As regards paragraphs 3 to 5 of the telegram, the Government of India’s point in paragraph 3 is a little provocative and I do not think it is a good argument to use with the Treasury. Paragraph 4 suggests that 20 years is too long a period over which to spread instalments. With this, no doubt, everyone will agree. The alternative would oe to ask for an initial lump sum payment and die rest in instalment# ever a shorter period ; as was done in the case of the sale of British aircraft to the Afghans before the war. The Afghan Government, however, wish to spend their capital on economic development! and are adverse to this method, I believe. With regard to the second point in paragraph 4 of cutting the price, there will be an immense amount of surplus equipment as soon ^ as the Far Eastern war ends and prices are bound to fall considerably* to obtain half price does not seem unreasonable. Mr. Grist will be able to comment on the possibilities of obtaining Treasury consent to Imperial Revenues standing half'the cut in the price. Ferris has quoted in his minutes may .-nnirn jffTiiii itiW U1 iltf 1 gulnts with the Treasury. The offer of half a million sterling to the Afghans in 1941 was never accepted. Mr. Grist may like to see Mr. Cleary’s scribbled notes attached, which he sent in while on leave after having seen a copy of the J telegram. b sM - I concur with the draft letter and am prepared to attend the meeting. I agree that at this stage we are only concerned with the financial proposals, which I feel should be strongly supported. As the principle of supplying military equipment has been agreed to by the Y/ar Office, and they are not concerned in the financial side, I do not think they require to be represented. 4.8.45. If the equipment to be supplied to the Afghans is likely to be surplus to our requirements at the time of supply, the Governnent of India’s proposal that H.M.G. should in effect be paid three-quarters of its cost price, is a very favourable one to H.M.G. I cannot imagine that they will get anything like this figure for their surplus military equipment overall. Indeed the Government of India have only offered 50/ of the cost of factory expansions/' * ’—— — expansions and these ou^at to have a better post-war value than aims and equipment. However, if the G-overmnent of India are willing to go fifty/fifty with in the presimed loss arising from writing down the value of the stores to half cost, I am not disposed to object and their proposal as a whole seems to me to be one which the Treasuiy might reasonably be expected to accept. Indeed I should not have thought it necessary to suggest a conference about it in the first instance. However, if it is thought best to initiate discussions orally I shall be quite prepared to attend, if desired. I agree with Mr. Grist that the Government of India’s proposal ought to secure Treasury concurrence without much difficulty both in view of the previous history of the supply pf arms and munitions to Afghanistan and because of the favourable terms to H.M.G-. on which the supply to the Afghan Government will be made. I therefore substituted a draft demi-official letter to the Treasury asking them to accept the arrangement proposed in the Government of India’s telegram of 30th July, reserving for oral discussion, if the need should arise, any objections which the Treasury or Foreign Office might have to raise.

Government of India telegram No* 6689 of 30th July about the payment for the military equipment to be supplied to -the Afghan Government* We hope that you will be able to accept the arrangement proposed by the Government of India, viz. that the cost of the military equipment should be written do*m by 5Q£ and that the expense of reducing the price to the Afghans should be shared equally between Indian and Imperial revenues, in view of the common concern in the security of Afghanistan. This incidence follows generally the practice applied in previous transactions of this kind in past years and^ since -the equipment/equipment to be supplied to the Afghan i Government is likely to be surplus to requirements at the time of supply^ the proposal strikes us as by no means unfavourable to H.M.G. If you should see any difficulty in accepting the proposal or would wish to have the matter discussed in greater detail, we should be glad to call a meeting of the departments interested; we think however that in any case an early decision should be taken and should be grateful for a fairly quick reply.

On 4th July the Afghan Q*G*S. during the course of a norxsal interview gave me a. short resume* of their lailitary commitments in the Southern and ^astern provinces, and ended by nailing a special request for the immediate delivery of the arms and equipment enumerated in paragraph 4 below. He stated that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs had or would be making a similar appeal to H* M*s. Charge* d’affaires for the early delivery of this war material and that as the need was urgent The Afghan Govt, would ask that the material be delivered at once before final details regarding payment had been settled. 3. ^ The gist of the resume given regarding the tribal situation in the Southern and Eastern provinces and the Govt. *s military commitments is as follows j- * « (a) Southem Province . Tv/o Infantry Bri^ides of the Kabul garrison are at present in the Southern province, one at Almarah in JChoat, and one formerly at Ur gun has now been withdrawn to Gardes because it had too large a number of recruits and untrained men to render the Brigade fit for operations a^iinst tribesman. This latter Brigade has been replaced at Urgun by a Brigade from the 5th Ghazni division. Owing to toe activities of the Ghilzai Malang and M&amp;zrak Aadran it was not possible to withdraw these extra Brigades from the southern province w/ithout incurring some risk. (b) Eastern Province. There had recently been a recrudescence of opposition to the Govt.’s plans for introducing conscription and education amongst the Safis of the Kunar valley and the Khugianis of Gandamak and Kingrahar resulting early in July of attacks on Govt, military and armed police posts in the Kunar valley by the Safis. The Govt, had therefore despatched two more Infantry Brigades to Jalalabad under Lt. Gen. Muhd Baud Khan to reinforce the garrison there, while troops of the 11th Eastern Province Division were being concentrated at Shewa in toe Kunar valley. 4 Hind aircraft had also been sent to Jalalabad with bombs and incendiary bombs. It ms not yet known whether the disturbances in the Chigha Semi - Asmar area in the Kunar valley would subside or whether extensive military operations would be necessary. A great deal depended on the attitude of the Khugianis and the Shinwaris towards toe Govt. One of the Govt.'s chief difficulties was the poor communications with the Kunar valley, the only bridge over the Kabul Giver at the Garunta gorge being unsafe for heavy traffic and unable to take more than unloaded motor cars and lorries. If this bridge became unserviceable the Govt, troops might find themselves on toe North side of the un- f or Gable Kabul River dealing with toe Safis while a i .ore serious outbreak of disturbances occurredPara 3 tb; Con td • Page 2 mvi m 8 outb. oi’ the xCaboX sliver which might ih'texrup't i oa (% cos^iuni cations between Kabul and Torkaam.

The first figure still holds good, but the second is now reduced to Rs.l .85 Crores apioroximately, exclusive of. certain articles, notably light armoured vehicles, for which the price has not yet been ascertained* (see detailed list flagged-at This sum is still of course far beyond the capacity of the Afghan fund in its present condition. The Treasury have recently drawn our attention derni-officially to the (desirability of augmenting... the fund in order that these credits shall not deplete its reserve unduly. VI&amp; The Afghan Government have also decided to send/officers for training in India, a very much larger number than was at first con templated; the figure however is still only about half that for which the Government of India are prepared to offer facilities. Other points of interest which emerge frcm--the present papers are as follows (1) While not^ desiring a full scale Military Air: Mission to Kabul, the Minister of Defence would like Colonel Lancaster and Squadron Leader King, the British Pilot Instructor with the Afghan Air Force, to draw up a scheme of develop ment, and then perhaps to seek expert advice from the R.A.F. (2) In the course of a very interesting conversation with Colons1 Lancaster, Firqa lishar Muhammed Baud Khan, Commander of the Kabul Arny Corps, said that he! aimed at the formation of a smaller, better-equipped and better-trained regular army, on a sound volunteer basis. The difficulty of course was con ditions of service, which in turn were dependent on finance. (3) With regard to foreign assistance, he continued, it was now realised that they must rely solely on Britain and the U.S.A. The Turkish Military Mission was now chiefly maintained for military reasons. The chief problem in this realignment of policy was language, as previously promising officers had chiefly been taught French or German. (4) No further approaches have been made to the Americans, and their Military Attache has stated that it would not be in accordance with their present policy to supply the Afghans with arms and equipment. ( 5 ) The Foreign Minister has once again emphasised the gratitude of his Government for the treatment of the Afghan Military Mission to India. r ar Staff ^ IV Financial Secretaiy , for information. 7?. 1945 O0HLE COS .

X have already reported on this in niy telegram under reference. I askejft that the list should be faired and sent to me officially. This has now been done and I enclose a translation oi the list and of the official communication which accompanied it together with a copy of Col.

You will see that there is a discrepancy between the figure of ha.12f760jOO0 given in my telegram and the total in the official letter which is is.Id,768,386. This is due to the nfghans having miecalculated the price oi certain items, a mistake which has now been corrected. 3. Immediately after I had left the Foreign Office on June 11th Ali kuiiH-rnad telephoned to say that he had forgotten one important item during the course of our discussion. This was that he wished to confirm on behalf oi his Government the conversation^ which had taken place between the Chief of General staff and the British Military Attache on the subject of training facilities which the Afghan Government hoped to secure for 60 of their oilleers.

He eald tlxat the visit of the Afghan Military Mission to India hs.d been a great success, and together ^iththe a p on tone out offer of the Govt of India to supply Afghanistan with a token quantity of up to date arms andequipment. and facilities for training in their use, had convince* many Afg^n army officers who were previously suspicious about the British, that Afghanistan could new look fith some confidence to India and Gt.

Progress ms however slow owing to a lack of volunteers* '(d) hat the officers of the Turkish military ! is?ion had helped aim a great deal in organising military schools and in training officers. He felt that these Turkish officers had no reached the limit of their usefulness, and could not t;v eb Afghan officers the higher branches of strategy tactics and administration* For these^subjects he thought tha.t thty must turn to England or -mcrica tor assistance* His Govt did not intend to replace the rurkiah Military Mission but would eliminate those Turkish officer* Instructors who were no longer of value to %h*M and retain the rewfeinder* The presence of a Turkish Military Mission in WbS ms of value to Afghanistan from a poiatioal point oi view particularly vis-a-vis Hus^ia and xfgh&amp;n public opinion. (e) that the Afghan Govt had at one/time envisaged obtaining all the assistance they required in military and. air form matters from Germany, Fran©© m Italo ; , ^ , encoui^ gad the ©stabHshoient of a French and % German school in KabuJU they realised that this _ ■«&gt;&gt;» s a was take because their young officers had learnt French or German and kno litUe or no English.

I also said that I hoped that they would let us have full information regarding their military require ment s before I went home on leave so that I could discuss the matter in Lomon. He replied that their scheme was almost ready and I an probably now gsing to discuss the whole matter officially with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on Monday* 2. Meanwhile the Military Attache has been having further t Iks on matters of detail and 1 enclose a copy of his latest letter D*0 .No.402/a/MA of the 7th June to the General Staff. The cost of arms required apparently amounts^to the formidable total of £1,110,000 and Lancaster estimates that with ail the ammunition and ancillary equipment which will be necessary, the final amount will probably exceed £2,000,000. This does not induce air force requirements which may cost anything up to a further quarter million. a. JX aa sending copies of this letter and enclosure to Baxter and Cleary.

A dated 2. There have beendevelopments during the past 10 days in ^hich you will be interested. On 2nd June H.R.H. The inister of Defence spoke to II. *3 Minister and stated tint the lists of the Afghan Govt’s requirements in ,rt ^ Utary c ,.,i ^ment would be ready with in tae and mentioned that he required advice concerning the future organisa tion anp training of the Afghan ^ir fpi^ce from the British oilot instructor and the Military ittacne*. ii.u's Minister' has not yet been approached by tiae inister lor Foreign Affairs regarding the financial aspect oi aighan Govt’s proposed purchases of war material* out x iniderstanci that the approach is to be made in the sery near future. There is however }.ittle doubt that the total cost ox the proposed purchases is causing a considerable amount oi concern in Govt circles, and that they are anxious have our reactions to their actual requests for arms eoc, and some indication of how we expect them to pay for the material required, the stress being on long term instalments and lowest possible prices. On 5th June the Afghan Chief ox tae General Staff informed me that he had been given authority to pass on to me further details of their present and future requirements in e.-^uioment etc for cur consideration, and that after the luinistef for Foreign affairs nau me.de a formal approach to H.M’s Minister on the financial aspect of the case, he would hand over to me the complete lists of their requirements. The first list would include what his Govt would like to take from the arms and equipment offered at Delhi in January 1945 and the second would contain their additional requirements. In passing on to rae the information about the war material required by the Afghan Govt, the Chief of the General Staff stressed the following points;- (a&gt; that it would be apparent from the list of arms etc required from British sources that his Govt were catering for internal security and not for any other purpose, (b.) that his Govt did not wish to arouse Russian suspicions by purchas ing anti-tank guns, medium or heavy tanks, anti aircraft guns etc (c) tb&amp;t his Govt were prepared to look to Gt. Britain for the supply of practically all their infantry weapons and equipment and for the training of Afghan officers in their use (d) that the Afghan Govt would rely on us for advice and assistance in connection with their nir Force# My recent discussions with various senior military officers nave left me with the impression that the Ministry of Defence are most anxious to secure the arms and equipment they require as early as possible, while the Afghan Govt are more cautious and wish to go into the financial£•(contd) the financial aspect of the H uestion before they commit them selves to placing firm orders for war material. There are the usual suspicions about Bussia in military circles and a vague idea that both America and aus.ia may supply ^ar material to Persia while Afghanistan will be left to find for herself. There i s therefore a desire to speed up decisions^ and the Chief of the General Staff suggested to me that as frequent visits to the Ministry of Defence by the British Military Attache 1 in uniform might arouse comment in Kabul, it would be better to have the discussions regarding the supply of arms etc alternatively at the Ministry of Defence and the Military Attache*s house in the Legation* The C.G*S* or General Asadullah Khan would come to the Legatipn in mufti for the purpose, ostensibly to have tea and play tennis or see the Legation Surgeon* I have agreed to this procedure being adopted. 3. The following additional details regarding arms and equipment required by the Afghan Govt were given to me by the C.G.S. on 5th June;- (a) 4. £ inch murtars . A total of 56 mortars with complete carrying equipment and 1000 shells per mortar are required. The ty, e to be the American model seen at Ramgarh which is lighter than the British model seen at Saugor. I was asked whether supply could be made from British sources, or whether they should apply to Major Fox U.S.A. Military Attache*. I replied that I would speak to Major Fox as I 'was not certain whether this weapon was or was not, a lease - lend item, and also make en ulries from G.H.Q* India* (b) ^ inch ffiprt&amp;lLS ‘ _ The Afghan Govt accept the 50 mortars offered and require complete carrying equipment for them. 1000 shells per mortar also required. In addition they require 154 more of these Z inch mortars complete with carrying equipment and 1000 shells per mortar. Supply to be made as soon as war conditions permit, or over a period. Total requirements 204 mortars and 204,000 shells including some smoke shells. (c) IL.lnC h . ido Ltarg, The offer of 24 of these mortars with complete carrying equipment is accepted. 1000 shells per mortar including smoke shells will be required. No more 2 inch mortars are required as they are to be used chiefly for training purposes, and this mortar is not considered very suitable for use in Afghanistan.Page 5. (d) MfdQim .. rnchine GviQS-1 Viper s . Z0&amp;) The offer of 6 guns complete with full carrying equipment and spares is accepted* The Afghan Govt require 520 more of these guns, a total of 526, all complete with carrying equipment. Supply to be made as early as possible or over a period* Stress was laid on the necessity for the early supply of a much larger number than 6 of these guns, as the Afghan Army wished to standardize .503 S*A.A* Failing promise of supply within a year or so the matter would have to be reconsidered, and perhaps a different calibre gun purchased from some other foreign source. 20,000 rouncis of .503 S.A.A. per gun will be required. (e) ,aus Bren Light Siacnlne Gun. The offer of 100 guns complete with carrying equipment and spares is accepted* 10,000 rounds of S.A.A. per gun required. For comments see (f) below. (f) ,*505 _VIg kex-S_Blkrl,hier Light .Machine Gun. The offer of 1500 guns complete with carrying equip ment ana spares is accepted. 10,000 rounds of S.A.A. per gun required. The Afghan Govt require a total of 2,200 Light Machine Guns complete with spares and carrying equipment and 10,000 rounds S.A.A. per gun. Supply to be made as early as possible or over a period of about one year. They would like the whole 2,200 to be .303 Bren L.M. Gs if available, or failing that would consider taking 2,200 Vickers Berthier L.M.Gs should they be available in the near future. They would prefer to standardize the type in use i n their army. Mention was also made of a desire to purchase some tripods for the Light Machine Guns for firing the guns on fixed lines at night and for indirect fire. These tripods to be used in the interim period or until such time as the supply of medium machine guns could be arranged. (g) 0 mm Sten Machine Carbine. Some probably required, but decision will only be reached after testing out the sample machine carbine supplied at the end of May. (h) .dOS Ellies. The offer of 2000 rifles accepted, and 1000 rounds S.A.A. per rifle required. The Afghan Govt require 50,000 .303 rifles over a period of about 2 years, and hope that 20,000 to 25,000 or more can be supplied in the near future, and the remainder later on. It was3• (h) contd* It was seated that almost the whole of the a armed police are armed with obsolete Martini Henry and .Manser rifles which are now useless f and that it was intended to withdraw these and issue some of the older types of .303 rifle now in the possession of the army to the armed police. The army would then be issued with new rifles. &gt;any thousands of the .303 rifles now in use by the army are unserviceable and require replacement. &gt;ome rough estimates of the Afghan Gov^s requirements in rifles have been made 1m my half yearly reports on the Afghan Army. 'tinea. Hone of the 2000 offered are required at present but a few for training purposes may be required later. Cjl Ou j m&lt;n, # i'he scale on which the Afghan Govt propose to ask for the supply of S.Awv. is as follows;- (i) nifles - 1000 rounds per rifle supplied. (ii; L.M. Guns - 1000 rounds per gun supplied. (lii) medium machine Guns - 20j000 pounds per gun supplied. - a1 ^ 0 be an additional request for the supply oi .jjS d.i,.A. for rifles already in the country, xu ,.to be by instalments in each case owing to the ditlxculty of storage and possible deterioration through storage over a period. ^ ^ , fi' wa3 admitted that or grounds of expense the Afghan urovt coula not at present afford to expend more tfian 20 to 30 + h^rL° f man ? er year for purposes, but bo P aa J' 0 he able to increase this allowance in future, interesting side-light on the question of .303 S .A *A. supplies was a statement that the Afghan Govt would like a ^ m11 P lant in Kabul for the manu- •f 03 with machinery supplied by Gt. Britain or India* ine reasons given were that Afghanistan must be in a position to mnufacture her own .303 3ftirsufficient consumption.

(l) The Afghan Govt will accept all the equipment offered, except possibly the 1000 telephone sets type D*5 A reduced number may be taken as at the resent time they have not sufficient trained operators to work the tele hone sets, (ii) In addition they require 530 helios with tripods» size 10 to 15 cm diameter. Also 140 helios with tripods* size 20 to 25 cm diameter. These helios are required for' issue to signallers in army units and formations and I have been asked whether these can be supplied by India. (m) hmuly InQ^pih^ h , uipment.. There will be a moderate demand for some of this equipment and details will be supplied later. (n) Artillery haui.oment. (i) No anti tank or anti aircraft guns are required at present as the Afghan Govt do not wish*to upset Bussia by purchasing them. (ii) No 25 Pounder Field Guns or 3.7 inch Howitzers are required at present, because they are expensive. The Afghan Govt, do however wish to have officers trained in India in these weapons, and it was stated that later on they might purchase some of these guns and howitzers e* ©daily when the vehicles to haul the 25 pounder guns became available. I have a vague suspicion not yet confirmed by any independent report, that the Afghan Govt are playing the Russians in respect of the supply of artillery from Russia in order to keep the Russians happy about their other proposed purchases in India should they by chance hear of them. This c.ction xS a norm..! one ior the Afghan Govt, and has been taken on previous occas^ions. ^ l ere. Armoured Cars and Tanks * (i) The Afghan Govt consider that the TracfciCarriers offered are very expensive, and though they are extremely useful in open country, the erevgg of the carriers are exposed to fire irom the hills owing to the absence of armour on the top of the carriers. They would like to purchase one as a sample and try the carrier out in Kabul. An enquiry was made as to whether this type of carrier could be fitted with bullet proox top armour to give protection to the crew in hilly country. ' 7 (ii) The Afghan Govt wish to purchase six armoured cars of the Daimler or other suitable ty e seen by the Military Mission at Ahaadnagar. This Is a new departure as the officers 01 the Military Mission old not display much Interest in armoured cars when on tour In India, a request wa c for details prices and specifications of armoured^carsfPara 3 Co) Contd* Page 6 2jo (iii) the Afghan Govt do not wish to purchase any medium or heavy tanks, and would like to avoid even the purchase of the Stuart Light Tank seen at Ahmadnagar as they feel 'that such a purchase may upset the Russians. ' hat they really require is a bullet proof tankette suitable for use on internal security duties and for operations against tribesmen. The weight not to exceed 5 or 6 tons. Their Fiat Ansaldo C.V* 10 tanks had proved most useful in operations around Matun against tribesmen in the spring of 1944. They require 24 of these Light Tanks or Tankettes, and have asked whether we will provide them with prices and specifications of this type of armoured vehicle, and say when 24 could be made available for sale to them. Failing the supply of this type they would have to reconsider the purchase of the Stuart Light Tank which has a weight of approximately 13 tons and is too heavy for use on Afghan roads and bridges. (P) motor u.vcles. The Afghan Govt wish to purchase 20 motor cycles for use by army despatch riders, and have asked to be supplied with prices and specifications and wish to know whether they can be made available for sale to them. MisfisU-iaXteo us.. j.;.;-:. uipiaen-U (i) Binoc^la.rs Mo. 2 . The Afghan Govt accept the 50 pairs offered to them and require 500 more pairs as soon as they can be made available. (ii) Prisfra tic Compasses No. 9. The offer of 24 compasses is accepted and 300 more compasses are required as soon as the supply situation permits. (iii) Bange inders Ho. i2. The offer of three range finders is accepted and details of their further requirements will be given later. Requirements will depend on the number of Light and Medium Machine Guns supplied. (iv) Flares. In the first instance the Afghan Govt require samples of 20 to 24 of all types of flares in use for training purposes. In addition in order to be able to use the flares they require a number of /axy Pistols, and have asked for the prices specifications and availability for shle of any types o Very Pistol in use by us. &lt;r)-ara 3 Jontd, iv) ^aouisies, The Chief of the General Staff stated that they were interested in a number of other items of military equipment} those mentioned being:- (i) Saddlery of various kinds for carrying medium and light machine guns on mules or ponies* (ii) Haver sacks. Packs and Belts of a soldiers* web eouipment, but the pattern of equipment must necessarily be of a* different pattern to that of the British and Indian armies. Uii) equipment for 100, 300 and 500 bed hospitals Hygiene Sections, sanitary Sections and anti malarial unite. Further details of the Afghan Govt* a re 4 uir^ents will be given to me within the next week or two. 4* The Chief of the Afghan General Staff confirmed that his Govt wish to despatch some 60 Afghan army offi cers to India for jminfo g if possible during' the autumn of this year. Details ox tile number to be sent on eacn course will be given to me in the near future. The courses of training to which they will be sent are approximately those given in paragraph 6 of my j/0 let ter No. ^OZ/k/NA dated 24th , ay 1945. The Afghan Govt are still perturbed about the probable cost of maintaining 50 officers in India while under training, and I suggest that to begin with the cost of messing and accommodation should be as low as possible, or even provided ( free of clarge for the first batch of officers sent. 5. Regarding the advice the Afghan Govt wish to have concerning the reorganisation and training of their MjLJElprce, H.R.ii. The finis ter of Defenceand the C.G.3. have since reiterated their desire for our assistance in air force • matters, this being on the lines indicated in paragraph 7 of my D/0 letter No. 402 /AAa da te d 24th ^lay 1945. I am therefore preparing in conjunction with Squadron Leader B.h. King, A.F.C. pilot instructor in the Afghan Air Force some suggestions for improving the efficiency of the air force for the informtion of H.h's minister in the first instance who will probably consult external Affairs Department, Govt of India before the suggestions are passed on to the Afghan military authorities. The J.G.3. infomed me on 5th dune that the cost of maintaining their air force during the war years 1940 to 1945 when full economy was being exaercised was R 8 to A 10 million Afghani per year. He gave no indication of what his Govt were prepared to spend on the purchase of ne w aircraft and equipment, though hints were given that they would like to buy 8 t o 12 trai ner aircraft of t heJTig er Moth type* 24 to 36 operational aircraft,f ^ara 5 Contd&gt; i'age 8. 8 aircraft : 4 or 5 passengers and mail* Definite dscTs ionl re garbling the purchase of aircraft v»ill not he made until the Afgiian Govt Ikave studied trie suggestions being made by Squadron Leader ^xng* G. I shall be grateful if you will let me have your views on the information given in paragraph 3 above, togetiier with some indication of the replies I am to give to the Afghan Ministry of Defence in respect of their increased requests for arms and eouipment etc, and to the other enquiries they have made. ^ am afraid that these Afghan requests and enquiries may be very tiresome and mean a of additional work for you. i feel however that It is better to explain these developments as they occur, so that you^oe in the picture when firm requests are made by the fghan Govt. 7. u.ids minister is forwarding a copy of this letter to external Affairs Department, Govt of xndia, and to the Foreign office and India Office, London for tneir informtion. .tOUrS •‘s '5 -»•«£, 1 \r Brig.

I think Russian suspicions would undoubtedly/be aroused if free gift were to include armaments and ammuni/tion and this was principal reason why I did not recommend operational equipment, vide my express letter 683/44 Jtiay 18th, paragraph No.3. Free gift cf training equipment such as Tiger Moth cr hospital requirements is not likely to cause unfavourable reactions. 2. Afghans are alive to the possibility of Russian objections and are therefore prepared if necessary to a sk Russia also to supply some of their requirements such as artillery. 1 think therefore that they would rather welcome a free gift from us as this would give them grounds for suggesting similar present from Russians: but from cur point of view competition of this nature would be most undesirable. 3- If Government of India are prepared to make a gift (?tc) Afghanistan it should in my opinion take the form of free training in India including messing and other expenses of Afghan students. Latest indications are that Afghans would like to send between 150 and 170 students for various courses but are hesitating on account of very high cost by Afghan standards. Offer of free training together with equipment involved in such training such as wireless sets, binoculars, compasses, etc*, would in my opinion be best form cf direct assistance.

The telegram has been repeated to the Government of India and no doubt we will receive their views in due course. , We have already approved the proposal in ^ S6e OUr tele S ram 29343 dated 28th December: Ext. 5o4o/ 44} and I am not sure that the financial details concern us very much. t We were told in the Government of India*s telegram 2956 of the 28th March (Ext. 1484^45) that the approximate value of the token supplies indicated in an ^aide-memoire handed to the Afghan Mission amounted to Rs. 68 lakhs. The present requirements of the Afghan Government amount only to approximately Rs.48*5 lakhs. The Military Attache expects that their Cv I^ter demands may however be stepped up to something like R s. 26*-*-LaJdis. If this turns out to be the case the Afghan Fund will have to be considerably augmented in order to bear the unitial incidence of the cost until such time as the Afghans are able to repay the Government of India. Mr.Squire thinks that the Afghans can be persuaded to reduce the period of repayment but he has asked for instructions before making any counter proposals.

Muhd Daud Khan G*O.C-in~C of the Kabul Army Corps, and Najibuliah Khan, the Director General of the Political Section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs regarding the Afghan Govt's desires in respect of the token offer to supply certain arms and equipment to them, and of iiie offer to give facilities for training Afghan army officers in India, made to the Afghan Military Mission at Wow Delhi in January 1345. dee Appendix 'D' of the report on the visit of the Afghan Military Mission to India forwarded under my D/0 letter No* 402/:.&gt; dated 15th Liarch 1945. They stated tixa,t firm recuests fox the supply of 3.rms and equipment, and the training' of Afghan officers in India would be made as soon as the Minister fox Foreign Affairs had ciscussed with H.m's Minister the financial aspect of the problem• It was apparent that they hoped they would be able to pay for any war material supplied by instalments, ana that the probable cost of training Afghan officers in India was causing them some anxiety. They also expressed a desire for advice from the British pilot instructor and the Military Attache 1 regarding the future organisation, equipment and training of the Afghan Air Force, and intimated that A.n.n. The Minister of Defence proposed to discuss with H.M's Minister and, the Military Attache' the various problems connected with the air Force including the purchase of trainer and operational aircraft, and the training of Afghan airforce personnel in India. 3. On 22nd may the Chief of the General Staff informed me that he was now able to give me some details about Hie arms and equipment his Govt proposed to buy from the Govt of India and concerning which a more formal approach is to be made to H.M's Minister. Two lists of their requirements have been prepared, one relating to the token o'ffer of arms and equipment made to trie Afghan Military Mission while in India, the supply of which can be effected immediately and the other to their long term requirements in war material the supply of which will perhaps only be possible over a period of 1 to 2 years. The arms etc for which requests for supply from British sources are to be made include the following items:- (&amp;) 3 }&gt; Mar tars.* The Afghan Govt would like to take the 50 offered. These are being purchased in lieu of -Hie more expensive artillery weapons, as they consider them eminently suitable for use in defence or attack against tribesmen in the Southern Province and for* other internal security purposes* (b) Medium uacu.aie ^uns (Vickers *303)* Numbers required my be between 700 and 800, and in view of the low number of 6 guns immediately available for supply to them 'the Ministry of Defence have not reached a final decision concerning Lira purchase of tnis type of gun. They would like more of these guns supplied if they can be made available over a period of a year of*so. They hope that we shall be able to meet their requirements in due course* (o)r^ra 3 ContcU -2- (c) msbAm &amp;m&amp;*. The Afghan Govt would like to take the 1500 offered. id) J^ahi ne Carhine (9 The sample 3ten Carbine was handed over to tiie ministry of Defence on 22nd May 1345. The Afghan Govt will decide after /100 examining the carbine how many of the/carbines offered they require* It is probable that they will take the whole offer as they wish to use them for escort duties, and for protecting motor transport convoys. (e) aS,: j2, It ms stated that the offer of 2000 rifles for immediate supply ms quite inadequate to meet their needs, and that they hoped that now the war in 1 or ope was over we could be able *o supply many thousands more of these rifles. 25o actual xrgure of their requirements Vvas given, but 1 anticipate ynat lo.uuu to 20.000 rifles my be required. Upkeep and repair of rifles is notoriously bad in the Afghan army, and mention .vas mde Ox a desire to send armourers to India for training in our Ordnance factories or repair establishments* (f) ^nti-dank mines ana explosives*,. It was stated that the request for the supply of anti-tank mines would be limited to those required for training purposes. No mention was made of Afghan requirements in explosives, out demands will probably consist of moderate quantities for training purposes, for use in the Kabul arsenal and xor road construction etc *303 I was informed that the demand for *303 $.A*a* would depend on the number of *303 rifles, light machine guns and Vickers medium machine guns supplied* The Afghan Govt are aiming at standardizing uhe .303 type of S.A.i,. used throughout the army and the armed police. It is for this reason that the ministry of Defence are'anxious to secure the light and heavy machine guns they require from British sources. Should the Afghan Govt fail to obtain the .303 light and medium macnine guns they require, they isay &amp;s|£ the U*3*A. to supply them with other types. I anticipate a demand of from 10 to 20 million rounds of .303 S.A*A. (h) OicnallfrAC equipment*. The O.G.b* stated tiiat his Govt would accept the whole of the equipment offered. This however did not represent all their requirements, but was most useful to begin with* The Mission had noted some useful types of American Signalling equipment and he hoped what taeii additionobna require as: nts would be met from either British or American sources of supply. U) There would be a moderate demand for this equipment, but the problem was bound up with the advice we give regarding the future organisation, equipment and training of the Afghan Air Force it) It was stated that the Afghan Govt feel that it would be politically inadvisable for them to ask for the supply of expensive anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft guns and tanks other than very light tanks at this juncture, since the Soviet Govt might well enquire why they had bought them, and against whom were these weapons likely to be directed.5 -3-3 w They had decided l^o ash Tor no anti—dank ^uns or ant.i-aix'crait. funs, while the possible purchase of a BJnall nuaber of light t«.mks ms till being considered. ftMUM d . hlhd Paud Khan has asked me to discuss with him the question of training tank crews in India, and stated thav he ^fas thinking of forming one or two squadrons of light tanks for use on internal security duties and for operations against tribevsmen. (ii) Regar ding field and mountain guns I was informed that the Afghan Govt were trying to limit their requests for Tuns to the very miniraun or leave them out ox their calculations altogether for the present. They ’proposed to subs bimrte tne S* 1 and 4.3 fl mor bare for artillery weapons bb far as possible on grounds of expense. They had found the mortars extremely useful in operations against tribesmen particularly tne 4.2 mortar with its longer range. (k) Specifications and a photograph of the tracked carriers have been given to the Ministry of Defence but no decision has yet bean reached regarding the offer of 200 o.i. these carriers. ^ decision is expected within the next few days. Regarding motor lorries it was stated that the Ministry of Defence would continue to obtain their requirements in Chevrolet, dodge and other types of lorries from American sources as it was found that from the n&amp;Int&amp;ftnence point^ of view they were the most economical form of transport for thera. a) The Afghan Govt are prepared to accept the binoculars, compasses and range finders offered and I was informed what a comprehensive list of their further requirements nas been compiled and will be handed to me in due course. It will include a moderate number of flares for training purposes. 4 # The details given in paragraph 3 above can at^the moment only be accepted as an indication of what the Afghan Govt will require, and firm requests for arms and equipment wilo. probably not be handed over until the Afghan Govt have discussed with H.M* s Minister tne terms of payment for any war material supplied to them. The end of the war in Europe, and Argiian fears concerning Russian intentions have produced a feeling amongst seni,or Afghan officials that tiie present time 18 a propttious one for securing their requirements in war material from British or American sources, also for secluding soiie increase in certain types ox the arms and equipment otfored to the Afglian Military Mission at Delhi, senior ASgfatt sdll ^aiy officers have stressed the importance to tnem ol obuaxnirq, more rifles, light and medium machine guns ana mortars than the number offered by tne Govt of India, and though the head of the Military Mission was told by General ;?ir John ^wayne at Delhi tnat the numbers could not be increased, even tnou^^n the Afghan Govt decided to give up the offer of tne heavier artillery equipment, they continue to express the nope that now the war in ..urope is over they will be a ole to purchase more of the infantry weapons they require, x have not encouraged them in this idea and remincWthem that we ai e s will at wa.*. with Jaoan. The existing feeling amongst these Afghan officers is probably due to tne psychological effect of our having won the ^r inst Gcrmeny. It is however interesting to note that tlly Se conAr.trating on the simpler infant^ on. rath« than o'oin£»' for the more tectmical artilxery s^uipme-.t .,.uca 01 Sh^oSll not be of any real value to them in operations again st tribesmen in the Southern or Eastern provinces.-4- 5m The Chief tne general gtaff irh'oriiiea^taat his Govt had made enquiries through the American Legation in Kabul as to the possibility of their purohasing surplus transport and other connected equipment used by the ^ /aerican army on one Persian L of C and In ^gypt# he mentioned motor lorries and camp equipment etc, as possible purchases* Major Fox the American Military attache* told me about this request which was made through Mr* ^ngert th« American Minister in Kabul* He has promised to Keep me fully posted concerning any developments which may occur* The Chief of the General Staff also stated that he proposed to aelc for the supply of a number of 4,2 s * mortars from America as the Mission sad found that our 4*2 n mortar was an older and heavier model then the American one* In this connection please see page 26 of Appendix , B* of my report on the tour of the Afghan Military Mission in India* The effort made to convince officers of the Mission that our 4*2 U mortar was as good as the American one have not apparently been success ful. Ivwav Khan 6. The despatch of Afghan officers to India for training was again brought up by Generals Muhci Baud Khan Aon- 19 th and 22nd May. They propose to send some 50 officers, in two separate batches of 25, for courses of training at military schools in India. Full details were not given, but the courses mentioned included:- (a) a few officers to be sent for training in infbntry weapons. (b) a few officers to be sent for training in driving and maintenance of motor transport and supply auidea. Cc) a few officers to be sent for Signal Training including /T. C&amp;) a few officers to be sent for Artillery training both mountain and field guns. (e) a few officers to be sent to the armoured Vehicles School for training. (fj an unspecified nunber of officers and A.0.Os for training as engineers, armourers, equipment repairasetc* Definite- requests for such training are to be made later, but anxiety was expressed concerning tne high cost of maintaining Afghan officers in India, while under training, and mention was made of the 14 Afghan officers who are under training with the Survey Dept, Govt of India at z.bbottabad and are being paid an allowance of E 350 p.m. each for messing and other expenses while in India.. This was thought expensive, and I was asked whether the cost would be as high in the case of other officers sent to India for training. 7. Generals Muhd Baud Khan and Muhd t&amp;ar Khan spoke to me on May X9ih and 22nd about tneir plans for the ..fgiian Air Force including the purchase of trainer and operational aircraft and the tnlaing of mix force personnel in Xnaia. They asked for ray views after consulting the British pilot instructor as to the best ay in which to build up a more efficient air force. They deprecated the visit to Kabul of a senior officer to advise them as tnis might arouse Auesian suspicions, but would not object to an A*A.F. officer coming as my private guest should this prove necessary la tar on. They stated that their present plans envisaged 2 - va; an increase in the number of trainer aircraft with better training facilities at Kabul, and the despatch of more air force personnel to the A*a#F# in India lor training* (b)Para 7 Sa nta.. ■5- •H (b) tiie purchase of both trainer and operational aircraft from British sources with a view to making their Air Force efficient for internal security duties ana operations against tribesmen# They aid not wish to do anything in airforce matters tfhich would prejudice tneir relations with Russia* They pictured an ^ir Force of 2 or 3 squadx'ons of operational aircraft at Kabul* with additional flights at Jalalabad* Kandaimri Herat and Baghlan or Massar-i-Sharif# The flights at Kandahar* Herat and Baghlan or ^nar-i-SUarif to be increased to squadron strength after a few years as circumstances permitted* (c) that they were prepared to link themselves in all air force matters a no particularly training with the H.A,F. in India. They were very satisfied with what we had done for their air force during the past lew years* and the behaviour of our British instructors in Afghanistan* They would never repeat the experience of xhaving Russian instructors in the Afghan air force* as was done during tne reign of ex King Amanull&amp;h when these Aliasian instructors spent their time spying out tne land and conducting intensive propaganda in favour of tlie Soviet r egiaiC • vd) the placing on a better basis tixeir arrangements for storing ana accounting for the expendittoe of air force spares* They would perhaps ask for a stores officer %p be trained in India, and also possibly for the loan of the services of an i'i*n*F* stores H*C*0. for a period* Ce) the engagement of two or three more officers or h*G*Qs* one to be an observer and 1 /T instructor* and the other a photographic and ‘ /T instructor similar to those Hhi.F* H.C.Os who had been in Knbul in 1941. /them • I iniormed/that the first question we should be compelled to ask before giving them any advice was the amount of money they could afford to allot to the purchase of further aircraft ana equipment in the initial stage* and what sum they would be prepared to allot per annum for the up keep and maintenance of their Aii Force* In reply they stated that they had thought of this, and that though they coulc not give figures K*H.H* The Minister of defence intended to discuss this aspect of the problem with H.H's minister and myself in the near future. It has now been arranged tnat H.R.H* The kinistxr of Defence comes to the Lega lion for tea on 2Gth May to give him an opportunity of stating his views. Tne Chief of the General Staff intimated that the decisions regarding the purchase of the Tiger Moth trainer aircraft* and operational aircraft were held up pending the out come of the discussion n±Xk which H.R.H. The Minister of Defence is to have on 26th &gt;,ay or any subsequent discussions which my take place. He also hinted that within reason his Govt were prepared tc be guided by our advice in air force affairs and expressed an ernesu desire for our assistance and co-operation* 8* During the course of the conversations described in paragraph ? above mention was made of three points which are of general interest* The first was taat they thought X might have noted that the Russians had used a large G# 4/ passenger aircraft for their courier service in April* They had forbidden the use of the khwaja .towash airfield to the Russians* and informed^tiat only the Sharp or airfield could be utilized* The Russians had complains a that the Sherpux airfield was too small for the G• 4? to use* but tire Afghan Govt had stood firm and refused landing facilities at Khwaja R&amp;wash as they suspected infiltration tactics on the part'aof the Russians in respect . &lt;general passenger as opposed to a diploma aic courie a more between Tashkent and Kabul* The sec one!raya S QqxlUx. - 6 - The second point auenticned was that no decision had been reach^ by the Afghan Govt regarding the introduction of any civil air service between Afghanistan and other countries. The whole problem bristled with difficulties for them, and they thought that the subject was essentially one for the Afghan ; i o is try for Foreign Affairs was a proposal that with. The last point brought up e considering to the effect that they shoulu have use on internal and the | spaamoaio to deal they we few aircraft of tha Beach craft type for services between Kabul postal and passenger air he service would probably pr ovmc la 1 towns. be spasmodic at first, and linked with the Afghan air force. The Beach craft type of aircraft would carry rails and a few passengers, and being a small aircraft would be able to utilize the landing grooms which already exist. This proposed air service would provide useful employment for ^fghan pilots and assist them in creating a reserve -of pilots for their /:• ir Force. 9. minister is forwarding a copy of this letter to hxterml Affairs Department, Govt of India, and to the India Office, bona on, for their information, .men further approaches are made or other developments 00001 ’ X will let you know.

The photograph of the tracked carrier has been passed on to the Afghan Chief of the General Staff but as he is in disposed at the moment I have not been able to obtain any reactions regarding Afghan military opinion on the suitability of the carrier for use in the Afghan Army. 3. The sample 3ten Machine Carbine arrived yesterday, rather curiously through the American Legation. I propose to deliver it to the Afghan Ministry of Defence one day next week. 4. The Ministry of Defence have not so far made any definite or firm approaches to me concerning their requirements in weapons and equipment, or for facilities for training officers and N.C.Os in India. These subjects have however been under frequent discussion with me by the Afghan Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Muhd Umar Khan and the G.O.C-in-C of the Kabul Army Corps Lt. Gen. Muhd Baud Khan. I understand from them that two lists of their requirements have been prepared, one for early supply and one for more distant supply, and that these lists are ready and have been handed to the Minister for Foreign affairs who is first of all to discuss the whole problem of the supply of war material to Afghanistan by Gt. Britain and Inaia, witn particular relation to terms of payment, with s Minister. After this formal approach has been made and terms of payment on a cash basis or an instalment system have been decided, the detailed list of the Afghan Govt*s requirements will be handed to me. In this connection please see my D/Q letter to Brig. a.o. Boss No. 402/A/MA dated 15th March 1945. I have not thought it advisable to press the Afghan military authorities during the discussion stages for a reply to our token offer of weapons and equipment since experience shows that they became suspicious when unduly pressed for decisions. I still anticipate that we shall have fairly extensive requests for arms and equipment of various kinds in the near future• 5. On 12th May Lt. Gen. Muhd Baud Khan spoke to me regarding the training of Afghan officers and N.C.Os in India, and intimated that he would probably despatch same 40 or 50 officers for training. He would like to discuss the whole question with me, and I propose to take an early opportunity of doing so. It is however possible that final decisions concerning the despatch of -fghan officers on course of training in India will depend on the outcome of the formal approach which is to be made to H.M*s Minister by the Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the supply of arms and equipment and the terms of payment for items supplied.4 V 1 6. On the American side, Major Fox has not so far been called on to discuss with the Afghan authoritiesany questions of the supply of war material or the training of Afghan officers and N.C.Qs, though during the past few days both he and the American Minister, Mr. Angert, have been asked to make enquiries from Teheran and Cairo as to whether any surplus American equipment on the l ersian L of C or in Egypt will be available for sMe to the fghan Govt* Mr* »Engert lias therefore sent telegrams to Teaexan and Cairo^.wi*t, equipment if any, is available for sale* I imagine that any equipment, available will cons list of transport vehicles and connected material. 7. I eja watching the position carefully, and will let you know at once when any developments occur, or when any firm requests for the supply of war material or for training are made.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002f4_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2218</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002f4</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2218</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 7/48 'Afghanistan: Col.
