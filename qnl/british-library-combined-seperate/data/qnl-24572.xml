There had never been any previous necessity for an application from the Khan to be required and was never entertained.The letter concludes by informing the Colonel that he should have abstained from calling Captain Harrison away from Khelat and instructing him to rescind the order and direct the Captain to remain at Khelat.Enclosed with the letter is a true translation of a letter from His Highness the Khan of Khelat to Moolla Peer Bux requesting that he present himself to the Khan as soon as possible following Moolla Mahomed Khan, Vakeel's appointment to Kedj and stating that he required him to work under Captain Harrison.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000022#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
