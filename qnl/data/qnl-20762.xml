Anderson writes that his letter has been forwarded to the Resident at Lucknow and the Government of India. Enclosed with Anderson’s letter is a letter (folio 357) from W. Howard, Acting Advocate General at Bombay, to Anderson, dated 18 September 1854. Howard writes that he is unaware of any law under which Indian subjects of a state in alliance with the East India Company, who purchase slaves in Persia, can be punished on their return to India. However, Howard states that if individuals have breached the
                           lex loci, they should be liable to prosecution in the place the offence was committed, even if they are foreigners.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000060#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
