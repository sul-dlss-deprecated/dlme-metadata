Eastern and General Syndicate. Anglo-Persisn Oil Company. Period* 70 years (5 yeras of which are stated to be for exploratory work and selection of areas)• Period. Exploration 3 years. Test drilling 2 years, lease 70 years. Comment. Exploration and Prospecting. Whichever Company is granted the Concession, will find it necessary to caary out exploratory work as the geology of the country is much obscured by superficial deposits* The Eastern and General Syndicate refer rather vaguely to ^Exploratory work” by geologists and engineers, which it ey undertake to begin within 9 months of the date of concession, failing which the Shaikh may cancel the Concession. Nothing is said as to drilling and the Syndicate require a period of 5 years for their exploratory work. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company ask for a maximum period of two years for exploratory work, which will be reduced ii they undertake drilling within that period, to be followed by a maximum period of two years, during which they undertake to drill at least 4,000 ft.X r - 2 * Period of Lease. As regards the period of lease both oorapaniss ask for approximately the same terms. In the case of a country such as Kuwait where the existence of oil has not been proved, it is considered desirable that the period of Lease should be a long one. The work of proving and developing an oilfield involves very heavy capital expenditure and companies are not likely to be attracted unless there is a guarantee of their being able to obtain a long period in *foich they may have an opportunity of securing a return on the money expended. There are precedents for such a period as is now asked for in Iraq, where the period granted by the Iraq Government is 75 years, in Persia where the period is 60 years, and in Bahrain where a similar period is provided for. In his letter of 25th August 1932 (36/1932) the Political Resident mentions that he under stands that the Shaikh himsWkf asked for a period of 70 years. Eastern &amp; Genera^ Syndicate. Area, The right to explore the whole territory of Kuwait and select an area for ultimate development not exceeding 1,640 square miles divided into 6 or more blocks. ,— 4hAlo-Persian. Oil Gov. Area. The draft agreement covers the whole of Kuwait territory for the whole period of the concession. Comment. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company's draft concession provides for the grant of the whole of the area of Kuwait, for the period of the concession. On the other hand, the Eastern and General Syndicate provide for the selection v within 5 years of an area amounting in the aggregate to 1,640 square miles, p this area may be divided up into six or more bloav*. w arrangement * * such an they presumably hope to secure all premising oil bearing territory which is worth having. The value of their proposal to limit their activities to 1,640 square miles is, therefore, more apparent than real. There would appear to be definite advanjfc- ages In having the whole of this rather limited territoryterritory developed by one company of good standing* ^ Competitive development of an oilfield by two or more companies seldom produce the best results y as it tends to lead to unnecessary loss of gas pressure and premat(^re exhaustion of the field, as Ms been the case in many fields in the United States* The operations of the Anglc-Persian Oil Company in Persia are generally accepted as being in accordance with the best modern practice of unit development* It may be mentioned that in the case of Iraq there was in the original concession a provision for the selection of areas. So much difficulty aroee in regard to this matter that the Iraq Government agreed In the revised Concession granted last year, to accept the Iraq Petroleum Company’s proposal for the grant to them of exclusive ri^its over a large area amounting to about 36,000 square miles, or nearly twice the area of Kuwait. Incidentally the Eastern and General Syndicate refer to the area to be reserved to them as 'Conceded Territory' There are obvious objections to the use of such a term and this should b© replaced by 'Lease Area'. Eastern and General Syndicate. Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Working Ob ligations. The Concession to become void unless the Company has commenced exploratory work within a period of 9 months from the date of the Con cession. If, after commenc ing operations following the exploratory period of 5 years, ths Company discontinue the same for a continuous period of 2 years, the Shaikh shall have the ri^it to cancel the agreement. Comment. Working Obligation. After a maximum period of two years for exploration, the Company undertake^ within a period of 2 years to drill in a workmanlike manner a total depth overall of at least 4,000 feet. If the Company fails to carry out its obligations, or to make the necessar' payments, the Shaikh has the power to ter minate the agreement. Nothing is said in the Eastern and General Syndicate's draft oonoession as to drilling obligations, and as tha draft now stands they would have ©ar led out thesethese obligations if they only did surface and shallow geological drilling. It may he suggested, that they will have to do such work as will enable them to select their areas, but as the commont on this questionjindioate they can select any number of blocks in choosing their 1,640 square miles. obtained a concession in 1925. This provided for an Exploration period of two years and a prospecting period of two years, subject to extensions. In 1927 the Syndicate assigned their rights to American interests, and they have not yet taken a Mining Lease. They have recently applied for a further extension of the prospecting period and have only recently begun work on a second well. least 4,000 ft. overall in a period which under the terms of the draft cannot exceed 4 years, and may be less, the Anglo- Persian Oil Company does give an indication of serlos endeavour to prove oil. Further the provision in the Eastern and Creneral o ^ f operations Syndicate s draft that they may discontinue feov continuous periods up to 2 years before they run the risk of losing their concession is unusual, and hardly indicates an intention to carry on exploitation as speedily as possible. A provision of this kind is included in some oil concessions, but six months is a much more usual period, althou^i a period up to 12 months is sonetimes provided fcr. In Bahrain the Eastern and General Syndicate On the pther hand, to undertake to drill at Eastern and General Syndicate. Anglo-Persjs n Oil Coy-.

Comment. A royalty of Rs.2-10 per ton of petroleum, subject to the following payments. During the first year Rs.50,000 plus any royalty eeorued with minimum payment of Rs.65,000; during the 2 nd year a minimum of Rs.80,000 and annually thereafter a minimum of Bs. 100,000 unless operations are interrupted through causes outside the control of Company, when payment will con tinue at annual rate of Rs.25,000. If the company fail to make a declaration as to commercial production by a date in 1941 to be specified, the Shaikh to have power to call upon the ocmp&amp;ny either to make the declaration forthwith or to lose the concession* It will be seen that the Anglo-Persian Oil. Company offer a higher amount on signature of the Concession, and a higher annual amount when they commence drilling (which must happen within 2 years of signature of the concession). Except for the first year after the declaration that oil has been produced in commercial quantities, their minimum royalty is also higher than that offered by the Eastern and General Syndicate. It will also be observed that the Anglo—Persian Oil Company must iaaj:e a declaration by a date to be specified in 1941, that oil has been found in commercial quantities or surrender the concession. In the Eastern and General Syndicated draft this question has to be settled by arbitration. Bearing in mind the absence of any specific drilling obligations during theperiod of 5 years provided by the Eastern and General Syndicate’s draft for the exploration period, it seems unlikely that that there wculd be much prospect of taking the Syndicate to arbitration at an earlder date than that by which the Anglo- - Persian Oil Company must make their declaration. After the declaration that commercial production has been obtained the Syndicate offer a tonnage royalty of Rs.5. annas 8 per ton and the Anglo-Persi an Oil Company a roylaty of Sis. 10-annas. To decide which of these is better in the interests of the Shaikh depends on the production«» 6 «* production mhloh 1 b likely to be secured* And here the amount Dortant, Generally speaking the Coy. with the higher minimum royalfr of minimum royalty/will have the greater inducement to produce oil* Itpi may also be said that too high a tonnage royalty may retard production, and here the provision in the Eastern and General Syndicates draft, allowing a eesra&amp;ion of operations should not be lost sight of* The rate of royalty offered by the Eastern and General Syndicate is the same as that in India, but there is a local market to absorb all the product!cm* The rate offered by the Anglo-^ersiJn Oil Company is approximately the earns as that levied by the Iraq Governs® nt* In Venezuela the rate of royalty is understood not to exceed &amp;/- a ton in most instances, while in Trinidad there are many leases with a roylaty of from 1/C to 2/5 although in recent years a royalty of 3/- has been imposed* In the case of both these countries, over 90 per cent of the oil has to be exported* Eastern and General Syndicate* * Anglo-^ersian Oil Company* Qua toms Duty * The company Customs Mty* Ho similar undertake to pag the Shaikh provision, a Customs Duty of 1$ on all oil produced from Kuwait territory, calculated on tbs value of the oil at the wells* Oommait. It is not usual to impose a Customs Duty in addition to royalty* Such &amp; charge mi^it with some justifi cation be levied in a country where the State does not own the mineral ri^its and desires to secure some financial consider ation for the loss of a wasting asset such as petroleum* But where the State is the owner of the minerals it is regarded as preferable that the State should take the whole of its financial return in the shape of royally. Apart from the principle involved there is bound to be seme difficulty in assessing the value of the oil for purposes of the duty, whether at thethe well head, or port of shipment. There are some oases in ™ ' • &gt;£ : $ which royalty is charged on the basis of a percentage of the value of the oil won, and endless difficulty has arisen in finding a satisfactory method of determining the value* In Trinidad, where the Crovernm&amp;nt owns the greater part of the minerals and the question has been thoroughly considered, the idea of an export tax has been definitely abandoned as unsuitable* General Observations T xhe foregoing notes deal with the more important provisions of the draft concessions and will it is thou^it enable the Shaikh to reach a decision as to which application is likely to be more acceptable to him* Besides the points dealt with there are certain provisions which ought to be included in any concession which may be granted of which the following are the more important, sane of these may b© covered in part by the existing drafts:- 1. During the exploratory period, the work of exploration should be commenced within a specified period, and carried on continuously under the supervision of a fully qualified petroleum geologist* Correct geological plans and records should be kept, which should be open to insoeotion by the Shaikhjd or his representative at all reasonable times. 2 * The Company should give an undertaking at all times during the continuance of the Concession to carry on an operations for winning and working crude oil, and natural gas in a skilful and workmanlike manner and in accordance with modern approved methods; to maintain all productive borings in • good repair, working order and condition and to take all prac tical measuredo prevent the injurious access of water to the oil bearing formations. S. The Company should furnish an annual report of their operations, together with a plan showing the location of all wells drilled. They should also keep accurate records•• 8 — records of the drilling 'logs' of all wells, showing all casing inserted and any water horizons passed through. 4* All abandoned boreholes whould be plugged so as to prerent ingress of water, and excavations fenced off if the Gcmpany is required to do so. 5. There should be a provision for the measure-r ment of any oil won, for purposes of ascertainment of royalty. A draft of a suitable clause is appended. 6 * It msy be desirable to provide for the revision of the rate of royalty at intervals of ,say ,10 years, on tlie application of either party, such revision to be based on the general trend of world prices for petroleum products. Minimum and maximum rate of royalty should be laid down in the first instance. 7* It is usual to provide for a royalty on any natural gas sold. The equivalent of 2 d. (? 2 annas) per thousand cubic feet is suggested as a suitable rate. It might also be provided that in the event of casing-head gasoline being produced the Shaikh may fix a royalty at a rate not exceeding the equivalent of l/ 2 d. a gallon. 8 .

Kuwait Oil,764 / 121 / 91 ) 34EMO RAN DUM OP C ONYERBATI QN l In a nets ^rem the Brittsh'^oreign Secretary p dated April Sp 1932 (No* E 1733/121/91 ), regarding an application cf the Eastern and General Syndicate, Limited, for an oil concession in Koweit, reference is made to the extended period of time th&amp;t oil companies have been interested in oil lands in Koweit® The Eastern and General Syndicate initiated and carried on negotiations with the Sheikh of Koweit for an (4,1 concession in his Principality with the knowledge and approval of the British Government but it was not until after American Interests became associated in the venture with \/he oyndicate in 1927 that th@ British Government required (in lw'2d) the inclusion in the concession agreement of a ’'nationality clause', which clause would have the effect °* deluding any but purely British interests from exploiting such a conceseiono Thus the Syndicate for years prior to 1927 end in agreement with American interests since 1927 has contin uous Xy endeavored to obtain a concession in 'Koweit very similar in principle to a concession which, with the uAuw^edge of the British Foreign Office, had been granted to the Syndicate in the Bahrein Islands® Last December American interest in the Koweit concession formed the basis of representations by the American Ambassador to the British Secretary of State for Fl reign Affairs* In referring to these representations, the Foreign Office note of April 9, mentioned above, stated ohat 'His Majesty’s Government for their part are prepared tQ agree t0 the omission from any oil concession, which the Sheikhul Sheikh may he prepared to grant, of a clause confining it to British interests On September 6, 1932, however, the American Embassy* in a note to the Foreign Office urged that early appropriate steps might he taken, that this statement become effective, and that the American interests involved might he placed in as favorable a position as a British oil company in having its application considered by the Sheikh of Koweit* In acknowledging this note of September 6, a Foreign Office note in reply stated: 'his Majesty's Government decided they could not advise the sheikh to give prefer entia l treatment to the Eastern and General Syndicate'. In the opinion of the Department of State, some misunderstanding may exist in the mind of the British Government in this connection, since no preferential treatment has been asked for American interests, nor has any been granted. It may be recalled that the American Ambassador, in discussing the Mcweit oil concession with sir John Simon last December, pointed out that the Eastern and General Syndicate had initiated and carried on its negotiations with the Sheikh with the knowledge and approval of the British Government; that the Syndicate had offered the Angle-Persian Oil Company the opportunity, over six years a £P* to interest itself in the Koweit ell concession which opportunity that company declined; that according to hi® information it was only after efforts to interest the Angle-Persian Oil Company and other British groups in the ©aid concession that the Syndicate sought to interest and, inia i! ~ ve3! '- er 192?, succeeded In Interesting the American company since then associated with it in the venture; that it was after these American interests became associated with the Syndicate in 1987 that the British Government in 1928 insisted upon the inclusion of a 'nationality clause' which for a period of several years from that date had prevented the Syndicate from consummating with the Sheikh the concession it. sought. Since the withdrawal of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1986, it ie only, I under stand, during this last year (1931-1938) cf the Eastern snd General Syndicate's negotiations that the Anglc- Persian Oil Company (in October 1931) manifested further interest in Koweit, On the contrary, the Syndicate has osan conducting its negotiations with unceasing activity for many years. It may also be recalled that it was net ■Rtil April cf this year that the British Government reached -s.-.,:; decision to the urgent representations initiated by the American Ambassador in the latter part of last year- If a moei recent Foreign Office note it was stated that the Anglc-Persian oil Company submitted a draft concession for consideration in August last, and study cf this Anglo-Persian draft will necessitate further and. considerable delay in His Majesty's Government's reaching 8 ' y ccr-elusicn regarding the draft concession which sub sequent to receipt cf the Foreign Office note of April 9, IWH, the Eastern and General Syndicate submitted to the shiikh cn May 26, thus renewing its application for the Koweit oil concession which, as above indicated, it has .n n .go tiating in association with American interests unremittingly ter many yearso With i0 With reference to representations made by the American Ambassador to the Foreign Secretary in December, it may be well to draw attention to General Dawes 9 letter to Sir John Simon of December 22, pointing out the Mining Lease Act of February 25, 1920, regarding lands under which British subjects are given the same treatment as American citizens. The text of this letter reads as follows; ''London, December 22 ? 1931c tf My dear Sir John: “In furtherance of my remarks to you the other day regarding the Koweit oil concession?

Tne views of the Army Council would be definitely on record sc far as the Resident is concerned and the difficulties which both we and tfe Foreign Office are likely to feel about any specific reference in the private telegram to a partic- -ui&amp;r item of correspondence would be avoided.

In view of the general conclusions readied at the meeting of the Official Bub-Committee for Questions concerning the Middle East on the 2nd December, My Lords concur in the despatch of the two telegrams, subject to the following Observationss- The words 'questions at issue have now been discussed with other Government Departraents and' at the beginning of the first telegram appear to be superfluous and might conceivably convey an erroneous impression of general departmental agreement. The draft of the private and personal telegram to the Political Resident contains no special reference to Admiralty Letter M.02977 of the 18th November. y Lords consider it is important that the letter ahould be mentioned and that the Resident should be aware that the views expressed in it are shared by the Service Departments. Accordingly they propose that an addition to the telegram be made in the sense that 'Admiralty views as expressed in Admiralty letter of 18th November are shared by War Office and Air Ministry”.

From the last paragraph of my telegram No# 9fi of 22 nd December you will have seen that we had hoped that in the light of Petroleum Department's memorandum and discussion with you and Dickson,Shaikh of Kuwait would have felt able to make an&lt;| early,if not necessarily an immediate,decision as between the Anglo Persian Oil Company ||| i and the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate on a broad view of the financial and other major considerations involved. It seems possible now that the decision may be unduly delayed and the position complicated by discussion with the eom- 1 petitors of the details of the draft concessions# This be would/likely,incidentally,to raise important points in connection with safeguards and also with such questions as Railways,Telegraphs,exclusion of certain areas etc., on which the Shaikh will require the advikce of H.M's Government. I shall be glad,therefore,if,unless you see any objection,you will indicate to the Shaikh the desirability of avoiding discussion of such details until he has decided which company to grant the concession to. You will also no doubt ensure that the Shaikh gives the representatives of the companies clearly to understand that it is condition of the discussion that he may,after he had made his decision as between the competing companies require amendment of draft agreement on any points on which H.M's Government advise him to insist (in this connection please see last sentence of penultimate para graph of my telegram No:9 of 22nd December. This proviso in itself renders detailed discussion of any but general and financial features of draft2 concessions useless at this stage. Shaikh can,I presume, he relied upon to keep Political Agent generally informed of the course of discussions with representatives of the companies. Please report hy telegram whether Shaikh has shown any ! indication of taking any decision,and if not,whether he is likely to do so in the near future. The Eastern General Syndicate were informed on receipt of your telegram of 14th January ( 1 ) that you had telegraphed asking that they he advised that you had presented to the Shaikh the comments of H.M*s Government on their proposals and those of the Anglo Persian Oil Company, and ( 2 ) that you had notified the local representative of the Anglo Persian Oil Company of the position.

Confidential, FOREIGN OFFICE,S.W.l, 23rd December, 1932. id We have made enquiries about the point which you mentioned to Vansittart yesterday morning in connexion with the question of the proposed Kuwait Oil Concession. As you know, it concerns a number of different departments of His Majesty’s Government and at every stage complicated inter departmental discussions have been necessary. As Vansittart told your Ambassador in his letter* of the 11th November, the document embodying the result of the examination of the two draft conces sions submitted by the Eastern and General Syndicate and by the Anglo Persian Oil Company respectively had, at that date, been already despatched to the British authorities in the Persian Gulf. But I fear that the suggestion ip Vansittart*s letter of November 11th that this document would within a very short time of its receipt by them be communicated to the Shaikh for his consideration was somewhat over optimistic. Further inter-departmental dis cussions have had to take place in the interval, and have thus caused some further delay in the communication of the document to the Shaikh. I have now done all I can to speed matters up, and the local British authorities should now be in a position to proceed in the matter with the Shaikh in the very near future. I am so sorry for this recent and quite unexpected additional delay which has arisen but which has now been terminated.

Hall derived from his short talk with you on the 23rd December the impression that you had practically succeeded in making arrangements with the Mellon oil group under which they and you would take up the proposed Kuwait oil concession on a fifty-fifty basis, and that there was some prospect also of arranging that the Burma Oil Company should take over the Bahrain oil concession* From your remarks to me, however, I gathered that the Mellon group intended to go on pressing their interests in Kuwait as much as possible, if only as a potential 'nuisance-asset'. 2, The United States Government are as you may know much interested in the question of the proposed Kuwait concession and we have frequent correspondence and conversations with the United States Embassy about it* Would you therefore, very kindly let me know in more detail the actual present position of your negotiations with the Mellon Group in order that we may know how to guide out steps in discussing the matter with the Americans ? Other Government departments besides the Foreign Office being intimately concerned in the Kuwait oil question, it might help us to mention your negotiations with the Mellon Group in discussing it with them. It would be of special interest to know how near the negotiations are to a successful conclusion. 3. Anything more you can tell u 8 of the proposal that the Burma Oil Company should take over the Bahrain oil concession would also be of interest. ^signed) Lancelot Oliphant.

INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL,S.W.l. iyth January 1933. Confidential . My dear Warner, We were much interested in the correspondence between Dliphant and Cadman enclosed in your official letter of 14th January, Alo. E 25/12/91 about the proposed Kuwait oil concession. We are not, however, quite clear as to the precise nature of the arrangement which Cadman has in view and while the discussions are apparently still at a very early stage, and the Shaikh’s decision as between the Eastern and General Syndicate and the Anglo Persian Oil Company will vitally affect matters, we shall be very grateful for some further information about it. 2. The important point is the nature of the 50-50 basis which apparently figures in the discussions. Does this mean merely that in the event of the Shaikh deciding to grant the Kuwait concession to the Anglo Persian Oil Company, the Anglo Persian Oil Company and the Mellon group might reach an understanding under which distribution of oil won from Kuwait would be on a 50-50 basis, the actual exploitation of the concession remaining entirely in British hands? (If this is correct consideration might, I suppose have to be given to the securing to His Majesty’s Government of a right of pre-emption over the whole supply in the event of war - though that is not primarily an India Office point). 3. Alternatively, is there any question in any circumstances of the Anglo Persian Oil Company contemplating: (a) the concession ceasing to be under bona fide majority British control; (b) the introduction of American personnel to develop the Kuwait concession, or the.transfer of exploitation of that concession to American interests ? 4. ...

Sir, In reply to your letter of the 21st January, No.18119/33, on the subject of the Kuwait oil concession, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that, as Sir Philip Gunliffe-Lister is aware, he has throughout been of opinion that it would be preferable if possible to postpone discussion of the details of the concession to be negotiated with the Shaikh of Kuwait by the successful competitoi &gt; for the Kuwait concession until Kis Excellency has taken a definite decision in fvaour of one or other of the competing companies on a broad view of the financial and other major considerations involved. Once such a decision has been taken, it could be followed by detailed negotiations, with which the local representatives of His Majesty’s Government could be closely associated and in the course of which steps could be taken to advise the Shaikh as to the points which it was desirable to cover either in his own interest or in that of His Majesty’s Government. Subject to the views of the other interested Departments, the Secretary of State for India is inclined, therefore, to suggest chat while conveying general approval to the course of action proposed by Colonel Fowle in paragraph 4 of his despatch No.52, of 2?th December 1932, Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, if he sees no objection, might also inform the Resident that His Majesty’s Government are anxious that a definite decision should be taken by the Shaikh as between the competing companies with as little delay as possible; that he and the Political Agent, Kuwait, should do what they can to encourage him to take such a decision f on/ ’he Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office,- 2 - Uqsi oi i3^ a 52; 1^9108' ’sU-sVli;: [ 9Cf Muoij, ’(d Jti x. giH I.: isiljo 10 s: ins liijiii! il noioioo: s no ffw lo 983i !

The Resident might be instructed that in these circumstances the local representatives of the ^nglo Persian Oil Comapny (and of the Eastern and General Syndicate if and when a similar question arises in respect of their application} should be warned that while they can initiate and conduct negotiations without further reference to His Majesty’s Government on the basis of their provisional drafts, those drafts in their present form would require amendment in various particulars in the event of the Shaikh deciding in favour of the competitor concerned, but that His Majesty’s Government propose to postpone communication of their views on the points in question to the Shaikh until his Excellency has reached a decision as between the applicants for an oil concession and the preparation of a final draft can more profitably be undertaken. 2.

Anglo-Persian Oil Company have also strongly urged desirability, in their interests, of meeting shaikh immediately over date gardens and blockade. v/hile, however, we are doing our utmost in interests of shaikh to expedite decision, I fear it would be optimistic to hope for settlement in near future. Moreover, anxious as we are that Company should secure this concession if this can be done without violating our pledges to tne Americans, I feel that it is most important to deal with it on a commercial basis and that tneir best hope of securing it lies in making an offer to the Shaikh definitely more attractive than that put up by the Syndicate, in which event X hope that he would not be ao short-sighted as to allow either of above questions to influence his decision. Company are accordingly being informed that removal of political obstacles cannot be looked for in the near future but that in any case question is, in lan: our view, one to be dealt with essentially on a commercial basis and that it is for them to consider what steps they should take to counter activities or ofler^ of competitors. 2.

This must inevitably handicap the Company in their negotiations, while Shaikh, on his side, may well wish to see the outcome of the renewed discussions between the Company and the Persians before finally committing himself to the ftnglo-Pers ian Oil Company; in any case it appears from your reports that Shaikh is anxious t o be allowed to take decision in his own time. So far as we are concerned, therefore, thereis for the present no objection to the Shaikh’s postponing final decision for some time longer and continuing process of bargaining with both parties. 3.

On Colonel JicScson enquiring from the dhailch e. to the correctnese of Hr.

Government had been consulted, and given their pern i ae i on.// / d permmssi on. 2. Witii regard to His j^xceliency 1 s letter of l&amp;th February, I thouglit it best to try and settle tiie matter informally and so naked Colonel Diokson to take a suitable opportunity to explain verbally to the Shaikh that if he visited England es the guest of the syndicate there might be difficulties about treating hi a visit as official. This hint was duly passed on to His Excellency whose only remark - so Colonel Dickson informs me - was to the effect that presumably the Political Resident would reply to hia official letter by a similar missive. 3. Both Colonel Dickson and X think it distinctly un desirable that the Shaikh should visit England as the ’guest* of either the Syndicate or Mr. Jans on. On the other hand the days, in my opinion, hare definitely gone by when we can keep the more important Arab Eulers of the Cult - so long as they adhere to the terms of their treaties with us - in leading strings. I think in the long run we are likely to et more from them by - whenever possible - letting them make the their own choice, witi^ ensuing consequences. I think it is probable too that His Excellency will show whatever oflicial reply he receives to the Syndicate. I have had these various considerations in mind when drafting the reply, which I en close, to the Shaikh’s letter of loth February, and which I sug* est I be authorised to send# X would have preierred to settle the matter informally as in paragraph 2 a owe without troubling Government on the subject. /s, however, the Shaikh has insisted on making ’heavy weather 1 of the question, and on receiving an official reply* one hfcs to be sent, 1 therefore thought it best to submit a draft before replying. 4/-5- // V'' * would be grateful for telegrapJriic approval of the above draft.

In a further letter Colonel hickson informed me that he h d received a letter from Hr. lanson, one of the Directors of the eastern and General Syndicate Limited, stating that the invitation for Tour Excellency to visit -ngl&amp;nd had now been changed to an invitation from Mr. Janson himself, instead of from the Syndicate. To this invitation - so Colonel Dickson informed rae - Your Ixcellency had given the same reply as to the invitation from the Coei.sny. I am directed by His Majesty’s Government to reply to Your uJtcellency as follows. While a Huler oi a State often pays short visits to an Cil/f ield. or a factory, belong hug to a Company for the i purposes of inspection, it is unusual for a ruler to visit for the purpose of pleasure and change of rir a foreign country where the Company has no woi’ks of its own to show him, and to permit that Company, or one of its members, to pay the expenses of that visit.

Dear Mr. Hearn, As you are no doubt aware, I recently had some discussion and correspondence with Cadman about the Kuwait Oil Concession. In the course of the discussion Cadman referred to certain political difficulties between the Shaikh and His Majesty’s Government and enquired whether there was any prospect of the early removal of these difficulties. Unfortunately there is no such prospect, though we are of course concerned to dispose of them as rapidly as may be; and since we are committed to a policy of not influencing the Shaikh, the question is one essentially to be dealt with on a commercial basis. My object in writing .to you now is to say that so far as we can judge, the Shaikh is not likely to be much moved by the difficulties! in question if the Anglo.Persian Oil Company put up an offer which, viewed commercially, is definitely very much better than that put up by the Eastern and General Syndicate, and in these circumstances it seems to us to be for the Company to consider what steps should be taken to counter the activities or offers of their competitors in Kuwait. Mours very truly, (Sgd.J S. H. Y/ilson.Point.s discussed wit.li His Excellency tlie Sheikh of Kuwait on 10th April 1933 with the Honble. the Political Resident. I. I. P.R. asked Sheikh not to make any decision with regard to the competing oil Companies until the P.R. returned from England (6th Ma,y) 1933, Sheikh gladly agreed. 2® The P.R. said he understood from Col® Dickson that the two drafts mentioned Dy the Sheikh (see Dicksons letter No«,5B of 22nd March) were now out of date, since H.E. had infoemed Col. Dickson that Sl» J. Cadman on his recent visitto Kuwait, had made a further , and apparently final offer, which was distinctly in advance of anything hlthertoo offered by E.&amp;.Gr.S. Col. Fowl# said that he would be grateful if before Sheikh accepted any proposal from either Comoany, ho (HoE.) would submit the draft proposal for H.M.CIs advice, as he had already done In case of Initial proposals. Col. Fowle ask&lt;fd the Sheikh to submit the proposal to H.M.C. without indicating to the Company propos ing it # that he (H.E.) intended giving It to them. The Sheikh agreed immediatly to this suggest ion, and said that it had always be^n his intention to do SO o Note . The point of this request is that the Sheikh for some reason might like to accept a worse offer (commercially) from the E.G.S., because of Holmes influence over him, or because Holmes in prepared to give him a secret gratuity, which would not appear in the published agreement, or because H.E. might like to Interest the American Government in Kuwait,with the object of playing off H.M.G. versus the American Govt. If however H.E. as he has prom ised, submits the final proposal from either Compan , f q£&gt; advice of H.M.G. , the latter in the above contingency, would be quite at liberty xn the form of advice, to point out that the proposal which the Sheikh was willing to accept from the E.G.S.E.G-.S. was inferior commercially to that which th© AP.O.C. were willing to eiv«. Colo ?owlt who had been informed by Col, Dickson that the Sheikh was keeping oil questions very dark, took the opportunity without unduly crossing the Ts or dotting the Is, to bring to the Sheikhs ;] V notice latter from Col, Dickson to Sheikh, last u i m -i n i- jqara, No.3^ dated 12th February, which ran as follovg M Lastly I dcsirod by Hon. the Political \ /' ’•&gt; Resident , to remind Jlour Excellency to keep me, your friend, generally inferred of the progress of Tour Excellency^, discuss ions, with the representat ives of the two oil Companies The Sheikh protested tnat he had always done so, and would always donso , Kuwait 10.4.33. / i r\Copy of a secret demi official letter No.DO/14/115 dated the 10th April 19S3, from the Special Service Officer Basrah to the Political Agent, Kuwait. During the visit of Wing Commander Graham and myself to Kuwait you mentioned a shooting trip that the Subah family had undertaken in the vicinity of Jariya. I have been making a few enquiries about it and give you hereunder the results. (a) From three separate sources (one of them of known reliability and the other two believed to be so) it is reported that Ibn Saud camped at A1 Khufaisa ( Shown as A1 Skafaisat Iluhammari, 43 miles south of A1 Haba on the Million Sheet) from the 15th February to about the 8th March. (b) Yusif as Salim al Badr says he accompanied the Subah on the trip. They reached al Wiriya, near Jariya, slept there, then to Al Musannat and thence to Kuwait. He denied that Shaikh Ahmad met either Ibn Saud him self or Saud ibn Saud. (c) A Zubairi who lives v/ith the Bani Hussain says that Saud ibn Saud was on a shooting trip by car and stopped at the Bani Hussain camp near the Musannat about the 16th March, ^e borrowed 3 camels which he sent to Jariya for supplies and on their return left in the direction 8f the Summan. (d) A reliable agent states that a man named As Sukhaili (Bani Khalid) who was camped at Warba, near Jariya, told him that Ibn Subah reached al Wiriya where a car belonging to Saud ibn Saud was waiting. This car guided them to Rijlat adh Dhabi where ibn Subah met Saud ihn Saud. After the meeting Saud returned to his father at Khufaisa and the Subah family went to Al Musannat and thence, to Kuwait. He was, of course, unable to say what was discussed. Does any of this correspond with your in formation. The dates are perhaps somewhat inaccurate but you know what Bedouin are with regard to cates, am ii dined tothink this is not very from the truth.Copy of secret demi official letter No.74, dated the 17th ^,pril 1931), from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Special Service Officer, Basrah* Thank you so much for your letter Ko.l/BS/34, dated 20th March which I am most ashamed to say I never an swered; (owing, believe me, to very heavy work) and again for your No.DO/14/115 of the 10th April lust received. 2. As your first letter is somewhat out of date now I will not reply to it. 3. Reference your second letter - Your news entirely correspond with what I was able to get here, though in view of later happenings I am now inclined to believe that'^- Shaikh Ahmea and party met Bin Baud himself rather than his son Saud. 4. The fact that Mohamed Yatim (Holmes confidential Jackal) accompanied Shaikh Ahmad on his 1st e»-fe journey ( 20th to 23rd February ) and again on the second journey (25th to 27th February ( was the most suspicious part of the whole busine s s• 5. If I am right, and the meeting with the King did take place, two things were certainly discussed: (a) Bin Bauds desperate need for money; (b) Oil questions. 6. Under (a) it is not beyond the bounds of possi bility that Bin Saud asked for a loan and in return// of fered some relief from the Blockade, f (b, 1 was discussed also with the intention of getting money, the presence of Mohamed Yatim was significant. 7. The following later events, I think, did much to prove the correctness of my earlier suspicions:- (a) On 18th March Bin Saud wired to Holmes to come to Jeddah at once if he wished to be a bidder for Nejd Oil Concessions:2 ed for Shaikh Alumd’s consumption* It points I think, to the fact that Shaikh Ahmad refused to supply money to Bin Saud at the meeting re fer x^ed to, unless the Blockade was declared en tirely off, which made the Bing decide on showing still less megpy to Kuwait than heretofore. 8. You heard, no doubt, that last month Bin Saud got £10,000 (or Rs.10,000) out of the Shaikh of Qatar and has now asked the people of Hassa to pay a years revenue ih advance. Salim al Muzaiyin went to Riath and back about the time you mention; he confirmed all points you mentioned.

From Lt•-Cloii© 1 H.K.r .iiiokson, C,X*E.j I.A.^ Polttical Agent, Kuwaitj To The Hon^le the olitical Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire . Oil Situation Report for 2nd Fortnight of April. Sir, With reference to your demi official letter No.232-S, of 17th March 1933 I have the honour to report that nothing of an unusual nature occurred during the first fort- ni^it of April, which coincided with the period jrfthat Major Holmes was absent in Egypt and Jeddah. Local Oil matters were entirely overshadowed by the arrival of l.M.S.E nterprise” and the Persian Gulf Squadron and the round of entertainments that had been arranged. My fortnightly reports on the Oil Situation will therefore start from 15th April — the present being ihe tirst of the series. I note that anything of an important nature should be telegraphed to you. I. ARRIVAL OF EHAN BAHADUR ABDUL LATIF BIN ABDUL JALIL. LATH DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMS AT KJL7AH 1 . ( a ) This individual, an elderly and very shrev/d person has been residing at the court of is Majesty : ing Bin Laud for the last 3 years in sort oi voluntary exile. He arrived back from Riath via Bahrain early in April, and after the King had proceeded to Mecca. Ostensibly/ ill r.- 2 - Ostensibly this person returned to visit his family i/?ho reside in Kuwait and also to make his peace with the Shaikh from whom he had, 3 years previously, parted under a cloud. In reality there is evidence to show that he knows more about Oil matters than he possibly cares to di vulge - whether he has actually been given any sort of mission by Bin Baud has yet to be proved, but his frequent references to the 'free hand' which the King has given him to compose certain differences with Kuwait, provided the results will benefit him (the King) financially, make one suspicious. On the other hand the ' orthy Khan Bahadur, who ostensibly, is very pro British, may have failed to obtain a good enough ^ob from the King in Saudiyeh, and had there fore decided to return to the home of his fathers to see whether he could make good by pushing A.P.O.C. interests as opposed to those of Major Holmes. e certainly en deavoured to enlist the sympathies of the A.P.O.C. on his arrival at Bahrain from Kejd, through their Agent Mr.Yusuf Kano,C.I•3., (Vide Bushire telegram 206,dated 27.3.33.) and outwardly appears very anti American and . ajor Holmes in particular. The above remarks are made in the form of a digres sion in view of what follows. (b) K.B.Abdul Latif, after two preliminary calls, at which no business was discussed, had a long interview, with me on 24th April 1933 and among other things made the following interesting statements connected with recent Oil events:- (1) Major Holmes ohly went to Jeddah to try and pet an Oil Concession in regard to the Kuwait Neutral Zone - this he (Ahdul Latif) had got to know privately through Mohamed tulaiman , Bin Baud’. Finance Minister. (2) Major Holmes was shrewd enough to-know that if- 3 - 1 *k a1 \* f he co ^ get Bin Baud to agree to givei/ consent would^o n° ne ’ then ^ Shaikh of Kuwaits consent would follow as a matter of course, for on Jy to express the wish to Shaikh iduiad that he also should grant his approval and v '? u f d fal1 lnt0 line. . bh ould (1) and (2) above happen, then Bln c 5 rtainly follow U P matters by urgtn K cession 1 'to ZL vT ? t0 , 8 ^ 6 1316 Kawait con! to A P or f eastern &amp; General Syndicate and not n?i A ?f‘°' C * * as , ^ w °nld he impossible to have one Rnntw lPany i. W 5 rk:in8 in the Kuwait Neutral Zone and another next door in Kuwait territory. Obviouslv both must go together. uivxousiy (4) pie Shaikh of Kuwaits journey into the Southern desert on 20th February and 25th February accom- panied by Major Holmes confidential Secretary was m v; etine the Ein « or son uad, the intention being to prepare the ground for the submission, by Holmes, of a draft proposal for a concession for the Neutral Zone. (See this Office confidential Report No.44,dated 5.3.33.)to Bushire° / .. ibis visit Holmes received a telepram (18 i,h . .arch) from Bin Saud inviting him to Jeddah. (6) ..he chaikh of Kuwait, who clearly at heart caxIous to_, give the concession both for Kuwait ^be ..eutral Zone to Holmes, himself originated Pf an , T an c suggested to Holmes that he should go for the Neutral Zone first, get Bin saud on his 3 hen S? 11 the latter to press him (the uhaikh of Kuwait) to grant the Kuwait concession to nimself (iiolmes) • The shaikh believed that with Bin Baud supporting him, he need not fear His Majesfr 9 s Government s subsequent annoyance, if he agreed to this form of pressure# (7) Only fear of His Majesty 9 s Government, or moral suasion from Bin Saud would ever make the Shaikh grant the Kuwait Oil Concession to the A.P.O.C. This being so H#M.S.Government must either bring quick pressure to bear on the Shaikh to grant the concession the way they wanted it to go, or the A.i#0.C f must forestall Major Holmes in the Neutral Zone, get the concession for that piece or territory from Bin Saud and get the latter to bring pressure to bear on the Shaikh, where Kuwait was concerned# As the first proposal could probably be ruled out it was absolutely vital to the A#P.0#C. that they should, through Longrigg in Jedda or other special representative (the latter for preference) go ' all out ' for a concession in the Neutral Zone without delay. (8) Lastly Bin Saud intended giving no answer at all to a|ry of the Jedda concession hunters till the end of May or early in June COMMENTS. In my opinion the above statements are worthy of Arab careful thought# They were put in typically/roundabout fashion- 4: - fashion, but I am nevertheless inclined to agree with most of what the late Director of Customs told me* It is so obvious to the mere onlooker that the Shaikh’s interests lie in the direction of the British company that nothing but a belief that it will be to his advantage politically, if the ^rnericans get into Kuwait could m ke him see things otherwise. This, I believe, is the crux of the whole business. One must not forget that the Shaikh’s mind, as that of all Nejdis, works by devious and tortuous routes. II. ARRIVAL BACK OK MAJOR HOLMSS. Major Holmes returned to Kuwait fran Jedda on 27th April 1955 (via Cairo and Imperial Airways). He called on the Agency on &gt;*2nd April 1953 and among other points, mentioned the following facts (a) He had been invited to Jeddah by Bin Saud. (This confirms my telegram Ho.58 of 23.3.53) • (b) He had not attempted in any way to get an Oil concession out of Bin Saud for the whole or part of Sau’diyah, but was after something else, which he could not divulge to me. (Obviously the Kuwait Neutral Zone)• (c) He had not seen the King, hut only the Finance Minister Mohamed ibn Suiaiman who appeared very grasping and did not impress. (d) He had only remained 3 days in Jeddah during which time he had submitted his official proposals, for the thing he wanted, in writing, and had addres sed these to the King direct. (e) He had met Longrigg, Twitch ell, Hamilton, and Philby (and Mrs.Phllby). The first he thought, would 'out no ice with Bin Saud as he had definitely the wrong personality': (His words). The second twotwo lie already knew. Philby he was much impressed with, especially his talented wife. (f) lie added that a Swiss and Italian were also at Jedda, both after M Qil n . (g) From Til at he had gathered whilst at Jedda, Bin Sand intended collecting all applicants’ draft conces sions, and would study these at his leisure. Bin Baud would, however, decide nothing till the end of May. He certainly would not tell the various concession hunters this. (This confirms what F.B.Abdul Latif said to me). (h) He (Major Holmes) was sending his wife home from Kuwait by first available air mail (probably 4th May) (This may presage an early departure on Holmes’s part also, and. rather suggests my belief that nothing will be settled till the cold weather sets in again). non grata” with Bin Baud, it would be unwise to suppose that for this reason his chances of getting a concession for the Neutral Zone from the King were poor. The astute Bin Baud, who always takes the ’long view f , might easily think it well worth his while to back Major Holmes in order to assert his influence over the Bbelkh of Kuw it by forcing him to give Kuwait also to Major Holmes. To the Arab world this would mean that Kuwait was under his (Bin Baud's) political control, much as Q,atar is believed to be. Buch a move would not necessarily be unpleasing to the Shaikh either, even though he might make some sacrifice financially. (b) Again, also it must not be forgotten that the shaikh, early in March, asked Major Holmes to prepare a new draft 'twin' conceso ) square miles would OOMMEKT (a) Although Major Holmes is supposed to be 'persona go to the Bri ti sh^6 V 1 also through Major Holmes* (See my report Ko*58,dated S3* 5*00 to the olitical Re si dent ) • Clearly the 400 square miles referred to is the Neutral Zone• This seems to confirm the belief of K.B.Abdul Latif, that the Shaikh of Kuwait actually had in mind, and had deliberately planned that Bin Saud should bring pres sure on him to give Kuwait to the Eastern &amp; General Syndi cate and not to the A*P.0*C., believing that His Majesty 1 * Government, who were always afraid of hurting Bin Saud f s feeling, would realize that the Shaikh was not to blame* No doubt he would arrange that Bin Baud should put the case clearly and firmly to His Majesty’s Government, that as the Neutral Zone had gone to Holmes, it would be clearly against his (Bin Sauds) interests if Kuwait went to anybody else* Holmes would then offer Kuwait to a ^British group and the Neutral Zone to the Americans* In reality it would mean the Americans getting both* other members of the family of **1 subah, are angry with their Ruler for delaying so long over this business* ihey all mould like to see the A.P.O.C. get the concession, but are powerless for reasons mentioned in my Confidential report No.36, dated 15.2.33. For ready reference I repeat 50 III. FEELING3 OF THE PEOPLE OR KU &gt;RIT* In the meantime the people of Kuwait and the below some of the observations which I made then. They still stand* Majesty’s Government. i courage 'co say that it is upto His Majesty’s Government to do- 7 - to do the advice giving• (c) None of the members of the Shaikhly House take any hand in the Government of Kuv/ait State and their counsel is not sought* (d) The Shaikh believes that it is not to his interest to have the A.i.O.C* in his country for 2 reasons: firstly * because he thinks they do not in tend to work the concession, inspite of all the A*P•C,G« say (This is olmes 1 s propaganda obviously) Secondly .because he thinks his independence might be threatened if he were to set up a concern backed by His I ajesty’s Government in his state. (Also obviously Holmes's teaching)* (ej The Shaikh would like to believe that as His Majesty's Government made no stand, when faced with the 'fait accompli' of the Americans getting into Bahrain, it is not very likely that they will make much fuss if the same Americans get into Kuwait* He, nevertheless, is not sure on this point in view of the many strong hints which he has received from different quarters, and being some what of a moral coward, he is nervous. (f) Major Holmes undoubtedly preadfees that if the Americans got into Kuwait they would be a powerful asset, since the Shaikh could always play them off against His Majesty's Government with the result that he would gain fairer treatment frcm both IRAQ and Bin Baud• IV. I enclose a copy of a secret D.Q, No.74,dated the 17th April 1933, which I recently sent to the Sjjecial Service Officer, Basrah. It may help to throw light on some more obscure points. I have the honour to be, Sir,- 8 - that he proposed seeing the Shaikh to-day (27.4«35.) and was going to ask that he (the Shaikh) should give him a letter to Bin Baud to the effect that if he (the Shaikh) gave the Kuwait concession to the Anglo Persian Oil Company he would also, as far as he was concerned, raise no objec tion to the A.P.O.C. taking out a concession for the Neutral UsruJUf Zone, and trusted that In Baud for his part^agreed also. This decision of Mr.Chisholm was come to before being aware of what I had written above. ‘OCO* V8S,Copy of secret demi official letter No.74, dated the % mh April 1933 from Lt.-Colonel H.B.P.Mclcson, Political Agent, Kuwait to Flight Lieutenant E.Howes.n.’c., Special Service Officer, Basrah. I hank you so much for your letter Ho.l/BS/ 34 , dated 20th March which I/Zst ashamed to say 1 never answered; (owing, believe me, to very heavy work) and again for your No.DO/U/llS of the 10th April just received. 2. is your first letter is somewhat out of date now I will not reply to it. 3. Reference your second letter - Your news entirely corresponds with what I was able to get here, though in view of later happenings I am now inclined to believe that Shaikh Ahmad and party met Bin Saud himself rather than his son Saud. 4. The fact that l ohamed Yatim (Holmes Confidential Jackal) accompanied Shaikh .Ahmad on his 1st journey (2§th to 23rd February) and again on the second journey (25th to 27th February) was the most suspieioikB part of the whole business. 5. If I c-m right, and the meeting with the King did take place, two things were certainly discussed: (a) Bin Bauds desperate need for money: (b) Oil questions. 6. Under (a) it is not beyond the bounds of possi bility that Bin Saud asked for a loan and in return offered some relief from the blockade. If (b) was discussed, also .with the intention of getting money, the presence of Mohamed ]fatim was significant. 7. The following later events, I think, did much to prove the correctness of my earlier suspicions:- (a) On 18th March Bin Saud wired to Holmes to come to Jeddah at once if he wished to be a bidder for Ngjd Oil concessions;2 (b) Holmes, Lombardi (Standar OilDirector) and K^ohamed Yatim flew to Cairo on 19th Larch; (c) Holmes and Mohamed Yatim went to Jeddah about 24th March, where they still are; (d) Abdul Latif bin Abdul Jalil recently re turned from Riath and told me that Bin Saud was absolutely determined to close the Nejd door to Kuwait, even tighter than it has hither to been closed and was about to set up a 'wire less' at Haff? r al Batin and strengthen his # frontier guards: The news was in the nature of a threat and intended for Shaikh Ahmad’s con sumption. It points, I think, to the fact that Shaikh Ahmad refused to supply money to Bin Saud at the meeting referred to, unless the Blockade was declared entirely off, which made the King decide on showing still les^ mercy to Kuwait than heretofore. 8. You heard, no doubt, that last month Bin Saud got £10,000 (or Rs.10,000) out of the Shaikh of Qatar and has now asked the people of Hassa to pay a year’s revenue in advance. the time you mention; he confirmed all points you mentioned o0o- Salim al Muzaiyin went to Riath and back about I&lt;■ . / Telegram Interdepartmental» From Secer, London.

POLI 'IT CAL AGENCY, KUWAIT. Dated the 3rd May 1933. From Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E., I.A., Political Agent, Kwait; To The Hon’hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHI R E , Sir, As ordered in your telegram No.346, dated 2nd May 1933, I have the honour to forward, herewith, a copy of my telegram No.84 of 30th April, duly paraphrased. 2. Regarding the last paragraph of this telegram - Holmes now tells me that he cannot get accommodation/on the west-hound plane leaving Kuwait on the 4th May, so will have to go on that leaving on the 11th May. Should however, he fail to get/seats then, he will go overland via Mosul and Istamhoul. This information, I think, should he telegraphed to London, provided you see no objection. 3. The latest Oil developments, as reported in my telegram No.84, are interesting and I think clearly show that the Shaikh, hy having been given the very free hand he has, is going further and further away from the direction in which His Majesty’s Government would like him to go, for the simple reason that he interprets ’enforced neutrality’ on my part as weakness on the part of His Majesty’s govern ment, with the natural result that he tends daily to get more and more under the control ol i.olmes and farther and farther/- 2 - r L 6 away from my influence. 4. This state of affairs is unfortunate, but so long as my hands are tied in the way they are, and I am also de prived of weapons with which to fight merican intrigue (I refer to the failure to settle the Kuwait blockade, the question of taxation of the Shaikh’s date gardens, and the Kadda^iiyeh Case), I see no great hope of the Shaikh being persuaded to look with greater favour on the A.P.C.C,, than he is at present doing. The contrary indeed, is the more likely contingency. 5. I have had occasion to mention before, that we are to-day dealing with a weak and as often follows, very obstinate individual in the shaikh of Kuwait, who though outwardly charming and pleasant, has all the steady cunning of the Nejdi; while on the other side of the picture the man who has got so much influence over him to-day, namely Major Holmes, is a person of strong character and most convincing personality. 6. There is little doubt in my mind that the Shaikh has been taught to believe(by ! ajor Holmes) orer a period of several years now, that (a) His Majesty’s Government cannot be entirely relied upon to fight his battles for him. (b) That His 1 -aJ.Bty's Government have let him down in the past, and will let him down in the future, because expediency largely governs policy to-day, (c) That .jnerican influence in Huwait ■!-? ^T^ented by an .jaerioan concern backed by the represented by an i United States of America) will insure him a new bom independence with greater security from the attacks and bullying tactics of Bin Saud and Iru^i; (d) That the A.P.O.C. with its British Government connection, will always be a dangerous company to have in his country. 7 it remains to see what will be the outcome 5./- 3 - t\AA y outcome of Holmes’s latest move. I personally think that some time ago he was given carte blanche by his American backers to 'top 1 ’ any offer made by the A.P.O.C. and that in the present case he has ’off his own bat’ offered a quarter of a million rupees; and wants now^ to Eo to London to get his offer ratified* 8. The Shaikh adroitly avoided giving me the figure offered hy Holmes when I asked him what it was - a minor point perhaps, hut one showing that he tries these days to keep me in the dark as far as possible, where Oil negotiations are concerned: one sees the hand of Holmes in this* X have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, u Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, luwait. 7 C ^ M vss.Telegram (Paraphrase) From Political, Kuwait, To 1.

No.7-Saving, Dated lltii ( received 24th ) April, 19,&gt;3. On the 9th April Holmes arrived. Philby gave me in strict confidence the following summary of the position of Oil negotiations. 1 . The Minister of Foreign Affairs’ previous demands, which aimed primarily at obtaining substantial annual payments and a lump sum of one hundred thousand pounds down hare been replaced by more onerous demands by King, ihe 'Iraq concessions' terms have inspired the new demands, the chief difference being that Saudi CJovernment now ask for promise of minimum royalty of two hundred thousand pounds on commencement of commercial exploitation as well as lump sum and annual payment. 2 . At the moment the Iraq Petroleum Company are trying to ascertain wnat will be tne minimum terms the Government will offer. They are unlikely to accept anything heavier than payment of lump sum and considerably lower annual payment than that demanded by Minister of Finance. Philby and I agree that there is email possibility of business being transacted. 3# The Standard Oil of California's representative returned from Kgypt on April 9th. Before his departure he had made an offer of lump sum down and a considerably lower annual payment tnan tnat demanded by Minister of Finance. H. is/is however so disgusted with the X&amp;test £&gt;siu.di proposals thatj in view of tne fact that his Principals show little eagerness to increase their offer, he refused to consider them and withdrew his earlier offer. 4* King, although still holding a low opinion of Holmes, has, in order to increase the field of competitors, agreed to his suggestion of a visit. Holmes claims that he is only bound to the Standard Oil of California in respect of concessions already obtained in the Persian Half; you have, doubtless, full particulars of these. He gives Philby to understand that his immediate object is to obtain I bn Saud*8 consent, so far as the King is co-interested with the Shaikh of Kuwait, to concession in Heutral Hone and that he and Standard Oil of California have a mutual understanding that provided they do not interfere with his operations in .Neutral Hone he will not interfere with them in Hasa. 5. Nevertheless Holmes had evolved schemes for Hasa, chief of which is to divide whole area into, say, 16 Blocks the big Oil Companies taking up seetionally as many as they wish and according to their holdings contributing payment approximating to the Minister of Finance 1 * s demands. Philby is of opinion that the Saudian Government might accept such a plan but he doubts if Holmes, at present, has the backing to carry it through. Owing to lack of first-hand information and being unable to cross-question any one concerned the above is passed on with reserve. It is probable that r^ing himself will direct negotiations which may enter latest stage of activities very shortly.)) CONFIDENTIAL.

His Excellency replied that nolmes had not yet prepared a draft copy, and probably would not do so, until after he returned to England (now fixed for 11th nay). 3. His Excellency further pointed out that Holmes could not have had time to prepare such draft, and that so long as both the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate and the A.A.O.C. were bidding against each other, it was not reasonable to expect either side to submit a new draft, each time they put a fresh bid forward: This part of the negotiations must of necessity be done verbally. His Excellency added that once the last bid had 4.2 had been made, and he (The shaikh) had decided to which company to give the concession, then would be the time for hi to order a draft to be prepared.

At the same time i am still of the opinion, as expressed in paragraph 7 of my despatch No.87, dated the 3rd May, that Holmes either offered the Shaikh a quarter of a million rupees on his own responsibility, having found out what his rivals had offered, or told the Shaikh that he was prepared to top the A.P.O.C. offer by Rs.50,000/- straight away, but required time to fly home to get his offer officially ratified by his principals,the Americans, lie clearly did not dare to make affirm offer' in writing. The Shaikh knew this and being favourable to Holmes, expres-r sed his willingness to let the matter stand at that. He immediately wrote to the local representative of the A.1.0.0. saying that their offer had been beaten, and asked ii they had anything further to say.

BRITISH LEGATION JEDDA, SAUDI ARABIA. 15th March, 1933 My dear Christopher, Your Confidential letter 8 723/12/91 of the 18th February about oil in Hasa crossed my private and confidential letter to you of the 28th February, The 'Iraq. Petroleum Company’s representatives arrived here on the 12th March. They are Mr.(? Ma^or ) Longrigg, a nice fellow, who was I understand formerly in the ’Iraqi Ministry of the Interior, and his assistant Mr.Mudarris, a young Syrian Moslem, educated at Oxford. Cairo gave them a sort of introduction to me by telegraphing to ask me to help over accommodation,e.g. with Gellatly Hankey. I found that the Government had arranged for them to stay at our new hotel and left it at that. ± had a long talk with Longrigg on the 13th March. I explained that I had no official concern with him but was willing to help him with general information. I gave him a good deal and gleaned the following facts in return, 1. The ’Iraq Petroleum Company have been in touch witt Hafiz Wahba and the present visit is the outcome of conversations with him. 2. The idea of the ’Iraq Petroleum Company is that they might get rights in Hasa, similar to those recently acquired in Qatar i.e. the right of prospecting for a limited time in/ A.Warner,Esq., FOREIGN OFFICEin return for a moderate periodical payment, e.g.monthly, but not to huy a pig in a poke 'by paying tig money at this stage for the right of extracting problematic oil* 3. Longrigg seemed to know leery little about the proceedings of Standard Oil of California and their representative here Mr* Hamilton, Twitchell’s ally. He was curious to knew whether I did* I was able to say truly that I know little or nothing but did not feel free to say what I believe to be the case, namely that the Sa*udi Government started by asking for a very large sum, too large for Standard Oil of California to agree to. 4, Longrigg confirmed previous information ot mine that Holmes is persona ingrata in Ibn Sard’s eyes. (I believe that this is because of the non-payment of certain dues claimed by the King when the former prospecting concession mentioned in the post scriptum to my letter of February 28th petered out). 5. Longrigg seemed to know very little about Philby s position in the matter. He asked me whether Philby, an old friend of his, would be a suitable person to take on a watching brief, when he himself left. I sail yes, if Philby felt free to do it, but was guarded as to the possible commitments which might deter him. I said that Gellatly Hankey might also be suitable, if it were merely a question of a watching brief, not of contro versial business, in handling which their need for standing well with the Sa'udi Government for general business purposes would hamper them. 6 . I gathered from Longrigg, what you doubtless know already, that the -Iraq Petroleum Company and Anglo Persian/Persian are so closely associated that the Anglo-Persian idea of approaching Ihn Sa’nd from the Persian G-ulf side merges in the present approach of the ’Iraq. Petroleum Company via Jedda. 7» The ’Iraq. Petroleum Company are not so far interest ed in oil on the Ped Sea side. So the stage is set, the dramatic persons being an avid Abdullah Suleyman, who thinks of oil in Hasa as already a marketable commodity; Twitchwell and Hamilton featuring Standard Oil of California; Longrigg and Mudarris, representing the ’Iraq Petroleum Company. So far as I can understand, Standard Oil of California is aa independ ent as any of the old Standard group, which was formerly headed by Standard Oil New Jersey but was broken up by the American anti-trust legislation. I gather that the interest of New Jersey and other American concerns in the •Iraq. Petroleum Company concession in ‘Iraq does not stand in the way of rivalry in the present matter between ’Iraq Petroleum Company and Standard Oil of California. ( As regards the minor possible personages mentioned at 5 above, I doubt very much whether Philby is definitely committed to any one but he has been seeing a ^.air amount/ of the two Americans and may be leaning that way. i do not think that Cellatly Eankey are at present concerned in any way, except that, as Shell agents they were told to do what they could for the 'Iraq Petroleum Company's representatives. It may amuse you to know that all the persons named above, except of course Abdullah Suleyman, met at my wife's reception on the 12th March; and that the representatives/representatives from abroad are all in the same hotel, a Government institution principally for high class pilgrim It has 'been suggested that we really now neeci a separate hotel for concession hunters. If I hear anything more definite, I will send a Savingram on the 24th March. Yours ever, (Signed) ANDREW RYAN. •*-**-*-x-CONFIDENTIAL . No. 500-S of 1933.

It may he worth observing that it is, in my opinion, un likely that Ibn Sa'ud can have gone to meet the Shaikh of Kuwait in February, though it would perhaps have been possible tor him to do so quietly, as he seems to have been in camp at Bawdat-al-Khafs for some weeks before March 19. I think there is more plausibility in the suggestion that the Shaikh may have met some personage in the King’s entourage. His Majesty’s cousin and brother-in-law, Sa’ud al ’Arafa, appears to be close to His Majesty and may be in his confidence for certain purposes. » 2. In the course of recent general conversation with Fuad Bey Hamza, I cited, as an example of Ibn Sa’uds un readiness to do as much as he might to please His Majesty's G-overnment, his action in trying to throttle Kuwait. Fuad Bey reacted with words which suggested that relations between this country and Kuwait were no concern of ours, to which I retortM that we had a special position in regard to Kuwait, a contention which Fuad Bey admitted. This conversation was in no sense a serious discussion; indeed it v/as almost persiflage, which I had no reason to record but which may be of some interest in the present connection. 3./ The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.3.

From Lt.-Colonel H*R.P.Dioicson, C*I.E., I*A., Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Hon r ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E . Oil Activities of Llajor Hoimies. Sir, With reference to my confidential despatch No. 104:, dated the 20th May and enclosures, I have the honour to report the following interesting incidents in connection with Major Holmes return to Kuwait from Bahrain on 17th May • 2. Major Holmes was met by his local representative Mohamed Yatim, who reraained closeted in a cabin with his chief for over an hour on the Steamer, before landing. 3. On Monday 22nd May Major Holmes called on me at the Agency, and after some polite commonplaces, I asked him what his plants were now that the Shaikh had suspended all Oil negotiations 'sine die'. 4. Major Holmes pretended to be greatly startled sharply asked what I meant! I replied that surely he knew seeing that I had it on the authority oi the Shaikh that his man Mohamed Yatim had telegraphed to him (Major Holmes) at Bahrain on 13th may and in a very lengthy telegram costing Rs.200/~ had told him of the shaikh s decision/- 2 - \...y v^v deoi si on* 5. * »a j or Holm as at onoe, and very angrily, denied that he had been told anything at all about the Shaikh's decision either by a telegram or letter or verbally: •n obvious ’falsehood' of course, seeing that he did not leave Batoain till the 15th ay, and even had he not re ceived his Agents telegram it was ridiculous to suppose that he had been in Kuwait from 17th Kay to the 32nd May and loarnt nothing. 6. Major Holmes went on hotly to assure me 'on his plighted 1 word that he knew nothing, and had been told nothing. He then seemed to lose his head altogether, ^ and started abusing the Shaikh, yourself, myself, the V British Government and above all the A.P.O.C., vowing vengeance at us all in rather scandalous manner. At any other time I would have turned him out of my house for saying half what he did, but as I hoped to get something out of him, I let him be. Vust wait', he said, 'and see what the American Government, who are behind me, will do”. He then shouted that he was not beaten yet, that he would get his concession in spite of all the world, and that then the American Government would enter the lists them selves and send a representative to Kuwait to ensure that their Oil Company got a fair do with the Ahaikh and with His Majesty’s Government. 7* Having volunteered this rather interesting piece of information, he suddenly calmed down, and I was able to tell him that his news that he had not been told anything, was doubly strange, seeing that I had an official letter from the -Shaikh, dated the 19th May con firming that he (the Shaikh) had informed both parties (the A.P.O.C. and the ISastern &amp; General Syndicate) that- 3 • V / that the Oil negotiations had been suspended, until such time as he (the Shaikh) decided to reopen them again. 8 # This seemed to sober Major Holmes completely, and he left me saying that he would discuss the matter with the Shaikh, who was dining with him. 9* The same evening at 8 p.m., and whilst the Shaikh was at his house, I received a note from Major Holmes, worded as follows:- Dear Dickson, The question of my being informed about the postponement of any discussions regarding the concession, is this way: His ihccellency informed my Representative, who wrote me to Bahrain, and he has now told me the position, which is in accordance with what you told me. I remain etc., 10. This being a very Isme way out of his 'lie”, in my opinion, I decided to see the Shalkh/on the 23rd May, at 9 a.m., so as to clear up the whole matter: His Excellency after listening to my story of Major Holmes 'denial” with interest, remarked, 'Not only did Holmes lie to you, but I made him admit to me last night at dinner, that he had lied: He could not do otherwise, seeing that Mohamed Yatim, his Agent, was at dinner also, and told me in Arabic, which Holmes does not understand, that he had sent him full details by wire to Bahrain on 13th May, of my decision and had fully explained the position on the steamer, to his chief'. 11. The Shaikh added that he had told Major Holmes that he had made a 'great and serious mistake', and further volunteered the remark that 'perhaps Holmes had been drink ing Brandy'. 12. X mention the above story, with reluctance, not because X wish to say anything disparaging about i^ajor Holmes Character, but to enable you to appreciate the Kuwait. 22nd May Frank Holmes. local/.5, - 4 - / 'XM') local situation, and the methods of the man we have to deal with. 13* The fact that n rogues sometimes fall out' even in the presence of kings, is also anusing. 14. The point of the above incident is clearly the following: Major Holmes came to see me (knowing all along that the Shaikh had suspended negotiations) in order to try, by a process of 'bluff n ,to find out,whether the Shaikhs suspension of the negotiations had been his own idea or had been insp ired or dictated by you as a result of your visit to London. Much capital would, of course, have been made, if the second al ternative had been correct: Clearly he was out to get some fom of admission out of me to use against both of us. Needless to say he failed. He lost his temper as a result of the news which I sprang on him 0 - that I had received a letter from the Shaikh, dated 4 days previous to his visiting me, confirming that he had informed Doth parties of the suspension of the negotiation s. 15. Major Holmes next effort was on 23rd, when he tried to borrow from me by letter and verbally, the'large scale' ma p of Kuwait, showing the Neutral Zone and North Bassa in detail*, which X made last year, a copy of which you possess. He used all the persuasive powers he possesses to this end, but naturally did not succeed. 16 .
