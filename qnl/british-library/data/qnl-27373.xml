The object of King’s Regulation No.l of 1918 was simply to ensure the compliance on the part of British subjects with the Arms Traffic Regulations of the Sultan of Muscat. In effect however, it not only made British subjects subject to these regulations but to 'any recognised local law or custom in Muscat” thus going directly against the first sentence of sub para (2) of Article 6 of the 1891 Treaty and Article 13 which gives British subjects the rights of ex-territoriality,since obviously if a British subject was made subject to any law passed by the Sultan ex-territoriality disappears. A further and serious defect in the King's Regulation in question was that in section 2 the Political Resident was not made the authority as in section 2 of King's Regulation No.l of 1935- of deciding what law should be applicable but merely whether an offence had been committed against such law. It seems obvious thatHis Majesty's Government do not regard as being in force the King's Regulation No* 1 of 1918, otherwise there would not have been any necessity for the issue of King's Regulation No. 1 of 1935♦ 3* For the reasons given above and to regularise the position, it is desirable to repeal the King's Regulation No.l of 1918 by publishing its disallowance by Government* The method of such publication in Muscat is merely to post a notice upon the Agency board for so many days so is not likely to cause comment. I propose taking this action, but before doing so, I shall be glad to have a copy of Government of India Foreign and Political Department's reply to Colonel Trevor's letter No.793 of 12th May 1920, enclosing a draft King's Regulation on local laws and customs, the last paragraph of which suggested that the Kind's Regulation of September 1918 should be repealed . It is presumed that a reply was sent though it is not traceable in the Residency records.Copy of a Memorandum jtfo.D.54l5-ii/35, dated the 26th August 1936, from the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, in the foreign and Political Department, to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.
