I write returning herewith of its perusal. It appears that tlie fuiid has invested (up to May, 1926) Rs: 10,400/- capital value of Lorn, 194&gt;-p5, fro.., funds remitted monthly from Bahrein to The Eastern Bank Ltd, Bombay. It will doubtless be remembered that early in 1927, I submitted that the monthly lodgment in The Eastern Bank Ltd in Bombay should be two hundred rupees, and not such balance as might be affected by the cost of transfer, and the rate of exchange; and I believe that this principle was approved. An adjusting lodgment .of Rs.^O/- was made in Mar. 5 th 1927, on account of differences. But since that date I see that the account has not been credited with two hundred iupees monthly, as I understood was to be done; hence I venture to suggest that a further adjustment becomes necessary up to May,1 928 , namely:^ Adjustment of opening lodgment of 25-8-24, of difference between Rs.l400/- and Rs: 158 O-I5-C, . Adjustment of 46 monthly lodgments up to the sum of Rs.200/- per month, . . Less contra adjustment of p^3-27., . • Balance of shortage of lodgments . Rs 18. 1. 0. 52 . 0 . 0. 70. 1. 0. 50. 0. 0. Rs : 40. 1. 0. ,.&lt;.ight ~ ^ ere ^ ore ven ture to apply for this adjustment to be made in Bombay, and for the approved arrangement to be in future carried out, namely lund may be credited monthly with Two hundred rupees exactly. Th ! s I suppose might quite easily be done by a transfer in Bombay from thaJSovergont of Bahrein's funds on current account there, and there woufflKf a aakim: in Banrein of the monthly cost of remittances. th . v ^ y 0 -/? 6vttr fa OF CUSTOMS.

Memorandum:- RHOEir Hz- ~/-3 3 With reference to my letter No. 512/lA dated Sentember 17, 1932, referring to the three provident funds of the British officials of the Bahrain G^rvern- ment. In t: is letter I requested that Mr. deGrenier l s provident fund si.ould be sold and re-invested in India 5/^ tax free loan. I asked that my holding s: ould be sold out and placed on fixed deposit for three months in Eastern Bank. Unfortunately in the first paragraph I stated that Mr. deGrenier and I wished to accept redemption, which was a mistake as by doing so I gather that we have lost the difference between the price of the stock at that time and par. I should be obliged if you would inform me whether Mr. deGrenier c s fund had been re-invested, also into wla account are the monthly instalments in his name being paid. Mr. deGrenier now asks whether his future monthly payments might be utilised to purchase Indian Postal Gash certificates which could be bought by the Political2 Agent, on behalf of the Hon r ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf who is the trustee. The limit tenable in the name of one person is 9s 10,000/- face value, which would cover his contri butions for about three years. After that time another form of investment could be contemplated. As regards my own provident fund I now request that it may be invested in the new free of income tax loan which is now standing, I believe, below par.
