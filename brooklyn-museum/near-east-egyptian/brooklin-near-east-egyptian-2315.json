One side of naos inscribed to the Divine Father and Steward of Min. Other side inscribed to wr.3s.t. (?). \r\nCondition: Originally fitted with handle, now missing. Base of both Hathor heads extensively chipped. Once covered in a thick black paint over which was a varnish completely obscured the inscription and many details of the carving.
