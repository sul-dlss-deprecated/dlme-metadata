Kemball also discusses negotiations to force the Al Ali tribe to withdraw from the conflict and return to Kenn [Kīsh] on the Persian Coast, and the necessity of forcing Shaeikh Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh to relinquish his claims on Bahrain, as being a prerequisite for the restoration of order in the region. Kemball also writes that his claim of negligence of duty against the British Agent at Bahrain, Hajee Jassim [Hajjī Jāsim], have been found to be groundless.The following enclosures are included with Kemball’s letter:1. Letter no.123 of 1854 (folio 71), a covering letter from Commodore George Robinson, Commanding Officer Persian Gulf Squadron, to Kemball, dated 4 August 1854, enclosing with it a letter (folios 72-73) from Lieutenant Alex Foulerton, Commanding Officer of the Honourable Company’s brigantine
                           Tigris, to Robinson, dated 1 August 1854. In his letter Foulerton informs Robinson that the brother of the ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Alli bin Kallifa [ ‘Alī bin Khalīfah] has blocked Dammām with over 400 boats and 5,000 men. Foulerton appends a note to his letter, sent by him to Muḥammad bin Khalīfah and dated 30 July 1854, in which he informs Shaikh Muḥammad that he is to assist him “should any force come to Bahrain to attack you”.2. Letter no.1B (folio 73) from Kemball to Robinson, dated 3 August 1854, informing Robinson of his intention to force the withdrawal of the Al Ali tribe from the Arab coast.

Letter no.123 of 1854 (folio 74) a covering letter from Robinson to Kemball, dated 8 August 1854, forwarding a letter (folios 76-77) from Foulerton to Robinson, dated 7 August 1854. Foulerton reports of his cruise to Dammām to issue letters to Shaikh Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh. Foulerton writes that the Bahrain Agent reports that Amir Fysul [Fayṣal ibn Turki], the Wahhābī ruler, is sending a further 4,000 men to assist Shaikh Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh, and that Humeed bin Mujdell has 500 men, which suggests a renewed attack on Bahrain is imminent;4. Letter no.2B of 1854 (folios 78-79) from Kemball to Robinson, dated 8 August 1854, requesting that Robinson be prepared to defend Bahrain, and by force if necessary. Kemball also writes that he has informed Shaikh Ali bin Sultan of the Al Ali tribe, that he has twenty-four hours to leave their present anchorage at Dammām;5. Letter no.3B of 1854 (folio 80) from Kemball to Robinson, dated 19 August 1854. Kemball informs Robinson that, in light of Shaikh Muḥammad’s agreement to desist from further attacks on Bahrain, and the Al Ali tribe having withdrawn from the area, it is not necessary for the
                           Tigristo stay at Dammām, though frequent patrols would continue to be necessary;6. Letter no.131 of 1851 (folio 81) from Robinson to Kemball, dated 21 August 1854, acknowledging receipt of Kemball’s previous letter, and stating that he will instruct Lieutenant Foulerton on the
                           Tigristo remain in the area, going to Bushire for supplies when necessary.The remaining enclosures constitute Kemball’s negotiations with Shaikh Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh, towards the latter withdrawing his present claim on Bahrain.
