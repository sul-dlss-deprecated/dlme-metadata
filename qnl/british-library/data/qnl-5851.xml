It is presumed that his coming has for its purpose evil objects which he is attempting to carrv out in accordance with the encouragement of others. It is understood that the man in question and his party are endeavouring to buy their needs and equipment in Kuwait and Bahrain. I therefore wish to communicate this infoimation to Your Excellency, privately, trusting that you qould be good enough to tpke the necessary measures with the authorities concerned, to prevent the occurrence of trouble on the frontier.

(Copy in files P.G.13,1/1 and IV/ 6 ) P.Zf 4173/33 India Office, Whitehall, S. M 14th July 1933. Dear Giffard, You will remember asking me a few days ayo about the precise status of the Koutral Zone between Najd and Kuwait. I am sorry to have been so long in sending you a reply, but wo have been very much pressed here. 2. The status of Kuwait was the subject of consi derable discussion in the period before the war. An agreement regarding it was finally reached with Turkey and a Convention signed to give e feet to that Agreement on the 29th July 1913. Under this Agreement the territory of Kuwait was recognised as an autonomous caza of the Ottoman Empire; the Ottoman flag was to be flown by the Shaikh who was, however, to have the right to insert a distinctive emblem in the corner; he wa; to continue to be a Turkish Zaimakan and his successors were to be appointed to a similar position by the Ottoman Government; the full administrative autonomy of the Shaikh was recog nised within the territories of Kuwait proper, the limits of which were defined by the red circle on map No.2 appended to P.G.13; within the surrounding area (included within a green line on the map) which was occupied by tribes recognised as dependant on him, he was, as in the past, to continue to levy tribute and to perform the administrative duties of Turkish Kaim akan. and in both H.P.W, Giffard, bsquire, Petroleum Department, Board Of Trade, Dean Stanley Street, s.Y. i .-(£)- both regions Turkey undertook to abstain entirely from any interference. This convention though initialled, had not been ratified on the outbreak of the war. S. The boundaries between Kuwait and Ngjd were finally settled at the Oqair Conference of November - December, 1922. As stated in paragraph 34 of the £emoran- $* dum on Kuwait in P.G-.13 ”it was recognised that the power of the Shaikh of Kuwait in the desert was much less than it had been at the time of the conclusion of tho Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 1913, and a settlement was finally reached under which the frontier 3 K£xii 5 KXXK±i;*x±s as between Nejd and Kuwait starts from the junction of \ the ^adi-al-Aujah with the Batinjon the west, running l thence (leaving Kiqai to Nejd) in a straight line to the junction of the 29th parallel of latitude with the red- semi-circle on the rap attached to the draft Anglo- Turkish Agreement and reproduced in Map No.2 appended to P.G*13, thence following the red semi-circle to the sea south of Ras-al-Qulaiah. The southern boundary of the recognised territory of Kuwait is defined above. It was simultaneously agreed that the tract of country bounded on the north by the above line, on the west by the Bhaqq, on the east by the sea and on the south by a straight line running eastward from the Shaqq in the west through Ain-al-Abd to the sea north of Has-al- Kishab should be recognised a© common to the two states of Nejd and Kuwait, who were to enjoy equal rights in it until such time as a fresh agreement should be arrived at between them regarding it through the good offices of His Majesty’s Government”. 4. The geographical area of the Kuwait Nejd Neutral bone is as defined in the preceding paragraph. As-{3)~ Aa regards its status, Hejd and Kuwait have equal rights in it pending the conclusion of a further agreement, and neither party, therefore, can grant &amp; concession without the consent of the other, ab regards its earlier history it is, I think, failry clear from paragraph 2 above that in the pre-war period the area now included in the Keutral Zone was predominantly urn or Kuweit control. It was quite definitely not under the control of Xbn Saud, whone active interest in it dates from a much later period. It would, X think, be reasonable to contend in all the circumstances that for the imrposes of international oil agreements affecting 'Kuwait” or ‘the Sultanate of Kuwait' the Keutral one can proper■y be regarded as covered by either of those terms. b.

The King in fact naively says 'I made the suggestion that you should raise your Kuwait Customs rates to the level of those of Saudiyeh, for no other purpose than to make both our countries one in small and great matters, see ing that you and your people are also Mej&amp;is and of our own flesh and blood.

In other words the King would apx^ear to frankly offer Kuwait one of two courses: (a) To come under his suzerainty once for all and win peace and contentment; or (b) To continue being blockaded, and live f&amp;ce to face with ruin, as the eventual prospect. 4 # Under the surface there also is a cunning appeal to the Shaikh and the people of Kuwait to remember that family ties are worth more than nationalistic ideas, and that as Hejdis by blood they should appreciate the situation and not f kick against the pricks 1 any longer. 5. Nevertheless on the whole the King’s reply is very reasonably worded.

U.B. ——ooo——THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5TH TO DISCUSS RELATIONS BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY* S GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE SHEIKH OF KOWEITo The following were present at the meeting: Mr. G.W. Rendel, (in the Chair) ( ( Foreign Office Mr. K. R. Johnstone ( Sir A. Ryan, His Majesty*s Minister at Jedda. Lieutenant-Colonel T.C. Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mr. J.G. Laithwaite, India Office, The meeting had Before it Sir Andrevf Ryan^s note of the 16th August, regarding the attitude of King Ihn Saud towards Koweit (see Appendix A). MR. RENDEL outlined the present political situation of Koweit. The Sheikh was tied to His Majesty's Government hy his treaty engagements, hut at the same time was being courted both by Ibn Saud and by Iraq. It was clear that the Sheikhdom was not in a position which in the ordinary way would enable it to stand alone either as a political or as an economic entity and that it must therefore depend on some stronger Power. He understood that it was the policy of His Majesty*s Government, in view of the strategic importance of Koweit, not to allow it to be absorbed by any foreign Power, but, so far as was pobSible, to maintain tueir present treaty relationship with the Sheikh„ MR. LAITHWAITE/2a MRo LAITOTAITE suggested that Koweit was at the present moment of more vital importance to His Majesty's Government than it had 'been at any time since it had hulked so promin ently as the terminus of the Baghdad railway before the war* This was the result first of the development of the air route to India and Australia 5 v/hich had made the Gulf as important imperially from the air standpoint as was the Suez Canal for naval reasons, and secondly owing to the expira tion of the mandatory regime in Iraq and the uncertainty of the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with that countryo So long as Iraq had been under British control, there had been a natural tendency to give it prior con sideration and the less important question of Koweit had been kept comparatively in the background* But now that Iraq had attained full independence, the position was changed and Koweit had once again assumed major importance. Geographically, Koweit occupied a key position at the head of the Persian Gulf, and one from which the Gulf could be controlled* In the event of war we could probably safely assume that Koweit would bo on our side and her territory would afford us a base of operations of definite value to the use of which, on the assumption in question, no objection could be raised on the ground that we were violating her neutrality* Further, with the development of the Arabian coast air route to the East, Koweit was likely to prove more and more vital as a station on that route, especially if our relations with Iraq should at any time become so strained that we were unable to rely on the use of the Iraqi aerodromes for the purposes Qf that route. COLONEL FOWLE/5 k COLONEL FOWLE cuggosted that in point of fact it night one day he possihle to avoid the use of Iraq altogether and fly direct from Palestine to Kov/eit ; as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route in creased, MR. RENLSL concurred with Mrs Laithwaite’s estimate of the position as regards Iraq. In view of recent events in Iraq it was possible that our whole relationship with that country might have to be modified and he considered that both the future of the Anglo-Iraqi treaty and of the position of the Royal Air Force in Iraq must be regarded as doubtful. On the general point at issue, he observed that one of the main points to be borne in mind was the fact that Koweit was not naturally inde pendent from either the geographical or the economic point of view. It v/as a port without a hinterland, cut off at present by the Iraqi and Saudi frontiers from the territory which it would naturally feed, and at present denied free communication with the country behind it. Moreover, even its present trade might be jeopardised - &lt;•. ™ V» by the development of the Saudi port at Ras Tanura under the auspices of the American oil concessionaires on the Hasa coast. V/liat was even more important was that its fresh-water supply was not derived from its own territory, but had to be imported from Iraq. It was for considera tion therefore whether it Y/ould in fact be practicable for His Majesty^ G-overnment to maintain the independence of Koweit as against its neighbours, at any rate on the present basis of a rather loose and ill-defined dependence on His Ma j e s ty f s Government, COLONEL FOMLE/COLONEL FOWL'S cuggssted that in point of fact it / night one day he pocsiole to avoid the use of Iraq altogether and f]y direct from Palestine to Koweit ; as the range of the aircraft using the Arabian route in- creasedo M.

MR, RENDER agreed that both Iraq and Saudi Arabia were in a position to exert strong pressure on Koweit, This being so ? the rivalry between them over Koweit was likely to increase, uniess of course Saudi Arabia disintegrated. The present position of Koweit between these two States was weak cUid Sir Andrew Ryan's note showed how powerful an attraction Inn Saud could exert 0 Tne question therefore was whether His Majesty's Government would not he Y/ell advised to develon and tighten up their own relations with Koweit in order to strengthen its position,, It had in fact been suggested that it might he more advantageous to convert our present treaty relationship into a definite protectorate, on, for instance, me uiumogy of the Hadramaut, which was now regarded as part of tne Aden Protectorate but w r here our treaty relationship with tne local rulers and obligations to afford them protection had ^ uuyahing looser than those we had towards Koweit, would not a Protectorate ensure Koweit more effectively against absorption than the present attempt to maintain the oheikhdon as a kind of political vacuum in the Persian Gulf, NAITHWAITE drew attention to three points:- (a)/(a) At present -the obligations oi His Majesty's oveminent to Koweit were represented by their undertaking o grant 'good offices' in respect of Koweit under the 399 Agreement, by their premise of 1907 that 'the town of &lt;owelt and its boundaries belong to Sheikh Mobarak-us- 3uba, Buler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him' and isir undertaking of 3rd November 1914 that Koweit, in ne event of a victory over the 'lurks, would be recognised / us as an independent principality under British protec- Lon. Th*y ware thus very general in terns, and, in ac- ordanee with our normal policy on the Arab littoral, lich dated from &amp; period in which it was possible to ’oteet a e®a port by action from the ssa, but not to ■ford effective help inland, we had consistently ideaveured to limit cur obligations save as regards ;ood officss' to Koweit town and the immediately ad ding area, Recent expsrif-cncc* had, however, shown that i cases of intervention from outsido it was in fact jeessary to give the Sheikh, at cur discretion, and on ir own terms, a measure of active assis tance up to the mit of his frontiers and with the development of aircraft ie problem of inland defence was now less difficult. This ■s to seme extent a strengthening of his strict treaty &gt;aitlon, as also possibly an extension of our strict treaty 'ligations. (b) With regard to the suggested establishment of a ■otectorata it was necessary to consider what the reactions the Shaikh would be, and also what effect the proclama-- .on of a Protectorate might have on the other Arab rulers the Gulf. It woul^ in any case be wiser not to make an ert proclamation of this nature since both in Bahrain and i Qatar and along the Trucial Coast it would probably rouse apprehensions.. • »6. apprehensioos and might even cause the local Sheikhs to turn away from Ilia Majesty’s Government and consider suh- ml thing themselves to Persia or to Ibn Baud. (c) Tiie basis of His Majosty^s Government's present treaty relationship with Koweit was unsatisfactory. In the first place it did not rest, as was the case with Bahrein, Muscat and the Trucial SheikhdOTs, on a long series of formal treaties with ’the Shsikh dating back for over a century or, in the case of Q^tar f on a compre hensive treaty, but ms baesd only m a comparatively brief correspondence exchanged between the Slieiklis and Hj. y Ms» J esty ’ s Go v 3 a,'nm sd t u ^in w x ^ ci sd an tiie reciprocal eng&amp;genGats, still prastam&amp;ly lindLug since th*y bad not been abrogated, entered into in connaxiaa with the lease of Bunder Shwaikh in ISO?; secondly there were certain gaps, c.g. we had no slavery agreement wiih Keweit. It migat, he suggested, he possible to .till in the gaps left by this correspondence and tighten cur coatrol in that W. An example was gur reemt request to the Sheikh for certain undertakings in regard to air facilities in his Sheikhdom, one result of which wosrid bo to conceertmts effective control of such facilities, whether military or civil, in 'the hands of His Majesty's Goveraeact. Another instance was the rectat proposed riiaendment of the Koaeit Ordsr-in-Council so as to place rsspcjasi'cility for juris diction over non-Moslem foreigners in hands of His Majes'iy^s GovsmKifaat. A gradual tightonieg of our control of this character, particularly pursued as a deftoits policy on all convenient occasions, would, he thought, at ones avoid the difficulties involved in establishing &amp; formal protectorate and would make it very much simpler. COLGNEl....&lt;r' 7. COLO TEL FOWLS expressed the view that there did not seem to he any intermediate position possible between a treaty relationship with the jheikh on the present lines and a full Protectorate, The Sheikh would certainly be unwilling to agree to the sheikhdom becoming a formal protectorate, and prima faci&amp; he (Colonel Fowle) was not much in favour of it 0 He agreed, however, that it would be advisable on suitable opportunities, to try to tighten up our control over the Sheikh. On being questioned whether he did not consider that our restricted nosition vis-a-vis of the Sheikh in regard to the Koweit oil concession indicated the essential weak ness of our treaty position, he replied that our difficul ties in that case had been due rather to the special undertakings given to the United States Government in that ■matter than to any weakness in our norma], control over the Sheikh under the treaty engagements. Had we been able, without violating our pledges to the United States Govern ment, to tell the Sheikh that we required him to give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company he would ha.ve done so. MR. RENDEL drew attention to the fact that in the event of serious misgovernment by the Ruler of Koweit such as orejudicially to affect foreign citizens in Koweit we might find ourselves in a difficult position vis-a-vis the foreign power concerned, MR. LAITHWAITE said that on this noint he thought that Bahrain might be regarded as loc us classic us , We had for many years put up with a considerable degree of misgovernment by Sheikh Isa 0 But when conditions at last in our view became intolerable we did not hesitate to intervene and to depose the Sheikh. ThereMH, hinNDEL 0. Taere were obvious arguments--for doing so, for were we not to intervene when misgovernment had reached a certain pitch it would be most difficult for us to justify a re fusal to allow foreign governments which mig^t be affected to take steps to protect the interests of their nationals. e did not think that there need be any apprehension in the case of F oweip that we would fail to bring pressure on a Sheikh who was abusing his position, once it became necessary to do so. The case for early intervention would probably be stronger now that the Gulf was so much more in the public eye. The meeting then went on to consider relations between Ibn Gaud and Koweit. SIR AIDITSW RYAH stated that he had been impressed by the apparent weakness of His Majesty's Government's position vis-a-vis of Ibn Baud with regard to Koweit. His ! ajesty's Government were not strongly placed, when it became necessary to warn Ibn Baud to keep his hands off Koweit, since they were committed to maintain ing that Koweit was technically an independent State. A case in point had been the Saudi intrusions into Koweit territory referred to in paragraph 3 of his note, when Saudi officials had performed acts of authority within the limits of the sheikhdom. COLO EL FOWLE pointed out that in fact our treaty engagements did entitle us to prevent foreign Powers from dealing direct with the sheikh. Ibn Saud had certainly been informed of the special relations existing between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government. Speaking generally, he added that infact little trouble was likely to be experienced with foreigners in Koweit,so long as it remained a Beduin town reded by a Beduin Sheikh and not, like Bahrain, p, relatively cosmopolitan commercial centre. If,however,oil were discovered v/ithin the uheikh- aom, it was possible the/t difficulties might arise.we O € O 3o MR. RENDEL pointed out that the Arabian air route was likely to develop quickly. If Iraq were to adopt an anti' foreign polrcy, and Koweit became correspondingly more important as a centre of international traffic, other countries might well wish to take advantage of the facilities there. We might well find many foreign Powers becoming increasingly interested in Koweit. We could not have it both ways, and should sooner or later have to define our position. His Majesty's Government ought, therefore, to orient their policy definitely either towards the greater independence of the Sheikhdom or towards a tightening of their own control. MR. LAIIHWAITE agreed and added that, in his view, our policy should be directed towards a closer control, but that it was undesirable to hasten any overt declara tion of full control, such as the establishment of a protectorate would be. Such a declaration might well frighten the Sheikhs of Bahrain and of the Trucial Coast and do more harm than good,. The policy to be followed was, therefore, one of occasional minor adjustments, as those became necessary, tending to increase, or at any rate not to relax, our control over the Sheikhdom, Reverting to the question of Saudi-Koweiti relations, SIR AMfSEW ryam drew attention to the toleration extended by His Majesty's Government to direct correspondence on business matters between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud, This, no less u nan the independence formula, placed us in a weak position in defending Howell, and the correspondence in question was of such long standing that it was difficult no'.*/ fox' us to take the line that Ibn Saud should writs to us rather than to the Sheikh. What was desirable was that1C. v. r o should he able to tell Ibn Saud openly that v/e were responsible for defending the Sheikh's interests in any given dispute, MR, LAITHWAITE said that the explanation of the system of direct correspondence between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud was, he thought, that it dated from a time when the latter was not so important a ruler as he had since become and when we had taken the view that it was un necessary to take too strict a view of correspondence between Sheikh and Sheikh, That position was now changed, and reconsideration seemed desirable. Ibn Saud was well aware both that His Majesty 5 s Government conducted the foreign relations of Koweit and that the oheikh ±1 ao. unoeroaken certain obligations towards us.. He agreed that it was now necessary to exert stricter control over the correspondence in question and to emphasize our own special position in Koweit vis-a-vis of Ibn Saud more definitely than had been the case while iraq was still under British control. He suggested that v/e might; (a) check Ibn Saud when he appeared to be presuming too far with regard to Koweit - a policy which we were in fact now prepared to follow in regard to the Saudi-Koweit blockade, and (b) enforce stricter regula tions on the Sheikh in the matter of direct correspondence GO LONE .u vOWLE agreed. Such action would show both ohoheikh ano. Ibn Saud that we considered the Sheikh to se uno-Sj. cut direction. If we did not take some such s^ep as oh is r v/e might he in danger of finding ourselves .i.aced with the results of a kind of conspiracy between the Sne.t.xh ano. j~bn Saud, We ought, therefore, to write to the 0 • athe Sheikh in the sense that we noted that his private correspondence with Ihn importance and tell him Baud had assumed that that ccrres an increasing pondence must now cease a Mo HENDEL concurrede A straightforward control of this nature would he easier to maintain and would prevent a repetition of such incidents as the letter in which Ihn Baud had recently tried to detach the Sheikh of Kuweit from his connexion with His Majesty 5 s Government, SIR A. RYAN also concurred* and drew attention to the success with which Ihn Sand was spreading the idea that he might naturally ahsorh Koweit and was hound to do sc sooner or later 0 He pointed out that such an idea could never have prevailed to the extent to which it had, if His Majesty’s Government had equally definitely made known their own special position with regard to Koweit c The meeting then discussed what point in the corres pondence between the Sheikh and Ihn Baud could most suit ably he taken up in connexion with the reprimand which it was proposed to address to both parties 0 MR* LAI.TIM,AITS suggested that if it were discovered that the Sheikh had committed himself to Ihn Baud in regard to the grant of an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, this might he an excellent opportunity for checking him. The question then arose what action could he taken if the United States Government, in dealing with whom His Majesty 5 s Government had consistently emphasized the Sheikh’s independence, were to produce communications from him regarding the grant of a concession in the Neutral Zone 0 It was, however, agreed that His Majesty's Govern* rnent could demonstrate from the Sheikh’s treaty engagements that he had not been entitled to make any such grant with-without our knowledge and consent. Eventually it was agreed that the roost suitable occasion for the proposed representations to the Sheikh and Ibn Baud would be Ibn Baud's letter suggesting terms for the settlement of the Saudi blockade of Koweit and warning the Sheikh against His Majesty’s Government c At the conclusion of the meeting SIR A. RYAN raised the question of the pressure which might be exerted upon Ibn Baud in regard to the Saudi blockade of Koweit. This blockade had one of two purposes, either to complete the economic strangulation of Koweit and lead to its complete absorption in Saudi Arabia., or else the safeguarding of Saudi economic interests„ His Majesty’s Government could not possibly allow the first of these alternatives. The question therefore was what real force there was in Ibn Saud’s suggestion that his own purely economic interests required the maintenance of the blockade. COLONEL FOWLE suggested that we might well revert to the Sheikh's proposal that Ibn Saud should have customs posts at a given place along but outside the Kov^eiti border, and unut this mightj if necessary, be coupled with a system of manifests for Koweiti-Saudi trade. He gave it as his opinion that even if Ibn Saud were to develop Ras Tanura, possibly with American help, this port was not likely to compete seriously with Koweit, which served quite a different hinterland, nor was there any port between the Koweit area and the Ras Tanura area which could be successfully developed as a rival to Koweit. COLONEL FOWLE suggested that on his return to the Gulf • • e.o Gulf on 16th October he should discuss the situation with Colonel Dickson, Political Agent, Koweit ? who had great experience of the sheikhdom; ha the light of the conversa tions at the present meeting, and should submit a compre hensive report. It was agreed that this course should be adopted, and that in the light of the Hesident’s report and of the conclusions of the present meeting the question of future policy in Koweit should be discussed if necessary in the kiddle East Official Sub-Committee 0 The conclusions of the meeting were as follows: (1) That in dealing with Ibn Baud, His Majesty's Government should increasingly emphasize the closeness of their relations with the Sheikh 0 (2) That the Sheikh sho’ald be told that his personal correspondence with Ibn Saud on official matters was to cease c (3) That the issue of the Saudi blockade of Koweit should be taken up with Ibn Saud by His Majesty’s Govern ment on the basis of their obligation to protect the interests of Koweit. (4) That on receipt of the despatch promised by Colonel Fowle the whole question of relations between His Majesty’s Government and Koweit might suitably be referred for further discussion to the Middle Cast Official Sub committee; to which a note should be sent recording the points discussed at the present meeting, and setting forth the arguments for and against the possible declaration of a protectorateoS ir u-jidrew 'iyan , 14. Ibn Baud's attitude tov/ards Kov/ait o I have been turning over in ny mind for some time the possibility that it may be a definite object of Ibn Saud‘s policy to reduce Kowait to a position of dependence on him somewhat similar to that of nsir from 1926 to 1950. This is in the nature of a pure speculation but it is a speculation so interesting that I think it worth while to collect the principal data bearing on it. It must be admitted at the outset that, if Ibn Saud had such an idea in his head, he would realise the need for great caution lest he should indispos His Majesty's Government. His only formal obligation towards the latter is that contained in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda but he understands very well the implications of the words therein ,? who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Government H . On the other hand he has seen His Majesty’s Government tolerate direct correspondence on business subjects between him and the Sheikh of Koweit. He might think that they would not react over strongly if he and the Sheikh confronted them with the fait accompli of a political deal, 2o Apart from the correspondence, of which we have knowledge there has been other intercourse between the rulers, notably the Sheikh's visit to Riadh in 1952, the secret messages brought by Ibn Sand’s confidential messenger to the Sheikh early this year and the Sheikh’s mysterious dashes into Mejd last February, when Colonel Dickson surmised that he had gone to meet some high Saudi personage, possibly Ibn Saud himself. 3. I may interpolate, as a minor indication of Ibn Sand’s attitude, a reference to two occasions on which it has been suggested or hinted by his Ministry of Foreign Affairs that His Majesty'sl ajesty's Gov ,rnrient should not concern theuselves with afiuixS between Saudi Arabia and Kowaii. I class then as minor, oeoauso this position has never been categorically asserteu. rhe xiist was when, in reply to a coaplaint of nine regarding Saudi encroachments on Kovait territory, which hid perturbeu his bajesty's Government, the reply was in effect: 'Sorry you navo been perturbed. You need not have been if the matter had b„en pursued through An. Kafisi'. On another occasion buad hey, in rather light conversation, asked me why we concerned ourselves in natters between his Governnoat end j-.Oi.'ait. 4. ahe -oersonal relations between the two rulers are peculiar, Ibn Gaud grew up at I,ovait and it is sometimes said that he has shown himself ungrateful to his former hosts. It is saiu ey others, I do not know on what precise grounds, that wubarak treated Ibn baud very badly. nyhow, through all the i elation., there runs a thread of old friendship, however flimsy and however frayed by frequent friction over raids, the emoargo and so on. It has helped towards the settlement of minor questions. It has not deterred Ibn baud from emoremg une embargo on trade but the embargo on trade has not aesxroyeu tne Sheikh's ostensible friendliness towards Ibn Sand, rhey are ^ hjeades ,kabo' .s I once wrote and they both corbine some real friendship for bis mjesty’s Goverment and a nealthy ion of them with a good deal of fundamental mis'crusi. 5. idie point of my theory or speculation is that, n wie Sheikh of Aowait were at all willing to be '..sirized', Ibu Saud could make the proposal quite attractive on me following liuoo, if I may venture to put into his mouth the sort of language he could use:- (a) 'You arc not really independent, ny dear felloe, fou 'are under the thuao of the .nglisn. - ne^ miignt cuinex you atany moment or even present yon to Iraq, If you must le lependent on some one, why he dependent on those untrustworthy imperialists, when you might depend, without being exactly dependent, on a man like me, old friend, fellow Moslem, fellow Arab and the one big independent man in Arabia'. (b) 'I don't like squeezing you, I really don't, with that embargo. As things are at present I have to think of my own interests. But if your interests were mine, we could easily have an understanding, n sort of 'Zollverein' as they say: same duties levied in our ports; free competition between yours and mine; free trade over our land border. 'That have the English done about it? Nothing, because they cannot get at me. Sois mon frere, et je te fais vivre. Sois le leur, et je te tue '. (c) 'I should not mop you up of course. You would rule your state under an understanding with me. Indeed, if you were in with me, I might recognise a sort of influence of yours over those three Lost Tribes that you always want back. Look at how I treated the Idrisi. I made a sensible agreement with him in 1926. lie remained a ruler with t ribal influence. I did not take charge in his country, until he got into such a mess that he asked me to in 1950. I did not hit him on the head until the poor mutt thought he could try conclusions with me in 1932.

TOWARDS THE SHEIKH OP KOWSlT. ,.6535/33. A. Nature oi the undert ak ings p-iven . By the Agreement of 25rd. January 1699 His Majesty’s Government formally assured the Sheikh ‘'of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors, so long as you, your heirs and successors scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said Bond', under which the Sheikh had pledged himself, his heirs and successors, not to receive the agent or representative of any power or government at Koweit without the previous sanction of the British Government and not to cede, sell, lease, or mortgage, or give for occupation or for any other purpose, any ^portion of his territory to the government or subjects of any other power without the previous consent of His Jhajesty* s Government. p. By Article IX of the Secret Agreement oi 15th October 1907 for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore, the Political Agent intimated that he was 'duly authorised on behalf of the precious Imperial English Government to promise and do hereby promise that the town of Koweit and its boundaries likewise belong to Sheikh Mo barak~us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and to his heirs after him, and that ail Sheikh Mobarak’s arrangements in the matter of customs etc. and all his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mobarak-us-Suba, Ruler of Koweit, and of his heirs after him, and...' In consideraticn of this promise the Sheikh undertook not to levy customs aues in excess of 4% on goods imported or exported by 'the subjects of the aforesaid English Government' save with the approval of that 'Go ve rnment. 3/5. The undertakings given in writing to the sheikh on 3rd November 1914 in return for hi Turks contained an assurance that s cooperation against the i( Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.^ Construction of the unde r takings given to the’ Sheikh .' 4. As will be seen, the engagements entered into by His majesty's Government with the Sheikh are in rather general terms and it is perhaps desirable briefly to record the construction placed upon them at various times by His Maje sty’s Government. 5* In 1901, when there was a Turkish threat to Koweit the Viceroy was informed (secretary of State’s telegram No.45 of 4th December 1901, p,1417/01) that this 'appears to constitute a distinct violation of the Sultan*s promise' (to respect the status quo) 'and in these circumstances His Majesty's Government are prepared to support the Sheikh and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships upon Koweit. The sheikh should not leave Koweit and should continue to observe his engagement with us'. The assurance given is clearly limited by the words 'in these circumstances' to this particular case. Moreover, it is not conditional on and is independent of the sheikh's observance of his Agreement of 1899. 6* On 21st March 1902 Lord Lansdowne, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, ho a Memorandum on the situation in Koweit remarked that our obligations towards the Sheikh were 'as ill-defined as the boundaries of his Principality. We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British 'protection'; on the other hand we once made him a present of £1,000, and promised him our 'good offices' whatever that may mean. When we made this promise we were, I feel no doubt, thinking/- vJ - / / h thinking of Koweit proper, if there is such a thing,and not of Boohyan or other outskirts over which the Sheikh has rights of one sort or another...We might it seems to me explain (1) to the Porte (3) to the Sheikh, and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately interested the objects of our policy. I should he inclined to say that our engagements to Koweit do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Sheikh to our approximate definition of that district...' 7. Later in 1902 it was reported that Ibn Rashid was making energetic preparation for attacking Ibn Baud, then the Sheikh of Koweit 1 s friend, and the Sheikh was warned not to take any action likely to bring him into difficulties with either Nejd or Turkey. About the same time the sheikh informed us that Ibn Rashii had with him a gun presented by the Turks and asked for a gift of 2 or 3 guns which it was understood were wanted for Jehara to protect Koweit against land attach. The Viceroy (telegram No.39 of 3rd October 1902) proposed to reply that the Sheikh's request could not be granted, 'but that provided he c omplied with the injunction conveyed to him in pursuance of your telegram of 4th December 1901 (see paragraph 5 above) His Majesty's Government v/ould charge themselves with the defence of Koweit district.' The Secretary of State after consultation with the Foreign Office (F*0. letter of 13th October 1902) replied (telegram No.133 of 14th October 1902) 'I approve your proposed reply about the guns, provided Koweit district is clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the bay of that name.' This assurance similarly admits of being read as an assurance off.hoc , and it is relevant that when, in April 1911, enquiry was made by the Secretary of State for India of the Government of/of India whether the definition in question of Koweit territory had been communicated to the sheikh they replied that it might he assumed that it had, hut that it 'only referred to our pledge to defend him against Ihn hashid who was threatening the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit. (telegram of 6th April 1911, P.594/11). 8. The more specific undertakings embodied in the Bunder Shweikh lease of 1907 and quoted in paragraph 2 above may be regarded as to some extent conxnitting us in respect of 'the town of Koweit ana its boundaries'. The phrase 'its boundaries' is, however, very vague, and could perhaps most reasonably be construed as applying to the iumediate district around Koweit town. The discussions as to our obligations to the Sheikh which took place in 1911 and which are summarised in paragraphs 9 to 12 below, appear to have turned essentially on the undertakings oh 1899. 9* In 1911, in connection with the Anglo-Turkish negotiations, the question of our obligations was examined in some detail. The Government of India, on being asked, with reference to Lord Lanshowne's Memorandum of 1902 to which reference is made In paragraph 6 above, to 'define the region to which-our obligation extends, and 'whether they accepted' general description of boundaries in Persian Gulf Gazetteer, page 1059 etc;' replied 'We are of opinion that (1) our obligations extend to the limits of the .Sheikh's territory, (2) these limits, to the best of our knowledge, are defined with fair accuracy by Lorimer, especially as regards northern portion...' 10. The Secretary of State for India in the light of the Government of India’s views, wrote as follows to the Foreign Office (p.594/11, 8th April 1911); 'Viscount/”¥ is count Mor ley is not aware on what grounds the opinion expressed by the Marquess of Lansdowne in his memorandum of 21st March 1902 is based, but he observes that the language used is very tentative, and, so far as he knows, the subject was never pursued along the lines suggested by His Lordship, except in the case of the attack on the immediate neighbourhood of Koweit threatened by Ibn Rashid in the autumn of 1902. It will be seen from the Oxovernment of India’s telegram of 6 April that this incident does not affect their opinion that our general obligations extend, to the limits of Koweit territory as described in Vol.II pp.1059-1051 of Lorinerts (Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, copy of which is in your possession. In this Lord Mor ley concurs: that is to say he thinks that in the event of unprovoked aggression by the Turks or by Arab tribes under Turkish control, upon those limits, H.M.G. could not abstain from using their 'good offices 5 ’ in the Sheikh’s favour. But the term ’’good offices” is a very vague one, which H.M.G. are at liberty to interpret at their discretion, and which they would doubtless interpret with more or less strictness according to the nature and locality of the aggression, and all the circumstances of the case. It would, however, in His Lordship’s opinion, be very impolitic to attempt, in dealing with the Sheikh, to writtie down the extent of our obligations, since such a course would fill his mind with suspicions and could not fail to affect *' o ur unfavourably/prestige in the Persian Gulf....' 11. The P.O.replied on 9 May 1911 that Sir n.Grey concurred ”in the view of the Government of India, snared by Viscount Morlev, that these obligations extend to tne whole territory of the Sheikh as described in the passage of Lorimer’s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf to which your letter6 x rov /s v I. ag 12. In Aug: 1911 tbs Government of India, after consultation with the Political Resident (Sir P,Cox) recommended that H.M.G. should communicate to the Turks a copy of the Agreement of 1699 with a note that H.M.il.had subsequently informed the Sheikh that so long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the 11 Agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Koweit against attack by land or sea.' The Secretary of State for -India, on closer consideration, found himself unable to accept this proposal. India Office letter to the Foreign Office of 30th October,1911, P.1446/11, remarked: 'The telegrams of 4th December 1901 and 14th October 1902, on which the Government of India appear to base the obligation to protect Koweit by land ana sea,, in the Marquis of Crewe's opinion clearly refer only to the incidents that occasioned tnem and cannot oe undersoooa have given any general undertaking, dor, in view of the iact that it has since been decided that our obligations extern to the whole of the Sheikh’s territory as described in Lorimer’s Gazetteer, would it be sate to pledge ourselves to any specific method of defending them. As was pointed out by Lord Morley in this Office letter of 6th April last, the term 'good offices' (which by Colonel Meade’s letter of 23rd January 1999 we undertook to accord to the bneikn)is &amp; conveniently vague one and Lord Crewe is oi opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by H.M.G. in 1901/02, when men and gins were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to tne Poroe in w,nt .^ay we are prepared to interpret the term ix necessity ariseo. 'His Lordship would therefore suggest that the formula should run: 'As regards No.l, H.M.G. have informed the Sheikh of Koweit .that so long as he and his s ^^g g ^/ H- 7 - 7 (S)r successors act up to their obligations under the Agreement, undertake to support them and accord them their good offices,' with perhaps the addition that H.M.G. reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.' The Foreign Office (F.O.letter dated 1st November 1911) accepted the proposed redraft and addition and a communication in this sense was made to Tewfik Pasha in Sir Edward Gray’s letter of 24th October 1911(42135). 13. The undertaking given in 1914 that Koweit 'shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection' may be regarded as importing a degree of responsibility for the protection of the principality as a whole. 14. On the death of Sheikh Mobarak his eldest son was informed in March 1916 on his accession by the Viceroy that 'so long as you act up to the existing arrangements with the British Government you may expect the same support as was enjoyed by your father.' A similar assurance was given on Sheikh Jabir’s death in 1917 to his brother and successor, Sheikh Salim, in March 1917. Sheikh Salim’s conduct was unsatisfactory and it ?/as found necessary to warn him,through the Political Resident, on 5th July 1918, that the assurances (which presumably covered the assurauce of 3 Nov. 1914) conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour and that should acts 'contrary to the interests of (His Majesty’s Government' 'unfortunately be committed in future' he would be held personally responsible. 15 In connection with the operations against the • G • Ikhwan in 1928 the question of the precise extent of the obligations of H.M.G.for the defence of Koweit was considered innthe India Office, when the view was put forward that '&gt;• /consideration of our engagements suggested that on a strict )ara/ reading our liability could be confined to the protection I, 1 of/7 / - 8 - .? 4 - V- ^ J ~ oi Lne town of Koweit and that ws ars not called upon to protect Koweit territory as a whole. Con clusion. .. 15. As will be seen from the correspondence summarised above (a) we appear consistently to have taken the view that our obligations are conditional on the good behaviour of the Sheikh; (b) secondly, subject to this reservation, we are committed to 'good offices' 5 in respect of 'Koweit H , an assurance which has since 1911 been accepted as extending to the whole territory of the Sheikhdom, but which would not commit us to anything further than dijjlomatic support; (c) thirdly, we have pro mi sed 'that the town of Koweit and its boundaries' 'belong to ' the heirs of Sheikh liobarak; (while the payment of rent for the Bunder Snweikh■ site was terminated in 1907, the Agreement of 1907 was not abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges embodied in that Agreement should apparently still be regarded as binding in so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments, he communicated Article IX of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement to Ibn Baud in 1928: and in 1933 the P.A.Koweit and tne Political Resident brought to notice the continued e: istence of ohe yf / obligations of the Sheikh in regard uo Customs duuies(para.^ above) under Article X of the Agreement) (b) fourthly,that we have undertaken to recognise, and have in iacu re cognised, Koweit as an independent principality under British protection. No definition has been given or attempted of ^ne meaning of 'British protection' in this connection, ana anile priim facie the Sheikh might apparently be justified in claiming that it represented an assurance of effective protection in respect of the Vnole of nis principality, there is some room for discussion as to its precise implicationo, and it is noteworthy that no appeal rppears uo have been mc^ae . under it either by the present Sheikh or by his predecesbors. -NDIa OFFICE, 11 Oct. 1933, J.G.

Usual Ending.( Received under Bushire Printed letter 1366 -S, the 25th October, 1933). t/v C-9J \\Jj Cj ' r /Jvu^do- 6-3, dated f- British Residency &amp; Consulate-General No. 1365-3 of 1933 Bushire, the 25th Oct.1933 Sir, / I have the honour to refer to your letter No.P.Z 6555/33, dated the 13th October 1933, enclosinp; a copy of the record of an Interdepartmental meeting held at the Foreign Office on 5th instant, Note by Sir Andrew Ryan on Ibn Saud f s attitude towards Kuwait, and India Office Provi sional Note, dated the 11th October 1933, on the obligations of 11.11* s Government towards the Shaikh of Kuwait I discussed the matter with the Political Agent, Kuwait, when I passed through there recently on my way to Bushire. 2. One of the two questions (the other is dealt with below in paragraphs 7 and 8)discussed at the meeting was brief ly whether, with a view to maintaining our cohtrol over Kuwait which was undoubtedly fast increasing in importance as a Political and strategical centre in tie Middle Bast, (a) it was advisable to declare a British protectorate over that Sheikhdom, or (b) whether sufficient control could not be obtained over the Shaikh as opportunity offered by filling in the gaps which at present existed in our agreements with him. 3. As will be seen from the record, prime facie I favoured (b) rather than (a), and further reflection and my discussion with Colonel Dickson, who agrees with me, has con firmed me in that opinion. The objections to (a) are that, in our - (i.e. Colonel Dickson s and my), opinion a protectorate would most probably meet with considerable opposition from the Shaikh, who while valuing his British connection values equally highly his independence in the eyes of his fellow Secretary of State for India, The India Office, LCKDCN s Ma j e s ty T s2 fellow iirab rulers, and the outside world in general. The de claration of such a protectorate would likewise alarm the other Shaikhs on the xirab Coast of the Gulf. It might also in volve His Majesty’s Government in a measure of interference in the internal affairs of Kuwait which can at present be avoided. The question of slavery in Kuwait, for example, as part of the Slavery question in the Gulf generally, will doubtless be raised in the future by the recently established Permanent Slavery Committee of the League of Nations, and as we have no Slave Agreement with the Huler, such as exists with the other Arab rulers by which the local Political Agent can manumit slaves, the Kuwait aspect of this problem offers special difficulties. So long as Kuwait remains independent His Majesty’s Government’s respondibility in the matter is presumably limited to representation and persuasions to •the Shaikh. In the event, however, of a British protectorate being declared over the Shaikhdom, His Majesty’s Government might possibly be committed to more drastic action. Finally it is not a, improbably, though this is a matter outside my sphere, that the declaration of a Kuwait protectorate might lead to somewhat awk ward accusations from other governments of ’land grabbing’ and the like, with which we have been familiar enough in the past with regard to other areas. 4. An examination of the alternative policy (b) shows that, unsatisfactory as our present/treaty relationship with the Shaikh may be, (as was pointed out at the meeting), we have a certain control over the Ruler,( see India Office Lote r Obligations of His Majesty’s Government toward-s the Shaikh of Kuwait), and where our Agreements show gaps, these can to a large extent be filled up. Thus control of awSl/tion through Kuwait, whether military or civil, would be in the hands of His Majesty’s govern ment under the proposed Air xigreement (vide correspondence ending ■fljrj_th Government of India, foreign and Political uepa.i tment _jX .ress letter No. ? . 364-11/33, dated the 21st August 1933, to TT is Majesty’s Secretary of State for India) would place jurisdiction over non- Moslem foreigners in Kuwait in the hands of the lolitical Ageni* 5. A third -gap’ is the habit of direct correspondencecorrespondence which has grown up between the Shaikh and Ibn Saud, and which was dealt with at some length at the meeting. The outcome of my discussion with Colonel Dickson on this point is as follows. There would appear to be two ways in which we can ensure control over this correspondence. (1) By informing the Shaikh that before despatching any official communication to Ibn Saud he should show it to w i ' tttwmI the Political Agent, and should take similar action with com munications received from Ibn Saud. This has been the Shaikh’s Qustom in the past, at any rate in regard to his outward cor respondence, whether he has shown all Ibn Baud’s official letters to Colonel Dickson we do not, of course, know. After the Shaikh had received our communication, which would, of course, be tactfully worded and would merely ask him to con tinue the practice which he already observed, he would not be able to quote officially any letters which he had not shown to the Political Agent. If for instance, in order to present His Majesty’s Government with a fait accompli 4 on some point agreed upon between Ibn Saud and himself, he should produce a communication which, had not been seen by the Political A^ent, we could ignore it. Both Colonel/and I think that perhaps it would be better in our communication not to refer to any carticiilar correspondence but to treat the matter on general grounds. The above refers, of course, to ° ^ correspon dence: nothing we can do will prevent ’private and personal’ letters passing between the two potentates. (2) The second alternative is to insist that of ficial correspondence between the Shaikh and Ibn Sauo. should pass through His Majesty’s Government’s local representatives: the Minister at Jedda, and the Political Agent, Muwait ( or perhaps the Resident, Persian Gulf). This is already the nrocedure in forde (at the Shaikh’s own request; in regard to the Shaikh’s correspondence with the ’Iraq Government, and so no new departure in principle would be involved. The advantage of this alternative would be its emphasis to Ibn Saud of theof the special relations that Kuwait has with His llajesty’ s Government, which emphasis is apparently particularly needed at the present juncture. (Vide Conclusion of the Meeting). As against this advantage Colonel Dickson is of the opinion that the Shaikh, who regards Ibn Saud, in spite of the latter’s treatment of Kuwait, in a somewhat different light to ’Iraq, might object more or less strongly to the proposal. 6. Considering all the circumstances I would suggest that I be authorised to instruct Colonel Dickson to approach the Shaikh verbally on the following lines. That His Majesty’s Government have had it recently brought to their notice that Ibn Saud apparently harbours designs of trying to reduce Kuwait to a position of dependence on him, similar - for instance - to that of Asir; that it is possible that the practice of direct correspondence between him - the Shaikh - and Ibn Saud which has grown up of late, even though he - the Shaikh - shows the correspondence to the Political ^gent, has somewhat obscured in the eyes of Ibn Saud the fact of Kuwait’s special relations of protection, etc. with Mis Majesty’s Government; that it would put this correspondence on a safer and more regular footing, if it was conducted as was the correspondence with the ’Iraq Government, i.e. through His Majesty’s Government’s local re presentatives; that in addition an intimation to tTis e^'ect to Ibn Saud would bring sharply to his notice Kuwait s re lations with His Majesty’s Government; and ’that finally Pis Majesty’s Government would be glad to learn confidentially and informally what were his — the Shaikh’s — reactions to the proposal. I trust I may be authorised to take this step as soon as possible and when the Shaikh’s attitude has become known I will make recommendations as to which alternative should be adopted. 7. The other question discussed at the meeting, (referred to at the beginning of paragraph 2 above), was the exact extent of His Majesty’s Government’s obligations to protect the in- terests of Kuwait. The moat important of these obligations5 ( 5 &gt; 1 obligations, which are dealt with in the India Office Note on the subject, and the one which in a sense determines any others there may be, is that of protection against hostile incursions or invasions. His Lajesty's Government *s Agree ments with the Shaikh are three in number: That of January 1899 that of October 1907 that of November 1914. 8. The Agreement of 1899, as far as ’protection’ is concerned, in return for the good behaviour of the Shaikh and his successors, merely promised the ’’good offices” of T 'is Majesty’s Government, ’’whatever that may mean” as Lord Lands- downe later remarked. Our construction of this Agreement appears to have been the convenient one that we could choose the circumstances in which we need, or need not, protect Kuwait in any particular crisis that arose, the exact area which we were responsible for defending being left more or less vague. 9. The Agreement of 1907 merely confirmed from His Majesty’s Government thaf’the town of Kuwait and its boundaries?’ belonged to the Shaikh of that day and his successors. This Agreement in no way added, in principle, to our nebulous res ponsibilities for the defence of Kuwait, though possibly read with that of 1899 it might increase these responsibilities up to the*boundaries’ 10. The 1914 Agreement states that in return ^or the Shaikh’s co-operation against the Turks ’’Kuwait shall be re cognized as an independent principality under British pro tection”. This, unlike the phraseology of the previous Agreement, is a most categorical assurance, and the word ’principality’ and not ’town’ being used, would seem definitely to place the responsibility o^ protecting the whole of the Kuwait Sheikhdom on ^is Majesty’s Government. Personally I cannot agree with the view quoted in paragraph 15 of the India Office Note that ”ona strict reading our liability could be confined to the protection of the town of Kuwait and that wewe are not called upon to protect Kuwait as a whole'. It is true, as pointed out in the Note (paragraph 17(d), tftat neither the present Shaikh, nor his predecessors, appear to have ap pealed under this Agreement to His Lajesty’s Government, but that hardly relieves us from our obligations. This does not imply, of course, that His Majesty’s Government’s obligations relieve the Shaikh completely of the responsibility of his own defence. The Shaikh should certainly be able to deal with any small raids across his frontiers, and should only look for assistance from His Majesty’s Government in the case of more serious incursions. This in fact was presumably the at titude taken up after the Akhwan operations of 1928 when the Shaikh was encouraged to purchase half a dozen 'ord vanettes, Lewis guns which were mounted in the vanettes, and ammunition, and when some of his men received training from the Royal Air force as machine gunners. 11. In conclusion I venture to suggest that this question, the exact extent of the obligations of His Majesty’s Government for the protection of Kuwait, be investigated with a view to a definite decision on the subject. Tie question is an im portant one, and the advantages of having a clear conception of what our responsibilities may be in time of crisis, be ore such a crisis arises, are obvious.

It was the same messenger who brought back the serious news which I telegraphed to you under my No.25, dated the 26th January 1934, although you will notice that the King makes no mention of a crisis at all, (according to the Shaikh he naturally would not do this.) 5, For your information the full story as brcaight by the messenger is as follows: y The Emir Saaiyed al Faisal, Commander of the ad&amp;nee troops on the left flank of Bin Baud’s forces, had (early in January) made a sudden and treacherous attack on a fe*c force of about 1,000 of the Imam Yahya’s army in the vicinity of Badr (Nejran). The latter had been complete ly surprised and had lost 700 men killed. The occurrence/The occurrence took place during a truce when full peace negotiations were proceeding and after Bin Baud had issued most stringent orders to all his generals that no aggressive move whatever was to be undertaken* As a result of the incident the Imam Yahya at once broke off all peace conversations, and ordered his armies to hold themselves in readiness for an immediate offensive. Bin Sand had at once dismissed Saayid bin Faisal And had telegraphically disowned the attack and expressed regrets, but the Imam Yahya had refused to accept his explanation s* A couple of days before the messenger left Riath, Bin Baud believing war to be eminent, had sent his son the Smir Baud post haste to Ebha to take supreme com mand of the Sa 1 udi armies in Asir. With him had gone all available troops in Riath (800 men) in 80 li^it lorries under the following members of the Royal Family: Khalid bin Mohamed as Baud Fahad bin Sa^d al Baud. 6* His Excellency the Shaikh when telling me the above story stated that hitherto he bad not believed there vould be any war, but in view of his man’s story he feared only a miracle could avert hostilities now. What made him more pessimistic was the fact that he had received by the Air Mail of 19th January, a letter dated the 10th fran a Kuwait subject in Aden to the effect that Yahya appeared entirely bent on war and had concentrated all available troops on the Asir front and was sending large quantities of arms and ammunition to the tribes of Asir. 7. While I think it somewhat early to accept the story of the Shaikh’s messenger, I nevertheless fear there may be considerable truth in his report. The change in the attitude of the Shaikh is in itself disturbing. In the past he/he ^ has always been veiy confident that no breach would take place* 8* I note that news from Bahrain (23.1.34)has it that the Amir Saud only went to Asir to meet the Imam Yahya f s son preparatory to fixing boundaries between the two States, as a result of peace having been declared. This entirely contradicts the news given me by the Shaikh of Kuwait, as you will see.

With reference to my telegram No.Q2, dated the 1st March 1954, I have the honour to enclose translations of the following letters which were brought by K.B.Abdul Latif bin Abdul Jalil by car from Riath on Tuesday evening.

King Abdul Aziz to H.E. the Shaikh, together with a very confidential 'Mulhaq' or enclosure. 2. As regards the King’s letter to me, I propose replying as I do on such occasions giving news of my health etc. and local matters of interest etc. 5* As regards the King’s 'Mulhaq” to the Shaikh giving latest Yemen news: This was of sufficient interest to cause His Excellency the Shaikh to pay me a special visit. 4. The latter said that, reading between the lines, as he could do being an Arab, better than I could, he saw that matters in Asir were clearly fast approaching a crisis for the following reasons: (a) The Imam Yahya was clearly out to waste time and give Bin Saud 'snooth' words outwardly, but all the time he was continuing his under ground hostile activities (such as encouraging the Asir tribes to rise and cut communications etc.etc.) (b) Yahyas obvious intention was to pin the Saudi forces to the Asir country until the hot weathei came on, when the King would be forced to give way to all his demands or fight at a serioustom v — 2 — serious disadvantage, (o) Yahya knew that Bin Saud was only keeping his Asir anay supplied with food by superhuman efforts and that money and supplies must fail, if he procrastinated long enough, (d) Bin Baud’s army was pressing the King 1 ^ daily either to attack or abandon Asir for the leaders recognized that inaction was weakening them, and playing into the hands of Yahya, (e) Bin Saud saw all this clearly too, but dare not risk a pitched battle. 5. Taking all the above into consideration, His Excellency was of opinion that the crisis was near now, but was still of opinion (expressed at the commencement of the Yemen trouble), that there would no war, and that a settlement would be arrived at, 6* The crux of the situation now lay, said the bhaikh, in the IDRISI* Yahya wanted Bin Saud to give the Idrisi a small slice of Asir to reside in under his (Yahya's) guarantee of good behaviour while Bin Saud wanted (a) either the surrender unconditionally of the ^ Idrisi or that Yahya should keep him (Idrisi) under surveillance In some toim in the interior of Yemen, he (Bin Saud) paying him a salary; (b) that Yahya should pay Bin Saud the totol cost of maintaining his army in the field, calculated at approximately W-S. a d ay per man from the day the trouble began. 7. The above conditions were brought to His Excellencj by K.B.Abdul Latif bin Abdul Jalil, who got them from the King at Riath.Translation of a letter No.50/1/9, dated the 6 th Dhil qa’dah 1352 (20.2.34), from His Majesty King Abdul Aziz bin Sa’ud, to Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.S., Political Agent, Kuwait.

Dear Brother! I have been informed by our mutual friend, Abdul Latif bin Abdul Jalil, that you are very anxious to know the news of Yemen. We would have told you everything before regarding the Ruler and Master of Yemen, but his is a difficult and wonderful case. One cannot express all one would like to say about^copious 'talkings', everything he says is clever indeed, also his promises are many. But his underground activities and heart generally are utterly treacherous. We, on the other hand, are doing our best to smooth things over and trust God may make conditions better, because we do not wish for War at all, but much prefer peace and tranquility. It has now been ordained that the Imam Yahya has been constrained to send a mission to our side under one, Ibn al Wazir by name. From the mission’s preliminary talk we would appear to be very far indeed from peace, and only God knows how the matter will end. W©, for our pert, will strain every nerve to arrange what is good ior the Muslims. We know however that you fully know the methods and cunning ways of the ’’Gentleman 1 ’ we are dealing with, nor is it obscure to others.

From Lieutenant-Colonel H.R.P. Dickson, C.I.S., Political .agent, Kuwait. To His Majesty *ibdul ^ziz bin ^.bdur Rahman al~ Faisal as-Sa’ud etc., ] Your Majesty, I have the honour to acknowledge Your Majesty’s very gracious and kind letter dated the 6th Dhil ^a’dah 1352, which duly reached me by the hand of Khan Bahadur Abdul Latif bin Abdul Jalil on 1st March 1934 (15th Dhil ^a’dah 1352}. Your Majesty’s very gracious enquiries after my a health and other matters of/personal nature, touched me more than I can say and once again proves to me, as you have shown on many occasions before, that Your Majesty does not forget an old friend; and that Your Majesty is the personification of ”al wafah”. sxS regards my health, thanks be to God it contin ues to be of the best, as also does that of my wife and children. This I know will give Your Majesty satisfaction to hear. My family returned from England last month, that is to say the iZhatoon whom the ^rabs call Um Sa’ud together v/ith my daughter Zahra. My son remained behind at School in England; this will be for his good, and will help to make a man of him please God. He will be eleven years old this summer. The return of my family naturally gave me much satisfaction, as it is difficult for a man to live without a woman to look after his house.2 i. iiope myself to go to Sngland about the middle of June next (early in the Rabi* Auv/al 1353) on 3i months leave: botn in order to take a short rest from my work and to see my son, I shall not fail to call on Your Majesty’s trusty Minister His Excellency Shaikh Hafidh V.ahba, with whom Doth 1 and my family are on the friendliest of terms. Major Jatts from Bushire will probably act for me during my absence. It is a matter of very great regret to me that I shall be retiring in two years from now, that is in February 1936 - as I shall then reach the age of 55 fixed by G-overn- ment. The prospect of having to give up work among the .urabs for whom I bear such a deep affection, naturally causes me concern already. I shall probably buy a house in Kuwait before I finally retire, so as to be able to come back again from England, and settle down here, after arranging for my child ren’s future. Mrs. Dickson like myself would prefer to live among the Arabs than settle down in England among people we do not know, and have no sympathies for. As regards your brother Shaikh Ahmad, my relations with him continue to be of the best, indeed he and I are more like elder and younger brothers, than Political xigent and Ruler. I think he realizes now that he has no better adviser and friend than myself. After all though I am the Govern ment’s representative in Kuwait, that does not prevent me from having a personal affection for its ruler. It continues to be a matter of the greatest regret been here to me that I have/4i years and have not yet succeeded in bring ing about a satisfactory settlement of the Customs and Block ade difficulties which exist between Your Majesty and Kuwait. 3 This3 &amp; Tills causes me the greatest regret as my personal regard for Your Majesty remains exactly the same as it ever was, and I know that between You and -*ihmad there has always been and con tinues to be a deep affection. In very truth as Your Majesty has often said, there is no difference between the people of Kuwait and the people of Nejd and the interests of the ^-1 Sa’ud and the Ai 3ubah are so bound up with each other that should one state ever see the other in difficulty, I know that the other would come to its assistance at once. After all blood is thicker than water. The news that matters in Nejd are progressing favour ably gives me great satisfactiono I pray that God will shortly bring about a peaceful solution of all Your Majesty’s difficult ies in Yemen also, for it is unthinkable that war should break out between Arabs and brother Muslims. Both I and my family send Your Majesty our deep respects and affectionate salutations. Usual endingX * * fa** ' i ■ 4 '-■■■ / ) Telegram I.If v .O. Ex. 1950. Erom Retaxandum, London.

Have had several long discussions with Shaikh with following result: (a) Shaikh perfectly willing to abandon all claims other than personal loan, if only he can be given some sort of general assurance ^ai-elng by His Iiajesty T s Government that negotiations with Bin Saud regarding raising of Blockade will be pressed to successful conclusion, and that Bin Sauo. will be compelled uO adhere to terms of any agreement arrived at. (b) Shaikh utterly distrusts Bin Saud and believes him capable of making any promises to His Majesty's Government (even to agreeing to Kuwait's conditions of customs posts on frontier) with no intention of carrying them out. For instance he may declare blockade raised but if there is no good will and he secretly prevents his subjects from coming up to Kuwait to buy goods, the position is the same as before. Kuwait being sellers not carriers. (c) In short Bhaikh while most anxious not to appear unreasonable fears that he may find himself in position of having signed away his just claims and in end have nothing to show for it owing to His Majesty's Government's reluctance to press Bin Gaud too hard. -Political-\db r~ /0S&gt; l^rom Political ^esiderit at Bahrain H.Me’s Secretary of State for India London,, Cp-py by air mail to Govcrnnent of India, Ncy; B e ihie Political Afrent, Ku-wait^ Mo.1*/I03.

I am increasingly disturbed at possiblity of two separate conflicts with Ibn Saud over Kuwait and area east of Blue Line. See paragraph 4 of my telegram No.40. Atmosphere may now be clouded by latest row induced by incident and no question can be considered without taking account of Saudi-Yemen situation which may be developing more rapidly than seemed likely three weeks ago. If Ibn Saud wins th in conflict with Imam in which His Majesty* s Government has done nothing material to help him he will be encouraged to resist our claims in eastern Arabia. He may be all the readier to do s o though this is conjecture as a result of establishment of direct contact with Arab leaders taking part in mission of mediation now here. If he is worsted by Imam he will think His Majesty*s Govern ment are taking advantage of his difficulties to embark on forward policy on eastern side of his dominions. mentioned in first sentence cannot be altered. It occurred to me however that appearance of double attack on Ibn Laud might be mitigated by a preliminary communication on the I realise that policy in regard to question following lines if Shaikh of Kuwait abandons his pecuniary claims : Shaikh2 ( o Shaikh of Kuwait has waived claim and His Majesty’s Government intend to pursue actively question of Kuwait blockade settlement of which is imperative. Course of correspondence regarding claims has revealed dangerous misunderstandings as a result of direct correspondence between Shaikh and Ibn aud. In view of their special relations with Kuwait nature of which was explained to Saudi Government in 19 27, His Majesty’s Government consider matter affecting official relations between Ibn Saud and Shaikh should be conducted through their intermediary. This applies also to neutral zone regarding which Sadui Government have recently consulted His Majesty’s Government but only after intimating ? theme very considerably to certain parties on a matter (Oil) which equally concerns Shaikh and therefore His Majesty’s Government. Latter have also had reasons for perturbation as regards relations between Ibn Saud and one of the rulers of (Qatar) ed in same articles of Treaty of Jedda. They wish to remind Saudi Government that their interests in these matters depends on specific treaties with than and on fact that their territories within British sphere of influence as defined by Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 and 1914 which determined eastern boundaries of ^ejd as His Majesty’s Government have recently had oc caaion to to united States Government in reply to an enquiry. I submit this suggest! on wi th diffidence. If it were possible to adopt it I suggest conmunication in form of memorandum from His Majesty’s Government. As such it would pave the way for action Kuwait blockade quest! on on whatever line you cont an plate. As regards neutral zone it would be established position that Ibn Saud cannot expect His Majesty’s Government merely to bring Shaikh into line with his own premature arrangements with prospective concessionaries. As regards Qatar it would produce3 would produce effect intermediate between that of alternative (b) and (c). It would indicate views of His Majesty’s Government clearly without making Blue Line separate immediate issue and would therefore be no more likely than (b) to be regarded as a challenge. -Ryan-II!

On the other hand question of his Hastern boundary will have to be broached as soon as instructions reach you more especially since information regarding attitude of His Majesty’s Government may at any time reach him through American channels.

It means, I think, that Haflth Sahba will be in Kuwait somewhere about 15th December. 3. Clearly his visit has been timed to coincide with Bin Baud's so called hunting expedition round 'D^hal al Faraih' {See my telegram of today's date). 4. The Shaikh, ?/ho I saw this morning thinks that Bin Saud may possibly move up into the Gara’a region North of Safa where there are many gazelle and lots of Hubara, that is to say some 100 miles from Kuwait. He may even camp at our old friend 'Khabari Vadtha' where water pools are reported to be plentiful. 5. a Kuwaiti notable, one Karzuk al Fadr of Anaze stock who visited Bin Baud at Riath on 17th and returned to Kuwait on Monday night (26.11.54) told the Bhaikh (this I had from the Shaikh also today) that Bin laud talked long and late with him, about his ancient love and friendship for the Al Subah and especially for his dear Shaikh Ahmad, who from boyhood he had treated like a younger brother etc. etc. That he had been forced to blockade Kuwait against his will etc. etc., but by God if only Ahmad would pay him even a a i! v ' u p X small/amount as a sort of annual 'Xmas Box' he would certainly renounce the Blockade. ,. 6.

The Shaikh says he is quite certain that the whole thing denotes e typical Bin Saud attempt to lead His Majesty’s Government, neighbouring Arab States, and especially his own very dissatisfied tribes, away fron realities, and make them think that he has come out of the Yemen War with great strength than ever, when In truth his position was most 'Shaky', and his prestige internally badly impaired. The Shaikh Insists that this loss of prestige is behind every thing and that Bin Baud’s one aim just now is to rehabilitate himself with his own people, by leading their thoughts else where. I agree with thfes view. It will be interesting to see - I?**' 1 what the next few weeks bring us.

Sir, With referehee to correspondence ending with ray telegram No.2-C^ dated the 19th January 1935, copy of which was sent by me to H.M’s Secretary of State for India and to the Government of India; I have the honour — '7 r V o i forward, for your information, the marginally noted • — -) .Confidential Letter No.C-18, dated 18.1.35. from the ) correspon- Political Agent, Kuwait to H.E.the Shaikh. ) } dence, which Confidential Letter No.1-4/1900, dated 20.1.35 from ) H.E.the Shaikh to the Political Agent, | has recently passed between myself and His Excellency the Shaikh ol Kuwait. h 7^3 2. You will note from the Shaikh^ reply to my letter (which of necessity had to be somewhat on the long side in view of the length of time that has elapsed since the matter was previously raised with the King of ^audi Arabia) that he lays stress on the following points {he was able to emphasize these even more fully in xhe talk he had with me previous to the exchange of letters) (a) Out of consideration for His Majesty’s Government's expressed views and proposals, he (Shaikh) agrees to drop all his claims against Bin Saud in the coming negotiations to be initiated by His Majesty's Government, except for his ’'Personal Loan”. This, always provided, that Bin Saudthat Bin saud will receive His Majesty’s Government’s advances in a friendly and accommodating spirit, means business, and will agree to raise the Blockade, and in place of same establish one or more customs posts on his side of the frontier. (b) Should however Bin Saud 'harden his heart', and in spite of all efforts of His Majesty’s Government, should he refuse to agree to a settlement on the above lines, then he (the Shaikh) feels bound to say now, that the situation must be considered as remaining unchanged and Kuwait 'Claims' against Bin Saud (which are not his own^ but those of his people) shall be exactly in the same position as they were before the negotiations started; He puts it this way as he does not wish to start a fresh dispute with the King over 'Claims' and so spoil the good relations that exist. (o) He (the Shaikh) never had, and still has no faith whatsoever in the Blockade impasse being settled by means of selected iirsb 'Commissioners ,? , but if His Majesty’s Government desire to give the idea a preliminary trial, he will raise no objection, though he reiterates his previous warning that such Commissioners’ efforts must from the nature of things prove abortive. (d) He (Shaikh) reiterates his conviction that if His Majesty’s Government will seriously deal with the matter themselves, the blockade problem will be easily and satisfactorily solved. (The implication here is, that no amount of persuasive elo ,uence will be of any use with the King, but that/- 3 - ,-| that only a 'firm front” will bring about the favourable reaction necessary for a settlement}• 3. My own views are that the Shaikh knows fully well that he has not a ghost of a chance of ever getting money compensation for his 'Claims*, but that he wants to be able to justify all he does in this matter to his people. He wants to tell them in open Mejliss if necessary, something of the following nature (We must not forget that we are dealing with an almost Bedouin Democracy where relations between Ruler and ruled are personal). 'The protecting power have generously offered to 'reopen negotiations with Bin Saud for the removal of 'the Blockade. I have welcomed the idea - I have 'gone further and have offered to abandon all your 'and my just 'claims' against the King,for damage 'and destruction caused by his Akhwan forces in the 'past, to prove that for our part, we are imbued 'with the fullest good will and are prepared to bury 'the past for ever. T have made the condition, however, 'that Bin Saud shows equal good will and genuinely 'attempts to meet our advance by an equal act of 'generosity. Should he agree to replace his Blockade 'by one or more customs posts on the frontier as the 'protecting power is going to ask him to do, then 'all is well - If he is not willing to meet the 'protecting power’s proposals and rejects our advances, 'then all that is left for us to do is to withdraw our 'offer in the matter of 'claims** and put our reliance 'in God and ask Him to recover them for us in his 'good time'. 4. in my opinion. His Majesty's Government need not worry much at this stage about the Shaikh's 'claims' proviso and attempt to safeguard himself with his people. They should go ahead, I think, and tell Bin Saud that the Shaikh is ready to show his good will by dropping the 'claims'.4 which he has hitherto inede as a preliminary to negotiations being opened, 5, But if negotiations showed definite signs of going wrong or of failing altogether, His Majesty's G-ovemmen t should then, but only the, say to the King, that they felt it would only be fair to advise the Shaikh to with* draw his offer to drop his claims on the grounds that he would find it most difficult to deal with his subjects, and explain away how it was that he had given away their chance of getting baek 'blood money' for relatives killed,and money compensation for looted camels, sheep, horses^and had got nothing for them in return, I have the honour to be, Sir Your most obedient servant Lt, -Colonel 1 Political Agent, Kuwait vssCopy of a confidential letter No.C-18, dated the 18th January 1935, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait., jitter Compliments, I have the honour to inform Tour Excellency that His Majesty’s Government have informed me through the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that they have decided to reopen negotiations with His Majesty King Bin Baud, on the subject of the Kuwait Blockade. 2. Your Excellency will recollect that at the end of March 1934, and acting under instructions of His Majesty’s Government, I had several discussions with you over this selfsame blockade question, and I infoimed you then that His Majesty’s Government could not again start negotiations with Bin Saud, as they were ready and anxious to do, unless Your Excellency agreed to abandon the ’’Claims'' which you had made against the King in respect of damage inflicted by the Akhwan* This was because of Bin Baud’s difficult attitude in the matter, and because of his insistence that Your Excellency had agreed to bury all past claims as between Nejd and Kuwait in 1932. 3. As a result of our discussions Your Excellency on 3rd April 1934 intimated to me your entire willingness to abandon all your ’’claims”, with the exception of the Personal Loan m_ade to Bin Baud by you on the occasion of the Hail Expedition, provided that His Majesty’s Government would give you some sort of general assurance that the negotiations with Bin Saud would be pressed to a successful conclusion. I duly informed His Majesty’s Government of what four Excellency said. 4. His Majesty’s Government have now directed me to inform Your Excellency that, in the nature of the case, it is quite impossible for them to give you an assurance that their negotiations with Bin 3aud will be successful,v y , WV' 1 successful, but that they will use their best endeavours to secure a satisfactory settlement of this question for Your Excellency, on the basis of Your Excellency’s own proposals for the establishment of one or more Customs posts etc. (If preliminary negotiations between Commissioners appointed by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia - this * **. . a f r9 ? a ^ Your Excellency, vide your letter No.B-381, or prove unsuccessful). 5. Regarding Your Excellency’s 'claims w against Bm ^Qud: His Majesty’s Government propose to inform the latter that while Your Excellency does not agree to the interpretation of earlier correspondence (i,e. the words T&amp;labat and Da’awi), Your Excellency does not wish to contest the matter with him, and further, is prepared to drop all claims, with the exception of the personal loan referred to in paragraph (2) above. 6. Moreover, His Majesty’s Government feel it essentia in Your Excellency’s own interests, that you should abandon this question of claims altogether, which in the eyes of Bin Baud is a decisive obstacle to the disposal of the Blockade question: Indeed His Majesty’s Government regard Your Excellency’s private correspondence with Bin Baud on the subject of these ’’claims’’, as having made it quite hopeless for Your Excellency to raise this question, through them, with the exception of course of your 'Personal' claims. Accordingly His Majesty’s Government propose to deal with the matter on the lines mentioned above.

In any preliminary conversations with Ibn Saud you may not wish to proceed beyond this stage. But I fully realise difficulties with which you may be faced and I do not desire to tie your hands unduly. Matter is mainly one of tactics as to which you are necessarily the best judge and you are therefore authorised if you consider that no settle ment is likely to be attainable otherwise to proceed either with King at Hiyadh or subsequently with Fuad Hamza as and when you consider it necessary or desirable to ? enter further stages suggested in paragraphs 8 and 9 below. 8. Second stage. Offer Ibn Saud in full sovereignty a relatively small area or stip immediately Hast of Blue Line as far as a line running from head of DOHAT-SS-S^L&gt;i/A to a point slightly south east of SAKAK (but leaving that place to Saudi ^Arabia) thence (leaving to qatar and Abu Dhaoi a strip of territory extending inland for no less than 25 miles to West of head of KHOR-iSL-ODSID) to North Western extremity of A^AL thence due southwards via (but to west of) B.-.NIYAN to parallel 20 degrees North whence it would gradually rejoin Violet Line. 9. If this offer proves insufficient} His kajesty's Government would be prepared to consider &gt;adding— t-o it as a third stage a settlement on the lines suggested in nendel's letter of November 7th to Mr.baithwaite (copy in my despatch No.436) involving creation of Desert Zone under a special regime for a period of ten or twenty years subject to re consideration at the request of either party at the end oi that time. (See also Conclusion One of Kiddle nast uud- Committee meeting of November 8th). Ibn Saud would maintain in /in this Zone any personal rights which he at present effectively exercises over nomadic tribes there e.g. right to levy zakat but would not posescss Vterritorial sovereignty and would therefore not be able to grant a concession. separate agreement. Boundaries of Desert Zone would be approximately those suggested in Rendel’s letter but would exclude BANIYAN* factory general settlement can be reached on basis even of this concession, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared in the last resort and in order to secure their desiderata in other directions to offer Ibn Saud lastly iull sovereignty of a part at least of Desert nrea referred to in immediately preceding paragraph subject however to s’ undertaking that no concession would be granted therefor by Ibn Saud except ^ after consultation with His Majesty’s Government and to ^ concessionnaires approved both by His Majesty’s Government and by Sauai Government. Precise limits to be suggested for this additional area are still under consideration and further instructions on this point will reach you as soon as possible. Idea at present being explored is that partrights or claim to any kind of sovereignty outside frontier line suggested in paragraphs 8 or 10 or mut&gt; 'ring fence' of Desert Zone (see paragraph 5 of Rend el’s letter to Mr. Laithwaite; • It would also be desirable for Kis Majesty’s Government to retain flying rights not only ov^r Desert Zone but also over any area which might eventually be conceded to Ibn Saud under paragraph 10* 12. You will no aoubt in any negotiations make such use as you can of fact that any of tnese concessions would involve acquisition by Ibn Saud of rights over very large areas to which he has at present no legal claim and would release him from obligations oi existing 'Blue Line' frontier from which he could not otherwise escape without great difficulty. 13. If you see any objection to any part of above programme I shall be glad to consider any observations you wish to offer. I trust however that present telegram will at any rate give you suificient idea generally oi desiderata of Eis Majesty’s Government to enable you to conduct preliminary discussions with King Ibn Saud at Riyadh ii you proceed rthere or with Fuad Hamza. 14.

Many thanks xor those instructions which will certainly enable me to conduct the first round with Fuad although I must study paragraphs 8 to 11 more closely before I can submit any report by telegraph on them. Meanwhile I submit the following points in anticipation of first conver sations with Fuad, who reached Mecca only yesterday and has not yet proposed a meeting. a. I am now disclined to go to Riadh in the near future even if Fuad brings an invitation which latest indications make me think doubta-ul. apart irom reasons of practical inconvenience which have some weight but are not insurmountable, I see increasing political objections to an unofficial visit. I do not expect Fuad to Vrenew his impossible suggestion that ?all the negotiations should take place at Riadh but impression is widespread that such negotiations are impending especially in view of position as regards Treaty of Jedda. This being so, my return, without having come to any definite agreement, might be misinterpreted locally ?as ?failure and ?due_to pressure. Moreover King feels so nervous over the Blue Line question that it would be better to confine myself to conversations with Fuad as long as possible• ^ jI propose, therelore, unless you see strong objections, to side-track any invitation, if I can do so without risk of offence, but intimate that invitation next summer would be welcome. I shall, of course, see King here in the interval. b. *Vhat maps are you using and what mays should I use in discussion with Fuad ? Map Department of Foreign Ofiice has, 1 think, list of mays available here. Further supply by bag of those to be used would be useful. c. I appreciate the effect of distinction drawn between personal and territorial sovereignty but I am not clear as to how distinction should be defined juridically if necessity arises. May I have infoi'mation on this subject, not necessarily by telegraph, if explanation is lengthy. -RYAN- I I * 4 J I |Telegram xx From Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London. To Minister, Jeciua. Ho.9. Repeated Government of India, Hew Delhi. Political Resident, Bushire. No.5. Dated 21st received 22nd January 1935. Your telegram No.6. Sub-paragraph (a). I do not altogether understand force of your first argument ag inst visit to Riadh since presumably some means, e.g. suitably worded official communi que, could be found to indicate that visit was intended that we should begin and not end negotiations. On the other hand local considerations must clearly be decisive. If therefore you consider it more advantageous to bring Kiiig into negotia tions at the end rather than at the start and if you are satisfied that evasion or non-acceptance of his invitation will not give offence I do not wish to press you to go to Raidh now. 2. Sub-paragraph (b). Maps found most useful for reference here are (a) »*ar Office map of Asia, published in i to 4 million. (b) Hunter*s two maps of Arabia. (c) j-hilby’s map Rub-al-Khali• (d) Bertram Thomas’s map oi the same. (e) Iraq Petroleum Company's map of ^atar. Of these you already have (b) and (c).

Dated 9th (received 11th) February 1935. f '5 *■ ' My telegram No.?. In further conversation on February 7th Fuad conveyed in studiously disarming language King r s views that it woikld be preferable not to make outstanding questions subject of general negotiations but to deal with each on its merits as in the past. When conversations from which present proposal had emerged were begun last June King that he could not co-ordinate general policy* His Majesty*s Government had diverted course of discussion to settlement of outstanding questions. His Majesty feared that il such questions were dealt with by way of general negotiations and these failed their result would be dangerously misinterpreted . 2 # After some discussion of this communication in which I took no strong line but was mildly critical, Fuad turned to question of Eastern frontiers. He asked to what form settlement of it would take. Would local Arab Rulers be in any way parties to discussion of it ? He assured me that Ibn Saud had no desire to interfere between His Majesty's Government and those Rulers but said that King must consider Moslem and Arab opinion and must avoid any appearance of dis regarding their position as Arabs. 3 . I replied that His Majesty's Government had never approached matter otherwise than as a question of determining boundaries between Saudi Arabia and an area with which they latter /Xat^er had placed themselves in our hands as regards foreign relations. 4. Fuad said that opinion which King had in mind was very ill-informed. He suggested that settlement would be easier if Rulers could be represented in some way by experts or if they would affirm their desire to be represented by His Majesty’s Government. 5. In view of new turn given to whole matter by Fuad’s communication I refrained from pressing him for precise state ment regarding Ibn Saud’s desiderata for which I had asked on January 21st. 6. I promised Fuad a communication about Kuwait but deferred it until I could study your telegram No.23 with previous correspondence. X said that I was awaiting instruc tions about agent for proposed local conference at Baiutain. We visualised on other questions including tnat of rrans- Jordanian frontier but only incidentally. i I*,'/ 7. My own view is that proposal regarding negotiations cannot usefully be pursued any further. I do not consider now that any of the concessions contemplated in paragraphs 8 to 10 of your telegram No .8f would attract Ibn Saud sufficiently to induce him to give us satisfaction onour questions for the sake of such concessions. On the other hand Fuad was so profuse in assurances of King settling all questions as to suggest that His Majesty is nervous. 8 This may : independent settlement with tribes of Kuwait and possibly other matters. 8. cconcession contemplated in your telegram No.8 were intended to form comprehensive settlement of outstanding questions. If these are to be dealt with separate ly question arises whether His Majesty’s Government are still -repared to offer them. There can be no settlement if they simply /-3- simply fall back on Anglo-Turkish Conventions. Difficulty of settlement on any basis whatever is greatly increased by intro duction of Arab nation factor♦ I have explained importance of ihis in my despatches Nos*17 and No.28 which should reach you about 11th and 18th February• Its _ is enhanced by moderation of Fuad l s language under King f s instructions on February 7th as compared with his private expression of his own sentiments on January 20th. 9. You may prefer to shelve question. If so, I can play for stalemate but this presents disadvantage that Ibn Saud will be left with a sense of grievance and as to future attitude of His Majesty's Government. Alternative is, in my opinion* to follow out in your telegram No .8 and to work simultaneously but independently for termination of Kuwait blockade which is next most important outstanding question. 10. We must however be prepared for rejection tff all proposed concessions not merely because of greatest of Ibn Saud 9 s pretensions but because of his acceptance oi principle that he must base his a ction to some extent on Arab nationalist view. I have been speculating very tentatively as to possibility of a sfciieme based on that oi i.e. that His Majesty's Government is an agreement between Ibn Saud Sultan of Muscat and Oman and themselves representing all Rulers from Mo&amp;all&amp; Qst-sr with express consent of those Rulers on lines of general a. all parties to recognise each others independence. b. all parties to recognise for a period existence of a positive zone in which none would exer cise any rights of territorial sovereignty. 11. This solution may be completely impossible. I cannot say that it would be acceptable to Ibn Saud. In any case /V -4- case it would obviously require long preparation and possibly some sort of a conference to define the desert zone and to elaborate other details.

In that case however you will no doubt consider the possibility of following up suggestion you Jjourself made at the end of Middle East official Sub-Committee Meeting of November 8th, that discussion of Kuwait Blockade question should be taken ^ ^ first. 2. Paragraph 2 your telegram. It is, I suppose, to see how much he can extrqct from His Majesty’s Government but that if His Majesty's Government reacted violently Ibn Saud will tighten rein. In any case it must be made clear to Saudi Government once for all that His Majesty’s Govern ment will not abandon their established policy in the Persian Gulf in order that Ibn Saud may play with greater effect to pan-Arab gallery of whose intelligence they hold same estimate as Fuad. If King seriously intends to press this point, negotiations on frontier question affecting Anglo- Sahdi relations as a whole will arise. It is therefore essential to disabuse Fuad on this point without delay. 3. I approve generally of your language to Riad on His queries recorded in paragraph 4 mut■ of / possible thcit Ibn Saud allow Fuad his head in order this questionof enclosure in your despatch No.17 were Ti^ertinent. If he should again allude to promise given to Hussein (I assume he refers to McMahon ? 1916-17 correspondence) short answer is that in that correspondence His Majesty's Government expressly reserved their rights under their treaties with Arab Rulers of the Persian Gulf. These treaties have been officially communicated to Saudi Government. 4, While speaking generally in above sense with whatever degree of firmness you consider g necessary to drive home main points, namely refusal of His Majesty’s Government to be exploited in pan-Arab interests you may see fit to add that for their own part, as Ibn Saud is aware, His Majesty’s Government have constairtly been at pains to promote good relations between Arab States. It is for this reason that they attach particular importance to question of h uwa it Blockade, settlement of which they hope to negotiate with Saudi Government even if general negotiations are abandoned. 5. Scheme for general agreement proposed in parggr^ph 10 of your telegram under reference is being considered in connection with your despatch No.28 on which I hope to address you shortly. -Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs-61/31 &amp; 63/64 Telegram From XX His Majesty's Minister, Jedua.

In deference to your strongly expressed views His Majesty’s Government do not press that question of re-export should be raised with Shaikh of Bahrain, at any rate at this stage, though they feel some apprehension that one result of the inevitable abandonment of the AHMED I policy may be to give incentive for development of port on mainland which has hitherto been lacking, while it seems open to question whether local purchase of land by Qusaibis etc. may not be explained b^ increasing development of Bahrain as an oil centre. 3.
