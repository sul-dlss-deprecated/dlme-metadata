The Resident should be told that subject to any observations he may have to offer amounts paid by this Office on this account will be included in the Account Current for adjustment in India in connection with the accounts of the Residency. He might perhaps be asked whether it is desired that advice of payment should be sent to him. We should like to see the papers again when approval has been obtained. R.A. JAKES.ATT?
