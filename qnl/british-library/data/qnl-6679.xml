Agreement relating to Loan of 2,000,000Z., at 7 per cent., redeemable in Twenty Years. PREAMBLE: Contract between the British Government and the Persian Government with reference to an agreement concluded this day between the said Governments. It is agreed as follows :— Article 1.—The British Government grant a loan of 2,000,000L sterling to the Persian Government, to be paid to the Persian Government as required in such instalments and at such dates as may be indicated by the Persian Government after the British Financial Adviser shall have taken up the duties of his office at Tehran as provided for in the aforesaid agreement. 10 1313 50 4.20 AII. From these extracts it is apparent &lt; . . i “&gt; “ SK the achievement of the common interes 80 , expenses of reform (C) to the Persian (ioverument for aS in reform, civil and military, and the cost of equ.pment of the m Tkirsz^rsr w -*« *.«« Financial Adviser has taken up his duties in 1 ehran. fBy mutual consent of the Persian Prime Minister and His Majesty » Master this limitation was disregarded in respect of ati ms • ' /] oi 000/^ drawn in August immediately after the signatui e &lt; Agreement, paitly for the purpose of securing for it and the reforms a u good Press” in Persia.) ITT The subsidies still paid to the Persian Government in I ehran are : — („) For general administrative expenditure, Ts. 350,000 per month. Pus subsidy is composed of “ moratorium payments begun in an addition,i advance begun in 1918. The whole is recoverable from the lersian Government, hut does not bear interest. Its object is to make 1 ersian Government expenditure balance with receipts, which, without the subsidy, (6) For tire mamtomnce of the Persian Cossack Division, Ts 100,000 per month. This, which is equal to the amount found by the Persian Government monthlv for the maintenance of the Division, is a non-recoverable subsidy. It was started as a war measure to obviate the risk of internal disturbance which would result from the dispersal of the Division as a consequence ol inability to pay it. , . (c) A personal payment of Ts. 15,000 a month to the Shah, to be continued so long as he keeps Vossugh-ed-Dowleh s Cabinet in power. (d) A subsidy of Ts. 20,000 per month to the Persian Government was sanctioned in June 1919 for the maintenance of a force in Khorassan to guard against a possible Bolshevik invasion. What payments, if any, have actually been made is not clear from the information available. (Possibly payment is made by the Consul-General at Meshed to the Governor-General, by direct drawing on India.) It is apparent that the above subsidies are not such as could legitimately be regarded as advances out of a loan granted to enable a campaign of adminis trative reform to be carried on. Yet the second 1 2 and the fourth 2 have been sanctioned, for certain periods, only on the condition that they are regarded as advances out of the loan of 2,000,000/. ; and it is now proposed that a similar stipulation should apply to the first for two months at any rate. To the above list should be added the payment to the Governor-General of Pars of Ts. 45,000 (for three months at Ts. 15,000 per month) for the maintenance of the North Road Guards. This subsidy was not even one to the Central Government of Persia, and to allocate any portion of it against a loan to that Government is obviously improper, except with the specific consent of the latter, which was, however, not sought. Yet the last authorised instalment (for three months) of this subsidy, which has now lapsed, was sanctioned only as an advance out of the loan. 2 IV. Apart from the tendency, mentioned above, to allocate as “ advances out of the loan ” all sorts of payments to the Persian Government, there has been shown from time to time a similar tendency to expect that as soon as the loan becomes legitimately available on the arrival of the Financial Adviser in Tehran, 3 the need for the various subsidies now x&gt;aid for various services will cease to exist. 1 The Government of India were sceptical about the Agreement and its virtues throughout the negotiations. The Secretary of State for India, however, stated that he did not endorse the Government of India's view; and while the Government of India might with consistency decline to subscribe to the statement of policy in the preamble, it has been accepted by His Majesty’s Government as a whole. 2 See Statement attached. 3 See extract from “ Agreement relating to the loan of 2,000,000/.Article I. above. MIt is, surely, iinduly optimistic to expect that any Financial Adviser, however a ) e, wjII iind it possible m less than a month so to reorganise Persia’s revenue system, and so curtail expenditure, as to remove the existing excess of expenditure ovei receipts amounting to possibly Is. 4/0,000 1 a month. Unless the Financial Adviser is to be faced with a task utterly hopeless from the start, it is only fail' to allow him a considerable period before expecting tangible results ; and during this period it will be necessary that the subsidies provided lor the current needs of the administration should be continued — at, it may be hoped, a gradually decreasing rate. 1 he alternative, to which a decided inclination is apparent on the part of the Foreign Office under pressure of circumstances—is to devote the loan to current adminis trative expenditure; but this is to return to the procedure shown to be improper under the terms of the Agreements, and rendered no less improper by the fact of the Financial Adviser’s arrival in Tehran. V . These considerations affect principally the subsidy of Ts. 350,000 for general administrative purposes. With the substitution of “ Military Mission ” for “ Financial Adviser they probably apply equally to the subsidy for the Cossack Division, though for a much less period. The Military Mission submitted on 21st March 1920 definite recommendations for the disposal of the Division, but it will presumably be at least one month before effect is given to them. 2 For the maintenance of such part of the Division as is to be retained the sum of Ts. 100,000 found by the Persian Government monthly without outside assistance, may or may not suffice; if it does not, a contribu tion from the British Government might not unnaturally be demanded by the Persian Government. VI. if the British Government intends to follow out the policy indicated in the preamble to the Agreement of August 1919, and to endeavour to promote the progress and prosperity of Persia, the necessity must be faced of continuing to finance the country while the process of reform is in progress, in addition to financing the reforms themselves. It is thwarting any possibility of success that there may be to divert to improper uses what remains 2 of the loan of 2,000,000b ; and further, it is only fair to the policy as outlined in the Agreement that the allocations 3 already improperly made against the loan should be cancelled. 1 i.e., the combination of subsidies (a) (b) and (d) above. It is perhaps fair to include (6) still, for although the Military Mission has reported as to the disposal of the Cossack Division, the necessary measures can hardly be taken in a day. 3 This was written before Tehran telegram No. 190 of 9th April 1920 (F.O. reference No. 191109/34) had been received. 3 See Statement attached. 2 • 4 ) Political Department, India Office, 22nd April 1920. a 1313 A 2Statement 1 o!

The report relates to the Anglo-Persian Agreement of August 1919, to which was attached an agreement for the British Government to grant Persia a loan of 2,000,000
                           lsterling, at an interest rate of 7 per cent. The report provides extracts from these agreements before addressing the question of whether existing subsidies to the Persian Government (including a subsidy for general administrative expenditure, a subsidy for the maintenance of the Persian Cossack Division, a personal payment to the Shah, and a subsidy for the maintenance of a force in Khorassan 'to guard against a possible Bolshevik invasion') should be regarded as advances out of the aforementioned loan. The report advises that the loan should not be diverted to 'improper uses' and that any such allocations should be cancelled. It concludes by stating that if the British Government intends to endeavour to promote the progress and prosperity of Persia, then it must face the necessity of continuing to finance the country while the process of reform is taking place, in addition to financing the reforms themselves.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Political and Secret Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Loans</topic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Persian Agreement (1919)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00018c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
