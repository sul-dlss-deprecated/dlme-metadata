Two additional foliation sequences are also present in parallel between ff 1-162, and ff 144-162; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence between the Political Agent in Kuwait, and British Authorities in London and Iraq regarding the aerial survey of the Neutral Zone that lies between the Kuwaiti-Iraqi and Saudi Arabian borders.
