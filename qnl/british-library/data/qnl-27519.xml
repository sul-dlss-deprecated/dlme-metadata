Answer to Mr. Bay’s Question Ho. 4 dated 15th March, 1937. Parciculars of the treaties in question are contained in Volume XI of Aitchison’s Collection of Treaties, a copy of which is in the Library of the House. As regards the second part of the honourable Member’s question, the extent to which His Majesty's Government would employ armed forces to fulfil their obligations in respect of the protection of these States would of course depend upon the nature and extent of the aggression. Supplementary &lt; ueetion r Mr, Bays Can the hon. Member say whether these States have undertaken to supply any armed forces to the British ifimpire? Mr, Butler: That raises another question.Minut e. The answer to Mr.Day’s question is comparatively simple except for one point. The treaties with the Persian Gulf Rulers are included in Vol.XI of Aitchison’s Treaties, together with a precis of them. A copy of Aitchison is in the House of Commons Library and it is therefore quite easy for Mr.Day to dig out the information he wants. Aitchison, however, does not include the Engagement which was entered into with the Sheikh of Qatar in 1935 by which H.M.G. guaranteed him external protection against serious and unprovoked aggression by land. This, of course, is very relevant to the question of H.M.G.’s defence commitments, but so far as I can see the question of publishing this under taking was not gone into in 1935 and the tendency seemed to be to regard it as a private undertaking between H.M.G. and the Sheikh (particularly as it was in the nature of payment for the Sheikh agreeing to give an oil concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company). It may therefore be desirable to omit mention of it, and this can be done without actual falsehood since it is not a treaty and so, strictly speaking, it need not be included in the answer to the first part of Mr.Day’s question. The existence of this undertaking should, however, be borne in mind. A draft reply with note? for supplementary is Our obligations are to protect Koweit (without specifying land or sea, and therefore by implication from any form of aggression), to protect the/© the other places from aggression by sea, and in addition, in the case of Qatar, to a qaalified extent from aggression by land. The exchange of letters with Qatar of 11th May, 1935, is at flag A in the volome. The Sheikh was expressly informed that the protection would be afforded through the R.A.F., so that there is no undertaking to send ground troops to his assistance. The meaning of Lr. Jay’s insistence on the 'extent” to which H.M.G. 'have agreed to supply armed forces' is rather obscure. The best way of replying seems to be that proposed m the second paragraph of the draft.

In view of receipt of unsatisfactory Persian notes regarding relations between His Majesty's Government and Arab Sheikhs it may be preferable that communication of treaties should be deferred until these notes are dealt with.

O^O' I.y telegrams llos* 274 to 278.^ I anticipated that notes would in any case have been evasive and unsatisfactory on points of detail while habits acquired by present Minister for Foreign Affairs from addressing Iraqi Government may have something to do v/ith their tone. But I am quite sure that Persian Government would not have deliberately challenged our right to speak for Arab rulers or embark upon controversy over (? jurisdiction) exoept as result of extreme irrita tion over arrest of Mudii*. ^. But whatever their motive it seems essential that on his return this week Minister should make it quite clear to both Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs that unless they are prepared to cease questioning our interpretation of status quo and of legitimate function of Persian navy and customs launches there can be no resumption of treaty negotiations now or in the future and we shall consider ourselves free to take what steps we consider necessary to protect our ov r n interests and those of Arab rulers. 3. Apart from above oral corrmunication we'shall in due course have to send in brief ansv/ering notes to the effect that while facts will bo further examined with care statements of principle in Persian notes are unacceptable. 4, Further action if required can be left forc o ms i derat ion of His Ha.jesty’s I inister on arrival. 5, It is just possible that i inister for roreign Affairs who is evidently a foolish mn has an idea that by unburdening himself of all these notes on me now he will be able to start all square with if ' 's His Hajesty’s I inister. In tha.t case he will get severe shock if His . ajesty’s Minister holds language on the lines of paragraph 2 and it may bring him to reason. I believe that Persian Government are still genuinely anxious for a treaty and are building hopes on getting one though they probably imagine more generous terms than vie shall ever give them.

Please see Teheran telegram of 30th September No. 246 on P.Z. 6309/33. The treaties with the rulers of the Arab Littoral of the Persian Gulf which were communicated to the idshciraR Government in 1932 are set out in Foreign Office despatch No. 425 to Rome of 1932 on P.Z. 2691/32, flagged. We have already (September 1928) officially communicated to the Persians the text of our exclusive agreement of 1892 with the Trucial Sheikhs. The provisions of our agreement of 1899 with the Sheikh of Koweit were mentioned to them at an earlier stage in 1925 (P.Z.2527/25 | in connection with the Persian request to be permitted to establish a Persian Consulate in the Sheikh f s territories but the text does not appear to have been communicated. 2. Col. Loch is averse (see his telegram of 11th October to communicating the treaties to the Persians 1 or discussing our position on the Arab Littoral at all with them. I do not think there is any real substance in his objections (which Colonel Fowle was not inclined to take seriously). Admittedly the Persians have not yet formally recognised the independent status of the various Arab rulers, and it is indeed one of the objects of our treaty negotiations to persuade them to do so. On the other hand, particularly now that the advent of the Persian Navy has given rise to a series of incidents necessitating protests arising out of our special treaty relations with the Arab Sheikhdoms, there seems everything to be said for placing on record at Teheran, particularly in response to a Persian interest in the matter, the more important of our engagements with the rulers concerned. 3. It would, I think, suffice at the same timeto communicate the governing documents, i,e. Exclusive Agreement of 1892 in the case of the Trvcial Sheikhs (possibly with a reminder that these have already been communicated in 1928 officially), the Commercial Treaty of 1891 and the Exclusive Agreement of 1891 with the Sultan of Muscat, the Agreement of 1899 with the Sheikh of Koweit, the treaty of 1916 with the Sheikh of Qatar and the Exclusive Agreement of 1892 with the Sheikh of Bahrein. It is arguable that we might also communicate the treaties of 1820 with the various Sheikhdoms about the suppression of piracy etc., which contain^ an undertaking in rather vague terms by H.M.Gr. to protect the rulers concerned so long as they comply with their obligations to us. But on the whole I think we should do best to omit this and to take our stand on the leading agreements, whi are those specified above, more particularly if we do not communicate the undertakings we have secured from the various rulers as regards slavery, arms traffic, etc. 4. One point of some little delicacy arises, viz. whether or not we should communicate a copy of our agreement with the Sheikh of Bahrein. The Foreign Office were at first disposed to think that this had better be omitted. On the other hand I feel that it is very undesirable to do anything, even in small matters, to which the Persians could point as in any way a recognition of their claim to Bahrein, and the simplest course would seem therefore to be that Mr. Mallet should make his communication in an informal manner but should include the Bahrein treaty among those to be communicated/ chV Draft Paper.

We have carefully considered the objections stated in Loch’s telegram No. 893 of 11th October to the communication of our treaties with the Arab Sheikhdoms to the Persians. We are, however, of opinion that the L ^ balance of advantage'is definitely with their communication though we think it unnecessary to give the Persians a complete set of the engagements in question, and entirely agree with Mallet as to the objections to communicating -a copy q4 Aitchison. We would suggest, therefore, that Mallet should be authorise^)to communicate informally (in response to what appears to be a more or less informal interest on the part of the Minister of Foreign Affairs) copies of the following:- (1) Muscat . Gommercial Treaty of 1891. Exclusive Agreement of 1891. 1925(2) True i^L.. ^ Jagikhdoas. A specimen Exclusive Agreement of 189i*with a note that similar engagements have been entered into by the remaining Trucial Sheikhs whose names should be specified; and possibly, if it was thought desirable, a reference to tne fact that these engagements were officially communicated to the Persian Grovernment by Parr in September, 1928. (3) Qatar . The treaty of 1916. (4) Koweit . The Agreement of 1899. (You will remember that reference was made to the provisions of this Agreement in Sir P. Loraine f s Note to the Persians of 3rd July, 1925 in connection with their request to be granted consular representation in Koweit.) (5) The Exclusive Agreement with the Sheikh of Bahrein of 1892. 3. Mallet would no doubt make it clear in such way as he thought best that he was communicating copies of the most important documents and not a complete set of our treaties with the rulers concerned. 4. We have carefully considered the question whether it would be desirably to communicate a copy of the Bahrein Agreement of 1892. We do not, of course, wish to provoke a correspondence or a controversy with the Persians on the question of the status of Bahrein. On the other hand we think it most important, and we feel sure that you will agree, to give them no excuse, however small, for suggesting, particularly at the present time, that we in any way defer to or accept their^ view that Bahrein is a Persian possessionDraft Paper Department or that the Sheikh is not in independent treaty relations with H.M.Gk, and we feel that to omit the Bahrein treaty from a set of treaties such as the present might be liable to misunderstanding. Nor in our view if, as we assume is the case, the whole matter is to be dealt with on a rather informal basis, ought Mallet to have much difficulty in avoiding controversy on this point, to which he could no doubt make a friendly reference if he thought that desirable when handing over the texts of the treaties. 5.

Copy of to SEEN POUT u COMMITTEE. ' -4 AUG 1932 Previous Papers :— 29a 2000 5.31 FOR INFORMATION. I The Ambassador in Rome was authorised in Foreign Office despatch of 2nd May (on P.Z. 2619/32) to communicate to the Italian Government a series of agreements with the Arab rulers in the Persian , Gulf. We had previously communicated (Rome despatch of 10th December, 1931, No.916, on P.Z.7933/31) a memorandum summarising the situation in regard to our treaty relations with these rulers. 2. The memorandum communicated last December unfortunately stated that the Sultan of Muscat, like the other Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf, was precluded by his engagements with us from entering into correspondence, etc., with foreign States and that his foreign relations were the responsibility of His Majesty’s Government/rnaammmmam Government. This is, of course, incorrect, the Sultan being in a different category frcm the other Arab rulers and having treaties of his own with the United States and France and a commercial agreement with the Dutch Government. The Italians draw attention to this point in paragraph 2 of their note now submitted, and the Foreign Office are considering whether we should explain that our earlier statement was a drafting error. It is to be hoped that we shall not be faced later with an Italian demand to be represented at, or conclude a treaty of friendship with, Muscat: but the risk cannot be overlooked. 3* The statement in paragraph 3 of the draft Italian note, which at first perhaps reads rather ungraciously, need not, it is thought, be taken as representing more than a quite reasonable caveat. The general tone of the correspondence has throughout been friendly, and the Italians have emphasized their desire to co-operate with, and to avoid anything which might cause embarrassment to, us in the Persian Gulf.IQ- ■ v- : - ■ : ■ ; Ho. 819746/83.

In raply to Hla Britannic aaj«aty , a ^nbaaay'a Rota Verbal© no, 140 (113/5/3^) of the 10th May, the Koyal Ministry of Foreign Affaira have the honour to acknowledge receipt of the texts of the following agreements concluded between His Britannic Majesty's Oovwrnment and certain Arabian Sultanates of the Persian Julfs- (1) Agreement of the Oth March, 1692, with the Sultan of Abu Bhabl; (2) Agre«aent of the 3rd January, 1699, with the Sheikh of Koweit; (3) Agreement of the 13th March, 1892, with the Sheikh of Bahrein; (4) Treaty of the 3rd Hovember, 1916, with the Sheikh of &amp;1-Katr, In which agreements or treaties the aforementioned Sultana assumed, Inter alia , obligations towards His Britannic Majesty's aovernaant in regard to the establishment of agents of other government a In their territories; In the event of the cession, sale, mortgage and occupation of those territories; and finally (with the exception of the sheikh of ^owelt) as regards the ohannel which the &gt;ultans themselves undertook to employin their relations with foreign States* (6) Treaty of Friendship, Oo«Merce and Navigation of the 19th !4aroh, 1891, with the i ultan of Juacat and Oman, and supplementary Protocol of the 90th February, 1892.

The Royal Jilniatry of Foreign Affairs, in thanking His Britannic Majesty 1 ermbaasy for their courteous communication of the said treaties, have the honour to state that the Royal Government, while confirming their desire.

(It should be explained to the Italian Government that identical agreements have been concluded with all the other Tracial Sheikhs, namely the Chiefs of Dttbai, Ajman, Sharjah, Has-al-Khaima and Umra-al-Qaiwain, the first three dated the 7th, and the last two the 8th March 1892). (2) Agreement dated 23rd January 1899 withwith the Sheikh of Koweit 3* EitcluaiTe Agreement dated the 12th Inarch 1*392 with the Sheikh of Bahrein. 4. Treaty of the 3rd November 1916 with the Sheikh of kl-Katr. 5. Treaty of Jfriendahip, Commerce and Navigation, dated the 19th i,larch, 1891, with the Sultan of Muscat. 6. Agreement regarding the Cession of Territory by the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, dated the 20th Inarch 1891. 2. The texts in question are those of the principal agreements concluded with each of the ^rab Hulers and fully illustrate the memorandum already handed to the Italian Government in this connexion. In communicating them to the Italian Government Your Excellency may explain orally that numerous other published agreements, chiefly on specificspecific subjects, are in existence, and that Hie kajeaty's tfovernraent will be glad to dommunicate these aleo if the Italian Government so deeire. 3. The Italian Government should at the same time be informed in writing that British relations with these Arab Hulers rest not only on the agreements which have been concluded, but also on long-established custom and consent. 4. I also enclose herein for simultaneous communication to the Italian Government the texts of the following treaty provisions, which govern the frontier situation between Ira and Persia on the Shatt-el-Arab:- (a) The translation of an extract from the Treaty of Erzerum concluded between Turkey and Persia on the 31st May 1847. (b) The text of the Turco-persian Frontier jrrotocol concluded at Constan tinople in 1213. 5. I shall be glad if Your Excellency willwill explain to the Italian Government th^t, although the Italian memorandum of Jw the ^gch January did not refer specifi cally to thie aspect of the general question, I think that they may be interested to learn the treaty position in the Shatt-el-Arah, the waters of which will probably be visited from tine to time by Persian warships* You should add that so far as His Majesty*s Government are aware, the Constantinople Protocol has neverj^ yet been published* 6* Finally as regards the proposed general treaty with iereia, I shall be glad if you will inform the Italian Government that negotiations were temporarily suspended upon the termination of Sir Robert Clive's appointment, but that His Majesty's Government will be glad to furnish the Italian Government with the text of any treaty which may eventually be signed as a result of any resumed negotiations.ce to m^ice ariy supplementary cofriminlcatlon to the Italians on tae subject of tne iiiiatt-el-Arab, but It seeme to us that if, in response to their request, it Is ieclied to send them the texts of the agre'wnte w th the Arab rulers, we could include at the same time the relevant portions of the reaty of Krseroum end the Constantinople protocol, explaining tn&amp;t these Instruments govern existing i erso-Iraq relations in the snatt-el-Arab. ♦ie enould be glad to know whether in the altered circumstances you seeany serious objection to this suggestion Yours sincerely. v.. f OOLItalian Governments request for copieg of treaties with Arab rulers ; Please see P.Z.7933/31, flagged X, which gives the text of the memorandum handed to Signor Grandi by Sir R. Graham. The memorandum mentions the Arab Rulers by name and states that H.M.G. are under obligations to these Rulers to conduct their relations with all foreign Governments; consequently any Persian aggression could not be a matter of indifference to H.M.G. In acknowledging the memorandum, the Italian Government ask for information about the treaty being negotiated between Great Britain and Persia, and also ask that, as they have no information about particular agreements existing between H.M.G. and the Arab Rulers, they may be furnished in confidence with the texts of these agreements. We may agree with the proposal in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office letter to promise the Italian Goverrment the text of any treaty which we may conclude with Persia. We may also agree that it is desirable to return as cordial a reply as possible to the Italians, and that there is no objection to communicating the texts of the Arab treaties to them. All the main treaties are in Aitchison. The treaties in question are listed in P.G.13, a copy of the relevant sections of which is flagged K above , P.3020/28 on the file below. It will be seen that all the important treaties were communicated to the Turkish Govern ment in 1911, and to Ibn Saud in 1927. As the memorandum given to the Italian Government only mentions the conduct of foreign relations by H.M.G., it would seem sufficient to communicate to the Italian Government the Trucial Exclusive Agreements of 1892; the Koweit Agreement of 1899; the Bahrein Agreement of 1892; the/the El Katr Treaty of 1916 and the Muscat Treaty and Agreement as to cession of territory of 1391. The Italians might be informed that these are the main treaties dealing with the external relations of the States. Signor Grandi might also be informed that British rights in the Persian Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements which have been concluded, bub on the custom, consent and long established relationship of the Persian Gulf Chiefs and the Sultan of Muscat with the Government of India. This is taken verbatim from the communication made to Ibn Saud in 1927 - flagged J. M.J.Clauson. 20 / 2 .

MEMORANDUM The Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy’s confidential memorandum No.317/6/31 of December 9th, 1931, in which were set forth certain aspects of the situation in the Persian G-ulf regarding the relations between His Britannic Majesty’s G-overnment, the Government of India, the Persian Government and the Sultanates of the Arabian littoral. 2. \ftiile thanking His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy for this courteous communication, the Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, animated by the same spirit of friendly confidence which was responsible for the delivery of the memorandum, have the honour to state that the Royal Government have not up to now had any information regarding the particular agreements which, as appears from the above-mentioned memorandum, exist between His Britannic Majesty’s Government, the Government of India and the Sultanates on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf. They are, moreover, not au courant with the general agreement between His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Government of India on the one hand and the Persian Government on the other, which, as also appears from the memorandum, is apparently in process of negotiation. 3. The Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs would be grateful if His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy would be so kind as to represent to the Government in London that the Italian Government, in view of the relations of cordial friendship uniting the two governments, and of its intention to regulate so far as possible its own political action in thethe area concerned so as not to conflict with British interests, would he glad to he furnished in confidence with the texts of the existing agreements between the British Government, the Government of India and the Sultanates on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf, as also, in due course, of the general agreement which is being negotiated with the Persian Government, Rome, 25th January, 1932 - Year XI cfon P.Z. 7933/31.

Section 1. - (Received December 14. ) Rome, December 10, 1931. Sir, WITH reference to your despatch No.1291 of the 5th November, I have the honour to report that I took advantage of my first interview with Signor Grandi on his return from America to raise the question of the difficulties which might occur when the new Persian warships with their Italian officers reach the Persian Gulf. 2. Signor Grandi listened attentively to the outline of the position which I gave him, and said at once that there would be no difficulty in meeting the wishes of His Majesty* s Government. I said that it was desirable that the Persian Government should not get wind of these informal representations and he told me that I could rely upon him to arrange that there should be no leakage on the part of the Italian officers. 3. In order that Signor Grandi should have the facts at his disposal, I left with him at his request a confidential memorandum, of which I enclose a copy, based on your despatch. I have, &amp;c. (Sgd.) R. GRAHAM. Enelosure/Bnclogure in No. 1 . (Confidential. ) Memorandum on Certain Aspects of the Situation in the Persian Gulf as between His Majesty 1 a Government in the United Kingdom, the Government of India, and the Persian Government* HIS Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India are in treaty relations with the rulers of the territories along the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf, namely, the Sheikhs of Koweit, Bahrein, and El Katr, the Sultan of Muscat, and the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast - i.e., the Ras-al-Khaima, Umm-al-Q,aiwain, Ajman, Shargah, Dabai, and Abu Dhabi. His Majesty’s Government are under obligations to these rulers to conduct their relations with all foreign Governments, and consequently any Persian agression against the territories or islands of these rulers, any objectionable activities by Persian warships in their ports and territorial waters, or any unjustifiable interference with their vessels upon the high seas could not be a matter of indifference to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. The Persian Government do not at present recognise these Arabian rulers and have no diplomatic relations with them, although His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have endeavoured to secure their recognition by Persia as part of a general treaty settlement. The visit of a Persian warship to an Arab port would therefore, in present circumstances, scarcely be in accordance with ordinary international usage. The Persian Government have, further, ad vaneedclaims to sovereignty over certain Arabian islands in the Persian Gulf, including an antiquated claim to the Islands of Bahrein, which lie off the Arabian shore of the Gulf, and from which Persian troops were driven out in the year 1783 by the native Arab inhabitants. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom consider the Persian claim to the Islands of Bahrein to be entirely without foundation. For practically 150 years these islands have been ruled by independent sheikhs of the sameruling family, with whom, as independent rulers, His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India have been in treaty relations for over a century. Similarly, the Persian Government have raised vague claims to the small hut important Islands of Tamb and Abu Musa, both of which have been the property of rulers of the Trucial Coast for approximately 2CC years. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom regard these claims also as completely without f oundati on. Finally, His Majesty’s ships in the Persian Gulf have, for very many years, made use of a depot on the Island of Henjam, and of Basidu on the Island of Kishm, for refuelling purposes, and for the recreation of their crews. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom have offered, as part of a general treaty settlement with Persia, to renounce their rights of Basidu, and to regularise by a lease the position at Henjam. Negotiations for a general settlement are already advanced, and, pending a final solution of these questions, the Persian Government have undertaken to observe the status quo.

Precis of the Treaties and Engagements between the British Government and the Chiefs of the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. KOWEIT. (a) Agreement dated 23rd January 1899 —The Sheikh pledged himself and his neirs and successors not to receive the Agent or Representative of any Power or Government at Koweit . . . without the previous sanction of the British Government . . . and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage or give for occupation or for any other purpose any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power, without the previous consent of His Majesty’s Government. (b) Letter from Lieut.-Col. Meade, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 23rd January 1899, accompanying (a):—The Sheikh was formally assured “ of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors as long as you, your heirs and successors scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond (i.e. the agreement above).” Note— In 1911, when the text of the Agreement of 1899 was com municated to the 1 urkish Government, the text of Col. Meade’s accompanving letter was not similarly communicated; but the Turkish Government was told in Sir E. Grey’s covering note that “His Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the Agreement, His Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices. His Majesty’s Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.” The attitude adopted at the time by His Majesty’s Government towards this undertaking is illustrated by the following extract from India Office letter dated the 30th October 1911 to the Foreign Office“The term ‘ good offices ’ ... is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is. neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by Bis Majesty’s Government in 1901-2, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises.” (c) Agreement of the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 24th May 1900, to prohibit the importation of arms into, and their exportation from, Koweit. (d) Postal Agreement, dated 28th February 1904, giving His Majesty’s Government the sole right to erect a post office at Koweit. (e) Secret Agreement, dated 15th October 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore.—In the fifth article of the two documents constituting the agreement the Sheikh reaffirmed his pledge not to cede, sell, Ac., any Koweit territory to any foreign Government or foreign subject without His Majesty’s Government’s permission. In the ninth, the British Government promised that “the town of Koweit and its. boundaries belong to . . . the Sheikh of Koweit and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mubarak’s arrangements in the matter of customs, Ac., and his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the hands of Sheikh Mubarak-as-Subah, ruler of Koweit, and his heirs after him ...” Note— The lease, or rather the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikh site, was terminated in 1922. It does not appear, however, that the agreement was abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges, so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments, presumably remain binding. 3138 75 10.28 P. 2585/26.

He gave a similar undertaking as regards oil in 1913. ' •' (g) Letter dated 3rd November 1914 from the Political Resident to the Sheikh, in which the Sheikh was given, in return for his co-operation against the Turks, certain assurances of which the third was that “ Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.” (/i) The undertakings given to Sheikh Mubarak were renewed in 1917 to his son Jabir, and again, on his accession, to the latter’s successor, his brother Salim. To Salim, who proved troublesome, Government in 1918 gave a warning that the assurances conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour. (See Memorandum on Koweit on page para. 20.) (i) In a Kharita delivered on 19th July 1921 the Viceroy renewed to the present Sheikh, Ahmad al Jabir, nephew of Salim, the assurances given to the latter. Aitchison, Vol. XII, p. 172. Do., p. 178.

(a) In 1820 the Ruler of Bahrein subscribed to the general treaty with the Arab Chiefs of the Persian Gulf, which prescribed abstention from plunder and piracy by land and sea, from slave traffic, and from inter-tribal war, and peace with the British Government. (The adherence of Bahrein to this treaty gave the British Government a formal right to intervene, as it did in 1863, between Bahrein, Abu Dhabi and Katr, and again in 1867-9.) (b) In 1817 the Sheikh of Bahrein subscribed to an engagement for the abolition of slave trade in his ports and for the submission of Bahreini vessels to search by British cruisers for slaves, and to seizure if guilty, and in 1856 signed a further engagement for the better suppression of the slave trade. (c) On the 31st May 1861 Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifa signed on behalf of himself and his heirs and successors a “perpetual treaty of peace and friendship with the British Government.” In Article 2 he agreed to abstain from maritime aggression, rear, piracy and slavery by sea “ so long as I receive the support of the British Govern ment in the maintenance of the security of my own possessions against similar aggressions directed against them by the Chiefs and tribes of this Gulf.” In Article 3 he undertook to refer to the arbitration of the Political Resident cases of aggression by sea on Bahrein or Bahreinis and to refrain from retaliation without the Political Resident’s assent. “ And the British Resident engages that he will forthwith take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury ... by sea upon Bahrein or . . . its dependencies.” (d) On 22nd December 1880 Sheikh Isa signed an agreement binding himself and his successors not to enter into negotiations with any State or Government other than the British without the consent of the British Government, and to prevent the establishment of diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots, other than British, without the consent of the British Government. “This engagement does not apply to or affect the customary friendly correspondence with the local authorities of neighbouring States on business of minor importance.” (c) On the 13th March 1892 Sheikh Isa signed a further agreement the first two articles of which reaffirmed his undertaking to abstain from relations with foreign Governments; in the third article he undertook “ on no account to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory save to the British Government.” (/) In 1898 the Sheikh of Bahrein signed an agreement to prohibit the traffic in arms in Bahrein territory. P. 711/98.(g) In 1911 the Sheikh agreed not to allow any foreign Power to open a Post Office in Bahrein, and not to grant a pearl fishing or sponge fishing concession to foreigners. In 1914 he agreed not to search for oil himself or give others permission to do so without consulting the Political Agent and receiving the approval of the Government of India. EL-KATR. (a) In 1868, as a result of hostilities initiated in Katr by the Sheikh of Bahrein in co-operation with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and continued by a retaliatory attack on Bahrein by Katr, Sheikh Mahomed bin Thani executed an agreement to abstain from hostilities and to accept the arbitration of the Resident, particularly in disputes as to the tribute payable to the Sheikh of Bahrein, to whom the Sheikhs of Katr were then in some degree subordinated. (b) Shortly after, the Turks established themselves in Katr; and though the British authorities did not hesitate to have direct dealings with the Sheikhs of Katr, no written agreement was made with them. (c) In the course of the negotiations with the Turkish Government in 1913 it was agreed that the southern and eastern limit of “ le Sandjuk Ottoman de Nedjd” should be a “ une ligue partant du fond extreme du golfe faisant face ii Pile de Zahnounie (i.e. the Bay of Salwa to the west of El Katr) qui ira directement an sud jusqu’au Ruba’-al-Khafi et separera le Nedjd de la presqu’-ile de PEl-Katr.” Further, it was agreed that “ le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste Britannique—ne permettra pas an cheikh de Bahrein de s’immiscer dans les affaires interieures d’el-Katr, de porter atteinte a Pautonomie de ce pays ou de Pannexer.” (d) The separation of El Katr from Nejd and its independence of Bahrein having been thus established (though not thereby given effect), the way was open for the conclusion of a Treaty signed on 3rd November 1916 after the Turks had finally been expelled from El-Katr in the course of the war. In this treaty the Sheikh takes note of, undertakes the obligations a resulting from, and is promised the advantages accruing from the various engagements concluded by the Trucial Chiefs for the suppression of slave trade and piracy and the preservation of the maritime peace. In Article III he undertakes to prohibit arms trade in Katr and to •observe the arms traffic rules of the British Government. In Articles IV and V he undertakes to have no relations with the Agent of any other Power without the consent of the British Government, or to •cede land by lease, sale or gift or to grant monopolies, concessions or cable landing rights. In Articles VII, VIII and IX he undertakes to protect British residents and, if required, receive a British representative, and establish a British post and telegraph office. In return the British Government undertakes in z\rticles X and XI to protect the Sheikh, Ids subjects and territory from all aggression by sea, and to grant their good offices should he or his subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Qatar ; it being understood that this obligation only applies in the event of such aggression by land or by sea being- unprovoked by the Sheikh or his subjects. Note.— From para. 10 of the Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs on p. 88 V will be seen that on the question being raised by the Sheikh in 1922 of the assistance which he might expect from Government in the event ■of an attack by Ibn Sand, he was informed that His Majesty’s Government were not prepared to promise more than diplomatic assistance. TRUCIAL COAST (Ras-ul-Khaima, Abu Dhabi, Dabai, Shargah, Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain). (a) In 1820 these chiefs signed the general treaty (see Bahrein (a)) prescribing perpetual abstention from plunder and piracy by land and sea. and from irregular (i.e. unproclaimed) 'war; registration of dhows; peace with the British Government; abstention from the carrying off or transport of slaves; free entry of their ships into British ports; “and if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of it.” * * “ Them ” in the context appeal s to mean the ships of the signatory Chiefs; but it may mean the Chiefs.(i) In 1891 an agreement was also signed by the Sultan, pledging him never to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give in occupation any of his dominions or dependencies, save to the British Government. (;) In 1895 a guarantee was given to the Sultan that, whatever the differences between the Sheikhs of Oman and the Sultan, Government would not allow the former to attack the two towns of Muscat and Mattrah. The Sultan issued a notification in these terms. The warning was renewed in 1913. (k) In 1898 a proclamation was issued giving British and Persian vessels the right to search British, Persian or Muscat vessels in Muscat waters, and Muscat vessels in British or Persian waters, for arms and ammunition. (l) In 1902 the Sultan undertook to grant His Majesty’s Government the first option on mining rights in the Sur coalfields. (m) In 1903 the Sultan issued a notification authorising the searching by British and Italian ships, both on the high seas and in Muscat waters, of Muscat vessels suspected of carrying arms to certain prohibited African areas. (?/) In 1923 the Sultan undertook not to give any oil concession without the consent of His Majesty’s Government. (ii) Treaties with other Powers. (a) In 1833 the Sultan concluded a Treaty of Amity and Commerce with the United States of America providing for perpetual peace, unrestricted trading (except that muskets and ammunition might not be sold to private persons in Zanzibar), limitation of import duties to 5 per cent., reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment in regard to trading charges, and appointment of consuls. (b) In 1844 a Treaty of Commerce was concluded with France in terms almost identical with the British Treaty of 1839. (c) In LSI 7 a short I reaty with Holland provided reciprocal most-favoured nation treatment for the nationals of* each country, both generally and in respect of import duty and the regulations regarding export and transit.

He has also been informed of the “good offices” accorded to Koweit. and of the provisions of Article 9 of the Bunder Shweikh Agreement. F.O. tel. 186, Sept. 4 1928. 3. To the Persian Government.

Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. 21st March, 1928 Sir l MAR 1928 I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to transmit to you the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Jeddah, concerning a request of the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs to be supplied with \ certain documents. 2. Subject to the concurrence of the Earl of Birkenhead Sir Austen Chamberlain proposes to deal with this request in the following manner;- (1) Anglo-Turkish Treaty of 1906 . Dr. Damlu j i is presumably referriiig to the exchange of notes of May 14/15, 1906, (see Egypt No. 2 (1906) Cd. -3006) supplemented by a delimitation agreement of October 1st, 1906, (State Papers Volume 99, page 482) regarding the Turco-Egyptian (Sinai Peninsula) boundary. As these documents have already been published, the Secretary of State sees no objection to Mr. Bird being supplied with them for presentation to Dr. Damluji. (2) The Anglo-Turkish Treaty of 1913 has never been ratified or published, though a reference to Article 5 of that treaty is contained in the Nejd-Koweit agreement of December 2nd, 1922. Its communication to the Kejaz Government appears to the Secretary of State to be undesirable on general principles, and in particular by '•reason of tne further documents to which it refers and with which (exception being made of the Agreements between Great Britain The Under-Secretary of State India Office.Britain and Xoweit of 18 9 9, 1900 and 1904 already communicated to the Hejaz Government) Dr. Damluji would presumably request to je supplied. Sir Austen Chamberlain therefore proposes tnat Dr. Damluji should be given only a copy of Article 5 of tne Anglo-Turkish treaty of 1913 and of the map attached to * the Convention, these being the parts of the treaty in which Ibn Saud’s Government has a direct interest. (3) Agreement with Koweit. 1913 . It is not clear to what agreement Dr. Damluji refers, and the Secretary of State proposes to obtain further particulars on tliis point. In order to meet the request of Dr. Damluji recorded in paragraph 2 of Mr. Bird’s despatch, arrangements are being made to supply to t-ie Hejaz Government, through His Majesty’s Consul at Jeddah, copies o f any papers likely to interest that government which may be prepared by this department for presentation to Parliament. 4.

Dr. Damluji also states that the Mecca Foreign Office wishes to become a subscriber to Government publications interesting the Near East. I am unaware whether a subscription of this nature is possible or whether a separate order would be required for each publication. 3. In order to facilitate Dr. Damluj i»s task you might perxiaps consider the possibility of furnishing me, for the use oi the Foreign Office at Mecca with an additional copy of white papers supplied to me.

Your Excellency, After respects, With reference to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird*s letter No.905 M of September 15 to His Majesty the King on the subject of the existing treaties and agreements between His Britannic Majesty*s Government and the various rulers and chiefs in Arabia and on the Persian Gulf, I am directed by His Britannic Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to send herewith for the information of His Majesty (1) A collection of treaties and agreements with the Sheiks of Koweit and Bahrein and the Trucial Chiefs. ^ (2) A Treaty of November 3, 1926 with the Sheikh of Katr. (3) A collection of agreements with the Sultan of Muscat. (4) The treaties of 1915 and 1917 with the Idrisi of Asir. I am at the same time to request that Your Excellency will be good enough to explain to His Majesty that His Britannic Majesty’s Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the agreement of 1899, His Britannic Majesty’s Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices, but at the His Excellency The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mecca.the same time His Britannic Majesty^ aorermrent hare reserved to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion. His Britannic Majesty's Government have also assured the Sheikh that they recognise: (1) that the town of Koweit and its boundaries belong to him and to his heirs after him; (2) that all his arrangements shall remain in the hands of himself and his heirs, and, (3) that they will not take customs or anything in any lands they may rent, or in which they may dwell, within the limits of Koweit. Finally His Britannic Majesty's Government have assured the Sheikh that Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection, I am further to request that Your Excellency will be good enough to remind His Majesty that British rights In the Persian Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements which have been concluded, but on the custom, consent and long established relations of all the Persian Gulf Chiefs and the Sultan of Muscat with the Government of India, As regards the treaties with the Idrisi of Asir, His Britannic Majesty's Government regard the treaty of 1915 as having expired and (that^ as regards the treaty of 1917, His Britannic Majesty's Government hold the view that the expression 'Foreign Power' employed therein does not include Arabian rulers.

Sir, *0 py to Ind ' Sir 1827' » k Foreign Office. S.W.l. 3rd September, 1927 n With reference to Colonial Office letter No. 49008/27 of August 2nd and your letter No. P.3429 of July 26th, relative to Ibn Saud’s request to be supplied with copies of all existing treaties and agreements between His Majesty’s Government and the various Rulers and Chiefs in Arabia and on the Persian Gulf, I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to transmit to you the accompanying draft of a despatch to His Majesty’s Agent and Consul at Jeddah, and to enquire whether the Earl of Birkenhead concurs in its terms. 2. It will be seen that the suggestions contained in the two letters mentioned above have (with certain exceptions indicated below) been embodied in the draft. 3. The Secretary of State has now reconsidered the question concerning the validity of the treaties of 1915 and 1917 with the Idrisi in the light of paragraphs 4 to 6 of the Colonial Office letter and paragraph 7 of your letter. 4. Sir Austen Chamberlain agrees with Mr. Amery that the treaty of 1915 must be regarded by His Majesty’s Government as having lapsed, and he proposes to inform Ibn Saud accordingly. He is not, however, disposed to qualify this statement with the words w except in so far as an ^obligation still rests upon His Majesty’s Government to w adjudicate between the rival claims of the Idrisi and the •'Imam if and when an opportunity offers'. The 1915 treaty provided / The Under Secretary of State, India Office.provided for such adjudication M at the conclusion of the 'war'; and it cannot, in Sir Austen Chamberlain’s opinion. be contended that this obligation still persists in 1927. Moreover, the adjudication of His Majesty’s Government has never been sought, and in the unlikely event of its being in demand, it could be proffered irrespective of any formal engagement contracted during the war. The Secretary of State therefore trusts that Mir. Amery and Lord Birkenhead will agree to the omission of the qualifying phrase from the proposed explanation to Ibn Saud. 5. As regards the treaty of 1917, it will be seen from paragraph 5 of the draft enclosed herein that Sir Austen Chamberlain accepts Mr. Amery’s proposal to inform Ibn Saud that in the view of His Majesty’s Government, the expression H Foreign Power” employed in that treaty does not include Arabian Rulers. On the other hand, while sharing Lord Birkenhead’s view that it is desirable to decide whether and how far the 1917 treaty is to be regarded as binding upon His Majesty’s Government, he is reluctantly forced to the conclusion that no such decision can be taken at present. His Majesty’s Government undertook by that treaty to protect the Farsan Islands and the Idrisi’s seaboard, to afford the then Idrisi assistance with war material both during and after the war, to vouchsafe him various commercial facilities, and to offer him asylum in the event of a crisis in his country. The Idrisi with whom the agreement was signed is no longer the ruler, and has had more than one successor. When the present Idrisi appealed to His Majesty’s Government to implement their undertakings and to assist him with material against the Imam, His Majesty’s Government took the line that their engagements only applied in the event of aggression by an European Power. They have on various occasions declined to help the Idrisi, with the result that that /that ruler, threatened by the Imam and the Italians, was driven to place himself under the protection of Ibn Baud - a step which he now appears to regret. He can therefore hardly be expected to retain any illusions regarding the validity of his agreement with His Majesty’s Government, the original object of which was to keep the Italians out of the Jarsan Islands; and he has ceased to serve the purpose which His Majesty’s Government had in view, since he has virtually surrendered his sovereignty over the Farsan Islands (as well as the rest of his dominions) to Ibn Baud, and His Majesty’s Government have reached an understanding in regard to those islands with the Italian Government* Ibn Baud having now assumed towards the Idrisi the engagement to protect his territory and seaboard, it is questionable whether the similar engagement of His Majesty’s Government can persist, more particularly since His Majesty’s Government have, in the Idrisi’s view, declined to carry it out. It can, on the other hand, be argued that if His Majesty’s Government formally denounced the agreement, the Idrisi would be absolved from any obligation not to make over the Islands to a foreign Power, namely Italy, which is now endeavouring to detach the Idrisi from Ibn Baud and to bring his territory under the control of the Imam. It is thus conceivable that His Majesty’s Government might at some future date wish to appeal to the Idrisi’s engagement not to cede the islands, although he would have some justification for repudiating it in view of recent events. In these circum stances, Sir Austen Chamberlain considers it best to leave the 1917 treaty in its present condition of suspended anima tion, without endeavouring to solve the problem whether it has or has not actually expired, and to continue to fornulate their /their Arabian policy in accordance with the necessities imposed upon them by the constant changes in the political situation. 6* As regards the question raised in paragraph 3 of your letter, it is not altogether clear whether the political clauses (5 and 9) in the secret agreement of 1907 with the Sheikh of Koweit are or are not to be regarded as still in force. This question depends on whether it was the intention of the parties that their continuance should be dependent on that of the lease provided for in the treaty. The text of (xfy '\ the agreement appears, however, to indicate that clauses 5 and 9 were not intended to have that effect, and that those clauses (and also any other provisions of the treaty which can continue to operate despite the termination of the lease) are still in force. The Secretary of State gathers that it is desired to regard the state of affairs created by clause 9 as still continuing; and that position seems to be almost identical with that resulting from the assurances given to the Sheikh on November 3rd, 1914. In these circumstances the action proposed in paragraph 3 of your letter appears to Sir Austen Chamberlain appropriate; and instructions in the sense indica ted have been embodied in paragraph 3 of the draft despatch to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird. 7.

The Secretary of State will be glad to receive the observations of the Earl of Birkenhead regarding the r’epiy which should be made to this request. The position appears to be as follows. , 3. A collection of treaties and agreements with the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein and with the Trucial Chiefs of Chian, copy of which is enclosed herein, was communicated to the Turkish Representative in London on October 24th, 1911. This collection was printed as an annex to the Anglo-Turki sh Convention of July 29th, 1913, respecting the Persian Gulf and adjacent territories; and as all the treaties etc. included therein have been published in ’’A itch ison ’ s Treaties”, there can be no objection to Ibn Saud being supplied with copies thereof. 4. IS ■8. A — — i o f»v f V i r vl a / Uuit . / 4. in communicating these documents to the Turkish Representative, His Majesty’s Government intimated that they had informed the Sheikh of Koweit that, so long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the Agreement of .1899, His Majesty’s Govemment under took to support them and accord them their good offices, but at the same time His Majesty’s Government reserved to themselves the right to interpret that tern at their discretion. The Turkish Representative was further informed that His Majesty’s Government held a lease from the Sheikh of Koweit. °regards the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Trucial Ghiets of Oman, His Majesty’s Government took occasion to remind the Sublime Porte that British rights in the Persian Guli rind on the coast rested not merely on the agreements concluded and transmitted at that time to the Ottoman Govemment, but on the custom, consent and long-established relations between the local Chiefs and the Government of India. these ci rcumstances it seems desirable that the substance of the two preceding paragraphs of this letter should be communicated cq Ibn Saud at the same time as the documents mentioned in paragraph 3 . 7 - While, as already stated, the Turkish Govemment v.ere inlomed oi the existence of the lease held from the Sheikh of Koweit, the secret agreement with the Sheikh, dated October Ibth, 1 907, the text of which is given on pages 3-8 of the printed volume en clo sed herein ^ was not communicated to them, uca i o is therefore a matter for consideration whether it should now be given to Ibn Saud.6 . There are also the following agreements concluded with certain Arab Chiefs during the wa.r: - Agreement of February I9th,l f ^l5 with the Shefkh of Mavia. Treaty and letter of November 3rd,1916, with the Sheikh of SI Katr. Treaty of April 30th, 1215, with the Idrisi Sayyid. Treaty of January 22nd, 1917, with the Idrisi Sayyid respecting the Farsan Islands. There is apparently no need to communicate to Ibn Saud the Agreement of February 19th, 1915, with the Sheikh of Mavia, since it seems clee.r that this agreement is no longer in existence. The instrument in question was only an agreement for mutual assistance during the war, and it seems probable that the provisions of article 4, in regard to the protection to be afforded to the Sheikh, were only intended to apply during the continuance of ho st il iti es. In any case, the agreement can never have been carried out, because it appears that, soon after its conclusion, the Sieikh joined forces with the Turks and therefore failed to fulfil his obligations under the agreement. 10. The Treaty with the Sheikh of SI Katr is in a different position. It was not a 'war agreement' at all, but an agreement on the ordinary lines of the other conventions between His Majesty’s Government and the Trucial Chiefs; its terms provide for the relations between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government in noxmal times, and appear to have been intended to be permanent. it was ratified in March 1918 and there does not appear to be any reason for not regarding it as still in force. 11 ./W-. s, ( c|i5 11. The question whether the treaties of 1915 and 191? ■between His Majesty’s Government and the Idrisi can still be regarded as effective has already fomed the subject of previous correspon iencc with this department ending with Colonial Office letter Ho. 48021/27 of February 11 th. Since that date the position has been further examined and the two treaties have been compared with the text of the Agreement concluded between I bn Saud and the Idrisi on October 21st last. 12. As a result of this examination Sir Austen Chamberlain considers that the question v^iether the 1915 Treaty can still be held to be effective turns on whether, and if so, to what extent, His Majesty’s Government are still under an obligation o use every diplomatic means in their power to adjudicate 'between the rival claims of the Idrisi and the Imam Yahia or 'any other rival.' As was pointed out in paragraph 5 of Foreign Office letter of January 20th to Colonial Office it seems as if this obligation was intended to be fulfilled in the course of the peace settlement. To what extent it can oe said chat thi s was done appears open to question; but in any case Sir Austen Chamberlain is advised that the obligation can hardly be regarded as one which was to persist for ever, and it seems co him uhat it is co some extent affected in practice by the obligation which the Idrisi has since acce ted 'not to ' en u e r into political, negotiations with-any Government' except with the sanct ion of Ibn Saud. 13. As regards the 1917 Treaty, it is clear that in so far as His Majesty’s Government arc concerned, the I'on Saud- Idrisi Treaty must be regarded as res inter ali os acta, and that the position of His Majesty’s Government under the Anglo- Idrisi Treaty cannot in law be affected by it. But in practice itit oeern s aif f icuxt uo dsny tlia.t th.© new treaty does liavo some effect on the commitments o f His Maje sty * s Government. If the phrase in article 2 of the 1 917 treaty, hereby the Id r isi»s i.i depen _en ce was assured in all of his domains, is regarded as involving a guarantee on the part of His Majesty’s Government, this guarantee must in practice be affected by the fact that under the new treaty the Idrisi has consented to some limitation of his in' eponfence. Again, the undertaking of His Majesty’s Government to protect the Farsan Islands and the Idrisi’s seaboard xrom all hostile action cannot be entirely unaffected in practice by the obligation which Ibn Saud has now accepted to do the seme thing. Finally, article 2 of the Ibn Saud- Idnsi Agreement seems to prevent the Idrisi from entering into any political negotiations with His Majesty’s Government without Ion Scaua’s consent; and this circumstance may in practice have sane effect on the position under the 1917 treaty. 1 4# The ( l ue st ±on has hitherto been one mainly of academic interest, but it appears to Sir Austen Chamberlain that, unless His Majesty’s Government are prepared to admit definitely that tne two treaties in question are no longer operative, it is necessary to communicate them to Ibn Saud. if 0 n the other hand vhis is the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, it seems desirable that Ibn Saud should be informed accordingly, since it is probable that he is already acquainted with the existence, it not the tenns, of the treaties in question. lo. I p m to request that the enclosures in this letter may be returned to this department with your reply. 16# A s:5inila r letter is being sent to the Colonial Office.

Sir G. Clayton to Sir Austen Chamberlain. Sir, Foreign Office, June 6, 1927. I HAVE the honour to submit the following report on my recent mission to Jeddah for the purpose of negotiating a treaty with the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd. Journey to Port Sudan. 2. I left London on the 15th April, 1927, for Marseilles, where I embarked on the Bibby Line steamship “ Lancashire,” arriving at Port Sudan on the 24th April. I was accompanied from London by Mr. S. R. Jordan, and Mr. G. Antonius joined the mission at Port Said on the 21st April. Delay in 'proceeding to Jeddah. 3. On arrival at Port Sudan I received a telegram from His Britannic Majesty’s consul at Jeddah informing me that Ibn Saud was not expected in Mecca before the 4th May. I therefore decided that Mr. Jordan should proceed to Jeddah in H.M.S. “ Dahlia ” on the following day, while I remained for a few days in Port Sudan, accompanied by Mr. Antonius. I considered this arrangement desirable as I did not wish the mission to risk losing dignity by waiting about at Jeddah and affording material for local gossip and intrigue. Journey to Jeddah. 4. On the 1st May I embarked with Mr. Antonius in H.M.S. “ Dahlia ” t.Co m - mander Cotton, R.N.), arriving on the following morning at Jeddah, where I was received with due ceremony by the Hejazi authorities and conducted to His Britannic Majesty’s consulate. Arrival of Ibn Saud in Jeddah and Reception of Mission. 5. The arrival of Ibn Saud in Mecca was still further delayed until the 7th May, and he did not reach Jeddah until the morning of the 9th May, on the afternoon of which day the mission was received in audience by the King. The meeting was restricted to the usual exchange of greetings and compliments, and was marLed by great cordiality and friendliness on the part of the King, who insisted that the mission should leave the consulate and occupy a house on the outskirts of Jeddah which he caused to be prepared for its reception. Initiation of Negotiations. 6. On the following day conversations began, and are given in detail in a subsequent despatch. Main Points at issue. 7. It was evident from the results of the conversations at Wadi-al-’Aqiq, conducted in December last by Mr. Jordan and Mr. Antonius, that the main questions at issue were— (a.) Recognition of the special position of His Majesty’s Government in mandated territories. (6.) Mutual recognition of national status. (c.) Retention of the right of manumission of slaves by His Majesty’s consular officers. (d.) The tlejaz-Transjordan frontier. The first two questions appeared to present no difficulty, as His Majesty’s Government had consented to meet Ibn Sand’s point of view in both cases. It was to be anticipated, however, that the requirements of His Majesty’s Government in respect of manumission and the Hejaz-Transjordan frontier would meet with strenuous opposition, and this forecast proved to be correct; indeed, at the close of the sixth meeting agreement was not yet in sight. 4004 [16248] [16350] ' bggHHHH 2 Private Interview with Ibn Saud—and his Attitude. 8. At this stage, however, Ibn Saud requested a private and personal interview with me, at which matters came to a head. He assured me that he appreciated fully the reasons for the attitude taken up by His Majesty’s Government, and begged me to believe that it was his earnest wish to meet their wishes in every possible way; he^^ was, however, in a very delicate position, especially in regard to the Hejaz-Transjordar^^ frontier, and to sign the protocol at the present juncture would be to expose himself to violent criticism not only by his enemies, but also by his friends; moreover, he had many difficulties to contend with in his task of consolidating the position which he had won, and he could not afford to undermine his own prestige or do anything to alienate his friends and strengthen his enemies. In conclusion, somewhat to my surprise, he said that he had now come to me, as a trusted friend, to ask my frank and impartial opinion as to his best course of action, and was prepared to accept and act upon my advice. Sir G. Clayton s Advice to Ibn Saud. 9. I replied that His Majesty’s Government had decided that they must retain the right of manumission and were also determined to maintain the Hejaz-Transjordan frontier as defined in the draft protocol. Unless these two points were adequately safeguarded, no treaty was possible, and I had no hesitation in saying that, in my opinion, a rupture would react very unfavourably on his interests and those of his country. I strongly advised him, therefore, to meet the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. Ibn Saud accepted my advice, and appealed to me to find a way in which the requirements of His Majesty’s Government could be met with the minimum of injury to his own position and prestige. Slave Traffic. 10. I did not feel able to suggest any solution of the question of the slave trade other than that of the insertion in the body of the treaty of an article by which Ibn Saud would undertake to co-operate, as far as practicable, in its suppression, supplemented by an exchange of letters making it clear that His Majesty’s Government would continue to exercise the right of manumission by their consular officers. Frontier Question. 11. The question of the frontier, however, required fuller consideration. I could, perhaps, have induced Ibn Saud at that stage to sign the protocol, and I felt it very desirable to reach a definite settlement without delay. On the other hand, his arguments against this course were cogent, and it was obviously undesirable to force him into a really difficult position; moreover, I was convinced that it would be better, in the interests of future co-operation and good relations, to. ensure that the treaty should be signed in a spirit of real amity and confidence than to leave behind me a feeling that it had been concluded in an atmosphere of coercion as opposed to one of mutual agreement. Exchange of Letters re Frontier Question. 12. I therefore decided in favour of a solution on the lines of paragraph 11 of my instructions, and informed Ibn Saud that, while still maintaining that signature of the draft protocol was the most satisfactory course to follow, I was ready to accept an exchange of letters such as would recognise adequately the position which His Majesty’s Government had decided to maintain. Ibn Saud held by his promise to accept my advice on both points, and went as far as to say that, if I would draft the necessary letters, he would sign them, an understanding which he duly fulfilled. Question of Nationality and Tribunals. 13. Agreement now appeared to have been reached on all the more contentious questions and it only remained for Mr. Antonius and Ibn Saud’s advisers to settle various minor points in sub-committee and to draw up the final draft. During the discussions in sub-committee, however, an unexpected difficulty arose. Ibn Saud’s advisers tried by all possible means to extend the scope of article 6 in such a manner as to involve a complete renunciation of the Capitulations by His Majesty’s Govern ment, and finally they informed Mr. Antonius that the King would be unable to sign* the treaty unless I agreed to renounce the Capitulations or, at least, to inform him in writing that His Majesty’s Government would raise no objection if he were to abolish them by proclamation.Negotiations at a Deadlock on the Question of Capitulations. 14. I saw I bn Sand the next morning and, finding that his advisers had described the situation correctly, I informed him categorically that I was unable to accede to his demand. He remained firm and insisted that he could sign no treaty unless t e tts’uHsdictioii of his courts was fully recognised in all cases, both civil and criminal, am in regard to foreigners as well as natives. I urged that His Majesty s Government had already made a great concession in article 6 and begged him to reflect before he wrecked the treaty by persisting in a demand to which it was beyond my power to accede ; but he refused to give way and a rupture appeared almost inevitable. Solution of the Capitulations Dijficulty. 15. Mr. Antonins then had one more private interview with Dr. Abdullah Damluji and Sheikh Hafez Wahba in the hope of finding some solution at the eleventh hour, and it transpired at length that there had been a misunderstanding and some confusion of ideas in the King’s mind. . Article 6, far from being regarded as a concession, had given rise to grave suspicion in the minds of Ibn Saud s advisers, who interpreted it as an attempt to obtain recognition of the principle of Capitulations under the guise of a concession in regard to a specific portion of them. Ihey had communicated their suspicions to the King, who, having hitherto maintained the attitude of ignoring the existence of Capitulations altogether, immediate!} became alarmed and took up an extreme attitude. Conclusion and Signature of Treaty. 16. The situation was now clear and Ibn Saud s advisers, having been reassured as to the intention of His Majesty’s Government, suggested that the elimination of the offending article and the addition of a vague, and I consider innocuous, sentence at the end of article 5 would probably secure agreement. I saw the King the next morning and proposed this solution, to which he agreed at once. The final text was then prepared and the treaty was duly signed and the letters exchanged on the evening of the 20th May, at the conclusion of a dinner which the King gave in honour of the mission. The texts are enclosed herein. Questions outside the Scope of Treaty, 17. I will now explain the action taken in regard to certain questions which are dealt with in my instructions, but which do not fall within the compass of the treaty. Vosition of Iraq. Jji paragraph 6 of my letter of instructions I was dnected ^o explain to Jbn Saud the position of the Iraq Government and to proceed to an exchange of notes recognising that, while Trac] is outside the scope of the treaty, His Majesty s consular officers in the Hejaz and Nejd may afford protection to Iraqis in those territories so long as Iraq does not herself maintain representatives there. Postponement of Iraq Question. 19. I had intended to deal with this question after conclusion of the negotiations, and I did not anticipate that it would give rise to any difficulty. Unfortunately, the question of nationality and that of tribunals, dealt with in articles 5 and 6 of the draft treaty, had produced a very acute situation, and T was con\mced that if 1 laised the question of Iraq I should once more provoke grave, even though unfounded, suspicion and probably wreck the treaty irretrievably. I therefore decided that it was necessary to postpone the question for the present. It is a question of fact and not of negotiation, and can properly be communicated through the usual official channels to the Government of the Hejaz and of Nejd at some convenient time, possibly when the exchange of ratifications takes place. Hejaz Nationality Law. 20. b'or similar reasons I thought it unwise to discuss the objections put forward bv His Majesty’s Government to certain articles in the Hejaz Nationality Law, promulgated on the 29th September, 1926. The matter is not one of immediate urgency, and will be better dealt with by His Majesty’s consul at Jeddah after the treaty has been ratified. 16248] B 2m € Removal of Embargo on Import of Arms, 21. I explained to Ibn Sand that His Majesty’s Government were pf opinion that the supply of arms was a question which could not properly he dealt with m t e o y of the main treaty. This question has been made the subject of an exchange o e ers between Ibn Sand and myself on the lines laid down in my instructions. ^ Hejaz Railway. 22. Ibn Sand raised the question of the Hejaz Railway, and l informed him that, for practical reasons, it had not been possible to give effect to his request that the railway should be put in order for this year’s pilgrimage ; but His Majesty s Govern ment were discussing the matter with the French Government with a view to the necessary steps being taken to secure the reopening of the railway in time for the pilgrimage of 1928. The King, after expressing the earnest hope that every effort would be made to secure the operation of the railway before next years pilgrimage, asked to be given, as soon as possible, a statement of the situation up to date, and to be kept fully informed as to the progress of negotiations. He added that he presumed that he would be given the opportunity of nominating a representative to the conference which must be held with a view to arranging a final settlement, and asked to be furnished, in good time, with all the details and information necessary for a thorough study of the question. Awqaf-el-Haramain. 23. I discussed with the King the question of the Awqaf-el-Haramain, and explained to him that it was contrary to the invariable principle of His Majesty s Government to interfere in religious matters or in the decisions of religious, or even of civil, courts. His Majesty’s Government, therefore, regretted that they did not see their way to exerting any influence to assist him in obtaining the revenues of W akfs, which he maintained should be devoted to the upkeep and improvement of the sanctuaries of Islam at Mecca and Medina. Ibn Saud replied that he appreciated and respected His Majesty’s Government’s point of view, but he thought that his request for assistance in this matter had perhaps been misunderstood. He had no wish to ask His Majesty’s Government to interfere in religious matters or in the operation of courts, either religious or civil. He proposed to apply through the proper channels for those Wakf revenues which he considered should be paid over to him, and, if necessary, to bring actions before the competent tribunals. All he asked of His Majesty’s Government was that they should help him, as far as possible, to obtain justice in cases where unfair influence might be exerted against him and his claims unjustly blocked by refusal to furnish necessary information or by other methods. He asked that His Majesty’s Government should reconsider his request in the light of these explanations, and make a further communication to him as soon as possible. He also requested that he might be assisted by being furnished with— (a.) Information as to what Awqaf-el-Haramain existed in India. (6.) Advice as to the proper steps to take with a view to preferring and establishing such claims as he might wish to make. (c.)

Departure from Jeddah and Return to England. 24. On the 21st May the mission paid an official farewell visit to the King and then embarked on the Italian steamship “Nasarro Sauro,” arriving at Suez on the morning of the 24th May and proceeding to Cairo on the same day. Five days were spent in Egypt in liquidating the business of the mission, and on the 29th May I embarked in the P. and 0. steamship “ Ranpura,” accompanied by Mr. Jordan, arriving in London, via Marseilles, on the 4th June. Mr. Antonins remained in Egypt and returned thence to Jerusalem. Thanks to Local Authorities. 25. I cannot close this report without placing on record the extreme kindliness of our reception by the King and all the officials of his Government with whom we came in contact. Everything possible was done for our comfort and convenience, and the negotiations were carried out in an atmosphere of extreme friendliness and good humour.V y 5 Staff. \ 20. In conclusion, I desire to testify to the services rendered by my colleagues on the mission, Mr. S. R. Jordan and Mr. G. Antonius, whose previous work at Wadi-al-’Aqiq was of great assistance in clearing the ground and enabling me to form a just appreciation of the situation. Mr. Jordan afforded me valuable help at all times and placed his local knowledge and experience unreservedly at my disposal. I have had occasion, in connection with previous missions to the Hejaz and the Yemen, to bring the services of Mr. Antonius to the favourable notice of His Majesty’s Government, and will only add now that his intimate knowledge of Arab language and psychology, combined with a clear understanding of the questions at issue, was quite invaluable and contributed in no small measure to the results achieved. I have, &amp;c. GILBERT CLAYTON. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Treaty with the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd.

Your Majesty, IN continuation of our conversations relating to the question of the slave trade, I have the honour to inform your Majesty that His Britannic Majesty’s Government feel it their duty to abstain at present from renouncing the right of manumitting slaves, which has long been practised by His Majesty’s consular officers, and which enables them to liberate any slave who presents himself of his own free choice with a request for liberation and repatriation to his country of origin. I wish to assure your Majesty that His Britannic Majesty’s Government’s insistence on this right is not intended to mean any interference in the affairs of your Government or any infringement of your Majesty’s sovereignty ; but that it is due to His Britannic Majesty’s Government’s resolve to carry out a duty which they owe to humanity. I would add that His Britannic Majesty’s Government will be prepared to consider the8 ■ftti abolition of tlie right of manumission as soon as it becomes clear to both parties that the co-operation stipulated in article 8 of the Treaty of Jeddah has resulted in t e enforcement of such practical measures as to render the exercise of the right or manumission no longer necessary. * n t * . &gt; I trust that your Majesty will appreciate the attitude of His Britannic Majesty s^ Government in this matter and that you will see lit to acquiesce in the piocedure vine - I have described above.

Cox, I.A., C.I.E., Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your office endorsement No. 2179 and of your First Assistants letter No. 21FO, dated the 9th October 1907, forwarding copies of Foreign Office telegrams addressed to Secretary of State, and dated, respectively, 24th September 1907 and 4th October 1907 and 8th October 1907, and the telegraphic reply from the Secretary of Sfate, dated 2nd October 1907, on the subject of the negotiations for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh lands. 2. I have now the honour to report that the lea3e was duly signed in my presence by Sheikh Mubarak and witnesssed by his son, Sheikh Jabir, and delivered to me on the evening of the 15th October. The Arabic original of the lease has been forwarded direct to the Foreign Secretary with translation and a copy of this letter, as directed in Foreign telegram, dated 15th August, to my address, forwarded under cover of your office confidential endorsement No. 1775, dated 17th August 1907. 3. A true copy of the lease has been retained by me in my personal custody for record, and I trust that by next mail I shall be able to forward a copy thereof to you. A translation accompanies this letter. 4. On the same evening, I signed the acceptance of the lease and delivered the original acceptance to Sheikh Mubarak. An Arabic copy of the acceptance, with translation, has been forwarded to the Foreign Secretary and an Arabic copy has been retained by me in my personal * Forwarded herewith. custody and a copy * will be forwarded to you by next S. G. Knox. mail. A translation accompanies this letter. 5. I trust that the papers will be found in order except for the unfortunate addition, which I shall endeavour to account for in the following paragraph. The somewhat curious wording of the condition in clause 3 of the lease and acceptance, introduced in accordance with the direc tions contained in the Secretary of States’s telegram of date 2nd October, was due to Sheikh Mubarak who seemed a little doubtful as to whether he was not committing himself to the lease for an annual rent of Rs. 60,000 of all the lands, mentioned anywhere in the agreement. If it has any special effect, it would seem to mean that, even should the British Government determine the lease, they would still retain their right to take the other lands on lease, in pre ference to other applicants. 6. At my first interview with Sheikh Mubarak on the morning of the 11th October, the full effect of the telegraphic comments on the Warba proposal had unaccountably escaped me, and I mentioned the concession as one of the additions to the agreement which His Majesty’s Government wished inserted. The proposal was favourably received. On my return, I at once detected my error and found myself in the unpleasant dilemma of showing vacillation which might arouse suspicion or of doing more than I had been ordered to do. After giving the matter much anxious consideration, I decided that the latter was the preferable course and, in drafting, left the Warba concession rather vague. I trust that, as apparently the concession does not bind Government in this particular direction in any way, the oversight may be pardoned, while, at the same time, I venture to express my profound regret for the carelessness which gave rise to it. 7. Sheikh Mubarak, during one of my interviews with him, showed some anxiety about payment, and indeed, for one moment, I thought that he was going to insist on the first pavment before he signed the agreement. I asked him how he would like it paid, and he expressed the wish that it should be paid in Bombay to his Agent Mohamed-us-Salim-us-Saderavi, Sitaram Building (H) Block, Bombay. I do not know if this man is a well known Bombay merchant, but he could be. traced immediately by application to Messrs. McKinnon McKenrie &amp; Co., Agents for the British India Company at Bombay. It would, I venture to think, be an advantage, if he could be paid the first year’r. rent with as little delay and formality as possible, and I would request that I may be favoured with information by telegraph of the payment that I may communicate the news to Sheikh Mubarak. 8. In conclusion, I have the honour to commend to your favourable notice the services of my Arab Moolla, Abdulla bin Abdul Ilahi, who has been of the greatest assistance to me in preparing the drafts of the lease and acceptance. The negotiations have now been proceeding for seme months, and I have not heard the least whisper from outside of the negotiations which goes far to show that he has been absolutely faithful to the trust reposed in him. Withthe necessity for continued secrecy, it might be inconvenient to recommend him for a title or a medal. I would, therefore, recommend that an English letter acknowledging his services might be addressed to him by yourself, accompanied, if possible, by the sanction of one month’s extra pay. I could meet this expenditure from Secret Service funds at my disposal. Could the letter and sanction reach me before the Id Ramthan, the gift on that day or on His Gracious Majesty’s birthday would be especially graceful. I would see to it that there was no publicity. Postcript to letter No. 551, dated the 16th October 1907, from Major S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit, to Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., I.A., Resident and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. It may be useful to place on record that, when the agreements were exchanged, the Accept* ance of the lease signed by me was read over by the Sheikh’s Secretary, Abdul Aziz bin Salim bin Badar, to Sheikh Jabir bin Mubarak, who before affixing his seal in witness to his father’s seal, verbally approved the agreement, and asked if the agreement to which his seal was being affixed, i.e., the lease, corresponded with the one that had been read over to him. He was informed that it did, mutatis mutandis. The Sheikh turned to his son and said that everything that suited the British Government suited him. To this Jabir agreed, only adding, rather ungtaciously at such a moment, “ pro vided that they do not do anything to injure Koweit interests.” He followed this up however with “ But we shall certainly not allow anyone else to interfere.” [ Secret and Confidential.] Translation of lease of the Shweikh lands.

MEMORANDUM ON BRITISH COMMITMENTS TO THE SHEIKH OF MAYIA. SHPRKH BIN NASIR MUKBIL of Mavia is the most important local ruler on the Turkish side of the Aden-Yemen border, as laid down in the Anglo-1 urkish Convention of the iith March, 1914. “ His jurisdiction extends from Kataba (on the plateau) down to Sheikh Said, and he can control Ahmed Noman in tliat neutral zone. * The neutral zone referred to is of course the ^ ellow Area of the 1914 Convention, which is of vital strategical importance in connection with the control of the Red Sea, and which Turkey pledged herself not to alienate. Mavia was thus recognised by us as falling within the sphere of lurkish sovereignty, and he held Ids chieftainship, with a stipend, as a lurkish kaimakam (21661/15). His Majesty’s Government's negotiations with Mavia were started at a later stage than those with the Idrisi, at a date when Turkey had already intervened in the war, and when the Imam’s intention of adopting a neutrality unfriendly to Great Britain had become more or less apparent. Mavia took the initiative by writing a letter to His Majesty’s Resident at Aden, which was reported bv the latter in a telegram of the 17th December, 1914 (84480/14):— “ Powerful Sheikh Ibn Nasir Mukbil, hereinafter to be styled Mavia, writes praising our goodwill to Arabs and desire of pact between himselt and Abdali Sultan, provided that we guarantee his independence thereafter. I have just received deputation of Mavia’s agent and the influential Haj Ali Nasir al Kamarani .... Mavia and Abdali Sultan wish to make an offensive and defensive alliance, which would gain support of all our protected chiefs. If backed by us, and his independence under us guaranteed, Mavia will break away from Turks at once.’’ This was commented upon as follows by the Government of India in a telegram of the 20th December, 1914, to the India Office (87080/14) :— “ The proposed alliance between Mavia and Abdali, although it is not usual in the case of protected chiefs, should, we consider, be countenanced in the special circumstances, and the independence of Mavia, under the protection of Great Britain, at the close of the war should be guaranteed by Government. It should be made clear, however, that at present we have no intention of giving these chiefs support in offensive operations, but will merely help them to protect and pacifv their territories by granting them arms, ammunition, and money, and that, unless Sheikh Said is used for the purpose of making an attack on Perim, we shall take no further action against it.'’ On the 28th December, 1914, the India Office telegraphed in regard to this to the Government of India (1395/15) :— “ Your proposals are approved I understand from Resident’s telegram that Mavia may be expected to get the Turks out of Sheikh Said.” On the 2nd February, 1915, however, the Turks invaded the Aden Protectorate, and the effect of this development upon our negotiations with Mavia was discussed by the Resident in a telegram dated the 8th February, 1915 (15601/15) :— “ Turks and Imam’s troops crossed the frontier and were encamped within 7 miles Dala 2nd February. Amir Nasir is with Turks. He has been deposed by his people, who are prepared to resist invasion, but urgently press for assistance of arms and ammunition and presence of our troops. I can supply arms and ammunition. * Telegram of the 17th December 1914, from the Resident at Aden, in 84480/14. [938] Bo “ I have interviewed Mavia’s confidential agent to-day. He is n^dy to conclude an agreement with our tribesmen to attack Turks, and asks rupees. This sum might well be spent in view of Government grant to udrisi of^ 55,000 rupees for the same purpose. If grant sanctioned, propose payment at my discretion as scheme develops. He states if no assistance given him he cannot take action against Turks. He might, in my opinion, on the other hand, be com-^ pelled by Turks to fight against us, in which case we must move out of^ Aden l^j his assistance and that of our own friendly tribes on our borders. Since lurks are now over our border, 1 would strongly recommend as a better alternative to paying the money to Maria that a British force of one brigade of infantry and one mountain battery should be sent to Dala F have no doubt such an advance on our part will call in all our tribes as well as Mavia, who would fight with us in defence of their interests. Situation is entirely changed since the Lurks crossed the frontier, and it is now imperative for British prestige among our protected tribes that the British should take action and lead them against the lurks, and not leave it to Mavia, a Turkish Arab, to do.” On the 9th February, 1915, the Resident telegraphed further as follows (16539/15) :— “ If Government will render assistance as asked for in above-mentioned telegram, Mavia can certainlv squash this movement, but I still consider it better for our troops to go up, as this step would be more likely effectually to check movement.” This telegram was repeated by the Viceroy to the India Office on the 10th February, 1915, with the following comment (16539/15) :— “ We have.informed Political Resident that no reinforcements, either permanent or temporary, can he sent from India, except in the case of extreme disorder. A sum of 75,000 rupees has been placed at his disposal to enable him to subsidise chiefs inside and on borders of protectorate, including Mavia. We have suggested that Mavia should not receive more than Idrisi.” Further developments were reported by the Viceroy in a telegram of the 22nd February, 1915 (21661/151 :— “ Political Resident at Aden explains position of Mavia more difficult thai^i that of Idrisi, as former is a Turkish pasha in receipt of Turkish stipend and on actual Turkish soil, while latter is free from Turkish attack. Mavia undertakes to drive out Turks and Turkish Arabs from Liwa of Taiz, including Kazas of Kataba, Kamaira al Hagariya, Mokha, that is, from Kataba down to Sheikh Said. He will further expel Turkish forces now within our borders at Dala and Jubbal Jihaf. Resident is concluding terms with Mavia on lines approved by your telegram of the 28th December, but in view of Imam’s attitude and likelihood of his joining Turks, as also possibility of fight being prolonged and aims of Mavia not being fulfilled, advocates his being authorised to promise extra pecuniary assistance to Mavia if move rendered imperative to secure co-operation in expulsion of Turks. As governor-general, Yemen, is reported to be proceeding to Ibb and Turks are in possession of Dala and plateau and have ascended Jubbal Jihaf, Resident considers Mavia should strike at once. We have therefore placed further 50,000 rupees at Resident’s disposal and have authorised his giving Mavia assurance within this limit, but have directed that before making any further promise he should satisfy himself that Mavia is seriously carrying out his engagements.” The agreement referred to in this telegram was actually signed at Aden on the 19th February, 1915, Sheikh Haj Ali Nasir al Kamarani acting on Mavia’s behalf as his plenipotentiary. l'he text was enclosed in a despatch from the Resident, dated the 23rd February, 1915 (50398/15). A copy is appended to the present memorandum, buta summary of the provisions may be given at this point. Article 1.—The Resident to pay Mavia 75,000 rupees in instalments, the first instalment of 25,000 rupees to be paid over at once, through the Sultan of Lahej, the remainder at the discretion of the Resident and the Sultan in proportion to the work done by Mavia. Article 2.—His Majesty’s Government will pay further subsidies, in excess of the 75,000 rupees, at their discretion, if the above sum appears insufficient for the expulsion of the Turks and their Arab allies from the Liwa of Taiz.\ ?0 3 Article 3 .—His Majesty’s dovernment will not treat separately with any g A rab/'Syief in the Liwa of Taiz,- but will assure them, if necessary, that they “ must be suu. missive to ” Mavia. Article 4.—\\ hen tl»e fighting is over arid Sheikh Muhammad Nasir (of Mavia) has gained the upper hand in the Liwa of Taiz, the British Government shall then recogni-e tire chieftainship of Sheikh Muhammad Nasir and his independence. They Undertake to place him under their protection and to protect him from the aggression of .my Eutopean Power or from the Turks. Article Mavia undertakes to break with the Turks from this date, to open hostilities against them upon receipt of the first instalment of the British subsidy, and not to desist until he has expelled both them and their Arab allies from the Liwa of Taiz (limits specified). Article 6.—Mavia undertakes to remove Sheikh Kayid Saleh from the limits of the Aden Protectorate (which he had invaded at the instigation of the Turksi, and to secure his co-operation for the objects of Article 5. Article 7. In case the lurks in Liwa of Taiz surrender to Mavia on condition of being deported to some other Turkish territory, the Resioent agrees to Like charge of them and carry out such stipulation after the termination of the war. On the 13th March, 1915, the Government of India instructed ihe Resident at Aden regarding this agreement as follows (50398/15) :— Ihe agreement concluded by you with the representative of Mavia is approved generally by the Government of India. It should, I lowever, be made d^r to Mavia that the guarantee given him uuder clause 4 is dependent on the obligations under clauses 5 and t&gt; being wholeheartedly carried out bv him, and that it should also be clearly underwood that the agreement can only be ratified on this condition.” In a telegram of the same date (50398/151 the Viceroy informed the India Office l 11 T 1 ) S® nera l way both of the terms of the agreement and of the Government of India’s instructions to the Resident. Relation of Commitments to the Sheikh of Mavia to British Desiderata. The Agreement of the 19th February, 1915, with Mavia is presumably annulled by the fact that Mavia shortly afterwards joined forces with the Turks. His Majesty’s Government may therefore consider themselves free of all commitments under this agreement for the present, but it does not follow that the agreement should not be taken into account in the peace settlement. In the first place there is some evidence that Mavia’s return to Turkish allegiance was meiely due to necessity. So long as the Turks occupied the Aden hinterland and invested us within the walls of Aden town he could hardly take any other course, and it may well be true that he has never ceased to prefer relations with usA And, in the second place, he might, if loyal, provide a valuable counterpoise in the Yemen to the Imam of Sanaa, wbose pretensions are very great. It w&lt;&gt;uld hardly be in His Majesty s Government’s interest to allow the Imam to establish authoi-ity over the plateau of Kataba and the lellow Area on the coast, which are b &gt;th positions of tie gieatest strategical importance. A minor chief like Mavia would be preferable as l i nel £ 1 )0Ur k® re - H we decided to retain him, the question wmuld arise whether we should recognise his independence, on the lines of article 4 of the 1915 Agreement (replacing the agreement by a Irucial Treaty in stricter form), or whether we should treat his failure to observe the agreement as a ground for giving him less favourable The alternative would be to make him a “protected ” chief instead of an indepen dent trucial chief, and to include his territory within the boundaries of the Aden Protectoiate, instead of leaving it as one of the States of Independent Arabia. • i ^ ha\ e a fiee hand to do this under article 10 of the Anglo-French Agreement ^ t i —^ ^ a y.’ an d it is unlikely that any opposition would be ofiered by the Idrisi or King Husein, to both of whom we are pledged not to extend our possessions in Arabia beyond the status quo. The question is almost certain to arise in the course of future negotiations with the Imam, and he alone is likely to offer violent opposition. oififr'cuuia.i j oi uuu jun msu crovernment. |&gt;38] B 24 r l he conduct of Mavia since the Turkish occupation of the Aden hinterlaiui is recorded in a memorandum by Colonel Jacob dated the 10th May, 1916 (Ind'JB':Office, Secret, B23I, 1916) “The Mavia Sheikh concluded an agreement on the 19th February, 1915. He tried to do his part, but we did not correspond. Had we done so, the move to Lahej would have been forestalled. Mavia has never taken an active part against us. His arrival on the Dala plateau was the result of the Amir’s coqir tting wii the Kaimakam of Kataba. Mavia deposed the Amir and put up a relative. He t hen changed his quarters and went to Mavia. A brother of* the present Ahdali Sultan was deputed to meet him at Musemir. The house of Abdali, however, did not approve of the £ Mavia agreement.’ The Abdali did not want to see a strong ruler in that quarter under our flag, which was the programme we had proposed, and to which Mavia had assented. The Abdali mission failed on acc&lt; unt of the maladroitness of its representative. Mavia would not lead the attack on Lahej, pleaded sickness, and was eventually put on the Turkish black list as pro-British. He was not present at the occupation of Lahej, and has ever since then been moving about in the neighbourhood of Mavia, while once, to deceive the Turks, he led another movement on the the Dala plateau, this time against the Shairis.” In an earlier memorandum, dated the 9th September, 1 915 (1 55634/15), Colonel Jacob summed up the situation with regard to Mavia as follows :— IbnNasir Mukbil—known as Mavia—has foiled us. He expected to he kept in his tract of Kumaira and Shurman under our aegis. He dislikes both Turks and Imam. His adhesion to the Turkish cause—the result, I believe, of force majeure, and also some diffidence in his mind of our bona fides, since we did not move up to meet him at Dala—though not necessarily indicative of any hostile animus against us, will put him into a difficult position with ourselves when peace is concluded. His country is very fertile and rich, as is also that of Hujariya, to the south, which also Ibn Xasir Mukbil’s influence pervades, and even so far south aoB as Sheikh Said. This country the Imam will covet. It should properly be ours, in spite of our declared policy to hold aloof.” 1 his quotation appears to cover the main points that will have to be taken into account when the time for settlement comes. APPENDIX. Text of Agreement of February 19, 1915. I his agreement is made between Major-General I). G. L. Shaw, Political Pesident, Aden, on behalf oi the Great British Government, and Sheikh Haj Ali Nasir al Kamarani, on behalf of Sheikh Muhammad Nasir Mukbil, Kaimakam of Shurman and al Kama-ira. ^ 1. 1 he Political Resident, Aden, undertakes to pay to Sheikh Muhammad Nasir Mukbil the sum of 1 5,000 rupees by instalments. The first instalment of 25,000 rupees shall be paid at once through Sultan Sir Ali-bin-Ahmed-bin-*Ali, K.O.I.E., of Lahej. The remaining instalments will be paid according to the discretion of the Political Resident as advised by the said Sultan, and they both will fix the amounts to be paid on each subsequent occasion. The sums which will be paid shall be deter mined both by the extent of the work already done by Sheikh Muhammad Nasir Mukbil and by that also which remains to be done by him in the future. 2. Should the sum of 75,000 rupees prove insufficient for the end in view, viz., the expulsion of Turks or their Arab allies both of the Shafai and also the Zaidi creeds—who are actually co-operating with the (urks, from the Liwa of Taiz, the British Government undertakes in the same way to give still more monetary assistance in such quantity as may to Government seem sufficient and essential. 3. Should any of the chiefs and sheikhs in the Liwa of Taiz call on the Political Resident dining the duration of the fighting, and demand to be detached from the control of Sheikh Muhammad Nasir, the Government (British) should assure such chief that he must be submissive to Sheikh Muhammad Nasir, and should decline to accept his overtures. 4.

The portion of territory bounded on the North by this line and which is bounded on the West by a low mountainous ridge called Shaq (Esh Sbakk) and on tbe East by tbe sea and on the South by a line passing from West to East from Shaq (Esh Shakk) to ’Ain al ’Abd (Ain el Abd) and thence to the coast north of Ras al Mish’ab (Ras Mishaab), in this territory the Governments of Najd and Kuwait will share equal rights until through the ffood offices of the Government of Great Britain a further agreement is made betwxen Najd and Kuwait concerning it.

Please see your memorandum No. 52-S,, dated the 4th April 1923, giving cover to a letter from the Shaikh of Kuwait, dated 17th Shaaban 1341 (4th April 1923) in which he is understood to claim the frontier of Kuwait with ’Iraq to he as follows:— From the intersection of the Wadi El Audja with the Batin and thence northwards along the Batin to a point just south of the Latitude of Safwan ; thence Eastwards passing south of Saf'wan wells, Jcbel Sanm and Um Qasr, leaving them to ’Iraq and so on to the junction of the Khor Zobeir with the Khor ‘Abdullah. Shaikh Ahmed at the same time claims as appertaining to Kuwait the Islands of Warbah, Buhiyan, Maskan (or Mashjan), Failakah, Auha, Kubba Qaru and Um-el-Maradim. The Shaikh can he informed that his claim to the frontier and islands above indicated is recognised in so far as His Majesty’s Government are concerned. As you are aware it is, in so far as it goes, identical with the frontier indicated by the Green line of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of July 29th, 1913, but there seems no necessity to make special allusion to that document in your communication to the Shaikh.

His Britannic Majesty's Commissioner and Plenipotentiary. Translation. Bahra, 14th Rabi‘ Thani 1344 (1st November, 1925). Your Excellency, In the Agreement relating to Trans jordan and Nejd provision is made for an undertaking on our part not to fortify Kaf or to make it a military centre. In one of our conversations, I asked Your Excellency to elucidate the meaning of “ fortifications,” and you explained that the construction of a wall round the villages concerned, according to the custom prevailing in the desert for the prevention of thefts and raids, as well as the construction of a military barrack for the housing of Public Security troops and the placing of a gun or a few machine-guns according to the require ments of public security, would not be considered as being fortifications of the kind which we undertook to abstain from erecting; but that such works would be considered as necessary for the preserva tion of order. The object of the present letter is to obtain clear confirmation of that from Your Excellency so that we should be perfectly explicit about our undertakings and leave no room for such misconstructions as might arise from the intrigues of mischief-makers. Respects. ‘ABDU’L-‘AZIZ IBN ‘ABDU’R- RAHMAN IBN SA‘UD.*S'*V Gilbert Clayton, etc.. His BHtannic Majesty's Commissioner and Plenipotentiary, to His Highness*Addu'l 'Aziz ibn 'Abdu'r-Rahman al-Faisal Al Sa'ud, Sultan of Nejd and its Depen dencies, Bahra Camp, 2nd November, 1925. Your Hjgiiness, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th Rabi‘ Than! 1344 (1st I^ovcmber, 1925) relating to the interpretation of Article 2 ol the Hadda Agreement. In reply to Your Highness’ enquiry, I would confirm the verbal statement I made in a recent conversation with Your Highness, namely, that it is difficult for anyone to define, fully vtnd in detail, what is to be understood by the word “ fortification ” in such a manner as to cover all possible eventualities; and that the best interpretation of that Article would be that which conforms to the spirit as to the letter of the Agreement, and rests on a sincere execution of its terms. Bor instance, if you desire to erect a wall, as is usual, or barracks for Public Security men other than military forces, or a small gun or a few machine- guns intended to repel brigands and aggressors, it will undoubtedly be open to you to do so, proviued such preparations do not exceed the bounds of what is re quired for the maintenance of order, and do not constitute, in the judgment of the British military authorities, a menace to Trans-Jordan. I have, etc., GILBERT CLAYTON. His Highness Sultan 'Abdn l-'Aziz ibn *Abdu*r-Rakman al-Faisal Al Sa'ud, Sultan of Afijd and its Dependencies, to Sir Gilbert Clayton, K.B.E., etc., His Britannic Majesty's Commissioner and Plenipotentiary . Translation. Bahra Camp, 15th Rabi‘ Thani 1344 (2nd November, 1925). Your Excellency, With reference to the discussions which have taken place concerning traders who30 are subjects of Trans-Jordan, I am not aware of an established and customary road used for passage through the VTadi Sirhan by traders from Trans-Jordan. Should it appear, however, that subjects of Trans-Jordan have an established and acknowledged right, recognised by those who are expert in such matters, to ply their trade from Syria and Trans-Jordan to the southern portions of Trans-Jordan by way of the Wadi Sirhan, then we hereby undertake to extend to them the same treatment as is extended to subjects of Nejd by the Government of Trans- Jordan in their transit to and from Syria.

The decisions of this tribunal shall be final and executory. (ft) When the tribunal has fixed the responsibility, assessed the damages and losses resulting from the raid, and issued its decision in that respect, the Govern ment to whom those found guilty are subject shall execute the aforesaid decision in accordance with tribal customs, and shall punish the guilty party in accord ance with Article 1 of the present Agree ment.

Presented by His Highness the Sultan of Aejd after the sixth meeting to S*r Gilbert Clayton, K.H.E., etc., His Britannic 31ajesty*s Commissioner and Plenipotentiary. Translation. 1st Rabi‘ Thani 1344 (19th October, 1925). I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the Government of Nejd are still of opinion that it is necessary to examine the possibility of extraditing criminals, in the hope of ensuring peace on the frontier and of preventing all disturbers of the peace effectively. My insistence in this matter is due to the particular experience I have, and to my knowledge of desert conditions. My first object is to prevent any rivalry or friction from arising between the two Govern34- ments, and in this I am actuated by three main motives:— («) religion and honour, which com pel us to act truthfully and in keeping with our pledges; (£») our special ties of friendship with His Majesty’s Government, which make it incumbent upon us to take a far-sighted view; (c) our desire to live in peace, quiet and amity with our neighbours the State of ’Iraq. 2. I am of opinion that the Agreement which you presented for discussion this morning, although it may achieve some of the purposes for which we strive, does yet leave the door open to a great number of troublesome incidents of a kind of which we have had cause to complain in the past. In particular, I have submit ted to you the following incidents as being of the kind which habitually occur in life in the desert:— (a) what should the attitude of the i Nejd Government be if an ’ Iraqi tribe, having committed a reprehensible crime involv ing killing and plunder, were to take refuge in Nejd; and what would the same Govern ment’s attitude be if that refugee tribe were to commit the same crime, notwithstand ing guarantees being taken from it; (Z&gt;) what should the attitude of each of the Governments of ’Iraq and of Nejd be if a Nejd tribe, having been punished by the Nejd Government for a raid into ’Iraq were to take refuge into ’Iraq and then to raid Nejd from ’ Iraq, as was done by those tribes who had taken refuge with Nejd and then gone over to ’Iraq, after the well-known incidents connec ted with Yusuf Sa'dun ? I beg that you will examine these questions carefully. After considerable experience, I see no effective way of cir cumventing the trouble other than that Nejd and ’Iraq should both admit the principle of the surrender of criminals, and that criminals, having perpetrated a crime in their country should be preven ted from seeking refuge into the other country. Measures based on any othe* principle would not in my opinion, shut the door on the dissensions of which we all complain; and I ask that this state-35 ment of mine should be put on record so that it may be referred to in the future,■ and so as to set my conscience at rest in case such incidents, of the kind which wc deplore and would prevent with all our efforts, were to recur. Usual respects. (Sealed) ‘ ABDU’L-'AZIZ IBN . ABDU’R-RAIIMAN IBN SA‘UI&gt;. Sir Gilbert Clayton, etc..

Bahra Camp, The 20th October, 1925. Yotjr Highness, I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Your Highness’ communica tion of 1st Rabi‘ Thani (19th October, 1925), and I note that Your Highness is of opinion that no agreement is likely to establish security on the frontier and put a stop to raiding which is not based on the principle that either Government at the request of the other Government should return, if necessary by force, any tribes or portions of tribes which may cross over into its teiritory, 2. As I have repeatedly informed Your Highness in our conversations, the ’Iraq Government is unable to subscribe tc this principle, which it deems contrary to Arab traditions and impracticable of execu tion. I have also informed Your High ness that His Majesty’s Government, after careful consideration of the facts and of the views put forward by Your Highness and on your behalf in the past, have reached the same conclusion, lhat being so, I regret that I am unable to adopt the principle which you recommend. 3. On the other hand, I would point out to Your Highness that the draft Agreement which I presented to you recently goes far towards meeting your own views in the matter, and that in drafting it I have endeavoured as far as possible to reconcile conflicting opinion. It is based on what, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, is just and fair to ’Iraq and Nejd and to the tribes con cerned ; and 1 feel sure that, provided it is loyally carried out, peace and stability36 on the border ought to prevail, and that any disputes arising from the aggressions of tribes, even in such complicated in stances as those mentioned by Your High ness, will be capable of settlement without real difficulty by the two Governments of y Iraq and Nejd acting in sincere co-opera tion. 4. With regard to Your Highness’ misgivings as to the efficacy of an agree ment such as I have proposed, I rely with full confidence on Your Highness’ re pented assurances of good-will and sincere desire for peace and order on the frontier.

Yotjk Highness, 1 have the honour to recall that in one of our recent conversations I spoke to Y our Highness about the necessity of settling the question of loot and losses resulting from past raids by tribes from ’ Iraq and Nejd, and we agreed that it would lie necessary to lay down general principles and formulate a procedure for the satis factory settlement of this question. 2 In accordance with our agreement, Taufiq Bey Suwaidi, the ’Iraq representa tive has' discussed the question with Sheikh Hafiz and Sheikh Yusuf, and they have come to a preliminary agreement on the subject. I have the honour, there fore, to request that Your Highness may, if you see fit, signify to me your concur rence in the following proposals fa) That the ‘Hqair Conference should be taken as the start ing point for reckoning the looses claimed respectively by 5 Iraq aod h ejd on account of the raids which have taken place between that Conference and the date of ratification by the ’Iraq Government of the Bahra Agreement. lb) That the tribunal provided for V f in Article 2 of the Bahra Agree m ent should be charged37 with the-task of enquiring into the claims of both sides and of assessing compensation due for the losses resulting from raids taking place during the abovementioned period, with out prejudice to the other duties which this tribunal will have to perform in the future. (c) That this tribunal should be as sembled and should meet within a period not exceeding six months from the date of the ratification of the Bahra Agreement by the Government of ’ Iraq in accordance with their constitutional laws.
