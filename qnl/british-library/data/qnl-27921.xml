Harding 1 s letter of 6th October 1936 and connected correspondence regarding broadcasts from United Kingdom in languages other than English. Uhole question has been under examination for some time past by Government here in consultation with British Broadcasting Corporation and views which you expressed received fullest consideration. Decision finally reached to accept principle of such broadcasts and short statement on subject made by Postmaster General on 29th October was followed by fuller statement by Chancellor of Exchequer in course of Debate on Address on 1st November. Summary of latter statement is contained in my code No.22a.. telegram 3SLo,«.lg4 and text follows by mail. No. 168 Broadcasuo are n'&lt; present coutenmlated only in onanist;. r ortagues© and Arabic and there ould of course be full consultation with Departments interested before extended the service to any other language. A,s regards Spanish and Portuguese number and length of broadcasts to South America in these languages by foreign countries has recently much increased, object being to create atmosphere which may later-be turned to political and commercial advantage. It was felt that United Kingdom could not allow her position in relation to South American countries to go by default and it is therefore proposed to begin with 15 minute news bulletinsin these languages which* which it is believed can be sent out between fifth and sixth transmissions of Empire service without impairing efficiency of latter* Extension of service depends on bringing into use of new transmitters. As regards Arabic, nature of activities of foreign stsftons and particularly Italian station at Bari have made it essential to ensure full presentation of British viev.' of events in Hear and Iliddle East and where necessary correction of misstatements. For this service separate transmitter will eventually be required. Emphasis has been laid throughout on importance of dissociation of foreign broadcasts from the Empire service and of ensuring that scope and future development of the latter im in no way impeded. B.B.C. who fully realise this have undertaken to take all possible steps to this end e*g c by use of wholly separate programme notices and where possible of separate transmitters. Further it is not contemplated that United Kingdom should enter into propaganda field; as Postmaster General stated on 29th October ’’When v;c send out news it will be straight news, as Hon. Members 'would wish, and not propaganda” . Above is primarily for your personal, information but certain very misleading Press reports have appeared here and if there are any misconceptions on part of Dominion Government particulars given may help you to dispel them.\ 4 (I 1 . /.. 1 ; 7377 I i 1957 .

H.H.G. are satisfied that same high standard will be maintained in new service as in existing services.

The Government have been considering for some time the ques tion of broadcasts in foreign languages. It is a delicate matter involving both questions of policy and problems of equip ment. We have been working at it for some time, and before the right hon. Gentleman who spoke first raised the sub- “ject, the Government had already decided to make broadcasts in foreign languages. I want to say, also, that when we send out news it will be straight news, as hon. Members would wish, and not propa ganda. x x ( Q&gt;t, 501 ) V. X X V «T Before I deal with the other part of the Amendment, there is a short statement which I have to make on another sub ject that was mentioned in the Debate, and which I would sooner make imme diately, because it may be difficult to find time to make it later on. It has to do with the statement made on Friday by my right hon. Friend the Postmaster- General, that the Government have had under review for some time the question of the British Broadcasting Corporation undertaking broadcasting in languages other than English. The House will re call that the Ullswater Committee on Broadcasting made a recommendation to the effect that the appropriate use of lan guages other than English should be en couraged; and inquiries which have since been made of His Majesty’s representa tives abroad have led to the conclusion that broadcasts from this country in Spanish and Portuguese would be wel comed, particularly by listeners in South American countries, and in Arabic by listeners in the Near East. What I want to make plain is that the British Broadcasting Corporation, fully realising the importance of the issues in volved, had already for some time been examining these problems, and they made it clear that, if the Government decided that action on the lines of the Ullswater Committee’s recommendation was desir able, the Corporation would undertake to provide a satisfactory service as speedily as circumstances would permit. The Government have now requested the Cor poration to take action in the matter, it being agreed that nothing should be done which would prejudice or interfere in any way with the existing Empire service at Daventry. New transmitters are needed, and until they are constructed and brought into use, only a limited service will be possible. Details concerning the introduction and scope of the service will be announced shortly by the Corpora tion. I should like to make it clear that, in this new service, the Corpora tion will have the same full responsibili ties and duties as are set forth in the Charter of the Corporation in relation to their existing services. His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that the Cor poration are to be relied upon to main tain in this new service the same high standard which is characteristic of their Home and their Empire services.

A iAl l 1 JtMt-Minute Paper. Department. Extract from Report of Cabinet Committee on Arabic Broadcasting (dated 22nd Oct. 1937). Conclusions: 'We recommend - (1) That Cyprus should not be adopted as a centre at which to erect a station for Arabic Broadcasting. (2) that the Cabinet should accept the principle of broadcast messages in foreign languages being sent out from this country. (3) that these broadcasts should be carried out by the British Broadcasting Corporation, who should in principle retain, in respect of them, the same independent position that they possess in regard to their present broadcast services, and should accept responsibility for the delivery of all matter sent out in connection v/ith broadcasts in foreign languages. (4) that, in practice, having regard to the special position of the Foreign Office in relation to broadcasts in a foreign language addressed to listeners in other countries, the Corporation should undertake to maintain close touch with that Department in all matters affecting such broadcasts - particularly those in Arabic - and to do their best to meet the Department^ views. This understanding should be incorporated in a 'gentleman^ agreement' , which might take the foim of an exchange of letters between the Director-General of the Corporation and the Permanent Under-3ecretary of the Foreign Office. (5) that the Corporation should take all possible steps to dissociate broadcasts in a foreign language from the Empire Service. ( 6 ) that a start should be made as early as possible with broadcasts from this country in Spanish and Portuguese, and, subject to the completion of arrangements for a new transmitter, in Arabic. (7) that no special payment should be made to the Corporation -from the Exchequer for broadcasts in a foreign language, but that any repre sentations for financial assistance by the Corporation should be submitted on the basis of the existing Agreement between the Postmaster- General and the B.B.C. (Cmd.5329), and should be considered by the Treasury and the Post Office on their merits. While the final settlement should be a matter for negotiation, it must be assumed that the greater part, if not the whole, of the cost of the new service will ultimately fall on the Exchequer. 6474b Wt 22530/P 114 10,000 0.37 lOP ( 8 )/( 8 ) that detailed arrangements for the new service should he worked out with the B.B.C. 'by the Departments concerned, viz.:- The Treasury, the Foreign Office, the Dominions Office, the India Office, the Colonial Office and the Post Office.MR. NORMAN said that the representatives of the B.B.C. were very glad to have an opportunity of meeting the Committee and considering ¥/ith them the question of 'broadcasts in foreign languages. This matter had 'been 'before their Board hut they had come to no definite con-’ elusion partly 5 perhaps “because they were at present Unaware of what exactly was in the mind of the Government, If the Government had in effect decided that broadcasts in foreign languages should be sent out,and that the B.B.C. should be responsible for a Home, Empire and Foreign Service, that was obviously a decision of the greatest importance, not only to the B.B.C. but also to the whole community. There was some division of opinion at Broadcasting House regarding the advisability of broad casts in foreign languages but there were certain aspects of the problem on which they were all agreed. In the first place, if the Government decided,for reasons of high policy, that foreign broadcasts v/ere desirable it seemed to them obvious that the same organisation v/hich at present undertook broadcasting to the home country and throughout the Empire should be charged with the task of undertaking a Foreign Service. They could not conceive that any other body but the B.B.C. could in this country carry out such a task. Secondly, if a Foreign Service were to be instituted it must be carried out very well. At present there was no competition between the B.B.C. and other countries in regard to broadcasts in foreign languages, but once a start was made, for example, by broadcasting to South America in Spanish and Portuguese, comparisons would be made between the B.B.C and the German Organisation. It would be fatal to copy Germany and doit badly. One or the reasons rut forward in support of broadcasting in foreign languages was the loss of prestige if the aractice was not adopted. Prestige would not be obtained by cutting up a feeble service which was inferior to that provided by Gomany. He felt, therefore, that although a start might be made on quite a small scale, g. t&gt;y 15-minute news bulletins in Spanish and Portuguese, the Service must grow until it became quite a. big thing. The Committee should realise that it would be expensive, both from the technical and from the programme points of view, to rrovido good programmes. Thirdly the institution of a Foreign Service must not in any /ay prejudice the Empire Service, and must not a-dvorsely interfere with ‘the oresent scope of that Service or with its future development. Fourthly, if the 3.B.C. provided the Foreign Service it, must remain as independent in respect of it as it nor was for the Home Service. This did not mean they would not main tail? touch with the Foreign Office. They already kept in touch with tin:t Depart lent on all matters in which it was interested. In the event of the establishment of a Foreign Service the points of contact with the Foreign On ice you Id be grea.tly increased. _.t the same time, the 3.3.G. could not become merely the organ of the Government for broadcasting to the world. In fact the charter and licence of the Corporation would only permit it to undertake the Service under consideration on the basis that it remained an independent organisation. On tnis aspect of the matter ho wondered what the Government really had in mind. Was it expected that the broadcasting, organisation would restrict itself to factual transmissions, or would they send out supporting programmes? Would they have to look' ’ 3 out for mis-statements in foreign broadcasts? At the present time he understood that Italian broadcasts in foreign languages were not regarded with as much credit as might have been expected,, If this country were to cease to ignore these broadcasts and to enter into competition in the foreign language field one effect might be that a lie sent out by another country would be taken to be correct by the world unless contradicted from this country and* consequently, that the credit of oroadcasts from other countries might be increased at any rate in respect of all statements which were not denied* Fifthly, he die not think that the home listener couid De expected to pay for a Foreign oer/ice.. The Treasury and the Post Office had recently examined tne linances of the B.B.C* and had concluded that the full amount of 75 per eent 0 of the revenue from wireless licences was essential to the B.B.C. for an adequate Home and Empire Programme* As regards the future they were already faced with the problem of securing finance for television development and he was sure that there would be nothing available out of the balance of the licence revenue for a Foreign Service c For this purpose the money must be found by the Government, GIR JGH2T KEITH, summarizing Mr, Norman’s remarks, said the Corporation was agreed:- (1) That there should be no prejudice to the Empire Service, (2) Th't, if foreign short wave broadcasting was to be done at all from this country, it.should be done by the B.B.C., and in this event if the B.B.C. were broad casting there might be trouble if the Foreign Office were broadcasting elsewhere, e,g, Cyprus, (3) It would require to be done on a considerable scale.(4) Special finance would 'be required. (5) The B.3.C. world have to have the same freedom vis~h~vis Government departments as with the home service. With regard to (l) the Empire Service was at present conducted on a comparatively small scale, and considerable development was essential. As regards (3) pepole would not listen to news bulletins only - surrounding programme features were required. As regards (5) the was already amenable to representations in respect of home and Empire bulletins* and v/ould appreciate the Foreign Office point of view with regard to bulletins in foreign languages. There were desirable and undesirable, effective and ineffective, methods of conducting propaganda. If this new service were undertaken* the Corporation could be relied upon to give full v/eight to Foreign Office views. This was a matter of such importance that he hoped the issue would not be determined on points (4) and (5); in other words, that any difficulties in regard to finance or B.B.C. independence should not lead to the estab -1 ishment % of a Foreign Office station in Cyprus. Arguments in favour of foreign language broadcasts were chiefly of the 'why not' order; English lethargy; the English language not understood; foreign inaccuracies uncontradicted; other countries were increasingly broad*- casting languages other than their own, and even inhabitants of Empire territory were affected; a good deal that was untrue and unfriendly was broadcast, but no doubt some of the propaganda was so crude that it defeated its own object; constant dripping, however, wears away a stone.Arguments against: prestige; that our hands would he soiled and present high reputation tarnished by adopting the practice of other countries; it was a credit to England that there were no broadcasts other than in English today; the discredit of other countries would be transferred to England, to the and even to the existing Empire Service (there had even been suspicions in the Dominions when the Empire Service started); finallj^,. it could not be undertaken as an experiment and then dropped. He personally was in favour of broadcasting in foreign languages, but he was concerned at the fact that the department of the 3.B.C. from which the greatest support might have been expected was strongly opposed to it. Mr# Graves, Controller of the Programme Division, who had inaugurated the Empire Service five years ago, was of this view. MR. GRAVES said that all his experience in regard to the Empire Service and the contacts which he had made convinced him that its success would be damaged and its improvement in future retarded if a policy of foreign language broadcasts was adopted. British prestige and its reputation for integrity partly arose from the fact that we were adopting a different policy and were not doing something which other countries were doing lavishly. If v/e changed our policy and copied those countries, there would be a great loss of faith in this country. Naturally, if it was decided to carry out foreign language broadcasts, the B.3.C. would implement the decision to the full extent of their ability.0 - 6 - SIR JOHN RNITIIj in reply to a question by the Chairman, said that ultimately for a foreign service, two additional transmitters would be required The capital cost would be of the order of £ 100,000 with about £ 100.000 per annum for maintenance, inclusive of engineering and programme costs, salaries, copyright etc. The maintenance costs of the Empire Service were at present £203,000 per annum. Fifteen minute Spanish and Portuguese ne'. r s bulletins could be provided with the existing plant, and without damage to the existing Enroirc Service These could probably be organised in about one month, or perhaps less. As regards future development, this depended on the soeed at /liich it was decided to expand. In the first year probably some £25,000 could be usefully spent, apart from capital. He thought they would organise an Overseas Service •hich would include both the Foreign and Empire Services, lie considered that the foreign news bulletins should be kept as close as uossible to those for the Empire Services. This did not mean that the bulletins to all zones would be identical. At oresent the E pire bulletins and the Home bulletins were quite distinct and, in the case of the former, about two-thirds consisted of nows of general interest to the Home and Empire, and one-third of nows of interest to the particular Empire zone concerned. /here for example, it r as desirable to contradict a false story regarding a particular part of the world, it would always be possible to do so in the appropriate ■rogra me THE CHAIRhA said he wondered whether the 3 .B.C. would be able to take ua sufficiently strong attitude in regard to matters in the broadcasts of other countries ./hich were prejudicial to our interest, and whether the criticism* - 7 - would not be made that the 3.B. C. did not deal with these controversial matters as vigorously as would be done from a Government station. SIR JOHN RHITII said that he was sure they would be criticised by the right for not doing enough and by the left for doing too much. He was sure that they could do the job adequately. He did not think there would be any difficulty in dealing with matters of fact. In any event, if the Foreign Office were not satisfied, and the B.B.C. could not see its way to take full responsibility for broadcasting in the particular terms that Department desired to have used, the message could always be sent out with the foreword n 7e are asked by the Foreign Office to ', though this practice was not to be commended. SIR NOEL ASHBRIDGE said that he was in favour of broadcasting in foreign languages. The existing station for the Empire Service had been built so that additions could be made to meet the requirements envisaged in a Foreign Service. There were no technical difficulties except in regard to the allocation of suitable wave-lengths and these would exist wherever these broadcasts were carried out. HR. LLEPLR recognised that Sir John Reith had gone a long way to meet the apprehensions of the Foreign Office. Their view was that Arabic broadcasts must be different in character from those in Spanish and Portuguese. The only requisite in the latter case was to broadcast a translation of the well-balanced bulletin of world news ordinarily put out daily by the B.B.C. The Spanish and Portuguesespeaking communities of South America were hi 0 hly sophiscated and 'westernised' peoples and, of an entirely different mentality and outlook from the Arabs. Hews broadcast to Arabs, therefore, would need special treat ment by a method of selection and omission - selection of such items of news as it was in the interest oi this country to broadcast to the widestpossible Arabic speaking audience, and the omission of newsv/hich, in the view o the Foreign Office it would be inadvisable should receive the emphasis that broadcasting by wireless would give. This was an innocent form of propaganda, but it was propaganda and as such was hardly suitable tor the B.'j.C. He thought that instances would often arise in practice where the Foreign Office would consider it essential to put across 'propaganda' of this nature which the B.B.C. qu'te properly from their own standpoint might view with considerable reluctance as inconsistent with the standards of impartiality and objectivity they have hitherto so consistently maintained. The Foreign Office felt that this differentiation in treatment was of cardinal importance, and that, acting in collaboration with the Colonial Office, they should be allowed the necessary latitude in hanuling and presenting material destined for the Near and Middle East. Moreover Arabic broadcasts were to be based only in part on news from London. Our various missions in uhe Near East had been instructed to send to the Press Ofucer at Jerusalem news items of local interest v/hich would interest the Arabs in neighbouring countries, and thus make the broadcasts more attractive. This could be donebeUer from the Near East than irom London.HR. HORMAH said that he recognised that Arabic broadcasts -/ere on rather a special footing. Personally ho saw no objection to propaganda broadcasts in Arabic being made from the stations under Government control in Jerusalem or Cyprus 5 whilst at the same time the B.B.C. from this country carried out broadcasts in foreign languages other than Arabic. SIR JOHN RSJITH said he thought it would be unfortunate if there .-ere two services going on simultaneously - one from this country under the B.B.C. and the other under the Foreign Office in some other country. It would be in fact more justifiable to broadcast .,rabic from Daventry than Spanish since Spanish is not a language used in the British Empire. He thought the special difficulties in regard to Arabic broadcasts could be solved. The B.B.C. might have to sho / more elasticity and porhans be more amenable to -Foreign Office views than in the case of other languages. The effect obtained by a news service carried out by the B.B.C. in any language would be based on tolling the truth. Prestige depended on truth ul and comprehensive broadcasts. People should feel that because they have heard a statement on the British wireless it was correct; and, conversely, that if it was not included in the British broadcasts it was incorrect. In reply to questions from Mr. Barlow, SIR J0H1T REITH said he was rather reluctant to regard Arabic S, sui generis 1 * although at the moment ho admitted it seemed to be the most urgent need. The problem created by Arabic broadcasts from Italy light arise in other parts of the world. The Germans, for example, had only recently taken up broadcasting in Spanish and Americahad now also instituted 'broadcasts in that language. If* the 3.B.G. was responsible for all broadcasting in foreign languages they would be able to meet these difficulties wherever and whenever they occurred. He though it would be difficult to provide a sustaining programme in Cyprus, and impossible to do so on a standard which would conform to the proper standards. Local resources must be extremely limited and any station there would, in fact, stand out in the Mediterranean as an ,f ad hoc ,f British Government propagandist station. Further, news bulletins involved collection, selection, editing and presentation of news* In addition there was the question of seeing that Cyprus or Jerusalem was properly staffed. It would be expensive and difficult to arrange for all this at Cjgpruso MR. BARLOW pointed out that it was not easy to make sure that propaganda was announced with the correct degree of intonation, sarcasm, passion, or d_etachment as the case might be. The Foreign Office could prepare the messages to be broadcast and send them out to Cyprus but it would be very difficult to control from Downing Street their delivery at Cyprus. If the B.B.C. was responsible for the foreign broadcasts, would they be able to give them the proper atmosphere? SIR JOHN REITH said that it must be assumed, that if the B.B.C. were asked to undertake the work and agreed to do so, they would brimg the same degree of expert management to bear as they had done in other fields. The problems of a Foreign Service might be more difficultthan those of the Empire Service but, just as they had to feel their way in the case of the latter, so they would in the former. They started with an advantage as compared with an organisation which had had no direct experience of or responsibility for broadcasting. They would, of course, be in constant touch with the Foreign Office and would seek their advice on staffing and other problems. In reply to a question by Mr. Barlow, MR. GRAVES said that it was essential that the News Service should be accompanied by a supporting programme. He thought that the practice of listening to news bulletins only was not nearly so prevalent in other parts of the world as it might be in this country. SIR NOEL ASHBRIDGE said that the German practice with Spanish broadcasts was to relay a musical programme with Spanish announcers for at least half-an-hour before the news bulletins in Spanish. MR. PHILLIPS 5 referring to the independent status of the B.B.C., said he thought that some distinction could be drawn between the foreign and domestic fields. Foreign news bulletins would not raise party political questions but might raise important questions concerning our relations with foreign countries. On this sort of subject the Foreign Office was surely the acknov/ledged authority as to what was in the best interests of this country. The essence of the matter was that the Foreign Office should get over the air exactly what they wanted, and they should be in a position to say what ought to be done and said - 4 in the best interests of the international relations of this country. MR. NORMAN said he did not anticipate any difficulty in v/orking out such an arrangement. The B.B.C. had very fewdifficulties with the Foreign Office at present in matters which concerned them and, if the agreement of matters arising out of 3 Foreign Service was as good as it was at preseno, the would he able to preserve its conception of an independent status without failing to satisfy the Foreign Office requirements. All they wanted to avoid was the Foreign Office expecting the B.3.0. to accept responsibility for and transmit without question every bulletin or notice that might emanate j.rom the Foreign Office. The B.E.0.should be allowed to carry out the news services in the way in which, from their own experience, they knew was most likely to prove effective. He thought the difficulty was largely a theoretical one which would not materialise in practice. MR. PHILLIPS suggested that development ox a Foreign Service should proceed gradually by stages. A start could bo made with Spanish and Portuguese bulletins with, later, an extension to another language. MR. NORMAN agreed. The intention of the ; ^ ? i- L undertook such a Service, was to proceed slowly feeling their way in the light of experience as they went along. In reply to a question from the Chairman, SIR fOEL ASKBRIDGE said that,subject to reasonable delivery of pl^nt fr the makers, it would he possible from the technical point of 4- i vito a roa n ly p'ood programme about 18 months view, to work np 10 a i after the word 'go'. ME. DIXON said that the Dominions Office were anxious that any steps that might be taken in regard to broadcasts in a foreign language should be, if possible, dissociated from the Emoire Service, first because the Dominions disliked the idea o e her1n &lt;r a service with foreign countries with its implication that more importance is attached by this country to foreign countries than to the Dominions, and secondly, because of tne risk that the Dominions would, no doubt quite wrongly, suspect the news in foreign languages to be propaganda and would extend ^eir suspicions to the Empire Service. He wondered if an amalgamation 1 within the B.B.C. of the organisation for Foreign r.nd Empire Services was essential. — 1c 3 MR. GPuvVSS said he thought there was some misconception. Broadcasts to the .umpire and to foi countries in foreign languages would take place simultaneously and would not necessarily Toe identical programmes. Even when they were receiving the same programme the Dominions would not Toe sharing &lt;-he seivice. SIR NOEL aSHBRIDGE pointed out that in communications which he received the Empire Service was never referred uo with that title, Tout as 'Daventry'. In reply to a question from Ur. Barlow SIR NOEL ASHBRIDGE said that the B.B.C. at present had three hi 0 h power transmitters and there was space in the Building for a fourth transmitter which it was anticipated, would he used for the development of the Empire Service. The Building was so designed that an addition could Be easily made to it to provide for four further transmitters and amongst these would Be the two transmitters for foreign language Broadcasts. Whether they would require two depended upon the detailed schedule of Broadcasts, But so far as they had at present examined the position it looked as if two would Be required. If a short-wave set were installed at Jerusalem it would Be possible to transfer it to Daventry and make use of it there. But under the proposals tentatively discussed with the B.B.C. it appeared that the power of the transmitter contemplated for Jerusalem was less than that which would Be required at Daventry. It was possible to add to 'che power of a transmitter after transfer But this was not altogether satisfactory and if there was any possibility of installing a transmitter at Jerusalem and then transferring it later to Daventry it would Be Better to draw up specifications for a transmitter having from the start the same power as that ultimately to Be used at Davenury.MR. C/iLDER said tViat the idee, of usi 113 Jerusalem was to save time, hut there would he no saving of time if it was decided to establish an Arabic broadcasting service from Daventry 0 lH . GR/f/SS, in answer to the Chairman, said that he wondered whether, as an alternative to instituting a policy of foreign language broadcasts, it would not be possible to achieve a good deal by an extension or an improvement of the British News Service abroad, first step might be to come to some financial arrangement with Reuters which would enable them to arrange that their News Service could be used by my broadcasting or press organisation in South jUnerica without any payment. THE CH. JRIi-N said he did not thini: that the Government would be likely to approve any proposals that involved placing money at the disposal of Reuters. Continuing the Chairman said that the Committee was much indebted to the representatives of the B.B.C. for their presence and greatly appreciated the valuable discussion which they had had. JsR. NOHMmJT. SIR .••’OHK KEITH, SIR 1I0EL ASHBRIBGE and ’•R. GRAVES then loft the meeting._7TrUl SUB-COMMITTLIl then resumed discussion of the question in the light of the observations of the B.B.C. representativc s. MR. L.'.3'-LR said that it aoneared that if the B.B.C. undertook the Arabic as 'fell as the other foreign language broadcasts they v/ere 'repared to fall in with the Foreign Office vie'^s. In s^ite of that ho still felt that difficulties would be bound to arise. Sir John Rcitn had indicated that the relations between the Foreign Office and the B.B.C. were unruffled. They light be so in regard to news although the Department had to be very careful not to wress their views too hard, but in the case of talks on foreign affairs the position was quite different. There v/as considerable difference of opinion on this and he still thought it would be better for the Arabic broadcasts to go out from Cyprus under the sole control of the British Government. THE CI11IRMAN pointed out that if Cyprus 'fere used the Foreign Office would have to face a number of formidable difficulties, particularly in regard to organisation, which it would be much harder to deal r ith at Cyprus than at Jerusalem where, at any rate, there was an existing organisation to build on. Supporting orogramies also presented a difficulty and any helm from the B.B.C. was likely to be limited to relays of the Empire Servic which was not wholly suitable for urabic sneaking people. MR. BO TER mentioned that the Colonial Office h^ad recently had a slightly unfortunate experience with the B.B.C. in connection with Empire news. They had broadcast an unduly alarmist version of a recent disturbance nnTanganyika based presumably on a Reuters message. They had not rung up the Colonial Office and checked the news before broadcasting it. MR. LDSPBR pointed out that the 3.B.C. had working arrangements with the wress news agencies. Very often the news provided by these agencies was highly inaccurate. In any case it was not possible to effect immediate consultation with the Foreign Office at all hours of the night. The 3.B.C. was always liable to trim up on news provided by the news agencies. MR. BARLOW thought the plan to establish a station at Cyprus was very far-fetched. .Such a station would be bound to be regarded as an outmost of Downing Street. The transmitter to be used for Arabic broadcasts was useless for local broadcasts and another would have to be added for this rurpose with the additional complication and expense of Greek and Turkish broadcasting. The station was not going to be confined to the dispassionate broadcasting of facts It was going to send out contentious, perhaps biased counter-propaganda, in a foreign language with foreign announcers It could not be directly subordinate to the Foreign Office but on3.y indirectly through the Cyprus Government and presumably the Colonial Office. A supporting programme would be very difficult to provide efficiently. With these conditions he thought that successful results would be extremely difficult. Even at Jerusalem there were very small hopes of getting a high efficiency and then onlyMR. PHILLIPS said that in his view London was far more suitable than Cyprus. At the former place Arabic broadcasts would be more in accordance with international regulations, as we undoubtedly had the right to speak from London in their cm language to the Arabic ssoaking ^copies in or associated with the Empire. On two joints the B.B.C. attitude seemed to him rather too rigid - those of finance and their independent status. He thought it was essential that the B.B.C. should undertake in regard to the Arabic broadcasts to comply with the views of the Foreign Office. If they felt the tone of the announcements desired by the Foreign Office was wron they could appeal to the Ministers or the Government. He thought the B.B.C. v/ould agree to this. Sir John Reith obviously wanted the B.B.C. to do the work. MR. CALDBR said that, so far as the Colonial Office was concerned, they v/ould like to sec a broadcasting station set up in Cyprus which would provide Greek and Turkish news bulletins and programmes, but they recognised that the decision on this matter would have to be taken on wider grounds. MR. DIXON said that the Dominions Office on the whole would have preferred that foreign language broadcasts should not have been sent out from this country as he felt they would be bound to raise suspicions on the part of Lmpire listeners that they were propaganda and that this suspicion would extend to Lmpiro Service. In so far as there was a danger of such suspicions ho thought.that this was likely to be greater in the case of Arabic broadcasts (whichM Would probably be regarded as a rejoinder to the Arabic broadcasts from Rome) than in the case of Spanish and Portuguese news bulletins. MR. BARLO 7 observed that the Arab speaking population in the British Empire was surely just as entitled to receive programmes from London in its o-vn language as Australians -17-KR. PHILLIPS suggested that the Dominions would he glad to have the Italian lies about this country contradicted LlR. DIXON said that all Dominions did not take the same viev/s on this kind of question. LORD DE LA WARR said he thought that very f ew people in South Africa, for example, would listen in to an Arab broadcast or take the trouble to find out where it was coming from. MR. WALTON said that, in his view, a broadcast from London would carry greater weight than from Cyprus and, if the B.B.C. would agree to be guided by the Foreign Office views in preparing their news bulletins and ^-ny talks on Foreign Affairs in Arabic, ho was in favour of their undertaking the work, MR. LEEPER said that, if the B.B.C. met the Foreign Office as regards the Arabic broadcasts and questions were asked in the House of Commons he assumed that the answer would be that the B.B.C. were responsible and independent and its activities were governed by its charter. LORD DE LA WARR said that he was very strongly in favour of issuing the Arabic broadcasts from this country. Summing up the discussion THE CHAIRMAN said that the view of the Sub-Committee appeared to be that London was the best centre provided adequate safeguards could bo obtained from the B.B.C. to ensure that full expression was given in the case of Arabic broadcasts to the views expressed by the Foreign Office. No formal agreement or undertaking was practicable but heA ' thought there ought to he no difficulty in securing a satisfactory 'gentleman's agreement' with the B.B.C. on this point. He undertook to see the Foreign Secretary and the Colonial Secretary with a view to obtaining their concurrence in this conclusion, and would then fix a date for the next meeting. THE COMMITTEE agreed with the view expressed by the Chairman. 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1. 3 4th October^ 1937.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy dated 6th October 1937.

The Committee accepted our i'iew that the oossibility of locating the station in ~ndia should be ruled out, on account of the practical and political difficulties, especially as regards the future. At a further meeting on 4th October Mr. Norman and Sir John Reith and other representatives of the B.B.C., including Mr. Graves, were consulted regarding the oossibility of utilising the B.B.C. for Arabic as well as Spanish broadcasts. Mr. Norman and Sir J. Reith were not opposed to this, and in the subsequent discussion in the Committee the general opinion was that this would be the best plan, provided that an understanding could be reached with the B.B.C. giving adequate safeguards to ensure that, notwithstanding their independent status, they would be guided by the F.O. in regard to the news bulletins to be disseminated in Arabic and any talks on foreign affairs in that language that might be included in the programmes. If adequate safeguards are arranged on this point, it will be preferable from our point of view that the Arabic broadcasts should come from this country rather than from Cyprus, as they would carry greater weight with the Arab world. This is the view also held by Sir T. Fowle. Moreover, the B.B.C. are obviously much better equipped for the business, 415b :5000 10/31 including/including the provision of supporting programmes, than a * ' v. Govt.-controlled station in Cyprus coiild be. • The- F.G « ' representative stated that he still thought Cyprus was to be preferred, on account of doubts as to the B.B.C. complying with F.O. requirements, but I gathered that they be fairly content if they feel satisfied as to the adequacy of the safeguarding understanding with the B.B.C. which is suggested. #Telegram from Viceroy dated 2nd October 1937. 112Q-S Private and personal. Correspondence ending with Industries and Labour Department telegram dated September 28th regarding Arabic broadcasting. 2. I am anxious that in considering this matter the political objections stressed in paragraph No.4 of departmental telegram dated August 20th should be care fully weighed. There is little doubt that provincial Governments will strongly oppose erection of a station of the kind contemplated in the areas under their control, even though the cost were fully or partially met by H.M.G* and we should be reluctant to afford them an opportunity, by raising this question, of embarking on a discussion of circumstances in which they can claim to be entrusted with functions under section 129 of the G.of I. Act. 3. The reactions of a future Federal Government to the erection of such a station in centrally administered areas are less easy to forecast, but probabilities are that a Federal Ministry, even though favourable to the idea, would find it difficult to resist pressure to stop broadcasts from India designed to influence contraversial Issues in a direction not acceptable to Arab feeling. 404 XTHE COMMITTEE had 'before them the following Papers:- Paper No. A.B.C.(37) 9 - oopies of telegrams exchanged between the India Office and the Government of India regarding the location in India of a short-wave station for broadcasting in Arabic. Paper No. A.B.C.(o7) 7 - Memorandum dated 24th September by the Lord Privy Seal raising certain points regarding the Italian station at Bari, and the possibility of a single station for broadcasts in Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese. Paper No. A.B.0.(37) 6 - Memorandum by Mr. Phillips (General Post Office) dated 20th September, reporting the results of his interview with the B.B.C. Paper No. A.B.0.(37) 8 - Memorandum dated 28th September by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in regard to the proposal to broadcast news bulletins in Spanish and Portuguese during certain intervals in the Empire Service. THE CHAIRMAN said that the Committee had now received information from India in regard to the possible construction there of a short-wave station. MR. NALTON said that the initial cost of a short-wave station in India would be some £130,000 and the recurrent cost £41,000 as compared with an initial cost of £90,000 at Cyprus and a recurrent expenditure of approximately the same as in India. Apart, however, from the question of cost Lord Zetland felt that on political grounds there were strong objections to locating in India a station for the purpose con templated. First, as regards finance, the Government of India would almost certainly make it a condition that the v&amp;iole cost should be borne by His Majesty’s Government and it would be extremely difficult for them to be over-ruled on this point. Secondly there was the gene x-al coup iteration that the Government of India was reluctant to co-operate in this scheme. In the absence of willing co-operation it was impossible to rely on the scheme being carried out - 1 -- 2 - satisfactorily. Thirdly, as regards the future, after Federation was set up Indian ministers would he responsible for the administration of the station. The Governor- General might have certain powers, by which he could control their action in regard to the station, but he could not use them constantly to force Indian ministers to broadcast Foreign Office bulletins to which they objected. Further, the India Office had been impressed by the view expressed at the previous meeting that the Arabs would not appreciate at its proper value a broadcast distributed from India. He had consulted the Political resident on the Persian Gulf, who was in close touch with a number of Arao States, and the latter had confirmed the view that, whereas the Arabs looked up to His Majesty’s Government, rightly or wrongly they looked down on India. They would be inclined to disparage broadcasts from India and to disbelieve their contents. THE GHAIHMAN said that, in view of the difficulties pointed out by the representative of the India Office, which he accepted he felt that India could be ruled out as a possible locality for the station for Arabic broadcasts. THE COMMITTEE agreed with this view. Continuing, TH3 CHAIRMAN said that he thought the needs would be met for the time being if it were decided to put up a short-wave station at Jerusalem as soon as possible, and at the same time to carry out a survey and prepare plans at Cyprus to meet the contingency of a removal from Jerusalem to Cyprus. MR. BARLOW thought the Committee needed further information be fore they could come to a decision. Apart from the general questionof t] were his ' part the nuiii:^ new was were ther at J* - 5 - of the propriety of broadcasting m foreign languages tnere were a miuber of points raised by the Lora Privy deal in his Paper to whi^h they had not yet had an answer, ana in particular the question whether, if the Government accepted the principle of broaucasting throughout the worla in a number of different languages, it shoula not oe done from some new station in this country, and if so, whether such a station was to be'run by the Government or by the B-d.O. rf there were any cnance of such a development in tire .rear future he felt there was nothing to be gained by installing a shoi t \.'a.ve tc.tion at Jerusalem now. ?H3 OHAIidvhJT saia that, if a station were established in this country, for aealing with Government ^i-opaganaa m^ny people would take the view that it should not be run by the which they desirea to preserve in a co-rpletoly indepenaent position. dxm BARLOG said that he did not see how it would oe possible for the dominions Office, Foreign Office, home Office or any Government Department to organise and provide an entertainment programue• THS CliAIid^JT agreed ana said that that was why he thought it would be »..iore difficult to establish a station ioi Arabic oiocid casts here as compared with, say, Jerusalem. it would not be satisfactory to expect propaganda to be undertaken oy the B.B.w. In reply to the Chairman, ME. B-AiLOL said that he aid not feel in a position, in the absence of further infomaation to make a definite propose,! for a station in this country. He would like to hear the views of the B.B.G. lie understood that opinion at the Headquarters or the Corporation was aiviued. All the h.B.e. hadsaid at present was that 'If the Government tells us to broad cast these Spanish and Portuguese news •bulletins wo are - +n f v He thought tho Committoo ought to hear p’pop&amp;roa to ao oO. - wha.t the corporation had to say in regard to both the Arabic, and the Spanish and Portuguese -broadcasts and tneir possible * . e*,', 'Vnoaosals could expansion.

Germanjr werealready sending out extremely good Spanish and Portuguese broadcasts and the Americans were also doing so. The British News Service 9 on the other hand ? was very bad and we were dependent on foreign agencies. Some positive step in this matter was long overdue. The B.B.C. representative in America was about to make a tour in South America and was being x )U t into touch with our Missions* and the Foreign Office were most anxious to see a start mode 3 as an exper iment 9 with these fifteen-minute news bulletins which could in no way be regarded as propaganda^ and would be treated by the B.B.C. exactly as they treated news bulletins in English. THE CHAIRMAN said that s if they could interview the B.B.C. representatives without undue delay 5 he thought it would be advantagous to do so. LORD DO LA WARR urged that a start should be made with the fifteen-minute Spanish and Portuguese bulletins and the installation of a short-wave set at Jerusalem which would allow time for the examination of the possibility of a larger scheme for Government broadcasts. MR. BARLOW suggested that as regards the Spanish and Portuguese news bulletins 9 the Committee should hear the views of representatives 0 -t the ii.B.C. on that matter and see 9 inter alia 9 how the project would fit in with the Dominion Office views. If the Committee then came to the conclusion that they were desirable it would be possible to make an immediate start. So far as Arabic broadcasting was concerned a start had already been made with medium-wave transmissions at Jerusalems from which no doubt useful experience would be obtained.He thought that the Committee were entitled to give proper consideration to the project for a short-wave set at Jerusalem. If it were decided that the proper course was to put up a new transmitter in this country the installation of a short-wave set at Jerusalem would involve a good deal of nugatory expenditure. LORD DE LA Y/ARR said the question was whether the sum involved was too much to pay for making an earlier start. MR. CALLER said that the Secretary of State for the Colonies would he unwilling to agree that Jerusalem should he used for the station unless it could he stated at the same time that it was a temporary measure pending the removal of the station to a specified locality elsewhere. THE CHAIRMAN said he thought the case would he met hy saying that Jerusalem was being used pending examination of where the permanent location should he. MR. PHILLIPS said that it would he quite practicable to transfer a transmitter from one station to another. In some cases it might not he sufficiently powerful in the new site hut additional panels could he added in such an event. If the scheme for a short-wave set for temporary use at Jerusalem was to proceed he thought the B.B.C. should see the specifications so as to make sure that, in the event of its being moved from Jerusalem to this country, it could he used here. MR. BARLOW said that he would raise no objection to consultation with the B.B.C. as regards speci fications. These would necessarily take some time to prepare, and in the meantime the Committee would have a chance to explore the larger question.On this, however, he would like tc have more definite figures as regards cost. The cost of the station in India, for example, appeared somewhat high in relation to other figures before the Committee. MR. PHILLIPS observed that the power of the station in India would be 100 k.w., whereas for Jerusalem the station would be 20 k. w. He thought the figures before the Committee were approximately correct. The B.B.C. had three transmitters at work now and were thinking of putting up a fourth. Its power would be 50 k.w., and the estimated cost £55,000. This was rather bigger than the anticipated power and cost of a transmitter at Jerusalem, but he thought that, if there was any chance of its being transferred to this country, it would be sound to draw up specifications which would fit in with the requirements of the B.B.C. if they had to make use of it later. THE CHAIRMAN said he thought that Mr. Brasher, the engineer for the Palestine Government, who was to be in this country until about the middle of October, silcull confer with the B.B.C. regarding the specifications of a short-wave set at Jerusalem on the basis that it might be subsequently transferred either to Cyprus or to this country At the same time Sir John Reith and representatives of the B.B.C. should be invited to meet the Committee within the next few days. (MR. PHILLIPS left the Committee at this point to tele phone it o the B B.C.and subsequently reported that Mr.Norman, Sir John Reith, Sir Noel AShbridge and Mr. Graves would be available on Monday, the 4th October, at 2.15 p.m.) - 7 -MR. 3ARL0W said that in the event of the B.B.C. being employed to oroacLcast in foreign languages, it was uiOst desirable that the conception of their completely independent status should be maintained. So far as the cost of such broadcasts was concerned, it was important that any financial adjustments should be made as part of the general financial arrangement between the Government and the Corporation, and that it should not be dealt with as a specific item, in which case it would, have to appear as an item of expendi ture in the Foreign Office Vote. He thought, therefore, that the Committee should not discuss with the B.B.C. representatives the question of financial arrangements but should proceed on the assumption that broadcasts in a foreign language would fomn part of the general activities of the B.B.C. THK COMHITTBB then proceeded to discuss the Note by the Lora Privy Beal (Paper No. A.B.C.(3?) 7). HR. LS3PSR read the Foreign Office comments on the points raised by the Lord Privy Beal. (These are being circulated separately as ^aper No. A.S.C.(37) 10). MR. CALV3RT, in reply to a question, said that it was practicable to use a single Arabic dialect which would be understood by the whole of the Arabic-speaking world - Arabia, 3gypt, Hedjaz, Iraq, Syria ana Palestine. MR. LEEPLk said that the Foreign Office had not dealt with the possibility of placing the station in Uganda as he thoughttiLlG oii(_'; 0 ' 0 g 1 ion foil moro v/ith.in ‘b/io spliopo of brio Colonial Off!co thr.n the Fcp-.i ni Office. HR. 0 J.D: R said that he thod^ht that. If neither Cyprus nor Duventry was regarded as a suitable u-i-toi uatia e to Jerusa..ein, another possibility was men, which was an Arab Protectorate under the direct administration of the Colonial Office-. i,IR. PHIL*] IPS obsorvm that ,whilst there might be no objections to Uganda on technical grounds its resources were very limited and he.thought it would prove very expensive to provide a big wireless service there. Loroover, the service would not carry enough prestige, ana listeners coula scarcely be expected to pay much attention to Uganda as a centre for distributing the latest world news. MR. LlBiPKR, referring to the case of Cyprus, said that a power station was being erected at -.thens by German contractors, though he understood it was to be operated by the Greek Government. Medium wave transmissions m Greek from Cyprus would not only cover the Island but would reach Greece, and he thought that it would be very valuable from a British point of view if the Groups received news and other bulletins in Greek from some other sm.tion well as from that established in Greece itself. MR. PhlLLIfG pointed out that it would . . -i.„ ^,-l .v, - ! -i oV) near Greece and Turkey r ther provocative to ee... u .dii^ h a* - o station which would sond out hroadc :sts in the Inngur^oBof those countries, with the obviousIn view of the heavy expenditure involved no one was likely to believe a statement that they were primarily intended for domestic consumption in Cyprus* THIi CHAIRMAN was still inclined to the view that for Arabic broadcasts a start ought to be made with a short-wave set at Jerusalem and that a survey should be made and plans prepared for the establishment oi a station at Cyprus. The Secretary of State for the Colonies would be in a position to say that further examination was being made as to where the station was ultimately going to go. He recognised that this might not be entirely acceptable to the Colonial Secretary, but it might be the best compromise that could be achieved. MR. PHILLIPS said that his personal view was that ultimately London would prove to be the centre from which Government broadcasts should be sent out. The value of such broadcasts would be immensely increased by the prestige attached to their emission from London. More over, if the Italian attacks were being made from Rome, the corresponding centre from which to issue replies would naturally be London. He could not conceive anybody except the B.B.C» undertaking broadcasting from thin country, and he felt sure that no Parliamentary Committee would support any other procedure. At the same time he thought the B.B.C. would be sufficiently amenable to the views of the Foreign Office to incorporate the Departmental requirements in their own news bulletins, particularly if they were directed to straightforward corrections of inaccurate statements broadcast by other countries. It might bo practicable for the BcB u C, to take certain me a it uros which would tend to dissocie. u a these xo reign language news bulletins from their ordinary programmes and from the Empire Service-11 MR. LEEPER said that the Foreign Office did not wish to press for any broadcasts in foreign languages except in Spanish and Portuguese to South /jnerica, and in Arabic to the Near East. He emphasised again the distinction between the two cases. In the former case the news bulletins concerned would n-'t be in any way controvers ial, and could not possibly involve the B.3.C. in any difficultieso in the latter case this country was being attacked and lies were being broadcast about our activities. It was essential that thece should be dealt with. Although the Foregn Office had not the least intention of indulging in blatant propaganda of a virulent or offensive type and were fully seized with the advantages of the restrained and sober corrective statements and of the more subtle forms of counter-propaganda, it was inevitable that the messages for the Arabic broadcasts might from time to time have a controversial aspect- It was for this reason that the Foreign Office did not wish to ask the B.B.G. to undertake responsibility for broadcasting them. They would be bound to regard with some uneasiness any statement that might, at any time, be a subject of controversy. Putting across the proper answer would be far simpler, more satisfactory and more expeditious if the machinery for doing so was under Government control, CONCLUSIONS. THE COMMITTEE agreed*- (a) To recommend that, having regard to the cost and political difficulties anticipated, if a station were set up in India for broadcasting in Arabic news and other messages prepared by the Foreign Office, a station for this purpose should not be established in that country.I(b) To ask the representatives of the Secretary of State for the Colonies to arrange for Mr. Brasher, Chief Engineer, Government of Palestine, to confer with the B.B.C. regarding the specification of a short-wave transmitter suitable for erection in the first instance at Jerusalem for broad casts in Arabic, bearing in mind the possi bility of its transfer at a later date for use for the same purpose at Cyprus or in this country. (c) To meet representatives of the B.B.C. at 2c15 p.m* at the Ministry of Health on Monday, the 4th October, to ascertain their views as to the broadcasting in foreign languages' from stations in this country.h~ : k/i l [it* knnK.

I have read the memoranda circulated to the Committee and the Minutes of the first meeting of the Committee, held on the 15th September, when the representative-oJT-the Dominions -- Office reserved the attitude of the Department in reg^.id to conclusion (V) concerning the - immediate institution of daily broadcasts by the B.B.C. of news bulletins in Spanish and Portuguese. I feel that, in the circumstances, it is desirable that I should acquaint the Committee at once with considerations which, in my view, it is important to bear m mind, having regard to the prestige which the Empire Service enjoys in the Dominions and the undoubted value which it has as the most direct means of providing our fellow British subjects overseas with a picture of the political, social and cultural life of this country. It is indeed a very valuable instrument for maintaining regular contact and unity between different parts of the Empire, and is likely to become increasingly important. The proposals for broadcasts by the B.B.C. in Spanish and Portuguese for South America are made on the ground that there is an urgent political need for such services, and if the Committee generally are satisfied that this need in fact exists, it is only proper that every eans of meeting it should be explored.It is however important in my opinion that any method which is employed should be such us would not involve the curtailment, or hamner the future expansion, of the Umpire oervice„ the existing scope of which is barely adequate to attain the objects which are its aim, I understand that the present proposals would involve the use of the Emoire transmitters during two short intervals only • r hen they are not employed in the Empire Service, but on the other hand they would apparently reduce by the two periods in question the extent to which the Empire Service could be expanded in future. Further, once such transmissions arc initiated., it is probable that there will be demands for their expansion; indeed, it appears doubtful whether two short news transmissions of the nature proposed could be rega.rded as more than a beginning. It would be undesirable that any such expansion should be effected at the expense of the Empire Service. There is also to be considered the wider question of the effect which such broadcasts would have upon the refutation of the Empire Service as a whole. At present the Service enjoys great prestige, because it anpears devoid of any suggestion of 'propaganda'. The Dominions would be quick to resent propaganda as such; and there is just a danger that if the B.B.C. should embark on foreign broadcasts suspicions would be aroused that this was the prime object of the whole Service. I make this point not in an attempt to defeat the 'oroposal for foreign broadcasts, but only to urge that the position in this respect also should be carefully safeguarded. If the case for foreign broadcasts is established, I hope that they will as far as possible be dissocia-ted from the Empire Service and, furtner, that tney will, as I understand is the intention in the case of the short broadcasts at present proposed, consistmmrnmmm of a wholly impartial presentation of news., free from any donper of being regarded as direct or counter-propaganda. liven so, the position would, I feel, reruire constant and careful watching from the point of view of its effect on the Empire Service.

COMMITTEE ON ARABIC BROADCASTING. Comments By the Foreign Office on Note ~by the Lord Privy Seal. (Paper No. A.B.C.(37) 7). Paragraph 2. it ; * r understood Umt Bari Broadcasts on a medium-wave in several foreign languages including AraDic. The latter alone concerns the Foreign Office. The station has an effective range of about 300 miles in the daytime and several times that radius after dark. It would seem that the Bari news Bulletin in Arabic is relayed from Rome (2R0 4, which is a short-v/ave station) so that 5 whereas Bari is unable itself to give an effective service to the remoter countries of the Near and Middle East ? the news programme relayed from Rome is able to reach satisfactorily every part of the Arabic-speaking world, It is, however, not known beyond all doubt v/hether Bari is in fact relayed by Rome, but it appears to be highly probable. The Foreign Office have made enquiries on this point from His Majesty’s Embassy at Rome and have been informed in reply that they are unable to state categorically that these two Arabic programmes are in reality one and the same and they are unable to ascertain the facts without a direct reference to the Italian authorities themselves. The Foreign Office, therefore has proceeded on the assumption that the news bulletin in \ Arabic broadcast from Bari is in fact relayed from Rome. The programme, as given in a publication issued by the Italian broadcasting authorities in regard to their Rome station, consists of half-an-hour or twenty minutes and comprises both-2- news (journal Parl6) and Arabic music. The latter appears to consist for the most part of gramophone records by way of experiment. A member of the News Department of the Foreign Office listened in on the night of the 27th September, together with the person selected to listen as a regular thing to the Rome broadcasts in Arabic (Mr. S. Hillelson). As receivers were needed for other and normal duties, it was not possible for them to listen for the full half hour. The news was mainly concerned with the visit of Signor Mussolini to Germany and the recent accident at Alexandria involving the death of a score or so of Egyptians. Before the news, an announcement was made in Arabic to the effect that there would be a special broadcast at 8.45 p.m. on the following night, so there is reason to suppose that special talks are also given occasionally although they may not appear in the printed programme. The Arabic used on this occasion was of an excellent type. In the past the Arabic used from Bari and Rome has been open to criticism as being pedantic and classical in style and it excited the ridicule of listeners. It was then thought that the announcer was probably a Libyan or a Tripolitainian and that he was possibly a cleric. Last night the improvement in the quality of the Arabic was very marked and it was of a kind much more acceptable to the Arabic-speaking world generally than was previously the case. The announcer might have been a Syrian but was more probably an educated Egyptian or Palestinian. The type of Arabic to bo used in broadcasting admittedly presents certain difficulties, but these are not considered to be insuperable and have been carefully borne in mind in connection with the present scheme for strengthening the broadcasting of Arabic from Jerusalem. Under that scheme, which was inaugurated on the 17th September, it was agreed thatthe hroadcasting from Jerusalem should continue, as at present, to use the Palestinian 'Nahwy', as being fairly generally acceptable in neighbouring Arab countries, and at the same time it was decided that British Missions and Consulates in these neighbouring countries should be asked to listen to Jerusalem for a period of about one month and then furnish the authorities responsible there with constructive comments on the style, pronunciation etc., in order that a type of Arabic may gradually be evolved which would be palatable to the largest Arabic speaking audience. Paragraph 5. The strength of the Bari medium-wave station appears in the publications as 20 kilov/atts and that of the Pome short-wave station as 50 kilowatts. A tabular statement is attached showing the reception of the stations Bari, Jerusalem and Cairo- on the medium wave, in certain countries of the Near and Middle East. Paragraph 4. Arabic Dialects. It is true that in different parts of the Arabic-speaking world there are different varieties of Arabic and, though this fact is one of importance, it does not, in the view of the Foreign Office present insurmountable difficulties. The measures decided upon in the case of broadcasting from Jerusalem should ensure that Arabic broadcast from that station will be intelligible in all surrounding countries, in all of which the Arabic used is intelligible in the others. There would be no need for more than one announcer, for Arabic, Syrian and Egyptian dialects are mutually intelligible as are all the dialects” of Iraq., Aden, Hedjaz and the Sudan. This question has been borne very carefully in mind and the Foreign Office has had the benefit of the advice of the Oriental Secretariat in the Embassy at Cairo.Paragraph 6. The Foreign Office do not appreciate exactly the suggestion in this paragraph, unless it refers to the Daventry scheme. As far as Arabic is concerned, the Arabic-speaking elements in East Africa are not in the opinion of the Foreign Office of great importance and it is considered that they would be adequately served by a short-wave transmitter from either Jerusalem or Cyprus. Paragraph 9. The proposed broadcasting of Arabic from Jerusalem or Cyprus envisages an all-round programme of good entertainment value as an attraction in itself as well as a background to a reliable news service. This would appear to be a great improvement on anything that has been done hitherto from Italy. The proposed establishment of a medium- wave transmitter of 50 kilowatts and a short-wave transmitter of 20 kilowatts in the Near East should afford as good a reception as could be desired and certainly as good as that from Italy.

The G. of I. have now replied to the supplementary enquiries as to the technical possibilities of short-wave transmission from India as distinct from j the medium-wave transmission which the F.O. had originally said would be necessary. vs The attached table shows a rough comparison of the technical and financial aspects of the requirements , Tor transmission from (1) Cyprus, (2) India and ^ /t (5) Palestine, which it is in any case only proposed to *.J Ul -— , ttihicX lL&lt;A ' / Ui it ' , Ac ase ad interim . &lt; tv A U+sCit putifiSZ /fc /6$.? v tcZk ft*/. %rt As regards the political and other objections set out in paras. 3 and 4 of the G. of I.'s telegram of 20th August, some of these are less weighty than others. (a) There does not seem to be anything in their reference to the International Convention. (b) There does not seem to be very much, save as suggested below, in their reference to the present policy of not using the All-India Radio for purposes of tflCc HcU fa &amp; 47&lt;J5 5000 5.86 political propaganda, since this policy refers to questions of internal political controversy, not to efforts to explain H.M.G.'s policy to foreign countries. On the particular question of Palestine, however, it is of course true that strong objection might be taken in India to the propagation of H.M.G.'s defence of their policy, as the policy that may be decided on, however reasonable, is not likely to commend itself completely to Indian Moslems. But this is only one particular subject. The objective of the plans for Arabic broadcasting has no t • special reference to this subject, but is to enable us to counter false Italian propaganda in the Middle East generally. (c)/■A (c) As Arabic is not an Indian language, there would be no cover for the transmission of Arabic broadcasts from India, i.e., it would be obvious that they were transmitted for ’s purposes and not for any distinctively Indian purposes. (d) Broadcasting plans in India contemplate setting up small-power stations in the provinces to enable the latter to initiate a policy of rural development, ihis see an important consideration, because a station with the high ms power required for the Arabic broadcasts would not fit in with these plans and would obviously be wasteful, xhis bears on the question of the financial incidence, if transmission from India should be decided on - a question which has been reserved by the Chairman of the Committee for later consideration. It is certain,. I should think, that the G. of I., if they were persuaded to set up a transmitting station in India, wauld claim that the whole of the initial and recurring cost should be borne by H.M.G. Another point,not mentioned in the h. of I.’s telegram, hut which was mentioned at the meeting by Mr. Calvert, an officer with experience of Jedda, and which is confirmed by Sir T. Fowle, is that (apart from the difficulties of providing a suitable Arabic programme frorm India) 'The Indian atmosphere is not palatable to large j sections of the Arabian people, and the mere fact that thej broadcasting came from India would in some cases prejudice its usefulness”. A further point is that it is generally recognised as desirable that the station and its operation should be under H.M.G.'s control. This, to say the least, would be much more difficult in India, under federation, than in Cyprus. It would be difficult for the G.G. to use his authority in regard to external relations so as to decide/@ Minute Paper. Department. decide positively everything that should be broadcast abroad from an Indian station. The best way of overcoming this particular objection (if it should be decided to pursue the idea of an Indian station) might be to set up the station in an Indian State by agreement with the Ruler, but this might not be practicable. Moreover, whatever may be thought of the degree of validity attaching to the G. of I.’s various objections, it seems clear that ihM.G. could not, without their willing consent, make a success of broadcasting from India. It is submitted that at te-day I s meeting further attention might be drawn to the above practical difficulties about a station in India as compared with one in Cyprus.I (THIS DOCtJMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT. ) SECRET.

Note by the Lord Privy Seal. 1. There are certain matters which I feel ought to be considered before the Committee reaches any final con clusions on this question^ and I draw attention to them in this paper. 2. My first question is: What does Bari broadcast? What are we up against? Do they confine themselves to bulletins of biassed news ? or is the poison subtly sand wiched ’’etween attractive programmes of music 9 variety and informative talks? If the latter is the case 9 where do they get their talent? What language do they broad cast in? As regards Arabic 9 how do they overcome the difficulty of dialects? Do they confine their broad casting to the dialects of Libya, which 3 after all, they have a very good reason for using? 3. Then I should like some information about the technical equipment of Bari. How does its strength compare with our proposed 50 kilowatts? I see that the Foreign Office (A.B.C.(3?)4 para.6) considers that good news drives out bad, though when I think of the circulation of our sensational press, I doubt it: I feel much more certain that good reception drives out bad. Unless our station can be heard at least as easily as Bari, we shall waste our money.-2- 4. I should like to be informed of the views of &amp; competent Arabic linguist on the dialect question. I have a feeling that we may be underrating the difficulties when we talk of starting a station with just one Arabic announcer. Are the Egyptian and Syrian dialects mutually intelligible? Do not Iraq 9 Aden 9 the Hejaz 9 the Sudan and the North African Littoral each have a dialect of their own? 5. I am not sure about making the Director of the station responsible to the Government of Cyprus. Cyprus has its own political difficulties with Turks and Greeks 5 and principally vith the latter; but it has no Arabs. If the Cyprus Government has control 9 it may tend to use the propaganda to reduce its troubles t ith the Greeks 9 and the Arabic broadcasts., which should be the main things will be a by-product. Would it not be practicable for the Director of the station to be responsible direct to some authority in this country? He will be working for His Majesty's Government^ paid by His Majesty’s Government and I should have thought he would be best controlled by His Majesty’s Government without an intermediary. 6. The question of broadcasting in Last Africa in native languages is under consideration. I think we ought to give thought to whether it could not be combined with the Arabic and South American proposals in one scheme. It is part of the sane general problem - getting the British point of view across the air and not allowing foreign pro paganda to go uncorrected. While in the Mediterranean we are following at a distance 9 in East Africa we can forestall the broadcasts v/hich we may expect from Abyssinia. If and when broadcasting from Abyssinia does begin 9 it is going to toueh 9 in East Africa 9 a popula tion far less sophisticated and discriminating than that of the Middle East.7. What I have in mind when I mention the possibility of combining the Mediterranean^ South America and East Africa in one scheme arises from conversations I have had on the subject of reception of British broadcasts in East Africa. I believe they are better now 3 but up to a few weeks ago it was the general opinion in East Africa that reception from the German station was far better than from the British. I understand that the greater success of the German station was attributable to the employment of a directional system* whereby all its power went into a narrow sector of a circle. The B.3.C. had to diffuse their power more widely in order to reach the whole Empire I should like to be informed of the views of the technical experts on the question of whether diffusion from Cyprus through 560 degrees would be better than directional broadcasting from England or from East Africa. 8. Consideration has been given to the possibility of locating the station for Arabic broadcasts in India. It seems cl.ear that* sooner or later* an adequate broad casting station will have to be set up in East Africa* and it might a ell be that Uganda T.’ould be selected for its location. I should like to be informed of the views of the technicians as to the suitability of Uganda for Arabic broadcasts. Uganda is as near to Cairo as India. Moreover* if Uganda should be found to be the most con venient centre for the Middle East and East Africa* it would ha _r e the incidental advantage of being nearer than England to Buenos Aires and Rio. 9. The one thing I am sure about is* that unless the reception from our station is as good as the reception from Bari* the show is not worth doing.

General Post Office. I CALLED at Broadcasting House on the 16th September and discussed with Mr. R. C. Norman (Chairman) and Sir John Reith (Director-General) the pro posal that two 15-minutes news bulletins—one in Spanish and the other in Portuguese—should be broadcast daily from the Empire Station. I informed them that the Cabinet Committee had given full consideration to the objections, from a purely broadcasting point of view, to the introduction of foreign language broadcasts; but the development of the practice by most other important countries could not be disregarded; and the Committee had come to the conclusion that, on general and political grounds, it was desirable to proceed with the scheme described above. Such a service, if established, would naturally be somewhat experimental in character; and the question of the broadcasting of more extensive programmes, when adequate transmitter facilities were available, would be considered at a later stage. I had been asked by the Committee to inform them of the position and to ask whether, in the event of the Cabinet endorsing the Committee’s recommendations, the Government could count on the co-operation of the B.B.C. in carrying out the scheme. Sir John Reith seemed disposed to make a grievance of the fact that the B.B.C. had not been represented on the Cabinet Committee. I informed him that the views already expressed by the B.B.C., both in memoranda and at the meetings held during the last few months at Broadcasting House with representatives of the Government Departments concerned, had been fully considered by the Com mittee. If, however, the B.B.C. would wish to send representatives to discuss the matter with the Committee at their next meeting, I was sure the Committee would welcome the arrangement; or, alternatively, if they would prefer to submit a full memorandum recapitulating the Corporation’s views, the Committee would be glad to consider it. Sir John Reith did not seem to favour either of these courses. I gathered during the discussion that there was some difference of opinion on the subject between the Governors themselves and also between the principal officers of the Corporation, but that the preponderating opinion was unfavourable to foreign language broadcasts. Sir John Reith asked whether the Corporation would be recouped for the cost of the proposed broadcasts. I said that this was a matter for the Treasury, and that I had had no instructions on the subject either from that Department or from the Committee. I pointed out that the amount involved in carrying out the present scheme was very small; if, however, a larger scheme should subsequently be proposed, involving substantial expense which the Corporation could not find out of their normal revenue, it would, I imagined, be open to them to make a claim for some increase. Sir John Reith promised to send an early reply after other Governors had been consulted. A letter, of which a copy is attached as Annex I, has now been received expressing some misgivings, but stating that, subject to certain remarks [15870]on policy and finance, “ the Corporation is prepared, il requested by the Govern ment, to institute Spanish and Portuguese bulletins.” The paragraph near the end of the letter referring to finance goes beyond the view which I expressed very tentatively at the meeting and will require considera tion. I have thought it advisable, in my letter of acknowledgment (copy attached as Annex II), to repeat the statement that this is a matter for the Treasury, and that I have had no instructions on the subject. (Initialled) F. W. P. September 20, 1937. ANNEX I. The British Broadcasting Corporation, Broadcasting House, London, W. 1, September 17, 1937. F. W. Phillips, Esq., C.M.G., Director of Telecommunications, Post Office, E.C. 1. Dear Mr. Phillips, YOU informed us yesterday of the recommendations which a Cabinet Committee is making on the subject of short-wave foreign language broadcasts, and enquired whether, in the event of Cabinet endorsement, the Corporation would be prepared to co-operate in their execution by the immediate provision of fifteen-minute news bulletins in Spanish and Portuguese for the South American zone. We understand that we are not required to give our views on the principle of foreign language broadcasts—in regard to the wisdom and efficacy of which we have, in fact, considerable misgivings. But apart from this, we should certainly be reluctant to do anything which, from any cause, would now or later prejudice the Empire service proper. We are sure that the Government realises the importance of this service, and agrees that it must shortly be expanded and improved. At present it is just possible that such bulletins might be broadcast without prejudice to existing transmissions, but it might w^ell be that before long we should regret that the periods were so occupied. Further, although the bulletins are presumably in the nature of an experiment, it is pretty certain that their introduction will lead to a demand for a fuller service to the Spanish and Portuguese communities in South America. In this connexion, we are already faced with the desirability—if not more—of ordering a fourth transmitter for the Empire, so that it will be appreciated that an extension of foreign language activity can hardly be undertaken without the provision of a fifth specially for the purpose. There is another immediate consideration. We feel it would be unsatisfactory simply to broadcast fifteen-minute news bulletins in Spanish and Portuguese, and leave it at that; but that with a view to attracting listeners to them, it would be necessary to issue and secure a wide distribution of the Empire programme pamphlet in those languages, and probably also to arrange a certain number of other programme features before and after the bulletins, suitable for reception in South America and announced in Spanish and Portuguese as well as in English. It will be seen, therefore, that there is much more involved than the mere compilation of bulletins, their translation and transmission. It is understood that the Committee have not given consideration to the financial issues involved. These at the moment are not serious, although they are much greater than can have been anticipated. We shall not ask for a separate f rant now, believing that we can rely later, when consideration is given to uture policy, on such an arrangement as will take care of expenditure already incurred. Subject to the foregoing, the Corporation is prepared, if requested by the Government, to institute Spanish and Portuguese bulletins. We should be glad to be kept closely in touch with further discussions, and are, of course, ready to put our experience and views at the disposal of the Government and to give every assistance in our power. Yours sincerely, J. C. W. REITH.ANNEX II. G.P.O. Headquarters, St. Martin*s-le-Grand, London, E.C. 1, Dear Sir John Reith, September 20, 1937.

(37) 4 - Memorandum dated 13th September by the Foreign Office submitting a proposal that news bulletins in Spanish and Portuguese should be broadcast by the B.B.C. for the benefit of Latin America. THE CHAIRMAN said that the Committee had been appointed to consider certain details regarding the construction of a station to transmit broadcasts in Arabic. As regards the site of the station, it had been suggested that it should be in India, but he understood the Government of India were against such a proposal and had advised that it would be impracticable. MR. WALTON said that it had originally been contemplated that transmission would have to be by medium wave. The technical difficulties of operating such a station in India to provide the service required were extremely great, and the cost of such a station would amount to about £150,000, which was much in excess of the alternative at Cyprus* The revised scheme provided for a short-wave station. This possibility had not yetbeen taicen up \&lt;ith the G-overnniont of India. As regards the political objections the use of an Indian station for the purpose contemplated might lay the Indian Government open to the suspicion that they were circulating propaganda on behalf of the British Government which was of little concern to India e Alternatively difficulties might arise owing to the nature of the propaganda. If, for example* the station in India broadcasted viev/s in connection with policy in Palestine, it might give offence to Indian Loslems. However reasonably and correctly such views might be presented they might fall far short of satisfying Indian Moslems, who would resent the use of what they would regard as their own station for the dissemination of propaganda with which they did not agree. Moreover Arabic was not a language used m any pert of India, and it would be, on the fac€* of it, unnatural for an Indian station to broadcast in such a language. Finally, the plan of a high-powered station did not work in with the general scheme for broadcasting developments m India, which aimed at reaching the rural areas through a number of relatively small-powered stations situated in the provinces. Whilst he personally was not very strongly impressed by these objections, the India Office had to be gaided by the views expressed by the Government of India. MR. PHILLIPS said that from the technical point of view he did not think a short-wave station in India would interfere with the general Indian scheme of broadcasting, although it would, of course, beout of line uith.'the other stations as it would he of higher power and designed for a much longer range* _HE ClUIRivlAN said he would like the Government of India to he asked whether it was technically possible to fulfil the requirements by the construction of a short wave station in India, and if so what would he the estimated cost. SIR . ahhi xAiiiiuR Ci-JXiG/iN said that the Foreign office v/ere primarily concerned with securing effective action v/ithout delay to counter the stream of Italian propaganda. Subject, as far as was possible, to their technical requirements being met and freedom from political difficulties they had no strong views as to where the station should be. He pointed out, however, that, if broadcasts were to be given in Greek and Turkish, he thought there would be considerably more difficulty in organising ohem and the accompanying programmes in India than in Cyprus, and that the cost of cabling out the news bulletins, which would be prepared at home, would be greater to India than to Cyprus. MR. WaRUER thought that they would have a much freer hand at a station solely under British control than they would in India, where they would have go consider the effect on Indian opinion of messages sent from an Indian station. SIR CECIL BOTTOMLEY, in answer to the Chairman, explained that if the station was at Gypruo its cont^oi. would come under the Governor of Cyprus, and through him to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.MR. BOWER said that there were Government broadcasting stations in several colonies? e.g. Hong Kong, Ceylon and Palestine. The staffs of the stations were Government employees? and the programmes were drawn up locally under the control of a Broadcasting Committee. These Committees were probably not interfered with as a rule by the Governor? but there was power to control them if necessary. No difficulties should arise in supplying news services for a Cyprus station from home; in fact action of this kind was about to be taken in the case of the Palestine station? where information particularly appropriate for Arab peoples was to be collected and supplied by the Foreign Office. MR. BARLOW observed that the proposed station would scarcely be on the same footing as the existing stations. In their cases the home Government did not provide the whole cost and say exactly what news was to be transmitted. If this station were constructed at Cyprus? he did not suppose we should be prepared to leave it to the Director and Governor of Cyprus to decide what was to be broadcast. The details of the cost of the station would have to be set out in the Foreign Office or Colonial Office Votes and would be liable to criticism in the House of Commons. If the station were in India? the Government of India would be responsible? and any parliamentary questions concerning the station would be dealt with in the same way as other questions concerning matters within the responsibility of the Government of India. As regards the scheme generally, he was not quite clear what was aimed at. Originally he understood that the object was to disseminate propaganda over the Hear andMiddle East which would counter the Italian propaganda being sent out from Bari. In this event rigid control was obviously necessary, and he thought it would be advisable for this to be effected direct by the i*oreign Office or Colonial Office. If the proposal was not counter-propaganda but merely the dissemination of truthful news, the objections to the use of the Palestine station ceased to apply, and there appeared to be no reason why use should not be made of the existing organisation at Jerusalem operating under the control of the Palestine Government. oIR AIujaAKDER CADOGAN said that there had been no change in their general object, which 7/as to provide effective propaganda by broadcasting correct news. They were proposing to use Jerusalem in the immediate future as far as it was practicable to do so, but they were uncertain of the exact future status of Palestine and they thought it would be better to have this station on undisputed British territory where it could be adequately and properly run. . BAKLCi'/ thought that it would prove extremely difficult in practice to control from this co-ontry the way in which news v/ould be given out at a station in Cyprus. Experience had shown that criticism of the B.B.C’s methods was no ^ infrequent, although the controlling authorities were on the spot. Control over a station at Cyprus, particularly in view of the fact that messages 7 /ould have to be translated into a foreign language, would be very difficult, and the risk of offending a highly susceptible country like Italy would be substantial.- 6 - THE CHAIRMAN agreed that some risks 7/ere inevitable, hut the alternative to taking them v/as to leave alone a wide field for activities prejudicial to our interests and to do nothing. MR. Bi'vRLOv/ said he thought the risks would he less at Jerusalem, where direct supervision could he given hy the Palestine Government, than at Cyprus, where the control would have to come from the British Government. THE CHAIRMAN agreed that risks would he less at Jerusalem, hut, although it appeared possible to use that station for xhe time being, some alternative provision might have to he made for the future... MR. 'VARNER said that from a political point of view we should he hampered by operating from a station in a mandated territory. At Cyprus, for example, the British Government would he in a position, if they wished to do so, to say something which might he unpalatable to another country and face the consequences, hut at Jerusalem they would have to he continually hearing in mind the restrictions arising out of the mandatory position. SIR CECIL BOTTOMLEY observed that it would he difficult for the Palestine Government to send out messages which were frankly propaganda. MR. PHILLIPS said that, apart from the political aspects which he recognised might prove an overriding consideration, . from a purely broadcasting point of view there were greater objections to a station at Cyprus than at Jerusalem. It would he nopo provocative, in view of international regulations and conventions, toestablish, in a remote island a high-powered station (both medium wave and short wave) to transmit messages in four languages obviously destined for foreign countries. One such regulation was to the effect that, in principle, no more power should be used at a station than was necessary for broadcasting over its ov/n territory; and another resolution adoirted was to the effect that it was improper to broadcast in a foreign language if it gave rise to complaints from the country of which that was the normal language. These regulations had been broken by many countries. We had on more than one occasion protested against breaches of these regulations, but we now contemplated doing something of the same kind ourselves. On the other hand, broadcasting in Arabic from Jerusalem was perfectly legitimate and was in fact being done at the present time. It might be rather difficult to justify the use of a short-wave transmitter for such a small country, but there were precedents in Iraq and elsewhere for such a station. He suggested that use should be made of the Jerusalem station until it was found no longer practicable to do so, and that, in the meantime, the survey and plans for a station at Cyprus should be drawn up but no steins taken to construct the station. THE CHAIRMAN thought there was a good deal of substance in the objections raised by the Post Office to placing the station in Cyprus. SIR CECIL BOTJOMLEY observed that on this basis two stations might be required, one at Cyprus for Greek and Turkish broadcasts and another at Jerusalem j.or Araoic and Hebrev/.- 8 - MR. PHILLIPS said he had gathered from the papers that the main need was for broadcasts in Arabic and that Greek and Turkish were of much less importance. SIR ALEXAI'IDER CADOGAH pointed out that there was a very large Greek-speaking population in Egypt. MR. BARLOW said that if there was to be a new station ? India seemed to the Treasury to have some advantages over Cyprus. They had imagined that the difficulties would be largely tecimical and thought that, if they could be surmounted, its construction there might help India and satisfy the Foreign Office. MR. WALTON said that the Secretary of State for India was impressed by the case for the introduction of Arabic broadcasts as early as possible. He was fully satisfied that they were needed and according to his information they would in fact be welcomed by many Arab communities. He would therefore regret any long delay in starting this service. It would take two years to erect a medium- wave station in India, and he understood that it could be done considerably quicker in Cyprus. Moreover, while the Government of India’s objections on political grounds were perhaps rather narrow, it should be remembered that probably in a few years there would be a semi-autonomous central Government in India, under which any station such as that contemplated would come, and the British Government would not be in the same firm position in relation to the station as it would be if it were erected in Cyprus. MR. BARLOW agreed that the future of India required careful consideration, but if it was only proposed to disseminate facts he did not think the Government of India would be likely to object, and he thought there would be advantages in putting a short-wave set in that country.HR. BOWYER pointed out that if the capital cost of the station was to De provided 'by the home Excheauer it might be more prudent to spend the money in a Colony rather than in India, where control over it was likely to be much less substantial. hix. CALVERT thought there would be considerable difiiculties in providing a suitable Arabic programme from India, it would be possible to import Arabs, speaking the type of Arabic used in Palestine, for reading broadcast messages, but the Indian atmosphere generally was not palatable to large sections of the Arabian people, and the mere fact that the broadcasting came from India would in some cases prejudice its usefulness. Though it might be difficult to devise an attractive supporting programme in Cyprus, it would be still more so in India. SIR ALEXANDER CADOGAN enquired whether, if a short wave transmitting set were installed at Jerusalem, it would be practicable to transfer it later to India if it was decided to set up a station there. HR. PHILLIPS said this raised technical consideration but he was inclined to think that it might not be sufficiently powerful, although it could no doubt be enlarged, on transfer, and its power increased. MR. WARNER said that if a short-wave set was established at Jerusalem it would be as well, in view of . the political uncertainties, not to contemplate its retention there as a permanent arrangement.LORD DS LA WARR suggested an alternative scheme. If it hecame necessary to provide in this country an extra transmitting set for broadcasting Spanish and Portuguese messages to South America - and he did not think they would remain satisfied long with the initial proposals for a 15-minute message only - would it not be possible to use this set for transmission to the Rear and Middle East? He thought such a scheme would provide better programmes and easier control. It did not involve eliminating the jjlan for using the existing medium-wave set in Palestine. If a station were erected for Arabic broadcasting in Cyprus ? Palestine or India, the proposals in regard to South America would have to be considered as a separate scheme. On the other hand if the Arabic broadcasting could be carried out from this country the schemes for Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese broadcasts could be dealt with as a whole. MR. PHILLIPS said that this would be practicable from a technical point of view. In facu, mie b.b.C. had been considering broadcasting in Arabic. They had, however, been looking at it from the point of view of news. Arranging for a supporting programme might be rather difficult, although the Italians achieved it at B'-ri, and, having regard to the si so and resources of London, he thought the B.B.C. should be able to do so els' if such a schcnc were adoptedo The cost of a new transmitter and of a supporting programme up to BAB.C, standards v/ould be substantial e In reply to a question ho stated that if it was to be done from this country it would have to bo done by the B*B#C» and it would haraly be possible to create any other organisation. -10--11- MR. BOWYER said that ho understood the cost of a 50 kw. S/*V transmitter would amount to £55,000, and this v/ould he able tc cover the Near East and South America. MR. BARLOW pointed out that it would he a new departure to pay the B.B.C. to send out political broadcasts. At present the Corporation had an independent status, hut under the proposals before the Committee they would, during certain periods, he saying what the Government told them to say. MR 0 PHILLIPS agreed but lx Ahu ’ght that under any scheme sh uld f-'r foreign language broadcasting the B«BoC;&gt;/continue to work as independently as possible and should merely hoop In touch with the News Department f the Foreign Office in regard to any special items which that Department was anxious to have broadcast 0 MR. MACHTIG so.id that the Secretary of State for the Dominions was relieved, by proposals to erect a stafion in Cyprus, Palestine or India, of his anxiety that the broad casting of political propaganda might be associated, even indirectly, with the Empire News Service. If it were proposed to send out from the station conducting the Empire Service a series of broadcasts in foreign languages to foreign countries Empire listeners night assume that they were of a propaganda nature and there would be a grave rish, rightly or wrongly, that they would lose confidence in the Empire News Service and think that it too was of a propaganda nature. This would be a most unfortunate result, and his Secretary of State was apprehensive of anything that might impair the value of the Empire News Service. Ko had not had an opportunity of consulting him on the proposal to send out Spanish and Portuguese messages from the Empire Station and he must reserve, for the time being, the attitude of the Dominions Office on this point.ol'R ALEXANDER CADOGAM said that the Empire Broadcasting Service had presumably justified itself hy the balanced and reasonable nature of the messages broadcast and he would have hoped that Empire listeners would have assumed that the same standard which governed the messages to the Empire would gO'/ern messages sent out in a foreign language. iii ter some discussion as to whether the Government should set out their requirements and submit them to the B.B.C. before ascertaining the views of the Governing Body of the Corporation in regard to broadcasting news bulletins to South .america in Bpanish an&lt; ^ Portuguesej or whether the Government should be aware of the views of the B.B.C# when considering proposals, TiIE CHaIRMaN said that, when putting the question to the Cabinet, he would like to be able to tell them of the views of 0 hG Corporation. He thought the Post Office would be able to obtain these views without difficulty# NR. BARLOW, in reply to a question by the Chairman, said that the Treasury had not yet given serious consideration to a proposal for Arabic broadcasting from this country. It would certainly meet the point of control on the spot but there might be difficult questions of principle to be settled wi th the B. B. G. HR. /aRNER said that it was desirable in broadcasting to the Middle cast to make the subject matter definite, though truthful, pro-British propaganda. The B.B.C. might think this was overstepping the borderline. LORD DE LA 1VARR raised the question of the necessity of broadcasts for East Africa 0SIR CECIL BCTTOMLEY thought that this was scarcely necessary at present. It was probable that the local station at Nairobi would grow and that anything that was required could be carried out from that station. LORD DE LA WARR said that the Nairobi station would have to be very different from what it now is if anything was to be made of it. HR. BARLOW asked whether, if a short-wave set were erected at Jerusalem and it was subsequently decided to adopt a scheme in this country for dealing with the Arabic broadcasts as well as those to South America, the expenditure on the Jerusalem•set would be nugatory. MR. PHILLIPS said this question raised technical points but he thought that it would be possible to move the set from Jerusalem and use it elsewhere. SIR CECIL BOTTGMLEY mentioned that the estimated maintenance cost of a short-wave station at Jerusalem was £3,500 per annum. LORD DE LA Y/ARR emphasised the necessity for ensuring that the station was sufficiently powerful. During his visits to Africa he had been immensely impressed by the superiority in the reception of German as compared with the British broadcasts. THE CHAIRMAN said that he was strongly in favour of making a start at an early date, and he, therefore, thought that he should make an interim report to the Cabinet recommending the use as soon as possible of a short-wave station for Arabic broadcasts, and the transmission of 15-minute messages in Spanish and Portuguese to South America as proposed by the Foreign Office. The question of whether a short-wave set should be set up in Cyprus, -id-lnaia or Possibly at homo, in connection with an extension of the initial scheme for South America, could he settled as soon as tho farther information from India was forthcoming.

The F. O. memorandum of 13th September, however, states that subsequent enquiries show that short-wave transmission would meet the needs of a sufficient number of listeners, and also that, even from Cyprus, some of the areas concerned could only be served by short-wave transmission. At the meeting on loth September the difficulties about an Indian station described in the I.Q. memo, and m the G. of I.’s telegram were discussed. As regards the political objections as stated by the G. of I., it was not felt that there was very much force in these. In any case, Sir Kingsley Wood was anxious to have information as to the technical possibilities in India on the revised basis of short -wave transmission. I agreed that we would send a further telegram to India, with/V with particular reference to the four points in the telegram below, which has now been sent. In the coarse of the discussion I said that the t Secretary of State agrees with the F.O. as to the urgency of the question of finding means for broadcasting in Arabic, and that the time factor might prove to be a consideration in favour of Cyprus, or some other scheme, rather than India. In the discussion of the relative merits of Palestine and Cyprus great importance was attached by the meeting to having the station in a territory which would remain under H.M.G.’s jurisdiction/. I therefore suggested that forthcoming constitutional changes in India might also affect this consideration^rendering- it more difficult for H.M.G. to exercise complete control over the utilisation of a station in India for broadcasting British news and views. Sir Kingsley Wood thought that there was some force in this. t • • The main conclusion of the meeting was that the interim proposal as regards Palestine, including the interim use there of a short-wave transmitter, should be submitted/submitted to the Cabinet, and that the most suitable ultimate location of the station should be further considered on receipt of the G. of I.'s reply to our telegram. Lord de la \7arr suggested that one alternative right be transmission from this country by an extension of the proposal^made separately by the F.O.j to ask the B.B.C. to provide a service in Spanish and Portuguese. The question of financial incidence (which would be relevant in connection with the G. of I.'s political objections m the event of the idea of an Indian station being pursued) was, Sir Kingsley Wood stated, reserved for later consideration. w— INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL t S.W* 1. 17th Septenber, 1937.

EXAMINATION of the recommendations in A.B.C. (37) 2 in the light of further information from the various countries in the Near East and in consultation with the departments concerned and the B.B.C. indicates that these recommendations require modification on one important point. Earlier information led to the belief that a 50-kw. medium-wave station in Cyprus would be both necessary and sufficient for the purpose in view on the oround (a) that a large number of potential listeners in the area to be served could receive only on medium wave, and {b) that medium-wave transmission from Cyprus would effectively reach the whole of that area. The result of subsequent enquiries is to show (a) that a far larger number of listeners than had een thought possess sets able to receive on both short and medium wave, and that the tendency will be more and more in this direction, and (b) that the areas moie remote from Cyprus (say more than 300 miles distant), namely, Iiaq, Persian Gulf, most of Arabia, Southern Egypt and the Sudan, would be effectively served only by short-wave transmissions. A short-wave transmitter in Cyprus would now seem to be essential. . . For technical reasons, however, short-wave transmissions from Cyprus could not be effectively received in the areas nearer Cyprus (say within 300 miles), namely Northern Egypt, Palestine, Syria and the Lebanon. Most of this area is of course, at present reached by the Palestine medium-wave broadcasting service, the Arabic broadcasts from which are about to be strengthened but the assumption is that this situation cannot continue indefinitely, and on this view it will be ultimately necessary to serve this area from elsewhere. lor this purpose a medium-wave transmitter would also be necessary in Cyprus. The above is concerned onlv with broadcasting in Arabic. Broadcasts in Greek and Turkish (to the Greek and Turkish-speaking peoples in the Eastern Mediterranean and the important Greek community in Egypt) and in English have, however, been envisaged as important secondary advantages of the scheme. Greece could not, it seems, be satisfactorily covered by a medium-wave transmission, which would be best for Turkey and Northern Egypt. The arguments in favour of two transmitters based on regional grounds are emphatically reinforced by technical advice (particularly in the light of Palestine experience) as to the desirability of using two transmitters where programmes have to be issued in more than one language owing to the shortness of the effective daily period. In the case of Cyprus four programmes in Arabic, Greek, Turkish and English are suggested. It is now considered, therefore, that both a medium-wave and a short-wave transmitter would be necessary in Cyprus. 9476 [15842]the wavelength used, be intended only for the use of the inhabitants ol the Mandated territory, may be open to criticism, but there is nothing in the terms of the Palestine Mandate to prevent it and there is the special justification (with which League of Nations opinion may, in present circumstances, be expected to sympathise) that the broadcasting of a full and accurate news service capable of ■fcxming the countries around Palestine, such as is proposed, has become essential in the interests of Palestine itself, which it is the duty of the Mandatory Power to safeguard, and especially in order to counteract the provocative messages (of which there is ample evidence) broadcast from outside the territory. The Mandate for Palestine imposes the duty of securing that no discrimination of any kind shall be made between the inhabitants of Palestine on the ground of race, religion or language.” It would, therefore, be necessary to balance improvements in the Arabic broadcasts by a corresponding improvement in the Hebrew service. As the material telegraphed from London will be avail able for use in Hebrew as well as Arabic bulletins, thus considerably improving both, there is not likely to be much complaint, so long as the same number of hours is allotted to Hebrew as to Arabic broadcasts. The Jews might well greet with enthusiasm the construction of a short-wave station which would enable Hebrew broadcasts from Zion to be heard, if not throughout the world, at least throughout a far wider area than at present. Conclusions. It seems clear that, if an effective presentation of British news and views by wireless covering the Near and Middle East is to be achieved, both short and medium-wave transmitters will be required at the proposed Cyprus station. I here would appear to be strong arguments in favour of using the short-wave trans mitter in Palestine pending the completion of the station in Cyprus. Foreign Office, September 13, 1937./!■■ U FOREIGN OFFICE S.v/.l SECRET 13th September 1937 Ivly dear Clauson, As a result of further examination of the details of the scheme for a Cyprus Broadcasting Station since the preparation of our Memorandum, Cabinet Paper ABC (37) 2 of the 29th July, we found it necessary to put up another paper for the Meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Wednesday next.

The capital cost of Installing the station on this basis is estimated at about £90,000, but it must be erphasized that this figure is necessarily a very rough a&gt; roximation and that accurate figures can only be obtained by inviting quotations from the manufacturers* The proposal to inetal a short wave transmitter in addition to a medium wave transmitter necessitates revision also of estimates of annual maintenance in respect of light, heat and power and engineering.

SOUTH AMERICA is at present the target of broadcasts in Spanish or Portuguese or both, from Germany, Italy, Russia. Japan. France. Holland and the United States. Since the Pan-American Congress of November 1936, the American broadcasting companies, in particular, have greatly strengthened their South American services, constructing new transmitters for the purpose and reorganizing their programmes. All these broadcasts are, of course, propaganda, that is to say, they aim at creating in the South American public, who are for the most part ignorant of any language but their own. a predisposition towards, and an admiration for, the countries from which they emanate, in the hope that the attitude of mind thus formed may sooner or later be turned to political and commercial account. In addition to the usual items of entertainment, the programmes contain direct political and commercial propaganda in the form of news bulletins which in their representation of world events and of internal events in the country from which the broadcast comes are designed to give the most favourable impression of that country’s policy and material progress. 2. The Foreign Office have for some time been concerned at the damage which British interests in South America are bound to suffer, if Great Britain’s foreign competitors for influence and trade are allowed to monopolise the air. Naturally, they have regarded the question chiefly from the political point of view, from which, as the attitude of the South American States at the time of the Abyssinian crisis clearly showed, it is serious enough to deserve attention; but no doubt from the commercial point of view the consequences of neglect may be equally dangerous. At the moment, the only British news service for the FTess reaching the greater part of South America is that of the British Official Wireless. Yet even if the position in this respect were better, it would not lessen the importance of the direct, immediate and authentic presentation of news which a broadcast news bulletin affords. 3. In these circumstances the Foreign Office have consulted the B.B.C. and His Majesty’s Representatives in the South and Central American countries with a view to establishing whether broadcasts in Spanish and Portuguese from Daventry would be acceptable and useful in Latin America; if so, whether it would be technically possible for the B.B.C. to fit such broadcasts into their existing system of services; and finally, whether, even if it were possible to arrange such broadcasts, there might not be reasons against our entering upon the field of open propaganda. 4. So far as the first and second of these questions were concerned, no insuperable objections were met. The replies from His Majesty’s Representatives were almost without exception favourable to the proposed broadcasts, particularly those from His Majesty’s Representatives in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru.

It is not sSstedlhat the'desirability of a fuller programme should iio^te exammed- indeed arrangements are being made for a representative of the KB.C., who shortly be visitimr South America, to discuss the points at issue with His Majesty ■ Renvesentatives there; what is suggested, however, is that since these discussions and the subsequent introduction, if necessary, of an extended programme must tike a considerable time, it would be better, in view of the urgency of the need, to carry out at once those limited measures which are known to be practicable, without prejudice to any later expansion of them. 5 411 that has been said so far rests on the assumption that the increasing number and length of broadcasts to South America in Spanish and Portuguese from countries outside that continent makes it desirable for this country to embark on similar and competitive, action, and that the only point which needs to be discussed is how this action can most effectively be taken. This assumption has, however been questioned in certain quarters and it will be necessary, if this step •’ to be ta ken to consider certain of its implications. So far as His Majesty s Government are concerned, the necessity of broadcasting m foreign languages has already been accepted in connexion with the proposed Arabic broadcasts to Near Fastern countries The present proposal, however, involves two new considera tions namelv broadcasting in foreign languages by the B.B.C. and its possible ™ ,tA Freni re Service. On both these points His Majesty s Government ♦ \ news service of this kind could be started on avowedly experimental lines, so that it could be expanded or at worst withdrawn later. The main necessity is to make an immediate start.3 will no doubt wish to receive the views of the Corporation : the main points in doubt have, however, already emerged in the discussions which have taken place between the Corporation and the interested Government Departments, and something may be briefly said of them here. ^ 6. The proposed broadcasts in Arabic (and possibly in Greek and Turkish T^so) will not be connected with the B.B.C.; nevertheless, the arguments in their favour have some bearing on the present case. It has been objected that broad casts in foreign languages automatically discredit those who employ them and that, in consequence, the only result of this new departure will be to cast doubt on the veracity of His Majesty’s Government or the B.B.C., whichever is responsible for the new broadcasts. To this argument there is a negative and a positive answer. The negative answer is that, since other countries are employing this medium, our only alternatives are to compete or to be left in the shade, since experience shows that, if we keep silence, the result is not that we are respected for our integrity and reserve, but that we are ignored in favour of those who take the trouble to express their views. The positive answer is that good news drives out bad. We must assume in the case of Spanish and Portuguese broadcasts, as we have in the case of Arabic broadcasts, that the news service which we provide will be impartial, authoritative and up to date, and that reasonable utterances of this kind will in the end be more listened to and believed than pronouncements which are obviously partial, and will be better understood than an ambiguous silence. It is of no use to argue that, because foreign propaganda will defeat its own aim by its excesses, there is no need for us to do anything. Even apart from the danger of leaving the field free to our competitors, relying only on the presumption that they will act foolishly, there is a positive need for us to state our own case, which no one is likely to do for us, even if they spoil their own. Nor is there necessarily anything degrading in using the most effective and most modern means of making ourselves understood; if the manner is restrained and the matter reliable, there is no reason why broadcasts of this kind should not provide an additional reason for respecting British methods as well as an additional channel for explaining British views. 7. The other main argument against these broadcasts is that their association with the Empire Service may prejudice the reputation of the latter among Empire listeners. The British High Commissioners in the Dominions were consulted when the desirability of foreign broadcasts was first discussed with the B.B.C., and, with the exception of the British High Commissioner in New Zealand, they expressed the view that any foreign language broadcasts should be kept apart from the Empire Service. It has already been shown that, if a news service only is broadcast, it will go out in one of the intervals between the Empire transmissions, and that, if a more extended programme is desired, a new transmitter may be needed. The foreign service will, therefore, be dissociated from the Empire Service as much as is practically possible. It may be said that in either case Empire listeners may pick up the broadcasts and may be disquieted at the emission from Daventry of what they will regard as propaganda. On the other hand, it would be a pity if an urgent political need could not be met merely on account of an illogical prejudice of this nature. It cannot be too much to hope that Empire listeners will continue to judge the B.B.C. on the merits of the service with which Daventry supplies them and will realise that we do not cease to speak truth when we speak in any language but our own. 8. Finally, the objection may be dealt with that to admit broadcasting in Spanish and Portuguese is to open the door to demands for broadcasts in innumerable other foreign languages as well. As to this, all that need be said here is, first, that, so far as the Foreign Office are concerned, no request of this kind will be put forward that has not an urgent political necessity behind it; and, secondly, that at present no further request is foreseen. It is possible that, although the British High Commissioners in the Dominions have at the moment rejected the idea of broadcasts to the Empire in languages other than English (e'.g., French and Afrikaans), requests for such broadcasts may be received when once it is known that such broadcasts are taking place to foreign countries. If this occurs, then presumably such broadcasts will have to be arranged within the Empire Service; in any case, the matter will be one for settlement between the Dominions Office and the B.B.C.4 9. To sum up, the following questions are submitted for decision : (a) whether any objection is seen in principle to the B.B.C. broadcasting in foreign languages. [In this connexion it may be recalled that among their conclusions the Ullswater Committee included a recommendation that “ In the interest of British prestige and influence in worlg^ affairs .... the appropriate use of languages other than Engh? should be encouraged.”] . ^ (b) whether, if there is no such objection of principle, His Majesty s Govern ment will be willing, in view of the present position as regards foreign broadcasts in South America, to recommend strongly to the B.B.C. the immediate introduction of a news service in Spanish and Portuguese to be followed, if necessary and if suitable arrangements can be made, by a more extended programme. Such a recommendation would, of course, be most seriously con sidered by the Board of Governors of the B.B.C., who would represent their views to His Majesty’s Government if they saw grave objection to its execution or wished to suggest amendments to it. In conclusion, a word may be said as to the financial aspect of this question. If the B.B.C. were to institute foreign language broadcasts as a result of a recom mendation from His Majesty’s Government based largely on political grounds, they would no doubt expect the extra expense in which they would be involved to be borne from Government funds. It is, of course, difficult to give an estimate of the cost of introducing Spanish and Portuguese broadcasts until the exact limits of the scheme are known, but on the assumption that it would at first consist only of news bulletins, it may be calculated, on the basis of figures supplied by the B.B.C., that the extra staff required (announcers, typists and their holiday reliefs) would cost in the neighbourhood of £2,000 per annum. In addition to this must be reckoned such further expenses as overhead charges, salary increments, and the cost of running the transmitters at Daventry for an additional period each day. A comprehensive estimate would, therefore, work out at between £2,000 and £3,000 a year. If a more elaborate programme were needed, and especially if such a programme required a new transmitter, the cost would, of course, be ^iy much more; but all it is desired to press for at the moment-—though this request is urgent—is the restricted service outlined above. An additional reason for action ini he immediate future is the necessity for establishing a claim to suitable wave lengths At present, while His Majesty’s Government are restricting their action in The international field to broadcasts in English, other countries who are broad- casting in a great number of foreign languages are acquiiing wave-lengths on which^to do so. If this process continues, it will very soon be difficult to obtain adequate wave-lengths for ourselves. It is therefore most desnable to take &lt;in earlv decision on this question of principle, and certainly in time for action to be taken at the Wave-length Conference which is due to meet in Cairo next February.

CONFIDENTIAL, Dear Walton, In connection with the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on the Ibth September regarding the project of using Cyprus for broadcasting in Arabic, I thinic, and Foreign Office agree, that it would be as well for you to have copies of the following correspondence:- (1) despatch to Cyprus of the 5th August. (2) the Cyprus reply of the 18th August. (3) the Cyprus despatch of the 9th April referred to in 2 and the circular despatch to which it was a reply. (4) the reply in respect of Palestine and Transjordan to a questionnaire by the Chief Engineer British Broadcasting Corporation on medium wave reception in the Near East. (This questionnaire was also sent to Aden but a reply from there has not yet been received). 1 am writing similarly to Waterfield (Treasury) Phillips (General Post Office) and Cliffe (British Broadcasting Corporation) and sending a copy to the Foreign Office.Palestine Broadcasting citation, and the occasional exercise of influence on the Egyptian broadcasting station at Cairo* Meanwhile, inquiry shows that the Italian broadcasts, even if they are not ta*cen at their face value, and occasionally even excite ridicule by their exaggerations, do, by their very persistence, end by creating, if not a feeling in favour of Italy, at least a prejudice against Great Britain* S. His Majesty’s Gove.nment have decided, therefore, that the time has come when it is essential to ensure the full and forcible presentation of the British view of events in a region of such vital Imperial importance, and with this object in view have approved of the adoption of the scheme described in the enclosed memorandum wnich has been prepared in the Foreign Office. The scheme is based on the principle that to reach the great mass of Arab listeners any broadcast must be delivered in Arabic and on a medium wave , since the wireless receiving sets which it is desired to reach are, for the most part, it is understood, medium wave seta which cannot receive direct short wave emissions. Bari is itself a medium wave station: and medium wave sets are cheaper and easier to work than the short wave sets which would be necessary for direct reception from the United Kingdom. The omy two medium wave stations in the Near and Middle Hast are Jerusalem and Cairo* As it would not be leasible to attempt to exert continuous influence over the Cairo station, it is proposed, as an immediate and interim measure, to make use of the Palestine Broadcasting stationao a Biedium for the presentation of British news to the Arabs in the manner proposed in the enclosed memorandum entitled ’’Broadcasting in Arabic”. 4. In one respect, however, this proposal represents an unsatisfactory compromise, Jerusalem is, and so far as can be seen is likely to remain, in Mandated Territory, and the continued use of the Palestine Station for this purpose might give rise to international difficulties. What is required, it is felt, is a medium wave station under British control, that is to say, on British territory, which, besides rebroadcasting the Daventry programmes, could give programmes of its own in English, Arabic, Greek or TurKish. The most suitable site geographically for such a station would undoubtedly be Cyprus, from which all parts of the Levant and the Near and Middle £ast could be easily reached. Prom the Imperial point of view, such a station should be of great use, not only in the Arabic speatcing countries, but in Cyprus itself and the neighbouring Greek speaking countries as well, including in the latter dgypt, with its large Greek population. It is worth mentioning in this connection that a large German built station is soon to be erected at Athens, and it may be desirable that this should not become an important centre of attraction for Cypriot listeners. 6. The construction of a station in Cyprus would avoid the criticism that might be incurred by the continued use for the service of British interests of a station in mandated territory. it would make available to a very much larger audience the present programmes of the British Broadcasting Corporation, including the broadcasts of great events**r f events in British notional life* It ought also to provide for the inhabitants of the various countries served by it programmes of local interest such as they at present can only receive, if at all f from sources indiflerent or opposed to British needs* 6* For the above reasons, His Majesty’s Government are at present examining the desirability of erecting such a station in Cyprus* A memorandum dealing with the scheme in some detail, which was drawn up by the Foreign Office as the result of a recent Interdepartmental Meeting, is enclosed. You will see that it would be proposed that practically the whole cost of the scheme should fall upon United Kingdom funds, and that the Government of Cyprus would not be expected to maKe any considerable contribution. 7* The scheme is at present in a preliminary stage; and its adoption has not been approved either in principle or detail. But it will be further considered by a Committee here early in September, and I have to request that you will endeavour to furnisG me early in that month with any observations or suggestions which you may vish to offer, both generally and in regard to such questions as staff, administrative and technical control and the programme materiel available locally* 1 have, etc., (igd.) w.

(55 Government House, Cyprus, IGth August, 1937 I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your becret i^espatch of the 6th August, 1937, regarding the proposed scheme for the establishment of a Wireless Broadcasting Station in Cyprus. 2. 1 need hardly sey that I welcome this proposal, and this Governiiient will be ready to do all in its power to assist in bringing the proposal to fruition as expeditiously as possible. At the present stage there are very few suggestions that 1 am able to offer; and, as far as I am in a position to form opinions of any value upon them, the various views and conclusions recorded in your despatch and its enclosures commend thensdves unreservedly to my agreement. 3. With reference to the last sentence of paragraph 4 of your despatch, it will in my opinion, as I have elsewhere informed you, be a matter of paramount concern to those responsible for controlling the development of the political situation in Cyprus that the Broadcasting station which is to be erected in Athene should not become an And clearly the only effective form of counter attraction would be a local Broadcasting station under British direction such as is now proposed. Palling the provision of such a n important centre of attraction for Cypriot listeners.broadcasts and - In “view of the deep rooted sympathies existing between Greece and Cyprus - with very serious results. 4. I agree with the statement at the end of paragraph 2 (Programmes) of the Foreign Office memorandum that it should be possible upon occasion to invite noted speakers and musicians to broadcast from Cyprus. A great variety of notabilities of different nationalities are now visiting Cyprus for appreciable periods end in increasing numbers, especially in the winter months. I suggest also that the opportunities for remuneration which a Broadcasting Station would provide are likely to attract both more and better professional talent into the Island. At present, apart from a few amateurs, most of the musical talent is restricted to professional dance bands. 5. There should be no difficulty in recruiting suitable Cypriots as announcers in Greek and Turkish, as well as for all routine duties in connection with Broadcasting; and rates of pay would by comparison with more highly developed countries be very moderate. 6. Cable and Wireless, Ltd., would doubtless be able to say to what extent and, at what rates of remuneration, local personnel would be available ior service as technicians. If authorized by you to do so I would cause the information to be obtained from the local manager of the company with such further particulars as might be desired. 7. On the question of cost (paragraph 4 of the memorandum) I would propose that, if a suitable site for a Broadcasting Station oan be found on Government xand, the land should be contributed by the Government free of charge. I am assuming that the site for the station would be at some considerable distance from any town. The local equivalentof Broadcaeting House would no doubt haye to be situated at Nicosia, the Headquarters of Go-yermiient. I would agree also to the contribution of a proportion of future revenue from local wireless licences. 8. I would ask to be informed in due course of the date on which the Chief Engineer of the Palestine Station may be expected to arrive in Cyprus and of any advance arrangements that may be desired in order to facilitate his survey. It would appear that it may be difficult to preserve secrecy in respect of the object of his visit when he comes here. 9. In conclusion I would invite reference to my despatch No.163 of the 9th .pril, 1937, and enclosure which contains a certain amount of information on the subject of Broadcasting possibilities in Cyprus and may conceivably be of some use in connection with the proposal to establish a Broadcasting Station in the Island.

Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Circular despatch of the 21st October, 1936, on the subject of broadcasting services in the Colonial Empire, and to transmit replies to the questionnaire which formed Appendix III to the Interim Report of the Committee on Broadcasting Services in the Colonies enclosed therein^ g 0 A report on the possibility of establishing a rediffusion service in Cyprus was prepared by Mr* Whitcroft, of Rediffusion Limited, and formed an enclosure in your despatcn No*465 of the 30th November, 1936^ The report concludes with the words: 'There would seem to be no doubt that the undertaking as a whole could not be seriously considered in any commercial form without certain safeguards and a full subsidy from Government.” Mr. Whitcroft does not state how much the Tull subsidy' would be, but I presume he means the difference between the receipts from 1,000 subscribers (an t The Right Honoui’able W.GoAoOrmsby Go^e ; P.C ?; H,?- ; Secretary of State for the Colonies. * Committee Paper No 0 32a(an optimistic estimate) at £3 per annum (which would he considered a high charge in Cyprus) and the operating costs of the service which he estimates at about £5,000. The subsidy would therefore he at least £2,000 per annum for a service which only reached four of the principal towns« For a rediffusion service to he of full value from the administrative point of view it would be necessary for it to reach the agricultural communities in the villages, hut to do that in a country like Cyprus v/ith a population density of 97 per square mile over an area of 3,572 square miles it is clear that the subsidy would have to be raised to a figure that would make the scheme impracticable 0 3o Rediffusion services might be introduced gradually, at Nicosia first, and then perhaps at one or two of the large tov/ns, but Government would not be justified in paying a substantial subsidy for such an enterprise, though it would probably be necessary to make an annual grant in return for which Government would have the right to use the service for official announcements or broadcasts of an educational character, and to exercise some control over the programmes offered to subscribers e 4c For a country with a low population density such as C 3 7 prus there is little doubt that a Y/ireless Broad casting Station would be the most suitable«&gt; Apart, however, from the high initial cost which the Colony could' not afford at present, there is the further difficulty that only few of the inhabitants of the scattered villages could afford to purchase receiving apparatus, and that even the provision\jq) provision communal i*eceiving set with amplifier to he installed in a central place in the village would he beyond the means of many villageso A Broadcasting Station would not he effective unless it were in touch with the majority of the population* To ensure this it would he necessary to furnish a number of receiving sets free of ©harge to the poorer communities, and make provision for their care and maintenance in places where no electric current or skilled assistance is available* 5 e You are aware that for a variety of reasons I , attach much importance to the provision of an efficient means of wireless broadcasting locally, and a report that a Broadcasting Station will shortly he in operation at Athens lends urgency to the obvious desirability of the Cyprus project from our point of view,, As, however, the available resources of the Colony are strained to provide works and services of an essential nature it would appear that, unless there is some prospect of financial aid from extraneous funds, it will not be possible to bring the question of erecting a Broadcasting Station in Cyprus within the sphere of practical consideration for many years 0 6„ With regard to paragraph 4 of your despatch under acknowledgment, there is no local expert who could usefully be sent to the United Kingdom to co-operate with the Broadcasting Services Committee and, in view of the con~ ' siderations set forth above, I doubt whether anything would be gained at this stage by the visit Id the Colony of a technical expert from the United Kingdom. 1 have, etCo, (Signed) H.

Doivning Street, 21*^ October, 1936. / have the honour to inform you that early this year my predecessor, the Right Honourable Mr. J. H. Thomas, appointed a. Committee “ to consider and recommend what steps coidd usefully be taken to accelerate the provision of broadcasting services in the Colonial Empire ; to co-ordinate such services with the organization of the British Broadcasting Corporation, and to make them a more effective instrument for promoting both local and Imperial interests. ' This Committee, under the chairmanship of the Earl of Plymouth and composed of representatives of the Colonial Office, the General Post Office and the British Broadcasting Corporation, as well as Sir }\ illiam Goivers {one of the Crown Agents for the Colonies) and Dr. \ aughan of the Advisory Committee on Education in the Colonies, have presented an interim report, a copy of which I enclose. 2. Successive Secretaries of State have urged the importance of securing as rapidly as is practicable the fullest development of broadcasting as a factor in the life of Colonial communities ; and it is hardly necessary for me again to emphasize a truth which has won general appreciation. The Committee, in accordance with their terms of reference, have directed themselves primarily to the question of ways and means of giving effect to this policy, but in so doing they have found it necessary to subject the aims behind the policy to a careful analysis which has resulted in the expression of a number of general principles with which I find myself in complete agreement. I commend these principles to your attention, and I hope it will not detract from the weight which / jeel should be given to all of them if I direct your special attention to the following statement in paragraph 14 o/ the report :— “ We envisage the development of Colonial broadcasting—and its justification not only as an instrument of entertainment for Europeans and others of similar The Officer Administering the Government ofeducation and means, who can for the most part listen in direct to Daventry and other stations on short-wave receiving sets, but also as an instrument of advanced administration, an instrument, not only and perhaps not even primarily, for the entertainment but rather for the enlightenment and education of the more backward sections of the population, and for their instruction m public health, agricidture, etc.'' 3. The Committee have dealt in some detail with the measures which may be possible in the Dependencies to secure the development of broadcasting m accordance with the principles enunciated, and I do not think that it is necessary for me to comment on this aspect of the report; it is sufficient to note that the composition of the Committee is such that on questions of this kind their recommendations, which it will be observed have been framed with careful regard to financial realities, must carry the utmost weight. 4. The Committee recognize that the determination of the precise measures to be taken in individual territories with a view to the establishment of suitable broadcasting systems may in some cases be a matter of considerable difficulty, and they make the helpful suggestion that a number of Colonial Governments may welcome specific recommendations in their own case based on the technical advice at the disposal of the Committee. In order to enable them to tnake recommendations in such cases they have drawn up a questionnaire which forms Appendix III to the report. It would, the report adds, “ be helpful also if each of these Governments would indicate whether it would find it possible to send one of its technical experts to this country to co-operate with the experts here in the determination of the jnost suitable broadcasting system or systems fo?' the territoy'y in question, or, alternatively, to p&gt;^y for the visit to that territory of a technical expert froyn here, if such an expert were available.' 5. I regard the above suggestions of the Committee as of great importance and I hope, therefore, that Colonial Governments will consider very carefully to what extent it may be possible for them to utilize the further advice of the Committee, and to submit proposals, including replies to the questionnaire, accordingly. I appreciate that in a few Dependencies ivhere broadcasting has already reached a comparatively advanced stage of development this course will not be necessary, a7id 1 would not wish in such cases to trouble either the Colonial Government with the preparation, or theCommittee with the consideration, of unnecessary material. In a number of Dependencies, however, no effective start has yet been made with the initiation of broadcasting systems capable of adaptation and extension along the lines indicated in the report, and in such cases it seems to me eminently desirable that the Colonial Governments concerned should take steps to avail themselves of the advice which the Committee are prepared to offer, and that to this end they should furnish the information indicated in the questionnaire, accompanied by such proposals as they are in a position to put forward. It is, of course, not to be expected that this information will in all cases be sufficient to enable the Committee to reach definite conclusions, and it is important therefore that the Colonial Government concerned should also indicate, as the Committee suggest, whether it would find it possible to send one of its technical experts to this country to co-operate with the Committee or, alternatively, to pay for the visit to the territory of a technical expert from here if available. 6 . I should add that, while I have not yet decided to publish the report in this country, there is no objection to the report and this despatch being given such local publicity as is considered desirable.

Ormsby Gore, M.P. r Secretary of State for the Colonies. I.—TERMS OF REFERENCE, ETC. 1. We were appointed by the Right Honourable J. H. Thomas r in February, “ to consider and recommend what steps could use- fu^^be taken to accelerate the provision of broadcasting services in the Colonial Empire, to co-ordinate such services wdth the work of the British Broadcasting Corporation, and to make them a more effective instrument for promoting both local and Imperial interests 2. Meetings have taken place on the 12th of March and the 27th May, and in between these dates there have been meetings of a Sub-Committee to consider various details in connection with our recommendations. 3. A list of definitions of certain terms used in this Report is annexed as Appendix I. II.—THE EMPIRE BROADCASTING SERVICE. 4 . At the outset w r e took note of the work already done by the British Broadcasting Corporation in developing the Empire short wave service from Daventry. Full information with regard to this has recently been sent to the dependencies. Briefly it may be said that the British Broadcasting Corporation have for some years been devoting considerable expenditure and attention to the development of this service both from the point of view of bringing the pro grammes as far as possible into line with the ascertained require ments of listeners and of increasing the power and adjusting the nature of the transmissions so as to secure good reception in all parts of the Empire : lor this latter purpose large capital expenditure on additional transmitters is at present being incurred. We were glad to learn that the objects which the British Broadcasting Cor poration have been pursuing in this matter have received the endorsement of the Broadcasting Committee appointed by the Postmaster General to consider the constitution, control and finance of the broadcasting service in this country (the Ullsw T ater Committee) wdio, in their published report (Cmd.. 5091), stated that they attached great importance to the maintenance and development of the Empire Service and recommended that it should be recognized as an important normal function of the broadcasting organization in this country, that it should be expressly authorized in the new charter of the British Broadcasting Corporation, and that the additional funds required for its development should be provided by the Corporation from the increased share of licence receipts which was also recommended by the Committee. 5. It is obviously essential that Colonial Governments for their part and at their end should take all practicable steps to encourage and promote the increased reception of the Empire service by those 37572 A 22 sections of the Colonial populations to which its contents are suit able. (It is appreciated, of course, that there must be large sections of the population in various dependencies to which a European pro gramme conducted in English can make little appeal.) The problem of selecting suitable means to make the Empire service available to listeners in a dependency, is part of the wider problem of devising local broadcasting systems with as wide a coverage as possibBHo which reference will be made later in this Report, but we desire meanwhile to record the great importance which we attach in principle to the promotion by all practicable means of increased reception locally of the Empire service. 6 . We shall not attempt here to assess the direct benefits which listeners in any Colonial community may derive by way of enter tainment or recreation alone from the Empire service ; these are benefits for which the prospective beneficiaries might well be ex pected themselves to pay by way of licence fees and by the purchase of suitable receiving sets, or by subscription to a local wire broad casting system, and their readiness to do so will to a large extent afford a measure of their view of the entertainment and recreation value of the service. 7. There are, however, considerations involved which go beyond this primarily financial aspect of the question. The Ullswater Com mittee, in their report, instanced the world-wide transmissions of broadcasts by His late Majesty King George V at Christmas and of the Jubilee celebrations as outstanding examples of the value of linking the Empire by broadcasting, and the Secretary of State in his circular despatch of the 8 th May, 1935, referred, in connection with such broadcasts, to the “ opportunities offered to listeners assembled in masses and groups to take part in ceremonial and similar occasions of high importance in which, in circumstances psychologically favourable, they may be impressed with a more vivid realization of their connection with the Empire ”. These views as to the significance which the Empire service can have on certain occasions need no endorsement from us. Apart from these special occasions, the Empire service has a significance which cannot be measured in terms of entertainment value. Regular daily contact with the Home Country (and at times with other parts of the Empire) and the repeated projection on the minds of listeners overseas of British culture and ideas, and all that this implies must exert a great influence. The effect of this in the long run is per haps the more valuable, because it is neither direct nor deliberate. Its importance cannot be assessed in a positive manner. It will vary in different territories with the race and education of the listeners and according to the extent to which they are subjected to other influences, whether these be foreign wireless propaganda, films or the Press, and the exent also to which it can displace these influences. The point which we wish to make here is that there aie considerations involved outside the entertainment function of3 s to which its contents are suit- that there must be large sections lencies to which a European pro- nake little appeal.)

General Considerations. 8. We have so far confined our attention to the Empire service, but any local system designed for the re-broadcasting or re-dis tribution by wire of the Empire service would, of course, be suit able also for the distribution of locally originated programmes and material and conversely, any system designed for the latter purpose would be suitable, or could be readily adapted, for the former. The considerations described in the latter part of the preceding para graph necessarily apply also to locally originated programmes and should be taken into account in the application of the general propo sition regarding the financing of Colonial broadcasting which we found it necessary to adopt at the outset of our deliberations. This proposition, which was advanced by the Colonial Office representa tives on this Committee, and from which the rest of us were not in a position to dissent, is that no dependency should be expected to incur a substantial and permanent financial loss on the equipment and maintenance of a broadcasting system designed solely for the provision of entertainment or almost entirely for that purpose. Wire Broadcasting. 9. Applying this principle to the two systems—wire broadcasting and wireless broadcasting—we considered first wire broadcasting. Experience in West Africa and elsewhere appears to indicate that a wire broadcasting system could be installed with comparatively small capital outlay, and, given a minimum number of subscribers in a compact area such as Lagos, Accra or Freetown, and an annual subscription by listeners of say £3 (including the rent of the loud speaker) could, after a short time, be run without loss or even at a profit. Information regarding the system is contained in the Secretary of State’s circular despatch of the 8th May, 1935, but we would draw attention to recent development in the Gold Coast; there wire broadcasting systems installed at Accra and Sekondi have been or are being extended by feeder lines to sub-stations in the neighbouring towns of Achimota and Takoradi respectively. From the point of view of subscribers, reception by wire has a great advantage over the ordinary receiving set, in that it is prac tically fool-proof and requires no heavy initial outlay or expenditure, other than the annual subscription. In short, for them it is cheaper and simpler. And moreover, since the central receiving set may be presumed to be capable of much better results than the 37572 A 3receiving set which any private listener might be expected to have, overseas stations, such as Daventry, redistributed by wire are clearly more efficiently received by this method than by direct reception on a receiving set. The very limitation of the listener to the. programme which the exchange distributes has the advantage that the programmes with which he is supplied can therein be controlled and objectionable wireless propaganda excluded. system, however, must, to be an economic proposition, be con fined to restricted areas of a certain minimum population density, i.e., in general to towms and large villages. Such a system could not, therefore, cover the. whole or in general, anything but a small part of a Colony; but we cannot escape the conclusion that, unless a dependency is in a position to attempt something more ambitious, it should at least make a start with the installation of wire broad casting systems in suitable areas. 10. In this connection the possibility of carrier frequency trans mission over existing telephone lines should receive careful con sideration as a means of reaching areas in a dependency which might not otherwise be within reach of a local centre of programme dis tribution without expensive and powerful transmitting apparatus. By the use of carrier frequencies, it is practicable to transmit programmes over an ordinary telephone line without appropriating all telephone channels on that line and thereby immobilizing it for simultaneous telephone communication. This method may offer possibilities in the development of Colonial broadcasting. Thus if two places A and B in a Colony—which may be hundreds of miles apart—are already connected by telephone circuits of sufficiently good quality, it would be possible to transmit a programme over the telephone wire from A to B (or vice versa) wdiich could be picked up by suitable apparatus at B and fed out to a subsidiary system covering the vicinity of B, of which B would become the centre of distribution. (This method can be used of course not only for the transmission to point B of programmes originated at A but also for the transmission to point B of oversea programmes received at A by wireless; in both cases however, the cost of adapting the existing trunk telephone circuit for carrier frequency transmission would of course have to be compared with the cost of the alternative method of installing a central wireless receiver at point B.) It is important to realize, however, that the method depends on the existence of telephone circuits of fairly high quality. We are unable to say, in the absence of specific information from each dependency, as to the quality and netwmrk of the telephone system, how far this development is likely to assist in the problem of securing the coverage of any given territory, but it is doubtful whether in a number of territories the telephone system, in its present condition, will be capable of any extensive adaptation to the system and it is clear that even where it is, the areas which can be covered by wore broadcasting will still form only a small part of the populated area./ I stener might be expected to have, ntry, redistributed by wire are by this method than by direct le very limitation of the listener mge distributes has the advantage i he is supplied can therein be iless propaganda excluded.^The n economic proposition, be con- lin minimum population density, e villages.

We are driven to the conclusion that, to secure any real development of Colonial broadcasting in the larger dependencies, the establishment of wireless broadcasting systems will be necessary. B uf^w hile wire broadcasting is an experiment w’hich can readily be mistaken in any considerable centre of population, because there is a fair prospect that it may pay its own way, the same cannot be said of wireless broadcasting. Such information as we have indicates that the establishment and operation of a system of local wireless broadcasting may be expected to involve a heavy capital outlay and a substantial recurring loss for some years in all but the largest and most heavily populated territories. This esti mate off ours, however, takes no account of the possibilities of revenue from advertisement or sponsored programmes, which in certain territories might be quite large, and while we should be sorry to see the extensive development of advertisement as a feature of Colonial broadcasting programmes, we consider that it would be better to have a broadcasting system partially financed by such advertisement than to have no broadcasting system at all. Such advertisement should not exceed a fixed small percentage of pro gramme time. 12. We consider also that careful consideration should be given to the possibility of the part-time use for broadcasting of radio tele phone transmitters in territories where they exist or are in contemplation. 13. Even when due allowance is made for the enhancement of revenue by advertisement or for the part-time use of radio telephone transmitters, it seems clear that the establishment of wireless broad casting in most dependencies may involve serious financial considera tions, and before these dependencies can be invited to undertake such commitments, it seems necessary to examine closely just what the aim of such broadcasting should be and how 'far, even wdth comparatively large financial outlay, it is likely to be attained. IV.—THE AIMS OF COLONIAL BROADCASTING. 14. We envisage the development of Colonial broadcasting—and its justification—not only as an instrument of entertainment for Europeans and others of similar education and means, who can for the most part listen in direct to Daventry and other stations on short-wave receiving sets, but also as an instrument of advanced administration, an instrument, not only and perhaps not even primarily for the entertainment but rather for the enlightenment and education of the more backward sections of the population and for their instruction in public health, agriculture, etc. Only develop ment along these lines would, we feel, justify any large outlay by Colonies and where there is no real prospect of such development,6 broadcasting stations must, we think, be more or less self-support- ing. Conversely, we feel that any promising development in this direction would certainly justify expenditure on the part of a Colony, and we consider that the potentialities of this instrument of adminis tration are so great that at least some expenditure is demanded of Colonial Governments by way of experiment and investigation 15. These remarks do not apply, of course, with equal force to all dependencies. We have in mind, in particular, the large mass of Africans (i.e., other than that small minority whose circum stances and standard of education are such that their broadcasting requirements are similar to those of Europeans). We understand that there is very little known as to the likely reactions of these people to broadcasting ; as to whether and to what extent it would appeal to them after its initial novelty had gone ; as to what extent in particular they could be persuaded to listen to educational and instructional broadcasts ; as to what extent such instruction would have to be combined with entertainment broadcasting ; and as to what form of lighter broadcasts would be most likely to appeal. These are fundamental problems which demand investigation before substantial progress can be made, and which could, it is suggested, be investigated without undue expenditure in certain territories. In Kenya, for example, which lends itself to such an experiment by reason of the fact that a broadcasting station exists at Nairobi within range of native communities, we understand that suggestions have already been made for the installation of receiver and loud speaker equipment at selected points with a view to carrying out such experiment. The problems referred to above appear, in fact, closely similar to those problems of the native reactions to films which, we are informed, are at present being investigated in East Africa by the Bantu Education Cinema Experiment, and it may be that the reception of broadcasts in conjunction with the reception Of films by natives may offer a partial solution of the problem. 16. The experiment which is at present going on in Palestine represents, no doubt, a more advanced stage. There, central receivers connected to loud speaker equipment are being installed in schools, halls, etc., in about one hundred villages of a population of over one thousand each, with a view to the diffusion of broad casts in Arabic. 17. Educational broadcasting apparently has been carried out in some areas in Ceylon, but this, we understand, is more in the nature of the broadcasts for schools which take place in this country, and although we believe that such educational broadcasting has an important place in the Colonies as well as in this country, it has little bearing on the problem referred to above. 18. We have considered in the foregoing, the question of broad casting as an instrument of entertainment and have concluded that, | o* at nstfiU hd &gt; to tut baa tx laqc i 9£U)0 4c! i Ife7 as such, it should be self-supporting, and we have suggested that, in many territories, this condition could be satisfied, if not by niieless broadcasting, at any rate by wire broadcasting in suitable aieas. We have qualified this by pointing out that even entertain ment broadcasts from British sources and in particular the Empire s(njyice, may have over a period a considerable beneficial influence would justify some Government loss on expenditure to piomote their reception. We have gone on to point out, however, that broadcasting should be regarded as an important function of administration which might justify considerable expenditure and which, at least, demands careful investigation by all Colonial Gov ernments, and we have outlined the aims which we think should be pursued. V.—COMMUNAL LISTENING. 19. It is, of course, clear that the extent to which these aims can be attained is directly proportional to the number of the popula tion which can be reached by any broadcasting system or combina tion of systems in a dependency. Those w r ho can afford a sufficiently good receiving set will, in general, be able to listen in direct to Daventry and other stations, and it is not primarily for such that anv local broadcasting system is required ; they would, in any case, be in a very small minority. There will be a larger number who will be able to afford or will prefer for some reason to make the smaller annual subscription to a wore broadcasting system, if such is a\ailable to them, but the number of people who can afford even this wdll still, no doubt, constitute only a small proportion of the population. The vast majority of the population then can only be provided for by the installation at the receiving points of any system, whether it be wireless or wire broadcasting, of central receivers or equipment connected to loud speakers installed in schools, halls, public squares and other places of public assembly. This idea is being developed in Palestine as has been pointed out above, and is, it is understood, very popular in other territories where it has been tried to some extent. It should present no technical difficulty at points where signals of sufficient strength are received. In some cases it may be possible to impose small charges on the audience to recoup the broadcasting authorities for their outlay ; in many cases, however, this may not be possible, particularly where the broadcasts are primarily educational in nature and the outlay would then have to be regarded as an administrative charge on the Colonial Government concerned. Such central points of reception would necessarily be limited to compact communities of a minimum size, although listeners might be prepared to come a short distance to the central point. There will remain however a number of the population both unable to afford a receiving installation and without access to these central receiving points.VI.—CHOICE OF EQUIPMENT AND WAVE-LENGTHS FOR COLONIAL BROADCASTING. 20. The extent to which a broadcasting system can cover the population of a territory will, in the larger territories, be limited, not only as indicated above, by the nature of the population distri bution, but also by the range of the transmitting centre or cei^^tj. In this connection we have already dealt in paragraphs 9 and 10 with both the possibilities and the limitations of wire broadcasting. We turn now to the question of wireless broadcasting. The choice •of suitable wave-lengths which will secure, from an economic and technical point of view, the optimum coverage of the territory depends on a number of considerations into which we enter more fully in the subsidiary report w r hich forms Appendix II to this interim report. Briefly, the ideal solution in normal circumstances for a large dependency would probably be a chain of medium-wave stations so arranged as to cover the whole territory; but in most cases this may be ruled out as impracticable on grounds of expense. Tailing that, the next best solution is probably a medium-wave transmitter to serve the most densely populated area of a depen dency, together with a short or intermediate wave transmitter to serve outlying areas. Even this, however, may be too expensive for many territories and in some cases, particularly where the population is scattered throughout a large area, as in the Fiji Islands, the only possible solution within the financial means of the territory may be a short or intermediate wave broadcasting •station of which the latter would probably be preferable. The use of short or intermediate wave broadcasting in the dependencies, however, raises, from the international point of view, questions of some difficulty to which w^e have found it necessary to give special consideration. On that point our view, briefly, is that since the ultimate solution in many dependencies is probably to be found in the use of weaves in the intermediate band of 80-200 metres, the authorities should consider the possibility of securing, at the next International Conference at Cairo in 1938, the allocation for broad casting of waves within these limits. Pending international agree ment we consider that some use might nevertheless be made of these wave-lengths on low power and where freedom from inter ference with other services can be assured. As regards the short- waves (10-80 metres) any application to use them would require the most careful consideration in the light, on the one hand of local circumstances and on the other of the difficulties of interference with other stations. 21 . It is important to observe that wireless broadcasting and wire broadcasting are in no way mutually exclusive, but are rather complementary. Within the range of transmission of a broadcast ing station, the possibilities of increasing the number of listeners by wire distribution should always be investigated, and outside thatrange the possibility of small independent broadcasting centres should be considered. For example, centres which could not be reached by long-distance broadcasting either by wire or wireless from the main programme distribution centre or centres of a terri tory might, in certain cases, work independently of the system by means of a local wire system which might, if equipped with a suit- aD^:receiver, redistribute the Empire programme or might, if local programme material is available, distribute that. Adminis trative, educational, agricultural and medical officers might, for example, be able to make use of such a system for instructional broadcasts. 22. When all allowance is made for methods of this kind, how ever, it will be seen that there must remain, at any rate in the present stage of scientific development, a substantial portion of the population outside the reach of broadcasting. This does not in validate our previous conclusions ; the portions of Colonial popula tions which can be reached by local broadcasting systems should still be sufficiently large to justify the development of such a system to the fullest possible extent in accordance with the principles which w r e have outlined. VII.—APPLICATION OF ABOVE PRINCIPLES TO INDIVIDUAL TERRITORIES. 23. We have so far confined ourselves to principles which we consider of fairly general validity. The precise application of these principles to individual territories with a view to the establishment of suitable broadcasting systems presents considerable difficulty and requires a knowledge of local conditions, which we do not possess. Nevertheless, we feel that we shall not have completed the task wffiich has been set us until we have made such definite recommen dations, at any rate in regard to those territories wdiich have not already a system capable of adaptation and extension along the lines described aboVfe. We are fortunate in having resources of technical advice available, greater than those of perhaps most dependencies, and we believe, from despatches which the Secretary of State has received from certain dependencies, that a number of Colonial Governments would welcome specific recommendations in their own case from the Secretary of State, based on technical advice such as that at the disposal of this Committee. In order to enable us to make such recommendations where they may be desired, we have drawn up a questionnaire (Appendix III) which we suggest should be circulated to Colonial Governments for completion in such cases. It would be desirable that these Governments, in returning the completed questionnaire, should, where they are in a position to do so, accompany it by definite proposals for the development of local broadcasting. It would be helpful also if each of these Govern ments would indicate whether it would find it possible to send one of its technical experts to this country to co-operate with experts herein the determination of the most suitable broadcasting system or systems for the territory in question, or alternatively to pay for the visit to that territory of a technical expert from here, if such an expert were available. 24. The possibilities of co-operation between adjacent territories in the matter of the provision of broadcasting facilities, and alsqA^h regard to the preliminary question of securing expert tecflfiical advice should not be overlooked. VIII.—GOVERNMENT CONTROL. 25. We have not yet in this report dealt with the question of the conduct of broadcasting services wholly or partly by companies or individuals licensed by a Colonial Government. We do not think that there is, in regard to most dependencies, much to be said in favour of such an arrangement; the profit which is clearly a neces sary condition of any company undertaking such a project would merely be an extra charge on the service, and private control has obvious (though not insuperable) obstacles to the development of the service as a social and administrative service. Exceptionally where Cable and Wireless, Limited, conduct all the external wire less services of a dependency they might be able to save on main tenance and staff charges by comparison with Government working ; but where for such a reason it would be more economical for them to operate the wireless broadcasting service, their operations might, we think, be confined to the technical conduct and maintenance of the service, the programme side being in the hands of the Govern ment. Similarly, in certain territories where the internal telephone system is conducted by a company, that company might be in a better position than the Government to arrange for the installation and the technical maintenance of a ware broadcasting system. The view may be held also in some quarters that in certain dependen cies it would be embarrassing for the Government to be responsible for all programmes broadcast. We are unable to* attach much force to this argument in the case of most dependencies ; but where such a consideration may be held to have weight , it mav be desirable to set up an organization on the lines of the British Broadcasting ( orporation, i.e., a semi-autonomous body responsible to the Government. This, however, probably represents a more advanced stage of development than that which will be reached by most dependencies in the near future, and in general, we consider that broadcasting activity, as a service of cardinal importance, should be under the direct control of the Colonial Government. Govern ment control, in so far as it relates to programme policy, should be vested in a committee off standing to which draft programmes would be submitted in advance at suitable periods. The precise compo sition of such a committee and in particular the extent, if anv, to which it would contain unofficial representation, would depend on local circumstances, but it should, we think, be presided over bv11 an official of high standing and should contain representatives of the departments interested in the use of broadcasting as an adminis trative service, i.e., the Education, Public Health and Agricultural Departments. Where it may not be immediately practicable for the Government to take over complete control of the broadcasting sy^e m, arrangements should be made for securing to the Govern- {n^t, when desired, a proportion of the broadcasting time for Government broadcasting, particularly broadcasting of an instruc tional nature, and provision should also be made to ensure that the programmes generally should contain a substantial proportion of British material and especially British news. 26. The Committee desire to record their appreciation of the ready and efficient assistance which has been rendered to them by Mr. Megson in his capacity as Secretary. PLYMOUTH. R. V. VERNON. H. F.

Definitions of certain Terms used in tne Interim Report. 1. “ Wireless broadcasting —The transmission by means of wireless (Hertzian) waves of programmes intended for reception by the general public. 2. “ Wire broadcasting ”—The transmission of programmes from ever source to listeners over wire. ” 3. “ Broadcasting ”—The general term used in the Report to cover both the above systems. 4. “ Rebroadcasting ”—The wireless broadcasting from a central point of programmes received at that point by wireless. o. “ Redistribution by wire —The wire broadcasting from a central point of programmes received at that point either by wire or wireless. 6. “ Redistribution ”—The general term used in the Report to cover both the above forms of retransmission to listeners. 7. Wave-lengths— Short—10-80 metres. Intermediate—80-200 metres. Medium—200-545 metres. Long—over 545 metres. APPENDIX H. Subsidiary Report on the Choice of Suitable Wave-lengths for Colonial Broadcasting. It will be convenient for the purpose of this memorandum to divide the wave-lengths into Short—10-80 metres, Intermediate—80-200 metres, Medium—200-545 metres, Long—over 545 metres, although a different classification is recognised internationally. 2. In the long-waves there are no bands allocated by the General Radio Communication Regulations Madrid, 1932, to broadcasting outside Europe and certain other limited areas. In the medium-w r aves the whole range 200-545 metres is allocated to broadcasting. In the short-waves the following bands are allocated to broadcasting: — 48-78—50 metres. 31 • 25—31 • 58 metres. 25-21—25-64 metres. 19-54—19-87 metres. 16-85—16-90 metres. 13-92—13-99 metres. 11-28—11-72 metres. In the intermediate range of 80-200 metres no bands are allocated specifically to broadcasting. Article /, paragraph 1, of the General Radio Communications Regulations however provides that the administrations of contracting countries may13 assign any frequency to any radio-electric station under their authority upon the sole condition that no interference with any service of another country results therefrom, and under this clause it is open to an adminis tration, subject to the proviso stated, to assign frequencies for broad casting outside the bands specifically allocated by the regulations for broad casting. Under this dispensation, wave-lengths within the intermediate range are in fact being used for broadcasting, notably in the Netherlands Indies, and experimentally in certain British dependencies, e.g., MtStya. 3. The great advantage of short or intermediate-wave transmission over medium or long-w’ave transmission is that a comparatively low pow r er, and therefore cheap, short or intermediate-wave transmitter has a very wide potential range. Owing to the phenomenon of “ skip-distance ” it is, however, liable to be badly received just beyond the immediate vicinity of the transmitter, and at greater distances reception may be subject to “ fading ”. While, therefore, a comparatively low power short or inter mediate-wave transmitter would potentially be able to reach all parts of even the biggest colony, reception for the above reasons would be unreliable. A medium or long-wave transmitter, on the other hand, is relatively limited in range for a given power, but within that limited range reception is comparatively reliable and good. In tropical regions atmospherics may modify these conditions appreciabl} 7 as their prevalence is much more marked on medium and long-waves than on the shorter waves, so much so that in some regions it may be impracticable to use long or medium-waves effectively This applies w r ith greater force to long-waves since the level of atmospheric interference increases rapidly with increasing w r ave-length. Short-wave transmissions on the other hand might be subject to severe interference by the numerous and frequently' no doubt more powerful short wave stations of other countries. This objection does not apply to the same extent to the intermediate wave-lengths. On the whole the ideal solution in normal circumstances for a large colony would be a chain of medium-wave stations so arranged as to cover the whole territory, but this may be ruled out as impracticable on grounds of expense. Failing that, the next best solution is probably a medium-wave transmitter to serve the most densely populated area of a colony together with a short-wave or intermediate-wave transmitter to serve outlying areas, which is, in fact, the method at present adopted by the broadcasting station of Cable and Wireless, Limited, at Nairobi, Kenya, and in certain other parts of the Empire. Even this, however, may be too expensive for many territories, and in some of these cases, particularly where the population is scattered throughout a large area as in the Fiji Islands, the only possible solution within the financial means of the territory may be a short or intermediate- wave broadcasting station. Where a short- or intermediate-wave trans mitter is used it may of course be necessary to employ diflFerent wave-lengths according to the time of day, season and local conditions. 4. Short-wave transmission has also, in the view of certain colonies, the advantage that since its range extends beyond the confines of the colony in question, it can “ put the colony on the map ” for broadcasting pur poses. This consideration is one which may in some cases have a certain commercial value but which should not in our opinion be a deciding factor. o. There are, however, certain serious obstacles to the widespread use of short-wave broadcasting in the colonies, namely that by reason of its potentially wide range it is liable to cause interference with transmissions from other countries. It is in the consideration of these dfficulties that it is convenient to sub-divide the shorter w a\ e-length i anges into w a\ e lengths below about 80 metres (short) and those between 80-200 metres (intermediate). Both have the advantage that on a comparatively low power transmitter their potential range is sufficient for even the largest/ 14 colony. Below about 80 metres, however, the range may be so great that the transmissions will be liable to cause interference with those of other shortwave stations (and conversely, as has been pointed out to be “ jammed ” by such transmissions); over about 80 metres this danger becomes con siderably less. From this point of view, therefore, the range between 80- 200 metres would probably in many cases be more satisfactory for purposes of Colonial broadcasting than that below 80 metres. 6. No bands between 80-200 metres are however specifically allo^ ed to broadcasting, and these wave-lengths are in fact allocated by the General Radio Communication Regulations to other services. It would, therefore, be a condition of broadcasting on wave-lengths within this range that it should not interfere with any of these services, and any application on the part of a colony to broadcast within this range would require careful consideration in the light of this requirement. In view, however, of the value of the intermediate wave-lengths for purposes of Colonial broad casting we recommend that the authorities should consider the possibility of securing at the next International Conference at Cairo in 1938 the allocation for broadcasting of waves within these limits. Pending inter national agreement we consider that some use might still be made of these wave-lengths on low power and where freedom from interference with other services can be assured. 7. With regard to the wave-lengths below about 80 metres it has been pointed out above that the use of such wave-lengths is open to the objec tion that they are liable both to interfere with and to be interfered with by similar transmissions from other broadcast stations. It is true that certain bands within that range have been specifically allocated to broad casting but within these bands no allocation has been made by international agreement as between different stations and effective use of these bands is at present dependent on a considerate attitude by administrations to the needs of other countries. These short-wave bands allocated to broadcasting are already highly congested and after consultation with the General Post Office and the British Broadcasting Corporation, the Secretary of State found it necessary to lay down the principle that, while he did not con sider that there was sufficient ground for placing a complete ban in the meanwhile on the use of short-waves for broadcasting in the colonies, the situation demanded that such short-wave broadcasting should be con fined to territories whose needs could not be satisfied by the use of the longer waves. In view of the difficulties of interference already referred to we do not find ourselves in a position to recommend any relaxation of this principle, and we consider that any application by a colony to use shoi t-w aves for broadcasting would require careful consideration in the light, on the one hand of the international difficulties, and on the other hand of local circumstances.

C.C.I.F. : Budapest, White Book, 1934, Vol. Ill, p. 166. Translation (see paragraph 12 of Appendix III). Band of frequencies effectively transmitted. In order that the transmission of speech and music may be good, the band of frequencies effectively transmitted bj T the entire circuit relaying the broadcast transmission should be from 50 to 6,400 pps. at least. For a frequency to be considered effectively transmitted, the equivalent at this frequency should be less than 0-5 N. or 4-3 Dbs. at the most lower than the equivalent at 800 pps. Transmitted power. In order to reduce the harmful effects of cross-talk and non-linear dis tortion, the power transmitted during a broadcast transmission should not, at any point on the international circuit, exceed 500 mW.17 Maximum volume. The measurement of maximum or minimum volume transmitted by the circuit during the broadcast transmission should be made provisionally by means of a maximum impulse indicator intended for a frequency band of 30 to 7,000 pps. and fulfilling the conditions prescribed for impulse indicators (see Vol. IY, Part 3). circuits used for the relay of broadcast transmissions should permit a volUre, which may vary over a range of 4-6 N. (40 Dbs.), to be transmitted satisfactorily. Non-linear distortion. For the maximum power and for a certain frequency within the band of frequencies effectively transmitted, the attenuation of harmonic distortion should at least be equal to 2-3 N. or 20 Dbs. (provisional limit). The broadcasting organizations have observed that the effects of non-linear distortion are already noticeable in a broadcast transmission when the attenuation of harmonic distortion is 3-2 N. or 28 Dbs. (This value was adopted in Avis No. 49 of the C.C.l.R. at Copenhagen as a value of attenuation of harmonic distortion for broadcast transmitters.) Transient phenomena. The index of phase distortion for a frequency of 6,400 pps. must not exceed 10 msecs, on a circuit used for broadcast transmissions. On the other hand, a limit of 80 msecs, is considered as provisionally admissible for this index at 50 pps. on a circuit used for broadcast transmissions, subject to modification according to later experiments to be made on this subject, and also according to later decisions which might be made for the extension towards the low frequency (for example: to 30 pps.) of the band of frequencies effectively transmitted by the circuits for broadcast transmissions. Compensation of the effects of temperature variations. It is necessary to make suitable arrangements to compensate the effects of temperature variations on the conditions of equalisation of broadcast circuits. Cross-talk. The attenuation of near- or far-end cross-talk for speech between two circuits being used for broadcast transmissions, or between one of these circuits and a telephone circuit, should be 9 N. or 78 Dbs. at least for cable lines, and 7 N. or 61 Dbs. at least for open-wire lines. Jn the case whore it is necessary to use lines with a cross-talk attenuation lower than the above values for the relay of broadcast transmissions, the maximum power applied to the input of these lines must necessarily be reduced. Noise. (a) Noise voltage at points of minimum level. At points where the relative level of voltage is minimum, the ratio between the maximum useful voltage (Note i) and the noise voltage (line noise and cross-talk) must be at least 1000/1 (6'9 N. or 60 Dbs.) for cable circuits, and at least 400/1 (6 N. or 52 Dbs.) for open-wire lines. (b) Noise voltage at the end of Section B (Note ii). The noise voltage measured objectively’ (Note iii) at the end of section B when closed by an impedance of 600 Ohms, must always be less than 1/1000 part of the maximum useful voltage defined above. The ratio between the maximum value of the useful voltage and the noise voltage must always be greater than 10.&gt; , / A ru;. baz &gt; 'i (37572-29) Wt. 16611-3869 375 9/36 P.

Question of establ'Ls_bing_ a statio n in India .'' Memorandum by India Office . This question has been discussed with the Government of India. It was explained to them that a project for a station in Cyprus was under examination, but that the question might arise whether it would not be better to aim at a bigger scheme and, in particular, whether a station in India could not deal with a larger area including the Middle East. It was pointed out that, if the bigger scheme were decided on and India co-operated in this way, some subsidy might reasonably be asked for towards the cost of the station, and that the latter might also be useful for the broadcasting of ordinary programmes for reception in India. With reference to our immediate requirements in the Middle East, the Government of India were asked: (1) Whether a medium wave station in India could reach Palestine and Syria. (2) If so, what would it cost and how long would it take to build. (3) How far India is in a position to provide entertainment programmes suitable for the Middle East, and whether provision could be made for the translation of news bulletins into, and their transmission in, Arabic. (4) Whether any political embarrassment would be anticipated in connection with the scheme. The Government of India’s replies to these questions are: - (1) Such a station could reach Palestine and Syria, but for adequate reception it would be necessary to have a power of 500 kilowatts (the proposed Cyprus station would be 50 kilowatts). Transmission would not be »$&lt; ■ ' • * technically satisfactory, except between 8 and 11 p.m. (Syrian time).(2) The cost is estimated at about £150,000 for the transmitter and another £50,000 for the buildings. (The cost of a Cyprus station is estimated at £50,000). The station wtpuld take two years to build. (A Cyprus station might be ready by the end of 1938). The cost of maintaining the station, if used at full capacity for Indian programmes with a two-hour Arabic programme daily, would be^ about £85,000 a year. (The Palestine station costs £33,500 and a Cyprus station would probably cost less.) (3) Modern Arabic is hardly understood in India and neither modern nor classical Arabic is spoken. Translators and announcers would, therefore, probably have to be imported. For entertainment reliance would have to be placed largely, if not entirely, on gramophone records. For these and for technical reasons, it would not be possible to arrange programmes longer than two or perhaps three hours a day. (4) Certain political difficulties are anticipated by the Government of India. Misapprehensions might arise as to the object of the broad casts, which would of course be concerned to justify His Majesty's Government's policy and not that of the Government of India. The Government of India feel that it would be difficult for them to justify broadcasts to the Middle East in Arabic, a language not normally employed for Indian broadcasting, whereas it might be easier for His Majesty’s Government to do so. With reference to the possibility of utilising the station for Indian programmes as well as the Arabic programmes, the Government of India state that the establishment of a station of the magnitude required for the latter purpose would not fit in with future broad casting developments in India which they contemplate, and which would lie in the direction of smaller-power stations in the Provinces with a view to enabling them to initiate a policy of rural development. They add that the staff of All-India Radio is fully occupied with carrying through plans already in hand, which must be completed as soon as possible, and is not at present in a position toundertake the construction of a large station of the kind in question. In view of all these considerations the Government of India would not be able to support a scheme for Arabic broadcasting from India. It seems clear that, apart from any other considerations, the cost of erecting a station in India capable of doing what is required, and the time which it would take to set it up, render it impracticable to adopt this means of providing Arabic broadcasts for the Middle East. INDIA OFFICE. 6th September 1937.MrCroft, Please see the notes at P.Z. 5511/37. Sir Kingsley Wood has suggested that the India Office should circulate a memorandum to the Cabinet Committee on Arabic Broadcasting. The draft of a memorandum is attached. It is clear that for reasons of cost and time alone the setting up of a 500 kilowatt station in India is out of the question as a solution of the immediate problem of Arabic broadcasting. }uJCX t (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPSKTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GQiT.)

It was explained to them that a project for a station in Cyprus was under examination, but that the question might arise whether it would not be better to aim at a bigger scheme and, in particular, whether a station in India could not deal with a larger area including the Middle East. It was pointed out that, if the bigger scheme were decided on and India co-operated in this way, some subsidy might reasonably be asked for towards the cost of the station, and that the latter might also be useful for the broadcasting of ordinary programmes for reception in India. With reference to our immediate requirements in the Middle East, the Government of India were asked (1) Whether a medium wave station in India could reach Palestine and Syria. (2) If so, what would it cost and how long would it take to build. (3) How far India is in a position to provide entertainment progranmes suitable for the Middle East, and whether provision could be made for the translation'of news bulletins into, and their transmission in, Arabic. (4) Whether any political embarrassment would be anticipated in connection with the scheme. The Government of India 1 s replies to these questions are: - (1) Such a station could reach Palestine and Syria, but for adequate reception it would be necessary to have a power of 500 kilowatts (the proposed Cyprus station would be 50 kilowatts). Transmission would not be technically satisfactory except/except between 8 and 11 p.m. (Syrian time). (2) The cost is estimated at about £150,000 for the transmitter and another £50,000 for the buildings. — s (The cost of a Cyprus Station is estimated at £50,000.) The station would take two years to build. (A Cyprus station might be ready by the end of 1938.) The cost of maintaining the station, if used at full capacity for Indian programmes with a two-hour Arabic programme daily, would be about £85,000 a year. (The Palestine station costs £33,500 and a Cyprus Station would probably cost less.) (3) Modem Arabic is hardly understood in India and n neither modem nor classical Arabic is spoken. Translators and announcers would, therefore, probably have to be imported, i^'or entertainment reliance would have to be placed largely, if not entirely, on gramophone records. For these and for technical reasons, it would not be possible to arrange programmes longer than two or perhaps three hours a day. (4) Certain political difficulties are anticipated by the Cjovemment of India. Misapprehensions might arise as to the object of the broadcasts, which would of course be concerned to justify H.M.G.’s policy and not that of the Govemmenl of India. The Government of India feel that it would be difficult for them to justify broadcasts to the Middle East in Arabic, a language not normally employed for Indian broadcasting, whereas it might be easier for H.M.G. to do so. With reference to the possibility of utilising the station for Indian programmes as well as the Arabic programmes, the Government of India state that the establishment of a station of the magnitude required for the latter purpose would not fit in with future broadcasting developments in India which they contemplate, and which would lie in the direction of smaller-power stations in the Provinces with a view to enabling them to initiate a policy of rural development. They add that the staff of All-India Radio is fully occupied with carrying through plans already in hand, v/hich must be completed as soon as possible, and is not at present in a position to undertake the construction of a large station of the kind in question. In view of all these considerations the Government of India would not be able to support a scheme for Arabic , broadcasting from India. . . . September, 1932. IvIt seems clear that, apart from any other considerations, the cost of erecting a station in India capable of doing what is required, and the time which it would take to set it up, render it impracticable to adopt this means of providing Arabic broadcasts for the Middle hast.

(J ^ -f J’AmK# Broadcasting. Their reply explains itself. (1) They disagree with the B.B.C. Expert who said the scheme was physically impossible because a medium wave station in India would not reach Syria and Palestine. But they consider that 500 Kilowatts would be necessary. This is a very large power indeed for a station, and compares with 50 Kilowatts which is suggested for the proposed Cyprus Station. On this account therefore, Cyprus is far preferable. Ah w/KaO /) UJJ f ( 2) They estimate the expenditure of the actual transmitter and building at £150,000^ This compares with £50,000 for the proposed Cyprus Station. ( 3) The provision of programmes in Arabic would not be easy, and all talent would have to be imported. This of course is true also of the Cyprus project. 'k/m au /*■« ItUaJ' Mi * (4) The total recurring cost of working the station full time would be about £90,000. (Those of the Cyprus station are estimated at less than £33,000). The Arabic programmes could only occupy a few hours a day, and clearly it would be wasteful not to use the rest of the time for Indian programmes. But a station of this magnitude would not fit in at all with the Government of India*s present scheme of broadcasting development. Incidentally their total wireless revenue from all India is only £125,000. In any case, their staff is too fully occupied to take on fresh construction of this size at present. (5) The Government of India also put forward strong political objections.^'It is not clear how far these objections are really valid, (for instance the reference to the International Convention appears to be off the mark) but it is quite clear that the Government of India themselves are influenced by them. In view of all these considerations the Government i of India are not prepared to support any scheme for a station in India.It is obviously out of the question to press the Government of India. The only action necessary seems to be for Sir Leonard Wakeley to send a copy of the telegram to Sir Kingsley Wood, to whom Sir Findlater Stews sent a copy of the telegram out. rt } 4 A draft for this purpose is attached. It will be noted that it raises the question whether the telegrams should be circulated to the Committee. (I understand ♦ that no agenda paper has yet been issued for the meeting, and its date is obscure. The Private Secretary is trying to discover when it is to be). i/’ *-» //' As Sir Kingsley Wood informed the Cabinet on 28tih July that a communication was being sent to India, he may think it desirable to circulate the correspondence. If so', i we need not object, but a sufficient alternative might be to circulate a short memo, summarising the result of the i correspondence, and this might perhaps be preferable, as some of the G. of I.’s arguments are better than others. The G. of I.'s financial arguments are convincing, but the particular political objections which they put forward do not seem to me to have much force; broadcasting to counter false statements or to explain H.M.G .*8 policy is not on all fours with propaganda on matters of internal politics. The reference to the Convention (to which Italy does not appear to be a party) is inept, as the is a mutual A ^ undertaking to refrain from incorrect statements likely to harm gpod international understanding. juJ ’ V ^ y 4 '‘ ! —~~~P.Z. 5511/37 Draft Paper.

A Committee of the Cabinet will shortly oe considering a proposal to establish a broadcasting station in Cyprus for the purpose of influencing Arabic opinion in the Middle East. It is probable that the question will be raised whether it would not be better to aim at something bigger and, in particular, whether a station in India could not deal with a larger area including the Middle East. One condition of the problem is that transmission would have to be by medium length waves since the receivers commonly used in the East cannot take short wave transmission. If the bigger scheme were decided upon with India as its base, some subsidy might reasonably be asked from the Treasury and it is possible that the station required for Imperial purposes might be valuable for broadcasting in India itself. The suggestion may, therefore, be of considerable interest to you and I should be glad to have your views. In particular, information on the following points would be very useful to the Cabinet Committee: (1) Could a medium wave length station be set up in India capable of reaching Palestine and Syria? (The contemplated Cyprus station could deal with the whole of the Middle East). (2) If so, what would it cost, in round figures, and how long would it take to build?(3) The object o£ the station would he to present in an objective but effective way the British point of view on matters affecting the areas covered. It would issue news bulletins controlled by an organisation at the Foreign Office, and in particular it would aim at counteracting misleading propaganda. But it wouldb e necessary to provide entertainment programmes to ensure that the news got across. Hoy; far are you in a position in India to provide programmes suitable for the Middle mast, which is the immediate problem? Presumably you could provide for the translation of news into, and its transmission in, Arabic. (4) Would you anticipate any interference from a Federal Ministry with the transmission of the kind of news described above or embarrassment in connection with scheme generally? I recognise that some of these questions may be difficult to answer; but I should be glad to have the most helpful answers you can give as early as possible but not later than the 24th August. The Cabinet Committee meets on tlie 1st September and I should like to be in a position to lay before them material on which they can decide whether or not the larger scheme is a practicable one.V Please see Lord Hood f s request for any observations on the Foreign Office memorandum of 29th July. The memorandum represents, I think, pretty correctly, what v/as agreed informally at the meeting the Foreign Office. I explained at the meeting that Sir Findlater Stewart was in touch concurrently v/ith Sir Kingsley Wood in regard to the possibility of using India as the base of operations, but in view of the opinion of the B.B.C. expert that broadcasting from India to the Middle East was technically impracticable, I agreeSthat Cyprus v/ould appear to be the better location. I spoke to Mr. Leeper on receipt of the Minutes, and explained that the Secretary of State v/as consulting the Viceroy privately on the v/hole matter, and that therefore it might be as well to omit any reference to India from the Minutes. He explained, hov/ever, that Sir Kingsley V/ood had specifically asked him to report on this aspect of the question, and that- - V 2 . it was therefore necessary for him to record the Committee’s conclusion on the matter. If, (v/hich seems very unlikely), the Viceroy’s reply to the Secretary of State's enquiry indicates that India might afford a suitable location, a note for the „ ) 'wMtJ . fcxVtAJ t** Cabinet can, of course, be conclusion in paragraph 5 of the Foreign Office memorandum. No action seems necessary pending the Viceroy's reply. &lt;°/F I1. Vs ' ^ / (^ H I S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAN NIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT) .SECRET. A.B.C.(37)2. COPY NO. CAB I N E T. COMMITTEE ON ARABIC BROADC ASTING. Proposed Broadcastin g S tation in Cyprus . Memorandum by Foreign Office. The details of this proposal have now been discussed by representatives of the Foreign Office, Colonial Office, India Office, General Post Office and the British Broadcasting Corporation. The following conclusions were reached:- 1. Administration . Like the Palestine station, which throughout the discussion was taken generally as a standard of comparison, the Cyprus station would be under local Government control. The staff, both administrative and technical, would be responsible to the Director and the Director to the Cyprus Government. In the absence of suitable technicians in the Government service, it is probable that the technical running of the station would have to be entrusted to Cables and Wireless Ltd., who are already resonsible for the telegraphic communications of Cyprus. This arrangement would not be without precedent: in Kenya, for instance, the same company run both the administrative and the technical sides of the local wireless station. 2. Programme s. The programmes wourd be openly intended for the whole Near Eastern and Levant area: no attempt would be made to maintain the fiction that they were intended only for Cyprus.They would consist of news bulletins and talks given out in English, Arabic, Greek and Turkish, and musical entertainment, both European and Oriental. So far as the nev/s service is concerned, the station would of course be able to rely upon the Empire News Service of the British Broadcasting Corporation and upon Reuter. Further, it would be provided with the special news service from the Foreign Office and from British diplomatic and colonial posts in the Near East, which is at present oeing organised for use by the Palestine Wireless Station. The entertainment programmes would present greater difficulty owing to the lack of local talent. Much, however, could be done on the European side by re-broadcasting the Daventry programmes, and on the Oriental side, translated talks and readings from Arabic and Turkish literature could be given, together with records of Oriental music. No doubt it would also be possible, upon occasion, to invite noted speakers and musicians to broadcast. 3. Staff . At this stage it is difficult to lay down exactly what staff a station of this kind would need; much depends upon the number of hours a day during which broadcasting is taking place. Assuming, however, that the station were broadcasting for five hours a day - which with programmes in four languages is not an excessive estimate - then, apart from the engineering staff, it would be necessary to have, as a minimum, a Programme Director, who would be head of the Station; a deputy Programme Director, who would act for him in his absence and would also be concerned with the English programmes; and one announcer each for the Arabic, Greek and Turkish programmes, who would probably also be concerned with the drawing up of those programmes and with any translation work connected with them. In addition to these, it would almost certainly be desirable to have a special news editor, who would receive and collate the various news services and prepare the news bulletins for translation.4. Cost of Installation and Maintenance. In order to cover the whole Near Eastern area satisfactorily, as far south as Aden and as far east as Iraq, a 50 Kilowatt station would he required. The cost of erecting this may be estimated at £50,000. The immediate need is for a medium-wave station, but in drawing up the plans it may be Veil to bear in mind the possibility of adding a short-wave installation at a later date. This extension would cost approximately a further £25,000 and is not recommended at the present stage. It would, however, cost very little more to leave room, when building the medium- wave station, for possible future short-wave equipment, and it is strongly recommended that this precaution should be taken. The addition of short-wave broadcasts would in no way hamper broadcasts on a medium-wave, since it is possible to emit the two programmes simultaneously. The number of owners of short-wave sets in the Near Eastern countries is at present small, but is likely to increase. As regards maintenance, the following are, approximately, the annual expenses of the Palestine station:- Administration and programme expenses £18,000 Programme Staff £ 7,500 Light, heat and power £ 6^000 Engineering £ 2,000 • - r Total: £33,500 The Cyprus Station would probably not prove so costJLy as programme expenses and salaries would almost certainly be less: engineering costs would be about the same. The entire cost of the station would have to be borne by H.M. Government, since the Cyprus Government would be unable to afford more than a negligible contribution. They might, however, be aole to present the necessary land and also perhaps a proportion of their revenue from wireless licences.*v The possibility oi' India as an alternative site for the proposed station was examined, but it was unanimously agreed that, for geographical reasons, it was far inferior to Cyprus. It is essential that broadcasts for the Near Eastern area should be emitted on a medium-wave and no medium-wave station in India could cover Palestine, Syria and Egypt satisfactorily. A similar station in Cyprus would, however, cover the whole area. 6 . Procedure . If the proposal to erect a British medium-wave station to serve the Near Eastern area is approved and if Cyprus is approved as the most suitable position for such a station, it is recommended that a competent expert should be sent to choose a site as soon as possible. Mr. Brasher, the Chief Engineer of the Palestine station, is at present on leave in this country and is due to return to Jerusalem in October. It is suggested that, provided the Palestine authorities have no objection, he should be instructed to proceed to Cyprus on the expiration of his leave with a view to making the necessary survey. He might be expected to report some time before Christmas of this year, and tenders could ac once be invited for the construction of the station. Thereafter, if H.M. Government were prepared to insist on the matter being treated as one of great urgency, the new station might be expected to be ready by the end of 1938. 7. War on the Air . Some anxiety has been expressed at our engaging on a wireless war with Italy in the Near East. This appears to misunderstand the object we have in view. It is the considered view of H.M. Government that British material re-armament is the best guarantee for European peace during5 . the next few years. Our weakness is a temptation to the aggressor not only to attack us, hut to attack others. In the same way any failure on our part to present our case properly in the Near East is not only a temptation to Italy to exploit our difficulties among peoples who have little or no access to the real facts of the situation, hut also tends to undo the effect of our re-armament in a part of the world where our interests are very vitally concerned. We have no intention of imitating the methods of the Bari broadcasts hy abusing or misrepresenting Italy or any other country. Our object is solely to maintain a reliable service of British news and to see to it that false or malicious reports are not left unchallenged. There is no more reason to suggest that this policy will lead to a War on the Air than that our re-armament will lead to war in Europe. If the contemplated news service in Arabic is properly conducted, it should have a steadying effect and on the principle that good news drives out bad should diminish rather than increase the tension in the Near East.

The Minister of Health, as Chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Arabic Broadcasts, reported that the question was to be considered on rather broader lines than in the Papers laid before the Cabinet last week at the Meeting referred to in the margin, and it had become necessary to send communications to India and elsewhere. In order to give time for these communications and adequate preparation, he had decided not to summon the Committee until AtW-September. The Foreign Secretary reported that the temporary scheme would be put in operation towards the end of August. The Cabinet took note of, and approved, the above statements.

It is probable that the question will be raised whether it would not be better to aim at something bigger and^in particular whether a station in India could not deal with ■j us wo 11—as the Middle East.

You will see that the question has been remitted to a Committee of Ministers which is to meet on September 1st. Meanwhile the Foreign Office are getting ahead with the consideration of detailed plans, and a departmental meeting is to be held to-morrow afternoon. It is understood that the Foreign Office are disposed not to take very seriously the suggestion that Arabic broadcasting might be undertaken from an Indian station. It is not certain whether the idea is feasible from the purely technical point of view, and it will be desirable to find this out in any case from the Government of India. If it is technically feasible it will, no doubt, be desirable for the Committee of Ministers to consider this possibility as well as the proposals for a station in Cyprus, and it is proposed to impress this point on the Foreign Office&lt;55 ^ fV '2 -w 2 . at to-morrow^ meeting. In the light of such information as may he forthcoming at the meeting&gt; it is proposed to telegraph to the Government of India asking for information on the technical side, and for their views on the question whether broadcasts of the type required could, if desired, he arranged in India. It is understood that the Foreign Office view k is that Cyprus wouldyhe an ideal spot, since it would he possible from there to broadcast not only Arabic programmes, but also programmes which would be of value for propaganda purposes in Eastern Europe or the Middle East.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the BROADCASTS. Secretary of State for Foreign affairs (C.P.185(37)) (Previous Reference: suggesting that, with a view to countering Italian wireless Cabinet 28 (37), Con- propaganda in the Near and Middle Bast by means of broad- clusion 2 ) casing from Jerusalem any information which it was desired to make public, a special officer with first-hand experience of Arab mentality should be attached to the i^ews Department of the Foreign Office, charged with duties detailed in the Memorandum. This proposal, however, would not completely meet the case, as Jerusalem was likely to remain in mandated territory, thus precluding the possibility of the fullest use being made of the broadcasting station there. The real need was a medium-wave station on British territory. The Cabinet were therefore asked to approve in principle, subject to examination by the Departments concerned of the technical and other details involved, the construction of a station in Cyprus, Irom ' hich all parts of the -^evant and the Near and Middle Bast could easily be reached. The total cost of erecting such a station was estimated at not more than £50,000, and the period of erection at approximately nine months. The Home Exchequer, however, would have to bear the greater part of both capital and maintenance costs, as contributions from Cyprus would be negligible. The question was raised as to whether the establishment of a broadcasting station in India, instead of in Cyprus had been considered. Doubts were expressed as to whether the erection of a station in India would not involve a good deal of delay, and also as to whether arable broadcasts would come appropriately from India.- 2 - a&amp;v Doubts were raised both as to whether a station costing £50,000 would be sufficiently powerful to prove effective for the purpose for which it was intended, and as to whether the scheme had been thought out sufficiently from the point of view of programmes providing sufficient attraction to secure listeners. A desire was expressed for information on the details of who was to be responsible for arranging the programmes, and of the extent to which they would be provided in Cyprus itself or by relaying, whether from England or elsewhere. The Cabinet agreed: (a) To approve the proposal that, as an immediate step, a special officer with first-hand experience of ^rab mentality should be attached to the News Department of the Foreign office, with the duty, firstly, of following theoutput of any anti- British wireless propaganda in the Near and Middle East; secondly, of collecting or receiving from other Government Departments any items of news to which, from the British point of view, it was desirableto give a wide circulation in that area; and, thirdly, of drafting in news bulletin form any such information or any announcements designed to counteract foreign propaganda. The bulletins so produced to be telegraphed to Palestine, where they would be translated into Arabic and broadcast from Jerusalem, though not necessarily in the exact form in which they were sent: (b) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows* The Minister of Bealth (in the Chair), The Lord Privy Seal, A Representative (Cabinet Minister of Under- 1T , Secretary of: The ireasury, The Foreign Office, The Dominions Office, The 'India Office, The Colonial Office, The Post Office should enquire into the details of the proposed station at Cyprus in order to satisfy uhe cabinet that the station would prove adequate for its intended purpose from the point of view both of technical efficiency and the programmes to be broadcast, and other matters related thereto such as Departmental responsibility and local ^ organisation. y\ The Secretary of State may care to see the file on this subject with the summary note on the top.

Broadcasting of anti-British propaganda in the Near and Middle East. Copy of to FOR INFORMATION. The question of countering anti- British propaganda broadcast in the Near and Middle East has been under discussion for some time. The F.O. have shown great interest in the matter, and our officers in the Persian Gulf have also independently suggested the desirability of British broadcasts in Arabic (see Col. Fowle’s letters flagged C and D on the file). The discussions were at first directed- towards the possibility of utilising the B.B.C., but this idea has now been relinquished since, as will be seen from Mr. Eden's memorandum, what is required is medium*wave broadcasting. The question of anti-British propaganda was further discussed at a meeting of the Middle 6089 Wtl076 ° /lM2 1000 5 H7 Tnp East Sub-Committee on Tuesday, June 8 th, when a despatch/i despatch from Sir Reader Ballard, tiimster at Jedda, dated April 7th, 1937 (flagged E) was considered. Sir Reader Bullard gave it as his view that the only possible form of counter-propaganda was by wireless. The Middle East Sab- Committee agreed to take note of the information pat before them by the foreign Office and Colonial Office representatives. 'Vith regard to the sapply of material for press distnbation and the development of British caltaral activities it was recommended that action shoald eontinae on the present lines. It is anderstood that the matter is now to come up for discussion in the Cabinet. It is proposed that certain important measures shoald be taken for the purpose of counteracting the anti-British news broadcast from the Italian wireless station at Bari. The proposals are that a special officer, with firsthand experience of the Arab mentality, shoald be attached to the News Department of the ^.0. with the duty: 1 . Of following the output of any anti-British wireless propaganda in the Near and Middle East. 2. Of collecting or receiving from other Govt. Depts. any items of news to which it is desirable to give wide publicity, and 3. Drafting in the form of news bulletins any such information or announcements designed to counteract foreign propaganda, these bulletins being then telegraphed to Palestine, translated into Arabic and broadcast. As a further step, the Cabinet will be asked to sanction the construction of a medium-wave station in Cyprus. The advantage of this will be that a station in Cyprus would be free from the restrictions which attach to the use of a station (such as Jerusalem) situated in ^ mandated territory, which cannot be regarded as primarily designed for the service of British interests, r 1 rom thi^ static 7Minute Paper.

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign A ffairs. FOR some time past the interests and the reputation of this country in the Near and Middle East have suffered from the lack of any suitable broadcasting agency in that area. The popularity of the wireless has been growing rapidly, and although the number of private listeners may still be small, there has been a great increase in the number of loud-speakers set up in the cafes which in every town and village are the centres for the exchange of news. Our political rivals have not been slow in taking advantage of this new propaganda medium; in particular, the Italian wireless station at Bari has, during the last few years, made a practice of broadcasting in Arabic news and views favourable to the Italian cause. The Bari programme ranges from recognisable, but strongly biased, accounts of recent events, and declarations of Italy’s sympathy with the Moslem world, to poisonous and violent anti-British fabrications. Examples of these last are numerous and need not be quoted here; several have lately been cited in the press. From time to time representations have been made to the Italian Govern ment and the tone of Bari has for a while improved; little, however, has been done to ensure a positive presentation of the British point of view to the Arabs by means of the wireless, the only propaganda of this kind being the use made of the British Broadcasting Corporation’s Empire news bulletins and of Reuter’s news service by the Palestine broadcasting station, and the occasional exercise of influence on the Egyptian broadcasting station at Cairo. Meanwhile, enquiry shows that the Italian broadcasts, even if they are not taken at their face value and occasionally even excite ridicule by their exaggerations, do by their very persistence end by creating, if not a feeling in favour of Italy, at least a prejudice against Great Britain. The time has now come when some more positive step should be taken than that of asking the Italians to desist. Without attempting to imitate the tone or the methods of Bari, it is essential for His Majesty’s Government to ensure the full and forcible presentation of the British view of events in a region of such vital imperial importance. The Foreign Office have, therefore, discussed this matter in detail with the Colonial Office and the British Broadcasting Corpora tion, and have reached the following conclusions :— To reach the great mass of Arab listeners, any broadcast must be delivered in Arabic and on a medium wave, since it goes without saying that very few of the hearers uriderstandMmgTIsh and the wireless sets employed by the cafes cannot for the most fart receive direct the high-power emissions from London or Daventry : Bari is itself a medium-wave station and medium-wave receiving sets are much cheaper and easier to work than the short-wave set which would be necessary to listen-in direct to London. The only two medium-wave stations in the Near and Middle East are Jerusalem and Cairo, and of these only Jerusalem can be counted upon for the purpose in view, as any attempt to exert a continuous influence over the Cairo station would meet with resistance. The only immediate step which can be taken is, in consequence, to ensure that any information which 9381 [15578]2 it is desired to make public is broadcast from Jerusalem. The Jerusalem station already runs a news service and, as mentioned above, makes use of the Empire news bulletins of the British Broadcasting Corporation : it also uses Reuter. Neither of these news services is entirely satisfactory from the present point of view : it is not in any case the specific duty of either of them to keep track of foreign propaganda with a view to contradicting it. The British Broadcasting Corporation would no doubt be willing to insert in the trans mission which includes the Near Eastern countries additional news items supplied from Governmental sources; since, however, any such items would in any case have to be translated and re-broadcast in Jerusalem, there seems no necessity to enlist their help. A more expeditious procedure would be the following. A special officer with first-hand experience of Arab mentality would be attached to the News Department of the Foreign Office, with the duty, first, of following the output of any anti-British wireless propaganda in the Near and Middle East; secondly, of collecting, or receiving from other Government Depart ments, any items of news to which from the British point of view it is desirable to give a wide circulation in that area; and thirdly, of drafting in news bulletin form any such information or any announcements designed to counteract foreign propaganda. The bulletins so produced would be telegraphed to Palestine, where they would be translated into Arabic and broadcast, though not necessarily in the exact form in which they were sent. This, as has been said, is, in existing circumstances, the only action which can be taken to counter foreign wireless propaganda, and the approval of the Cabinet is sought for its immediate adoption. The total cost involved would probably be small, involving salaries for a staff of two in London and possibly one extra man in Jerusalerm and the cost of the messages themselves whether sent by cable or wireless. Ifn one respect, however, this proposal represents an unsatisfactory compromise. Jerusalem is, and, so far as can be seen, is likely to remain, in mandated territory and for that reason it will never be possible to make the fullest use of the broadcasting station there. What is required is a medium-wave station under British control, that is to say on British territory, which, besides relaying the Daventry programmes, could give programmes of its own in Arabic or any other foreign language. The most suitable site for such a station would undoubtedly be Cyprus, from which all parts of the Levant and the Near and Middle East could be easily reached. From the imperial point of view such a station would be of the greatest use not only in the Arabic-speaking countries but in Cyprus itself and the Greek speaking countries as well, including in the latter Egypt with its large Greek population. It is worth mentioning in this connexion that a large German-built station is soon to be erected at Athens and it may be desirable that this should not be the only centre of attraction for Cypriot listeners. The construction of a station in Cyprus would free British broadcasting in this area from the restrictions which attach to the use of a station in mandated territory and consequently one which cannot be regarded as primarily designed for the service of British interests; it would make available to a very much larger audience the present programmes of the British Broadcasting Corporation, including the broadcasts of great events in British national life; it ought also to provide for the inhabitants of the various countries served programmes of local interest such as they at present can only receive, if at all, from sources indifferent, or opposed, to British needs; finally, it would afford a standing guarantee that in this, as in other spheres, we would not in future allow any unfriendly Power to attack us with impunity. The total cost of erecting such a station is estimated at not more than £50,000 and the period of erection at approximately nine months. Both capital and maintenance costs would, it is felt, have to be borne mainly by the Home Exchequer, as contributions from Cyprus would be negligible in amount. The approval of the Cabinet is also sought for this further measure in principle and subject to examination by the Departments concerned of the technical and other details involved. July 13, 1937. A.
