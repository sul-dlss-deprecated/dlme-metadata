D.0.;’o:C/_C?_ 2 .• oli ciciJL .v;sncy, ]jalirain,the 28th June 1132* Dear Belgrave, Please refer to letter No:453/3DG dated the 26th Jaiaad-i-Awal 1350 sent by Parke to this Agency vfcen he *^as acting; for you last summer. Before sending the matter on to Bushire I would be glad to know what you think about it as you have to find the extra money involved by the concession, iy personal view is that since do Grenier already receives more pay than you it will be out of place to grant him any further concessions. However,the last time he went on leave he was not due fares from Government and the Shaikh,! believe paid him Gs*i,0GG/- towards his ticket,so that the extra cost to Government in the long run would not be great. Yours Sincerely, .D. 3 e Igrave , s&lt; ui re, dviser to the Bahrain Government, ahrain.With reference to letter no 453/D.G. written to you hy Parke on 26th Jumad al Awal 1350, v/hile I was on leave last Summer, in which he says that he certainly considers that de Grenier should have the same privileges as regards annual leave as himself and myself; I am not in agreement with Parke’s opinion. de Grenier’s Contract differs from mine considerably. In the matter of leave pay it is the same but he is entitled to no passages whatever except on taking up the appointment and on i ina.lly terminating it. I on the other hand am entitled to two return passages to to the U.K. after conupleting four years service, one for myself and one for my wife provided that she d oes- the journey. Also I am entitled to one return passage to India every sfflS- year. v^eGsas&amp;Bm. These passages amount to about Rs 1100 per annum which is just about the amount by which de Grenier’s pay exceeds mine, therefore under present conditions our pay, consolidated, is about the same. I think it not unreasona,ble for me to point out that it would be unsuitable that de Grenier should be recitving considerably higher pay than I recieve which would be the case if his passage terms were made to correspond to those in my Contract, which I understand is what he wants. It is true that he has been here longer than me but both our Contracts were made out by Daly and until de Grenier was acquainted ' with the terms in my Contract he was apparently quite satisfied with his own. I suggest that Daly made out my Contract with more liberal passage conditions in order that there should not be so much difference in my consolidated pay and de Grenierb* This is my personal point of view; as regards the State I do not feel that it is a time to make any concessions of this nature owing to the financial position. It is true that Shaikh Hamed allowed de Grenier itelOOO towards his passages last time he went on leave but this was a specialinstance and can not possibly be taken as a precedent. Financial conditions were very much-better then than they are now. at f I have no wish to be disparaging to de Grenier but I think that his pay and leave conditions at present are very suitable for the position which he now holds in this Government. 1 l r '1 Confidential , D.O.No.503-3 of 1932, The Residency, Bushire, the 16th July 19 32, rvor U Will you please refer to your demi-official letter ho.C/l2&lt;5of the 10th July 1932 regarding de Grenier’s contract, p^ I agree with the view which you have expressed that de Grenier is adequately remunerated already and that it is undesirable to give him terms which would actually make him better off than Belgrave, His responsibilities are obviously not as great as those of Belgrave, Further, the present is n particularly in- opportune moment at which to authorise any additional expenditure, p ^ Would you kindly communicate the gist of the above remarks to de .Grenier and say that I regret that I am not prepared to support any modification of his contract which would involve additional expenditure to the State, Copt.

It will probably be necessary to discuss details regarding customs arrangements and it would be of value to me to have the help of one who is familiar with practical customs work in the Gulf. 3. If you see no objection, would you kindly ask Mr. de Grenier if he would be prepared to come over to Kuwait for a few days. It would mean coming to Kuwait by the Westbound aeroplane on the 20th September and probably returning by the Slow Mail leaving Kuwait on the 24th or 25th September. I could arrange to find him a sum equivalent to travelling allowance and halting allowance at our rates for a first class officer and Watts will I am sure gladly put him up. 4. If you have no objection and if Mr-de Grenier is prepared to help me in this way, please explain the position to Shaikh Hamad and ask him if he would be kind enough to let Mr. de Grenier have a few days leave of absence for this purpose. 5.

BAHPJIOT: 19th October, 1941 May I invite your interest in a point that has remained outstanding unsettled for a number of years, in connection with my Agreement for service of his Highness, which commenced in January, 19E4, my Agreement being the first one that was made. Since that date other European officials have been appoint^; and I believe that I am correct in stating that each of such officials is granted every year one return passage to India, and every four years (or on completion of service) a return first-class passage to the United Kingdom, or the equivalent value thereof in case the incumbent wishes to travel by his own route. My Agreement did not contain that much appreciated grant; and in 1930 1 raised that question with the Poiitical Agent, Captain C.G.Prior,who considered it favourably „ the grant was taken by the Adviser on the ground that I ^ as drawing a larger salary than himself, which was true. This P° s ^ has, however, long since been changed; and the Adviser, of cou , draws a much larger pay than myself, and quite justifiably. I consulted the late Political Agent, Mr Hugh Weightman, on the advisability of asking His Highness fo** a grant of annual passages etc., which would put me on an equal footing^with all the other European officials; and he approved of my apphying to the Bahrain Government for same, which I did verbally to the Adviser, who promised to consider it, and, I suppose, is still considering it. Since then, years have elapsed; and I trust that it is not unsuitable for me to raise the question again, in the hope that this anomaly may be suitably adjusted after so many years. Believe me, Yours Y. sincerely, 75 Tot- Major R.G.E.W.Alban, O.B.E., I.A., H.B.M 1 s Political Agent, BAHRAIN. \ H _£j, h • //..■ v I I lh' ’ ' ' L '7'• S Si %Mr# de Grenier came to see roe today and mentioned two points# x X X X 2* '-Hie second point was the tiuestion of his Jubilee and Coronation Medals# he told roe tiat when he had been at horoe in 1935 Sir Gilbex't Laithwaite, who was then at the India (fiice, had told him that he would find his Jubilee Medal waiting for him on his return# When he c&amp;roe out here he found, however, that one had not been allotted to him as Colonel Loch had directed from bushire that the extra medal should be given to the Acting Political Agent, Captain ^ole# He had strongly hoped in 1937 that he would be awarded the Coronation Medal, but was again disappointed when the distribution was raade leaving him out# He enquired whether it would be possible to award him either of the medals retros pectively. I told him that so far as I knew the lists were closed at a fixed date axd after the medals had been distributed and that it would he quite impossible to take up the matter after this lapse of time# Mr# de Grenier then observed that he must reconcile himself to his disappointment, with which 1 agreed. id.

C/184 han T was recently in ^uehire I apoke to you about Mr. de Grenier. The relevant part of clause 14 of his Agree ment with the Bahrain Government is as follows s- »This agreement shall continue in force until it is (ii) upon the Director reaching 56 years of age# Provided that an extension up to 60 years may be gran tod on production ol a certificate of fitness for further service from the Besidency Surgeon at Bushire.** Mr. de Grenier was bom in September 1887 and his contract therefore expired several months ago. 2m Belgrave has discussed the situation at great length with Shaikh Salman who agrees that it is most desirable th&lt;st Mr. de Grenier should be replaced as soon as possible. The Shaikh was anxious about two points only - &lt;D th^t no dis credit should attach to him for discharging a# Juropean employee and (2) that no handle should be given to anti- British elements in the Island to make capital out of Mr. de Grenier’s discharge. Apart from M anti-British element^ merchants in Bahrain have been unanimous for some months in blaming all their troubles on Mr. de 'venier and the Shaikh does not want them to feel that it is their complaints which have led to Mr. de Grenier’s retirement from the local terminated (i) by either party giving to the other three months* previous notice in writing, or P scene. The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel 7 C. G. Prior, C. I. K., Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushlre.^''ll l L ,ft«^8l l ^' ( z t': - 2 - 3* In regard to a successor to Mr. de Grenier, the Shaikh does not want to have an Indian and is strongly in favour of employing a# European, preferably British. The incumbent of the post should, the Shaikh says, be active and conversant with Arabic• 4. Mr. de Grenier is at present on leave in Iraq and Belgrave is trying tc get in touch with him. He is, however, due back here at any time. Belgrave will break the news tactfully to him and possibly Mi*, de Grenier will take the initiative in asking to be relieved on grounds of health. I do not think there will be any awkwardness unless Mr. de Grenier secures a certificate of fitness for further service from the Residency Surgeon at Buahire, in which case Belgrave or I will have to be more blunt with him. 5. I have discussed tentatively with Ward Anderson the possibility of borrowing some one from Bapco, He is willing to lend us Mr. Thompson Taggett but I do not think (and Howes agrees with me) that this-would be a very suitable choice. Though Mr. Thompson Taggett would be an improvement on Mr. de Grenier I think we should aim rather highly The problems of trade and food control are complex and constitute the most important issue with which Bahrain is confronted at present or is likely to be confronted during the coming months. The only really suitable man that Belgrave or I can think of is Mr* Smith, the employee of Messrs. Gray Mackenzie at Basra, fhen I mentioned his name to you at Bushire you thought that we should not make an approach to him as he was at present fulfilling functions at Basra which are of importance in relation to the war. I do not know exactly what Mr. Smith*s duties are but I believe a number of men with shipping experience /-jjQggMMMMMW 3 experience have been releases from the Par East and this factor should render it easier for Gray Mackenzies to replace him, if it were possible to secure him for Bahrain. 6. I will make further enquiries from Bapco (without committing the Bahrain Government or myself to anything definite) and I should be most grateful if you would make enquiries from Basra. If you are not willing that Mr. Smith should be approached there may perhaps be some one reliable from the Port Trust who would be willing to come to Bahrain.
