With reference to paragraph 9 of my letter No.721 dated the 21st September 1931# I have the honour to inform you that ever since 1921 the annual rental of the house occupied by the Medical Officer attached to thAs Agency, has had to be met from the Office Allowance of this Agency. This is more or less explained in correspondence ending with Residency letter No.1361 dated the 20th lune 1927 to the Political Agent, Kuwait. ^ ■ - v 2# The Office Allowance of this Agency has recently been drastically reduced for reasons which need not be discussed here, and I find in consequence that it will be well nigh impossible for me to continue to bear the annual charge of Ks^OO/- which is the rent / that has hitherto been paid for the Medical Officer f s house in Kuwait. 3. I*on a study of the past records on the subjects, which I confess are somewhat obscure, it is not quite clear why a House Allowance was not granted to the Medical Officer when this Agency was first established, that this was not done should not now I think be used as an argument against rectifying the error, especially it I believe/to be a fact that every other Assistant Surgeon in the Persian Gulf without exception is provided either with a house-2- @) ® ll houso Allowance varying from 40/- to 60/- per month, or is provided with a Crovornment Building to accommodate himself and his family in. 4. I therefore would earnestly request that this question be favourably considered by you, and if it meets with your approval, that the Government of India be moved to grant an annual lump sum allowance of RsiOO/- to the Medical Officer, Kuwait as a House Rent Allowance with effect from 1 st April 1932. Such a grant will not only be an act of ordinary Justice but will bring signal relief to my much reduced Office Allowance. I have the honour to be.

New I 'uw ait Agency. • • • (1) Colonel Fowle has suggested that When Dickson moves to New Agency, Greenway moves into present Agency, which is and wil be rent free, as it was given as a gift to His Najesty’s Govern ment by Uubarak. {2) The present Agency is fully wired for Electricity. I (3) Dickson wants following urgent action taken: (a) Hiring of New Agency, which he sent in with details more than 6 months ago. (b) The question urgently settled as to what electricity system is to be given for New Agency. (c) Question of mast for New Agency. (d) Furniture for New Agency (Drawing and Dining room ordered in England). (4) Present II.(U s house is in good condition though very small. It is wired and has had four fans given him by Government and put in at Government expense. House has been gauze wired by Dickson* s unofficial funds. Rent is not paid by Government, but by Dickson from rent Rs. 30/- which he receives frail D. G. Iraq Posts and Telegraphs for Post Office quarters,\which he arrang ed for them. This rent is paid annually in advance from June, therefore there is about 8 months lease in hand. The 4 fans given to Greenway, will be useless for Greenway if he moves to old agency, since the idea is to join the old'Agency to Town Supply which has a higher voltage. These four fans however are worked frcm the old Agency electric plant and if this plant is transferred to New Agency then the only house where these fans can be used will be in that building. The Head Clerk when he moves into Greenway* s house can take the table fan which he has with him,as annexe is on Town 3upp;y. If t- erefore when I move to New Agency, Greenway comes into Old Agency and Head Clerk to Greenway*s house, new fans will be required for Agency, which will be on Town Supply and for Greenway*s present House. Colonel Fowle to the best of his recollection has recom mended that Government give 2 overhead fans for old Apenc' r2 ® &amp;&gt; u for Greenway * s use. As hov/ever Green’.my had four fans sanctioned by Government for use in his present house, Govern ment might be asked to give 4 instead of two. (5) If Greenway moves into Old Agency, I propose putting Eead Clerk into Greenway’s house, and putting Postmaster into Head Clerk’s present house and raising rent from Iraq Govern ment by la. 10/-. (6) The Head Clerk’s house with Dispensary and Post Office and iiedi cal Stores Room is known as the Agency Annexe. The whole annexe has been wired and given the following fans by me partly from my -own unofficial funds, and partly with assistance of Shaikh. The fans consist of Head Clerk. 1 table fan. Dispensary. 2 table fans. Post Office. 1 overhead fan. The annexe has been wire-gauzed by Government. (7) . Rent of the annexe is Hi. 50/- per mensem. This has been paid from Office Allowance since a Political Agent has been in Kuwa it. (8) . If Head Clerk goes into Greenway’s House then there will remain in annexe Postmaster and family in Head Clerk’s house, (also using his present quarters which are very snail) the Dispensary and liedi cal Store Room. (9) . Colonel Fowle suggests that perhaps Annexe should be given up altogether, and that the Dispensary and Medical Stores and Iraq Post Office be moved to present Office quarters of Old Agency. It will be convenient for Greenway to have his Dis- pe»hsary. There is a large courtyard at back to which there is separate entrance. (10) . Colonel Fowle thinks that if there are political objections to having the Iraq Post Offioe in the house of a British Official, i.e., the Medical Officer the Iraq Postal. authorities could be asked to make their own arrangements, i.e., remain in their own present quarters in Annexe. (11) . If the Annexe is given up entirely, the rent, i.e. Rs. 50 which I pay at present, will be saved, and could be used to meet rent of Head Clerk’s new, i.e., Greenway’s5 ^rese-.t house. (12). Greenway says that it will suit him very well to have his Dispensary in the corner of the present Agency courtyard. NOTE . If Government agrees to new Agency going on Town Supply they, Government, would lose (a) Es. 3000 (approx.) which is sum for which Kuwait Electric Co., will wire light and give fans for New Agency provided that fans of old Agency and of Greenway’s present house are handed over to them. (b) Difference in sale price of old Agency Plant and what Government gave for it 3 or 4 years ago. (a) Rs. 1400 (approx) per annum i.e. difference bet ween cost of maintenance of present plant (Rs. 2000 approx) and Office electricity bill for New Agency (i.e. approx. Rs. 600/-).

DICKSON, Lt.-Col Political Agent, Kuwait Kuwait, the 20th October 1934Extract of an Express Letter No. 2480 « dated the 4th 53Z2l~ November 1934, from the Hon'hle the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, to the Foreign and Political Department, New Delhi. (a) The Head Clerk has quarters in a 'building which is shared hy the ’Iraq. Post Office and the Medical Officer's Dispensary and Medical Store Room. For this 'building Rs. 50/- per mensem, as sanctioned 'by the Govern ment of India for the quarters of the Head Clerk and the Medical Officer, is paid. The 'Ifaq Post Office pay for their share of this 'building Rs. 30/- per mensem, and this sum is paid for the rent of the Medical Officer's present house. ('b) This query is dealt with under my reply to (a). (c) (i) The reasons for shifting the officials in question from their existing quarters are as follows;- The house at present occupied hy the Medical Officer, though adequate, is considerably smaller than the present Agency - which I will refer to in future as the Old Agency, and the Medical Officer will 'be considerably more comfortable in it. It is quite true, as pointed out in paragraph 3 of your letter under reference, that the old Agency - as reported is June and July 1929 - was in a very bad condition. Since then, however, the sum of Ruppes 1800/- has been spent on it - vide Government of India telegram No. 771 of the 13th November 1929. The condition of the old Agency has therefore been improved. Moreover as the old Agency was a gift from Shaikh Mubarak, no rent is now paid for it, and no rent will be paid as long as it is occupied by an official of the Government of India. If, however, it is given up and remains untenanted then the Government of India will lose their claim and the present Shaikh will doubtless reclaim it. Should the Medical Officer- 2 - Officer 'be shifted to the old Agency, Government of India will have the use of this house rent-free. Moreover, I propose that the Medical Officer's Dispensary and his Store Room he housed in certain rooms in the courtyard which is attached to the old Agency, This would he conveinet for the Medical Officer, and Government would thus get free of rent, a commodious huilding for the Medical Officer himself, his Dispensary and his Store Room. (ii) The reasons for shifting the Head Clerk to the Medical Officer's present house are that this house is more commodious that the quarters at present occupied hy him, and the sum of Rs. 50/- per memse,. sanctioned hy Government from the Political Agent's Office Allowance, will cover the rent of tie Head Clerk's new house, i e. Medical Officer's present house. (iii) With reference to your paragraph 3 the points raised have heen met in my paragraph 2 above. To sum up. By my proposal the Medical Officer and Head Clerk will he more commodiously accommodated without Rst any further cost to Governemtn thati the/50/- sanctioned for the quarters of these two officials. So much for the subject of the quarters. To turn to the question of Electricity. (Orig. on file 4/14. page 120.)To ■t POLITICAL AG.^CY, LU^IT.

My reply is as follows (a) The old agency in 1929 was in ban condition while occupied Dy CgIcagI ««uOa. 3 and whan first I took over. *New spare room up stairs and Necessary ’’specini” repairs ana ^additions, however, v/ere effected, which resulted in the house being brou^i t into very good condition ana which has been maintained to date. (b) In its present state it is a most suitable residence 2 guest -—^or the Medical Officer, being near the harbour and 90^ superior to the ^auc/ 1 house he is occupying (actually, so well were the repairs done to the old Agency, that today it stands out as the fourth best house in KuwaitJ 3. Government of India state that the reasons put forward by you in your Sxprecs Letter Ho.2480 , dated 4.11.34, 55721 are not oonsicerad sufficient 'to justify additional expenditure' on the houses of Medical Officer and Head Clerk. This is not understood as it was pointed out by you that the rent paid for Hoad Clerk’s present house, Rs.50/- p.m. (less Rs.30/- p.m. receiver from Post Office) would cover the rent of the Head Cleric’s new house (i.e. Jvleoicali.e.Medical Officers present house) and that if the Medical Officer moved to the old Agency, he would be occupying a ‘’rent free” building (a gift from the shaikh 25 years ago) thereby saving Government the rent of the Medical Officers house. NOTE. In this connection, I would point out that my Office Allowance assisted by the Rs.30/- paid by Post Office, has hither to paid the rent of the Medical Officer’s house under past orders from Bushire, but 1 would like to say that the Medical Officer is entitled to * either a free house or in lieu Rs.CO/- p.m. house rent (Rs*720 per annum)# The Post Office have now intimated, however, that from the 1st April 19 35, they will rent a new building nearer the New Agency. This will mean that my Office Allowance will have to meet the whole rent of the Medical Officer’s house which it cannot do, and Government will have to meet the whole amount. 4. Government of India state that 'they are apprehensive that the retention of the old Agency will result in future deirands for expenditure on repairs greatly in excess of the present annual expenditure on maintenance”* - I fail to see why Government, should be apprehensive that any excess over the sanctioned Rs.800/- will be needed, when it has been pointed^that the building (old Agency) is in such good condition as to justify my saying that it is the xourth best building in Kuwait today. 5. To sum up:- Under Government’s scheme if (a) The M.O. and (b) H.G. remain in their present houses rent will be (a) SO/- p.m. = Rs*600. (b) 50/- p.m. «• Rs.600. Rg.1200. while under your scheme (a) No r ent. (b) 50/- = Rs.600. (c) Maintenance of Old Agency- Rs.600/- 3,1200/-UQ1;: The Head ulerk’s present house is rented from the Shaikh, but repairs (under original agreement) have been done out of the Hs*800/- allowed for maintaining the old Agency. If the H.G. moves to the M.O’s present house *{s.600/- will be ample for maintaining the old Agency. But if the Government’s scheme is adopted I shall have to ask that the M.O. be supplied with Bs#60/- house rent p.m. (720 p.m.), as I shall no longer be able to find it from my Office Allowance when the Post Office ceases to pay me rent (See note to para 3 above). 6. It will be seen therefore that under your scheme, not only will the M.0 and H.U. have far more ’healthy” and 'suitable' houses given them than they now occupy, but Government will be s ved an annual recurring charge of Rs.720/- Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait.DRAFT EX?. From Political Resident, Bushire To Foreign, New Delhi• Repeated Secretary of State for India, London. No. 284 of February 4th, 1935. 1. Rs.1300/- is given as annual expenditure on Old Agency. This should be Rs.BOO/-* 2. Government of India state that Old Agency in extremely bad condition and unfit for European habitation. Please see ray express letter No.2480/53/21, dated 4th November paragaph 2 (c) (i) in which I pointed out the good condition of the building 3. The government of India state that my reasons given in ray previous letter are not sufficient ’’to justify additional expenditure rt on houses of Medical Officer and Head Clerk. I pointed out that the rent Rs.50/- paid for Head Clerk* s house (less Rs.30/- p.m. paid bi Post Office) would cover rent of Head Clerk’s m house (i.e. Medical Officer’s present house and that if Medical Officer moved into Old Agency he would be in a rent free house, thereby saving the rent of Medical Officer’s house. Since th&lt; the Post Office have intimated that from 1st April this year they will rent another building nearer the New Agency which will mean a discon tinuance of their payment of Rs.30/- leaving No Dated March 1935. Reference Government of India’s telegram Government- 2 - 6 Government to find the whole amount Rs.50/- p.m. for Medical Officer’s house. In this connection I would p0int out that the Medical Officeris due from Government a free house or Rs.60/- p.m. house rent. This rent has hitherto been met by the Political Agent, Kuwait, out of his office allowance# It has been a strain and now the additional amount would make matters worse# 4. Government of India state that they /ui are apprehensive ^ tother demands greatly in excess of the present annual expenditure maintenance ,, f will result# 1 can definitely s tate that Government need not be apprehensive that any excess ove the sanctioned amount of Rs.QOO/- will be needed since the house^ as I have already stated, is in good condition. 5# To sum up*- Under Government’s scheme, if (a) the Medical Officer and (b) the Head Clerk remain in their present houses, rent will be (a) Rs•50/- p.m# - Rs.600/-p.a, - (b) Rs.50/- p.m. - Rs.600/-p.a. Total Rs.1200/-p. a. while under my proposal (a) No rent (b) Rs#50/- p.m. - Rs.600/-p.a# (c) Maintenance of Old Agency Rs600/-p. Total Rs #1200/-p. i * Ha .200/- has been deducted as out of the original Rs.800/-, Head Clerk’s house was maintained as well.sJI'J I - 3 - 6. No extra cost to Government is ijvolved in my proposal, both Medical Officer and Head Clerk will be better housed than they are at resent and I trust therefore Govern ment will see fit to reconsider decision and sanction my recommendation.

The grant and the acceptance of a lease cannot he effected so guick as light ning, especially when the lessor lives in one country and the lessee in another. The question being one of giving and accepting of a lease, and it being necessary after all that communications be made with me directly, therefore negotiations should proceed on a clear basis. Hence it has become necessary to enquire about the following points : - How long would be the duration of the lease? Does the lessor need the house for his personal residence; or for an official department; or for a commercial department; or for all? Is the electrification and the cost thereof to be born by the lessor or by ourselves? On the supposition that the cost is to be bom by us, what will it be, and of what quality should be the electrical impliments? The lessor shall not be entitled to transfer the lease to another. I cannot mak:e a draft of the lease and send it for perusal before the lapse of the first week of Shauwal month, 1354. (6) If, God forbid, a difference arises between the lessor and the lessee and the latter cannot come to an understanding with the former and the question is referred to the esteemed judicature, the case should be looked into at the Courts of Basra, on the consideration that Basra is the residence of both parties. But if the other party desire to occupy the house rent-free, it is not far (beyond their reach), in view of all regard and kind favours always extended to me. I am always grateful.

Memorandum Ho . D. 4530-V35. Dated New Delhi, the December 1935. House Rent Allowance for the Medical Officer, Kuwait. Reference correspondence ending with your memorandum Ho. 2381, dated the 17th November 1935. 2. It appears from the above correspondence and your express letter No.2480/5V^l, dated the 4th November 1934, that a rent of Rs. 50/- per mensem is being paid, apparently out of the Office Allowance grant for the Kuwait Agency for the building engaged for the Medical Officer*s dispensary and store room and quarters of the Head Clerk. Part of this building was occupied by the Iraq Post Office and the rent of Hs. 30/- per mensem received on this account was utilised towards the rent of the Medical Officer* s quarters, the balance being met from the Office Allowance grant. Practically, therefore, the entire rent of the Medical Officer*s quarters has so far been met fro-m the Office Allowance grant, and the Government of India are not satisfied that it is necessary to change the existing practice and grant a house rent allowance to the Medical Officer. It may be mentioned, in this connection, that the Kuwait Office Allowance grant originally sanctioned included a sum of Ks. 800/- under 'Contingencies* for rents, rates and taxes. The giant has/ has subsequent!/ been reduced to Ks # 6,870/-, but the reduction was aue to alterations in the establishment, and apparently no reduction was made under ’•Contingencies’ 1 , 3. In your memorandum of the 17th November 1935, it has been stated that the building inown as the Agency annexe, hitherto occupied by the Iraq Post Office, has been handed back to its owner. This presumably refers only to the portion, occupied by the Iraq Post Office, of the building rented as Head Clerks quarters and the Medical Officer’s dispensary and store room. Vide paragraph 2 (a) of your express letter dated the 4th November 1934. If so, it should no longer be necessary to continue to pay the full rent of Ks.50/- per mensem for this building and the saving in rent resulting therefrom may be utilised to meet part of the cost of the Medical Officer’s quarters, the balance being met as before from the Office Allowance grant. If, however, you consider that it is no longer possible to meet the rent of the Medical Officer’s quarters from the Office Allowance grant, proposals for the necessary increase in the grant may be forwarded with full reasons why the present grant of Hs. 6,870/- is found insufficient to cover the charges intended to be met from the grant.

Political Agency, Kuwait, 28tin August, 1944 TO The Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Oulf, Bushire. Sir, .14 I h£ve the honour to invite a reference to my predecessor’s letter No.692-4/13 dated the 5th June on the subject of a house for the Agency Assistant Surgeon and Quarantine Medical Officer in Kuwait, and to say that for the last eight years the Assistant Surgeon has lived in a house built for him by one Mohammed Thunniyan, a merchant of Kuwait, and rented by the Agency on a verbal agreement years, but has recently returned to settle. He now requires the house for his own residence, and has given the Assistant Surgeon notice to vacate the house by 31st March, 1945. All attempts to induce the landlord to reconsider his decision have failed. 3. Since the notice was received one Political Aguit and the Assistant Surgeon have been exercised trying to find another house for the latter; but, up to the time of writing, no house that is remotely suitable or that could be made suitable without entire rebuilding and refitting has been found. Indeed, with the exception of those houses already occupied by the European and American communities here - all of which were either built or altered especially for them -, there are no houses in Kuwait which are suitable for European habitation without considerable structural alteration and fitting out. Moreover, in the acute housing shortage at present prevailing in Kuwait, there are no liouses available which are suitable for alteration. 4. If they are to retain an Assistant Surgeon in Kuwait, therefore, there would appear to be two alternatives open to the Government of India; either they must themselves build a house for the Assistant Surgeon, or someone must be found to build one for lease to him. In either case it will be nece sary for the Government of India to make available from India or the United Kingdom the necessary cement; iron girders; wood; door and window frames; glass; water tanxs and piping; bath room fittings; electrical wiring, fittings, lights, and fans; nails, screws, hinges, and locks; wire gauze; and paint. 5. Preliminary enquiries show that it is improbable that anyone but Pis Highness the Shaikh will be able or willing to make available a suitable site, or to build a suitable house for the Assistant Sur eon. If His Highness proves willing to provide a site and to build a house, he will almost certainly require the Government of India to supply the necessary imported materials at their expense, although he may be willing to pay for them in whole or in part through an adjustment in the annual rental. Such has been the prociice in respect of certain houses previously constructed by His Highness for the employees of British Companies here.' 6. It is fully appreciated that the present is not the most opportune time to build houses. Perusal of Colonel Moore’s letter No.384/4/7 of the 12th July, 1924, however, of which a copy is enclosed, will show that this is no new problem; and, unless the Assistant Surgeon is to be made the victim of it, it w r ould appear that the Government o'f India cannot escape reaping the results of their neglect in the past. Had they chosen to build at any time within the past twenty years the Government of India would not now be at the mercy of a landlord. Whatever the views of the Goverm ent for a rental to Ra. 1200/- pex- aimum annum which has recently been increased 2 Mohammed Thunniyan was absent from Kuwait for a number of of/2 of India may be, it is unlikely that the Assistant Surgeon will consent to being made the victim of past neglect; for, unless e suitable residence is made available, he will, in all probability, elect to return to military duty, 7, In the circumstances I shall be glad to hear whether the Government of India intend to build a house themselves, or whether I should approach His Highness in the matter, 8, An early decision will be appreciated because it will taxte time to find a suitable site, to prepare plans, to build the house, and to secure the necessary fittings from India and the United Kingdom, The house at present occupied will be available for a further ?i months only.

My reply to your letter No.2570 is held up because the Kuwait Electric Company are at present actively considering changing over from D.C. to A.C. current as soon after the war as possible, and your question (d) cannot be answered until their decision is known. I expect a decision to be reached on the arrival of an adviser from Abadan early in January. Alos, I consider that a part of the Assistant Surgeon f s house should be air conditioned, and cannot give a comprehensive reply until the plan for his house is ready. 3. The plan for the Surgeon’s house is in turn affected and held up by the question of who is to pay for the current fey:* air conditioning plants. Will the cost of electricity be a hot-weather charge on (Government, or will it be debitable to those using air conditioners? Hynes considers that the high cost of electricity in Kuwait precludes information or views you may have on this latter point. I can then complete my proposals for the Assistant Surgeon’s house and can co-ordinate them with those for air conditioning. his paying for air conditioning himsif. 4.

M f s Political Agent(fc|) /i/ NOTE ON MR. THANAIYAN BIN THANAIYAN AL GHANIM’S HOUSE AND THE RENT HE HAS ASKED THE K.O.C. TO PAY IN 1945, IF THEY WERE INTERESTED. 1* The house in question built in Arab style with central courtyard was occupied by Mr. Campbell of the K.O.C. and subsequently by Mr. Walker for some 2 years and then was used as K.O.C. Medical Ward for just over a year till the closing down of the Conpany^ operations in 19A2« It was then taken over by the R.A.P. and used as a Rest House till autumn 1944« 2. The rent which the Company used to pay the landlord when the house was occupied by the Company was Rs. 665 /- per annum, and the Company put in all its own fittings such as bath, lavatory, running water tanks on roof, electric lights and fans and an air conditioner, as there were no amenities at all in it on taking over. 3* When the R.A.F. occupied the house the Company allowed them the use of the above fittings etc. until they gave up the house this autumn (1944)* Then the K.O.C. removed all its fittings as had been arranged with R.A.F. and the landlord previously. 4. The Company recently enquired from the landlord if he would be willing to rent his house again to the K. .C. as from 1st January 1945. The landlord replied in the affirmative but demanded a new rental of I.D.300/— per annum. This the Company refused to agreed to, and as the landlord could not see his way to ask a more reasonable rental, the Company dropped the matter. 5. Actually the house is in poor condition, and has only 3 ve *y small bed rooms, a long narrow sitting room and a dining room and kitchen. The kitchen and the ha outhouses are in bad state of repair. Before the Company could do anything with it it would have to be completely refitted again with lights, fans, bath room, lavatory etc.etc. all at Company expense, this being so the rent asked for, namely I.D.300/— appeared to be unreason able in the extreme. For arrangement of rooms etc. see sketch attached. Kuwait, 27-12-44.5./ JffTCLC SUitS 'A* to ’D J V No.199, Politioal Agency, Kuv;ait # 29th January, 1945. From r n, The Political A^ent, Kuwait The Secretary to the Kon’hle the Political Peailent in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. ftS ■5 3i r, I hove the honour to refer to your tele;’ran No.A/2005 dated the IBfch December, 1944, and to enclose plans for a house for the Agency Assistant Surgeon and also an estimate of materials required. 2 . Dr. and )rs. custodian of The plan was drav,n up by Kynas, an architect, and commlttee myself in consisting o? the role of •he interests of future Assistant Surgeons* 3. The question of whether the Kitchen should be inside or outside the house was considered at length and, in deference to &amp;rs. Hynes, who argued that the difficulties of getting cooks were now so great — and likely to increase when uhe Oil Company start operations — that she has to do, and future Surgeons’ wives will almost certainly have to do, most of their own cooking; and that for that reason the Kitchen should be inside the house for convenience, and in e reasonably cool place. Personally,,! favoured the placing of the dirking room, store room, and kitchen on the east side of the bouse and the drawing I'oom, office-study, and double bed room on the west and windward side so that the heat and fumes of the Kitchen v:ould not be blown into them by the prevailing wind from the North-west, and so that the kitchen got the morning, rather than the afternoon, sun. Ho ••ever, the majority favoured the plan as at present drawn. 4. The V, for eventual air- house has not been designed conditioning been iso Dr. Hynes considers that the cost of electricity in Kuwait precludes the Assistant Surgeon’s paying for tne running of air-conditioning inscalet ions himself. Py' own view is that the Government of India should install air- Conditioning throughout Officers’ houses — the Assistant Surgeon will shortly be an Officer, and future surgeons may well be officers of the I.A. .C,^ — free of cherge to the occupants as a contribution to efficiency. I shall state the case fop this, however, id my proposals for air-■‘•onAltloning the Agency building. If it is decided to build the house for air-condition ing throughout, the only alteration required in the plans is to lower the roc: 54 throe feet in the rooms to be conditioned, and to provide for double windows. Aiternalively, if the Government of Indie decide that officers ruet nay for air-conditioning and a future surgeon decides that he can pay for it, the entrance hell which is 31 H 10 X 10 f^et high /cnid be suitable for the purpose. It could be divided into two rooms by the use of a foiling door; it is pieced in the coolest part of the house, protected from the sun by rooms on ail sides, and well placed to get the benefit of through draughts when the shemal is blowing. The ’T’ shaped hall and passage are designed to utlize the Dhaiusl to the utmost. Experience of che Agency building shows that the full benefit of the Ghana1 — which varies from almost a full north to almost a full west wind — is obtained be creating a suction from the back of ohe house through rooms or passages which in turn creates a draught at an angle to the direction of the wind.© - 2 - 5. A study-cura-oTfice has been included because uhe Assistant Surgeon has a certain amount of office vvorK. to do, and there is no room in the Agency office for him. 6. /r.ter-born sanitation has been provided and is considered essential because of ohe difficulty of getting sweepers here. Unlike India, there is no .sweeper caste in Arabia. Persians are sometimes obtainable; but are extremely difficult to keep. Fhe Hynes have had. six since they arrived in June, und are now paying ri*.65/- a morith. /hen coolies can earn rJ.4/- per diem and their food carrying sand, or up to ns. 12/- as casual labourers carrying goods from the Customs to merchants * warehouses, they are unwilling to work as sweepers. 7. The water system may seem unduly elaborate; but the price of fresh, water — two annas per gallon ielivert.d — necessitates the use, in addition to it, of brackish well-water for baths, and of sea-water for water-born sanitation because the wells to not produce sufficient vr tor ^or both, fhis entails three separate systems of pipes and tanks. tittering has been provided to catch ell roof water and to conserve it in the ♦AbkmDar’. 8. Hue -louse will be built of coral stone, mud, gypsum, and cement. The estimates of materiel have been prepared to show the materials now reouired .from India in column 4 of the statement end os ed. 9. In considerin'* these proposals T would ask you to bear in mind that: (1) In Kir ait, unlike India, there is no organized recreational life for Eurooefins; there is no club; no cinema; and none of the ordinary amenities of 411 Indian Station. 3uropeans stationed here, therefore, turn more and more to domestic interests for recreation, and in these circumstances good housing is more than ordinarily necessary. (ii) The distance from India ana the expense of travel usually preclude the Assistant Surgeon from sending }iis wife anJ family to the hills in one summer, and u good house ia essential for any one spending tne summer in Kuwait. (iii) The Agency Surgeon will in fu&amp;ure almost certainly be an officer. Then the Kuwait Oil lompany restart operations and get settled in, company personnel will be housed in houses every bit as good as the one now proposed for the Assistant Surgeon with the addition that they will be air-conditioned throughout at the lompeny’s expense. You will appreciate that it is invidious that personnel of an Oil lompany should be better paid and better housed than officers of the Government of India, and it will not be conducive to the mental health of the Surgeon if he has to live and work under conditions palpably worse than others less qualified, less experienced, and better paid then himself — junior European personnel, certjinly of tfca Bahrain Oil Company, are engaged initially without any training or experience. A man labouring under a sense of injustice does not make a keen or efficient worker, nor does one physically oppressed by living in discomfort in such e difficult climate as that of Kuwait,3 (iv) .'1:1 le the ur.' ncy of tiie prefBent is &amp; pored;., ted, it is likely chat Agency burgeons will occupy the proposed liouse for the next twenty years; and the house should te designed for the future as much as for the present — the more so as the excellence of the site demands a reasonably good house. 10. Regarding the rent; if the copy of your letter to the Government of India seat with your indorsement No.£476-53/l05 dated the 3rd November, 1344, is a true copy, it appears that tne position has been inaccurately represented to the 'Government of Indie. The rent fixed as from the 1st April, 1944, for the house at present occupied was Ka. 1200/- and not 750/-. In July, 1944, the figure of ia.2000/- was tentatively mentioned to the landlord, and he was unwilling to accept it. Since then rents have increased enormously here, and His Highness is, as yet, unwilling or unable to control them. I attach a letter and enclosures from the Chief Local Representative of the Kuwait oil Company giving details of their most recent attempt to rent a : house here. The rent asked, 1.0.300/-, amounts to about ; 3.4000/- pei annum for an arab house in a bad state of repair without any fittings. I think the chancss, therefore, of getting a house , suitable for the Assistant Surgeon for lens than a. 1200/- are remote in the extreme. For their Manager the Imperial Bank of / w Iran here pay :ls.3000/- per annum for an arab house converted and fitted at their expense. ..hen His Highness built a house for the Manager of Cable and Wireless, the Company provided all the fittings at tneir expense. If His Highness has to pay for the imported fittings for the doctor*8 house he will probably reouire a proportionately higher rent, and. may insist on a higher payment per annum or on an extension of the period of the guarantee. LTCLOoUHE 21 11* t As the next steps I would suggest tnat the plan be accepted in principal, that the Government of India agree to provide the sanitary and electric fittings at their expense, &gt; rd that the '.W. J. should install them. 1 shouxu unen be authorized to show the plan to His Highness and to negotiate the best terms I can for the rent of the complete house and the site — the terms to provide for the fittings to ucoome ills Highness* property &gt; rui the cost uo be recovered to tfovernnent by deductions from the rent over a certain period. The terms negotiated would be provisional and would then be coi.iiuunicated to you for the approval of the Government of India bi;fo?'e acceptance. If the berms are not acceptable to ^he Government of India, they must themselves build for the Assistant Surgeon; and His Highness will almost certainly expect ground rent for the site. I I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. * Political Agent, Kuv.aitD.G. Mo. 232. jpolitical Kuwait. The 17th February, 1945.

It was my proposal that P.W.D. should instal plumbing and electricity and I am unable to estimate what they will charge to do so. Estimate should properly be made by P.W.D.. 3. It is suggested, however, that P.W.D. themselves place order direct on firms in England for shipment to Kuwait. Erom an estimate prepared from up-to- date quotations made to A.I.O.C. by the firms noted in enclosed statement ’A* it would appear that £.400/- would cover cost of fittings delivered Kuwait. 4. If the goods are ordered from India approximately 80$ should be added for Indian customs duty, profits, insurance and freight. It is understood that bathroom fittings are available with Balsara and Company, 43, Medows • Street, Fort, Bombay, and Empire Sanitary and Drainage Works, Opp: Municipal Office, Bunder Road, Karachi. 5. Alternatively, it may be possible to buy odd assortments of piping, bathroom and electrical fittings here for approximately 25$ more than prices in statement ’A 1 . I have already given Import Assistance Recommendations to local importer for piping and electrical fittings and same importer hopes to get offers of baths and commodes also, in which case Import Assistance Recommendation would be given. 6. If Government of India will not agree to P.V/.D. installing fittings at their expense a consolidated order as in statement ’A* could be placed in England by this Agency on behalf of Shaikh, and India Offices T assistance could be invoked to get it fulfilled^ otherwise we shall have to rely on any inferior and more expensive fittings that local importers may secure, or on India.

I am also sending a plan of the proposed house in the hope that you may be able to offer us something better or to obtain the opinion of an expert. 2. I personally maice no claims to architectural genius and I cannot aspire to improve on the plans which the Hynesfc and JacKson prepared with the assistance of a near-arohii/ect and the expenditure of much thought and effort. Bushire^ comments seem to emanate largely from the Indian Executive Engineer and to tend towards the Indian!sation of the house e.g. the outside Kitchen and the clerestory windows. The opinion of one of your experts would therefore be of great value but he should bear in mind that the house is to be built by the Shaikh out of materials available locally. This would seem to rule out the construction of a house of the type used by the Oil Companies, in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia at least. D.

E. r* It is difficult to comment properly on a house plan without a knowledge of the basic requirements and conditions laid down by the prospective owner or of any peculiar site conditions as well as the local materials in common use. There may also be constructional material, ready to hand which has influenced the design. For instance, the 4’-6' basement and 3 ft. deep concrete foundations seem fantastic to us here, yet there may be a reason for both. Dealing in general with the comments. The living rooms area is_ small in proportion to the whole and the plan form of the front with the main door^ recessed between the two large bays is not conducive to an attractive result. The reference to sanitary arrangements makes one ask why outside doors are indicated in the bathrooms. They take up good wall space and would seriously prejudice the layout of the fittings. Clerestory ventilators are not always sightly nor do they appeal to everyone. They are, however, a simple and practical means of clearing tbe upper portions of high rooms of stale hot air. With the information available there is little we can do but let them have our plans for the S.1 and X.5 types of houses. We also send a Fields plan that might be of use.

The 14th August, 1945. Kindly refer to Daubeny’s Demi-Official letter No. 2259-53/105 dated the 30th May, 1945. 2. I enclose a copy of a note by the Chief Engineer of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company at, Abadan an the proposed plan for the Agency Surgeonal house. Scotts views may be taken as boing the same as the Chief Engineer^. 3. My own views on your points are as follows:- (a) I agree in view of the Chief Engineer's conment. (b) Sky-lights were provided in a previous plan but were removed by my predecessor on the grounds that they made the plan look complicated and could always be put in while the house was being built. It was therefore the intention to have them. (c) Mrs.Hynes feels strongly that the kitchen should be in-doors. I am inclined to agree. Houses in Europe usually have a kitchen indoors and they do not invariably smell unpleasantly of cooking. The kitchen could, I think, with advantage, be moved to the far end of the house. This could be done by changing over the two halves of the rear portion of the house. (d) The drawing room and study could be air-conditioned and the latter used for sleeping in durii^ the sunmer. (e) The explanation at (b) above applies also to clerestory windows. I personally do not like them. (f) I agree, althou£$i the two central chimney stacks would probably not be seen by any one standing in front of the nouse as they are set far back. (g) Some rooms must be cn the South. It was intended to have a verandah (not shown on the section) to protect these rooms. The bedroom on the West side of the house should get the North-West wind nicely. (fy) Practically no well isjater will be available and what there is will be almost as salt as sea-water. The use of sea-water is therefore essential. It p. may not be out of place to mention that^Mrs.Hynes o^jtX j have had untold difficulty in their present house / over lack of sanitation. Even paying Ks.7G/- per mensem they have not (found it possible to get a man to do iohe sweepers work. There is no class here fitted by heredity and upbringing for this sort of work. (i) I agree but suggest that the sanitary lay out is not a matter oi sufficient importance to delay the submission of the scheme. It can be considered and improved later. 4. I am bringing to Shiraz copies of the plans for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's X-5, F.25, and F.lo houses. The last is the one we prefer and I have been waiting for thelast fortniAt for a detailed plan from Abadan. «o heard yesterday, nowever to the effect that 'No detailed plans for this type of house have been made.'

(c) That the house and fittings become his property when no longer required by the Government of India. 3. -7ith regard to (b) above I have pointed out to His Highness that the rent demanded is very considerably in excess of that which we contemplate paying but he maintains that the custom in Kuwait is to charge annual rent ® 10# of the capital cost of a house and that the house will certainly cost him more than Rs.60,000/- to build. It was only with considerable difficulty and 'for tfye sake of the Government* that he was induced to consent to a rental as low as &amp;.500/- per mensem. I have made enquiries from the Oil Company oiFthe matter of building costs and it appears that the Shaikh’s estimate is not excessive in view of the very high prices and wage-rates prevailing. 4.
