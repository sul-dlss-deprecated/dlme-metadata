H. B. M t s Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - (D His Highness has been informed by Haj Abdul Rehman al Kosaibi that his firm have become agents for Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth, cars. He has told His Highness that if His Highness wishes to buy for his own personal use one or some of these makes of cars he can arrange for them to be supplied to His Highness from U.3.A. or Canada. His Highness is very anxious to obtain^ some new touring cars and would like to avail himself of this offer. His Highness desires me to enquire from you whether if he buys one or more of these cars it will be possible for you to obtain for him a permit allowing the export from U.S.A. and shipping space. Adviser to the Government.&lt;D^ V No.2279-36/45. Political Agency* Bahrain* The 3rd June, 1945. To The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. Memor annual Please refer to your memorandum No.1028-9A dated the 24th May, 1945. 2. I think Hajji Abdur Rahman is over optimistic about his ability to procure cars from the N.S.A. or Canada, because, to the best of my knowledge, they are made available only in case of most urgent need connected with the war effort. 3. Much as I would like, therefore ; to help His Highness to obtain new cars I do not think it possible at this stage unless a very good case can be put up in support of his request. 4. Would you kindly explain the difficulties to His Highness?
