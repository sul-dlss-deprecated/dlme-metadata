There seems no reason to differ from this conclusion. 4. With regard to Lieut.Colonel Pyper’s position, it is anticipated that the medical licence will now 'be issued to him and he will continue to act as M.O. to the Vice- Consulate (losing his acting Vice-Consul’s allowance of Rs.100 per mensem) and will presumably also continue to have charge of the local hospital. Lieut.Colonel Paly took the opportunity to propose a revision of the allowances attached to the appointment of Medical Officer^ on the ground that it was an unpopular post with the and suggested Customs c cam pen s at ion of Rs.100 p.m. , Special pay Rs.200 and Local allowance -^ 3 . 200 . The Government of India do not reccmmen any increase in the existing allowances of Rs.50, Rs.loC and Rs.50. They are, moreover, of opinion that now that the Medical Officer will not 'be available to act as a Consular Officer there is small justification for retaining an I.M.S. officer there and propose that as soon as possible an Assistant Surgeon of the I.M.D. should be appointed. 5. This is an economical solution and it seems possible that the resulting saving will more than offset the cost of the creation of the new post. 6 . The Government of India have, in seeking for a further saving, examined the allowances now paid to the Consul-General himself - totalling Rs.1050 per mensem exclusive of Language allowance. As regards the Sumptuary allowance of Rs.500 the comparisons the Govt, of India make with other similar allowances are a convincing argument for their proposal to reduce it to Rs.150, and,as regards the Special pay, the fact that it was raised from Rs.250 to d Rs.300 per mensem on the amalgamation of the Consulate- General at Meshed with the Sistan Consulate (which reduced . the Indian Political cadre by one post) is sufficient argument/Minute Paper.

The reconditioning of the accommodation at Zabul will cost Rs.1200. The Government of India apparently do not consider this to be capital expenditure difference in the pay of a British I.M.S. officer and an difference in the absence of information as to the allowances which will be payable to the latter^but it will be considerable. The basic pay of a Lieutenant Assistant Surgeon ranges freon. Fs. 600 to Rs.1000 plus a Field Allowance. The saving would thus appear to amount to at least Rs.800 a month, in which case when Lieut.Col. Pyper has been replaced the proposals as a whole will result in an annual saving. 9.

The additional recurring cost of the proposals given as approximately Rs.7,600 per annum, less the Assistant Surgeon.

With reference to the correspondence ending with the papers forwarded with Foreign Secretary's weekly letter No.49(A)M, dated the 17th March 1936, I am directed to forward for information copies (1) Letter from His Majesty's Consul General for Khorasan, No. 7 . dated the 6 th ~'37£ / January 1936. (2) Cony of note from His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Tehran, to the Iranian Government, No.138(34/10/36), dated the 18th March 1936, with enclosure. His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, and M.Motamedy during their visit to Delhi in November 1935 it was agreed that the arrangement by which the Medical Officer at Zabul also acts as Vice Consul cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely and that the question of establishing a separate Vice- Consulate there should be considered. Colonel Daly was accordingly asked to submit proposals for the establishment of a Vice-Consulate at Zabul to be filled by an officer of the Indian Political of the communi cations cited ■in the margin. 2 . I am to say that after discussion with Department.2 . Department. His pronosals are contained In his letter of 6 th January 1936. The Government of India are of opinion that it is desirable to have a Consular officer at Zabul all the year round and they recommend that a new post of Vice-Consul should be created for this purpose and added to the cadre of the Indian Political Department. As regards his emoluments they consider that in addition to the basic pay of the Department he should be granted the following allowances (a) special pay Rs.iOOZ-per mensem, (b) Customs Compensatory allowance Rs.100/- per mensem, (c; Sumptuary allowance Rs. 100 /- per mensem. 3. As pointed out by Colonel Daly in paragraph 1 of his letter the posting of a separate Vice- Consul at Zabul raises the question, whether the medical officer should remain there in summer or should move to Meshed with the headquarters of •the Khorasan Consulate-General. Por the reasons given by Colonel Daly in paragraphs 3-5 of his letter the Government of India accept his sugges tion that the medical officer should in the first instance remain at Zabul in summer, paying occasional visits to Birjand and Zahidan. It is true that in his note No.139, dated the 18th March 1936 His Majesty’s Charge d'Affaires, Tehran, when informing the Iranian Government of the termination of the appointment of Lieutenant Colonel Pyper as His Majesty's Vice-Consul at Zabul, stated that the medical officer will cease to reside the entire year round at Zabul and will spend the summer months at Meshed. As however he has applied for a license which will be valid for the Provinces of Khorasan and Mekran, the Government ...3. Government of India consider that no difficulty is likely to arise vis-a-vis the Iranian Govern ment in retaining the medical officer st Zabul in Summer. 4. In oaragraphs 6 and 7 of his letter Colonel Daly has recommended an increase of Rs.EO/ per mensem in the special pay and allowances of the medical officer. The Government of India are well aware that, as stated by Colonel Daly, service at Zabul is unpopular among medical officers, but they cannot agree with him that it is justifiable to increase his emoluments at the very time when he is being relieved of his duties as Vice-Consul. As regards the allowance of Rs.100/- per mensem which the medical officer has been drawing for performing the duties of a Vice- Consul, the Government of India are of opinion that it was given for specific work and as the medical officer will not now perform those duties they recommend that it should be stopped from the date he ceased to perform the duties of a Vice-Consul. The allowances remaining with the post will then be - Rs. 150/- Special pay. Rs. 50/- Compensatory allowance. Rs. 50/- Customs Compensatory allowance. 5. I am to say that opportunity hns been taken to examine the possibility of effecting a countervailing saving by means of reduction in the scale of allowances drawn by the Consul- General for Khorasan. Excluding language pay for Persian, the allowances of the Consul-General are as follows :- Rs. 300/- Rs. 500/- Rs. 100/- Special oay. Sumptuary allowance.

In the opinion of the Governraent of India having regard to the importance of the post this scale of allowances is unjustifiable. It may he remarked that the present scale of sumptuary allowance is equal to that drawn by the Governor, North 'Vest Frontier Province, and the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan, and twice as much as that granted to the Agents to the Governor General in Rajnutana, Central India, the Persian Gulf and the Punjab States. For some time there has been general complaint that social intercourse with Iranians in East Iran has been almost entirely stopped under the orders of the Iranian Government Even if entertainment on a fairly lavish scale were possible, the Government of India cannot think that it would be necessary to pay as much as Rs.500/- per mensem at Meshed, still less is this the case under present conditions. The special pay moreover was raised from Rs.250/- to Rs.300/- on the amalgamation of the previous Sistan Consulate with the charge of the Consul General and should, they think, be reduced to the previous rate now that a Vice-Consulate is to be appointed. In view of these considerations the Government of India think that the allowances of the Consul-General should be fixed as follows wlth^effect from the date of the creation of the new Vice Consulate :- Rs. 25G/- Rs. 150/- Rs. 100/- Rs. 150/- Rs. 650/- Special pay. Sumptuary allowance. Conveyance allowance. Customs compensation aHowarce. Total. Even so the aggregate allowances will be higher than • • •5. ■?s&gt; than those drawn in the equally important and far more remote and inaccessible post at Kashgar. 6 . Further I am to say that in view of the fact that the medical officer will not now be required to perform consular duties, the question has arisen whether it is necessary to retain an officer of the I.M.S. at Zabul. The Government of India have carefully considered this asooct of the question and they have come to the conclusion that in the changed conditions there is small justification for retaining an I.M.S. officer at Zabul. They therefore recommend that in place of an I.M.S. officer an Assistant Surgeon of the I.M.D. should be appointed as medical officer at Zabul as soon as possible. The scale of allowances to be attached to such a post will be considered in due course. 7. Colonel Daly's proposals in the matter of office allowance, contained in paragraph 9 of his letter, seem reasonable and may be accepted. 8 . The creation of the post of a new Vice- Consul will necessitate an amendment of the Superior Civil Service rules and necessary amend ment will be submitted in due course. 9. A statement showing the financial effect of these proposals is attached. It is requested that His Majesty's Government may be asked to bear a moiety of the extra cost involved. 10. As His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, Tehran, has informed the Iranian Government of the termination of Colonel Pyper's appointment as Vice- Consul, it is desirable to post a Vice-Consul there as early as possible. It is therefore requested that the concurrence of His Majesty's Government in these proposals may be communicated by telegram. A • • *6. 11.

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Un tate&lt;MtMinute Paper, political Department, P.X.-jsis/ss ri s:i.o/ JS The propoeals of the Government of India to create a new post of Vice Consul at Zabul,to he added to the cadre of the Indian Political Department, arise out of the refusal of the Government of Iran to issue a medical licence,under the new regulations brought into force last year, to Lieut.Colonel Pyper, I^M.S., who has been acting as Medical Officer to the Consulate, as Vice Consul and as Medical Officer-in-Charge of a local hospital. The issue of the licence was refused on the ground that ’’Foreign diplomatic consular officers are not allowed in principle to engage in independent occupations in countries to which they are accredited and where they enjoy wholly or in part diplomatic privileges and exemptions”. The Foreign Office on receipt of copies of the correspondence advised that if a case were to arise in this c-ountry of a foreign salaried i consular official. ,who was also a duly qualified physician, desiring to carry on a private medical practice, H.M.G. would probably raise no objection but nevertheless the results might be embarrassing. 2. Pending discussion at Delhi the Government of Iran agreed to allow the existing position to continue for three months. Efforts to prolong the period failed and the !Government of India wish to post a Vice Consul to Zabul as early as possible. 3. The Consul-General recommended that the allowances attached to the post should be Customs compensation Rs.lOC p.m. , Special pay Rs.200 p.m., and Local Allowance Rs.100 Ip.m., Special and Local Allowances being in respect of the !climate, cost of living and lack of amenity. The Government of India recommend Customs compensation Rs.100, Special pay Rs.100 and Sumptuary allowance Rs.lCO (making a 2956 6000 7/34 total /19 k.o. i Gicggftm £ rom Letter Initials.

His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed appears to have had correspond ence, (which has not reached this Office), with the Government of India last summer, regarding the future of comprehensive report by the present Vice-Consul at Zabul, Mr. Tandy, on the Seistan Consulate. Mr. Tandy paints a sad picture of this outpost which only became important at the beginning of the sent there with the object of counter acting Russian intrigue, and promoting Anglo/1 Anglo-Iranian friendship and Indo-Iranian trade. Mr. Tandy attributes the decline to the fact that no longer is there a Russian Consulate there or any Russian trade or intrigue, that nowadays under a rigid autocracy the local Governor has little influence^ ^Ls all matters are referred to Tehran, and that Seistan with her lack of irrigation is no longer a trade route or of any importance commercially - In conclusion he recommends that the m post be held in abeyance so long as we could re-establish the post (should it again become necessary), without having to obtain the possibly hostile sanction of the Iranian Government; a conclusion which is endorsed by the Consul-General. ■ _uj5 ^C^-gaO^ Ka/v*, K- J tij.Hk ‘t“ h*~U Ut ******** to &amp;L.

A br ief_XBliei_oOr: »Al£X a ctivity in oe istazu__ It is unnecessary to go oack further tnan tiie beginning of the present century, when the eyes of all india were turned towards Rissia. The Russian advance had absorbed the central Asian Khanates and had reached tk the borders of Afghanistan and Persia. 3ne found England ready to defend Afghan frontiers by force of arms but lost no time in making her influence supreme in Tehran and Meshed. oeistan was the only large grain- producing area between Kandahar and Kirman, and Meshed and the sea, and, as such, it was of importance as a base for the armies of those days. It was the last stage for an army on the way to the Persian u-ulf from the north, on the way to Persia from the Hast or to India from the west. His si an opinion of the importance of Seistan can be judged from the following extract from the 'JMovoe vremya.** of the knd January 190b: “Seistan, by its geographical position and intrin sic nature, deserves, rather than Herat, the name of the “Key sex to India”. Seistan, that flank position on me the road to India which it is impossible to turn. aere it in our hands the advance to India would be made far easier. m English hands all our operations are rendered considerably more difficult. Lord Gurzon has a keen appreciation of the extreme importance of Seistan, and he is, therefore, striving to place it as quickly as possible under British influence*. ® .••...«»*•••••• • ' r Persia at the time appealed on the verge oi disintegration, and the E-ovemment of India no uoubt felt that, when that occurred, Seistan must fall to her share and not to Rissia* s.k- in tne last years of the 19th century Captain vvebb-Ware laid out the trade route from hushki to avoidance of the hazards and impositions entailed in passing through Afghan territory. Major Ghenevix-Trench officer on deputation, arrived in Seistan in January 1900 with orders to promote friendly Perso-British relations, to counteract Russian influence, and to promote trade. A Eussian Vice-Cojknsul was in residence before him. He found the deistanis already afraid of further Russian advance and heard rumours that the .Russian railway was being pushed on from Kushk via Herat to Seistan and Chahbar on the Persian Gulf. The Seistands h&amp;d already connections with Quetta where they used to send their wool and ghi, and the British officer was everywhere welcomed warmly. h'nglaad was looked to as the likeliest saviour irom the Russian menace, and the Seistanis expec ted soon to be brought under British rule, a prospect which they viewed with approval. The trade route was widely advertised in India, loans were advanced by Government to induce Indian traders to come to Bast Persia, and Persian merchants were given free railway passes in India to encourage them to open up the trade. Under these stimuli the trade rapidly expanded. The Russians, however, were not long in showing their dis approval of this idyllic state of affairs.

The great advantage of this route was itsUnder the Anglo-Persian treaty of 1867 Persia was bound to accept British arbitration in disputes with Afghanistan, and a British commission was sent in 1903 to settle the Perso-Afghan frontier in Seistan and decide on each country 1 s share of the Helmand water.

The Afghans were consistently friendly and helpful throughout. It is noteworthy that after the departure of the mission the British population in Beistan was only British influence and a decrease of Russian, due partly to the advance of our railway to Nushki and partly to the issue of the Busso-Japanese war. The advance of the railway combined with a G-ovemment contract system for camels for transport of goods from fushki to keshed materially increased our trade.

During this r^t the plague hospital was burnt and the consulate hospital damaged* There were grounds for believing that the Russians were not entirely innocent of complicity in this affair as some of the ringleaders were Russian adherents* The neglect of the Persians to punish the ringleaders and their inability to protect the consulate (aggravated by the desertion of many troops during the epidemic) led the government of India to send arras into Persia for the protection of their consulates* This had to be done without the sanction of the Persian Government (which would have taken months to procure) and the blow to their amour propre finally extinguished any desire they may have had to bring the rgiSters to justice* The immunity of the ringleaders was locally attributed to Russian protection and construed as a sign of the ascen dency of Russia over England at Tehran* On the other hand the efficacy of the inoculation at the British hospital was in marked contrast to the a. inefficiency of the Russian arrangements and was much appreciated by the Seistanis who freely availed themselves of it* Finally even the ringleaders of the xsik riot came to be inoculated and peace was restored. The effect of the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 was to ease the strained relations between the represen tatives of the two countries in Seistan; though it became imMszmxxm apparent/ *.apparent that Russia, having secured Tehran in the division of Persia, had the last say* It is noteworthy that at this time there was a Russian Lietenant Colonel as Military Attache to the Yice-Consulate in Seistan* The succeeding years were marked by the severe growing-pains of constitutionalism in Persia* Crisis followed crisis in Tehran and Lawlessness and highway robbery was rife in Seistan* Arms-smuggling caravans of truculent Afghans, against whom the Persian authorities were powerless, passed through Seistan and the Kainat every few days* In 1909 the Russians dealt a fatal blow to any slight popularity they may have had with the Persians by bombarding the shrine of Imam Reza at Meshed* In 1910 the Russian Consul for Seistan and Kain practically made his headquarters in Sirjand and the British telegraphist there was made Vice-Consul as an antidote. In 1911 the Russian bank at Zabul was closed as it had never paid its way* The British hospital at Zabul became very popular and undoubtedly made the Seistanis think kindly of us* Finally in 1912 the landing of British troops in South Persia to counteract Russian action in North Persia was rather welcomed than resented in Seistan. Although in 1914 Persian public opinion seemed to prefer England to Russia, when confronted with an alliance of these two enemies it became strongly pro-German* The inability or unwillingness of Persia to stop German 'military missions* passing through to Afghanistan or to control illegal arms traffic, compelled us to institute the East Persian Cordon* No attempt was made to resist the entry of British troops and the prosperity and security they brought in their wake was much appreciated. The old struggle between England and Russia for influence in Seistan and Baluchistan was ended in England's favour when in March 1918 charge of the Russian Vice-Consulate in Zabul was handed over to the British Consul.(//) * Eclipse of Seis in. ♦Seistan Diary No *31 of 4th April 1922, para 37. Soviet activity in Seistan. At the end of thv war our rail./ay reached Zahidan and the Palang Kuh route to Meshed to the west of Seistan was adopted* Zahul was therefore short-circuited and cxacxxft ceased to be an entreuot for Indo-Persian trade. In 1922 when the Persian customs authorities moved from Zabul to Zahidan the British Consul reported in his diary, u Dusdap (Zahidan) has now entirely superseded Seistan as the chief trade centre in South-East Persia'. The ten years 1920 to 1930 saw considerable anti- British activity on the part of the Soviet Vice-Consul in Zabul, who did his best to capture the Seistan market for Russian goods. Even the Seistanis, however, soon saw through his rude propaganda Methods which were effectively put a stop to by Sarhang hurtaza Khan kukri (present Ustandar for Liukran); and when the Russians realised that there was no Seistan market to capture they closed their Consulate (1930). This coincided with the visit of the present Shall to Seistan and was attributed entirely t o his action. At the same time Iran was straining every nerve to become up-to-date and western, to eliminate foreign Since 1930 . influence from the country and to develop her natural resources. In his diary for Jaiuary 1932 para 2, the Consul forX&amp;gflOKX Seistan states 'The new Governor told H.M. Consul that the Persians had, since the Shah , s visit, definitely decided to * develop Seistan. The first step was to be the construc tion of a metalled road to link Zahidan with Meshed via Zabul, and it is hoped also itfc link the latter place with Kandahar by road ' Needless to say this ambitious plan was hskx never translated into action, and Seistan, after a brief period in the lime light, has gratefully relapsed into the slumber of centuries from which it was so rudely awakened forty years ago.Part II, The present position in Seistaru Seistan is one of the remotest of the provinces of Iran and gets correspondingly little attention from the Government, Its only importance in the eyes of Persian officialdom is as an outpost threatened by British and/or Afghan aggression. Possibly for this reason, and possibly out of sheer inertia and financial inability, nothing is being done for the improvement of the country. It is n P clear txiat at one time Seistan was a po/uiLous and j£KH$£x prosperous tract, when it was the birth place of the cele brated Hustum and the cradle of the dynasty which c ame to a rule over Persia. It is/land with abundant water lying between the dessicated wastes of Afghanistan and Iran, and could again be rendered fertile by modern irrigation and drainage. Although there are frequently disastrous always floods in the spfcing, there is nearly acfcwxyy a water shortage in the autumn. The land is waterlogged and treeless, and the present methods of irrigation are aboriginal. The Seistan peasant is deterred from inaking improvements by insecurity of tenure and by the fact that any profit which he may v/ring from the soil goes forthwith into the pockets of Government. His standard of living is as low as, or even lower than, that of the Indian peasant. There is no prospect of improvement for many years to come as her mnbitious programme of railway sonstruction leaves Iran with no money to spend on irrigating and draining far-off feistan. Further, remoteness and paucity of communications would prohibit the profitable exportation oi an agricultural surplus. Finally, any large irrigation scheme would have to be carried out jointly by Iran and iiighanistan ano. v^ould involve negotiations far more intricate and prolonged than any we have yet seen in guroxje .lo The first British officer was sent to Seistan to counteract Russian intrigues, promote Anglo-Iranian friendship, and to encourage Inao-Iranian trade, and it will be simplest now to consider the present work for a Vice-Consul under these three heads, and finally to review the various offices performed by the consulate in the past in the light of the necessities of today. There is now no Russian Consulate, hospital or bank in Seistan, nor is there any Russian trade or intrigue. Consulate. The Russian bogey has been laid, and, as there appears no immediate prospect of its resurrection, that part of our work is finished. Tehran* How-a-days, under a rigid autocracy, the local Governor retains joot a vesti ;e of initiative or independence. In even txie most trivial matters he must refer to Tehran, and his personal friendship for Britain, if he dared to bestow it, would be valueless. British influence can only be effectively asserted at 'Saran. Modern Iran in the days of her childhood was bestt by the wicked uncles of England and Russia, and the treatment she received at their hands has made her violently anti-foreign in these, the days of her adolescence. Part I of this minute should have made it clear that the love of Iran for her neighbours has always varied inversely with per power. Now that the Russians are no longer on the scene in Seistan the animosity of the Iranians is % concentrated on the British, ,/hat amounts to a boycott | of the consulate is enforced. Baluch Sardars and local notables are now no longer allowed to visit the Vice-Consul, wnose influence with them is nil. In any ca.^e the course Russia and Seistan. All that Zabul sees of the outside world is the British Anglo-Iranian relations in Seistan. In pre-war Persia there was some point in winning the good opinions of the hereditary Governors af Seistan and the Kainat, who were under very light control from&amp; u of the operations which Iran has conducted against the Balucliifi of the Sarhad in the last few years must have convinced them that there is no help to be lookea for from Britain. Members of the consulate xa; are watched and their movements reported. The consulate hospital,it is true, still operates, but it will only do so as long as the pi'esent sub-assistant Surgeon,who obtained a licence to practice before the days of the boycott, remains, when he goes (and he has been many years there now) the consulate hospital in Zabul, as elsewhere will have to close its doors to the local people. The Iranians do not know what our object is in maintaining an expensive consulate where there is no visible justification for one, but they are sure it is nefarious. The Vice-Consul, almost incarcerated in his house and cut off from all contact with the people^ can do nothing to promote Anglo- Iranian friendship. In fact his very presence imperils it. In days past even Afghan trade from Herat to Quetta used to pass through Seistan to avoid the duties levied in Kandahar, and the Consul used to do his best to facilitate it. Large numbers of Babers from the Snob usea to visit Seistan in the winter to collect assafoetida. They now no longer come intb Iran. Lastly, the Consul used to endeavour to stir the Persians into resisting the passage of arms- smugglers from Persia to Afghanistan. None of these duties at present exist to occupy the Vice-Consul. In t-.e past the Consul used to collect information from as far* afield as Herat, Kandahar and the Sarhad, for which Zabul was the Metropolis. This is now impossible as the Afghan frontier is to all intents and purposes closed, and the Sarhad centres round Zahidan. In fact the Vice-Consul has to re^iy on his clerk and the British Indian traders for information about Seistan, and from his own knowledge can add nothigg to, nor subtract anything from, what they say. Intelligence from the Sarhad is collected in Zahidan. Trie Vice-Consul no longer, therefore, performs useful service in any of the ways mentioned above. Finally, I venture to think that the mechanisation of modern armies has materially lessened the importance of Seistan as a ^se for war. Large grain sup lies are no longer so essential for an army as supplies of petrol.'K frcie in beisten. traae from India to Persia passes it by and tifaere is no legitimate trade across the Afghan frontier* There is not a single merchant, Incdan or Iranian, in Zabul who imports merchandise from abroad* Tea, spices and paper, the chief articles of Indian origin, are all ordered iron Zahidan, to a total value of some dials 55,000 per annum only* The estimated annual value of the articles smuggled from Afghanistan ana Baluchistan is rdals,100,000, but I am informed that British subjects do not engage in this trace. .Opart from a little cloth and haberdashery there is no market for British goods in Seistan, the few needs of the Seistani peasant beini all supplied Irom Iranian sources. Exports from beistsn go only to other parts of Iran and are of the estimated value of three to four million Rials -per annum* Only one British Indian tracer exports wool, ghi and hides from Seistan (to lie shed), and that to an annual value of only Riels 60,000.

It is likely that a way may soon be found to enable the Inaians to export their capital from Iren at a not too runinous rate* ihe most likely development appears, therefore, to be a decrease to vanishing point of the British Indian population and trace m ieistan* any comprehensive improvement in the irrigation of beistan presents great difficulties. The Helnand is an Afghan river arc bears the water from the snow and rain which falls on Afghan sibil, dut^bhe MacMahon award diviced the water and the land of Seistan between Afghanistan and Persia. dir Henry Macllahon did not expect this award to be permanent, and it presents great obstacles to the utilisation of the nelmand water on modem lines. A scheme is necessary to hold up the spring floods of the Helmand, store them, and release the water in the summer and autumn for irrigation. The Hamuns should also be drained. The first part of this scheme would entail the construction of a dam which must lie either wholly or partily in Afghan territory.

Please see the Minpites at P.Z.297/37 below. The Government of India are only willing to meet us half-way. Their original proposal was that the special pay and allowances attached to the post of Medical Officer, V Zabul, should remain at Rs-250 a month. In view of &gt;&lt;N Lieutenant•Colonel Laly’s recommendations that they should be raised to Rs.500 a month and the comraents of the Medical Adviser, it was suggested to the Government of India that a total of Rs.350 a month was justified. After further consideration the Government of India are not prepared to give more than Rs.300, although they are aware that the post was unpopular amongst I.M.S. officers when the allowances attached to it (including the allowance for • acting as Vice-Consul) amounted to Rs.350. 2 . In view of their attitude it is doubtful whether we can p? ess our suggestion any further. It is understood that Captain E.A. O’Connor (an I.M.S. officer of nine No. ^ 'i-S'iKAr.

Perhaps so long as a junbr officer holds the appointment, the special pay 4&gt; and allowances now proposed are sufilcient. 3. ''ith regard to the customs compensatory allowance, which is to be increased from Rs.50 to Rs.100 a month, all that the Government of India are proposing to do is to bring this allowance into line with that drawn by the Vice Consul, Eahidan, the new Vice Consul, Zabul, and the Xv. r- OT* ' Vvjl^i Residency Surgeon, Bushire. Prom correspondence (p.Z.1558/ 37), a copy of which was received from the Government of India, it appears that the Consul General in the Persian ^ulf and the Consul General for Khorasan both submitted proposals to Government of India last year for a 100 % increase/ B0fi3 Wt 9696/P 28 5000 4.37 101increase in the customs compensatory allowances drawn hy all their Consular staffs, and that the Consul General foi* Khorasan proposed an increase from Rs.50 to Rs.200 per mensem in the case of the Medical Office^ Zabul (now Meshed). The Government of India’s reply suggests that some general increase may be granted, but no proposals have yet been submitted to the Secretary of State. It is not clear from the Government of India’s letter below whether the increase now proposed for the M.O. Meshed will be regarded as meeting the claim put forward by the Consul General, Khorasan, or whether Rs.lOO will be regarded as the basic rate to which any increase which may be granted to the Consular Staffs generally will be added. It is proposed to put the point to the Government of India. 4. The approval of H.M.G. to the proposal that an I.M.S. post should be retained in East Iran and their acceptance of half the cost has yet to be obtained. It is. to be hoped that they will not insist on the score of economy, on the original proposal of the Government of India to appoint an Assistant Surgeon. - 7^-7 ODD 1937 Secretary, S. &amp; G- Department .

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your despatch ?o.363 (k 9681/7017/234) of the 7th September 1936,regarding the creation of a post of Vice-Consul at zabul,separate from that of Medical Officer. It will be remembered that this step was made necessary by the objection raised by the Iranian Ooverment at the end of 1935 to the post of Vice-Consul being held by the Medical Officer. This objection has given rise to considerable correspondence.with the details of which I need not trouble you. But I think that a report on the present position with regard to medical officers at His Majesty’s Consular posts in Tran may be of interest to your Department. 2 . ’£he Iranian government were duly informed that the Covernraent of India were ready to comply with their request that the posts of Medical officer and Vice-Consul at Zabul should be separated,and that Lieutenant-Colonel typer’s appointment as Vice-Consul had therefore been terminated. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs were consequently requested to proceed with the issue to Lieutenant-Colonel pyper of a licence to practise medicine at zabul. Several months passed without the licence being forthcoming,and when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at last replied in July 1936, it was found that the Iranian Oovernment had entirely changed their ground and now argued that Zabul was fully provided with Iranian doctors and an Iranian hospital,that there was therefore no need for any further doctor there,and that no licence could be issued to colonel &gt;yper. Repeated efforts /were }he Right Honourable, Anthony ^den IUC.,!!•?•, etc., etc., etc.. The Foreign Office, LO^D«Xi, S. Vi. 1 .- 2 - war# mad# by Hia ajasty^ Legation to permiada the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to obtain a reversal of thia d«aislon,but without trace &lt;*83. It be cane evident that it had become a matter of prestige for the Iranian medical authorities to prevent the appointment of another foreign doctor to Kabul. It appeared moreover useless to pursue the request for a licence,since it would always be easy for the local authorities to prevent Iranian subjects coming to the Consulate hospital. Ae for as I a© aware,the Consulate hospital at Kabul has not actually been closed,since there in still an Indian sub-Assistant Surgeon who holds a licence to practice in that town. But I believe that very few patients,if any.now come to the hospital, and that it must be closed when the present Indian doctor is transferred elsewhere. Colonel ?yper left Kabul on leave prior to trans fer to another post in oct ober 1956. The Government of India Have decided that the officer of the Indian Medical Service who is to suoeed him should In future reside at Meshedoccupying the house in the Consulate-General formerly used by the Secretary. The officer appointed to this post is Captain Aloyslus O'Connor,Indian Medical Service,who io expected to arrive shortly. The Government of India hoped that it Blight be possible to secure for him a licence entitling hi© to practise at Birjand ,Kabul and Kahidan as well as at Meshed,or failing this,permission to treat British subjects at Birjand, j Kabul and Kahidan. Though repeated efforts were made to |persuade the Iranian Government to agree to one of these altern&amp;tlv# 8 ,lt proved impossible to obtain better terms than that Captain 0*Connor should be allowed full practise at Meshed among Iranian as well as British subject*,but should only be allowed to treat members of the staffs of His Majesty’s viee- Co isulates at the other three towns.

It was therefore surprising that when the Iranian Oovernaent objected to grant ing a medical licence to Colonel *&gt;yper,they did not also raise the question of Doctor Fustl Haq*o lioenoe.which wan issued to him shortly before the diacussions over Colonel pyper's case arose. It was .however .only a taatter of time before they realised that Doctor Fax! Kaq was also acting as vice-consul and Medical Officer and,as reported in ray telegrams ^ob. 191 and 19i£ of the S2nd October 1936,a note w*ire»toaltfd from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanding that he should cease practising medicine. Very aoon after Doctor Fazl Kaq received a peremptory demand to the same effect from the local Health Department. It was clearly posseible to resist the demand if he was to remain Vice-Consul,and the only question to decide was whether he should cease to be Vice-Consul or to be Medical Officer in charge of a public dispensary. After consulting His Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorassaa,the Government of India decided that the Birjaud dispensary should be closed and that Doctor F&amp;zl Kaq ahould cease to practice medicine. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs were informed accordingly,and at the same time I protested at the tone of the letters addressed to Doctor Fazl Haq by the looal Health Department.

Dissatisfaction over this question added to general reluctance to make a final decision, a reluctance which is also delaying the settlement of Turkish Consular districts, makes it I fear, improbable that the Iranian Government will in the immediate future agree to the re-definition of Consular districts proposed by His Majesty's Legation. I think their assent might be facilitated if the Government of India were able to agree to the appointment of an Iranian Vice-Consul at Quetta, and I have the honour to enclose a copy of a despatch which I /am The klght Honourable Anthony Men, K.C., U.P., etc., etc*, etc*.

But if the Iranian Government are informed that the post at JOiorramahahr lias been raised to a Consulate, I /fear•m &amp; mm ( ?7 ^ fear that they niay refuse to agree to include Ahadan-Khorramshahr in the district of His Majesty’s Consulat Ahwaz.

Your Excellency’s, most obedient berviint.#7th February,1937. X have the honour to refer to your despatch j?o*461 (T. 1632£/14606/3cJ5) of the 19th iforetaber 1936,regardIn^; the appointment of an Iranian Vice-Conaul at Quetta, I have nov/ received a copy of the Oovernrnent of India’s express letter to the Secretary of State for India, 6 Zlui/L'6 of the ^th February,stating that they do not wish to raise any objection to this appointment. In a sub sequent telegram regarding the appointment of a T unopean medical officer to the staff of His Majesty’s Consulate- General for Zhorassan (the position with regard to which is explained in my despatch Iio.69 of the £5th February) the Government of India suggested that their concession over the appointment of an Iranian Vice-consul at { uetta might be used to obtain better conditions of practice for this Medical Officer. I consider .however that it is most unliicely that the Iranian Government would be willing to make any further concession at present in the question of the Medical officer. I think therefore that the friendly attitude of the Government of India regarding the Vice-Consul at (uetta might be more usefully advanced as an argument to persuade the Iranian Government to show the same accommodating spirit over the connected question of the redefinition of our Consular districts in Iran,as suggested in my' despatch Ho.37 of the 26th January. If therefore the Government of India’s decision has not already been conrunicated to the Iranian rogation in Londonj woul* suggoat that the Ration * ould act he informed of It uatll monsieur Soh.n y . 0 arrival. He might then he told at I'he Bight Honourable, Anthony Helen 24.c! # &amp;.p., e tc. t etc., etc., *he Foiman office / theCOPY (K 4070/685/234) POKEION OFFICE, S.W.l No.212 9th June, 1937 Sir With reference to your despatch No.79 (245/6/37) of 27th February I would observe that, although from some points of view it would be convenient to have the British consular districts in Iran clearly defined, the absence of such definition has not, so far as I am aware, led in practice to any serious difficulty. 2. A somewhat similar question has recently been considered in regard to His Majesty’s Consuls in the Soviet Union. In this connexion I am advised that a consular officer is only entitled to perform notarial acts in ’’the place” where he exercises his functions. Although however his powers in this respect may be limited to acting within the place or district specified in his Commission, on the other hand so long as the actual oath is administered by him or the actual certificate or attestation is affixed by him at a place within his district, it does not matter, from the point of view of British law, if the document relates to or comes from a place outside it, or that the person for whom the document is being made is not resident in his district. In short, he should not carry out the mechanical function of swearing, attesting, etc. except at a place within his consular district. Thus so far as a Consul’s activities under the Commissioner for Oaths Act H.J. Seymour, Esq., C.M.G., C.V.O., e tc •, e tc • , e tc • , Tehran.Act are concerned, imprecision in the definition of his district is unlikely to prove troublesome. So far as his other activities are concerned it is improbable, in the absence of any authority likely to wish to challenge the validity of such activities, that the disadvantages of an improperly defined district will be any greater. b. In these circumstances it does not seem necessary to attempt to use the concession of the Government of India over the appointment ol an Iranian V^ice—Consul at Quetta as a means of influencing the Iranian Government in the matter of consular districts. 4. The effect on existing consular arrangements of the division of Khuzistan into two Governorates, referred to in your despatch No. &lt;57 of &lt;26th January is however a matter for enquiry and for such action as you may consider advisable. I am, e tc ., (For the Secretary of State) (Signed) D.J. SCOTT.Minute Paper. P.Z.297/37 Department. i V 531!&gt;B 5000 10/36 Please see Minutes below regarding the proposal of the Government of India to reduce the allowances of the I.M.S. officer in East Iran to Rs.250 per mensem. It is felt that in view of Colonel Daly’s statement in X his letter of 6 th January, 1936, (flag ’A’) that n for many years past medical officers have expressed extreme dissatisfaction in regard to their emoluments in this post, and have expressed a sense of suffering an^ injustice” (a statement made in relation to the post of I.M.S. officer and Vice Consul, Zabul, to which allowances of Rs.350 per mensem were attached), and of Sir J. Megaw’s opinion that with the allowances proposed by the Government of India the new post would be regarded as a penal appointment, a strong case exists for suggesting to the Government of India that the allowances which they propose should be increased by Rs.lOO per mensem, there may not be sufficient reasons for pressing them to grant the allowances proposed by Colonel Daly, be It rna^, however, that the Government of India had in mind that, as there will no longer be any objection to the officer engaging in private practice, the post will be adequately paid with allowances of Rs.250 per mensem only. It is accordingly proposed to invite the attention of the Government of India to the considerations referred to above, and to suggest that an addition of Rs.lOO per mensem to their proposals would seem to be appropriate. The Foreign Office will be invited to accept a moiety of the cost when the reply of the Government of India has been received. A draft iixpress Letter to the Government of India is submitted accordingly. • I . i. ^ 7 ,r- Secretary, Servicea &amp; General Department, Secretary, Military Department , Medical Adviser, Secretary, Financial Department, Please see the minutes on P.Z. 3689/36. It was then proposed in connection with the creation of the post of Vice-Consul at Zabul and certain other reorganisations that the medical post attached to the Consulate-General, Meshed, should in future he held not by an I.M.S. officer in civil employ but by a member of the Indian Medical Department. Before sanctioning this item of the Government of India’s proposals it was decided to go back to them and make sure that they had given proper consideration to the question whether an officer of the I.M.D. would be an adequate medical incumbent in view of the fact that Mr. Squire, the new Consul-General at Meshed, was known to be taking with him his wife and family. The Government of India in their express letter of the 15th December agree that the I.M.S. post should be retained. This is satisfactory so far as it goes, but a difficulty arises in regard to the emoluments of the post. Until recently the I.M.S. officer has been a Vice-Consul and has received an allowance of Rs.100 per mensem for doing this duty. Recently, however, the Persian Government have insisted that it is improper for a Vice-Consul also to practise as a medical man, and it has become necessary to create a separate post of Vice-Consul. Thus the Medical Officer loses his allowance of Rs.100. The emoluments of the post were in any case felt, especially by Lieut.Colonel Daly, the outgoing Consul- ( 7 4/ General, to be inadequate, and ir? his letter of the 6th Jan. at P.Z.3689 (Flag A) Colonel Daly suggested that M the minimum allowances which should be granted to remove what appears to be somewhat justifiable dissatisfaction' should2. be Special Pay Rs.200, Local Allowance Rs.200, and Customs Compensatory Allowance Rs.lOO, a total of Rs.500 per mensem, compared with Rs.350 per mensem (including the Rs.lOO for consular duties) or Rs.250 which will be all A that on the existing basis the officer will be entitled to draw in future when the consular allowance has been / taken away. The Government of India in their letter of the 14th May, paragraph 4, very properly say that as the Medical Officer will not perform the duties he should no longer receive the allowance, and it is clearly impossible to keep on the consular allowance of Rs.lOO as such. On the other hand it seems clearly undesirable to reduce the Medical Officer’s emoluments, and it appears that there might be a possible way out. (u&lt;u) tfiWAJ) In their letter of the 15th December the Government A of India say that they consider that the Officer should act as consular doctor for all consular posts in East Persia with headquarters at Meshed, and should no longer be stationed at Zabul. On the face of it it would seem that this involves a certain extension of the sphere of the officer’s medical duties, and might at any rate justify the increase of the rate of Special Pay from Rs.150 to Rs.250 per mensem. This would give the Medical Officer the same allowances as have been drawn up to date, which seems to be the minimum that can in fairness be given to him. sidn*ut uniMvhtu) Subject to your observations it is proposed to write ’(aaHLA to tne Government of India on these .**11 owaivees, perhaps in the sense of the attached draft express let ter &lt;wJl} (\y.r $ CM&lt;K ^ A mV ' ' U ' u - XQ ^ F/Vjiy* ■Minute Paper.

I am impressed by the arguments put forward by Diout-enant—Colonc-1 Daly in para .6 of his letter of 6 th January, 1936, No.7-3/6, regarding the allowances attached to the post of I.M.S. officer and Vice Consul, Zabul, and, while I appreciate difficulty of increasing allowances &amp;£»*£**ULme, I cannot view with equanimity their reduction to Rs.250 per mensem. In these circumstances and in view of the fact that the duties of the Medical Officer are b&amp;iMg extended to cover all Consular posts in East Iran, fa I am prepared to to aek 4 ^ r. t n an addition of Rs.100 per mensem to the special pay attached to the post, making total allowances of &lt;m htu»r Rs.350 per mensem, unless there is any good reason to suppose that grant of medical licence will enable officer to secure substantial increase in private practice' whfeh seems unlikely since itwould appear from para.4 of Daly’s Despatch of 28th February, 1934, No. 68-15/9, that private practice in East Persia is in any case negligible.
