The majority of the correspondence is between the British Legation in Jeddah and the Foreign and Colonial Offices in London. Copies were often sent to the Political Residency in Bushire, the Political Agencies in Bahrain and Kuwait, and the High Commissioners in Baghdad and Jerusalem.The volume follows the evolution of the Treaty:Britain's initial reluctance, due to their official friendship with King Hussein, to engage with the issue prior to Ibn Sa'ud's conquest of the Hejaz;how this event then gave cause for the Bahra and Hadda agreements of November 1925;the negotiations between Ibn Sa'ud and Gilbert Clayton in early 1927 leading to the signing of the Treaty of Jeddah on 20 May that year and its ratification in August.At the end of the volume (folios192-196) is Clayton's final report on his mission to the Hejaz and includes a copy of the Treaty.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Palestine and Transjordan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>High Commissioner, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>King of Hejaz Ḥusayn bin 'Alī al-Hāshimī</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Gilbert Falkingham Clayton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Hejaz</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000223#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000223#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000223#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
