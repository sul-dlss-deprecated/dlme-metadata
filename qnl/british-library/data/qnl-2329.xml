Addressed to Foreign Office telegram No.1221 of November 24th repeated to Moscow, Washington. M. Nikpay has just shown me a personal report from Comoander-in-Chief Azerbaijan to the Prime Minister. It is to the effect that there will shortly be a general penetration of North Persia by elements despatched from the Soviet Union as follows: (a) A large body of Barzanis to cross the frontier between Julfa and Maku and with other Kurdish tribes to occupy Rezaieh and Mahabad, » # (b)^ Pishevari and Iveam Yahyah, with a following Of Muhajirs and Armenians of Persian origin to pass through [grps. undec] and Ardebil in the direction of [grp. undec. ? Mianeh]. (c) A large number of other Muhajirs to enter M^janderan* Gurgan and Khorassan under the personal direction of Muzaffar Firouz and eventually to move on Tehran. Vehicles of Irano - Sovtrans will be used to distribute small arms and ammunition in the provinces concerned which as soon as garrisons have been [grp. undec]. Overpowered will be cut off from all communication with the rest of the country. 2. This report is said to be based on information from a [grp undec. ? good] source and in view of menacing tone of latest Soviet note the Prime Minister feels that it must be taken seriously. He is in fact Convinced that Russians have decided to retaliate either in this or in some other form. 3. Persian reply to Soviet Government was despatched last night. 4.

After my tour of Azerbaijan and shortly before I went on leave I spoke at some length both to the Shah and to the Prime Minister s representative Nikpay about the importance of pursuing a constructive policy in that province. Mr. Cresswell also spoke to His Majesty in the same sense on November 1st (see his telegram No. 1152). I will seek an early opportunity of reverting to the subject but I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by doing so immediately on my return from leave, more especially as the oil agreement has monopolised everyone's attention until a week or two ago. 2. If the Russians intend to react adversely to the Majlis decision they may well do so gradually and after some delay. This would apply inter alia to the infiltration of Barzanis and other irregulars, but at present there is no tangible evidence of any such intention.

I saw Prime Minister this morning and spoke to him as instructed in your telegram No: 658, Ms regards the in struction in paragraph 4 of your teleg ram No:841 0 to Washington, the Prime Minister said that Persian Ambassador had confirmed the fact that a message in this sense had been given him in your name by the Under Secretary of State and he desired me to thank you for it 0 2. prime Minister then said that he had received a report to the effect that Russians had assembled in the vicinity of Azerbaijan frontier a large number of Persian refugees estimated at about 10,000 and among then Mullah Mustafa and his Barzanis. It was suspected that before long this irregular force might attempt to enter Persian territory and if they did, they would of course be resisted by every means available to the Persian Government. But the Prime Minister thought the Soviet Government might seek to exploit such a situation by invoking Article 6 of 1921 Treaty and he therefore enquired whether penetration of Persian territory by this irregular force would in itself constitute sufficient basis for an appeal to the Security Council. I said that naturally I mas in no way qualified to answer such e. question but that it seemed to me clear^ that answer unquestionably depends upon scale of penetration and ability of Persian forces to deal with it efiactively. 3. Prime Minister then told me that when presenting draft Oil Agreement to him for signature (see my telegram No: 888 ) Soviet Ambassador had conveyed a message from his Government to the following effect:- If, he said, the agreement were now to be concluded, the Soviet Government would regard the prime Minister and his country as bound to them by ties of intimate friendship and would be prepared for closest possible collaboration with them.. If drafted agreement were not con cluded they would regard the Prime Minister the Persian Government and the Persian people as their s ’blood enemies'. Prime /,A ( 2 ) Prime Minister said that he had felt bound to protest at violence of Ambassador's language which seemed to him ^ altogether inappropriate to uresent situation, the only point of difference between then being whether agreement should be signed or not before it was submitted to the Majl is. As Ambassador knew, he was categorically forbidoen by Persian law to sign such an agreement without the approval of the Majlis. Foreign Office please pass Washington as my telegram No:72.

R. 11.0. a.m. 16th May 154-7. Repeated to Foreign Office No. 1. Saving. &amp; * * S S s i My telegram No. 122. Governor-General told me last night that he was quite satisfied with the elections in Tabriz. There had been no untoward incidents and such complaints as were being made were unimportant and came from disgruntled unsuccessful candidates or from 'inspired* 1 sources. The men who had been elected were persons of standing who could be relied upon to do their duty. 2. Discreet enquiries which I have been making do not confirm the allegation that the Governor-General may be seeking to curry favour with the Russians (my telegram No. 111, paragraph 3). Nevertheless it seems clear that both he and his subordinates have abandoned the attitude of almost complete disregard of Russian opinion which was characteristic of them during the first quarter of this year, and that they are now taking every care to avoid any action which ijiight cause displeasure to Soviet representative here. 3. Governor-General expressed some anxiety at delay of Central Government in sending the necessary credits for the economic reconstruction of Azerbaijan. Both he and the various Government Departments in the province had done all the necessary spade work without loss of time as unemployed had to be absorbed into the proposed public works (buildings, roads, railways) as soon as possible. Nevertheless Tehran was showing more interest in politics than economics and such a policy wa dangerous as unemployed in Tabriz (I believe there are not less than 15,000) were becoming restive and their goodwill was fast disappearing.Under-Secretary of State 8 33093-1No. 129 British Embassy, Tehran.

The second object was only partially achieved, since, by the date that the area of operations was reached, the tribe was in flight through the mountains towards Iraq and the military column were halted awaiting developments. 3* The tour was extended in order to gain an impression of the general state of the civil population, to check up on the strength of forces in Azerbaijan and the general state of the Army, to visit the frontier and to check up on routes. 4* Notes »n these points and on subsidiary information gained are being submitted separately as be^ow:- (a) N«te cn the present situation ef the BARZANI: (fe) Report rn the military aspects mf the operations: (c) Report tn the re-organization and order of battle «f Persian Forces-n#w in Azerbaijan and Furdistan: (d) Pep«rt «n the defences on the Russo- Persian Frontier: (e) Note on Persian .army equipment: (f) Note on imports of Russian oil into Persia: (g) N«te on a massacre of Armenians: (h) Report on harbours on Lake Rezaieh: (i) Corrections and additions to Rcute Reports:* - 2 - All rnnks spoko v;ith respect of the fighting qualities of the tribesmen, saying that they fought till their last round and were only afraid of planes and tank Th^'- also appear to have made full use of their guns, for thj column c®mmander at QAixuPI ZIVEH spoke of a total of ~f0 rounds having been fired against his troops*00 MILITARY ASE3CT OF THE OPERATIONS OP THE THE BARZANIS. 3 (a) TACTICS. (i) The operations on the TERGAWAR and MSRGAWAR pLains had taken 28 days v/ith the use of a foroe consisting of 5 squadrons of cavalry, 7 infantry battalions, one battery of 75 nun Bofors mountain guns, 2 light and 2 medium tanks. (ii) The pegawar plain is bounded by continuous steep mountains cn the West, and rising'by gently sloping hills to a series of high features v/ith some precipices on the East. (iii) The operations had consisted of a series of encircling attacks on the Eastern features which successfully commanded the linos held by the tribesmen on the plains, followed by frontal attacks on their positions in the plains. The terrain v/as ideal for defence. (iv) The operations appeared to have been generally successful as casualties had boon about 30 killed .and 70 wounded in this area. (v) The disposition of the forces on 8th April was curious. From the BARANDUZ CHAI (B.33) exclusive, i^o pt.9603 inclusive were located 5 infantry battalions:- a cavalry regiment and 2 infantry battalions (less a company at ZHERAWA (Bt5323) with a battery of artillery and two tanks were concentrating at QALEH ZIVEH (b«A725) end 2 squadrons of cavalry closing on NERGI (B.4835) from SILVANA (b. 4345)» The Eastern and Southern edges of the plain where the Barzanis were likely to be encountered were held solely by tribal levies. This state of affairs was, however, in keeping with the usual Persian Army practice of putting friendly tribes into the forefront cf the battle. ( b ) COMMUNICA TI ONS, OR DERS AND SITUATION REPOR TS. (i) Communications appeared good. Telephone lines had been laid by Engineers to all units within reasonable distance and both column headquarters were in communication with Divisional Headquarters at Rezaieh and each other by telephone.For outlying posts radio sets and helio,graph were in use. A heliograph v/as seen in operation between NAQ^DEK to a post 14 kilometres away in the USHNUIYEH plain and appeared to be working efficiently. A test message sent by radio telephone to an outlying post received a quick reply. (ii) Orders were issued by Divisional Headquarters daily at 2000 or as occasion demanded to column headquarters and thence to units. Situation reports were being sent up to Division Headquarters and down to units in the morning and evening, with intermediate ones if necessary. An intermediate report emanating from aerial reconnaissance wemt badly astray for it arrived at Naqadeh column headquarters reporting 60 tents in the area of the Western part »f the USHNUIYEH plain whereas it was in reality destined for MERGAWAR column headquarters reporting the some tents in \ the hills South-West of that plain. ( 0 ) COLUMN H EA DQUAR TERS PER SONN EL. These were very inadequate and an unnecessary strain must be thrown column commanders. At Naqadeh column headquarters Sartip Boglari had no staff officers in evidence at all. At Margawar column headquarters of Sarhang Naisari there v/as an acting second-in-command who was also commanding the cavalry regiment and a'Brigade Major’was also seen. Comment on this elicited the'infermation that Brigade headquarters never have more than three or four officers and that difficulty is experienced in this matter as the Army is short of junior officers.

(a) Pour months after the recovery of the province the G-#vomment Forces are beginning to attain a fair decree ofro-organization. (b) For tho operations against the Barzanis and for the garrisoning ©f some areas those troops which formed the original ’expeditionary force’ are still being employed. Those units which are garrisoning the area are to be retained there until such time as the period of service of the conscripts has expired. When this period has elapsed the unit will be dissolved and its permanent cadre of officers and N.C.Os. returned to Tehran. (c) At the same time the nucleus of the permanent Azerbaijan Division is rapidly assuming shape. In the first half of April the Assistant British Military Attache visited Divisional and Brigade Headquarters at both Rezaieh and Tabriz, the Tabriz Infantry Regiment, and Briga.de Headquarters at Ardebil. All ••mmanders reported a great enthusiasm for military service among young men who had suffered under the uncertainty during the days of the occupation and under the Azerbaijan Democrats. Sarlashgar Zarrabi reported that he ha.d been able to fill the complement of his infa,ntry regiment at Tabriz - 1,945 men - and to send &amp; further 500 4&gt;o Tehran for units there. At Ardebil the strength of the regiment had reached about BOO men a.nd at Rezaieh, where recruiting had been in force for only one week, the regiment commander reported a stream of men which was more than satisfactory. (d) At Tabriz the regiment a.ppop.red to have an enthusir.sm which is rare and the turn-out and bearing of the men on pa.ra.de wn.s comparatively good. The indications are that, if the a.dministration ca.n be raised to such standa.rd that the first enthusiasm of these recruits can be maintained, the Division can produce a formation which can be a model for the rest of Iran. The main difficulty which is . l»eing experienced at the moment is a shortage of junior officers. This was remarked * * n S-'t ^11 levels in all formations and the great number of promotions in the field ranks at this Persian New Year was the subject of caustic comment. An interim order of battle consequent on the re-organization is attached as an appendix to this note. /Appendix► • * • V /( d ) SUBJE CT: - mJSSLW _PR(Mm Dn^^CBS^ON PERSI/iN BCRMl. The following notes mnde by the Assistant British Military Attache during his tour of Azerbaijan are forwarded herewith. 1* Defence s and construc tions at JULPA. The majority of the buildings of the Russian town are hidden from the Persian side by a yellow cliff; they can be observed from the South-West from a point on the rising ground along the road to KHOI about 4 miles from the town. They are all built around the railway station and appear to be surrounded by a wall about 12 feet high. Host conspicuous are four double-storied buildings which have the appearance of barracks. At the S*uth-West corner of this area is a wooden observation tower, three stories high. To the North-East in a high re-entrant in the hills (marked KARIMKULI DIZEH - map J-38*D. (1941) S*2022) is a large group of buildings which are again most clearly observed from the KHOI road or from the area near the railway bridge. Leading up to these from Russian Julfa is a road, telephone line and (apparently) power line. They were described as barracks by the Persians but might be a factory of some typo. On the.bank of the river at approximately S 0815 is a large building which appears to be a pump house. Directly across the road bridge work was in progress on the beginnings of what were said to be further pumps. NOTE . Hap J-38*J.bf June 1943 shows the road and railway crossing the ARAS East of Julfa by a bridge. This is incorrect. The road bridge is due North of the railway station and no road runs up to the railway bridge. A double apron barbed wire fence runs along the bank a few yards back from the river from behind the cliff mentioned above towards the railway. Clearly to bo seen are 3 pill boxes - one in the bank a few yards to the V/est of the bridge and below the level of it, and two set further back among mounds to the East of the bridge about 1C yards apart. Of these the Western one and the nearer of the two Eastern ones face d. e South. ’While the one of the two Eastern ones which is further from the bridge faces South-East. No other prepared defences were visible. 2# DEFENCES AND CONSTRU CTIONS IN THE n STARA AREA. .after descending from the high pass coming from the area of Ardebil the road to Astara enters a ravine and, approaching the Russian frontier at Varid (Map J-396 Z.7259) runs along it as far as Astara itself. Prom Varid to approximately Bibandi (Z.8466) the route is through a narrow ravine which opens out gradually over the last three miles. The area is very .thickly wooded and the undergrowth dense so that observation is exceedingly difficult: the hills rise precipitously on either side of the ravine. Beyond Bibandi the plain is also very wooded but observation is less difficult. Camouflage of posts or defences is easy. In the gorge the Persian and Russian frontier roads run close together and generally at the same level, with only the stream of the Astara Chai separating them. At times they are no more than 100 yards apart. The road on the Russian side has a gravel surface, is about 12 feet wide and two-way traffic on it would bo difficult. As it is constructed along the side of the hill there are innumerable points v/here it could be blocked by slides from above or by the suhsidonoe of the road itself. Alongside the road runs a telephone line, four wires on a single wooden pole. At Varid, and for some distance thereafter, no wiring was visible and a Persian Army officer at Varid said that there was only a single strand wire fence to prevent the passage of animals. Prom about Kasbi to Astara, however, a fence was clearly visible. This was a five-strand double apron barbed wire fence of standard /pattern1 I Note (d) continued* pattern carried on metal posts about 4 feet high, of any typo to indicate that electrified alarm wiros 1011 19 L , J There v/ere no signs of' insulate: were carried. Between Vand and Bibandi three posts cnly were seen, each apparently big enough to hold 20 to JO men. In addition there were hir^i observation towers widely separated which commanded an exceedingly good view of the frontier for several miles* x/t one point there also appeared to be a pill box or observation post situated well back from the frontier and up the side of a hill. ^ Bibandi a. most conspicuous pill box was observed commanding the road on the Persian side of the frontier towards Ardebil. This was built in the hill side about 100 foot above a military post there. No other defences were seen but it is emphasised that the close nature of the country hindered accurate observation. The observation towers had telephone wires running up to them. ^ Little activity was observed. No patrols were seen: sentries in observation towers appeared idle and one tower was entirely unmanned. 3* SUPHiifliiiNT ARY INPOR^LiT^ON. Batmanqili^f,, commanding the Ardebil Brigade, stated that he ha.' recently visited the frontier area between Z. 6373 and Z 6470 (map J-39 O) and that he .e there were many signs of new activity: a new wire fence and emplacements were in process of construction. , . ., . ^ &gt;ors ^ an F r °ntier Commissioner at Astara said that there was seldom a^v activity during the day but that it was intense at night: automobiles and, presunabV, tanks could be heard moving at all hours.

Durinp: a tour of AZERBAIJAN during the first half of April 1947 the Assistant Brxtish I^ilitary Attache made the following notes on harbours on Lake Rezaieh. 2. • Da nal u Harb our. (a) Location and general description. The harbour is located on the Eastern shore of the lake opposite U / loin island. It is approached by a gravel surface road (N.T.Routes in Iran 1942 Volume I - Route II - p). The harbour lies in a shallow bay and immediately backed by low undulating hills to a depth of 2 miles. Behind these there is an open plain extern inf for several miles in all directions. The topography is, therefore, ideal for the defence of the harbour from attack from the land, - A ' oneral oko^ah may is attftehod, (b) Lay-out and condition of the harbour. (i) The p#rt buildings lie in a shallow identation in the hills. The shore runs d*wn-1# a very gradually sloping beach. The depth of water at the end of the Jetty is said t» be 6 feet, Prom the Shore a Jetty on wooden piles runs out for a distance »f .approximatoly 400 yards. The height above the water is approximately 12 feet and the width 8 feet. On the Northern side is a stone and gravel ’bund’ v running «ut ab*ut 3 rd of the length of the Jetty .and of the same height- (■*'•*') ihe harbour buildings consist of three storage sheds and some offices bui_i.t round three sides of a square. Each shed is approximately 60 yards long by 30 feet wide. The floors are of concrete as also are the walls to a height of 4 feet: the upper section of the walls and the roof are of mud, the latter being supported*by wooden pillars and beams. J (iii) A Deccaville rail track is laid from the end of the Jetty and leads up to the storage sheds ftfe-shav-m on the attached okotoh map. The track is rusty but otherwise in fair condition. There were two standard flat waggons in workable j condition and 3 broken. (^ minor employee of the Ministry of Communications was in charpe of the harbour. u 3- HAIDARABAD harbour. ( a J Location and general description. ^he hTurbour lies at the South-Western corner of the lake »n the junction of the Khaneh - Rezaieh - l.'ianduab Roads (M.T.Routes in Iran, 1942, Vol.l aoutes XIV - A, B, ana E). It lies at the Southern end of a strip of coastal plain about 2 miles long: the plain is surrounded on all sides by low rolling hills. (*) .state of repair. (^) 1 ^ Le harbour is in a state of ruin. All buildings are roofless and windowloss, but being built of stone could be easily repaired. There are various offices and one storage shed about 120 feet long by 30 feet wide. The pillars and iramework^ofithe roof are still in position and only metal sheeting would be required ^ The consists of a stone and gravel ’bund 1 leading out to a wooden Jetty, the combined length of the two being about 2^0 yards. The bund has been -4 destroyed either by storms or from the effects of the salinity and would require completely rebuilding. The wooden Jetty is still standing but would require strengthening in places before use.(iii) Two of a formor Dooo^ville or three rails and one broken flat waggon indicate the existence track leading from the end of the jetty to the storage sxio (iv) The harbour is manned by 3 tribal guards.t / ti T / [This telegram is of particular secrec/ and should be retained by the authorised recipient ■arid hot passed on.] Cypher/OTP 19th February, 1947 R: 6.20 p.m. 19th February, 1947 Repeated to Government of India, Following received from Tabriz telegram No. 41 of 17th February.

I have no (repeat no) evidence to confirm that the military authorities have upset the bulk of the people in Azerbaijan. On the contrary these have been urging the Army to take all possible steps to clear up the security situation (disarming of the population is obviously a prime necessity for the return to normal conditions). As for dishonesty I know that General Zarrabi recently recalled 4 officers for accepting bribes. 2. Under martial law the Governor General is, of course, forced to take second place but in the conversation with General Zarrabi which I had on 6th February (my telegram No.26) I gathered that he seemed anxious to get his part Bagdad Angora Moscow Washington ofof the job finished so that the civil administration could get on with theirs. In the existing circumstances a charge of supineness could be easily made against anyone in the place of the Governor-General, and it would be hard to refuteo I am not (repeat I am not) satisfied however that it is justifiedo The Governor-General is fully conscious of the implications of his office, he works hard and enjoys the affection of the people to a noteworthy extent* 5* Since about the middle of January there has been some talk against the Prime Minister in Army circles in Tabriz on the grounds that he covets more power than he should have* This naturally causes a certain degree of friction between the Army and civil authorities but I believe the statement of Nikpay quoted in the last sentence of paragraph 2 of your telegram No.190 to the Foreign Office is a gross exaggeration. 4. A 'whispering campaign' that all is far from well in Azerbaijan, inspired by Russian sources, has been going on with the object of causing a general feeling of insecurity and undermining public confidence in any officials sent by the Prime Minister* Frequent change of these officials is only playing into Russian hands. 5.

Ui ^hen Balfour was calling on him today on another matter-the Director of hear East affairs-at the State Depart ;ent referred to the question of 10,000 Barzanis who, armed with 3,000 rifles, are now living as refugees from Iraq in a district of Northern Persia some 25 miles from Iraqi border. He informed Balfour that the Go^Orrnent of Iraq had recently consented to allow these tribesmen, who had been used by the Soviet to support the puppet ^zerbaizan Government, to return to their dwelling place across the border but had refused an amnesty for past offences to 118 of their number including their leader Nulla Hustap ha. 2. Henderson then produced a telegram dated January 28th from the United States ambassador at Tehran, reporting that, at the instances of Persian Chief of Staff, he had recently received Nulla kustanha who was visiting Tehran under safe conduct. Mulla ivjustapha had declared, so far as he was concerned, all or none of the tribesmen would leave Persia and had invoked American assistance to settle the problem of the tribesmen’s return with Iraqi and British authorities. Hr ^llen had pointed out that this matter was not within the United States competence. 3. 'The ^ambassador also reported in his telegram that [grp undec] Shah had recently spoken to him on the subject and had expressed his concern at the fact that it would be the obligation of the Persian Government in international law to disarm the refugees before sending them back to their homeland. 4. In bringing this matter to Balfour^ notice, Henderson was at pains to explain that he was not making any formal representations in a question which can [? grp omitted] concern United States Government, He enquired however whether, in view /ofof the desirability of ridding Northern Persia of •. .these; .alien tribesmen who could on soma future occasion again be used by the Russians against the Persians, we might not think it appropriate to use our influence with the Government of Irag. to persuade them to reconsider their decision to refuse an amnesty to kulla kustapha and other tribesmen concerned and to arrange for the disarmament of the tribesmen at the frontier if they thereupon decided to return to Iraq. 5, In the event of our deciding to make such an^approach to the Iraqi Government, lx Henderson said that the United States Government would be happy to support our representations.r * » .r i C O Sr [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on].

When I last saw the Prime klnister four days ago I impressed upon him at length importance of enforcing greatest restraint in dealing with subversive elements in Azerbaijan and Kashgai. I urged him to forestall critiaism which I felt sure would develop and which is now developing by eschewing all foims of retaliation. 2. The Prime Minister expressed complete agreement and I believe he is doing his level best to pursue a moderate policy. ky telegram No. 2033 contained the latest information on the subject which I have been able to collect and I do not consider that any punitive measures indicated therein are excessive. It would have been an affront to public opinion to leave Javid or Shabastari at liberty for in spite of their surrender they were until the eleventh hour guilty of incitement to armed insurrection. So far as I ar. aware they are not likely to be harshly treated.

During the 2-4. hours which elapsed between surrender and arrival of Government troops in Tabriz many old scores were no doubt paid off but the army put an end to all this as soon as they arrived on the scene. The i/Iilitary uttach6 is just leaving for a tour of Azerbaijan and I have asked him to collect all information he can about the behaviour of troops. 3. -u good indication of the Prime Minister's present policy is his choice of the new Governor General of Azerbaijan. Sadiqi's father was for many years deputy for Tabriz and he himself represented the same constituency in the last Majlis. In recent post he has cultivated ? ? friendly relations with [grp.undec. ? Saudi Arabians] in Persia and with the leaders of Tudeh Party. Last June he accompanied Muzaffar Firuz on his mission to Tabriz. The Prime Minister has been criticised for this appoint ment on the ground that this Governor General is certain to temper wind to the rebels. What is more pending Sadiqi’s arrival in Tabriz, the Prime Minister has despatched a special commission there led by a member of his own secretariat which is to report on the situation /andand to restore public confidence, 4-. It must not be forgotten however that there is at the present time a very strong natural feeling of resentment against all left wing elements in this country. ns was to be foreseen, the re establishment of contact with Azerbaijan and [grp.omtd,] on grounds of what has been going on there for the past twelve months under the guise of 'democratic and progressive' has greatly strengthened the hand of national reaction. The Prime Minister's personal character is now very high but he will I foresee need [grp.undec. ?allj his strength to bring the ship back, on to an even keel. I will continue to give him all possible support in this and my United States colleague is I know doing likewise.

Mullah Mustafa Barzani has asked the General Officer Commanding to try and obtain pardon for him from the Iraqi Government or failing that permission for his residence in Iran.

In the course of a press conference on December 28th the Minister for Labour and Propaganda, Aramcsh, made a statement on the recent activities of the Tudeh Party in the course of which he said that the number of Tudeh adherents may amount to a million but they are not ell responsible for what has occured. It is possible that only some 30 of them may have been guilty of treason. All political parties must be respected, provided they do not attack the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country. We have nothing against the Tudeh party but we wish public opinion to be informed of the truth. The people to-day must realise that it should not run after all those who set themselves up as the champions of liberty. Similarly, those who make such pretensions are not entitled to indulge in any activity which pleases them. I believe that there are many numbers of the Tudeh party who were sincere and were not in any way party to the crimes committed in the north but unfortunately there were criminals among tnem.

In addition to speaking to the Prime Minister about the importance of moderation in Azerbaijan I also reverted to arguments described in final paragraph of my telegram No. 1950 and deprecated complete suppression of the Tudeh Party* I pointed out that unless effective measures were taken to prevent such political retaliation, the Prime Minister would be presenting his enemies with deadly ammunition for use against him and his new party. Lven moderate foreign opinion would be tempted to believe that the devil had been cast out by Beelzebub. 2. The prime Minister replied that activity against Tudeh was urgently necessary on security grounds. The Government had ample evidence of their subversive intentions not only in the provinces but also in the vicinity of Tehran itself. Quantities of weapons had already been seized and there was evidence of a widespread plot to undermine the authority of the Government. He therefore had no choice /butr - 2 - 4nl but to deal drastically with the whole organisation. 3. Since the above conversation further particulars have been published about these subversive plans which appear to have taken a particularly dangerous form in Mazanderan. On December 24-th the new Minister of Labour and Propaganda, .iramesh, stated in a press interview that those workers who had recently been punished had been found guilty, beyond any question, of planning an armed insurrection. They were in possession of small arms of all kinds, including machine guns. Hand grenades and explosives had been found in their houses. They planned to cut communications between the capital and Juazanderan and other northern provinces. The Government had acted promptly and nipped the whole movement in the bud. (This was no doubt the incident previously referred to by M.Nikpay, see my telegram No. 1969 paragraph 3). 4-. ^ delegation of journalists which has just visited Lazanderan to investigate, published an agreed report on December 26th which amplifies and confirms M. xiramesh's allegations. iiccording to this report factories in kazanderan had become 'fortresses' where arms of all kinds were concealed and even manufactured. The Tudeh Party is said to have instituted a veritable reign of terror making levies in kind and appointing 'security agents' of their own with a view to early secession from Caspian provinces. ./hen their plans were frustrated they were /on-3- on the point of pushing an armed insurrection* Pull text of this report follows by bag. 5* I have been slow to report this story lest it should turn out to be merely an electioneering stunt and I have had no opportunity yet to verify but I have little doubt that there is some fire behind all this smoke. I should find it very hard to believe that the earnestness with which Prime minister spoke about these subversive activities ten days ago was not genuine.

Another passage in the same broadcast was to the effect that the Persian Democrat party could not be expected to renounce votes in favour of its adversaries or of ambitious nonentities* These phrases are no doubt meant to indicate Tudeh party on the one hand and Prime Minister's rivals of the Right on the other.En Glair r\ CaBINi/f DISTRIBUTION / THOL TBBRmf TO FORSIGi'J OgglGB Mr. vie Rodgetel, D.3.55.p.ra.

The following elucidation may therefore be in point. 2, Elections normally begin in this country with the convention of electoral committee, a process which may take days or weeks. When all these committees are formed the Goverment notifies them of the actual dates of polling and they do their best to comply with this instruction - not always with complete success. December 7th v/as the date fixed for the Convention of Committees, but this step was deferred pending the clarification of the situation in Azerbaijan. Prime Minister however confirmed to me yesterday that elections would begin as soon as new Governor General and provincial authorities were installed in Azerbaijan, i.e. ’’in a week or so”.3. Strictly speaking the recent despatch of security forces to Azerbaijan in accordance with the Prime Minister's proclamation (see my telegram 1889)^’’^ may be considered as the first phase of the general election. The despatch of polling inspectors to all constituencies and the formation of electoral committees will presumably be the next. 4. According to the decree under which elections were called (see my telegram 1806) the actual polling, once it starts, is not to last more than five days. 5. In order to minimise the risk of misrepresenting the facts about the elections, B.B.G. and other British agencies might be advised to follow Tehran radio when dealing with this delicate subject.

Sir Text of report follows. interferences- 2 - Icf interferences in the internal affairs of Iran. It will be recalled that a result of these interferences is that the Central G-ovemment has been denied the exercise of effective control in the Province of Azerbaijan. Unfortunately in spite of every effort to remove by conciliatory means the consequences of these interferences the Central Government has not yet been able to re-establish its authority in that Province. Elections to provide for the selection of the Madjless, our national legislature, have been called to take place throughout Iran beginning December 7th. In order to assure that the election procedures are duly followed it has been arranged that military forces shall be stationed in all the Provinces of Iran. Those in control of affairs in Azerbaijan have objected to the entry of such Government forces into that Province. The Soviet Ambassador at Tehran acting under instructions from his Government has given friendly admonition that the movement of Government forces into this part of Iran may result in disturbances within that Province and on the Persian borders adjacent to Russia and advised that the Government’s plans be abandoned. It is of course the duty of my Government to exercise its sovereign responsibilities and to assure that the elections are carried out impartially in Azerbaijan as well as in the rest of Iran; and my Government for that, purpose must station its troops in Azerbaijan no less than in other parts of the country. It is hoped that this will not be used as a pretext for hostile demonstrations but my Government willfit./'. g-UVj ECFiET $ziL [This tele gram is of particular secrecy’ and - should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on]. ..Cypher/OTP OuBIFIiT DISTRIBIVION FROM nOoCOTO FO R EIGN CPPICB Sir M* Peterson.

He does not know exactly what they mean but suspects that their statement points to a refusal to give any guarantee of political non intervention.

Repeated to : British Middle E.st Office, Cairo New York (FEDERAL) Moscow Washington Delhi Bagdad My telegram No. 1945, paragraph 2. It was stated in newspapers this morning that the President of Azerbaijan Provincial Council replied to the Prime Minister's telegram through the Governor General and informed him that despatch of forces to Azerbaijan was unnecessary and that the Government should be satis fied to send inspectors. He maintained that under the terms of the agreement concluaea in June last the Azerbaijan Fidais were already recognised as part of the regular forces of the State and that accordingly the Government should not send any other forces from outside the Province. 2. The Prime Minister replied on December 1st in the following terms to the Governor General. 'I have received your telegram reporting the views of the Provincial Council of Azerbaijan. it must be pointed out that the question of despatching forces is not one regarding- 2 - rcgaiding which the Provincial Council are entitled to express views whether approval or disapproval. In referring this matter to them, which is one within the sole competence of the Government, you exceed your proper administrative functions. It is unnecessary to explain to you that the Goveruiient's decision is in no way a contravention of any agreements which they have concluded and it is a mistake to imagine that such agreements bar the way to the discharge by the Government of their duties and responsibilities. r pho Provincial Council must not suppose that Azerbaijan enjoys rights or privilege which make it different from other provinces of the country or place it outside the laws of the land. The Government consider that it is necessary thau the elections should be carried out in all parts of the country freely &amp;nd in accordance with the provisions of the lav/. As the present forces in Azerbaijan have not yet won public confidence, and are not yet organised in a regular manner, they cannot be regarded as adequate to maintain order during the elections. It is necessary, therefore, for other forces to be sent to Azerbaijan for this purpose. If the Government's decision is accepted with confidence and goodwill there need be no cause for anxiety and the elections will take place freely to the public satisfaction. But if the entry of these forces into Azerbaijan is obstruc ted the Azerbaijan leaders will bear a heavy responsibility for the consequences.

It reiterates determination of G-havam to resist in spite of the Soviet Ambassador’s statement and confirms his intention to send -Persien troops into Azerbaijan.

The ijnbassador is then instructed to deliver a letter to the Secretary General as soon as possible, (It seems that the appeal for aid from the Security Council was not made in this letter when finally delivered), 3, The text of the second telegram communicated by the Persian Ambassador, which was received on December 8th is as follows: “That the decision of the Government in sending forces from the capital is for the purpose of ensuring the smooth course of the elections h^s been repeatedly telegraphed to those in charge of affairs in Azerbaijan. Nevertheless, a telegram was received tonight from Tabriz indicating that contrary to the orders of the Government, elections havo commenced prior to the arrival of the Government Forces* “It is obvious that this action on the part of those in charge in Azerbaijan is fresh evidence of their / insubordinationTT - %' 1 r ’F j | c X T' bo f ■ ♦ -5- • ' d* insubordination and rebellion and that an election made under such circumstances is not acceptable. “I have immediately cabled this to the Governor General of Azerbaijan and Governor of Tabriz, and I have also instructed that the actual message should be broadcast by radio and published in the newspapers. •’I consider it necessary to acquaint you of this immediately to enable you to lay before the necessary authorities these facts which constitute a further demonstration of their rebellious and contumacious attitude”. 4.

The Government have frequently made it clear that they desire only to carry out their obligations and perform their duty. They had never expected that irresponsible people in Azerbaijan in spite of all the efforts which have been made to conciliate them, would deliberately distort their intentions and adopt a hostile and rebellious attitude towards the despatch of security troops to Azerbaijan, I have repeatedly explained to the Governor General of Azerbaijan that the decision of the Government to send security forces to his province does not mean any kind of aggression or military operation but is intended solely to ensure the proper conduct of the elections and the peace and contentment of the people. Unhappily the assurances which I have given on this subject have been insolently and maliciously distorted. The radio station at Tabriz, which is the source of so many lies and calumnies, declares that the Government wish to attack and destroy the people of Azerbaijan [gp. undec. ? and it] has levelled monstrous accusations against the officers and men of our noble army. All this has been said in spite • • • •, 4 R &gt; spite cf the fact that the '^orerntiient -teve v/orked peaceably day and night for months to establish the happiness of the people of all parts of the country, especially those of Azerbaijan. It is a sad business that these Azerbaijani adventurers have forgotten all these things and are now making such deplorably wicked statements. The Government have no wish for civil war and bloodshed but they cannot disregard their duty to defend the independence and integrity of the country and protect the lives, property and liberty of the people. Azerbaijan kidais have fired on army posts near Qaflan Kuh and if they have suffered loss from the reply of our soldiers that is their own fault. All the people of the country and of the world should know that the Government have no aim or purpose other than the peace and liberty of the people, the execution of the laws and the proper conduct of a free election for Parliament. To the people of Azerbaijan they have shown the utmost patience and goodwill and if now a handful of adventurers seek to destroy the integrity and independence of the country, the Government must do their duty. Press also reports that on December 7th Persian army aircraft dropped pamphlets over Tabriz and Mianch calling on the people of Azerbaijan to revolt against their oppressors, hang them and take the affairs of their province into their own hands.

IMPORTANT 7&lt;rJ3 Tehran telegram to you No. 1859. Muzaffer Firuz called on me this morning after presentation of his letters. 2. He explained that his policy, rejection of which he implied had led to his transfer to Moscow, had been to allow the Azerbaijan elections to take place without interference by the Government and to admit the Azerbaijan deputies so elected in to the Mejlis. This for two reasons: Firstly, the Azerbaijan deputies plus the Tudeh members (he said the Tudeh was not a Persian party in any sense of the word) would not amount to more than 30 while the Democratic Party would have at least 85. Azerbaijan influence would thus be neglible and with the Mejlis once in session Azerbaijan question could have been resolved within ' ! a couple of years if . Secondly,Secondly, (please see Mr. Le Rougetel r s 3 telegram No. 1950 to you) as soon as the Mejlis had approved the Soviet oil concession it was to bo anticipated that Russian pressure over Azerbaijan would be relaxed. 3. Ambassador added that in particular he had always deprecated any form of reference to the Security Council since he did not see what practical assistance could be expected from that body apart from sympathy and moral support. He had found the Russians since his arrival in Moscow to be much concerned over Northern Persia and to be showing every sign of 'toughness”. They had been promised confirmation of oil concession within seven months of signature. Nine months had already elapsed. 4. Ambassador did not know whether Persian Government troops had actually tried to enter Azerbaijan although he had heard there had been a skirmish. His anxiety was increased by a feeling that the Persian army might not fight in a cause which they might well not regard as representing a national interest but rather the private interest of a few wealthy people (he was rather obscure on this point and evidently reluctant to say anything against the Prime Minister). He referred to the suspicious nature of the Russians and even to the apprehensions v/hich they entertained for the safety of Baku, though he did not press this last point when I characterised it as absurd. Russians could put from 10,000 to 20,000 trained men into Azerbaijan from their side-3- i side of the frontier whom no one could distinguish from Persian Azerbaijanis. 5. I said I did not know what line the Security Council would take or whether indeed they could take any line in default of evidence to show that Government troops had actually attempted to enter Azerbaijan and had been resisted. But I thought Ambassador greatly under-estimated the effect which even moral support by the Security Council would produce on the Russians at the present conjuncture of world affairs. And I also felt that the two-year period to which he had referred as necessary for the solution of the Azerbaijan question might under the policy which he himself advocated result in the total loss of the province to Persia. I told him that Northern Persia was not the only case in which the Russians were trying hard to secure control of areas adjacent to their frontiers. 'The procedure might be a natural one for the Russians to attempt but it was fraught with the gravest danger to the neighbouring countries concerned. 6. Ambassador spoke in veiled denunciation of British policy which he implied tended to concentrate on the support of ’’priests andtribes”. It was a great pity we still thought in terms of 20 or 30 years ago and made no real effort to rally round us the progressive elements now springing up in Persia. These elements were not Communist. 7. I said we were ready to support any progressive element but thought he was inclined to exaggerate the internalinternal influence which we possessed or which we would wish to exercise in Persian affairs. 8. He spoke warmly of Schwartzkepf but took a poor view of the other members of the American Mission and thought that their presence was an additional cause for suspicion on the Russian side. I told him that when we had persuaded the Americans to send^nd the Persians to accept^the original Millspaugh Mission the idea had been that this was the only way in which Persia could receive foreign aid without arousing Russian suspicions, 9. Impression Ambassador gave me was that of a man who is willing and anxious to pay 'Danegeld' in the form of Azerbaijan so as to be free to develop what he regards as progressive policies in the rest of Persia.

After considering Foreign Office telegram to New York No: 2950 and the developments ending with your telegram to Washington No: 415, I shall be glad if you will make the following communication to the Persian Government. [Begins]* As the Persian Government know, it is contrary to the policy of His Majesty’s Government to interfere in Persia’s affairs. It is however only right that any Government should take what steps it considers necessary within its own territory to ensure order and security during elections and their proper conduct. His Majesty’s Government’s note from Mr. Le Rougetel's reports that the Persian Government have sent troops into Azerbaijan for that purpose, a decision which, as is indicated above, is the affair of the Persian Government. 'X- Hisr Bxr 8304 r 2 - 4B His Majesty's Government further note that in the opinion of the Persian Government, this action may lead to a situation in which the independence and integrity of Persia may he threatened. His Majesty's Government trust that that situation will not arise. But if it were to arise, that is to say if the independence and integrity of Persia were threatened as a result of the action new taken by the Persian Government, the Persian Government may rest assured that His Majesty's Government, in accordance with their consistent policy and with their obligations under the Charter, v/ould stand by the Persian Government in any efforts which the latter might make to ensure that Persian independence and integrity were respected* I should add that His Majesty’s Government regard it as essential in Persia’s own Interests that any military forces which the Persian Government send into Azerbaijan should refrain from any excesses or provocation.

If I am right in this, then there seems to be every advantage in telling the Persians that this would be our attitude, but clearly it ought to be said in such terms as would preclude them from asserting that they had been promised our help in advance of the event and had taken the plunge on the strength of this promise. If, on the other hand, we say nothing at all, the Persian Government, which is not a robust body, vail be very likely, as I suggested in my telegram No. 2895 L of 9 th December]_to think that we are no longer concerned about Persian independence. 2. I realise that there is a risk that any declaration to the Persians that our policy has not, (repeat not), changed may be interpreted by them as giving His Majesty's Government’s prior approval to any folly that their troops might commit in Azerbaijan This point can, however, I think, be covered separately in your reply to the Persian Ambassador. 5. I would therefore suggest that your reply to the Persian Ambassador should be on the following \ /lines.OUTWARD TELEGRAM * ^ •' . ! U.Oi A l w sf. 'f 5. ; 4B ; lines* 4. His Majesty’s Government note that the Persian Government have decided to send troops into Azerbaijan to ensure security during the elections and the proper conduct of the elections. They further note that in the opinion of the Persian Government this action may lead to a situation in which the independence and integrity of Persia may be threatened. His Majesty's Government are not prepared to express any view as to this possibility or to anticipate the precise line they would take in such a hypothetical event. But, as has been made abundantly clear in the past, it has always been the policy of His Majesty’s Government to do their best to see that Persia’s independence and iritegrity is respected and this is still their .policy. Meanwhile, His Majesty's Government regard it as essential in Persia’s own interests that any military forces which the Persian Government send into Azerbaijan should refrain from any excesses or prov.osation.OUTWARD TELEGRAM U 9 (, 4 &lt;J if_ kJ f [This telegram is of particular socWBT W -j retained hy the authorised recipient and not passed j A iii Cypher/OTP H ri .

The Persian .ambassador whom I saw here today at his request told me that the Soviet iimbassador in Tehran had recently seen the Persian Prime Minister. The Soviet ambassador had warned him in threatening tones that if troops were sent into Azerbaijan trouble would occur and that the Soviet Government would not be able to remain indifferent. Hussein Ala said he knew there had been a doubt whether His Majesty’s Government had been in favour of the Persian Government referring the matter to the Security Council unless and until trouble arose. Now, however, that it had been referred to the Security Council would His Majesty's Government support the Persian Government in the Security Council should trouble arise ? The Persian Government were sending troops into Azerbaijan on December 9th or 10th1 % - 2 - 2. I told the ijnbassedor that I could not give him an answer there and then.

It was a great pity we still thought in terms of 20 or 30 years ago and made no real effort to rally round us the progressive elements now springing up in Persia. These elements were not Communist. 7. I said we were ready to support any progressive element but thought he was inclined to exaggerate the internal-4- R 91 &lt;j lL 4R internal influence which we possessed or which we would wish to exercise in Persian affairs. 8. He spoke warmly of Schwartzkepf but took a poor view of the other members of the American Mission and thought that their presence was an additional cause for suspicion on the Russian side. I told him that when we had persuaded the Americans to send and the Persians to accept the original Millspaugh Mission the idea had been that this was the only way in which Persia could receive foreign aid without arousing Russian suspicions. 9. Impression Ambassador gave me was that of a man who is willing and anxious to pay ,, Danegeld ,, in the form of Azerbaijan so as to be free to develop v/hat he regards as progressive policies in the rest of Persia.

In view of our past efforts to support Persian independence, in particular at the London and New York meetings of the Security Council, complete silence on our part now is liable to lead Qavam to suspect that we are less concerned about Persian independence than we were, and indeed, the Persian mind being what it is, to suspect that we are preparing some deal with the Russians at Persia’s expense behind the back of the Persians and the ? Americans. I would therefore suggest that Mr. Le Rougetel should be given discretion to tell Qavam if and when he thinks it necessary to do so, that it is still, as in the past, our firm desire to see Persian 'irdependence respected.«Lt COPY ^sdexhd 'H 1-^ ?rV&gt;7 FM9 t O 7 7 i [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on* ] ^ /TR f Cypher/OTP CABINET DISTRIBUTION .

[Begins] 1. Your 1536 November 29th arrived 2 p.m. December 2nd. After examining it and your 1539 and 1540 December 1st and after studying British Ambassador's telegram on subject, which has been shown us by British Embassy, we are unable oO understand precisely what advice or assurance Qavam desires. We observe in his conversation with British Ambassador a shift in his position and a general weakening of his attitude vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. Matter so urgent, however, we feel we should give you our views without awaiting clarification. 2. It seems to us that Iranian Central Government is justified in taking appropriate measures, including the despatch of troops, in order to restore its authority in Azerbaijan. Ye do not see how valid elections can be held in Azerbaijan so long as that province is not under control of Central Government. /3.3. If Qavam should refrain froncjaking appropriate measures to restore authority of Central Government in Azerbaijan merely because of pressure brought to bear upon him by Soviet Ambassador, he will be adding to difficulties which we have been encountering in carrying out of policy of supporting integrity and independence of Iran 0 If, on the other hand, following despatch by Qavam of troops into Azerbaijan he should have reason to believe that Soviet Government is interfering in Iranian affairs by giving support to Azerbaijan movement and he should bring this matter to attention of Security Council, American Government will be prepared to pursue matter energeticallyo You can assure Qavam that this Government will give its unqualified support to Iran or to any other power the integrity or independence of which may be threatened by external forces, provided that power shows courage and determination to maintain its own independence and freedom of action and provided it is willing to make its position clear to you. 4. You may further inform Qavam that v/e feel he would be justified at this point in informing Security Council of situation with regard to Azerbaijan^ If he decides to do so, he might care to incorporate in his communication following points: (A) Iranian Central Government, despite protracted negotiations, has not as yet been able by peaceful means to reassert its authority over Azerbaijan. (B) He has therefore decided to send Iranian forces into Azerbaijan to supervise elections and to re-establish order and restore authority of Iranian Government; /(C)( 0 ) (D) -3- i He has taken this position notwithstanding a message delivered to him by Soviet Ambassador on behalf of Soviet Government to effect that if Central Government forces are sent to Azerbaijan there will be disturbances in that province and along Soviet border; His present communication to Security Council is in nature of further report of developments in Iranian question pending before Security Council and he hopes that in view of situation in Azerbaijan, Security Council will continue to be seized of Iranian question. 5. Such communication would not of course be considered as invitation to Security Council to act at this juncture. It would, however, place Security Council upon notice regarding possibility that Iranian case might again become active in immediate future* .. [Ends], Foreign Office please pass immediate to Tehran.

I do not feel able however to reopen the matter again with Mr.Byrnes, who has told me that he personally approves the instructions sent to the United States Ambassador, with a view to reaching identic views.

IMMEDIATE LIGHT My immediately preceding telegram. Article is headed: 'They wish to make Persia a war base against the Soviet Union.' Imperialism of America afraid of the failure of its plans seeks in every way to mislead the people of Persia on political and social questions. -The policy of Byrnes, Churchill, and Bevin is directed by the Eisenhowers and Montgomeries. American policy aims today at the military encirclement of the U.S.S.R. and the establishment of air, land and sea bases from which the U.S.S.R, can be attacked. Persia has a special importance for American warmongers. If they can establish air and military bases in Persia they can threaten directly the oilfields of the Caucasus and the factories of the Urals. The present so- called impartial Government of Persia has invited these enemies of our great and friendly neighbour to come from thousands of miles away and has placed the army and gendarmerie in their hands. The people of Russia suffered terribly in the last war. What reason have we to bring their enemies here to threaten them with new disasters?

Q Q Q SECRET IMPORTANT In the past ten days Soviet press accounts of reactionary terrorist attacks on M democratic ,f elements in Persia have increased significantly and tone has become shriller. In addition to previous reports (see latest weekly summary in my telegram No«3594) there were reports of tribesmen entering Zenjan, beating up workers and boasting that they would trample on Azerbaijan and Caucasus; terrorism in South Kurdistan including the hanging of many Kurd democrats; the recall from Pahlevi of all leading neutral officials; ’’alarming” reports of the release of the ’’notorious” General *rfa; the comment that the reign of terror dated from the formation of the Qawam cabinet of October 19th; and Pravda’s conclusion of December 1st that the present government does not intend or is unable to oppose the increasing pressure of reactionary ^oups and agents of foreign imperialism. It is interesting that Qawam has at no time been attacked or criticised personnally. 2. There has been no hint in the Soviet press of Soviet demarches either in Tehran or here, or of any threat to Soviet interests or security that might arise from disorder in Azerbaijan.

Repeated to Washington United Kingdom Delegation to Council of Foreign Ministers Bagdad Middle East Office Angora. 0 0 0 0 LIGHT My telegram No. 1889. _ As I have already reported Prime Minister told me last night that he did not expect developments in Azerbaijan to entail a postponement of elections. 2. This incident is of some interest since on November 30th Minister for Far informed Military Attache that Cabinet had decided to reply to latest Soviet intervention in the following sense. If forces were not sent into Azerbaijan to ensure order the conducting of elections will have to be postponed and in consequence legislation embodying Soviet-Persian “agreement” would be still further delayed. From Prime Minister’s remarks to me it would seem that Cabinet has taken no such decision. The telegram from Persiam Ambassador in Moscow which Prime Minister read to me last night contained inter alia a reference to impatience of Soviet Government with Prime /Minister'sMinister's delay in carrying out his promise to enact this legislation and an insistent demand for deeds instead of words, 3. While on the subject of elections Prime Minister also spoke of election prospects. In his view opinion has now moved against Tudeh to such an extent that itlls very doubtful whether they will obtain any seats at all in the new Majlis. I pointed out that any action v/hich could be construed as an attempt by him or his party to deprive any genuine body of opinion of all representation in the new Chamber was bound to make bad impression abroad. Moreover it such elements were forced underground he would be storing up serious trouble for himself and his party. The Prime Minister recognised the force of this argument and promised to give it careful consideration.

M OST IMMEDIATE . LIGHT. Foreign Office telegram No r 2451 to you# It is not clear from what the Prime Minister has sail to me or to the United States Ambassador (my telegrams Nos. 1882 and 1907) whether he intends to use force to overcome Azerbaijan resistance. As you will see from my telegram No. 1910 the Azerbaijanis have now made it clear that they intend to resist and fighting may therefore break out at any time, 2. The Persian Government may of course decide to notify the Security Council before their troops cross the border into Azerbaijan. Alternatively they may seek the Council 1 s prior approval and it still seems to me that if they do so they may be in a stronger position to deal with any difficulties which may then arise. Even if the Council were to decide that the matter is primarily one within Persian domestic jurisdiction they can hardly deny that civil war in Azerbaijan, if it occurr--, VJ| entail a sudden threat to international peace under Article 54 of the Charter especially as the matter is still on their agenda.3 # But even if the Council refused to admit the possibility of such a dangerous situation arising, the eventual position of the Persian Government vmuld surely be exactly the same as if they had merely notified the Council of their intention. 4. If the Council were to give prior approval as soon as it was sought, tne Persian Government would no doubt feel justified in taking a bolder line and in exploiting this opportunity to retain effective control of Azerbaijan before Russian counter-pressure has developed its full effect. On the other hand failing some such stimulus there is still a risk that Qavam 'may miss this bus.

The Persian Prime Minister is clearly in a very difficult position and we should give him our sympathy and any advice which we think would be useful to him. 2. Any attempt by the Persian Government to exert their authority in Azerbaijan in order to secure freedom of election may cause Soviet displeasure and possibly Soviet intervention which the Security Council, on whose agenda the Persian case still is, might have to consider. From the point of view of the Persian Government’s position vis-A-vis both the Soviet Government and the Security Council, it therefore seems desirable that they should notify (repeat notify) the Security Council of what they are doing. The Persian PrimeOUTWARD TELEGRAM - 2 - Prime Minister and Mr. Le Rougetel therefore seem to he thinking in general on the right lines. It seems doubtful however whether it is necessary for Persian Government to seek prior approval of Security Council in a matter which can clearly be represented as falling within their own domestic jurisdiction and they might indeed court a rebuff if they did so. But they would by prior notification be in a stronger position if difficulties arose when their troops actually entered Azerbaijan, and if Soviet Government made difficulties in Security Council at the time of notification, Persian Government would at least have forced Soviet Government into the open. 3. We recommend therefore that Mr. Le Rougetel should be instructed to speak to the Persian Prime Minister in the sense of the foregoing paragraph and to repeat to the Shah what he has said to the Prime Minister, if he considers it useful to do so. 4.

Mr. ttllen enquired whether the Prime Minister had decided to appeal to U.N.O. and if so what form the appeal would take. The Prime Minister explained that he intended to despatch 500 troops to the Russian Frontier and another 500 to the line of communication with that frontier. If, as was probable, the Azerbaijanis opposed the entry of these troops by force an appeal to U.N.O. would be made. When Mr. Allen reminded the Prime Minister of his statement to the Security Council last April that all outstanding issues between Persia and Soviet Union had been settled, the Prime Minister said that he intended to make out an entirely fresh case on /the- 2 - the grounds that outbreak of hostilities in Azerbaijan would endanger international peace, 3 # Mr, xJlen [grp,undec, ? and I have] both received reliable information to the effect that the Soviet Ambassador was received yesterday by the Shah, He was also received by the Prime Minister on the same day notwithstanding the fact that exactly two days ago he was recovering from an extremely serious operation in the Soviet hospital where the Prime Minister visited him.

Dear Department, Tabriz telegram No. 30b of October 3rd, which we repeated to you, gave you an idea of the efforts which the authorities in Tabriz are making to prevent open strife with the Kurds of Azerbaijan. Subsequent reports from Carse indicate that Qazi Muhammad has lost whatever influence he may once have had outside Mahabad and that the Kurds of the Rszaiyah area are extorting large subsidies from Tabriz as the price of peace. There is evidently no enduring cohesion among the various Kurdish tribal chiefs and the One idea which they hold in common is to maintain tribal independence. Yours ever.

He estimated that including about 700 Fidais democrats have approximately 2,000 effectives in Shahpur. 5, He proposes to lodge complaint with Acting GovernoiMGeneral and Pishavari at treatment accorded to him by Daneshian and to ask: ”Who is governing authority in Azerbaijan”.

Congress elected as Honorary president Louis Saillant, Secretary of World Federation of Trade Unions, now visiting Tabriz, and as Honorary Member of Executive Committee, Kuznetsoff, Vice-president of World Federation of Trade Unions. 2. Louis Saillant, accompanied by about fifteen leaders of Trade Unions from Near Eastern countries, arrived in Tabriz by air yesterday. At a meeting in the National Square attended by most of the factory workers of Tabriz, he made what a Frenchman present described as a moderate and sensible speech but one above the heads of his audience. He assured the workers that the Trade Unions of the world and especially those of their 'Northern neighbour' would support them inj 552 I 4 „b - 2 - their struggle for better conditions and said that if Iranian workers remained united he was sure that reaction would never recover its power. He does not appear to have visited any factories and is due to leave Tabriz for Tehran to-day. 3. Sadiq Dadar, Chief of Police at ^rdebil and formerly Chief of Security (Secret) Police here and for a time Chief of Police in Azerbaijan, was shot dead at Ardebil a few days ago. Memorial services were held here for him yesterday and to-day. Official version is that death was accidental, but there is a suspicion that he was liquidated by Democrat authorities, perhaps for having had a hand in Muhajir opposition to Pishavari. Dadar was himself a gunman and confessed murderer.• / / &amp; n r : 7 «. f [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should bo retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on.J iMi) [CYPHER ] CABINET DISiRIBUTION : oORV FROtifTEHRAN TO'' FOREIGN OFFICE NO. idlo BAGDAD ' Mr. Le Rougetel, 13th July’ BRITISH MIDDLE EAST OFFICE.

Since that time, many changes have taken place in Tehran which have brought us nearer to the Central Government ana Qavam has taken necessary action to render the reactionaries harmless. The first problem that had to be settled was the division of Khalisa lands among the people. As you .aiow, there is nothing in our constitutional law against this procedure. The first thing Qavam diu was to legalise this division. The second problem, which was still more important, was the problem of our language. Thanks to Qavam's help, we can now read ana write in our own language. This means a great deal to us. The people should ^now that we are Iranians at heart, and the language, whet lie r Turk! or Persian, cannot alter this fact. ,Va will use our own language but Persian will remain the official language of Iran. Third Problem: The nomination of members of government departments. Hereafter the members of government aepartments will be chosen by the Provincial Council, subject to the approval of the Central Government. ,/e must be thannful for having been able to secure these rights without a fratriciaal war, although we have made many sacrifices for our cause. Here, I nave to asn you to stand up and keep one minute*s silence in memory of the patriots who gave up their lives for the cause Fourth Problem: The problem of revenue, previous governments useu to send the entire revenue to Tehran, and there was no money in Azerbaijan for the welfare of the people. How, we have 75 ,0 of our revenue to spena on this province, for builaing schools, hospitals ana whatever else we need. Here, I have to say that our revenue is not sufficient and we must try and increase it in future. How I must repeat what the reactionaries say. Some of them say that Qavam has deceives the democrats and others that he gave in to them because he wanted to remain in power. These foreign reactionaries should know that no^ they can no longer interfere with the independence of Iran. Qavam ana I found that the Democrat Party was necessary for the preservation of the country and whatever foreigners say will go unheeded. I seize this opportunity to say a word about Zandjan and Kiiamse province. I ao not nnow the reason why the Central Government iias separated this province from Azerbaijan. file language of its inhabitants is Tu.rivi and tney are similar to Azerbaijanis in every respect, their customs, their traditions etc. , are a lk-e. ,/hen the Democrat Party i- 2 - began its work in Azerbaijan, anotiier aemocrat party appeared in Zanajan and they began to fight against the reactionaries without interfering with the work of our party. After lengthy negotiations, Muzzafar Firuz informed me in an official letter that the Zandjan Democrat Party would be allowed to continue its activities unhindered. When the people of Afhar and Zandjan gathered in the Telegraph Office 2 days ago, I advised them to remain in peace and go about their business, because the Azerbaijan Democrat Party would not allow anyone to take action against the Zandjan Democrat party. I hope Qavam will change his mina and will not separate Zandjan from Azerbaijan. The last and most important thing I have to speak to you ab&gt;DUt is the election of the IJth Parliament. You have to bear in mind that our freedom and all our newly acquired rights depend on the outcome of these elections. We have to succeed in these elections. If we fail, and if the reactionaries should seize power, we should have to seize our weapons and fight them all over again. (Here, pointing to the map of Iran, Pishevari exclaims) 'We must do our best for this country and I hope that we shall succeed. Long live Azerbaijan and its Democrat Party, which is the pioneer of freedom in Iran!”V\QN/ a [This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be retained by the authorised recipient and not passed onj ./V ** % K.

Pishavari yesterday informed the presiding committee of Azerbaijan National Assembly of 15 point agreement reached with TehJiso Delegation and tended his resignation as Prime Minister. Presiding committee approved agreement but asked Pishavari to remain in office until agreement is ratified both by the plenary session of the National Assembly and by the central Majlis. Pishavari has presumably agreed to do so. 2. Agreement as broadcast last night appears to grant Azerbaijan substance of its main demands but although there appears to be agreement in principle on the two fundemental questions of the Army and the Provincial Council, problem of appointment of Army and Gendarmerie Lgp* omitted] has been deferred for settlement by a joint commission while the powers and functions of the Provincial Council into which the present Notional Assembly will be converted seem to &gt;q\ depend on a law which it is proposed to submit to the next central Majlis. There is a possible opportunity for further /bargaining on these two points and perhaps for whittling down /the/V v - 2 - the effective locel tutonomy which agreement concedes. 3) as agreeaent provides that the Governraent General shall be nouinc ted by the Provincial Council this point has not the same importance.

He said that there-had been an exchange of telegrams, that so far no^ecision had been reached but M. Pishavari’s general [?gp. omitted] had become more conciliatory of late. In view of the Government’s decision to draft a^land reform bill prior to^elections (see my telegram No. 759), I asked for further information and particularly how this decision could be reconciled with Prime Minister.’ s statement to me that such a matter was beyond the competence of present Government (see my telegram No. 691). I alscf asked whether decision had any direct bearing^on renewal of discussions with Pishavari, The Prime Minister was distinctly evasive but^gave.me to understand that it would he possible for such a law to-be enacted and even applied subject to ratification by the new Majlis, 2 ./2.

Repeated to Foreign Office NCo4 Sa vinga My telegram NOol94, paragraph 2, At a meeting of the Democrat Party on May 13th Pishavari made a statement on the recent negotiations with Qavam as Saltaneh. His speech was translated into Persian and broadcast by Tabriz r.adio 0 After reviewing the history and aims of the liberal movement in Azerbaijan since the Occupation in 1941 Pishavari said that the Azerbaijan Delegation had found Qavam's attitude towards their movement reasonable and they had had good hopes of reaching agreement with him* Some reactionary ministers in Qavam’s cabinet, however, being under the influence of H certain other quarters' 5 had put pressure on the Prime Minister to prevent him agreeing to Azerbaijan proposals. Pishavari said that Azerbaijan was prepared to accept some of Qavam's seven points, but they could not agree to Tehran's appointing either the Governor-General or the commanders of the army in Azerbaijan^ Pishavari*s argument on these two points was that the Governor-General should be an Azerbaijani appointed by the Provincial Council with the approval of Tehran, and that, as the Azerbaijan Army was not a regular national army but only a security force intended solely for home defence, the commanders should be locally appointed. He contended that it was wrong to make the elections for the new Central Majlis dependent on a settlement of the /Azerbaijan- 2 - Azerbaijan question, and demanded that this question be treated independently of both the Majlis elections and the Oil Concession. He concluded by declaring that Azerbaijan still hoped for a peaceful settlement and was ready to negotiate again, but not on a basis of acceptance of Qavam*s seven points en bloc. 2. A telegram was sent from the meeting to Qavam expressing appreciation of his understanding attitude but deploring the attitude of reactionary ministers and declaring that a united Azerbaijan would resist to the last drop of blood the efforts of these reactionaries to destroy its freedom.GOPY (a W4/104/34) f’ British Consulate-General Tabriz. — &gt; EXT (Hay loth., 1946.

And in this connection that Azerbaijan should be governed by the national organisations. The government of Tehran did not wish to give facilities for Eqbal Malekmadani and Samsam Bakhtiari in the matter of The Government described as legal the Gendarmerie organisation which is fundamentally opposed to the fundamental law and want to send back the savage band of this illegal force once again to Azerbaijan, to expand it and to destroy the national forces, and insisted that the Chiefs of Conscription and other military departments should be sent from Tehran. We know what opinion the people of Azerbaijan have of these woollen , heroes, who put on officers* uniforms and who showed their real character on the 3 rd of Shahrivar, and we know, too. that the sons of Satar Khan do not tolerate the sight (?) of these Colonels. For this reason we rejected the proposals of those people in this connection and insisted that some representatives should come from the Government to Azerbaijan so that this matter may be solved in accordance with the desires of both sides and we specially mentioned that the troops of Azerbaijan should not be abolished. If Tehran really considers the Azerbaijanis as Iranians, they should appoint in command of the forces those people whom we want. But this question was not satisfactory to them. Those people consider the government to be a government of Tehran and they wanted to make us understand that the Commander in Chief of the forces would not give permission; that now we should see the Commander of the Forces in accordance with the Constitution. * Reza Khan made use of this same command and created his dictatorship from this, and Iran fell into that state which we all know. how the holding of the Chief Command is completely contrary to freedom. If responsible circles continue along these lines, serious events will happen which will end to the detriment of Iran. Therefore, when we saw this, we decided that before this shall happen, we should not remain in Tehran. They want to turn the cities of Iran into graveyards and to make the people prisoners of oppression and unfortunately they have made use of the fundamental law and the other laws to arrive at their cruel desires. Here it is not only the question of Azerbaijan; the question is that freedom and democracy must rule throughout Iran. What has upset the reactionaries of Tehran and the great landlords of Tehran is that this people (the people of Azerbaijan) are striding to establish the rights of the people of Iran. We are honest people, but our honesty is not such that we should not provide a half bowl under a bowl. Some of the reactionary papers of Tehran which are tools of the reactionary elements tried to conceal these matters in the eyes of the people of Iran. We cannot be unmindful of the good-will and patriotism of Mr. Qawam-es-Saltaneh. We wish that all the reforms which we have carried out should be put into effect through the whole of Iran but if the course of events is perhaps not in accordance with the wishes of Mr. Qawam, this work may fall on us. Tehran also must take step© to save the nation from disturbances. Qawam-es-Saltaneh must know that the world has changed and even in Iran a new race has grown up and this race cannot be governed on the principles and methods of thoughts of a century ago. Apart from that, among the members of this cabinet there is no agreement of views and actually Mr. Qawam has invited most of the ministers to friendly relations and each one of them • It is even rumoured that sane of the ladies have influence on the work of the government. Tehran is the centre and dangerous which is driving the people of Iran to misfortune, /andand poverty. And at the same time that we are supporters of peace and the integrity of the soil of Iran we cannot hope for salvation from Tehran. The cabinet of Mr. Qawarn- es-Saltaneh, if it were able to last, would come to an agreement with the people of Azerbaijan. Unfortunately up to this day they have not taken any step and our loyalty was a great fortune for the cabinet of Mr. (^awam. But unfortunately they were not able to take advantage of this. I am confident that the personal views of some members of the cabinet had deep effect on the behaviour of Mr. Qawam, e.g. the law of prohibiting opium in Azerbaijan, which is an old enemy of ours. But in the end we returned to Azerbaijan without any result but the government of Tehran must not forget that the people of Azerbaijan were not and cannot be ready for more sacrifices than this and we request the government of Tehran to respect sincerely the desires of Azerbaijan. But in spite of all this we do not despair of solving the difficulties in a peaceful way and we will keep this peace and we shall take no steps against it, but they must know that coming to Azerbaijan with arms is inflammable. We know that Mr. Qawam is wiser than to act in this dangerous way. If it should so happen, our people, men and women, great and small, will rise up as one soul. Long live Azerbaijan, the standard-bearer of the freedom of Iran. Long live the people which has opened the gates of freedom to the people of Iran.[EN CLAIR] file copy x SECRET f kxt CABINET DISTRIBUTION Mr. Le Roagetel, ^ No. 7U 25th May 194.6 FROM TEHRAN TO FOREIGN OFFICE V D. 4.47 p.m. 4.47 p.m. 25th May 1946 R. 6.32 p.m. 25th May 1946 'Rej)£ated -to; Moscow Washington New York for Sir A&lt;, Cadogan Government of India 1.

After referring to previous oral state^nts concerning the evacuation, the Ambassador informs the Persian Government that the Soviet evacuation of Persia was completed, according to a plan drawn up by the Caucasian General Staff, by the 9th May. This official notification corroborates reports which had previously reached the Persian Government and which were in turn confirmed by the report of the Commission sent to Azerbaijan. Therefore 4 the Persian Government now-consider that Persian territory is completely and officially cleared of all British, Soviet and American troops and material. 3. In reply to correspondents' questions, Firuz also said, although no appointment or decision had yet been made, a 2. Further to reports received from the Commission sent Commission /Commission will soon be sent to Tabriz and by virtue of the goodwill which the Persian Government attribute to the Azerbaijaniahs, an early settlement is anticipated. b-* The statement made by M.

No instructions authorising them have been sent to him and indeed he has been instructed by the Prime Minister to refrain from making such statements in future. Nothing can be said about his recall, 5* All railways have been handed over by the Russians. 6. The Government's 7-point programme proposed to the Azerbaijanians is not a surrender but an adaptation of demands to the exigencies of the case and an effort to reconcile them with existing laws.

Cadogan Paris Conference Saving IMMEDIATE Following is summary of speech broadcast by Pishavari after his return to Tabriz. The Nationalist movement in Azerbaijan has freed the people of the province from the oppression of corrupt officials and from the tyranny of gendarmerie. Azerbaijanis are Persians and wish to remain within Persia but they cannot surrender the liberties which they have won with so many sacrifices. Since the National Government has been formed Government lands have been distributed to peasants, factories opened and education health services improved, and above all nationals forces have been established. These things have proved the competence of the regime. We cannot give up all these things into the hands of the incompetent officials of Tehran. Qavam al Sultana has changed the policy of force but he will not depart from his seven points because he says that the Constitution does not permit him to do so. The peopler’ &gt;7 ‘2' l .7* » v. JO J of Azerbaijan made the present Constitution and if necessary they can make another. He was ready to convert the National Government into a Provincial Council and to recommend officials to be appointed by the Central Government but the Government would not agree c The Government wanted to send back the hated gendarmes into Azerbaijan, to destroy the National forces of the Province to send in Conscription Inspectors and other Military Departments from Tehran. I resisted these proposals and decided to return from Tehran. We cannot be unmindful of the goodwill and patriotism of Qavam but what the reactionaries dislike is our efforts to establish the rights of the people throughout the whole of Persia. If Qavam will not carry out the necessary reforms the task may fall upon us. Qavam must understand that the world has changed and that the people of to-day cannot be governed by the methods of a century ago. The present Government of Tehran is driving the people to misery, hunger and poverty. Our conversations in Tehran reached no results but Tehran must know that we will not make any more concessions. We intend to keep the peace but let them be warned against attacking us. . If they do every man, woman and child in Azerbaijan will rise against them. Long live the Azerbaijanis, the people who have opened the gates of freedom for Persia. Full translation by bag.

'At this moment when public opinion await with attention the outcome of the discussions between the Government and the representatives from Azerbaijan I consider it necessary to inform the public of the result of the discussions which have taken place during the last fifteen days by making clear the facts in the public mind. It is clear to the representatives of the people of Azerbaijan who came to Tehran that I made the necessary effort with the best intentions and a peaceful attitude to solve the problems under discussion and that I en deavoured to meet the demands of the representatives from Azerbaijan within the limits of the existing laws of the country. After the declaration of 1 Urfljbihisht 1525 (repeat 1 Urdibihisht 1525) (21st April 1946) had been issued and the Government's seven point decree published- 2 - published certain AR[sic] circles protested against it and thought that my policy had exceeded the existing laws of the country® Although I trusted and still trust the good intentions of the representatives from Azerbaijan as a result of the discussions which have taken place during the last fifteen days I am sorry to say that some of their demands were outside the scope of the legal powers and the seven point declaration of the Government and for this reason the discussions have of necessity been postponed until a solution is found and the representatives from Azerbaijan have returned to Tabriz® 5® The demands of the representatives of the people of Azerbaijan which differed from the legal powers and the seven point declaration of the Government are as follows (1) In accordance with Article 2 of the Government’s declaration dated 1 Urdibihist 1525 (21st April 1946) the appointment of a Governor General for Azerbaijan will be made by the Government taking into consideration the views of the provincial council. The representatives from Azerbaijan insisted that the selection of a Governor General should be made on the proposal of the provincial council and the appointment then made by the Government. (2) In accordance with Article 2 of the Government's declaration dated 1 Urdibihisht 1525 (21st April 1946) the appointment of officers commanding military and gendarmeriegendarmerie forces will be made by the Government, The representatives from Azerbaijan were of opinion that the above mentioned officers should be appointed on the proposal of the provincial council and the appointments then approved by the Government. The distribution of public domains and ceded properties among the peasants which took place during the recent changes in Azerbaijan should be confirmed oy the Majlis in accordance with the existing laws and the adoption of decision of the Government on this subject is outside the scope of the legal powers of the Government. The above mentioned questions and other problems were discussed but since the Majlis should take the decision on most of these problems therefore without any decision being taken for the present, the representatives from Azerbaijan returned to Tabriz to submit a report and to receive further instructions. 4. Because with the best of peaceful intentions I desire to find a solution for these problems it is obvious that I shall be prepared to continue the discussions and to find a solution for these difficulties through the adoption of a policy which does not differ from the laws of the country. 5. Since in accordance with the stipulations of the law and taking into consideration- the Government's undertaking about oil in mhe north in accordance with agreements exchanged with the Soviet Government the fifteenthfifteenth Majlis should convene within seven months of the date of the signature of the above mentioned agree ments. The rescript for the general elections must be announced as soon as possible. 6. I expect that the representatives from Azerbaijan will provide the facilities necessary to enable the Government to announce the general elections in accordance with the stipulations of the laws and to enable the people of Azerbaijan to elect their representatives freely and to send them to the capital 7o I hope that the good intentions and patriotism which I feel among the representatives from Azerbaijan will prove sufficient to relieve the anxiety felt by the public and that taking into consideration the legal duties of the Government the present differences will be resolved on all counts)’’. 8.

IMMEDIATE, oOo 0 . 2 . • After a false start yesterday the Azerbaijani delegation left for Tabriz by air this morning. No agreement has been reached. 2. I received this information from the Prime Minister when paying his first official call this morning. M. Qawam gave Mr. Allen to understand that during the concluding stages of the discussions the Soviet Ambassador was supporting the stand made by the Azerbaijani delega tion. This seems to dispose of various unconfirmed reports to the contrary, which were circulating here at the end of last week. 3. Mr 0 Allen told me that, while deprecating the use of force, he went out of his way to impress on the Prime Minister the importance of maintaining a robust and independent attitude. In particular he urged him to issue a clear and comprehensive statement without delay. He had made it plain however that in his opinion no useful purpose would be served by a further appeal to the Security Council, unless M. Qawam was prepared to furnish full documentary information and to stand up for himself and his country no matter what pressure might be brought to boar upon him from any quarter. He told me this in strictest. e • • «2 strictest confidence and I felt bound to say that in the present circumstances these conditions seemed to me Utopian. He did not disagree but said that if the Persian Government appealed they would, unless they were prepared to stick to their guns, merely be forfeiting the sympathy and support of his Government. I told him that I had been careful to avoid proffering advice in any quarter which could be construed as an invitation to the Persian Government to make further appeal to U.N.O. On the other hand I said that I had more than once suggested the desirability of a public statement when the time was ripe. 4. According to Mr. Allen it is the Prime Minister’s intention to issue a full statement very shortly.

R» 10,23 a.m, 7th May, 191-6, ///// M OST IMMEDIATE Following received from Tabriz telegram No, 182 of May 6 th. [Begins], In tour of Tabriz this morning I did not see single Russian soldier in uniform or a single Russian military vehicle. At the station however I saw several members of the Russian [grp.undec: ?railway] corps. It is said that 10?o of the railway personnel have been left behind, I saw no Russian military material in goods yard. 2. Soviet town commandant's office and general staff building are occupied by Azerbaijan troops. Houses of G.O.C. and Major General Atakishev (Chief Political Officer) are apparently empty. 3. My personal observations are confined to Tabriz as deliberate obstruction by democrat authorities has prevented my touring the province but from the best information I can get myself evacuation is complete. There is some doubt about Eenjan since there are no reports 01 tanks having withdrawn6. - 2 - 4. Ido not think the Russians have left any important war material with Azerbaijan army except small arms and a few jeeps and lorries at-least in Tabriz. I have seen no field or anti-tank guns with local army lately, whereas up to about April 25th I saw them almost every day. I believe consistent reports that Russians took back guns, to be true. As regards instructors, according to informant until recently holding important position in the democrat Party only [grp. undec: /5] remain with Azerbaijan Army and they are probably going. iviajor Hassanov who was Atakishev’s assistant has not been seen for three days. 5. I believe some Red ^rmy Officers have been locally discharged and are now employed in such organisations as the Soviet transport and oil companies. It is also not impossible 3X3° ■ that among the Muhajirs (see my telegram No. 175) in local government there may be some Soviet citizens of Turkish race. My own impression is, however, that although the Russians were prepared to use their own and local forces to obtain their demands up to mid-April and had strengthened their garpison and accelerated training of Azerbaijan army to this end the outcome of negotiations with Tehran Government later enabled them to dispense with this plan. I do not believe that the Azerbaijan Army has either the equipment or the will to fight but the Azerbaijan Government is encouraged by Russian moral support and the fact that Julfa is only 90 miles from Tabriz.4 -3- 'V 6.

After some delay due to the elusiveness of the Prime Minister I succeeded in informing his Deputy on April 26th of my intended visit to Rezaieh. As I had received no reply hy the morning of April 27th I set off without a pass. I was held up at Khoi and telegraphed to the Prime Minister through the Governor of the town asking for facilities. They were refused. I returned the same day and on April 28th personally protested to the Acting Prime Minister and requested pass. The Acting Prime Minister while not refusing point blank has by evasion tactics withheld the pass and I am therefore obliged to put off another attempt to visit Rezaieh until Lang’s return from leave. 2. A reply v/hich I have at length received to my first communication states my request for travelling facilities must be made in official form. I have hitherto followed the instructions contained in your telegram No. 42,/....- 2 - No, 42 of 1945 and communicated with the autonomous authorities either verbally or by personal letters addressed to officials by name, but it is clear from my interview with the Acting Prime Minister as well as from the reply just received that the autonomous authorities are reciprocating my refusal to recognise them officially by withholding all facilities that they can.
