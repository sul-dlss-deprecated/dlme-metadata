Political Agent The Agency, Manama Subject Pear Sir, In late TTo^ember'rwe-€arly Peceinber of last year i.e. approximately 10 monuhs ago, I purchased a Pord car from the local agents Messrs Kanoo at the controlled rate. Prom other purchasers of cars at the controlled Dollar rate I understand that there is a regulation to the effect tnat a car so purchased ^ may not be re-s^ld without permission within the period of one^ year from date of purchase, and that owners are presently signing an agreement to that effect. Whilst I was never requestei to sign such an agreement I am nevertheless anxious to comply with whatever regulation is in effect and accordingly request your Consideration of the following: I am presently preparing to proceed on leave, training a relief etc , and altho T the date is as yet not definioely scheduled it seems likely that it will be sometime in December since I am desirous of being home for Christmas, I do not think that I shall be returning to Bahrein but irrespective of whether or hot I do return the anticipated expenses of my leave make it necessary that I sell my car lefore departure. Yhilst I can if essential wait until my year’s ownership of the car has matured and then sell,since this would be only a very short time before I hope to leave this might possibly entail selling in a hurry possibly to the first applicant with attendant disadvantages. \\ I should therefore like to make enquiries at leisure in the next u few weeks and in the event that an'’attractive offer'* be made 1 effect the sale. In view therefore of the circumstances outlined \ and particularly in view of the short time remaining to complete a year’s ownership I request your agreement to this procedure. Kindly advise, Yours very truly,' •• k •VjO» We beg to refer you to our letter of 2nd* May,1943, in which we requested for a ’’Purchase Permit' ©f a car from Messrs* Sbrahim Alajaji Co* We regret we were not fortunate enough in obtaining same* As Messrs Ebrahim Alajaji &amp; Co. have received another lot of cars, we once again beg to apply for a Purchase Permit ©f a car from this lot.

The 1947 quota was distributed as follovjs:- I Ford Sedan and 4 Fopd Trucks - H.E. the Ruler of Qatar. 4 Five Fprds were distributed to the Trucial .Coast as Follows:- 1. to Mr. G.N. Jackson, P.O.T.C. 1. to Jasim bin Mahmood, Residency Agent, Sharjah. 1. to Shaikh Rashid bin Huraaid, Ruler-of Ajraan. 1. to Shaikh Said bin Maktum, Ruler ofDubai. 1. to Shaikh Mohd. bin Ahmad bin Sulaiman, Shaikh of Hokha T re total number of Ford vehicles including balance of 1946 quota was 31 of which Ford Vehicles has been allotted so far. The quota of 1947 i.e., 17 vehicles, has been consumed, but there still remains a balance of Ford Vehicles from the 1946 quota which are still awaited. ii e should write to Messrs. K.E. Kanoo asking him to report * further on the despatch of these from the States. The sura of 31 vehicles includes the 2 Ford Trucks just allotted to II • ii • HUDSONS. - Quota foi* 1947 - 7. Agents Messrs. Yousuf A. Fakhro&lt; A balance of 6 remained from 1946 quota. This gives us a total .of 13 Hudsons. It will be observed from the priority , list of Hudsons that these cars have all been allotted. H pc 81 NASH - Quota* 6 for 1947 Agents, Messrs. Yusuf Ahmad Kanoo. These cars have been allotted as follows:- 1. The Branch Manager, A.I.O.C. muharraq. 2. The Political Agent, Kuwait.. 2. The Agents, one to be used for his mail contract and the other for Naval contract. BUICK - Quota 3 (Agents. Messrs. A. Alajaji and Sons). * 1 IrT 0ctober~1947^S. 200) we informed the Agents that they could utilisetj the balance from their allotment of dollars to import 3 Buicks for the import of another JBuick for Shaikh Mohammed bin Isa A1 Khalifah. • This made a total 9 f 4 Buick cars. Three of them have been allotted as folloiys:- 1. Shaikh Mohd bin Isa A1 Khalifah. 1. Dhamanmal Isardas 1. Shaikh Salman bin Mohd A1 Khalifah.^/. &lt; 2 -- ^ The fourth Buick which is still awaited has been allotted to Shaikh Khalifah bin Hamad A1 Khalifah. S.208 refers STUDBBAKHR - Quota of 5 for 1947 Agents. Messrs. Hussein Yateem. Two Pick-ups and 2 Studebaker Trucks have so far arrived and they have been allotted as follows:- 1. Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohd. A1-Khalifah. 1. Mr. Rodstrom, Resident Manager, ARAMCO. 2. Trucks have not yet been allotted. Of these four that have arrived, oae . Mr. Rodstrom paid in dollars 1 and the Agents A were informed that the next car bought by these dollars would be considered as a controlled dollar car. We might therefore consider that 3 cars have been imported with I a balance of 2 Studebakers still available. 1 DODGK/CRYSLSR/DH SOTO/BTC. Quota 3 for 1947. I Agents. Messrs. A.R. Algosaibi. A De-Soto-5 was imported and allotted to Shaikh Ahmad bin Hamad A1 Khalifah. One Dodge recently imported is being utilised by the Agents on the presumption that it has been allotted to them - We have not yet made this allocation and are awaiting his dollar expenditure on the quota for 1947. One more De-Soto 7 or 9 is expected shortly, which is to be allotted to Shaikh Mohd bin Isa A1 Khalifah !o 1 r 1 . &lt;=1 1/3 ■ 11 ■II \'l' CHriVRQLtiT - Quota 10 for 1947. Agents. Messrs. K.A. Alajaji and Sons. None of these cars have so far been imported into Bahrain and we should insist upon the import of /fcext. whiie dollar cars. I understand he has been, in a regular flow, importing Black Market Dollar cars (Chevrolet). Should further supplies of Black Market dollar Chevrolets arrive we should insist that they be converted into White Dollar cars and allotted by the Agency. v336/106-III 2 !&lt;&gt; : P ara 37 .

The details concerning Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohd (Suptd of Police), is as follows:- In October, 1946, he wrote a letter to Capt. Ranee (S.162-?.36/106 Vol-i) requesting him to register his own name for a Ford car in place of his brother Shaikh Salman bin Mohd, who was already on the list for Ford cars in 1946 - Shaikh Salman had received a Buick (Sovt Dollar) and was not therefore interested in a Ford car any more. Please also see N/Para 212 of same file. In September 1947 the P.A. wrote to Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohd. It was understood that he was already in possession of a Govt. Humber car and P.A. asked him to confim whether he still required the Ford Car/ he had been registered for. 3.163 vol-ii of same file refers. According to the reply by Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohd (S.180-vol4i) he had apparently spoken to P.A. who had agreed that he should consult Kanoo,and, if Kanoo could supply a convertable coupe (wooden body) without requiring more Govt, dollars and without reducing the number of Ford cars already ordered through him (Kanoo), he could take delivery of the Ford Coupe when it arrived./S, /&amp;!&gt; £e 7 ^ 5 . ? ^ ‘se.
