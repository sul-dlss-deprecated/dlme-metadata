Group-Captain MacLean has expressed himself as very grateful for the assistance given to him in his attempt to establish landing grounds and re-fuelling stations on the Dhufar-Kas al Hadd Coast ( of which work he is, as you know in charge,and for the hospitality and assistance given to Rickards during his recent visit to Muscat and Has al Hadd. , 1 He has asked me to explain that he is very anxious that his 1 operations shall not interfere with your political work on the Oman Coast^nd he was disappointed to hear recently from the Air Ministry of the punitive action recently taken at Sur and contemplated against the Amir of Ja’alan in Baled Beni Ali. It would be of great assistance to him if from time to time he could be given information y through us ,of the development of the political situation as between the Sultan of Muscat and the Amir of Ja’alan. In the meantime we shall take an opportunity of Murphy’s calling at Aden on his way home this month^of getting our information in that respect up to date. Referring to Murphy's D.O.letter No.37-C of the 21st March 1930paragraph 2, in regard to work at Masirah Major T. C. Fowle, C.B.EIsland^the Sultan of Muscat considered that our best course would be to cultivate friendly relations with the Shaikh v of Masirah in the first instance. It appears from Thomas’s letter, which he enclosed, that the Shaikh of Masirah is Sa*id bin Ali whose authority is delegated from the paramount Janabah Shaikh, Sa’id bin Sultan* It is not quite clear to us whether in any future visit to Masirah we should be justified in dealing direct with either one or the other ; nor is it known to us whether the Amir of .3a ’ alan stated in Thomas’s letter to be the Shaikh of the Eastern Janabah/(as a paramount authority that would include control over Masirah. In any case, and notwithstanding the Sultan of Muscat's advice quoted by Murphy^we understand from Rickards that any direct relations with the Chiefs on the littoral would run counter to His Highness's wishes and to your policy in 'Muscat. irerhaps you would be good enough to make these points clear to us* A* V ' /C 7 ic. , £.■+&lt;+.■4No ^ u&gt; ■- /T 5 THE KE3IDE1TGY, Aden, ^ ' June 1930* Prom The Resident and Commander-in-Chief, Aden.

We only found a few fishermen there who gave ue a cc J r * dial welcome. There was ho one of any authority on the island and i was informed that the Sheikh (Said bin Sultan bin Khamls) was on the mainland at Ammar, and that he Vxaited the island now and then. They also acknowledge the authority cf All Abdullah, Amir of Ja*alan. It was the opinion of the representative of the Sultan of i/iuscat at jaurbat that there would be no objection to making a landing ground on the island on the part of the Sheikh provi ded he had orders from the Sultan. I am of opinion that a landing ground could be constructed at aoy time esj-e*. ialx^ if the constructing party brougnt with them a few luxuries for the inhabitants in the shape of coffee, sugar and rice-* s/L Betts will be submitting a report on the possibilities of a landing ground and sea-plane base from the uoyal Air force point i f yxj&amp;j view. Ad Dawwe consists of 40 or 50 huts constructed of palm branches and a mud-built building which serves as a mosque, fishing is the chief industry of the inhabitants who are poor. They export shark fins and import dates and rice. re only passed two villages on our way to Ad Pawwa, one called Halaf near the Northern end with a hill of the same name and the other, Adhfiad, about half way between Halaf and Ad Dawwa. On our return to the ship, Commander Garatin sent off a bag of flour, a bag of rice and about 15 tine of ship's biscuit for the inhabitants. V.e reached jturbat at about 7 a.m. on 4th May. The repres entative of the :;u 1 tan, Ahmed bin ? sent eff a boat immediately we anchored, with his chief slave, to ask the reason for our visit. On my replying that we had called to pay our respects, we were made*welcome. We were rowed ashore after breakfast and received by the representative of the Sultan and the Sheikh of kurbat, Ali Muhammed and led to a bench outside his houss wners coffee and S7;eetmeat was served. There was a picturesque gathering oi tne inhabitants, and bedouins from the interior. We subsequently proceeded to inspect the landing ground and on return to the snip, the representative and the sheikh with certain relations and the ^adhi, cane off with us. c-ommander uaratin served tnem with coffee and shewed them round the ship. We were given a very cordial and friendly reception. The representative especially was a very intelligent and pleasant H man, and nad a most intelligent son, Halal, a lad of about 15 wiio took a groat interest in the guns ot the ship and askod sensible questions about aeroplanes. The Bheikh of kurbat is a collector of picture postcards cr photos of ships which called there and produced some for our i inspection, together &lt;vith various certificates including one from Vr. Bend. Beth 'Jor.manler Garatin and I were surprised at the number of French ships visiting kurbat, some quite recently. I was informed that there was a truce at present betweeni^age -i 2 S/UAXAH. g.ISHN , BALAHAF. the Amir of Ja'alan and Sultan of Muscat and that steps were being taJcen to bring about a permanent settlement of their diffei’encGS. We went on to bialalah ^iiich we i'eached at 3-30 p*m« The Sultan's representative, Saiyyed Saeed bin Ali was at Muscat, having accompanied F/L Hickards, and one, Said bin Seif, was acting for him. The Sultan's son, Said, aged 5 was also there, a precocious child who, in front of all/ the assembly, suddenly flew into a rage and administered a sound beating to one of the slaves. We were served vith coffee and sweetmeat and afterwards: took a walk round the town and its outskirts. As it was approaching the evening prayer, the representative declined Couman&amp;er G&amp;ratin's invitation to visit the ship and be shewn round. Both here and at Murbat, I thanked the authorities in the name of the resident and the Air Officer CcmiuanG.ing for the assistance they had gi'ver: to l'/L Rickards and the JUight I was left with the impression that tney would always be glad to see aeroplanes visiting them and would always wel come the visit of any ship or official, and 1 expressed a hope that perhaps, on any subsequent visit of an aeroplane, one or two of the chief local inhabitants might be given a flight. A separate report is given of our visit. We arrived at Balahaf at about 10 a.m. on 6th May, and 3/L Betts, the first Lieutenant and myself went ashore. We were received by Sultan Abdullah bin Mohsin, brother of the Bult:n, who was in sole charge, Sultan Ahmed bin Saleh, the uncle, who is usually at Balahaf, and ethers, having jx juso left for azzan to spend the 'Id there. I enquired afte vhe Sultan and was told that he was better but was being kept shut up at Azzan. Sultan Abdullah still complains about the behaviour of bin Thalab cf Bir Ali and accuses him of having recently instigated the tribesmen and xh supplied them with ammuni tion, to interfere with travellers on the road to Azzan. X advised him to take no counter measures, explaining that, if Bir Ali put hiii self in the wrong, that was no reason why he should do likewise. As he evinced a desire for a per manent settle; ient to be brought about between him and Bir Ail, ana the Abdali hultan to be the arbitrator, I told him to wait untxi a few days before the 3 months' truce expired, and then to write in to that effect, and on receipt of his letter we would v/rite to Bir All. He reports wholesale destruction of crops inland oy locusts. I asked him about the quarrelX between Ahl fyumush and Ahl Suleiman regarding the girl who was attducted and he ^ told me it was having his attention and he hoped to settle tiie quarrel shortly# He also held out promise of persuading the girl's husoand to divorce her and told me that he had already agreed to do so, but the man wanted Hs.100/- He said he would take guarantees frci both sides to enable the girl to return to her people in safety. I asked hir to report progress. Makaila and Ah*ar were not visited, the former, in view of the intended visit of H.M.S. 'EFFINGHAK* later on in the month, and the latter, owing to the distance of the capital from the coast. 3d/- M.C.Lake.

J.ASIRAH ISLAND Is about 40 miles long, running north-north-east from its southernmost point, RAS ABU RASAS, latitude 20° 9* SO' N., longitude 58° 38* 0“ S. It is of irregular oblong form and lies parallel to the coast, from which it is distant about 10 miles. Constricted in the middle to about 4 miles in breadth, the island widens out above and below this point to 10 miles and again tapers to oach extremity, 3. In the sound separating the island from the mainland are inary imlets, shallov; banks and rocky patches, leaving only very narrow navigable channels and the depths are stated to be less than those charted. The rise and fall of tide is 10 feet. 4. A chain of hills traverses l&amp;SIRAH longitudin ally from end to end, sending ridges down to all the principal capes, while shorter spurs protude in different directions over the island. The average height is given as 400', the highest point being 743*, but it is possible that these heights may prove to have been underestimated. Nearly all the hills are of volcanic formation , except some tableland near RAS YEI, the most eastern point of the island. Plat land is confined to the west side of the island, where it occurs as sandy plains that extend from the base of the hills to the sea and raised only a few fee feet above sea level. These plains are covered with small matted tufts of grass, resembling tufts of sea-pink. 5. The island is barren and sterile, producing no vegetation except a fev; small date groves and some pumpkins. 6. The population of the island is scanty; the figure is stated to be 1,000 in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot and 600 in the Gazetteer of Arabia; the latter figure seems the nearer estimate. The inhabitants belong chiefly to the JAlTilABAH tribe, are veyy poor and subsist chiefly on fish, which abound in the sea there. 7. The exports are tortoise-shell, shark-fine and dried fish; most of the trade seems to take v place v/ith UiSCAT.2 at' VISIT TO ItASIRAH ISL^ T D. S- 4 Wins to navigational difficulties t:ie / a^ip anchored off the north end of the island and, * in view of the reported unfriendly attitude of the inhabitants (Recent reports from Political Agent, iSDSCAT i Aed Sea &amp; Gulf of Aden Pilot, 7th Edition, 1921, pp 491 and 501: Gazetteer of Arabia, Vol II, pp 1181 &amp; 1182), a heavily armed party was sent in the ship * s metor boat. A landing was effected opposite IAVA7A (DAUA) village, the principal village of the island and stated to be the residence of the Sheikh of the island# iO. The party was received in a most friendly and hospitable manner. The Sheikh was not in residence on the island and was stated to live almost permanently on the mainland, only visiting the island occasionally. 12* During the discussion which followed our arrival and reception the villagers stated that they had heard of the visits of aeroplanes to DKUFAR and did not seem to be in any way hostile to the idea of a visit to MA5IRAH. Any difficulty in making a landing ground on the island will not be due to the attitude of the inhabitants. I 3, The inhabitants stated that the oheikh would be equally well disposed. Time did not permit of a visit to any of the other villages, in particular UUM RASAS, where. Judging from the chart, there would seem to be a suitable seaplane anchorage. Two of the villagers were brought back H.i-.I.S. 1 DA./RE' 1 , where they were shown over the ship and sent away ‘with presents of flour, rice and biscuits, for which they appeared very grateful, ■rater rifles and ammunition the most suitable form of present for such persons would seem to be food; sugar, coffee and tea are the most acceptable and* at the same time do not occupy much space. Every- wnere tno inhabitants appreciated cigarettes. SUITABILITY OF AS A LAUDING QROUttD 6c AKCHORnGL. 16. The plain near DA7.7A village is composed of hard sand and shells, with numerous tufts of dried grass; the ground rises gently from the sea to the hills and a landing could be effected on narrow patches of clear ground running inland at right angles to the coast; this, however, is at right angles to the prevailing winds. /k really suitable.../ 22 . • • • 17 • 13. FUTURE 19. 20 . 21 . - 3 - A really suitable landing ground near DAtftfA would require nuch preparation as the ground is cut up by narrow, shallow water channels. It is possible, however, that the plain nearer the middle of the island, v/here the hills are not so high# might prove more suitable, as the water channels might not be so pronounced there or might be entirely absent• Off yi!K RAS^iS village there is a long, narrow inlet, Sa miles long, with a width of 2 to 4 cables and depths of 1 to 3 fathoms; it is protected from I/ASIRAK CHAIU^L by an island Si miles long, running 1T.K.3 and S.S. T J. The inhab itants of DA\7,/A stated that this was a very good dhow anchorage during the south-west monsoon and was extensively used at that time, but was not so nuch used during the north-east monsoon as it is exposed to the winds which occasionally bio?/ very strongly from the north-east. In view of this the site would not appear to be suitable as a seaplane anchorage (other than an emergency one) as all the other anchorages on the coast are more suitable during the north-east monsoon. The Red 3ea a Qulf of Aden Rilot, 7th edition, 1921, states (p.436) that thick fogs are prevalent in the vicinity of the GULF OF HAS IRA during the north-east monsoon; these are carried dov/n with rapidity by a sudden northerly wind. POLICy AT Iv^IRAH how that friendly relations have been established with the island it should be visited by aircraft: the most suitable methods are:- (a) A visit by seaplanes from ADEN, the necessary fuel being carried in some ship such as K.11.I.3. si Lawrence ,! , which could act as a floating base. (b) A visit by flying boats from 'IRAQ; if fuel supplies were laid at EHOR JARAHAH the boats would h&amp;ve sufficient fuel to fly to IAS IRAK ISLAND and back to TGI OR JAR AMH • .. third alternative which might prove practicable would be to obtain a float under carriage for one of the xioths shortly to be allotted to this comnand and to carry a uoth on floats in one of K.il. ships. If one of H.H. ships is made available for such a visit the pro^anne should allow for some days to be spent in the vicinity of HASIRAE./ 26 . tr . Jr - 4 - 22. During the visit of aircraft the following could be carried out:- (a) Heconnaissanco by air of the island to ascertain the possibility of constructing a suitable terminal landing ground, followed by a ground reconnaissance of any suitable site so found. (b) Reconnaissance of the inlet at VI&amp;: RASAS to ascertain its suitability as a sea plane anchorage. (c) Touch to be established with the Sheikh on the mainland, when it might be found that the difficulties in the way of establishing a landing ground and seaplane anchorage on the mainland were not so great as anticipated. 23. Positions on the mainland, if practicable, would be preferable to positions on the island. 24. One explanation which has been given for the unfavourable reports of the attitude of the inhabitants of the mainland near UASIRAH and one which agrees both with the statements of the f//// .gullftn pf 1 a lALdJLfluring a visit to ADEN and with the friendly attitude of the inhabitants of ilASIRAH E8LAND is as follcws;- This territory owes allegiance to the Sultan of JA*ALAN, who nominally owes allegiance to the Multan of HJSCaT, but has quarrelled with him. The inhabitants are unfriendly towards the Sultan of W SCAT and pay no attention to letters of recommendation from him; therefore he feels himself unable to offer guarantees for visits to that territory• On the other hand, letters of recommen dation from the Sultan of JA*ALAN v/ould be favourably received. ^ It is understood that the quarrel betv/een the Sultans of HJSCAT and JA*ALAN has been patched //, up, so that it will probably be possible to obtain letters of rocormiendat ion from the Sultan of JA 1 ALAN through the Sultan of MUSCAT or the Political Agent, MUSCAT, might even agree to dealing direct with the Sultan of JA'ALAN; with such letters of recommendation the difficulties in the way of establishing landing grounds and/leaplane anchorare in this neighbourhood v/ould probably disappear.

I have, however, asked Air Force Headquarters at Aden whether the statement that the 'Lawrence' sent armed parties ashore at Masirah and other places on the Muscat Coast is correct, and I enclose a copy of Croup-Captain MacLea^s reply. In the circumstances now explained I think that paragraphs 8 and 9 of Squadron Leader Betts's report of the 'Lawrence 1 ' s visits to Masira.h etc. forwarded to Muscat under this Office letter No.C/327 dated 7th June 1930 may have given a misleading impression of what actually took place. I regret that I followed a wrong procedure in writing direct to the Political Agent, Muscat, regarding the establishment of landing grounds in the Muscat area. I assumed - wrongly as it appears - that he was in a position to deal with this matter in so far as it concerned him locally. All letters en this subject will in future be addressed to you. I note that you wish a copy of the ship’s letter of proceedings to be sent to you(as well as to the Senior Naval Officer) when R.I.M.ships visit the Persian Gulf area from Aden, and they will oe so informed if they do so again.

They can only have been seen by the two villagers who were taken off to H.H.I.S.'Lawrence' to receive presents of foodstuffs. , (-b) At MURBAT and SALALAH a guard of honour was taken ashore. It is pointed out that this guard consisted of native sailors and that the inhabitants of these places all brought their rifles on board H.H.I.S.

I would point out that no information was received from MUSCAT as to the mode of receiving and paying calls on local chiefs, which differs from thcit in vogue in this area dnd that all letters from MUSCAx stressed the danger of any parties landing in^the neighbourhood visited. In view of the latter I consider that the Captain of H.M.I.S.'Lawrence' would have been very imprudent had he neglected to take such arms as he considered sufficient to deal with any trouble which might arise. sd/- C.T.MacLean, Group Captain, Commanding, British Forces in Aden. • • • • •Telegram Code ( sent Tay R.A.F.W/T) From Political, Muscat, To Aviation, Hinaidi Mo.

It will not be necessary to make aky statement regarding the fuel dump at present, and matter of fact there is a possibility that the flying boat will not alight at all.

It is hoped to make arrangements with the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Oulf, for a sloop to be at MAMIRAH on the occasion of this first visit. 'Tie flying boats would then return and, as soon as the necessary arrangements have been completed, a further flight will be undertaken and the next stage of the route from MASH'AH ISLAND to MUR3AT will ba traversed. The ADEN 0 ommand have already established a landing ground and a fuel store at MtTRBAT, and reports indicate that little difficulty will be experienced in finally establishing the seaplane base, 'o^ all that remains to be done now is to lay moorings. The ADEN Command have already been requested to ‘Arrange the shipment of sufficient material for three moorings to iUHBAT, and this equipment is being delivered by Admiralty oil tanker, together with 2,000 gallons of petrol and 200 gallons of oil, which will fom ou' fuel establishment. 4. During the first visit to DHUFAR territory, the flying boats will lie at anchor and the question will be investigated as to whether the moorings should be laid at MURBAT or RAIMUT, or both. This investigation is necessary as it is considered that the monsoon periods may render each alighting area lOIKUb 1 # alternatively. Our decision in this respect will be communicated to you in due course. / 5. The Honoirable Political Resident, Persian Oulf, The Residency, UNSHIRE./%*■ hp Pi Telegram Code. From Political, Muscat.

The matter has since been fixed up by telegram and I hope you will have a successful trip.

Now as regards Uasirah Island. I may be wrong but I do not like the dhow idea very much. To begin with there may be practical difficulties in arranging for the simultaneous arrival of the dhow and the air-craft. Second, ly, it would be expensive to send the dhow there whenever we want to refuel. Je will, of course, have to do it that way the first occasion that we refuel there but it is an unsatisfactory method and I would like to arrange something more reliable as soon as practicable. Could we not in the course of our next visit take the matter a step further and simply declare our intention of putting a fuel store in the creek? If they refuse to look after it we can install a concrete underground tank which they would have some difficulty in interfering with. This could be done with the co-operation of a sloop and would not take very long. 10. I propose, if you have no objection, to send the Rangoons to Masirah Island again in July, primarily with a view to examining the creek during the monsoon to see whether it is sufficiently sheltered for use in those conditions. Apart from this the visit of the flying boats will accord with our desire to familiarise the natives with this form of transport. If the flying boats are able to alight it is proposed to take some soundings at the head of the creek where shoals are suspected.From Resident, Bushire. To Politicel, Muscat. ITo. 403.

To The Political Agent Muscat* Memorandum . A copy of letter Ho.S.10604, dated the 27th August 1931, from the Air Officer Commanding, ’Iraq Command, is forwarded herewith. With regard to the terms on which the ’Al Said* 2 should be hired the following items may be considered. la) Cost of coal required for the trip; (b) Wages bill during the period of the trip; (c) Cost of charter. Saiyid Said has asked only for payment of (a). The Hon’ble the Political Resident considers, however, that in view of the impoverished condition of the Muscat State (b) should also be paid for. As regards (c) he is of opinion that in view of Saiyid Said’s offer and of the fact that (a) and (b) will be paid for, no charge should be made for 1c). Please ask the Council if payment of (a) and lb) would be agreeable to them. If the State wish for 1c) in addition please ask them to quote a daily rate for this. 3.

Development of the Muscat -- Aden Air Route« S ir f I have the honour to refer to my letter S.10604 of 25th February 1931, on the subject of the development of the Muscat - Aden Air Route. ^ 2. As you are aware, it has not yet been possible to make any permanent arrangements for the provision of petrol stores at Masirah Island, and in order to enable flights to be made beyond that place it will be necessary to send petrol there upon each occasion on which flights are being made. 3. It is proposed to make a flight to Murbat and possibly further starting late in October or early in November next, and ^ ' I have recently been considering the question of the provision of petrol and oil for this flight. During the visit of the Fly ing Boats to Muscat at the beginning of this month, the Officer Commanding was informed by the Wazir that the Muscat Government would have no objection to the hiring of the *A1 Said* for the purpose of taking petrol to Masirah, Sayed Said added that he had received so many favours from the British Government that he would willingly let us have the ship for our purposes free of charge except for the quantity of coal burnt. The question of the terms upon which the ship should be hired appears to depend largely on political factors, and I should be glad of your advice as to the terms upon which the ship might be chartered. Should you consider that payment should'be made for the charter in addition to the cost of fuel consumed, it is suggested that a daily rate should be fixed. It would, of course, be necessary for the terms to be considered in my office before any definite undertaking is given to cliarter the ship. 4. I hope that a Political Officer will be able to accompany this cruise from Muscat onwards and if there is no objection, perhaps you would make a note of the approximate date of the cruise.

In company witk Group Captain Welsk I visited Masirak yesterday by Flying Boat returning tke same evening.

Tke Islanders gave us a very friendly reception, but as usual said tkey could come to no arrangement as tkeir Skaikk was absent. He always is ke may kave been really absent from the Island, or he ma,y kave been hiding behind the nearest sand-kill. So we had to come away without effecting tke desired arrange- rent.

The letter was read over to the Islanders, about 20 in number, who met us and was left with one of them for transmission to the Shaikk* Tke latter was vaguely reported to having gone to Sur and Oman, so His Higkness is giving a copy of his letter to tke Wall of Sur to make enquiries in that area. If the Shaikh is discovered in Sur or Jaalan, and has not time to return to Masirah before High Highness reaches there, he will be informed that he should stay in Sur until His Highness touches there on his way back to Muscat* I think that this is all we can do until we see the result of His Highness^ visit to Masirah: he should be hack here about 24th April* He will have two H.A*P.Officers with him vide attached letter from Group Captain welsh. ~ n giving a copy of this letter to Gro\ftp Captain we; Co^y forwarded to Group Captain G.w.tfelsh, R.A.P.Muscat.Telegram From ;n Clair ^ ^ ^ '• ^ Political Muscat To a.JM.O. repeatedC.Welsh T^cted 7th May 1232.

As you are aware H.M*S. rt Triad 11 was on the point of leaving Muscat for Masirah with a Royal Air Force Officer and myself on board, when she had on the 30th April to leave urgently for the Trucial Coast. 2. Barly in May after telegraphic correspondence be tween the Senior Naval Officer and myself, His Highness the Sultan at m^ request sent a letter to the Shaikh of Masirah overland from Sur ( communication by sea from Sur to Masirah had ceased owing to the Monsoon) informing him that he would be visited about 22nd May. 3. On the 22nd and 23rd instant two Flying Neats under the command of Group Captain Welsh arrived at Muscat, and on the 23rd H.M.S. rt Triad' with the Senior Naval Officer on board, en route for Masirah, the object being to establish there a refuelling base for Royal Air Force air-craft. All that was required for the moment was a rough stone building which could b# oon.truct.d by the islander* themselTesproTld«d th#y were supplied with beams and matting* These were put on board 'Triad'* 4* On previous visits to the island, where the Bani Bu Ali - who were still more or less recaleitrant - have influence, our policy was to keep the State in the back T / ground ( para 3 of my letter No*101 of 4-4-31)* On this occasion, however, owing to the recent success gained at Sur by the submission of Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah to the demands of the State, the time seemed to have come to work through the State* The Sultan himself was unable to come to Masirah, but at my request he sent a repre sentative, Saiyid Mahmud - one of his uncles, with a letter for Ahamis bin Hilal - the Shaikh of the island, explaining what was wanted. 5* 'Triad' left Muscat on 24th instant with Saiyid Mahmud on board, and I left by air with^roup Captain Welsh on the morning of the 25th* Stopping at Khor Jeramah on the way we reached Unn Rasas that afternoon some time ahead of 'Triad'* Three of the islanders came off to meet the Plying Boat - the first occasion on which the first move has come from the island* They had a letter from the elusive Khaais whoa we had been press ing for more than a year, to the effect that he had re ceived the Sultan t s letter, but had had to go to Sur. 6 On arrival of 'Triad' an hour or so later, the Senior Maval Officer , e Secretary^Lieut-Commander Tottenham and the ship 1 ! Interpreter landed direct to explain matters to the islanders, and then picked up^roup Cap tain Welsh, Flight Lieutenant Chiek and myself from the Flying Boat, and took us on board 'Triad' for the night at the kind invitation of the Senior Baval Officer* Lieut Commander Tottenham reported that the islanders, of whom there^were only a small number present - the rest havingMigrated to the mainland for the Monsoon, were apparent ly prepared to accept what was required of them* 7 • It was therefore decided, notwithstanding the absence of the Shaikh, to land the building materials the next morning. This was accordingly done, and Saiyid MahELud, *^roup fcptain Welsh and isyself went ashore for an interTiew with the inhabitants of ilmm Hesas of whom there appeared to be barely a dozen left. They willingly took charge of the materials, and were told that after the monsoon a klying Boat or a sloop would pay the* a risit and instruct them as to the building of the petrol store* Saiyid Mahmud 'jajE+rt them a small present in cash, and I gaye them some rice,flour and sugar* 8 # The Flying Boat with group Captain Welsh, then left for Muscat, carrying t letter from 3aiyid Mahmud to be dropped over 8 ur, instructing the Wall to bring Shaikh Khamis on board 'Triad** when she arrived there on the following day. 9. That there was suchia person as the shaikh, whose existence 1 had almost begun to doubt, was proved by the fact that, dn company with the Wall, he came on board at Cur, was duly interviewed by Saiyid Mahmud and myself and the situation explained to him* Me is a pleasant enougn individual of about 35, and professed himself com pletely obedient to the Sultan*s orders. In usual Arab fashion he tried to disclaim responsibility to the effeet M If that he was only primus inter pares amongst the other headmen of the island. I daresay there is some trutM in this vide para 4 of my letter Bo.101 quoted above, and the other headmen will doubtless try and •butt in*.

On arrival at Umm Rasa is,a small collection of huts and three or four stone buildings where most of the fish caught in those parts is dumped for drying and export,it was found that Sheikh Khamis bin Hilal,Sheikh of Masirah,was away at the fishing grounds. Chartering a dhow which happened to be lying at anchor there we despatched it in search of the Sheikh and,in the meantime,occupied ourselves in examining any build ing likely to prove suitable as a petrol store. 3. With the assistance of Captain Mackay R.'S. a suit able building belonging to one Salim bin Saeed was eventually found,the owner being willing to rent it subject to the approv al of the Sheikh. 4 . In the meantime the boatman who had been despatch ed in search of Sheikh Khamis,returned saying that there was no trace of the Sheikh and that he was thought to have gone to main land. As there was no object in staying any longer at Umm Rasais we decided to return to Muscat,visiting Sur enroute on the chance of finding Sheikh Khamis there. Owing to the f roughness of the sea,however, we were compelled to return direct to Muscat which we reached on Wednesday the l 6 th. 5 . On Wednesday 23rd we again left Muscat hoping to be able to land at Sur and locate Sheikh Khamis. On arrival at Sur it was ascertained that Sheikh Khamis had left Sur a few days before and v/ould # without much doubtbe now on the island of Masireh. 6 . Next day.accompanied by Sheikh Nasir bin Ali,the most important Sheikh in Sur and of the same tribe i.e. Genibah,2 . ss th« people of Mesirah,we proceeded to Umm Rassis,whence we despatched a man to fetch Sheikh Khamis from a village at the other end of the island. 7. Next morning,Sheikh Khamis having in the meantime arrived,we broached the subject in view. Sheikh Khamis,being a typical Bedu^in|,there ensued a great deal of beating about the bush,the Sheikh being evidently torn between the desire to provide a building and take the rent himself and the fear of assuming a responsibility which might give his enemies a chance of bringing him into bad repute,by,for example,setting fire to the dump. 8 . In the meantime the owner of the selected building thinking himself to be the only pebble on the beach,was engaged in raising the rent,the sum demanded having already i^aeched the figure of Rs.j&gt;0 per mensem. Sending him about his business, therefore,with the intimation that we had no further use for his house we settled down to see if some arrangement could not be made whereby the Sheikh would agree to build a store himself at any spot selected by the R.A.F and l$t it to them for a reasonable sum. This the Sheikh was willing to do for a rental of Rs.30 per mensem but he also insisted upon having four guards to look after it at a salary of £.15 per mensem each which would have brought the total of rent and salaries up to nearly Rs. 80 per mensem. 9. At this point it was found that Salim bin Saeed, the owner of the house,was bewailing his fate outside. He was accordingly called in,offered Rs.25 pwr mensem for his house and two months advance cash down. Sheikh Nasir bin Ali,in the meantime, wrote out a form of agreement which Salim signed without any more ado. Flight Lieutenant Ragg signed on behalf of the R.A.F and the document^witnessed by Sheikh Khamis, Sheikh of Masirah,and myself. Sheikh Khamis further agreed to engage a boatman -care taker- who would be given a hori by the R.A.F,at a salary of £.10 per mensem. Salim bin Saeed also agreed to look after his house and the petrol himself. This arrangement,although,the house rented is at 10 .some distance from the sea,is probably the best,as the whole village and their relations in other villages around,will be ce se interested in the safety of the store,which would not be the/ had the Sheikh himself taken on the contract. The price also, of Rs.^3 per mensem inclusive of Watch and Ward,is very moderate compared to the other proposition. The boatman -care taker- will be provided by the Sheikh and his hori will be supplied by the R.A.F,he will visit flying boats immediately on arrival,take their orders and arrange as far as possible for labour for loading petrol. 11 . Rs.200 was paid to Sheikh Khamis as a personal present from the Hon’ble the Political Resident and another Rs.40 was paid at the rate of Rs.10 each to four minor Sheikhs or influential men in the village. £.30 was given to Sheikh Nasir bin Ali of Sur in consideration of the trouble incurred by him,expenses of food,etc. In addition to this some head dresses,coffee and sugar were distributed. An order for the monthly payment of rent of the godown i.e. Rs.23, and of £.10 for the boatman -care taker- was given to Messrs Khimjee Ramdass of Sur. ‘12. I have to thank Flight Lieutenant Ragg for his hospitality and kindness under somewhht exacting conditions. Yours sincerely /2^. Captain.

Sir, • *: With r^fere^ce to your letter No.C/165 of 1933, I agree that no mention was made in the agreement signed by Sheikh Khaijiis bin Kilal al Maja ! ali on the 24th November, 1932 for porterage of petrol between the houri and the petrol dump at Masira, but this, it was understood, i.as included in the 10 Dollars per month to be paid to the men for looking after the houri. Normally, on refuelling, the number of tins to be carried will not be great, and it was considered that these men who draw their 10 Dollars per month for a considerable period without being used would give their services on X&amp;e few occasions they are required. If, however, you think this is insufficient, I suggest an agreement be drawn up whereby porterage is paid at the rate of one anna for two tins. This is the normal sum paid in the Persian Gulf. 2 . as regards the porterage referred to in the Sheikh 1 s letter attached to yours quoted above, it was understood that this would be included in the sum charged by the Agent at Muscat, Khimji iiamdas, for transferring the petrol from Muscat to Masira. 3. As it is proposed to send flying boats to Masira and beyond early in November, I hope this matter can be settled before then.

My Council have undoubtedly done the needful as requested and 1 will make this incident known to some sensible men of this place as most ol the inhabitants of this part of uy country are nomads and are Ij-ving in the mountains and are therefore not acquainted with these affairs. X thank you for your good wishes to myself and my Government. Reference your letters NobK/77 and C/196 dated 14th September and 13th October respectively on the subject of connecting Aden and Basrah by an air^for tne use of the Royal Air Force land planes. You have pointed out that a refuelling station and emergency landing grounds are required along the way lor this purpose and that you have been directed by the Rouble the Political Resident to ask my permission to carry out the reconnaissance in the area between Masirah Island and Murbat. The action of the air party will be confined to selecting and marking out a refuelling station and a landing ground about half way between Masirah and Murbat and marking out landing grounds between this refuelling station and ^uasirah on one hand and between it and Murbat on the other hand. You have also sent &amp; sketch plan asking my permission for a landing ground at tocxixxk Skagha island as the present landing ground ■HKwmm 2 . ground at Masirah is not satisfactory on account of and roughness of its surface. Vith great pleasure I accord the permission sought for in your ahovementioned letters# but as you have pointed out in para 6 of your letter Ko.K/77 of 14th September about the wild nature of the coast between Hasirah and Murbat# it is necessary that a suitable arrangements should be made for the protection of the party whenever they intend to go there. As this question requires a lengthy explanation and I am unable to express it fully in writing it is advisable therefore that you should accompany the said party. I will# God willing, afford them all assistance in carrying out the desired object. You have also pointed out that the months of October and November are the most favourable months for the proposed aerial reconnaissance, that the Senior Naval Officer will co-operate by sending a sloop in support of the air party and that it is difficult for him to send a sloop to such a long distance after the month of November. All I can say in this connection is that if you decide to carry out the reconnaissance in the month of Novemoer you should inform the Council of Regency at Muscat who will arrange for one or two men from Sur to accompany you in the sloop. I have informed my Council about this matter, if it is pussitle and you approve of it you may come to the town of Dhofar# where 1 am living and a fort exists, and which I think is about 35 miles distant from Murbat. I will meet you there and explain the whole situation. I have already pointed ouu that a suitable arrangement is necessary to be made for the purpose of carrying out the reconnaissance owing to the wild nature of the coast. 1 will send one of my uncles and a few men with you. 1 do not see it advisable that the air party and yourself should take any action before making the necessary arrangements and I uui am quite sure that you will agree with me in this matter. i With3 •&lt; ’^Ith referencs to your letter Ko.C/169 dated 22nd July 1933 to ray Council with regard to an emergency landing ground (and presumably a petrol dump) at Shinas about which you have received a telegram from the Hon’ble the Political iiesident* You have not mentioned in your letter whether it is required for Crovernment or some other Companys aeroplanes. I will send you an answer as soon ao I hear about this point from you* You have also pointed out at the end of your abovernentioned letter that you would send further particulars as soon as they are received from the Political Kesident. On the 21st Jamadi II, 1352 (12/10/33) I sent you a letter enclosing one to the address of the Hon’ble the Political Resident. I hope you have received them. I have informed you in that letter that I intend to return to kuscat at the beginning of February 1934 and explained the reasons for which I aia unable to leave Bhofar before that date. In para 6 of your letter tfo.K / 65 dated 9th September you have expressed the hope that my return to Muscat will not be delayed any longer as my early return will permit the discussion of various matters which require personal attention. I shall be very glad to meet you with the air party at Dhofar so that we may discuss tne matters in question 1 am sorry for not answering your letter earlier as I did not receive them before. I have received a letter from my Council to the effect that you have communicated certain aerial matters to them and that they have answered that they were not authorised to deal in these matters. You are a»vare that I have not empowered my Council in such matters. In these days no boats are avau.aoie to proceed from here to Muscat as they have left a few days ago for Muscat and other places. On the 3rd November I saw two flying boats were proceed^ ing to Aden. As the Oificers of the aeroplanes which arrived here last month informed us that two flying boats will arriveat tfurbat on their way to Aden and will return again to ^Turhat on the 9th Kovember, on their return journey to Muscat, I saw that the only way of sending an early answer to your letters is to despatch my letter today to iiurbat and ask the Officers of the flying boats to carry them to you* I hope that they will oo so and tbe letter will j.g ac ,*i you in time. I shall be very grateful if you will send an answer tc my previous letter. X enclose herewith a letter to the address of the Hon’ble the Political Resident and shall be grateful if you will forward it to bim.Political Agency &amp; H.S.M’s Consulate Muscat, 7th December 1933. vo.&amp;tlJi- u£ 1933 Prom The Political Agent &amp; H.B.M , s Consul Muscat To Sir Subject:- Refuelling Dump at Masirah Island The Group Captain, Commanding 203 (F.B.) Squadron Royal Air Force, *ith reference to your letter No.203-2/555/(^/70 Basrah dated 10th September 1933, I have the honour to place the following facts before you, but before doing so, I w 0 uld tender you my oincere apology for the long delay which has inadvertently occured in replying to your above quoted number. It was hitherto not understood how sheikh Khamis 2 had arrived at his computation of 1320 tins of petrol and 50 drums of oil transported at Masirah Island. Enquiry now shows that 1250 tins of S.A.P.petrol 3 and 50 drums of oil constituted the original consignment sent to Masirah on 22nd November 1932. These figures added to those of F/Lieut. Ragg i.e. 70 tins petrol drawn on 17th February 1933 (vide his letter dated 19th February 1933 to aiy address) tally with the figures quoted by Sheikh Khamis 4. Although I am not in possession of the agreement drawn up by you with the Muscat Agent for shipment of the petrol and oil to Masirah, neither universal custom nor usage would/indicate that transport (i.e.freight) charges include porterage at destination. In the present case this is the more apparent from the fact that the shipping con tractor K.B.Mohamad Nasib (Mohamad Khan) has no connectionwith Khimji Ramdas, w ho is solely agent for Sheikh Khamis. 5. Under the circumstances therefore it w 0 uld certainly seem that Sheikh KhaIais , claim to porterage is fully just* ified,although the rate claimed hy him is incorrect, and should be at the rate of one anna for t w o tins, whether oil or petrol. 6 . The correct total of Sheikh Khamis*claim therefore amounts to Rs 42-13-0 ius£xx±k&amp; and I w 0 uld be grateful for the early receipt of your authority to pay this amount. 7. As regards future refuelling arrangements at Masirah Island I am addressing you separately.

Hate;- 30th December, 1933. Subject;- HHFUELLING AHHANGHMulNTb - MAolxiA INLAND. ► On the 16th December, 1933, I landed at Masira Island to inspect the refuelling arrangements there, and have to report as follows:- I landed at 1114 hours Gr.M.f. in a South- East wind of approximately 28 knots, and a rough sea, and was forced to anchor a mile off-shore from UMM KABAo, where the present petrol store is positioned, owing to various shoals and banks not indicated on the present chart. 2. After waiting half-an-hour, no native craft appeared, and Flying Officer Coates was sent ashore in the rubber dinghy to investigate. 3 . He found the native boat, the property of the Royal Air Force, in a dilapidated condition and unfit for further service, as it had apparently been left in the open on the beach unattended for some considerable time. The petrol store was found to be in a satisfactory condition, but it was only after a period of approximately one hour that sufficient local labour could be found to transport the petrol tins to the foreshore. Additional delay was incurred in acquiring a boat to take the petrol out to the flying boat, and eventually a small native ’houri' was requisitioned for this purpose. This craft could only carry a limited amount of petrol, and it was necessary for it to make three trips for the shore to the flying boat, a somewhat perilous proceeding owing to the state of tne water and the strong tide running at the time. Refuelling to the extent of 200 gallons was completed in approximately four and a half hours, the last trip by the ’houri’ being carried out in darkness 4. The question of the native boat, the property of the R.A.F., and the scarcity of available labour, is being taken up with shaikh khamis by the Political Agent, Muscat, and a further communication on these matters will be addressed to you in due course. 5. If the intention is to use oHAOHA INLAND as a landing ground in the future, the delay in the provision of fuel for aircraft is likely to be very con siderable as no means of communication with UMM RA^Ao exists, other than by attracting the atiention of stray /nativenative boats which may by chance be in the vicinity. 6 . In the event of a decision to use as a landing ground, it would, I feel, be a more convenient arrangement, for land aircraft and flying boats to have a new petrol store built on ihAGiLii loLAlii) in such a position as to be convenient for the use of both types of aircraft. This would in the long run prove an economy owing to the amount of rent paid for the use of the present petrol store. 7. There is a considerable extent of tidal foreshore around SHAGHA IdLAhb which is not accurately detailed by available charts, and I am therefore not prepared to state, without further investigation, the best site for the suggested new petrol store. 8 . The political Agent states that in the event of a decision to build a petrol store on dfcLAGrHA loLAlfb, the permission of the Sultan of Muscat will have to be obtained, but that there is likely to be no difficulty in acquiring sanction. 9.

No agreement had been entered into as regards porterage prior to the despatch of the consignment and it was only by threats y cajolery and a liberal distribution of largesse that hhamis persuaded the islanders to accept the situation and to land the petrol. he says 'the ice now broken (or the **rab equivalent i) the people are no longer afraid and you can pay anything as bakhshish to them and they will accept it'. 6. There was considerable truth in his contention and 1 finally entrusted the matter to His highness the Sultan's delegate for arbitration.

I do not anticipate that His Highness will raise any objection to the proposal but I think it probable in view of local circumstances that some small remuneration will be demanded as a return for the enforcement of responsibility on Bheikh Khamis for non-interference with the store and for 'good will'. 5.

The present store at Umm Rasas seems quite satisfactory although, as you have pointed out in previous correspondence, there is usually some difficulty in obtaining labour or getting the houri out to the flying boats. In our letter S. 11030/26 of the 13th March it was explained that we did not require a store at Shagha Island and from our letter S.11030/26 of the 19th May you will see that we are proposing to renew the original agreement for facilities at Masirah.

Authority has been given for the construction of a new store at a site as marked on the attached x&gt;lan. 3. This site would be more convenient for the refuelling of flying boats and land aircraft. 4. In order to avoid any ill feeling it is proposed to pay a ground rental of Rs. 300 p er annum for the proposed new site. This is similar to what is now paid for the present store and will, there fore, not involve any financial loss to the Sheikh. 5. I would be grateful if you would obtain the necessary permission and arrange the contract in due course. 6. I would be glad if you will inform me at an early date if there are any difficulties to the above proposal. ( 1 ^ Group Captain, Commanding, No. 203 (P.

His Highness whilst fully appreciate your proposal ta pay Rs.300 par annum for the proposed site agrees with me that this amount appears at first sight excessive. Ha considers that it would be sufficient to pay a small monthly sum to a nominal chewkidar or guardian, in principal 1 agree and details could be subsequently worked out but at the moment it would seem as if a sum af 80 ta 90 rupees a year will suffice. 4. if and when the work is put in hand and accomplished tayaur satisfaction it might be ta yaur interests to pay a small douceur amounting ta 50 or 60 rupees and seme coffee ta Sheikh rJnamis bin Hilal or ethers wha have helped in the protection af the construction either practically •r by goad will. Such proposal would i think be2 efficacious whilst being economical to the Royal Air Force. As you are well aware considerable difficulties occurred in the past in the matter of transporting stores from the shore to the ship. 1 will suggest for your consideration that in the design of the new petrol store accommodation may be found for a good sized heeri (canoe) which would thus be available and under lock and key for the conveyance of petrol to Flying boats. The adequate preservation of this Hoori could be ensured by leaving it always half full of uea water. 6 . As it is to be anticipated that His highness will be leaving Muscat for Dhefar immediately after the monsoon 1 would be grateful if you will let me Know as early as possible (a) when it is proposed to commence the work (b) hew long it will take (c) whether you propose to import labour from Muscat or farther afield. 1 have the honour to be* Sir Your most obedient servant.
