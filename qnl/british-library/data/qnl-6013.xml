Dear Sir, I have felt for some time that the excellent contour plan in your office will be of great value to me during this survey and as I feel that I cannot wait till Sunday I will be extremely glad if you will allow Lt. Plank with three of his surveyors to take a tracing of that part of the map which interests us. It will be possible for the men to trace the map on the wall but if it could be removed, which I believe is quite possible, it will be most helpful. I am extremely sorry to spring this surprise on you but I feel that the use of a copy of the map is too great a benifit to be lost. Yours sincerely, Captain, I.E.C\ SECRET.
