Cf. 394 of 1914. British Besidenoy and Consulet^-Gfeneral, Bxishire, 30th October 1914. From 1 To Lieutenant Colonel 8. &amp;. Knox, C.I.E., Offg: Political Resident in the Persian Culf, The Porciif^n Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Delhi. Sir, In continuation of my letter Ho. 239 of 15th September 1914 on the subject of local politics in Kerman, I have the honour to forrmrd, for the information of the Government of India, a resume of further telegraphic correspondence on this CD O subject. The strong faction in Kerman opposed to Sirdar Muhtaaham, continued to do its best to undermine the Governor General’s es position at Tehran by a seri^f^ of ill-founded complaints. His Majesty’s Minister on more than one occasion telegraphed to Sirdar Muhtasham in a reassuring strain, promising him his support in spite of the fact that he had been prejudiced in the eyes of the Prime Minister by the continuous complaints * brought“brought against him. It has been suggested that Lecoffre, the Financial Agent in Kerman, who is strongly biassed against all B&amp;khtiaris, may be at the bottom of these intrigues. In the uiddie oT October, the change in Southern Go Tremor ships, which has been pending for some time, was finally decided on. Sirdar Huhtasham is to proceed to « Ispahan and his place at Kerman will be taken by Sirdar 2affar, who owes his appointment to special instructions issued by His Majesty’s Government thet the Bakhti&amp;ri Khans are not to be alienated. His Majesty’s Minister considers that the new incumbent will require to be kept well in hand, i although he has given satisfactory assurances. Captain Lorimer has oointed out danger that may arise from an interregnum, and has suggested that Sirdar Zaffar’s departure should be expedited, or better a Deputy Governor be appointed, pending his arrival. To date there is no further news, either as regards the departure of Sirdar Muhtasham from Kerman, or that of Sirdar Zaffar from Tehran, I have, etc., Sd/- S. G. Knox, Ideut-Colonel, Offgs Political Besicient in the Persian GulfNo. dated Bushire, the 15th September 1914. From— Major S. G. Knox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India a resume of recent telegraphic correspondence on the subject of local politics at Kirman. In the beginning of September the Governor-General, Sirdar Muhtasham broached the subject of his taking a hundred gendarmes and a maxim gun to carry out a disciplinary tour in his district. His Majesty^ Consul, while approv ing in principle of the tour, viewed with misgivings the proposal to employ gendarmes as likely to delay the carrying out of the work for which they came to Kirman, namely the protection of the Bandar Abbas-Kirman, trade route. His Majesty’s Minister was not opposed to the employment of gendarmes, provided the tour proposed was likely to react favourably on the condition of the road, but thought that apart from this, it was undesirable that the Governor-General should proceed on tour until the question of the redistribution of the Southern Governorships was decided. It appears that His Majesty’s Minister has Sirdar Muhtasham in mind as Governor-General at Ispahan, but fears that open support would in all probability call forth Russian opposition as in the case of Samsam-es-Sultaneh and Sirdar Bahadur, and that the only way to support his candidature is to get the Rus sians to put him forward as their own nominee. It is interesting to note that the Swedes at Kirman do not intend placing their men on the road until they are guaranteed payment of the expenses of the maintenance of the force for a considerable period. They point out, and it must be acknowledged with some force, that if their men were not paid it would be difficult to prevent them looting and robbing, if scattered over some 300 miles of country.

Governor-General has submitted to me through Honorary Vice-Consul that ' he only consented to come here on a definite promise that he would be enabled to make an expedition against Baluchis. He is in debt and cannot support himself or his greedy and dissatisfied adherents here owing to strict watch kept enactions of himself and his subordinates. Similarly he cannot meet pecuniary demands of his colleague in Tehran. He is prepared to revise and reduce his estimates of expenses for Baluchi expedition. Presumably he will make good the sacrifice by plundering. If in one way or another it is not made possible he will resign and depart as soon as weather is cool enough to make travelling pleasant. I think this is not impossible as I have always believed main consideration which would and did induce him to come to Kerman was hope of Baluchi Ex pedition. He has personally behaved very well since he came here but it is doubtful if it will be possible for him to maintain his present standard of conduct as his income must be insufficient to satisfy his followers’ demands. It might satisfy him if allowed a free hand in Baluchistan re-embursing himself and his countrymen as he went along. This would not entail much more injustice to population than if Governor-General was also drawing funds from the Persian Government and Baluchis do not deserve any great tenderness. In any case I should of course try and reconcile Governor-General to what ever (?) may eventually prevail. r India, F Gecrei arvs Enclosure No. 2.

Governor-General of course knows that he is talking nonsense when he says that he only consented to go to Kerman on condition that he should be allowed to undertake an expedition into Baluchistan. He knows perfectly well that he ■ made his appointment to Kerman a condition of his withdrawal of his opposition to Samsam’s appointment to Ispahan. He is probably now agitating the Baluchi flag because he is seeking an excuse to get away from Kerman, in hopes that he may succeed Samsam whose tenure of office is insecure. Reference cannot be found, but I think that you once reported that Lecoffre had stated in Amir Mufakham’s time that he could finance a Baluchi expedition. I did nothing on scheme outlined in your telegram No. 35 of May 9th, because I gathered that impossibility of sending gendarmes (might ?) wreck plan. I should be very glad to meet wishes of Governor-General, and will support him if you think expedition feasible and consent of Persian Government can he obtained. I told Governor-General when in Tehran that I saw no use in a mere maraud ing expedition that had no chance of leaving anything stable behind it. Governor- General should address himself to Persian Government for necessary permission and assistance. - C 85 FD— 44 — 11 * 7 - 14 —GCBP Simla( 784 &gt; Telegram, it. rroi - The Political ^eaidnnt in the iarelan r ulf, 0C1 j'xy to the ( ever, . of Xallfli la 1 M foreign and Political pepartr^ant, hlmla. ho.781.

On his return from Bandar Abbas Major Gilmsted has strongly urged me to press for re-adjustment of Fars-Kerman boundary so as to include district of Ahnadi In Kerman province. All Khan of that place is very powerful and at the beet it is certain that necessity for negotiations and agreementa will arise. Governor General of Pars and Kawam have addressed telegrams through Glimsted to All Khan exhorting him to serve gendarmerie and promising that 75 of his men will terax* be employed by them on road. Situation will be come involved and it will be difficult for Kerman gendarmerie to carry on the negotiations or make arrangements through the authorities at Shiraz who VI rv 7/tmoreover will not ordinarily be able to help them.

Reference your telegram No. 56.* Gendarmes subsequently received arrears due for ordinary expenditure. Their budget is divided into ordinary and extraordinary expenditure. Former includes salaries and normal expenditure, and amounts to 14,300 Tomans per month. Latter includes cost of houses, saddlery, uniform, bedding and motor car. Cost of building barracks and posts. While travelling expenses, telephones on Bandar Abbas road unforeseen form half of total which is 127,100 Tomans per annum and is variously apportioned to various months. Up-to-date 37,100 Tomans, this is due on budget but it will be impossible in these circumstances to go purchasing horses and enlisting new recruits and hundreds of workmen will have to be dismissed. \ No provision has been made for food for horses, which is costing 3,000 Tomans per month for 350 horses ; in the meantime this is being paid from surplus on budget for ordinary expenditure. A week ago gendarmes had only 2,000 Tomans in hand to disburse 3,500 pay of gendarmes on June 22nd. Some of their sanctioned expenditure appears to me excessive for example allowance of nearly 28 lbs. of grain per cart-horse per day. No horse could consume this and live.

He proposed to sell to Government through Lecoffre 25,000 rounds which he had of his own and purchasing for Govern ment 75,000 rounds from abroad. He asked me to enquire whether required kinds of ammunition are available in Maskat and enquiries are being conducted through Bushire. I would beg to ask whether Persian Government has actually granted such permission and whether it will be able to produce necessary cash. Some of ammunition, roughly Rs. 1,000, is known to be available in Maskat but I can undertake no negotiations until assured of Government’s sanction and actual cash are in my hands.

Governor-General and Fathab-us-Sultaneh have again approached me regarding latter’s appointment to Governorship of Yazd. I communicated Your Excellency’s answer but they say Governorship will in fact be conferred on Sardar Zafar but that, as you say, he will not go there himself and that he wants to put in Muntazim-ud-Dauleh to act. Governor-General (group omitted ? casts) aspersions on Sardar Zafar’s loyalty to British and says he himself earnestly desires to have a partisan of his own in charge at Yazd. On the other hand he will make Muntazim-ud-Dauleh Deputy Governor at Kerman. This would in my opinion be excellent from Kerman point of view and if Fathab-us-Sultaneh had independent responsibility he might be more circumspect, in any case it would be easier to make out a case against him and remove him . without to some extent involving Sardar Muhtasham. I should like to see Fathab removed from charge where it is difficult to know exactly what he is responsible for but I am not yet prepared formally to ask for his dismissal. Enclosure No. 2.

He has now shown me a scorching telegram from Minister of the Interior reprimand ing him and ordering the immediate recall of Saham-us-Sultaneh. Governor- General has replied unless the above mentioned district is placed in his hands he cannot be responsible for the security of Kerman-Yazd road as he will be unable to hold robbers of Shahr-i-Babak and Pars tribes in check.Vt 1 ^ p 9 : I i' India, roi Wo 27 -U d t CONFIDENTIAL.

Much money was being expended on building large gymnasia and dining halls.

This is only more or less what one expects of detachments of Bakhtiaris in provinces. It will probably be easy to get objectionable Pishkar removed. Sardar Muhtasham is visiting me to-day and I will speak to him. As regards representative at Bam it is to be remembered that there are no British subjects there and British trade is probably not much (group undecy- pherable—? affected) by disturbances in town. On the other hand if a British Officer were appointed Vice-Consul there Imperial Bank of Persia would probably open branch and Hindu merchants depute agent so that from point of view of British as apart from Persian interests appointment would probably justify itself in course of time. At present all I expect from Consulate Agent is news and trade and caravan statistics and that is all I should care to trust to any native for. I have no objection to appointment of telegraph signaller as a temporary step but as a permanency it would have all the disadvantages of a half measure. I require Fowle very much here and doubt efficacy of occasional visits, as much could be effected 1 think by putting pressure on Governor-General here. I have just done so successfully in regard to another matter in Bam. Imperial Bank of Persia has spoken repeatedly of investigating business prospects in Bam and I would suggest that they be encouraged to do so. If prospects prove good it might then be considered whether appointment of a British Officer as Vice-Consul was necessary or desirable. Hindus might also be (^roup undecypherable—? told) that there is considerable likelihood that Bakhtiaris will beha\e similarly in other districts and it will not be possible to keep sending out Consular Officers on their tracks everywhere.

Personally I am in favour of transfer as far as circumstances are known to me, vide my despatch No. 28, November 24th, 1913* Lecoffre is also very keen on it. Your despatch 7, November 28th, i 9 I 3 - ^ still also think Ears boundary further south should be re-adjusted. Fact that Gendarmerie are not restricted by provincial boundaries does not affect question as far as provincial Governors are concerned and their assistance in some form will probably have to be invoked sooner or later in regard to robber communities of the Madi Rahdar tract. Qavvam will not always be campaigning in Eastern Fars and in any case no direct benefit has as yet accrued to Kerman from his operations. No. 86, dated nth May 1914.

Cost of material can be doubt e s forked out roughly but it seems impossible to frame any probable estimate o ost of operations or of how far it could be met from revenue and resources of Baluchistan itself. If anything is to be done this year sanction for purchase of munitions of tar and material must be granted at once as even now it would be difficult to irocure them in time to enable expedition to start as it should do in early autumn, rrangernems for seeking out and collecting the large quantity of transpor men- ioned to which has to b? added Gendarme requirements will also demand time.

I question usefulness of mountain guns to Gendarmerie and their ability to use tbem. To best of my knowledge they are practically useless against mud forts or walls which can only be dealt with by means of heavy guns or gun ootton. As far as I know none of Indian Horth West Frontier Xevy’s are provided with guns. Glimsted seems to think mountain guns can be used for high angle fire like mortars which I think is erroneous I would judge that their effective use at all, requires trained officers men and mules as in India.

I will do all I can but Sardar Muh- tasham is not within reach of telegraph and will not be in for some days. Also as far as I know he has no funds, so matter will have probably to be referred to Tehran. Extract from Bandar Abbas diary No. 16 for 'week ending 22nd April 1914 (received 30th April 1914)' 75. Captain Biscoe has received a telegram from His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, to the effect that the Sardar Muhtasham js not due at Kerman for some days, but that on his arrival Captain Lorimer will inform him of the delay to the escort of Misbah-i-Divan, but that it seems doubtful even then if funds will be forthcoming, and a reference to Tehran will probably be necessary. The Nasir-ul*Mamalik Rais of the Bakhtiari sowars who have come here to escort Misbah-i-Divan called on Captain Biscoe a few days ago, and seemed extremely unwilling to proceed to Chahbar, even if funds were provided. He said that the idea of sending the Misbah-i'Divan to establish order in Baluchistan with 40 men was absurd (which it undoubtedly is); that it was beginning to get hot, and the Bakhtiaris were unaccustomed to a hot climate, and that it would be impossible to attempt to move from Chahbar before the autumn, and therefore he saw no use in going there. All this is perfectly true, and it is ridiculous to suppose that the Baluchis who have openly resisted the Persian Government for the last 7 years are now going to submit at the magic of the name of a man who started life as a small shop-keeper in Ahwaz. When the mission was first proposed Captain Biscoe was f under the impression that it was intended to send Misbah to Baluchistan via Kerman ; he could then have advanced to Rigan or some such place, and have opened negotiations with the Baluch Chiefs from there ' it is impossible that anything would have resulted, but at any rate it would have cost but little. His despatch to Chahbar however is a very different matter, and it is difficult to | believe that it is seriously expected to have any result. It seems much more pro bable that the Misbah was endeavouring to get back at any rate to the neigh bourhood of Bandar Abbas, in the hope that a fortunate turn of events and the influence of his friends might reinstate him as Deputy Governor, more especially I as his mission to Baluchistan would afford him a pretext of collecting an armed force. His attempt to land at Bandar Abbas has so far been frustrated but if his escort fails him it seems unlikely that he will spend the summer in solitary state in a tent at Chhabar. Telegram P. No. 79, dated 1st (received 2nd) May 1914. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas. (Repeated Political Resident, Bushire, No. 80.) Please refer to your telegram No. 47. I will try to guard against the infringement of the orders, of which 1 am aware, prohibiting Misbah-i-Divan from landing at Bandar Abbas. Misbah and Sardar Muhtasham are carrying on correspondence by telegraph which I see. Misbah says that unless money and men are given him his position is untenable; he should be summoned (presumably to Kerman) if delay is e x * On April 28th the final reply was sent by Sardar Muhtasham tellirg Misbah to go and stay with Sardar Saiyid Khan (l suppose at Bampur) till his own appearance at the head of a sufficient army.I have also been asked by Misbah direct by telegram to press on Sardar Muhtasham his need of money. At your instance 500 tumans had already been asked for by me for the men at Bandar Abbas, but from no source does any cash appear to be forthcoming. Telegram, dated (and received) 5th May 1914.

He has had to contract debts to the extent of two thousand tumans on account of tents ordered and daily expenses and besides has spent four thousand tumans of his own money. He asks that he may be sent two thousand tumans at once to pay off the debts contracted on behalf of the Persiam Government at Chahbar and be given permission to return to Tehran via Constantinople.

He said he absolutely required him in order to get certain information from im. Sirdar Muhtasham who was present behaved very well and only insisted that he should leave Kerman with least possible delay. Ibrahim Khan called on me to-day and said that Lecoffre wrote to him that week to delay his return he, Lecoffre, should arrange matters in Kerman and then a week ago suddenly summoned him to come in. He also averred that Lecoffre had told him he had no orders from Mornard to turn him out. I have repeatedly reminded Lecoffre who has kept fatuously telling me that he could not get into communication with him. I shall take an early opportunity to tell him that if he distrusted Your Excellency’s message which I transmitted to him he should have at once address ed Mornard on the subject and that games of this kind are calculated to bring his career to a speedy termination.

I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 871, dated 24th March 1914 enquiring whether I could ascertain to what part of Baluchistan the raiders who recently threatened Bam belonged. 2. It is difficult to obtain any authentic information, but the following story was recently told to the Consulate Munshi by a servant of the Treasury Agent at Bam who has arrived at Bandar 'Abbas en route for Karbala, and I give it for what it is worth. He states that a “ kanat ” digger at Darzin saw three Baluchis approaching and hid himself in the “ kanat They sat down by the “ kanat ” and the digger for some time listened to their conversation, from which he learnt that one of them was a man called Aqa Shairdil and the other two his followers. Finally the digger crept out of the “ kanat ” and succeeded in killing all 3 of them, for which he was subsequently suitably rewarded by the Deputy- Governor of Bam. It was in order to revenge the death of Shairdil that the Baluchis looted Darzin. According to the Munshi’s informant Shairdil is a man of some consequence in the Sarhad, and all the Baluchis who invaded Kerman province came from Sarhad. This report must I think be accepted with consi derable reserve.

He did not land but went straight through to Chahbar. His Agent here had collected some 20 tufangchis but he told them to wait here for the present until he sent them instructions from Chahbar : he also said he had collected about 50 tufangchis at Bushire, but had not taken them with^ him. The Bakhtiari Sowars whom he expected from Kerman had not arrived owing, it seems, to some difficulty having arisen over the provision of funds for them.

I had conversation with Glimsted on April 8th when he cordially admitted that in view of my warnings, my verdict against him was the only one I could give, but he maintained that nowhere else could he find accommodation. I sug gested that he should try and imagine disputed quarters did not exist when doubtless some alternative would present itself to his mind, but I daresay there is real difficulty which to his lack of ingenuity appears insuperable. To-day he had telegram saying Your Excellency and myself had said that these quarters were necessary for Governor General and must be vacated. Glimsted has again appealed to me. I have replied game is entirely in Sardar Muhtasham’s hands and possibilities of negotiations seem to have passed, and that evacuation must come but perhaps with your aid a month’s respite might be obtained. I added that the longer the delay in evacuating the greater in my opinion the eventual humiliation. Glimsted has replied : “ I should , be very grateful to get so much respite as that. I could settle the matter myself with Sardar Muhtasham and think one month may be sufficient on assumption that he arrives in ten or twelve days”. Personally I think Glimsted’s hope of direct settlement with Sardar quite illusory but I have no hope of convincing him of this. I am anxious to do any thing in reason to retain Glimsted’s good will, which 1 at present enjoy, without unduly compromising myself towards the Sardar. I think respite scheme might effect this, though I do not think that it will be to the eventual advantage of the Gendarmes. Extract from Beuter's No. 55 , toords 145 , London, April 7th.

Lorimer, I.A., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General for Fars, Khuzistan, etc., Bushire. With reference to my telegram No. 13 of 3rd February 1914, I have the honour to forward enclosed a copy of the full text of Major Glimstedt’s letter No. 102, dated 1st February 1914, of which I gave a summary in that telegram. 2. I would take the opportunity of stating the circumstances which have led up to the present situation. _ t Crtr**' T &gt;7 / \ % ft 1X— From the moment when it was decided that the gendarmerie should be sent to Kerman Mr. Lecoffre openly assumed, and made capital out of the fact that the assistance of the gendarmerie would be available in every direction for the Finance Department. Judging that this was likely to impair their efficiency in road-protection His Majesty’s Consul in his telegram No. 133-188, dated id^h October 1913, referred to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, asking for a precise definition of the duties of the gendarmerie and of the exact nature of the assistance, if any, which Mr_ Lecoffre could require from them. His Majesty’s Minister replied in his telegram No. 85*361, dated 15th October 1913, to the general effect that the Finance Department had no legal claims whatever to the services of the gendarmerie whose one and only mission was to put and maintain in security the Kerman-Bander Abbas Trade Route. 3. Immediately after the arrival of the gendarmerie Mr. Lecoffre began proposing that the Swedish officers should take over, among other things, control of the City Police. The matter was discussed between Mr. Garnett, Secretary of His Majesty’s Legation, Captain de Mare, and His Majesty’s Consul at various places and on various occasions, and I think that Mr. Garnett also explained the views of His Majesty’s Legation personally to Major Glimstedt who was then confined to bed with enteric fever. Mr. Garnett stated with all clearness that His Majesty’s Minister would not willingly consent to any exten sion of the duties or responsibilities of the Swedish officers beyond those directly connected with the protection of the Kerman-Bander Abbas road. 4. Mr. Garnett left Kerman on November 5th, and I heard nothing more of the question until I received Mr. Lecoffre and Captain de Mate’s proposals, India, Fore oh Secrei arys No 3 .vl, dated 26 MAR 1914 C171FD2 T recorded in my diary of December 8th, paragraph 642 et seq, which seemed to indicate that the idea of the Swedish gendarmerie officers taking over charge of the local police had been abandoned. That this was not, however, the case was subsequently shown by Mr. Lecoffre’s announcement recorded in my diary, dated December 22nd, 1913, paragraph 660. After that I made various attempts to ascertain from Major Glimstedt, who had resumed charge about 20th Decem ber and was a guest in the Consulate, exactly how the matter stood, but I failed to obtain any clear statement from him and was unable even to decide whether he was purposely trying to keep me in the dark or whether his linguistic disabil ities prevented him from making himself intelligible. 5. In the course of the next few weeks from other sources and from himself I began to learn that Swedish officers were making some public display of interest in the affairs both of the police and of the regular troops. I accordingly as stated in my telegram No. 13, proceeded to make enquiries from various sources including Mr. Lecoffre and the Sardar Nusrat. With much difficulty I extracted from Mr. Lecoffre an admission that the Swedes had assumed a “ nominal supervision ” over the police while “ pourparlers ” on the subject were in progress in Tehran. I then received from Major Glimstedt his letter No. 100 of 20th January 1914, copy attached, and in turn 1 addressed to him my letter No. 78, dated 31st January 1914. of which I attach a copy and to which his letter under reference is the answer. In regard to his first letter I should remark that I believe that the Police “ Instructeurs actuedement en service dans la copitale ” are Swedes, and that officers trained by them would naturally look to their compatriots here for support. 6. For the last 10 days I have been confined to bed and forbidden to work by the doctor, and I have not yet decided in exactly what terms to reply to Major Glimstedt’s last letter. As the matter, however, appears to be under discus sion in Tehran and as Mr. Garnett’s warnings have apparently been entirely disregarded it seems improbable that any expostulations by me here will lead to any definite results. No. 100, dated January 29th, 1914. From—-M ajor Glimstedt, Commanding the IVth Regiment of the Gendarmerie Gouvernementale at Kerman, To—The His Majesty's Consul, Kerman. Monsieur le Consul, J’ai Fhonneur de vous envoyer ci joint un exemplaire “ Reglementdu service de la Gendarmerie Gouvernementale ”. En meme temps j’ai 1 ’honneur de vous avertir que j’ai propose a Teheran que pour chef de police ici on tache de trouver quelqu’un qui aura servi sous la direction des instructeurs actuellement en service dans la capitale, si toutefois il sera necessaire de faire un changement, ce que je ne pense nullement etre le cas, ^ Veuillez agreer, Monsieur le Consul, 1 ’assurance de ma consideration la plus distinguee. No. 78, dated the 31st January 1914. From—His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, To— Major Glimstedt, Commanding the IVth Regiment of the Gendarmerie Gouvernementale at Kerman. I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 100, dated the 29th January 1914, forwarding a copy of the Reglement. I have to thank you for informing me of the proposal you have submitted to Tehran in the event of the removal of the present Head of Police in Kerman, for which however you see absolutely no prospect of necessity arising. As matters stand at present I understand that you are exercising, with the ponsent of the local authorities concerned and the approval of the Finance Agent,Telegram No. 14, dated 2nd (received 7th) March 1914. p rom —His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, jo—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, (repeated Bushire No. 34). In continuation of my telegram 13-33. As far as I can judge, Sardar Nusrat’s complaints are justified and his powerlessness real. In similar circumstances I should resign. I shall however endeavour to induce him to maintain control of Kerman city.. He is the only tolerably satisfactory man available for the city Governor and an interregnum would probably lead to complications and disturbances in the town. My views on the situation remain those which I put forward m November, viz. if a Governor and force is not available means should be provided for im mediately raising levies from Kerman tribes whenever Baluchis begin to threaten. Of course there will be waste of money but that will be cheaper than repeated pillaging of country and caravans. Further virtual failure of gendarmerie has, I hear, damaged their prestige, and increasing trouble may consequently be anticipated from Baluchis who on authority of the Governor of Bam lost only 10 to 20 men which is more probable than 100 estimated by De Mare. I consider Lecoffre and the Swedes morally responsible for the present outrages by Baluchis in so far as their opposition has led to Kerman’s being left for four months without a strong Governor with an adequate military backing. I have all along impressed on them the responsibility resting on anyone who maintains that Kerman requires no outside Military force, Bakhtiari or other ; and I shall continue to do so. Telegram R., No. 14, dated (and received) 5th March 1914. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty’s Consul Kerman, (repeated Bushire No. 51). Your telegram 14. 1 approve your intention to endeavour to induce Sardar Nusrat to retain control of the town. Sardar Muhtasham is leaving for his post in two days.^ It is possible that Lecoffre’s representations may have influenced Mornard in delaying to arrange financial matters and that pressure of Swedes on Leconre mu-y have worked in same sense but I fancy the Sardar has himself been responsible in a very large measure. Until the last moment he hoped to oust Samsam from Isfahan and take his place and it was only after the latter s departure for his post that he set seriously to work to make his own preparations. I have impressed on Sardar the necessity of being on good terms with gen darmes and finance administration and shall urge upon heads of those two branches of the public service here the despatch of similar instructions to ^ eir representatives. 1 shall advise you further on these points after the Sardar has taken leave.

It appears that if we intended to take action we^ should have dorm so last year on similar charges continuously made by the Amir-i-Mufakham omcialiy as Governor General or when matter was up under the form of popular complain against the Finance Office in October from which Lecoffre was always personally (4) Telegram from His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 15, dated 4th Feb ruary 1914- (2) Telegram from His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No. 12, dated ist Feb ruary I 9 l 4 - (3) Telegram from His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, No. 4, dated ist February 1914. India, a copy of the telegrams, marginally noted, which have been received from His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, in regard to the relations between the Amir-i- Mufakham, lately Governor- General of that province, and excluded.I think that the effect of being impelled into action by discredited Amir now that he is in Tehran after having disregarded h.s official complaints for a year would be unhappy. His own (group undecypherable) and h,s own determined campaign against the Finance Office in October (group undecypherable ? 19.3) which were reasonable from him some months ago (seem?) extremely ungrace- In Vaio mrtnfVi nnw I have never doubted Ibrahim’s guilt at any rate in his early days here. But the Amir’s real object is to damage the Finance Department as a whole The witnesses named have all been at loggerheads with the Finance Office and The two first have now nominally made their peace but not the two last who were among the Amir’s main agents in October _ and have bad previous records. They have both in consequence had their pensions stopped by Lecoffre anrl orp verv hitter. The last is a man who is constantly making disturbances and defying all authority. He successfully defied the Amir himself but is now coquetting with the Sardar Muhtasham hoping to get him here to act as a protagonist against the discourteous Finance Department. He is a man who in my opinion ought to be deported. I consider it most undesirable that he as an arch-intriguer should be countenanced in any way by the Consulate and have always acted accordingly. Number 3 is only a few degrees better. No revenue official ought, in my opinion, to be condemned on verbal evidence given by the Amir or these people. Asa possible means of bringing about Ibrahim Khan s fall without identi* fying ourselves with the anti-Finance Department intrigue I would suggest that the Amir should be referred to the Persian Government and Mornard while the Persian Government might be reminded of its promises conveyed in your tele gram No. 87 which ultimately go back to my telegram No. j 31 and would neces sitate enquiry into Ibrahim Khan’s conduct. Lecoffre once gave me to understand that he did not trust Ibrahim Khan but that it was difficult for him to take steps against him because of the support he had in the head office in Tehran. If this true Lecoffre would probably not try to baulk a Government enquiry. Personally I have always expressed the opinion that Ibrahim Khan should be got rid of. If this suggestion does not commend itself to Your Excellency I will, when allowed by the doctor to get up, and on your specific instructions, consult the persons mentioned except Number 1 who has gone as Governor to Rafsinjan under protest from a section of the population on account of his previous extortions. But I would deprecate giving them assurances of protec tion which would put the Consulate in extremely equivocal position towards the two worst characters of Kerman ; I do not think they would demand them.

All I wished to ascertain was whether in your opinion it would be justifiable and expedient to advise Mornard to order searching enquiry to be made into Ibrahim jk/sfl* 43 Khan’s conduct. I dropped the action I had commenced against him previously because I understood from you that the charges against him were probably exaggerated. Given the characters of the persons quoted by the Amir it would appear to me undesirable that you should be mixed up in any enquiry in which they would be concerned and you could not of course give such people assurances. Former leaves matter to the Persian Government and Mornard but of course nothing will be done unless I insist upon it. Amir appears to be on excellent terms with Mornard.”— Ends. I was unaware that the Minister had ever contemplated action against Ibrahim Khan. My repeated recommendations for his removal had in every case been ignored. I have no recollection nor can I find any record of having said anything to discourage action. I am considering how to reply.

Extracts from Consult Kerman's diary for the week ending 8th December igi3&gt; » * * 642. Mr. Lecoffreani Captain de Mare called on His Majesty’s Consul on the 2nd instant. Mr. Lecoffre had changed his attitude in regard to the subsidising of the Sardar Nusrat. He now said that 10,000 tomans a month was paid for the maintenance of the regular troops and the roadguards in the province. The bulk of this sum passed into the hands of the Sardar Nusrat, and his brother Adl-us-Sultan. For the Karasuran on the Yazd the allowance exceeded 1,000 tomans. These funds, if properly expended, should amply suffice for maintaining all forces necessary for the preservation of order. His Majesty’s Consul was inclined to agree, but expressed surprise that these facts and this point of view had not been placed before him at the beginning by the Chief Financial Authority. 643. Mr. Lecoffre then proceeded to introduce a proposal which he had already communicated privately to Mr. Garnett when the latter was ere. is was for the appointment of one, or if possible, more than one, European o cer, in whose hands should be centred the financial and tactical contro 0 a e armed forces in the province excepting the gendarmerie. This would save me immense leakage of funds at present going on, and lead to the organisation 0 a more than visionary and tolerably reliable force. Afterwards these orces would all be amalgamated with the Road gendarmerie. 644. His Majesty’s Consul replied that, while full European control appear ed to offer the only hope of bringing the Persian Public Services into a state of practical efficiency and of stopping the wastage of public funds, he did not believe that any scheme for putting the whole armed force 0 e coun ry European hands would ever be accepted by the Persian Coyemment, or that His Majesty’s Legation would be inclined to press for its adoption. • sion had been made to European immediate requirements by the creation of the gendarmerie as a separate force under European command to pro ec cI ■■ITT ;; til i trade routes. The European Powers were not immediately interested in the manner in which Persia chose to expend its resources, so long as the interest on loans was paid up and the gendarmerie adequately financed. he 645. De Mare’s wishes were somewhat different from Mr. Lecoffre’s. He ^ said that when there was a Bakhtiari force in Kerman, some 20,000 tomans was^ being paid per mensem for the armed forces in the province. The bulk of this was wasted and misappropriated. The whole, or a portion of it could be much more usefully expended by the gendarmerie. More funds, which they could not look for to Tehran, would enable them to render their force efficient at a much earlier date, and so the present “ dangerous period ” when the gendarmerie was weak and little more than a name, would be curtailed. He repudiated any desire to extend the responsibility of the gendarmerie by taking over the duties of other forces or departments. stai 646. His Majesty’s Consul expressed doubts as to the advantages to be gained by attempting to rush on the organisation of the gendarmerie even if additional funds would help towards that end. De Mare said that another Swedish officer, or several if possible, was a great desideratum. This no doubt is a fact. Extracts from Consul y Kerman's diary for the week ending 22nd December 660. Reference paragraph 643. Mr. Lecoffre called on His Majesty’s Consul, on the 20th instant, and informed him that he had received a telegram from Tehran stating that the supervision of the Kerman City Police was to be entrusted to the Swedish Gendarme officers. This is an old ambition of Mr. Lecoffre’s, dating from the time that he first heard of the appointment of Swedes to Kerman. 661. He reckons that the measure will strengthen the local Chief of the Police, and enable him to disregard orders from the Governor to give free license to privileged agitators, such as those issued by the Amir-i-Mufakham in October. This may be a fact, but it will also provide cause for friction between the Swedes and the Governor, which the former’s brains and tact may be insufficient to over come. A Governor who has no full control of his headquarters’ police, whether for pious or nefarious purposes, is really in a somewhat undignified and anomalous position, which he may be expected to resent. I' 'CO tons 2 fjiisledfsrei His Majesty’s Consul does not, however, consider either Mr. Lecoffre’s or Captain de Mare’s proposals to be urgently necessary from the point of view of British interests, or likely to be possible of realisation. He does not, therefore— propose to put them forward formally with a recommendation, and contents himself with mentioning them here.

I made renewed ennninps fmm T Mnc-t-of onrl Fnmnpansin ei 1(9 Coj Otitis3 supervision ” of the police and some interest in the regular force. Lecoffre is, of course, the moving spirit in this and, as he knows that it is not likely to receive our approval, he is studiously uncandid with me. Having thus felt my way I addressed Glimstedt officially begging that he would kindly inform me exactly on what footing these matters now stood, and I at once received a full and straightforward statement of which the following is a summary : — (1) Police .—Two months ago Lecoffre proposed that Glimstedt should take over the command of the Police. Sardar Nusrat agreed and telegraphed to Tehran. Glimstedt expressed willingness to do so in principle but asked for time to study the question before (giving ?) decisive reply. The present “ nomi nal supervision ” consists in the Chief of Police coming to Glimstedt’s office for consultations and in the Police joining the gendarmes in their weekly review. Re-organisation of the Police demands European control. No need for special officer to be deputed since with some loyal Persian subordinates the Officer-Instructors of the gendarmerie will be able to undertake the work. Glimstedt’s requirement is that Tehran should send down suitable Persian subordinates, and that the administration of the Police should be placed under control, at least financial, of the gendarmerie. (2) Army .—Lecoffre claimed military protection for State properties. Sar dar Nusrat applied to Tehran for the necessary arms and ammunition but received no reply to the application, Glimstedt telegraphed to his Chief asking for arms and ammunition and selected officers and requiring that arms and ap pointed officers should be put in his hands. Such arrangement only temporary because when the gendarmerie (are ?) fully established on the Kerman-Bandar Abbas and Kerman-Shiraz routes, Glimstedt intends to undertake the protection of life and property off the trade routes in which case there will exist no raison d'etre for either army or road guards; but in the meantime treasury must be protected. Should SardaPs demands be rejected by Tehran, Glimstedt holds that both road guard and army budgets should be transferred to the gendarmerie. This would enable the gendarmerie to make “ peaceful demonstrations ” throughout the countryside with the happiest results. Summary ends. All these proposals have been put in to Tehran without my being consulted, except so far as reported in my diary paragraphs 642 to 646 and announcement from Glimstedt two days ago that he had recommended the appointment of European trained Chief of Police for Kerman from Tehran if a change were made. The whole thing’s absolute folly. I shall, as soon as possible, call Glimstedt’s and perhaps Lecoffre s atten tion to the fact that the mission of the gendarmerie in Kerman is wholly and solely the protection of the Bandar Abbas trade route. Towards this we do not seem to have made much progress yet. Enclosure No. 3.

As regards gendarmes’ functions, I am afraid I had misunderstood Mr. Garnett and got the idea that any extension of their sphere of activity beyond road work would be strongly disapproved by His Britannic Majesty’s Legation. Hence my doubts. I remain, however, of opinion that for the time being the road work alone will give them more than sufficient to do. When they knew that under a misapprehension I was opposed to their pro posals and that they were secure of support by their Chiefs in Tehran, I can scarcely blame Lecoffre and Glimstedt for seeking to go behind me and so avoid ing unnecessary friction.Sir W.

After fighting all one day, the gendarmes drew off to await reinforcements and ammunition; not being strong enough in numbers to contain Baluchis, the latter slipped away. The gendarmes lost two killed and two wounded. The Baluchi losses are estimated at 100. Swedish officers here think operation will have had a good effect, and is calculated to encourage recruiting.

[5861] ! !9!4 No. 1. Sir TT . Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 9.) {No. 8. Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, Januai'y 10, 1914. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a Confidential despatch which I have received from His Majesty’s Consul at Kerman, upon the subject of the increasing prevalence of Baluchi raids that not only threaten towns in which there are considerable British carpet weaving interests, but even the city of Kerman itself. Captain Lorimer points out with much reason that the situation is fast becoming an intolerable one when Baluchi raiders not only threaten the Kerman-Bunder Abbas trade route in large numbers, but even might menace the town of Kerman itself in the absence of the Governor-General, should that official at a critical moment be absent with the bulk of his forces in some other part of the province. The remedy for this unsatisfactory state of things lies, Captain Lorimer appears to think, in offensive operations into Persian Baluchistan, but he rightly considers that no good purpose would be served by such an expedition unless the necessary steps were taken to secure the establishment of a permanent administration in Persian Baluchistan under a capable Governor, who should be independent of the Governor-General of Kerman, and be provided with such a military force as would enable him to maintain order and put a stop to raiding. Such an arrangement is highly desirable, but Captain Lorimer proceeds to point out in his despatch all the difficulties that attend the execution of such a plan under existing conditions. An expedition under a Bakhtiari Governor-General would, he shows, be of a purely ephemeral nature, with, as its main object, the amassing of as much plunder as possible by the leader. And yet with a Bakhtiari Governor-General there is at least some chance that some punitive measures can be undertaken, because the Bakhtiari khans are always accompanied by a certain military force of their own tribesmen. Nothing but a purely defensive attitude could be assumed by any other Governor-General that the Persian Government would be likely to send to Kerman, because he would have no force, beyond the somewhat unreliable levies he could raise locally, to oppose to the Baluchi raiders. The present Governor-General, Serdar Mohtashem Bakhtiari, who has not left Tehran, has had the Baluch question seriously under consideration in concert with the Minister of the Interior, and contemplates undertaking a military expedition, on which he hopes to secure the co-operation of at least a small gendarmerie force, which would, with his own sowars, provide a backbone for the local troops that he will have to recruit for the purpose. The Serdar does not, however, propose to trust to the sword alone, but has already despatched a peace emissary in the person of Misbah-i-Diwan, a former Governor of Bunder Abbas, to treat with the Baluch leaders, with a view to reaching, if possible, a compromise that will enable an administration to be established without fighting. Misbah-i-Diwan claims to enjoy great influence with the Baluch chiefs, but I much doubt if his diplomatic mission will achieve much useful result. It is, however, I think, a good sign that an effort should be made to come to a friendly settlement of a question that is fraught with many difficulties. I have caused parts of Captain Lorimer’s despatch to be communicated to the Minister of the Interior, who has informed me, in reply, that he intends, as soon as such a course may be feasible, to separate Persian Baluchistan from Kerman, and to send an independent Governor to it, either from Tehran or elsewhere, but his Highness added that this cannot be done until there is a strong force of gendarmerie in the province of Kerman. It would be idle to suppose that the small gendarmene foice now in Kerman will become strong enough to undertake the task of pacifying Peisian Baluchistan just at present, but from their exploits on the Bushire—Shiiaz load and elsewhere in Northern Persia, I think we may fairly anticipate that they will icndei a better account of themselves than Captain Lorimer would appear to anticipate. As regards the final proposal contained in Captain Lorimer s despatch, namely, [2044 ;- 2 ] TSItys. nr m I Copy i Of ^ a FEB 1914 ( r' /Othat if the Persian Government is unable to cope with the situation itself it should be urged to invite the Indian Government to do so, I w'ould venture to suggest that two blacks do not make one white, and that the fact that circumstances have obliged the Russian Government to undertake very costly operations in the protection' of their political interest and trade in Northern Persia is not a reason why the Indian^ Government should take similar measures in another part of Persia, where not very important British interests are only distantly threatened. Moreover, it would, I think, be only fair to give the Persian Government a little more time to develop an organisation, the gendarmerie, that may succeed within the next year or two in bringing about the desired establishment of a stable form of government in Persian Baluchistan. I have, &amp;c. WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Consul Lorimer to Sir W. Townley. Kerman, November 26, 1913. I HAVE the honour to bring forw r ard for consideration the question of the raiding by Baluchis into Kerman territory, and of the administration of the province of Persian Baluchistan. 2. It is unnecessary for me to deal with the origin of the existing situation. The course of events in recent years may be traced in Major Sykes’s w r ork “ Ten Thousand Miles through Persia,” and in the despatches and diaries of various consuls, concluding with those of my immediate predecessor, Lieutenant-Colonel Haig, C.M.G. 3. The total absence of any semblance of government in Baluchistan and the constant raids by its tribes into the neighbouring districts of Bam and Narmashir, not to mention forays further afield towards Khurasan, are sufficiently familiar. Also they do not ordinarily jeopardise to any serious extent British interests. In the present year, however, Baluchi activities have become less innocent from the British point of view. The district of Khabis, only three stages from Kerman city, was raided on more than one occasion, and Rawar, a weaving centre in which much foreign capital is engaged, was actually attacked. The raiders were beaten off with some loss of life on both sides, but a little more determination on the part of the Baluchis would have carried the day and a loss of thousands and thousands of pounds would have resulted to British subjects and proteges. 4. Not less serious in its potentialities, and very serious in its actual results, was the big Baluchi raid in May last into the country between Kerman and Bam. The districts of Tahrud, Darzin, and Marghak were stripped, and a large caravan on its wa y up from Bunder Abbas, with goods principally belonging to British Indian subjects, was gutted. The loss to us in this one episode was some 15,700 tomans odd, and it was only by a dispensation of Providence, or some similar force, that a caravan bringing specie for the Imperial Bank of Persia and accompanied by British subjects did not fall into their hands. 5. On this occasion, moreover, in the absence of the Governor-General with all available forces in Aqta Afshar, there was absolutely nothing to prevent the raiders coming straight on and pillaging Kerman city. It appears certain that they were not less than 600 in number, and it was probably only because they were glutted and lacked heart that they stayed their course and returned to their country. Since then we have had the raids into Khabis and Rawar already referred to, and a succession of forays into Narmashir and the vicinity of Bam. At the present time Bam and the villages of Narmashir are being daily menaced with devastation. 6. Such have been the circumstances of the year, and the question naturally follows: What steps have been taken to obtain reparation and to abate the Bahich nuisance ? The answer is: Almost nothing. As regards recoveries, nothing can be done without a punitive expedition, but an expedition was, in my opinion, not a thing to be undertaken with existing resources or under the auspices of a man like the Amir Mufakhkkam, who would only design and carry out such an undertaking in a way that would transfer the maximum of Government funds and of Baluch rv u Ho (No. 29. Confidential.)property into his own pockets without producing any permanent amelioration of the situation. I therefore abstained from pressing the authorities for the recovery of compen sation for the goods carried off at Marghak and Sarvistan, and even declined to interest ^nyself in trying to bring about a Baluchistan expedition for which the Amir Mufakh- kham was very insistent. His tour round the home districts had been a political necessity in order to re-establish the prestige of the Government in the parts of the country crossed by our trade routes, and on which the prosperity of Kerman is immediately dependent, but the same immediate necessity did not exist in the case of Baluchistan. 7. Nevertheless, the settlement of the Baluchi question is necessary, and it should he made of a permanent nature. The Baluch have been trying their strength, notably during the present year, and that they have the strength not only to sack Bam as well as the surrounding^districts, but also to make the western and hitherto safer route to Bunder Abbas via Deh Bakri impossible, and to loot Rawar, and even Kerman itself, during the absence of a Governor with a strong following like that of the Amir Mufakhkham, is beyond question. The only thing lacking so far is initiative and audacity. 8. It will be argued that the gendarmerie will be able to protect the Deh Bakri or any other route selected, and to guarantee the safety of Kerman city. This may be so in the course of time, but it is certainly beyond their power at present. To guarantee the safety of the road from Kerman to Deh Bakri, some 120 miles, on which the Baluch can at any time bring their full strength to bear, will require a large force. Prestige, when acquired, will reduce the force necessary, but the gendarmes have still their name to make, and any set-back or disaster will have a most damaging effect. The maintenance of a large force specially to counter the Baluch menace will in the long run be uneconomical. As regards Kerman, the presence of more than a gendarmerie depot in the city itself would be wasteful and inexpedient 9. It therefore seems to me that the Baluch evil should be attacked more directly and nearer the root. One step to this end would be the location of a cordon of Persian troops on the east frontier of Bam, and perhaps of Narmashir. As a move in this direction, I recommended earlier in the year that financial provision be made for the maintenance of a small mounted force by the Governor of Bam {vide my telegram No. 39/127, dated the 19th July, 1913). This was done, but it was only a trifling measure, whose chief value lay in its possible moral effect. In any case defensive measures, taken only to avoid offensive ones, are usually found in the long run to be expensive and unsatisfactory. Witness our policy on the north western frontier of India during the lift} 7 years preceding the revision of methods introduced by Lord Curzon. 10. I am therefore of opinion that the Baluchistan problem should be tackled by measures of- offence. But measures of offence are, in themselves, worthless or prejudicial unless they are merely the precursors of permanent administrative ones. It is no use paying the Baluch in their own coin, by mustering with difficulty a sufficient Persian force under Persian leaders, raiding the country, emptying it of stock and cash, and then withdrawing. This is what the Amir Mufakhkham would have done had he been able. The result would have been an impoverishment of the people, with a corresponding increase of criminality, and a sense of wrong with a desire for revenge which would find a vent for itself in renewed raiding and reprisals. 11. If Baluchistan is to be entered, it should be entered not again to be vacated by the Persian Government. A sufficient force should be raised to penetrate the country and establish a Government. A capital should be founded by the building of quarters and barracks, and a Governor set down in it with a sufficient force. Forts should be constructed in selected centres and garrisons established. The force should be commanded preferably by someone who was not going to be appointed Governor, and should be accompanied by European officers, whether Swedes or others, to see that only reasonable political and pecuniary demands and arrange ments were made. Efficiently and justly administered, the province should pay its own way. 12. It would probably be best that it should be separated from Kerman, and the local Governor be given full independent authority. Kerman and Baluchistan, especially with the new complications of European management of the revenue and the gendarmerie, form too large a charge for one man. It will be said that Persian troops cannot exist in Baluchistan, and that no one* 4 will be found to accept the post of Governor. I believe this to be humbug. With properly built quarters in selected localities I question whether Baluchistan would he found in any special degree unhealthy. The Baluchis themselves appear to be healthy and active enough. Due attention paid to water supply, medical services, and proper quarters would, I believe, obviate all real cause of complaint. It would also probably be possible to draw largely on the Baluchis themselves for troops. They appear to be sufficiently divided up among themselves to make it perfectly possible to raise a mixed force sufficiently trustworthy for the work required of it. 13. As regards a Governor, with a salary guaranteed by the Finance Department, and pickings which he would still make, I do not doubt that a man could be found. If he were not one of the Tehran-bred “ruling caste,” so much the better in all probability. 14. If the Persian Government is incapable of governing Baluchistan, I believe the British Government could do it for it with a small force of local levies and a handful of Indian Army officers, and could square the account from the local revenues. I speak, however, without any personal knowledge of the country or its people, and this question would require investigation on the spot. 15. In conclusion, I would urge that the Persian Government be pressed to take effective steps to re-establish its authority in Baluchistan before matters reach a more serious point, and that if they are, or express themselves, unequal to the task, they should be required to commission the British Government to undertake it for them. In the latter case I believe that, by a gradual introduction of British officials and the raising of local levies, Baluchistan could in course of time be reduced to order without any formal expedition. 16. From the point of view of international politics, I presume that when Russia keeps thousands of Russian troops in Northern Persia we may without offence take such mild and tentative steps as these last proposed. We may surely exert ourselves to put a stop to anarchy existing on the frontier of India, threatening and actually damaging our most valuable interests in our own “ sphere ” of Persia, especially when this anarchy prevails in a remote corner of the country which is isolated in every way from the^ general [sphere of Persian politics, and in which no European Power save ourselves^has any interest, direct or indirect.

I have the honour to urge on Your Excellency the desirability of a readjust ment of the boundary of the provinces of Kerman and Pars with a view to bringing the Kerman-Bandar Abbas road entirely and sufficiently within Kerman and Bandar Abbas territory. 2. As the boundary is at present situated the road has to pass through Pars territory over a considerable portion of the country lying between Gulashgird and Faryah. In the absence of any map showing the boundary accurately, or of means of getting precise information about a matter of which no one except perhaps the immediate residents have any exact knowledge, it is impossible for me to be more explicit. The general fact is however certain, and it is and wall continue to be a constant source of trouble in arranging for the protection of traffic on the road. It is an unnecessary problem which should be spared the Gendarmerie. 3. I would therefore recommend that steps should be taken to obtain the acquiescence of the Persian Government, and that a British Officer should be appointed to conduct a survey of the tract in question, and that a new alignment to secure the object in view should be fixed by the Persian Government with the approval of Commanding Officer of the Gendarmerie and His Majesty’s Con sulate. 4. There is also a further question of the same nature presented by the district of Shahr-i-Babak further north. It does not affect the road to Bandar Abbas but is alleged as a source of lawlessness in Sirjan. From the Kerman point of view it is represented that this district, which I understand is included in Pars, naturally and geographically belongs to Kerman, and that its alienation facilitates the perpetration with impunity of raids into Kerman territory bv its inhabitants, who appear to be of a lawless habit of life. This problem might also be investigated on the spot, and dealt with, if a satisfac* tory solution appeared possible. S Any rectification of boundary should only be carried out with all due formality and they should be supported by reasonably accurate maps and durable boundary marks, otherwise they will probably be soon ignored and then forgotten.

From—His Majesty's Consul, Kerman, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, (repeated Resident 228).

Fight has taken place near Rigan in which one of the Governor’s headmen was killed. Governor has applied Bam for assistance saying he is hard pressed. Baluchis have long been threatening this and an advance on Bam and to wards Kerman. Special financial provision to furnish, if possible, a repelling force probably will be necessary.

From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Resident, Bushire, No. 219.) Brojther of Sardar Nusrat informed me privately to-day that agitation against the Sard*ar Muhtasham is still simmering and Sardar Nusrat ds being hard pres sed by leaders of the people but had refused to join in in any way in opposition to wish of Consulate. His position is however difficult. In reply to definite question, I said I had no objection to people telegraph- in^ what they pleased direct to the Persian Government but they must not make disturbances or approach Consulate which had nothing to modify in final answer already given. Sardar should quell any disturbancss by force, if necessary. Does Your Excellency approve ? Discontent is led by richer classes which is natural and by Mullahs. I think Sardar Nusrat and family, though, of course, hostile to a Bakhtian and really wanting the power for themselves, are taking no part in movement remembering the lesson of last year. Ibrahim Khan of the Finance Department is also asserted by Sardar’s bro ther to be a prime mover which is probable as there is no doubt that he and Lecoffre are both dead against any Bakhiiari, and though Garnett spoke strongly on the subject to Lecoffre, latter is probably working subterraneously. If I were to accuse him he would, of course, deny charge, and I cou.d not prove it against him or his assistant. Garnett also spoke to Swedes who are similarly anti^ Bakhtiarir— ^ _ I India, Foreign Secretary’s ; \VE0 No 1 M, dated (' 17 J AN t Sl 41Enclosure No. 2. Telegram R., No. 158, dated the 15th (received l6th) November 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, jo—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Resident, Bushire, No. 220.) Sardar Nusrat’s brother informs me six weeks ago Acting Russian Consul had approached former with proposal that he should obtain a Russian decora tion for him. No reason for offer was given. Sardar deferred answering, and alleges to me that he does not want to accept Russian decoration. He suggests that if he is approached again he should report that he cannot accept without permission of Persian Uovernment, adding later, if necessary, that permission has been refused. He asked for my approval or advice, I replied I had no objection to course proposed. It may be that whole story is only ruse to induce us to give him a decora tion which might be prophylactic against Bakhtiaris. I made no sign apprecia ting this possibility. Enclosure No. 3. Telegram R., No. 159, dated (and received) the 17th November 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Resident, Bushire, No. 221.) Sardar Nusrat complains he can get no answer from Sardar Muhtasham to request for authority to appoint Governor for Rafsinjan. He rightly points out matter is urgent as security Yazd road is at stake, and Rafsinjan is also postal centre through w r hich all Kerman posts pass. Enclosure No. 4. Telegram R., No. 160, dated (and received) the 17th November 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Resident, Bushire, No. 222.) I send Your Excellency following report merely for information and for what it may be worth. People of Kerman are saying Bakhtiaris are meditating a coup of some sort and intend to meet at Ispahan and arrange matters there. They have come to understanding with Sowlet-ul-Mulk (sic) and can count on co-operation of Kashgais. Nature of coup is not openly stated, but is understood to be restoration of Muhammad Ali Shah It is credibly said that people of Kerman and Ears w’ould be in favour of restoration. This design on the part of Bakhtiaris pre sumably involves overthrow of Finance Department and gendarmerie. This is said to account for tame way in which Bakhtiari took gendarme affair in Tehran, and for Amir Mufakham suddenly wilfully playing the fool here, and then leaving province quietly without doing any serious damage. Enclosure No. 5. Telegram R., No. 99, dated (and received) the 18th November 1913. From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman. (Repeated Resident, Bushire, No. 39 1 ‘) Your telegram* No. 160. I can quite understand in provinces people do ^ , not know true state of things. ♦Rnrlncnrp Nn. A ante. ^3 Bakbtiaris are not meditating any coup either at Ispahan or elsewhere. Muhammad Ali is politically asJSXtinct as the dodo, and Sowlet will very likely be deposed from Ilkhaniship of Kashgais in spring as he appears to have lost his authority over the tribesmen. Amir Mufakham came away quietly : he is a wise man and knows that his best chance of getting his money is by keeping on good terms with me. Enclosure No. 6. Telegram R., No. 163, dated the 25 th (received 27th) November 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repated Resident, Bushire No. 225.) Your telegram No. 101. Yes, a few days ago Lecoffre issued fresh notice announcing the imposition of vehicle tax but mentioning no date. I wrote enquiring the date proposed for commencing collection, but I have received no answer from him. Enclosure No. 7. Telegram R., No. 164, dated the 27th (received 28th) November 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Resident, Bushire, No 226.) Your telegram No. 301. I interviewed Lecoffre yesterday. He says he has never received orders from any source to suspend introduc- tion of animal tax. Until your above mentioned telegram to myself I had only heard from late Governor-General of a vague order of suspension. I aske Sardar Nusrat recently and he said he had no instructions. Lecoffre says yearly licenses are already being applied for and paid for by people without any sign of opposition in any quarter. He did not propose to introduce immediately collection at the gates from non-residents. In these circumstances, I would strongly deprecate any retrograde action. Enclosure No. 8. Telegram R., No. 165, dated the 27th (received 28th) November 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated^Resident, Bushire, No. 227.) Sardar Nusrat asks for financial provision for a mounted force of 200 men and ammunition. This seems to me necessary and in view of withdrawal of Amir Mufakham s 5 or 600 sowars, logical. I have discussed matter with Lecoffre and we agree that Government should sanction monthly expenditure of 2,500 tomans as a temporary measure and purchase some 5&gt; 000 cartridges.
