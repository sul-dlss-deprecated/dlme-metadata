One of the methods suggested for the verification of doubtful claims is reference to baptismal certificates. As a result of represent tions made on behalf of the Anglo-Indian and Domiciled European Association the Government of India have reason to doubt whether baptismal certificates can always be reg'-r^crl as a satisfa ctory me-' ns of v .rif ic ti on. It h^.s therefore been decide 1 tVr,t in future appointing autho- i rities should not ^ccept baptismal certificates in verifi cation yf doubtful claims of can^i r1 ' tes to be Anglo-Indians. 2. In order further to guar- 1 against the appointment to v cancios reserved for Anglo-Indians of persons f'.lsely claim ing to belmg to th r t community it has been ceciced that in t future any person who applies for -^nd obf ins r. vacancy reserved frr '-'in /jigl--Indian by furnishing false information shall be disqualified, or if app-inter', shall be liable to removal from service, as soon as the fact c.mes tn notice. 3.

It has been ruled that the India Office or the High Commissioner for India, as the case m^y be, is in lav respon sible for assessing and collecting tax on all payments made by either in respect of the year of charge, such payments inclu- overseas pay, ding leave pay #^remittances and allotments of pay and also arrears of pay Issued in respect of that year, but not arrears of pay, etc*, relating to previous years* Advances drawn in the United Kingdom in respect of pay due after the date of embarication on return to India will continue to be exempt from liability to British Income Tax* In the case of officers taking up residence In Great Britain or Vorthem Ireland on retirement, or while on leave — pending • ]pending retirement* no liability to tax will arise in respect of payments made by the India Office or the High Commissioner for India prior to the date of arrival for the purpose of taking up residence in cases where a home has not previously been main tained in either of those countries. As regards Provident Pund balances, no liability to United Kingdom tax fcill be claimedi- (a) where the balance is paid in rupees in India, whether the proceeds are remitted to the United Kingdom or not, or (b) where the balance is paid in sterling, provided that,* in the case where the sterling payment is made in the United CUx. fhudt. ft (fcc IUA^A4^UC Kingdom, it is effected^by means of a sterling bill sent ^ by the Account Officer in India through an iSxchange Bank in the United Kingdom. The following notes are intended as a guide to the basis of assessment of remittances to the United Kingdom out of pay arising in Indiai- (l) Officers visiting the United Kingdom while on leave or privilege leave or leave on average pay and becoming liable as residents in the United Kingdom for the year of visit. (a) where pay is issued in India in respect of the whole period of the visit, (e.g., in the case of an officer visiting the United Kingdom while on privilege leave or leave on average pay on pay drawn in India), the liability for the year of it is normally on the basis of the remittances made to or received in the United Kingdom preceding year, where, however, remittances out of Indian pay are first made to or received in the United Kingdom in t a «tyear of visit, or m tn. P'o.a lw o. a „ „ 6th ln tlij Jiir tt. liability of .. , hl Wil&lt; ^ ^ actual remittance of the year of visit. *1 f - TV- t/aj ri'/ -- &lt; b )(b) no pay is issued in India in respect of the Income Tax year in which the officer is chargeable as a resident or where pay is so issued in respect of a period oommen- cing after 6th April in the said year, no liability will arise in respect of remittances out of pay earned in India prior to the year of visit. (c) Where pay is issued in India in respect of part only of the Income Tax year of visit, i.e., where the full pay due becomes a charge on the funds of the India Office or the High Commissioner for India from tkm 7th April or some later date in that year, the liability for that year in respect of remittances is on the remittances of the year of visit. In none of the cases falling within (l) will the combined totals of the assessments on leave salary, allotments (or ovef- seas ;ay ; and remittances out of pay arising in India exceed the full pay for the year of visit. (2) Officers going to th0 United Kingdom on retirement or on leave pending retire ment with the intention of taxing up residence there, or for transfer to the Hame establishment. (a) Where the date of arriTal in the United Kingdom is not v. itiiip t.ie period for which pay has been issued in India liability in respect of remittances. (b) Where the date of arrival in the United Kingdom is within the period for which pay has been issued in India and ji the date up to which such pay has been calculated is within , the year of arrival, liability will arise in respect of all remittances out of pay made to the United Kingdom in the year of arrival whether they reach the United Kingdom ,, Ufore or after the date of arrival. The liability will be restricted, however, so as not to charge a sum greater tnan the proportion appropriate* to the period from thedate of arriyal to the end of the year of arriTal, of the pay arising in India in that year. (c) Where the date of arrival in the United Kingdom ie within the period for which pay has been issued in India but the date up to which such pay has been calculated is in the year following the year of arrival, the liability for the year of arrival, if there have been remittances out of pay in pre vious years, will normally be on the basis of the remittances reacning the United Kingdom in the year preceding the year of arrival, unless such remittances are less than the remit tances reaching the United Kingdom in the year of arrival (whether before or after arrival) when the latter will form the basis of assessment. Where in such a case remittances have not been made in previous years, the assessment will in any case be based on the remittances of the year of arrival (^hetheyieaching the United Kingdom before or after arrival). Moreover whether the •'preceding* or the ^current 11 year basis applies, the assessment will if necessary be restricted to the proportion appropriate to the period from the tia date of arrival to the end of the year of arrival of the full arising in Indi* ; for the b-sic^year. The liability for the year of assessment following the year of arrival is on the basis of the whole of the remittances arriving in the United lingdom in the year of assesement but the aeseesment will be restricted if neoesBary sootaix® to the full amount of pay arising in India in that year. United Kingdom Income-tax. Visitors from the Dominions and yoreign countries The following is an outline of the position of visitors to the United Kingdom who are not domiciled there and who may incur liability to United Kingdom lncome-ta*»i -(1) Liability to tax on income arising in the United Kingdom. All income arising from sources vithin the United Kingdom (nith the exception of interest from certain / Government securities such as the 5% War Loau Stocit, 1929-47, to which special privileges are attacned) is chargeable to United Kingdom Income Tax, (2) Liability to tax on income arising abroad. Fo part of a visitor's income from sources outside the United King dom is subject to United Kingdom Income Tax unless he is chargeable as a person residing in the United Kingdom. The circumstances in which he may become so chargeable and the e-xtent of his liability are indicated below* (3) What constitutes ''residence *. (a) A visitor who maintains no place of abode in the United Kingdom and whose visits are not habitual but occasional only is not regarded as resident in the United Kingdom unless he has been in the United Kingdom for a period or periods equal in the whole to six months in the Income Tax year (begmaing 6th April). (b) U, however, ne maintains a place of abode in the United Kingdom, available for his use, he is regarded as resi dent for any year in *hioh he pays a visit, of whatever length, to the United Kingdom. vc; Moreover, even though he does-not maintain a place of aoode in the United Kingdom available for his use, and does not stay for six months in any one year, he is re garded as becoming resident if he visits the United kingdom year after year (so that his visits become in effect part of his habit of life) and the annual visits are for a substantial period or periods of time. The question of residence in any particular case can- 6 - only be determined by reference to the facts of the case. But it can be said that the Board of In^land Revenue would normally regard an average annual period or periods amount ing to three months as 'substantial 11 and the visits as having become M babitual M after 4 years. And, where the visitors arrangements indicated from the start that regular visits for substantial periods were to be made 9 he would be regarded as resident in and from the first year. 4# B^tent of liability to tax on income arising abroad : A visitor who thus becomes chargeable as a resident is liable not on the whole of his income arising a byroad but only on so much of that income as is received in or remitted to the United Kingdom. In order to assist intending visitors in ascertaining their position the Board of Inland Revenue will be glad to express their opinion on the fa^ts of any esse being submitted to them by letter addressed to the Secretary, Board of Inland Revenie , Somerset House, London, W.C.2. It should be added that a visitor who is charged to Income Tax in respect of his income arising aoroad has the right of appeal to the Appeal Commissioners and , on a point of law, to the Courts, both on the question of resi dence and on the question of the amount of the Income Tax liabi lity . ■ ■ ■ - ■ * Hote 1. - A special arrangement with regard to Income Tax exists between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State and this memorandum, so far as it deals with the extent of liability to United Kingdom Income tax, must not be taken as applicable to persons resident or income arising in the Irish Free State. 9 Jiote.2. - The British Goirernment securities to the interest on which the special privileges referred to are attached, now C.»o.l34 - I.T./38.

Nor would it be proper pending dubbing or conferment by Letters Patent in the case of a person designated a Knight-Bachelor to indicate the title by the use of the letters 'Kt.' after his name. The position is however different in the case of the Orders. Thus a person who has been designated e.g. K.CUI.E. would correctly be referred to as 'Mr. X .Y*Z, K.G.I•E.', unless by virtue of being a Knight-Bachelor he is already entitled to the use of the title 'sir'.

The number of vacancies that may be po filled is also not known at present. All vacancies will be filled in accordance with the instructions in the Hom^ De partment Resolution No. F.-14/17-B/ 33-Ests., dated the 4th July, 1934 It is expected that besides other vacancies there will be about twenty vacancies to be filled by lady candi dates.

(f) Successful candidates will be medically examined before confirma tion in Government service to ensure that they have no disease, constitutional weakness or bodily infirmity which is considered a disqualification for em ployment in the Ministerial Service.

Subjectprocedure for the acceptance'of applications * k •• for retirement .and resignation from offi cers appointed by the Secretary of State. Sir, I am directed to invite a reference to the Home Department letters, Nos. F.440/31-EBts. and P.116/33-E^ts., dated respectively the 28th November 1931 ana 23ra March 1933, and to forward for inforuU'oion, a copy of a letter from the India Office, No. 3.&amp; G. 3356/38, dated the 24th June 1938, on the suoject noted above. As villi be seen from that letter, t»he secretary of state proposes to make rules under section 247 of the Government of India Act, 1935, regulating the acceptance of c.pplications for retirement or resignation from officers appointed by him or by the Secre- tary of state in Council, on the lines ino-icated in para- giaph 2 thereof. The Government of India accept&gt; the pro cedure out/lined in iniat letter c^nd i am accordingly ' go suggest that, if there is no objection, it may be followed in anticipation oi the promulgation of the rules proposed to be made by the Secretary of Statu in this behalf.

IC'iii'.th, t '.C.S.- 1. ,Vith reference to the Secretcxy of state's telugr-un of the £6th M Tch 1938, No.620, on the above subject, I nm directed by the Secretary of stite to inform you th::t he h;s now considered tho- general question mich is raised in p:iragrrph 3 of your letter of the 10th March, 1938, No.35/ 12/38-ists. viz. whether or not the provincial Governments should continue to exercise the power to accept resignations of members of the All-India Services subject to the limit — tions hitherto imposed. (There seems to be a certain ambiguity in the use of 1 resignation* and •retirement' in regulations and correspondunce, and in what follows the t^rm 'retirement 1 alone is used to cover both retirom^nt or resignation from trie Service before pension has been earned , and also retirement from the Service after pension has been earn ed, including superannuation). He is disposed to think that the present position in regard to the acceptance of applications to retire from members of the ill-India Services (and also of persons appointed by the Secretary of state in Council to whom Sec tion 250 of the.Government of India Act, 1935, refers) is in need of .further clarification. As stated in your letter of the.10th March, 1938, the power to accept such applications in ill the above cases, strictly speaJcing, rests with the Secret .ry of State alone. In practice, however, it has been % found convenient th.it the Local Government should accept them subject to the following limitations: (l)in accora jice with the orders referred to in paragraph 3 of your letter, viz* those of the 7th September, 1931, ,nd the 2nd Febru .ry 1933, respectively, a previous reference must be made to the Secretary of State in any case of retirement in which the officer's-2- (3) .i offiGor's conauct-his bo^n unaor investig^ition; (2) by a provision in the Prorxiture R^tirm^nt Rules, the permission u ot 'Ohu Socrot .ry of it u is : required to retireuiuits undur those Rules; .na (3} under'the provision in Article 977(^ of the Civil'Service ReguL .tions r, member of the Indr.n Civil Service who wishes to retire from the Service while on le.we in Europe must submit his -p plication to the Secre tary of St vte. . 1 . 2. The Secret xy of St..to considers th.it the position in r^g .rd to tho .ccuptr.nce of iotirements should now be properly defined by rules ande by him under s.247 of the Government of India Act, 1935, .-nd that these rules should follow the principle that in -.ny case of termination of service of _n officer who h..,s been appointed by ohe Secre tary of State or .by the Secretary of state in Council, other than a case of.retirement falling within the follow ing three categories, viz :~ (a) retirement on or after completiton of service for ordinary pension, i \. (b) retirement; on superannuation, (c) retirement on invalid pension, except in cases ^ (vide below) where invilidment is carried out by the Meuical Bo „rd of this Office, the .pprovcal oi the Secret,.ry of state should be required to the termination of service. In the case of retirements coming within the description of (a) (b) or (c) above^^he retirement woula be'accepted by Governments in India with out reference to Lhe Secretary of State, subject to the following Lhree exceptions (1) in c .ses of retiremeiiii on or after completion of service for ordinary pension or on super:uinuation, wneio^ 'ohe officer's conduct has been under investigation or in which any special circumstance .ttaches to the retirement, the approval of the Secretary of state would be required, (2) in the case of a. member of the Indian Civil Service wjio wishes to retire while on leave in Europe, the- officer would be required, s rt present, to submit his applic i-oion to retire to the Secretary of state, and f-3- (3) in cases of retirement on ivalid pension, .liere mvalidiiient is carried out by the Medical Board of the India Office, the retirement would need to oe approved by the Secretary of state. 3. I am to enquire whether the Government of India, concur in the above mentioned principles. In the event of their concurrence 9 I am to suggest that, pending the making of the rules ? the Provincial Governments should be request ed to act in anticipation on the lines indicated in para. £ above. 4. In xhe case of Military, Indian Medical Service, and Royal Indian Navy Officers in civil employ, it is necessary to draw a distinction between retirement from the Service, which i equires to be notified in the Gazette oi India &amp;nd the ..London Gazette and is foitiially subject to His Majesty 1 s approval, and temination of civil employ ment, which may or may not be preparatory to retirement. There would appear to be no objection to applyin .. the proposed rules to cover termination of civil employment of officers oi the aoove mentioned classes, where such termi nation is preparatory to retirement.1 ■ V / // i / i /1 Res, P, G. 32.

This has led to certain anomalies and in order to remedy these, the Secretary of State has decided that officers on leave' preparatory to retirement, desiring to take up Crown employment, shall be given the option of retiring forthwith, or of remaining on leave, until they have exhausted the leave admissible to them, on condition that, so long as they are employed under the Crown, leave salary will be restricted to the amount of the pension admissible to them on retirementoif / i i \ y V ) 'A * &gt; No. 1356 - 67/18. ntish Residency and Consulate-General, Bushire, the 7th October 19 39 P.

These arrangements will apply to all persons of Military age arriving from India; including Governnsat servants returning on leave since Civil officials on leave are not covered by Section 11 of National Service Act, I suggest that lists and particulars in question should be furnished to tnt K-.gh Commissioner's Office who should be responsible for the compilation of lists and communi cation to the Ministry of Labour c Above arrangements will presumably not be applicable, except in unusual circumstances, until next leave season. As regards persons now in this country arrangements can be made for their exemption provided that the above particulars are supplied by them.

The principles outlined therein should be followed in respect of officers of the Indian Political Service and Agency burgeons. The grant of any leave must however depend upon local circumstances and developments in trie war. Officers who are employed in places distant from hill stations might find ten days casual leave inadequate, and in such cases the period might be extended to fifteen days. In the event of an officer applying for regular leave of short duration, it will not be possible to send an officer in replacement. All such applications should therefore be considered in the light of how local arrangements can be made.

New iielhi, the 14th March, 1942. My dear -^amarnurty, etc., /ill you please refer to Tettenham's very secret demi-official No;145/41-Est3., dated the 24th July 1941 on the^ subject of leave during the war. The entry of Japan ~nto the war has of course ruled out any suggestion now of short leave out of India in, for example, Australia, New Zealand or South Africa, but as the war goes on, the problem of keeping the members of the Services fit against the strain of continuous work under high pressure without the usual periods of leave becomes more acute* 2. Long leave is obviously out of the question in present conditions except on compelling medical grounds and the suggestion has been made that the rules about casual leave may be liberalised and officers encouraged and, if need be, compelled to take annual spells of such leave. It might be advisable to grp.nt district Officers who work in conditions of great strain two spells or 10 days' leave in summer and similar suitable period might be allowed to other officers also, including those in the Secretariat. Action on these lines has, it is believed, already been taken i in some provinces and may contribute to some extent to a solution of the problem, but in view of the paramount importance of officers remaining in a fit condition to bear their responsibilities it is clear that any scheme for the more generous grant of casual leave must be further supplemented by a scheme under which provision would be made ahead for the release of officers in turn during short periodsperiods of regularaeave in India, ihe objection to casual leave isj as you ai'e aware, that the officer continues to be responsible for his work when he is away and is thus not able to obtain the advantage from his holiday which a mind free from anxiety and strain alone can give. Furthermore, he is on return often faced with an accumulation of work which necessarily offsets the benefit of the holiday. i&gt;hort regular leave for, say, a month every year spent where possible in some hill s1 i a .^ i 9 n should t) e of great advantage inkeeping officers fit and efiicient during this critical period. There may be a natural reluctance among officers to take leave at present, but 1 am to suggest that it should be made generally known through services Associations or in any other suitable manner that Government consider that it is the duty or an officer to do what he can to keep himself efficient/and that an officer who runs the risk of a break-down or of becoming stale because he will not take short leave is not really helping, superior officers should see that all those who require'it take leave. 3. rhere may also be some reluctance among European officers to use up in India leave on full average pay which they wish to save for nome leave after the war. If this is so, I am to point out that the bulk of hliropean officers have novnot taken any Home leave fcr at least 3^- years and so have saved up about 4 months' leave on full average pay and it would not therefore be unreason able to aske them to spend in India the one month which they will accumulate from now on. If they had been taking Home leave in 1942, their position regarding the/amount of leave on full average pay saved up would have been the same as it will be if tkey consume hereafter one month a year in India, and it is suggested that this consideration may also be made generally known, ao long as the, amount of leave which an officer may be required to take under this proposal does not reduce the' amount on full pay which he would be able to take overseas when his turn eventually comes below the peeiod he would have been able to take' on full pay but for the postponement of leave owing to the war, there would seem to be no legitimate ground fcr the complaint that an officer is being asked to use up in India leave which he could justifiably save up to spend in the United Kingdom^ In any ca^e, any sacrifice that may be involved in this proposal must be considered as one of the unfortunate results of the war which officers should accept as a duty. 4. It is of course recognised that any scheme for the regular grant of leave must be subject in the case particularly of threatened areas to the progress of the war and its approach to India^ Yours sincere_ly, ^d/- K.Conran-fcimith.

They, therefore propose to address the secretary of State in the matter with a view to obtain a ruling whether the techMcal requirements of Section i:-40(3) will be deemed to have been complied with 1* if, when an officer is called upon to offer his defence in respect of the charges against him, he is at the sarue time asked to show cause against the penalty considered r. rl..^ facl^ to be tgwwtannr. appropriate, should the charges against him be found to be true, In the meantime, it is necessary that the ruling' already given the Secretary of State should be followed, I a^, however, to state that in the opinion of the Government of India the giving of a further opportunity to the accused officer to show cause against the penalty proposed to be imposed, should not involve the holding of a second regular enquiry. The only question to be considered at that stage would be the nature and degree of the punish ment to be inflicted, and the officer charged should, therefore, be required to confine himself strictly to this question In any explanation that he might submit.

The Government of India have consulted the Federal Public Service Commission and their tentative views on the various points raised in the India Office letters and on certain other matters connected therewith are summariaed in the annexure to this letter. These questions involve considerations of which Provincial Governments have no sjecial knovtedge and experience, and the Government of India would be glad to be favoured with the views of the Government of Madras/etc. on the various points disc ssed in the annexure« I am also to request that the views of the Provincial Government on the suggestion made in , aragraph 6 of the India Office letter may be furnished to the Government of India. Extract of paragraph 5 of the aru.exure to the above letter. 6. In making any rules it will be necessary to make certain that the procedure laid down complies with tie provisions of subsection (3) of section 240 of the Act. The sole intention of that subsection appears to have been to empody in the Act itself a provision producing: , precisely the same effect as had previously been b|F Classification Rule^56. The particular phraseolo^ employed therein has however given rise to some doubt whether, aftern an enquiry against an officer has been completed, it is not necessary formally to call upon nia to show cause against the particular penalty proposed to be imposed. The Federal I ublic Service Co?mission consider, and he Government of India agree, , that the procedure under Classification Rule 55 or under the Public Servants 1 Inquiries Act affords substantial comiliance with the spirit, if notalso with the letter, of section 240(3), and that no such action as is referred to in i&amp;e last sentance is there* after necessary. In view, however, of the doubts, felt in the matter, the Govern:: ent of India have separately asked for an authoritative ruling of the Secretary of State on the point. If it is held b|r the Secretary of State that the strict requirement ^f the section is that after an enquiry against an accused officer has been completed he should be given ax a further opportu nity of showing cause against the particular penalty proposed to be imposed, and that this effect of the section was deliberately brought about, it is considered that in that case it should be provided in the rules that at the time the officer concerned is given such an opportunity he should also be su; plied with a copy of the enquiring officers report as 9 otherwise, the protection deliberately afforded by statute would be rendreed illusory.W 2 mm/mm ^ On the other hand, If it Is held that the effect produced by section 240(3) has been so produced per .nc urlam &gt; all that vipuuld be necessary in that case to secure compliance with the provisions of the act would be to la/ down that when charges are fraaed against an officer care should be taken to see thaty in &lt;iddition to being called upon to .fler this defence! the accused is also calied upon formally to show cause against the pudshment considered ;ri^a facie to be appropriate to the case, should the charges be found true.&gt; J , (•&gt;'- 1 No. 1287-67/6.

Requirement of Section 240(3) of the Govermaent of India Act, 1935, rw' 1 am directed to say that the Federal Court have recently held, in the course of a judgment in appeal in a suit filed by an officer against his removal from service, that the provisions of sub-section (3) of section 240 of the Government of India Act, 1935 are mandatory and contemplate that, after the enquiry against an accused officer has been completed, he should be givena further opportunity of showing cause against the particular penalty proposed to be inflicted when such penalty is dismissal, removal or reduction in rank.

Government of India, Home Department. New Delhi, the 26th OFPICE MEMORANDUM October, 1945 # Subject i Discontinuance of reservation of Central Government posts for 'war service 1 candidates - future policy. Home Department's Office Memorandum No. 70/63/46- Ests. (R), dated the 14th September, 1945, and replies of Departments. The Governor General in Council has decided that the policy of reserving permanent vacancies in the Central Services for 'war service 1 candidates should cease at the end 4f 1946 and that, in regard to permanent vacancies arising thereafter, the policy explained below should be adopted until further orders t - 1. fpo- ! 2. 3. The object of the policy of reservation was to encourage recruitment to the Forces by preserving for men who Joined the Forces the normal opportunities of securing a post in the civil service. The consequential suspen sion of the normal recruitment needs of the civil Government was Justified by the over-riding needs of war, but with the cessation of hostilities it is considered that normal recruitment should be resumed as early as practicable. The policy df reserving vacancies will therefore be discontinued from the end of 1946. There will be no reservation of post-1945 vacancies for •war service* candidates. But such candidates will as far as practicable, be enabled to compete with civilian candidates on equal terms. To implement this policy it is necessary to distinguish between (a) Superior Services (excluding ministerial services) and (b) ministerial subordinate and inferior Services. In the case of the Superior Services (excluding ministerial services) the War Department have agreed to enable Service candidates to compete while still serving with the Forces. Such candidates will therefore compete with civilian candidates within the normal age-limits and will not be allowed to deduct 'war service' from, their age for this purpose; this concession is applicable only in respect of 'war reserved' vacancies in the Superior Services. In the case of the Ministerial subordinate and inferior services, candidates in the Forces will not be able to compete until they have been demobilised and will therefore be given the age concession i.e . will be allowed to deduct their service in the Forces from their age for the purpose of maximum age limit. The principle of selection in the case of 'war reserved' vacancies is designed to ensure that the chances of those serving in operational areas are not prejudiced vla-a-vis those who have been serving else where. Similarly, the principle of selection for unreserved post-1946 vacancies must be such that candidates from the Forces are not prejudiced vis-a-vis civilian candidates. To satisfy the principle in the ... case of2 I3&gt; case of 'war reserved 1 vacancies it has been decided that a written competitive examination should be avoided and that, for the Superior Services, selection should be made by means of selection boards followed by interview. Written competitive examination should similarly be avoided as far as practicable in selecting for unreserved post-1945 vacancies in all services. In the case of recruitment of technical and ministerial personnel, however, there is no objection to a practical examination as opposed to one of sin academic nature. In the case of those services which are recruited through the Federal Public Service Commission the Department concerned will decide upon the application of this principle to the method of recruitment in consultation with the Commission. 4. •War Service* candidates will not be eligible for the technical services unless they are technically qualified, but in the case of technicians who have received the whole or part of their training in the services it is the duty of the Department concerned to decide how far the standard demanded of, or in practice attained by, the technicians in the Forces is adequate for civil requirements. It may then be possible to lay down technical qualifications for those 'war service 1 candidates who do not possess the technical qualifications normally required before the war. -Any educational concession granted to ^ar service 1 candidates in respect of 'war reserved 1 vacancies will also be allowed in respect of post-1945 vacancies to war service candidates and to any candidate from the Forces who may not have rendered actual war service. 5. Temporary Government servants in ministerial, subordinate and inferior services will be allowed to compete for post-1945 vacancies in those services together with other civilian candidates and candidates from the Forces. Such temporary Government servants will be allowed to deduct their continuous temporary service from their age for the purpose of the maximum . age limit.

Subject:- Lifting of war-time restrictions on travellers ex-India in the matter of pre-censorship, security and export regulations. &gt; * • 1 Sir, I am directed to say that consequent on tjhe cessation of hostilities anc the relaxation to a certain extent of the restrictions on travellers ex-India, it has bedome necessary to clarify the position for the benefit of Key Leave officials. So far as travellers' censorsni and security regulations are concerned, all reference to these subjects may in future be omitted from the instructions issued to officers proceeding - on key leave. Please see in this connexion War Department (Army Branch) letter NorF .16/45 /W -l, dated the 1st November 1945. As regards export regulations by which kdy leave officers were also effected, instructions have since bean issued bv the Defence Department vide, their letter To.40/411/pass, dated the 4th October 1945 addressed to the Government of the Central Provinces and copy endorsed to all the other provincial Governments. 2. As regards other general instructions in regard to travel ex-j.ndia, there are no material changes. The following may however be brought to the notice of the'key leave officers:- 1. Passports . All persons proceeding ex-India should ha^e passports duly endorsed. 2. Vaccination. Although vaccination and inoculation against cholera are no longer compulsory passengers are strongly advised in their own interests to have these done. S. Ba ; ?:p:ag;e Limit. Key leave officials should be advised to consult their shipping agents regarding baggage allowances, 4. Passage rates. Key leave officials are litble to be embarked in commercial steamers as well as hired transports. At present there is a flat rate of ^ 6S/- for passage: by transport while the rates by commercial steamer vary from £ 70/- to £ 90/-. Passage'rates can be obtained on application to shipping agents. 5« Payvients of passa e fare . H^me Department letters No. 229/3/4c-Ests, dated the 14th April and 22nd August 1944 will be partially modified to the extent thfet Key Leave officials should pay t^e cost of their passage through their shipping agents, whether they travel by ' / I (p^?)11' -2- hlred transports or commercial steamers and irrespective of whether they pay through their Lee Commission Account or their private account Temporary accommodation in Bombay .
