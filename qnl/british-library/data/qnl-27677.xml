Saif bin Humaxd al buiiri, a close friend of Jhaiidi Isa bin iialeh al Haritha, who was on his way-to Bahrain tc get some parts for a pumping machine,- called on me. The object of his visit was apparently to sound me on the subject of a renewal 01 the Fuscat - Cmani Treaty made in September 1920 through the mediation of Hr. tfingate. Political A^ent at i.yuscat at that time. (See rr. wingate's despatch Ko.2052 of 14th October 1920)• 2* There is evidently some anxiety in Omani circles as to whether the new oultan will rene'a the tieaty# Tiie Shaiich said tiiat opinion in the interior held that r is T i^hness was too youn^; for his important position, and that he v/as inclined to be 'rash*. I replied that I iaiew the Sultan well r much better I ventured to surest than did the people of Oman, that he had an uncommonly old and shrewd head on youn^, shoulders, and was by no means raslu Vith regard to the renewal of the Treaty, the Sultan would be back from --'hoiar some time alter the middle of April when Shaildi Isa could take up the matter with him. ^ • -C -i i e Omanis, v.'ith the example of Sur be lorethem, are apparently unaer the impression that His I:i 0 hness may endeavour, jjerha^s with our assistance, to regain seme of the old Kuscat control over the interior, which, misapprehension is no bad thin fo as it vail majce them ea^jer to conclude the confirmation of the Treaty, and to make the lirst advances. Before leaving for Dhofar in fact the oultan spoke to me about this very matter, and said that he had intended to write to Shaikh Isa on the subject, but that on further reflection had decided to let the latter make the first step. I said that I thought this a wise m«ve. In Arab politics it is often a case of rien faire c f est a^jir . There should not be any difficulty about the actual renewal therefore as both parties desire it. The Omanis, since the Treaty was made hy the mediation of His Majesty's G-overniuent as represented by Mr, win^ate, will probably require some assurance that His I'aJ t sty* s Government approve of the renewal. If I were u iven trie necessary authority^ a letter from me to the sultan saying that His Majesty*8 Government approved of the renewal, which letter His Highness could show to shaikh Isa, would probably meet the case^ 4. Shaikh Saif also asked me if the late Sultan had abdicated of his own free will, or whether he had been pressed to do so by Government. I explained to him at some length that far from pressing him to abdicate Government, the present Sultan, you and myself had all taken infinite pains to try and persuade Sir Taimur bin ITaisal to remain on as ^ultan, both by letters and personal interviews, but in vain. That the late sultan was a pleasant individual, and a friend of mine, but that frankly he was not fond of work and much preferred travelling about India, Ceylon and Burma to performing; his duties at Muscat. 5. Shai^da Saif is a nice old gentleman, and aft I wished him to carry back sympathetic impressions ofthe Agency to the interior I gitve him a cordial reception and a note for the Bahrain Agency aakin^ them to let him have their ^ood offices should he require them. * Lieut#Colonel, Political Afeent &amp; E.B.HU Consul, Muscat.a IH mail.

I do not quite hewerer see the point of your state ment that the Oaanis will probably require sone assurance tnat His Majesty^ GeYernment ap^rore of the renewal, since the treaty was made by the mediation ol their representative. It seems to me that if the Omanis were reluctant to renew the treaty it miiiht then ce desirable to inform them tiiat the British Goyernaent aesired its renewal and were prepared to support the State in the eyent of their refusing to renew it. As, howeyer, the Qaanis themselyes are apparently desirous ef renewing the treaty, I see no necessity for informing them ef the fact that the British authorities desire its renewal. On the ether hand this is a matter in whieh Hi® Highness the Sultan should, I think, be guided by our adviee, and were he if en his side reluetant to renew the treaty I think it wouli ce desirable ...desirable te intliakte to him that we defcired it te be renewed* Ae, however, he apparently is equally desireue of reneivin^ it, adriee on our part would eeern to be superfluous• In fact, einee both parties desire the renewal, it seems to me a matter in which we can stand aloof exeept to the extent of bringing the parties together, and this I suggest might be done by ^ettin^ hold of Shaikh Saif on his return and suggesting te him that Shaikh Isa bin Saleh should approaeh the Sultan in the matter* This apparently yeu hare done during your last interriew, but if you get another opportunity you might perhaps further emphasise the matter te him.

The Hon'tle the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Eushire. Subject: - lluscst -Omani Treaty^ Memorcndum. please refer to your memorandum ITo.245-S of 25th April, paragraph 3. The point of my statement was to prepare in advance for a contingency which is likely to arise. Arabs are conservative creatures and as the local representative of Government mediated last time they will probably want him to take some part in the Treaty this time also. Moreover the Cmanis, who are nervous - quite without cause of course - as to the Sultan's intentions towards them will probably feel safer if we countenance the Treaty in some way. If they do make some such request then it will be an advantage to have considered the situation beforehand. If they don't then T c ^uite agree we should stand aloof. Should, however, they ask from us for &amp;Dme sort of recognition of the Treaty^then the suggestion at the end of para 3 of my letter ZTo.79 of 4th April would seem to represent the minimum of interference on our parV and may satisfy the Ononis.

With reference to your letter dated the 28th Jamadi I, 1351 complaining regarding an extra tax which you state is being le^.ed by the Muscat State. I do not understand exactly what you ...ean by an extra tax. 71111 you please explain what the nature of this ixx extra tax is, when it was first started, on what articles it is taken ind if it is more than the 5 $ agreed upon in the treaty. U. E. Translation of a letter dated the 11th *amadi II, 1351 (loth October 1932) from Sheikh Isa bin Salih to Captain R.G. Alban, Political Agent £ Consul, Muscat. A.C. After my departure from Hustaq I received your letter while I was on the way. I am todayjc at I.'uawil and intend to proceed to Semail. I understood what you have mentioned in your letter. As to .your enquiry about the nature of this extra tax and when it was started. This extra tax was started shortly before the succession ol Saiyid Said to the Hultanate and as far as I know it was collected on the loads of dry dates that is -J of a dollar up oo 1- was first collected on each load and then it is was increased* As there was no damand for dry dates last year the cost of each^pf dry dates was hardly covering its hire andm Customs dues and perhaps the owner was to pay something over it. T wrote to the T7ali of Sur who represented the matter to the Muscat Government. I also addressed a letter to the Council but did not receive any answer as the Council was atolished owing to the succesion of the new Sultan to the Sultanate of Muscat. I deemed it necessary to report the matter to you. If the collector of Customs was taking 5 loads on every 100 lads instead of 5 it was alright, but he has recovered trxes as T have explained. I shall be grateful if you will write a letter to the Customs official directing him to take taxes according to the agreement which was concluded through the Btitish Government, and send that letter with my messenger so that I may send it to Sur. U. E. Copy of a D.C.letter dated 19th October 1932 from Captain t^.g. Alban, Political A^ent &amp; Consul, Kuscat, to H.H. Saiyid Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat £ Oman. T have received another long letter from Sheikh Isa bin Salih with regard to the Customs tax on the Bisr dates brought dov/n into Sur from Oman. In order to enable me to see whether he has any ground for complaint or not may I request Your Highness to kindly furnish me with some details as to the tax actually collected in these days at Sur by Your Highness's Customs. The details required are (a) price of Bisr dates per bahar at Sur (b) number of lords in one bnhar and (c) amount of tax taken by Customs on each load coming from Oman into Sur. I shall be grateful for this information. Translation of a letter dated the 18th Jamadi ii, 1351 (20th October 1932) from H.H. Saiyid Said bin Tsimur, Sultan of Luscat Oman, to Captain R.G. Alban, Political Agent ^ H.B.K's Consul, Muscat. A.C. i have received your letter dated the 19th October and understood its contents. The answer is (a) the present price of)!» of each bahar of Bier dctes at Sur is ^ 160/200, ('b) the bahar consists of 6 Band loads and the weight of each ba^ is between 1-6 to 18 Muscat maunds* Two bags makes one camel load and (c) the amount of customs duty on each load is 1-f, I may add that the price of Bisr changes and depends upon the market rate. Its highest price was $ 230 and the lowest was ^ 175/-. If the present price of each bahar is &amp; 160 the cost of each camel load would be $ 30 and the Customs duty on each load is £ l-J. Tn this connection I forward herewith a copy of a letter Ho.1/8/47 dated the 16th ^arch 1932 addressed to me by my late Financial Adviser. U. E. Letter Ko.1/8/47 dated the 16th Harch 1932 from the Financial Adviser to H.H.the Sultan of Muscat. A. G. Reference Sheikh Isa bin Salihjs communication with regard to Bisr tax at 3ur I have the honour to state as follows:- The price of each bahar of Bisr was fixed in 1930 at &amp; 210 and the bahar consists of 7 camel loads. The cost of each camel load is 30 and its Customs duty was fixed at ^ 1-J- by the agreement of all the merchants at Sur. The Bisr dates which are imported into Sur are those which are valued at ^ 250 per bahar at the beginning of the season, but it is regretted that the &lt;ru.&gt; c—^ price has recently gone down^to the disturbance in India. The Customs director, Iskandar, who will be ^oing to 3ur at the be^innin^ of the next season will fix up accorc^in^ to the circumstances the Customs duty on each bahar of Bisr with the merchants without ctusin^ any loss to the Government or the merchants. As to Sheikh Isa*6 statements with regard to the irregular actions tsken by the brokers at L'atrah, I have not heard about^Jbefore the receipt of Sheikh Isa^s letter.lb Copy of a letter Ho. 10 ^ dated the 28th October 1932 from Captain R.G. Alban, Political A^ent £c H.B.K's Consul, Kuscat, to Sheikh Iso 'bin Salih al Harithi. A. C. I have to thank you for your letter dated the 11th Jamadi I, 1351 (13th October 1932) supplying the details regarding your complaint about an extra tax collected on dates coming into 3ur. T have addressed the Muscat State asking for certain information with regard to this tax and I am now in a position to reply to your abovementioned letter# The Customs tax on Bisr dates entering Sur from Oman is collected by a Customs clerk who lives in the Wali's fort at Balad Sur. The tax is no new one but has been collected ever since Sur was brought under Customs administration. The present price of a bahar of Bisr dates in Sur is 0 180 to $ 200, the bahar norroally consists of 6 camel loads of two ba^s each. The amount of Customs duty collected on each camel load is 0 1-J, that is to say^ 0 9 per bahar. You will thus see that if the present price of Bisr dates at Sur is 0 180 per bahar- then the Customs duty of ^ 9 represents exactly b If the price is 0 200 then the present Customs duty taken would boly represents % 4J According to the treaty of Sib the State has the right to take up to 5 f? duty^ and it is therefore clear that no contravention of the said treaty has taken place at Syr, -he Bisr dates which are brought into Sur are the highest valued dates in the country £nd before the present trade depression the value was round about 0 250/-. You will therefore see that if the present trade revival continues Omani merchants will be paying less than the 5 % allowed by the treaty of Sib. You have said in your letters that the treaty of Sib has been contravened in this matter and I would be glad if in future before making such statements you will be careful to ascertain the correct facts of the case. I have already sent you two replies to your previous letters as well as addressed the I'uscat State authorities several times both verbally and in wr ting and it is not understood why youn hove written to the Political Resident at Bushire stating that no replies had 'been received from this office, U.

The Sheikh has u^til now merely addressed evasive replies to the Sultan, who informs me that on your recent tour here he submitted the case to you for your advice as to th« course of action to be adooted. TT is Highness has again represented the matter to me and is anxious to know your decision to enable him to take early action# The gist of the Sultan 's conversation ,*ith me is as x 0.1.10'W S I - (i) Is the British Government ^oinj to keep the -eace be tween the parties? ( i.e. presumably enforce the agree ment } i (ii) Tf not then His T Ii i ,hness wishes to be free to take such action as he thinks fit without interference on our ?fcrt; (iii) If such action involves lots to a British subject he cannot hold himself responsible*Should you conssider it desirable to intervene then I cm of the opinion that a stern letter should issue to Sheikh Is a 'bin Salih from either yourself or the Political Agent re minding him of the treaty ohligctions. 5. Should this 'be ineffective the re-imposition of a ^snal Zakat against the 01 lenders could 'be resorted to» lleantime the handing over of any refugees from the Cmani Sheikhs would lapse. 6. His Highness is of the opinion that the imposition of the Zakat would certainly lead to trouble and raiding in the Batinah, and he a^^ears to regard any such idea with trepidation. 7# Tn Wingate's time the lluscat Infantry had not been estab lished but the &gt;ire£;ence of troops jrobably had a sobering effect on w'le truculent Cmanis. /our luller ex ^.er ience of local matters would enable you to decide whether the present force of Tuscat Infantry would be sufficient to deal alone with any trouble that might arise by Omanis raiding the Batinah, or other repercussions that might occur from the re-imposition of a ^enal zakat. S. His Highness cannot at present indicate to me what line he would ado^t should he be given a free hand. It is obvious that he cannot be permitted to refute all responsibility should a British subject be involved through destruction of property or loss of life, but should the individual's trade be affected then it should be merely regarded as ' the fortune of war 11 for which no responsibility attaches. I think it unlikely however that the Cmanis would deliberately harm any British subject for fear of the consequenee s. I would be grateful if you would communicate your views on the subject to me at your earliest convenience to permit of His Highness formulating his proposals. He is most anxious that the matter sh.oula not hang lire any longer, the .^eby enco raging the Cmanis to the detriment of his own authority. A Tajor.

Cn the abdication of the late Sultan of Muscat and the accession of the present one last January, the latter was of the opinion that the above Treaty, originally made between the late Sultan and the Omani Shaikhs, would need reuewel, and some correspondence passed on the sub, eot between myself - as political Agent, Muscat - and the late Sir Hugh Biscoe. Both parties apparently desired a renwwal and it was finally decided that we sh o uld • • • • 8.* DC V V - —(G-1254)—24-^-31—1,00.000.■-2- anould stand aloof and let things take their course. 3, Uo actual steps have been taken towards a renewal, but both parties, the present Sultan and the Oioani Uhaikh^ headed by Shaikh Isa bin Saleh, apparently regard the Treaty as still binding on them. 4 # A n incident has occurred of the murder of a Muscat State employee, in Muscat territory, the murderers being alleged by the Muscat State - on the evidence of local trackers etc. - to belong to an Omani village. -he Sultan h^a addressed Shaikh Isa to hand over the murderers in accordance with the Agreement of 1920 effected by Mr. Wingate, but the Siieikh returns evasive replies, I hike does not contend that the Treaty no longer exists^which confirms my impression (para graph 3 above) that he regards it as still hrving force.) 5.

Before replying to him, however, I would be grateful for a confirmation by telegram that the Government of India concur in my views of our responsibility as to the Treaty,i.e. that Mr.Wingate was merely a mediator between the Sultan and the Omanis, and that the Government of India therefore have no responsibility in enforcing it on either party, though of . ,, • •-4- of course they are prepared to give their '^o d officea', as far as the efforts of their officials in the Gulf are concerned, in keeping the peace between the parties.

The case of the Sib murder has already been sub mitted to you with His Hi^nness •the Sultan's representations thereon and a re^ly is awaited as to the course of action to be adopted. In the meanwhile I am verbally informed by Hi* Highness that a further attempted murder has ta.-cen ^iace at Sib, which he attributes entirely to de ^ay and lack of action in Lhe first instance; The constant addressing of frivolous letters of the type enclosed to the political A^ent, Muscat, by SheiJdi Isa is a growing annoyance, particularly when coupled with Isa* s own evasive line of action with the Sultan over the above quoted Sib case# I would be grateful, in the event of i.y present reply meeting with your approval, tc - eceive te^efcra^hic intimation of the same to avoid further aelay.

The re^ly is not satisfactory because the (British) Government had arranged Uiat a tax of 5 dollars should be coxlected in «.il ^orts on a xJO dollars and not on loads. There is nothing special about importation of Oi.ja.ni ^oods at 3ur and other places. This tax lias ,recently been ^evied b^ the Customs Official at iiur and I nave already iuiormed you when it was started. You ha.e pointed out t^at ^ 1% are collected on each load. That means that they have collected more than what was arranged because the number of loads in each Bahar defends upon the strength and weakness of camels, sometimes tiiere are 6 and sometimes 7 or 8 loads in a Bahar. As to the Bisr aates some of them are of no va^ue sur.d some of them are sold atl loss. The best Bisr u&amp;tes were sold this yt ar at ^ 16J x .er Baliar and the inferior quality did not fetch any value. If this is the condition it is not un lerstood why the tax is collected on loaas. I await your favourable reply as the matter has been going on for some time. Secondly the V/alis of the Sultan are oppressing the people { of Oman) without any cauae. One of the T/alis is Saiyid Hamad, ¥feli of Iiatrah, to v .hom I wrote as I did not bant to bother you but he did not jend me an answer. It is laid do.«n in the Treaty that none ( of Ci^an subjects) should undergo any penalty unless • his case is roved before the Shara.

You also allege in your letter that the T /ali of Matrah i»3 oppressing Omanis, you do not stale in what 'way or quote any dexinite case* You refer a^ain to the treaty and im A jly tljat it has been breached* In this connection I may invxte your attention to the fact that the murderers of two of His Eignness»s subjects at Sib in September last were definitely tracked to IQiaudh.

Last Wednesday T had a visit from Sheikh I'uhaminad bin Isa, elder son of Sheikh Isa bin Salih al Marithi, Sheikh of Oman. He brought with him a letter from his father addressed to me saying that his son would discuss with me the question of the alleged unfair Customs duty at Sur on Cmcni dates coming from the interior. 3. reply to Sheikh Isa on this question (vide my memo.Ho.1214 dated 1st November 1932) 7/as unsatisfactory and he asked what we intended to do towards setting this matter right according to the Treaty of Sib 'between Muscat and Oman. 4.

I told him to inform his father of the foregoing conversation and to tell him that it is not the least use coming to the Political Agent with such complaints v/hen no attempt has been made to render co-operation to the State in such matters, lor example, as the bib murders.

Bremner, M.C., Political Agent dc H.B.l/Ps Consul, Muscat* The ^on'ble the Political Resident in the Persian ^ulf, Bushire. Subject:- Qmani Affairs. Sir, fff^DtNCY l&amp;v'/ Hit '.h/W OOKWtMIAl W601W8 I have the honour to report that on- 19th ultimo Sheikh Mohanimad bin Isa bin Salih el Harithi, deputed by his father, paid a visit to Muscat, where he was the guest of lis Highness the Sultan. 2. The ostensible object of the visit was to settle certain outstanding cases between Muscat and Mman, (in cluding the case of the Sib murder reported in my letter No.210 dated 20th December 1932), and to make representa tions regarding the alleged excessive import duties collected at Sur by the Muscat authorities. 3. Since the Sib murder of 1932 certain other murders have apparently taken place in Oman, the murderers taking refuge in Muscat territory. As the responsible Qmani authorities had adopted an evasive and unsatisfactory attitude with regard to the Muscat representations, so the Muscat Government have hitherto declined to take action on Omani claims. The latter being in a preponderance the shoe has now begun to pinch the Omani corn, and hence the pre sent deputation. 4. Sheikh Mohammad presented his cases with consum mate and tortuous skill, but the ripostes of His Highness in each case proved too much for him. Having lost the first round, he endeavoured to dig J li Ifu ^ up cases dating back in some instances fifteen years• The Sultan however flatly declined to entertain any such claims stating that they should have been presented at the time by the responsible Sheikhs, and that the only case of which he was prepared to take cognizance were those that had occurred in his own reign. 5« Sheikh Mohammad then referred to the alleged grievan ces of Qmanis arising out of excessive collections at Sur on imported Qmani produce* His Highness on examination of his records found that recoveries had in fact been collected in excess of the 5% stipulated in the Treaty. Whilst informing Sheikh Mohammad 'that in view of the fall in prices and out of personal regard for him, he had issued orders for a tem porary reduction of the amounts to be collected', His High ness has issued instructions to rectify the mistake. 6. It is somewhat amusing to note that in his letter of greeting to the Sultan, Sheikh Isa stated that he was sending his son to deal direct with His Highness on certain matters 'as we do not want any intermediary between us' ? (the intermediary being the British). Inspite of this fact Sheikh Mohammad was also armed with a polite letter from his father to me asking me to arbitrate in any matters that his son might not be able to get settled I ' This letter Sheikh Mohammad presented to me when he eventually decided to call at the Agency on his last day in Muscat. 7. The main point of interest however would appear to lie in the fact that the Omani continues to regard the treaty as binding and unaffected in anyway by a change of Rulers in Muscat. Sheikh Mohammad, in his conversations with the Sultan, continually referred to the 'present existing treaty'. In face of this it would be untenable, if at any future date the Omani pleads the lapse of the treaty due to a change of Rulers in Muscat. 8. Finally I would state that throughout Sheikh Mohammad's visit. His highness the Sultan most punctilliously kept me informed of the trend of the conversations and, in the guiseof seeking my advice, readily told me of his proposed line of action in each case.

The situation in 1937 was generally as follows The Sultan was in Dhofar where he had 'been since October 12th, 1935 ana seemed likely to remain for an in definite time. Saiyid Shahah, an uncle of the Sultan was nominally in charge of affairs in Muscat. He was a pleasant, ineffective, man not fond of making decisions. Rai Sahib Duli Chand was Director of Revenues. The finances of the State were fair. The budget was being balanced at least on paper, but there was nothing to spare to carry out sanitary and public health projects which were long overdue. The Batinah was quiet and the local Governors giving little or no trouble. The province of Dhofar was under the immediate control of the Sultan. The coastal area between Muscat and Sur not more than usually unruly. In the interior the Imam was at his headquarters at Nizwah and was in a strong politi cal position. He was supported by the two powerful Shaikhs Isa bin Salih of the Sharqiyeh and Suleman bin Hamyar of Jabl Akhdar. These Shaikhs were absolutely independent of the Sultan and like the Imam had no connection with the Sultan's administration. They controlled the interior of Oman proper. They paid 'Zakat' to the Imam and submitted their major problems to him. iie having power of life and I****. * death. Ordinary tribal troubles were settled by these Shaikhs themselves without reference to anyone. The Sultan not only had no say in affairs in the areas controlled by these men but he had no contact with them and their territory was a forbidden land to him and his servants. To the west of w . ^ ^ _ Jabl Akhdar in the neighbourhood of and to the south of Baraimi oasis the tribal leaders were virtually independent They owed no allegience to the Imam and though theoritiQally |«i1 i *1 ri.aim a*,,**.:. , i'm ' ' - subordinate to the Sultan had no practical contact with him and it is doubtful whether they would have paid the slightest attentionattention to requests sent to thera by him. The principal Shaikhs in this area were the leaders of the a1 B u Shamis and the Nairn tribe. They showed an inclination to take the advice of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi rather than that of the Sultan. RECENT EVENTS . On 15th February 1937 the Sultan returned to Muscat after an absence of sixteen months. He entered into negotia tion with Petroleum Concessions Limited for the Muscat and Dhofar concession. Agreement was eventually reached on 24th June 1937. Towards the end of the same year the Sultan was visited by Shaikh Isa bin Salih the paramount Shaikh of the Sharqiyah, He remained in Muscat for six days and was the Sultan's guest. The visit was an expensive one as far as His Highness was concerned and it was reported on good autho rity that Shaikh Isa was given a substantial present on leaving. Shaikh Isa had never been the Sultan's guest before and had not visited Muscat for many years. Developments were interrupted by the Sultan's .vorld tour in the winter of 1937-38. He returned to Muscat on 13th July 1938 and since that date events have moved rapidly. Im- portant and unimportant tribal leaders from the interior have visited him in Muscat and a list of these visitors is given as an annexure to this report. Some of these visitors deserve an individual mention. Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah al Hamudah is the on paramount Shaikh of the Bani Bu Ali. He had hs more than one occasion proved himself a nuisence to the Muscat Government. His tribal area lies inland from Sur and for years has been forbidden ground to the Ruler of Muscat and Oman. He accepted a handsome present and a monthly stipend from the Sultan and as far as security is concerned the Sultan is prepared to accept responsibility for survey parties of Petroleum Concessions Limited entering the greater part of this Shaikh's tribal territory- 3 - . ^ territory. Shaikh i /iohajiimad bin liarith of the Bani Battash rules the area behind ^uryat ana has not been on good terms with the Sultan and has not visited Muscat, He has now been in for a visit and departed a richer man. Shaikh Ahmad bin x^oharamad the Shaikh of the Zara is doubly important in that in addition to being an influential man he is also the son in law of the Imam, Shaikh Llohaaimad bin Isa is the son of Shaikh Isa bin Salih, He was on his way to Zanzibar and while waiting in Muscat for a steamer stayed with His Highness as his guest. The last and by no means the least important of the visitors are the paramount Shaikhs of the Naim and the A1 Bu Shamis who arrived here on the 7th siimK of this month and affirmed their allegience to the Sultan, His Highness in his capacity as their overlord arranged a truce between them for one year. They had been at faud for sometime past. His Highness received a messenger from Shaikh Sulemain bin Hamyar of Jabl Akhdar on the 18th of June and accepted a horse which has been sent to him as a gift by that Shaikh, In addition to the quite imposing list of the visitors there have been some significant appointnents, The Sultan has appointed Shaikh Suleman Baruni as his adviser on 'Internal Affairs' and he is at present in Muscat, Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah who is the brother of the Imam has been appointed Wali of Boshar and His Highness was pleased to honour his sif'ali by driving to Boshar on 5th May 1939 and dining with him. The late ^adhi of Rastuq Shaikh Nasr bin Rashid al Kharusi, who is a brother of the late Imam was appointed ^adhi of Suwaiq by the Sultan on 12th May 1939, This individual is a man of very strict religous views and is reported to command a considerable following among the 'Ulema' who are responsible for the election of the Imam, That the Sultan is not neglecting the religous leaders is clear and that he is in touch with other influential members of the 'Ulema' is certain. The Sultan has elected to spend his summer in Muscat this yearthis year and not go to Dhofar which is very dear to him. He has moved to the small village of Cantab situated within six miles of the capital, and visits his office at Muscat two or three times a week, travelling from Qantab by motor boat. Rai Sahib Duli Chand has been dismissed but his place as a favourite has been ta-.en by the pro-Arab Palestinian School Master Ismail bin Khalil Rassasi, who recently has been appointed *./ali of Mat rah. This individual does not see eye to eye with Shaikh Suleman Baruni who is a man of more intelli gence. The Imam has been finding his finances rather difficult to manage and it is known that some of the Shaikhs have ceased to be regular in their payment of 'Zakat'. He has been forced to sell some of his property to meet his commit ments. Recently he was rexported on very good authority to have held a meeting at Nizwah to consider the situation. He was alarmed at the number of his followers who were finding Muscat interesting. He intended issuing an order that Muscat was out of bound and that Shaikhs were forbidden to visit the Sultan. On the advice of Shaikh Isa bin Salih the order was not issued or if it was was cancelled. Shaikh Isa is said to have contended that the order would not be obeyed and an attempt to enforce it would only lead to bloodshed which was undesirable. The meeting was inconclusive. CONCLUSIONS . The known facts only have been stated and it is because doubtful information has been excluded that the events from 1937 to the present day cannot be given as coherent story but must be set out as an apprently disconnected series of are incidents. There are so many straws that there/enough of them to show fairly clearly the direction of events. ..hether the wina will blow steadily ami whether it is an unc ertainuncertain affair that may die|f away at any moment is like all atmospheric forcasts largely a matter of guessing. A record of events is a matter of fact 'but the deductions to be made from them must necessarily be personal and merely an expression of views. From the events that I have recorded I draw the following conclusion;- In 1937 the Sultan, who is not of a warlike disposition though a man of considerable personal courage, saw little chance of regaining control of the whole of Muscat and Omanjby . the only alternative methods to fighting and that was by buying the alle- gience of the Shaikhs and so undermining the Iman^s influence. His financial resources would not permit of any extra expenditure. Even if he had succeeded in regaining control v/ithout money for development the interior offered little but trouble, therefore he decided to leave affairs in Muscat in the hands of Kai Sahib Duli Chand who might be a man of doubtful honesty but was a eaea capable revenue official who produced sufficient money for the Sultan and the State's immediate requirements. He knew that the presence of our landing grounds along the coast would make it essential that peace be maintained from south of Kalba to Kishen, that if there was trouble in these areas and he took no action the probabilities were that we would settle the matter for him. The most pleasant place ± fl to live in his country, that was accessible to him, was Dhofar. Climatically it is pleasant and is green. The tribes were quiet and he liked them personally. Very well he would retire to Dhofar in much the same way as his father had retired to Japan. There without worries he would lead a quiet and pleasant life. The interest that commercial under takings evinced in the possibility of oil in Arabia after the success of the Bahrain field offered a means of obtaining more money. He returned to Muscat in February 1937 and the negotia tions were completed in June 1937 and the money was a fact. The immediate- 6 - ro The im lediate result of the possession of ample funds was the decision to make a world tour. The world cruise probably brought before the Sultan a true realisation of his position. He was a ruler in name and little else. The part he did rule, he ruled only because the British Government seemed to be prepared to maintain the status quo in Muscat for their own purposes and would probably help him to put down any rising against his au thority. whether or not His Majesty's Government would have been prepared to aid him is a question that does not concern this appreciation. The tribes believe we would and so they still believe which is important. Being a young man, he is twentynine, he naturally wished to manage his own affairs. Then again and very important the money he had received would not last for ever and the yearly payments he was to receive from the Oil Company were limited andSnight terminate somewhat abruptly. If he was to be financially secure the company must find oil and they could not do that without exploring the concession area. Unfortunately the most hopeful areas lay outside his control. In order to ., 1 , ■« i 'i ii _ ^ 'ttomu ' i ' •' v allow the company access to these areas he mu^t either come to some monetary arrangement with the Imam which was distasteful to him or else the tribal Shaikhs must be weaned from their allegience to the Imam. The latter course he preferred. It would certainly be cheaper in the long run and if he was sucess- ful then he would be in fact as well as in name Sultan of Muscat and Oman. As soon as he returned to Muscat he started to make his plans. The tribal Shaikhs have been invited to Muscat and bribed. Some of the Imam's relatives have been induced to leave him. The 'Jlema' are doubtful of their position and are in clining more and more to Muscat. This attack on those surround ing the Imam and on those on whom he depends for support has already resulted in a great increase in the Sultan's influence in the interior and a corresponding decrease in the Imam's power. The Imam being financially embarrassed has been unable to meet ' ■»- 7 - iTl to meet the attack. The Sultan hopes that the Imam will be forced to abdicate and that his influence will be so great that . i■.w t I,, i - -t -.--r-i r^in ii»iiiniiB'iiw&gt;&lt;iii'ii&lt;wiMn»ii r i&lt; i i ni' ■i'fnuigi ri iirin»itriri ' jv.. r *- ywr'».• .*&lt;• he will be elected as the next Imam - thus once again combining Imamate with the Sultanate. The attack will be maintained until the financial ammunition fails or until the Imam has abdicated. Should the ammunition fail before the attack has been successful the Sultan will retire to Dhofar and resume his old life. He may even ask for his country to be taken under the protection of the British Government like Zanzibar. That he has recovered much lost ground is certain and opinions regarding his influence must be revised. Should he be successful in his undertaking I fear he may find that retaining his gains ^a more difficult task than he expects. He is young and with sage councillors may display the strength of character and soundness of judgment necessary for the task. Recently his choice of advisers has not been very happy.!• 1 find that Sheiich Isa has not been in since 1937 (winter) • 2.

Hickinbotham, 0«B«£*, Political Agent &amp; H.B.M's Consul, Muscat* # The Hon'ble the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* Sir, I hare the honour to inform you that His Highness the Sultan has acquainted me with facts which have lead to a deterioration in the peaceful situation in the Dahirah and the action he has already taken to restore the situation together with his future intentions* 2. General , A geographical and topographical description of the Dahirah is given at page 427 Volume 2 of Lorimer 1 s Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf* The area is inhabited by semi-independent tribes who acknowledge the Sultan of Muscat and Oman as their overlord when it suits their convenience to do so but who usually consider them selves their own masters* During the last two or three years partly in furtherance of his plan to establish effective control over the whole of his country and partly because this is the area in which Petroleum Concessions Limited, who hold an oil concession for the country, have been most interested, the present Sultan has made a sustained effort to increase his political control in the area* That the Sultan's efforts have been successful is borne out by the fact that in the winter of 1938-39 geologists of Petroleum Concessions were able to travel in safety tram Khaburah through Ibri - Yanqul - Jebel Hafit to Baraimi, and that many / influential~ 2 ~ influential Sheikhs have recently paid visits to Muscat* Ibri and its neighbourhood is particularly affected by the events to be narrated in this report* Ibri is described at page 767 of the second volume of Lorimer and there is little to add except to say that it still maintains its evil reputation as the ••Thieves Market t&gt; ( ) • The present Sheikh is Abdullah bin Rashid Yakubi| a blind man who is credibly reported as being at the head of a thousand rifles* To the east of Ibri is the town of Dariz which is under the control of Sheikh Ali bin Said of the Beni Qhafir* Both these towns aire marked on the maps published by the Survey of India but unfortunately the position of the large fort of Ainane is not» The fort which is garrisoned by Ali bin Said's Beni Ghafir is the key to the Wadi al Hawasinah and the Northern Dahirah. built It is said to be a stone/building of considerable strength situated in an open plain between Ibri and Dariz^ rather nearer to the latter town* 3* Recent Events * Some little time ago certain men from the Beni Kalban tribe who inhabit the Mi skin — Maqaniyat area murdered adherents of the I main | Mohammad bin Abdullah al Khalili| near the town of Rastaq. The Imam then called upon the Beni Kalban to hand over the murderers which they refused to do* He then threatened to enter their country and undertake operations against them whereupon representat ives from the tribe arrived in Muscat and sought the Sultan's aid. They regard the Sultan as their overlord* The Sultan answered them evasively and promised nothing definite contenting himself with telling them to come to him again if it appeared that the Imam really intended to carry out his threat saying that he would then consider the matter. The Beni Kalban Sheikhs returned to their tribal area. Sixteen days ago the Imam sent forty men under his representative Zahar bin Ghausn Hanai to Ibri* It is not clear if these people were invited to the town by Abdullah bin Rashid or if they were sent on the initiative of the Imam* It is probable that / they were7 they were not invited* Suffice it is to say that Abdullah bin Rashid was sufficiently impressed by the message carried by Zahar bin Ghausn to hand over control of the area to him. The Imam's men have been installed in a strong point and he is in virtual control of the town and very considerable ^ait al Mai 11 (crown lands) on which he vrlll be abls to raise by no means inconsiderable funds# The latest news indicates that Zahar bin Ghausn has left Ibri and returned to Nizwa leaving a token force of only ten men in the town. The reason for this move is doubtful but it would seem that either he has been recalled or more probably that he has gone to make a personal report to the Imani on his mission and will return with a larger force. As soon as the control of Ibri passed to the Imam the Beni Kalban Sheikhs and the Hawasinah Sheikh, Saif bin Sultan, came to Muscat and interviewed the Sultan. The Beni Kalban were not given a definite promise but were told to discuss the situation with the Wali Madhaffar bin Suleiman of Sohar who happened to be in Muscat in connection with affairs at Dhibah. The Sultan after consultation with Modhaffar bin Suleiman sent Sheikh Saif bin Sultan al Hawasinah to Ainane to negotiate with Ali bin Said for the surrender of the fort. He has been instructed to promise Sheikh Ali bin Said that the Sultan will not interfere with his 'crown lands' at Darist and will overlook their disagreement of last year and will be 'kind' to him. The extent of the 'kindness' is an unknown quality and will not be a subject of negotiation as Saif bin Sultan has been told that the fort must be surrendered at once and Ali bin Said must trust to the Sultan 1 s sense of fairness. If the fort is surrendered then the Hawasinah will hold it with a hundred men. The Wali Mudhaff ar bin Suleiman has now returned to Sohar to sound the Dahirah Sheikhs and to organise them in prepared ness for the next move. He has been supplied by the Sultan with a certain amount of money and ammunition to assist him in improving relations with some of the more distant tribes. He has been / ordered to I i \k H4 ordered to return to Muscat immediately after the Id al Zuha on the 9th of this month to make a report on the situation to Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal| who is acting as Regent in the Sultans absence| and has been further instructed to seek an interview with me in order to inform me of the latest events. 4. Sultan's Intentions ♦ It is the Sultan's intention to evict the Imam from Ibri and at least to restore the status quo of three weeks ago. To do this it is essential for him to obtain possession of the key to the position - the fort of Mnane. Should he be successful in obtaining the surrender to his men of Ainane he will at once strengthen the garrison with a detach ment of regular troops with automatic weapons who will be moved from Bait-al-Falaj by way of the Batinah road to Khaburah and then across country to Ghaizain where camel or other pack transport will have to be made available for their onward journey through the Wadi al Hawasinah. I understand from the Sultan that he has no fear of interruption to his line of communication through the Beni Kalban and Hawasinah country. Should the Sultan fail to obtain Ainane by diplomacy it will most probably fall into the hands of the Imam, whose move further north the Sultan will try to prevent by stirring up the tribes in the Dhank - Yanqul - Falaij Beni Qitab area to oppose him (the Sultan) and to harass his left flank while he/completes his preparations for the assault on Ainane. Imam's Intentions . It is very difficult to say with any degree of certainty what the Imam has as his ultimate goal. It would seem that he has moved against Ibri (successfully) as the first move in an operation to acquire control of the western end of the Wadi Hawasinah which is essential if he really intends to take action against the Beni Kalban. At the same time he seems to be undertaking a very large venture to deal with what is really a tribal matter of no particular importance and one which would normally be settled by tribal custom. / I believe hisI believe his intentions to be other than just the punishment of a few tribal murderers. It is possible that he is making an attempt to extend his political influence to whole of the Dahirah up to the 3 Baraimi Oasis which will put him in practical control of the interesting oil country and will open the Batinah to tribal raids. 6* Comments # The Sultan cannot afford to ignore the Imam's incursion into territory under his political control. It is a direct blow at his prestige arid if the movement is continued will place the Sultan in a very awkward position having regard to his agreement with Petroleum Concessions Limited. In addition the Imam will be a constant threat to the Batinah with its rich date gardens and coastal towns with their small but important British Indian trading communities. It is therefore essential for him to take action to restore the position. He VvBa i realises that the allegiance of the Dahirah tribes with one or two exceptions such as the Al Bu Shamis bedouin and,the Alawi at Yanqul will go to the party which can produce the strongest and most effective force. If Ainane falls into the Iman^s hands the Sultan's task will be difficult. if Ainane falls into the Sultan's hands the Imam's position at Ibri will be untenable and he will have to choose between vacating Ibri. and treating the matter as purely a tribal dispute to be settled by tribal custom, or raising his tollowers and undertaking a major operation against the Sultan. Should the Imam adopt the former course the Sultan will probably occupy Ibri and hand over the administration to his representative at Ainane who will probably be Mudhaffar bin Suleiman or Mahmood bin Mohammad bin Turki, Wali of Birkah. It is probable that the Imam will adopt the former course as the latter might easily result in his being forced by flanking movements to vacate Nizwa and retire to his property in the Wadi Samail where he would become virtually a prisoner as the Sultan already holds the eastern entrance while the western entrance is under the control of Sheikh Hamad bin Hamad ar Rawaihi, the Sultan's Wali of Musannah. / Conclusion.6 - u ?• Conclusion , I have been fully informecl of 'the course of events by the Sultan and have at his request discussed the situation with the Military Adviser* The Sultan is leaving for India today but will return should his presence be rendered necessary by develop ments. In the meantime the conduct of affairs is in the hands of Mudhaffar bin Suleiman at Sohari who has the Sultan's confidence, and Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, the Regent, who has not however been informed by His Highness of his intentions. It is known that the Imam is consulting Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi and Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar of Jebel Akhdar and his further action will depend on the result of this conference# Sheikh Isa bin Saleh will not be favourably disposed to warlike operations and his considerable influence will be on the side of peace* Should the Imam obtain the support necessary for his operation it will be sometime before there are any major develop ments in the situation* It will take time to collect tribesmen and in the event of Ali bin Said not surrendering control of Ainane to the Sultan it will be at least a month to six weeks before the TmaTn is in a position to undertake an operation against ■i- Ali bin Said who will certainly resist to the best of his ability, ■f*. The Hawasinah Sheikh will not reach Ainane until about the 17th of this month and I have no doubt much time will be wasted in confer ence. , I will keep you fully informed of the position.

His move was prompted by the action of the Ghafiri tribes to the north and west of Ibri who^not looking with any pleasure on the Hinawi success there.began to collect with the probable intention of taking active measures to turn him out. Minor sub-sections of the Ghafiri tribes are harrying Zahar bin Ghausn at the village of Sibele, where he has halted pending the arrival of the assistance which he has asked the Imam Mohammad bin Abdullah al Khalili to send.him. AINAKB . No change. BSNI KALBAN . Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar has asked the tribal leaders to come to him and has promised to use his good offices to effect a settlement. The Beni Kalban,while expressing gratitude for Suleiman^ offer^have said they would prefer him to come into their territory. OMAN GENSRALLY , It is said that the Imam has appealed to Sheikh Isa bin Saleh Al Harthi to assist in solving the Ibri - Beni Kalban problem but that wily old gentleman has found it convenient to move eastward to answer an invitation from the Beni Bu Ali and the Beni Hassan of the Jaalan to adjudicate between them over their tribal differences. The Imam is said to have appealed to Saqr bin Sultan of the Nairn at Baraimi for assistance but his appeal has not been answered. It is rumoured that the Ghafiri tribes who have so up set the Imam's plans have been encouraged by Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar himself who is of the Ghafiri section.FORECAST . It/ is probable 'that, it Itlq fails t»o obt /ain assis'tance the Imam will appeal to an influential leader such as Sheikh Suleiman bin Sinan of Yankul or possibly even Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar himself to use his good offices to bring about a settlement It is thought unlikely that the Imam will obtain any substantial assistance.fflNFIBSNTIAL .

B P Sir, c V I have the honour to refer to my printed letter No* C/66, dated the 21st January, 1941, and to enclose copies of two notes of mine on recent interviews that I have had with the Regent. 2. The present situation in the Dahirah is that the Imam has effective control of Ibri and has installed Mohammad bin Salim al Raqeshi as his Governor* Zahar bin Ghausn has composed his differ ences with the local tribes at Saleef (wrongly called Sibele in my printed letter under reference) and seems to be content to remain there for the time being* The fort of Ainane is still in the hands of its owner. Sheikh Ali bin Said, the Sultan having failed to obtain possession of it by diplomacy and the Imam having made no attempt to do so by force* The Beni Kalban are still refusing to come to terms with the Imam* The Imam himself is at Bahlah where he was reported to have gathered together a large force but it is now said that he has disbanded his army on Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar's guaranteeing the quiescence of the Ghafiri tribes* 3* The Sultan is in Bombay and, even should he desire to, will probably not be able to return to Muscat for at least a month owing to transport difficulties* I am keeping him fully informed of the situation by telegram and he has so far not given any indi cation of his re-action to the Imam's partial success. He was expecting to meet me in Karachi at the beginning of this month but / unfortunately2 t&gt;l unfortunately I have not been able to get there yet and it will not now be possible for me to discuss the situation with him before the middle of the month. The Sultan may wait until he has had an opportunity of talking things over or he may initiate a counter move by telegram. It will probably be the former course that he will decide upon. 4* The Regent who is taking matters very calmly has a very low opinion of the Omani. He says, with considerable truth, that he will do anything for money and that the pendulum will swing over should the Sultan show any inclination to make monetary presents. The Regent never believed the stories about the Imam's great army as he said the tribesmen would only come for what they could get and would disperse as soon as they discovered that there was little prospect of financial gain. He considers that the Imam's Governor of Ibri will find himself in difficulties in the near future as the tribes in the neighbourhood are a care free lot and if the Governor attempts to enforce the Shara Law, as appears to be his intention, they will soon become restive and the Imam will have to choose between maintaining his position by bribery or force or withdrawing within his original limits and allowing the people of Ibri to continue their, from the Mutawa's point of view, reprehen sible ways. 5. In order to increase the Imam's difficulties until the Sultan's intentions are known the Regent has, like many other leaders in times of crises, decided to hold army mavoeuvres. During the course of next few days a substantial part of the Muscat Force will move to the small village of Adhaba which is fifteen miles from here and is the starting point from the coast for the Wadi Samail. The Wadi Samail is very important strategically to the Imam and he cannot view with equanimity the possibility of the Sultan making a thrust in that direction while he is himself involved with the Dahirah tribes so that this training camp may have the effect of / inducing him3 inducing him to abandon Ibri and return to Nizwa particularly as Sheikh Isa bin Sal eh al Harthi has so far shown no enthusiasm for his manoeuvres in the Dahirah, The Imam's position is not a happy one and he now seems to have decided to rest content with the occupation of Ibri# So far he has made no move in the direction of the Beni Kalban country and it is possible that he is hoping for the arrival of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi sis a mediator. It will be interesting to see what, if any, re-action in Oman is caused by the troops move to Adhaba. at seeing hijn in Bombay unless he decides on earlier action when I will communicate with you immediately.

Saiyid Shahab considered that there was little doubt that Ibri and Saleef were in the hands of the Imam* He considered that the Wali Mudhaffar's information was not absolutely accurate and suspected the Wali Mudhaffar of wishing to quarrel with the Imam. He said that he had received information similar to that which I obtained from Shuin bin Amar and that he had further been recently informed that the Imam had collected an army of at least eight to ten thousand men at Bahlah* He said that in his opinion this last item of information was a gross exaggeration as he could not for the life of him understand where the Imam could raise such a force and pay it| when it was known that Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi had so far not taken any part in the Dahirah trouble* Even if Ainane was occupied by the Imami Saiyid Shahab did not consider that it was possible for the followers of the Khalili to hold the area they had at present acquired for more than a month to six weeks* He felt sure that the Imam 1 s Force would melt away as the prospects of pay and loot dwindled* For his part he was not prepared to give one pie or one round of ammunition unless the Imam made a definite move into the Beni Kalban territory when it would be necessary, firstly, to endeavour by persuasion to settle the trouble between the Beni Kalban and the Imam and, secondly, should persuasion fail to take steps to prevent the Imam from obtaining or as the case may be retaining a foothold in the Beni Kalban territory* 11w Extract from a note on an interview with Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal) Minister for External Affairs f Muscat, on February 5th, 1941, at 10 a.m. at the Consulate. H l. Saiyid Shahab said that he had received letters from the Wall of Sohar which had been addressed to Hamdan bin Saliym by Zahar bin Qhausn and A1 Rekeshi to the effect that the Imam has control of Ibri and that A1 Re\eshi has been appointed Wali oil behalf of the Imam. Further, that the situation is calm and that in future the law of the Shara will govern Ibri* Saiyid Shahab has also heard that the Beni Kalban^still recalcitrant and are prepared to resist by force any attempt on the part of the Imam to enter their country. It is rumoured that the Imam has disbanded his force at Bahlah on an undertaking having been given by Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar to be responsible for the conduct of the Ghafiri tribes. Saiyid Shahab has suggested to the Adviser that it would be a good thing to hold a training camp at Adhaba, and it is probable that certain of the Bait-al-Falaj troops will move out for further training within a week. Saiyid Shahab's idea is that the purpose for which the troops are going to Adhaba should not be announced and that the Imam should thereby find himself in some doubt about the exact reason for this move. Adhaba is where the WscLi Samail track leaves the coast and is about fifteen miles from here.'pnwTTTDENTIAL &gt; v«««- v?

There has been no radical change in the situation in the Ibri area since the report contained in my letter under reference• The Sultan has received a communication from Sheikh Isa bin Sal eh al Harthi acquainting him with the Imam's move to Ibri and stating that the action was taken in response to an invitation ffom Abdullah bin Rashid al Yakubi who informed the Imam that he was afraid of his son taking control and saying that if the Imam was reluctant to aid him then he would be forced to seek the protection of Ibn Saud. Sheikh Isa bin Saleh seems also to have hinted that the Sultan had evinced little interest in the area and made no attempt to preserve law and order in a notoriously lawless district. Sheikh Isa*s letter, as is usual in his communications, contains a great deal of truth used to the best advantage to give a plausible reason for the Imam's action. The Sultan is as adept as Sheikh Isa at this form of comriunication and will not find the letter hard to answer. 3. The Sultan has no intention of permitting the Imam to remain in possession of Ibri but he does not intend to take any action until he returns to Muscat early next month unless the Imam endeavours to enlarge his present sphere of influence. On his7 return he will answer Sheikh Isa 'bin Salens letter and I gather will declare his strong disapproval of the Iman^s action and suggest that Sheikh Isa advises him to withdraw pointing out that Abdullah bin Rashid al Yakubi should have been advised by the Imam on Receipt of his letter to apply to his overlord,the Sultan for assistance. The Sultan will probably add that he proposes to take such action as may be necessary to ensure that the control of Ibri and the surrounding district is such that there will be a cessation of lawlessness# I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Major, Political Agent &amp; H.B.M 1 s Consul, Muscat. 1 I ' Copy sent to G «of i»&gt;I*0»f A»0»G«f ira^i arjd MSIG• under P.L.No.lQO-S of 12.4 # 4l f ref.our P.L.No.C/82 of aTelegram S From Political Agent, Muscat# To Political Resident, Bushire.

There are numbers of rumours circulating concerning the object of^the meeting in Ja'alah and the Imam's atti-' tude towards it. To relate these would serve no useful purpofce for it is clear that Sulaiman bin Hamyar of the Nabhani, Ali bin Abdullah of the Beni Bu Ali and Isa Bin Saleh al Harthi have met and come to some decision. They must either require the Sultan's co-operation, or have a demand to make from him. Whatever it may be the Sultan does not seem to be taking the matter seriously, for he has sent a casual reply to Sulaiman bin Hamyar, though once he did agree to see him at Masirah. 'think that the trouble has been caused by the mishandling oi the supply situation by the Muscat Customs, and that the Sheikhs are demanding some reform. This, in my opinion, is called for and I shall ask the Sultan to in vestigate the matter after his arrival at Muscat.

In Delhi I obtained the Sultan's concurrence to my visiting the Jabal Akhdhar, and so on nQr return I wrote to Shaikh Sulaiman bin Hamyar suggesting a visit. He replied saying that he would welcome a visit from me, but added that he was leaving his own country for the 'green country of the east'. He has since this written again inviting me to visit him. 3. As it was unlikely that he would be back in the Moun tain within a month, and as it was certain that by then I should not have the time to make the journey, I decided to make a pre liminary visit to Shaikh Hamad bin Hamid at Jeneh, close to Moti, at the foot of the Mountain beyond the V /adi Sumail in the Wadi Ruwahi. 4. I therefore asked R^i Bahadur Gokaldas to obtain some fast camels, and suggested to him that he might accompany me. This he did, and I am grateful for his company and assistance. We/- hon'ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K .G.I.E., ' itical Resident in the Persian Gulf, s H I RE. | | | , ^ BU8HIRE RE^'O'iNCY. I NO- 1*7 Da' s- 'f'9-2- We set out from Sib by lorry to the foot of the hills where, after considerable difficulty from the guide lost the way, we picked up the camels which had been sent on ahead overnight, ue entered the hills at Rasal, and continued eastwards up the Wadi Rasal for some two hours, and passed the small villages of Jafnain and Maraira. At Maraira the track winds through the hills, and alter passing Batih, leads to Fingeh. There V/as no running water in the valley in contrast to many others we travelled in later, and the village water supplies are from wells. The hillsides near the villages bristle with old watch towers, all of which are abandoned. Fingeh can be described as a small 107.01, and is situated on a northern slope overlook ing miles of line date gardens planted on the north side of the river bed. There is a fair sized perennial stream of sweet water Vthich supplies tne town and gardens. The town is pro tected by two large towers situated on promontories at each end of the tov.n which is built on a cliff overhanging the val- ley« These fores were newly whitewashed, and in good repair. 5. From Fingeh we rode southwards up the valley passing the villages ol Sharu, 'Anikat, Milayana and Kurta until we arrived at Bidb id. This is a large village which gets its importance from the presence of a square serai type of fort in which the ^ali lives. Neither he, nor the Qazi, were there when I passed through. At Bidbid I saw for the first time fields of wheat and other crops watered from channels on the Persian system. There are only date palms at Fingeh. and we found it impossible to buy lucerne for our camels there. Fod der^ should be brought from Eidbid, and I think we were thought to be rather stupid for not knov/ing this. 6. From Bidbid we rode over a broad stony plain for about two hours before we entered the Wadi Sumail, north of Surur. Surur is the most northerly village of a number dotted at in tervals along the banks of the valley for about 12 miles. At the northern end of the valley the date and fruit gardens are not remarkable for their fertility or the size of the trees, but in the centre of the valley in the neighbourhood of the fort 1 saw the finest date gardens I have ever seen. There are large/--3- large mango and other fruit trees also. We spent one night at Sumail in the guest house of the Y/ali. He was most hospi table and friendly, and sent me a lamb for dinner. This was a great treat, especially for dwellers in Muscat where the only meat killed, except on rare occasions, is one goat a day. He told me that the lack of rain in the last few years had resulted in a diminition in the number and size of the flocks due to the lack of grazing. This may be so, and it is quite true that there are very few flocks to be seen. With the next breath, however, ne complained the excess of rain last summer had ruined the date crop. To point out that the rain would eventually re sult in an addition to the water supply by reviving the springs was a too long-term policy to be received with favour. The rain does not really spoil the date crop, but the drying of the dates. In Oman there is a kind of date which they gather just before it is ripe, and boil in large earthenware pots. They then spread the boilea dates on the river bed to dry. If it rains dur?!.ng the drying period considerable loss is sustained. V. At Sumail numbers of Sheikhs and the leading Qazi visited me in the guest house garden where I sat under the large mango trees. They talked a little of the war, but did not show ma^ interest in it beyond its effect upon themselves. They asked me if the 'control system 1 were an invention of the British Gov ernment, and if I thought that it was necessary. They said that it caused great hardship to themselves as it resulted in their being short of cloth and grain. I replied say.ing that certainly in war time it was absolutely necessary to control supplies, when we were warming to the conversation the Wali suddenly asked to be allowed to leave for a few minutes. Whereupon he and his greybeards went away and held a confabulation just out of earshot behind the guest house They came back after what seemed an in terminable time, for it was nearly 11 O'clock at night and I had been riding all day, and turned to the weather as a subject of conversation. I suppose their native caution had overcome them. S. The ^umail fort is a large stone building perched on a rock some 100 feet high in the middle of the valley where it broadens out a little. There is a small bazaar there where stinking fish is/-% -A- is sold. The people buy small quantities of this, and carry- it home dangling on a piece of stick, and that is not to be wondered at either. The entrance to the valley from the south is guarded by two large forts also situated on the top of out crops of rock. I took photographs of these, but could not do so of the Sumail fort as the Wali said that the taking of photo graphs was against his religion. It is from the south of Sumail that the Jabal Akhdhar is first seen. 9. We continued our journey over barren stony country in a broad valley about 10 miles across. After a 3 hours* ride it narrov/ed to a pass by which we entered the Wadi Ruwahi. The northern entrance of this valley is guarded by the usual towers and forts built on rocky promontories, but here the fortifications are strengthened - or were for all is now falling to pieces - by a wall linking them up. There was more soil here and each village - we passed Mingeah, Ghelay and Mureila - has its wheat fields ir rigated in the Persian style, as well as date gardens and mango trees. After a 5 hours' fast ride we arrived at Jeneh at the southern end of the Vnadi Ruwahi. This is the home of Sheikh Hamad bin Hamid, who was once in the service of the Sultan of Muscat, but who now lives on his own property through which travel lers from Muscat and the Batinah must pass to reach Nezwa, the town of his father-in-law, the Imam. He was very pleased to see me, and during the halt of a day and a half took me for walks in the hills and gardens. He asked numerous questions about the war, and regretted that his radio was out of order. I have sent it to India for repairs, but after its return am faced with the problem of supplying him with charged batteries. 10. He told me that the Imam was very ill and that it was not thought that he would live much longer. He said that that v/as the reason for Sheikh Sulaiman bin Hamyar's going to Kamil to meet Sheikh Isa Bin Saleh al Harthi. They wished to settle^a policy to follow after the Imam's death. According to Hamad bin Hamid their plan was to divide Oman into two parts, and for Sulai man bin Hamyar to rule the western part and Isa bin Saleih the eastern. Hamad was concerned that the Sultan v/as apparently plac ing no part, and he asked me if I know the reason. I knew nothing about/-4; -5- tho^h that th^ P T !f S sc There is no doubt ou , SOme bls S™ 6 afoot ' ^ not only have the leading Sheikhs met at Kamil and sent a message to the' w^ld r t- ve'dirort 1 '^ aS + ed me ' the Eritish G^emment tS^ ol^e ? actl ° n + t ° assis t should a certain event / Place.

It would be difficult to use it all for the banks of the valley are rocky and steep and unsuited to cultivation. An attempt was once made to carry it from one valley to another as is evidenced by a long water channel built well up the moun tain side so as to keep the water at a high level to X get it over a saddle into the next valley. The story is that the ■.York was started by a rich man to take water to an almost water less village as an inducement to a certain villager to part with a lovely daughter. They say that the rich man died before he had completed the work. 13* The journey I am afraid does not make an exciting tale, but as a preliminary it has achieved more than I could have hoped for in establishing contact with the Jabal Akhdhar Sheikhs, and ascert, ining their attitude towards the British Government. to 3/ » tt) f t. t\o732-S 7i 6a58-ME/45 e ///a. £ New Del hi,the Ist May 1945.

When I saw him shortly after my return from recess, the Sultan told me that he was very pleased with the result of his talks with the Oman: Shaikhs. He had found Shaikh Sulaiman's attitude particularly encouraging and said he felt that this might be the beginning of a more general move of the Shaikhs of the hinterland in his favour.

Sahikh Sulaiman bin ^arayar of the Jebel Akhdar and Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah of the 3eni Bu Ali left Muscat on the 30th after what appeared to have been a very successful visit, and it is not improbable that the satisfactory relations which the Sultan has succeeded in establishing with them will have important consequences in the future. Shaikh Sulainan bin Hamyar, the principal Shaikh of the Beni Nabhan, occuoies a key oosition in Oman affairs and has hitherto been one of the main supporters of the Imam. Lis tribe(which in the 12th century established a dynasty of 'Kings' who ruled over the greater part of the interior for over 250 years) is a powerful one and controls the Wadi Samail which forms one of the most important routes into Oman. Both Shaikhs gave His highness an assurance of their support and stated that tl ey would take no part in the election and with the future of the Imamate received Shaikh' Isa bin Salih of the Sharqiyyah, His Highness hopes of the eventual collapse of the Imamate and the unification of State under his rule. 4 Shaikh Sulaiman who had never before travelled beyond the boundary of Oman was obviously determined to lose no time in bringing himself up-to-date. At his request arrangements were made for him to see the Cable and Wireless station and to be taken round one of the B.I. Steamers which arrived during his visit. He soent several hours observing the Cable Instruments and subjected the Manager of Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. to a most exhaustive examinaticn regarding the working of the station. On board the steamer he insisted on seeing the engire-room and sloke-hold although efforts v/ere made to disuade 1 im by the Captain and Chief Engineer. Arab etiquette having obliged him to leave his sandals on deck, he was forced to retire from the stoke-hold ^ore quickly than he had intended as the hot )lates burnt the soles of his feet. of the Imam's successor.

Reference my The Sultan visited me recently at the Agency to discuss the State Budget for 194-5, and, when I again drew his attention to the need for in vesting the now substantial reserves in his Treasury, he replied that he did not intend to make any decision on this until December vthen he hoped to have a clearer idea of the way in which affairs in Oman might develop. He then went on to discuss in some detail his hopes for the consolidation of his authority in Oman. 2. No Ruler of Muscat, he said, could remain satisfied with the present state of affairs. In the past the sense of frustration produced by the realisation chat, with the meag^t- resources of his State, there Wc-s little hope of the re- establishment of the authority of his House in Oman in his time, had made him feel acutely despondent. Now however the position had changed: the State was sound financially and had a substantial reserve; he was now able to entertain and give presents to the influential Shaikhs of the interior in a manner befitting his position; and above all he now had the means to acquire arms and ammunition to enable him to support his growing influence with force. The Imam could not be expected to live much longer: with a show of force and the support he hoped to receive from the tribes, action taken immediately the news of the Imam'£-| death was received would enable him to re-occupy Oman without bloodshed. He intended to make no move until the Imam died, but in the mean time wishe : to make whatever preparations were possible, firstly by encouraging friend ly relations with the more important Shaikhs, and secondly by preparing plans for military operations designed to seize certain of the forts. The first of these two preparatory stages was his concern, but the second on 7 /hich everything depended - would only be possible with the assistance of the British Government. He would require additional military stores and equipment, including artillery and would need the assistance of British officers. In discussing these affairs he wished to make it clear that whatever advice were given him by the British Government he would accept, though he sincerely hoped that this would not be unfavourable to his in tentions. His aims were clearly reasonable, for without its unification - / ^ S- (0' tfi under/- (Signature) s. 44.

Assuming that no such radical change in our attitude of non-interference ■. ith the interior cr-i be conter.plated, it would, I su.7 jest, be unv/ise for us to associate ourselves directl; v.ith the Sultc-n's aims and thereby incur responsibilities woch Vve are not prepared to carry out to the full.- Cur general policy should, I submit, continue to be one of strengthening 'the authority of the Sultan while making ?'t clear that the extension of his influence mst be at his responsibility and achieved by his own exertions.

The healthy condition of tl e State Treasury is alreac be ;innin ' to exert a strong centripetal force, against wl ich the Imam las no effective counter measure, and given the necessary materials to discourage Hin£wi opposition, the Sultan would probably hrve little difficulty in re-establishing himself.

His Highness has now received invitations from Shaikhs Ali bin Abdullah of the Eeni Bu Ali and Sulaiman bin Hamiyar of the Beni Riyam to visit them at their headquarters at Jaalan and the Jebel Akhdhar. The first of these invitations the Sultan has accepted, and has decided to make the journey to Jaalan in the first week of April. This is the first time that His Highness has been able to regard his relations with Shaikh Ali as suffi ciently satisfactory to permit his presence amongst the Beni Bu Ali and he is, therefore, anxious to make full use of his present advantage regarding the successful outcome of his visit as a mat ter of the highest importance to himself and his Government. 3. The particular significance of this development would appear to provide a suitable moment for indicating to this power ful tribe and to the assembly of Jeneba Shaikhs and their retinues who will also be present that the consolidation of the Sultan's authority in this area has our fullest support. If you agree with this view, I would suggest for your consideration that a de monstration by Royal Air Force aircraft over Jaalan during the Sultan's visit might be the best way of making our attitude clear. Ras al Hadd aerodrome which is in close proximity to Jaalan would provide a convenient base for such an operation. 4. As regards the second invitation for him to visit the Beni Riyam, His Highness has wisely judged that the moment for him to venture into Oman has not yet come and has informed Shaikh Sulaiman of his inability to accept. In course of conversation, however, he suggested to me tliat I might like to visit the Jebel Akhdhar and mentioned the possibility of Saiyid Tariq bin Taimur accompanying me.

At subsequent interview he stated he was grateful to His Majesty*s Government for assistance promised but was disappoint ed that no reference was'made to use of R.A.F.- Air support at any critical stage he regarded as sine qua non to his' undertaking* operations in' Oman for reasons' that' (i) he could not ignore possibility of combined opposition from a few of the' more powerful tribes' (especially from the SHARi^IYAH) proving too' strong for his ? forces ' (ii) he could not feel Justified in investing large proportion of his financial resources in consolidation of his authority unless success was assured and (iii) that his resources would not ? permit long drawn out struggle. He'requested specific statement from H.M.G. on this point adding that if this was unfavourable he would not proceed further with his plans. 3. Sultan also requested if ? use of R.A.F. in EMERGENT circumstances was agreed to he should be given- assurance that (a) as rifles and' ammunition which H.M.G. had agreed to' supply him'would be required for his irregular forces, any reasonable additional needs of Levies for purpose in view ? would be supplied separately; and (b) that in event of operations proving more difficult than ? he would have anticipated further supplies for irregular forces would be immediately available, I consider this request'reasonable. 4. I strongly urge favourable consideration of Sultan's request for assistance by R.A.F. His reasons for this are cogent and he can be relied on to do everything possible to avoid situation arising which would necessitate air'action. To avoid general unrest throughout Oman supp ression of any strong opposition in shortest time is' in my view'essential., Only method of ensuring this is availability of ? air support.

Royal Air Force have made extensive use of Sultan's territories in past years (sometimes to his embarrassment) and it is in their interest that he should maintain his control. Moreover fact that Sultan has made specific request (which could if considered desirable be obtained from him in writing) for such assistance would answer any accusation of interference in sovereignty of an independent State. Should such assistance be denied and Sultan be forced to Live up his plans it will embitter him, destroy our good relations over many years with him, and render difiicult the obtaining of any facilities we may require in the future. - PRIOR - Persian Gulf Residency, tit _ t-co q Bushire, * the 3rd f ay 1946.

It is true we have promised him assistance to this end but ha is awaiting death of Imam before making a move vide paragraph 4 of Prior's letter Ho. 84-S of January 15th. Meanwhile any attempt to force the pace or to enter into separate negotiations with Imam or Shaikhs of interior is likely to prejudice eventual success of Sultans pians.

It is, there fore impossible to be precise at this stage ? but I ? consider additional requirements of rifles for levies are not likely to exceed 200. 3. Reference paragraph 3 of your telegram. I do not think that it was Political Resident's intention to restrict supplies of rifles and ammunition to . uscat levies only (mortars and machine guns would of course be for levies). It has all along been clear that Sultan ? w ill need both regular and irregular forces to achieve his aims if only for reason that dependence on regular troops only would demand a force which it would be beyond resources of State to maintain. 4.

His Ma.iestv's Government have ? carefullv examined proposal for promising ? Sultan of l^uscat Royal Air Force assistance in reasserting authority over the interior. They recognise reasons in favour of proposal particularly as a means of hastening the time when Petroleum Concessions Limited will be able to survey possible ? oil bef^ing areas of the interior hitherto in accessible on the ground. They are however averse in principle from use of threat of force in independent state even at ruler f s request since this might well lead to blood shed and would almost certainly give rise to criticism and misinterpretation in interested quarters. It might even lead to His Majesty 1 s Government being arraigned before the Security Council of the United Nations. Mere demonstrations by flying over would not be sufficient unless it were accompanied by demand (eg. by dropping leaflets) for sub mission of tribesman to Sultans authority. To be effective such demand would have to be backed by the threat of air action in the event of refusal to comply. 2. It is in any case from His Majesty's Govern ments point of view very desirable ? that oil development should take place as soon as possible. While it is possible that plan proposed by Sultan wouibd be (mut) est way of effectingeffecting this, it might, since its timing is dependent on the ? death of the Imam involve in fact considerable delay. It has been suggested here that as a means of securing earlier access for Oil Company suitable financial inducements in Sultan 1 s name might succeed in securing co-operation of tribal chiefs# It might be possible for Oil Company to supply the necessary funds. Such a plan of peaceful penetration might even be an alternative to Sultan 1 s programme of proceeding by force but in any case might be of use for limited purpose of securing early access for Oil Company to those ares in which they are interested.

Reference paragraph 2 of my telegram 1^41^ of . Assistance to Sultan of Muscat in establishing authority over interior. 2. rollowing is plan that has been suggested. A small and well equipped expedition, to be led by a British Politiosil omoex. and to include technical oil experts., (with suitable armed escort provided by the Sultan; should be despatched to gain contact with the leading bheikhs in selected areas. It would be the task of the leader of the expedition to explain to them the Sultan's intention to press forward with the economic development of the ccnintry by g I kj exploitation of potential oil resources and to impress on the local Sheikhs the advantages they would obtain from co-operating in this policy. 3* As proof of the Sultan's good intentions, this representative would take with him and distribute to the tribal | leaders gifts calculated to make the greatest appeal to the recipients and would promise that more would be forthcoming if the tribesmen agreed to co-operate. The expedition, being small woSd S S 0t man;7 gifts in kind ^ thQ first Paymente no doubt have to be made largely in cash. The expedition /mightlight, however, usefully distribute some samples affording practical demonstration of the advantages of enhanced economic prosperity that would be enjoyed by the region, as shown by the higher standards of living now enjoyed by the States, e.g, Bahrein, where oil development has already begun. ^ k* The essence of the scheme is that a 'want' should be created in the minds of the tribesmen and that they should be brought to connoot the satisfaction of this want with tho exploitation of the oil deposits in such a manner that they will welcome, or at least not oppose, further expeditions. The Sultan is presumably better qualified than wo are to know what would appeal to the tribesmen and as the scheme would bo carried out under his authority, it may appeal to him. It would cost him little or nothing and he would thereby not only begin to strengthen his influence over the tribesmen, but would also be opening the way to a possible substantial increase in his own revenues in the shape of oil royalties. 5* Another Arab ruler, Ibn Saud, has achieved conspicuous success in controlling his tribesmen by subsidies rather than by armed force, 6. Obviously, further consideration must be given to this scheme before we could embark upon it and I should accordingly be grateful ior your observations at an early date. If you are reasonably satisfied that the Sultan's acceptance in principle of such a scheme could be obtained if sought, I should be grateful for your views on the following points:- (1) (2) (3) (4) &amp;/1 /- &amp;&amp;/£/ a an indication of the areas to be visitedj the timing and duration of the operation; size and composition of the party; strength and armament of the escort; and approximate overall cost, which would include cash subsidy to be placed at Sultan's disposal, with /pajrtioulars3. particulars of tha volumo and nature of any goods which it is thought may appeal to the tribusmen. ' You should also state whether one expedition would suffice or whether a series of tours would have to be undertaken, 7* If cost is likely to be more than Oil Company might reasonably be expected to meet, question of contribution by British or Indian revenues might be considered# 1 ' ' (ihe issue of the above has been duly authorised)/ ; V /. sa J: SECRET Note of a Mooting held at the India Office on 12th June, 194.6.

It was agreed, however, that it would be worth while asking the Company whether assistance from the R.A.P. would bo or any use to them, if they had not their own aircraft for the purpose. 8. 1 r:e c onclusions of the meeting wore as follows: (a) The reasons in favour of promising the Sultan R .A .P. assistance at this stage, when the date of the Imam's death could not be foretold, wore not solidly enough grounded to outweigh the disadvantages. (b) Such assistance however as was possible should be given to the Oil Company to carry out a survey of the interior in order to assess the oil prospects of Oman, and they might be asked-whether the --. a . P . could give them any useful assistance in this direction. The pos^ioility of providing the Sultan with money for gifts to distribute to local chiefs might also be considered in this connection 9# The India Office undertook to discuss the matter in general erns with rupr^r^n native:• of P.

Essential point in Sultan^ aims is that he wishes first to establish his ? authority and later to permit controlled exploitation of natural resources. His Majesty^ Government 1 s proposals which are confined to ways and means of giving Oil Company access to Oman will certainly cause acute disappointment and I find it difficult to estimate effect this will have on Sultan. 3^ Correspondence on this subject shows sultan is fully cognisant of advantage of securing co-operation of tribal chiefs by financial inducements but that he has not succeeded in persuading them to abandon their allegiance to Imam. His decision to take no action until death of Imam is sound and wisdom of advising him to act now is very question able# In ? recent times main reason for .ultan's inability N to negotiate for access of oil and locust parties to interior has been his desire to avoid recognising authority of Imam rather than to lack of funds. 4# It is essential that we should work through Sultan if a crisis in our political relations with him is to be avoided. Intensification of efforts at peaceful infiltration would meet with greater approval from Sultan if this were to be carried out by his Government. This desideratum could perhaps be met if proposed party v.-ere led byIU&gt; -2- by Sultan's British Adviser assisted if necessary by Oil Company technicians. ? I feel it most desirable that initiative in this ? matter should come as far as possible from Sultan. I therefore suggest that next step might be exploratory talks during which he would be ? informed of His Majesty f s Government's decision against direct assistance and at which His Majesty's Government's desire to help him in ? financial and other ways would be communicated to him. These talks are likely to be of a delicate nature vide paragraph 10 of my express letter No.S 1126 dated August 1945 and Political Resident's telegram No.682 dated May 3rd 1946.

At first sight I must confess that I feel myself somewhat doubtful about the success of the proposed scheme even if the Sultan were to accept it. It must he remembered that the majority of the tribes of the interior owe no allegiance of any kind to the Sultan and at present show little or no desire to - ^ come under his sway. I feel that if the expedition were to set out as proposed accompanied by an armed escort provided by the Sultan some kind of clash wou3d be inevitable unless the groijnd had been long and carefully prepared before-hand, which is not the case* 3. With regard to paragraph 4 of the Express Letter under reference so far as I know the 'want' is already there and some if not all of the tribes are anxious for any oil deposits in their country to be exploited. They want however to reap the full benefits of such exploitation themselves and not to share them with the Sultan. Lermitte reports that when he visited Baraimi last year some tribesmen from Ibri definitely invited him to explore their country. It would therefore I think be comparatively easy to enter into direct relations with the tribes. This however would have a disastrous effect on the Sultan and would probably result either in his abdication or in his retirement to Dhofar and neglect of the affairs of his State. His one ambition is to obtain control of the interior but he can do very little towards this until the Imam dies. Meanwhile he is unwilling to negotiate with the tribes of the interior for the access for oil or locust parties as this cannot be done without recognising the authority of the Imam which he is endeavouring to undermine. If we deal direct with the tribes now we shall certainly prejudice the Sultan's chances of obtaining control over them after the Imam's death. 4. The problem is a difficult one. We want the oil urgently and the tribes are probably willing to let us have it if we find it provided we deal with them direct.

We must first tell him that we cannot give him iv 1 ad3 ance ^ in hi8 8chemes to* subjugating Oman together with the reasons for our refusal. This will undoubtedly oe ^ gre^t disappointment to him and may make subseauent negetiations more difficult but we must be frank with him. 8te P wil1 to explain to him how urgently necessary it is for us to search for oil in Oman and exploit any deposits that may be found there. We should tell him that ^ Possible for us to do this by direct dealings witt. tue tribes and that we cannot afford to wait for the Imam s aeath which may not take place for some years. We should then aak him whether he has afiy scheme to suggest whereby we can obtain what we want and at the same time save his face. 6. Lermitte has informed me that the first expedition which his Company wish to organise is planned to start from Ras al Khaimah and work southwards through Baraimi to Dhank and Ibri. it will then work down the Wad i Howasinah ana i rom there turn northwards and explore both sides of the main range• Last year a P.C.L. party visited Baraimi ana the «ebel Hafit and was able to carry out its work .-H there without any serious interference vide paragraph 4 of enclosure to India Office Printed Letter Ho. Jttkt. 3167/46-, tf.ated the Qtii May 1946. The Sultan was not asked to send V* ft . a representative although he claims part of Baraimi ani a 45 rebonta.tiye of his was present when the Company carried^ *rc&gt;- out explorations there in 1958. On that occasion it was found that the representative had little or no influence locally. Indications are, cf. paragraph 3 above, that the Company would encounter little difficulty in continuing their explorations during the coming cold weather as far south as Ibri. To what extent they could carry out the rest oi their programme as stated by Lermitte with or without the Sultan's co-operation I am not at present in a position to say. I consider however that we must do all we can to obtain the Sultan's acquiescence in their programme and that we must accept any reasonable proposal he makes to ensure that his interests do not suffer. If he refuses to accord his approval we shall have to decide whether we should carry on without it. This will be a difficult decision to make and on the whole I am inclined to think that at any rate for the time being we should not allow the Company to carry out their programme without the Sultan's concurrence but that we should go on presaing him to give it. 7« So far as I can see there is nothing in the Agreanent of 24th June 19 37 made between the Company and the Sultan to prevent the Company from approaching the Oman tribes direct but such action would be against the spirit of Article 12 of the Agreement. Further it would appear that the Company would be bound to pay the Sultan the full royalties etc. under Articles 6 and 11 of the Agreement aixi that any payments made by them to the tribes would be in addition to this. 8.

The Sultan's requirements are - (a) additional military stores and equipment including artillery, (b) assistance of British Officers, (c) an indication of the degree of support which he might expect from H.M.G. 15, As regards (a) Ur^ can scarcely refuse to assist, whether v/e insist on payment or not for such supplies, as he would tU find no great difficulty in procuring his requirements from | || America or elsewhere. 16, It is unlikely that H.M.G. will agree to (b). 17, The Sultan wants a reply to (c) as soon as possible to enable him to seize an opportunity which might occur at any time (para 3 of p.u.c.) so even if we temporise we cannot do so for long. / Now . . . ■ i i % i36/112 Now that the war with Japan is over the argument that 18. any interference by the Sultan in the hinterland which might lead to disturbances would be unwelcome to H.M.G. has lost its force. The consolidation of Oman under the Sultan would not 19. only benefit the State but would facilitate oil develop ment and anti-locust operations in this are.a, a question of intergnational interest, 4 One cannot but sympathise with the Sultan 1 s .desire 20. to restore his forefathers' rule over the hinterland,and it would seem politic to /assist him to do so to the fullest extent compatible with any restrictive inter^national committments that H.M.G. may be bound by. A/7y{tuL*c /U /' ' n i nk 11.1(X45 c r J - x I The matter is one for Sir Geoffrey Prior himself 22. to deal with and the following notes may be of use. As regards the Muscat authority in the past over 23. Oman see Lorimer page 1419 end of main paragraph which shows where Walis were posted. I see that there was a i uscati all actually at Holy ^ezwaj the Imam's capital. Note para 15. I do not like the idea of supply- 24, ing more arms to Muscat, but as U.S. says we may find it difficult to refuse thoiigh the Sultan says that he will abide by our advice. I think on this point we might first check to whom the Sultan would actually entrust the arms for even without extra supplies the levies are wel] armed now. Also before we provide further artillery it would seem to be advisable to ascertain if there are trained personnel for this35/112 ;' 5' IIP additional armament and that the Sultan will continue to employ a British Officer and Indjan Officers in the Levies. 5. Note para 16, I should not think that H.M.G. would agree, but even if a force moves up the Wadi Sumail the Military Adviser would be taking part in the operations. His duties to my way of thinking are normally defensive and his services were lent for that purpose. Whether the Sultan may employ him offensively on what can be termed a 'war of aggression on the Omanis 1 is quite a different matter. 6. Note para 17. I agree we have to reply to the Sultan. 7. Note para 19. I agree that consolidation of Oman under the Sultan would be an advantage. In fact P.C.L. have a concession from the Sultan in which 'Oman' is included. It is unlikely that H.L/i.G. would view with disfavour a strong state in the south of Arabia. 8. Note para 20. I agree we should assist the Sultan but I cannot cast my vote for armed intervention. The difficulties which would face a column in the Wadi Sumail are great and that is only one of the Wadis which, presumably. ' i would have to be traversed, even if only for demonstration. It is also a moot point if having obtained an initial success the Sultan could maintain the position. A reversal would be disastrous and might necessitate British forces again defending Muscat and Matrah. . 29. It is somewhat doubtful to my mind if we want the Sultan to move his capital inland; P.A. does not say to which town. Rastaq was the old inland capital. ;0, The question of the reversal of the 1920 Treaty does not really arise since that only achieved a truce and a main demand of the Omanis, i.e. acceptance of their independ ence by Muscat was cut out by Mr. Wingate, though in fact the Omanis obtained virtual independence .(page 262 File 36/112 Vol A 29). The ^ultan only intends to move after the death of the Imam. H, I am afraid I doubt the fighting effectiveness of the35/112 Muscat Levies but in any case I do not think H.M.G. will ever countenance the actual use of force. We have also to consider the effect of a resort to arms by the Sultan in adjacent territory. It is not at all beyond the bounds of possibility that Trucial Coast Shaikhs might not follow this example. Personally before making any recommendation I should like to know what has taken place ir the recent negotiations the P.A. reports and if the Sultan requires, as he does, H.lVi.G's assistance he should inform us of the progress made. A solution by tribal confederation seems to call for 33. consideration and the possibility of the Sultans being elected Imam by peaceful coercion. 32.

Uo S.78 1 . i discussed the scheme with Colonel Galloway who is not in favour of it and considers that any expedition accompanied by armed force would probably meet with tribal opposition. The fact is that most of the tribes concerned do not recognise the Sultan's authority but would be only too willing to deal direct with the Oil Company 1 s representatives. if on the other hand we cut the sultan out of the negotiations he wili be bitterly offended and may abdicate or go into permanent retirement at Dhofar. The situation is a very difficult one but i think Y ;e shall have to endeavour to persuade the bultan to agree to our negotiating direct with the ttribes at any rate in the Dhank and Ibri areas which according to Mr. ijeimitte the Company are srixious to explore first. Arrangements could perhaps be made for a representative of the Sultan to accompany the party. P.A.Muscats views may be awai ted. y 20/7/46 ' PA. ^ k.if 40.7.^.
