CONPIPENTIAL. (10207.) MEMORANDUM RESPECTING THE NAVIGATION OF THE TIGRIS AND EUPHRATES.. Introductory Note. This Memorandum is divided into four parts :— Part I.—History. The first part deals with the history of British relations with Turkish Arabia, in connection with the navigation of the Mesopotamian rivers, and is designed to show the origin and progress of those relations with the view of determining the rights, whether acquired by prescription or grant, which Great Britain possesses of participating in the trade and navigation of those rivers. This part will naturally fall into two sub divisions :— (a.) The first, dealing with the earlier period, viz., 1579 to 1859, is concerned with the acqui sition of rights by the East India Company, which eventually became merged in those obtained by the British Government, and by the British Government for its own vessels and for the vessels and commerce of British subjects generally; and (6.) The second part deals with the period commencing in 1860 and continuing to the present time, which is concerned with the main tenance of British rights generally and with the acquisition and maintenance of special privileges on behalf of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Messrs. Lynch and Co.). In this part the treaties and other arrange ments entered into by the Ottoman Government with Great Britain and with other Powers, are only briefly alluded to, as they are more fully discussed in the second part. Part II.—Treaties. The second part discusses the rights accruing to Great Britain from treaties between herself and the Ottoman Empire and between the Ottoman Empire and other nations. Part HI.— Conclusion. The third part contains a statement of the various conclusions which may be deduced from the details contained in the first two parts [163—5]11 Part IV.—Chronology. The fourth part contains a precis, in strictly chronological order, of MS. correspondence and various other papers, with an annex. Appendices. Various appendices are annexed, which contain in full the principal documents referred to in this Memorandum. The information required for the preparation of the Memorandum has been taken from 1. The MS. records of the Foreign Office. 2. The MS. archives of the Constantinople Embassy, of the years 1834—1860, now in the custody of the Record Office. 3. A few of such India Office MSS. as have been accessible. 4.

THE origin and early history of British trade in Turkish Arabia is so intimately connected with the history of the East India Company that a few details concerning that company may be of interest. It was in 1579 that Queen Elizabeth, through the agency of an English merchant, William Harburn, obtained permission for English mer chants to resort to, and trade with, Turkey as freely, in all respects, as French, Venetians, Germans, and Poles then did. The company was founded at the end of the six teenth century, and received a Royal charter from Queen Elizabeth on the 31st December, 1600. Eor many years it carried on the Indian trade subject to the attempts of various other English merchants to obtain a share in it; at length these endeavours culminated in the formation of a second company. In order to overcome the disadvantages of this competition steps were taken by the tw T o companies to come to terms, and they were united in 1709 under the title of the East India Company. This company continued until 1858, when the administration of India was transferred to the Crown, and the company ceased to exist. The first attempt to trade with Bussorah appears to have been made by the East India Company in 1639, when a voyage was undertaken to that place, and permission was obtained from the Bashaw ' to land goods under more favour able circumstances than any other Europeans enjoyed.' Shortly afterwards a factory appears to have been successfully established there, as in 1644 it was described, in a minute by Mr. Garden, a member of the Government of the company, as 44 one of the most important centres of exchange which the company at that time enjoyed.' [163—1] ' BSubsequently trade seems to have fluctuated ^ Wet ' PP- 4 ' 6 considerably, and the factors do not seem to have , resided continuously at Bussorab. In writing his precis of the correspondence ot the years 1015 and 1661 Malet often refers to Bussorab, and he alludes to a correspondence between the joint factors there and the chief in council at Surat, and to British ships going to Bussorab. He frequently uses the expression ' Bussorah ships ' in such a way as to lead one to understand that their visits to that place were fairly regular ones. It may be of interest to note here, as indicating Malet, p. 8. the careless use of names, that in 1661, in a commission issued to the commander of the ' Amerira' or 'Amerita' by the governor in council, the port of Bussorah, oncol the poits to which she was ordered, is described as being ' within the Eiver Euphrates.' In 1661 and 1675 capitulations were granted by the Sultan to Great Britain, and in 1718' the Treaty of Passarovitz was concluded between Austria and Turkey. These will be noticed more fully in the section referring to treaties (Part II). In 1664, 1676, in the years 1683 to 1707, and PP* in subsequent years there are constant allusions to trade with Bussorah and Bussorah ships,' and in the diary of the Bombay Government of Malet, p. 14. the 6th April, 1724-, the following passage occurs in one of the resolutions recorded therein:— 'and first our settlement at Bussorah, where it is observed there is nothing vet done .... more O v than a promise obtained from the pasha that we shall pay but 3 per cent, on the broad cloth.' On the same date the diary records the Malet, p, 14. signature of a notification to be made at Bussorah, requiring all subjects of Great Britain trading under the Honourable Company's protec tion to be. conformable to the rules of the factory, and positively forbidding them to treat with the Government in any matters relating to their trade but through the factory. In 1727, owing to difficulties of trade, the Factory Recorda, agent withdrew from Bussorah, but the factory P * 22 ' was shortly afterwards re-established. In an extract from the same diary of the Malet, pp. 14 16th January, 1728, a reference is made to the and 15 ' Bussoiali letter of the 17th November, 1727, wherein Mr. French, the resident at Bussorah', describes a quarrel he had wijth the pasha, on the termination of which the latter expressedMalet, p. 15.

Aitchison, vol. xiii, p. 7. himself as inclined to encourasre the British o trade to the port of Bussorah. He then encloses an account of the ' consulage,' and refers to the arrival of the boats from Bagdad. Mr. French, on the 2nd March, 1728, reported, that the pasha was anxious to encourage the trade of our nation, and he enclosed a further account of the ' consulage ' collected at Bussorah. In the same year references occur for the first time in Malet's precis to the arrival of boats from Bagdad with freight for British vessels at Bussorah. Mr. French succeeded in obtaining in 1731 a firman from the Pasha of Bussorah, which restricted the import duty on British goods to 3 per cent. To obtain this, Mr. French was compelled to incur a certain amount of expense, which it was decided should be credited to the account of the ' consulage ' annually collected on behalf of the company. In order to reimburse itself, the company imposed an additional duty of 1 per cent, on all trade carried on by the English, whether by the company itself or by persons under its protection. During the years 1733-35, and again in 1742-44, a state of war existed between Turkey and Persia, which interfered with the trade of Bussorah. Matters quieted down, and trade seems to have been carried on as before, without the occurrence of any special incidents until 1750, when Mr. Shaw, the then resident at Bussorah, obtained a firman taking off the heavy charges for presents imposed upon all ships anchoring at Bussorah. In 1759 Solyman Pasha granted a firman, or &lt;£ booyooroldi,' in favour of Mr. Shaw, who was * then visiting Bagdad, enjoining obedience to the capitulations of the Porte regarding customs and all other things. In commenting on this, Mr. Shaw pointed out the advantages it would confer on British trade with Bagdad, in so far as it related to customs duties and dues on shipping. In 1760 the pasha attempted to impose a duty of 5 per cent, on European goods landed at Bussorali, but he was induced by Mr. Shaw to relinquish his demand. It was in 1763 that the Gombroon* factory was transferred to Bussorah. In 1764 the British Ambassador at Constanti nople obtained a berat constituting Mr. Kobert * /.e., Bunder Abbas.4 Garden and his successors in the agency as British consul at Bussorah; he was to take ' cognisance of all affairs concerning those of the nation to which he belongs, such as captains of ships, merchants, and also all who may he under the protection of the English flag Without his express written order no English vessel shall be permitted to come to Bussorah. About this time an arrangement was made by Malet, p. 47. the agent in council at Bussorah that a resident should reside at Bagdad ; this was approved by the Bombay Government on the 15tli January, 1766, and Mr. James Morley was appointed to the post, but he w T as recalled on the 2Srd November following. Between the years 1761 and 1769 the East India Maiet, pp. 38, 48, ^ find 54 Company's boats at Bussorah assisted the Pasha of Bagdad in his operations against the Arabs and others both above and below Bussorah. At this date (1769) the conduct of the Malet, p. 52, musaleem* was so unsatisfactory'that Mr. Moore, the agent at Bussorah, determined to have a personal interview with the pasha on the subject. Taking advantage of the departure of the pasha from Bagdad with a large force, he proceeded 300 iniles up the Euphrates with the cruiser u Expedition ' and the bomb ' Fancy ' to meet him at Um-el-abbas or Umlabass. There is no record in Malet of his having found it necessary to obtain a firman or any other authority for the purpose, nor of any objection being then raised to the presence of these vessels so far up the Euphrates. In 1773 the plague broke out at Bussorah, and Malet, p. 67. the resident was compelled with his staff to leave for India ; on his return in 1774 he brought with him two vessels, the ' Tigris ' and ' Euphrates,' for the use of the Turks. These vessels carried fourteen guns each, and were suitable for work on tte two rivers. The pasha, however, found himself unable to manage Malet d 57 hem, and said that he must rely on the British resident and his own musaleem to employ them m such a manner as they might think best for bis, the pasha's, interests. In 1775, during the Persian attack on Bussorah, Low's ' Hktorv of th r^ 1 0f the com P an y' s war-ships in th, r Indl ''' Nav y' the Shatt-el-Arab whieh assisted the Turks in '' P ' 166 ' the lr operations and ntiiis^ the two ^ had been supphed to the Turks. * The pasha's deputy or the governor.X MaJet, p. 61. Malet, p. 65. Factory Records, p. 22. Turkey Treaties, p. 487 Malet, p 70. Aitchison, vol. xiii, p. 10. Malet, p. 89. Owing to these troubles the company's agent withdrew from Bussorah and took the pasha's two vefcsels with him to save them from falling • &amp; into the hands of the Persians, but there is nothing in Malet to show what eventually became of them. In April 1776 Bussorah was surrendered to the Persians, and soon afterwards, on the invitation of the Persian commandef, the agent returned and reopened the factory. In 1778 the residency at Bussorah was made independent of that at Bushire, and about the end of the year Bussorah was regained by the Turks. The country remained in a very disturbed state, and Malet does not record any events of importance, for the present purpose, for some years. In 1783, owing to the necessity of transacting business with the pasha, the company appointed a native as agent at Bagdad. In this year a treaty of commerce was con cluded between Eussia and Turkey, which conferred on Russian subjects the right ' de naviguer librement dans tous ses El tats .... sur les mers, eaux et sur le Danube, et parlout ou la navigation et le commerce pourront convenir aux sujets russes.' In 1784 a Sened was issued by the Sultan which confirmed the Treaty of Passarovitz of 1718 and the rights of Austria to navigate the rivers, &amp;c., of Turkey. Owing to the obstruction of the Hiver Euphrates by the Ghessal Arabs in 1787 the Resident at Bussorah reported that the merchants were obliged to send their goods between Bussorah and Bagdad by the Tigris at great expense and with much loss of time. Mr. Harford Jones was appointed on the 5th July, i798, to be resident at the court of the Pasha of Bagdad,' for the purpose, amongst other things, of facilitating the transmission of news to and from India, and of watching the pro ceedings of Trench emissaries. On the 2nd November, 1802, the British Ambassador at Constantinople obtained the issue of an Imperial Ottoman diploma, or 'berat,' recognising Mr. Harford Jones as consul in the city of Bagdad. This was done in order to free him from the interruptions and intrigues to which be was exposed from not possessing such a sanction. [163—1] C6 The following extract from the berat explains bis position:— ' We have given him our Imperial berat that in conformity with the said capitulations the affairs of merchants and travellers under the protection of the British flag in this country .... should be referred to him, and that the departure of all vessels should take place only under his cognisance.' This indicates the use of British boats at Bagdad, though there is nothing, so far, to show that the English flag was used. British trade increased greatly in the year 1806, wherein Mr. Manesty, the resident at Bussorah, quoted the amount collected for consulage and customs for the period 1791 to 1806, and showed that a very large increase had taken place. ' q* mi. It was in this year that the residencies of ^!^P^ rd8 / Bussorah and Bagdad were placed under the p. 22. control of the Government of Bombay, and in August 1809 they were amalgamated, one resi dent being appointed for the two places. On the 29th January, 1808, the resident at Malet, p. 97. Bussorah forwarded the consular berat that had been issued in 1763 to Mr. Robert Garden, and stated that a few years before this it had been con firmed in his own name by the Sultan Selim on the application of the Earl of Elgin when Ambas sador at Constantinople. Owing to the disturbed condition of the country and the state of war, not many references to trade occur in Malet's precis at this time. The precis is taken up with descriptions of disturb ances and squabbles between the residents at Bussorah and Bagdad on the one part and the pasha on the other. On the 5th June, 1812, Mr. Rich, then in Malet, p. 107. charge of the residency at Bussorah, obtained a decree from the pasha for preventing the desertion of sailors from the East India Com pany 's cruisers and other vessels at Bussorah. On the 2»3rd September of the same year the Malet, p. 107. official title of the 'resident at Bussorah ' was changed by the East India Company to ' political agent in Turkish Arabia,' with the liberty to reside either at Bussorah or Bagdad, as occasion might require, and with authority to depute his assistant to either of those places.Mdet, p. 111. Malet, p. 117, Malet, p. li8. Aitchison, vol. xiii, p, 14. Malet, p. 128. On the 21st November, 1820, Captain Taylor, then assistant in charge of the Kesidency at Bussorah, reported that he had received an intimation from the political agent in Turkish Arabia that he believed that an attempt would be made at Bagdad to invade British rights, in the event of which he w r as to cause all com munication between the residency and the Bussorah Government to cease. This cessation w T as to ' extend in the strictest sense to all ships under British colours, whetfier helonying to the English or natives.' In consequence, shortly afterwards Captain Taylor withdrew his establish ment to Mohammerah. In the meantime the quarrel became so acute between the political agent at Bagdad and the pasha that the former was compelled to place the residency in a state of defence. In describing his preparations, he speaks of causing ' the yacht to be drawn up under the windows ' of the residency to prevent its being taken possession of by the Turks. After negotiations and his withdrawal from Bagdad and Bussorah the matter was settled, and Captain Taylor, who w T as then acting as political agent, Mr. Bich having died, returned to Bussorah on the 19th April, 1822. In a letter of the 29th March, 1823, the pasha stated that &lt;c the same duties shall be required of the English as were established throughout the w 7 hole of the Ottoman Empire, and prescribed by the treaty between our respective sovereigns,' and he agreed that ' no tax, except one previously well defined and arranged, should be levied on hoafs the property of British subjects and protege's, such, for instance, as pass behveen Bussorah and Bagdad,''' and that their boats should not be seized for the public service. This is a very important document, as it indicates that prior to 1823 British-owned boats did navigate the rivers between Bussorah and Bagdad. In 1831 the Pasha of Bagdad issued a booyoo- roldi to the authorities at Bussorah, In which he stated that he adhered to the ' stipulations and treaties which have been arranged and ratified with our exalted State,' and he ordered them to protect the rights and regard the just claims of the subjects of the Government (of the resident) arriving from Hindustan and their ships and merchants.• In 1832 the political agent went to resule Malet, p.

About this time the quesuou u. ^ che8ney'8 mnnieation with India was raised, and a disoussio NarratiTC , p. 4. arose as to the respective merits of the route by Egypt and of that hy the Euphrates. A parliamentary committee reported, am recommended that a grant should be made in order that the route viA the Orontes and the Euphrates should be'tried ; 20,000/. was granted, and Colonel Chesney was commissioned to com- mand the expedition.* In a letter written from the Foreign Office to the India Board the Duke of Wellington referred November 28, to Colonel Chesney's expedition, and described it ^ ^ as being for the promotion of the commerce and Narrative, p. 159. general interests of His Majesty's subjects. An application was accordingly made to the Porte for the necessary permission, and the of 1834; and prospective advantages to commerce were pointed ' S ' n ' 1 ' f 1 out to them. After a short delay a firman was issued on the 29th December, 1834, to the A P^ n dix III. various authorities on the Euphrates giving the ' a 1 ^ necessary authorization for two steamers to navigate by turns on the Kiver Euphrates, which flows at a small distance from the city of Bagdad, for the purpose of facilitating commerce. 44 This navigation is to continue as long as, conformably to what has been represented to us, it may prove useful to the two Powers and no inconvenience result therefrom.' This firman is the first express authority granted by the Central Government to the British Govern ment for the navigation of the Euphrates. It will be noticed that it contains no allusion to any treaty or other rights possessed, by Great- Britain, that permission was asked and granted, that it was to facilitate commerce, and that it was terminable if inconvenience was caused. On the 11th February, 1835, the Pasha of Bagdad issued a «booyooroldi' directing the local authorities on the Euphrates to assist the expedition which he stated was passing for pur poses of trade by permission of the Sublime Porte. 1 he pasha also expressed himself as favourable Colonel Taylor to to a scheme for the junction of the Orontes and ^[owT^ the Euphrates by a navigable canal, not ^ ' with theMalet, pp. 132- 133.

In spite, however, of this firman, the ' booyoo- roldi,' and letters, Colofiel Chesney met with much obstruction, which he eventually overcame. He left England with the two vessels, the 'Tigris' and 'Euphrates,' on tbe 10th Feb ruary, 1835, and on the 19th March, 1S36, he announced to the East India Company that the steamers were descending the great river, both vessels being completely armed and equipped. On the 21st May the ' Tigris ' was wrecked, and on the 18th June, 1836, Colonel Chesney arrived at Kurna, 43 miles above Bussorah, and was about to enter the Shatt-el-Arab, which he described as rather a branch of the sea than a river. The commercial character of the expedition was indicated in the above-quoted documents, and also by the fact that goods were supplied to the expedition, partly for presents to the Arabs, but principally to facilitate commercial dealings with them. It is also shown by a private letter to Consul Werry from Lieutenant Cleveland, Tv.N., of the ' Euphrates,' and also by Chesney's narrative (p. 24i), that the vessels did trade with the Arabs, though it is not said in W'hat the trading consisted, or whether it was merely a question of exchanging goods for provisions or for fuel for the steamers. On the 4th June, 1836, Colonel Taylor, the political agent in Turkish Arabia, residing at Bagdad, informed Colonel Chesney that the Pasha of Bagdad had sent ' booyooroldis' directing the Governor of Bussorah and the Sheikh of the Montefik Arabs to allot him a space at Kurna for his dep6t. In September 1836 the 'Euphrates' ascended the Tigris to Bagdad, and, later, the Elver Euphrates to the Lamlun marshes. Having attained its object the expedition was broken up in January 1837, and the surviving vessel, the ' Euphrates,' was handed over to the East India Company. In April of the same year Lieutenant Henry Blosse Lynch, an officer of the Indian Marine, was appointed to the command of the ' Euphrates,' and 'of any other vessels that may be employed on the Tigris or the Euphiates. He was instructed to establish such relations with the Arab tribes frequenting the rivers of Mesopotamia as might be serviceable to the [163—1] 1310 interests of Great Britain, and might add to the facilities for a speedy and -regular trans mission of mails between the Persian Gulf and the coast of Syria. He was also instructed to complete the surveys Malet, pp. 133, 1 rr* • 134. of the Eivers Euphrates and iigns. The bead-quarters of the 44 Euphrates ,, were at Bussorah, and she was employed in navigating and surveying the Tigris as well as the Euphrates without any objection being raised tbeieto, although the firman of 1831 only applied to the latter river. In 1837 and in 1838 she ascended Consul Werrj, the Tigris to Bagdad and Mosul, the Euphrates ^ y \ 0) 18 3 7 for about 500 miles as far as Hit, and she Low's« History of traversed the Saklawiya Canal connecting the ^ avy ' Tigris and Euphrates above Bagdad. In 1838 the East India Company, at the instance India Board to of Colonel Taylor, decided to send out three more leptember^fsss' steamers to the Mesopotamian rivers. The latter suggested the expediency of stationing two or three small steamers, well manned, armed, and equipped,' on the Euphrates and Tigris in aid of the general services expected of the larger vessel, the ' Euphrates.' The matter was regarded as secret, and no papers exist in the Foreign Office archives or can be found at the India Office to explain in more detail the reasons for dispatching these vessels, or whether any permission was obtained from the Turkish Government for stationing them in the rivers of Mesopotamia. But the fact remains that the steamers arrived in pieces, were reconstructed, and launched in 1810, and that they navigated Colonel Rose, and surveyed the rivers and regularly carried jutyu, i84i. mails up the Tigris without apparently any protest on the part of the Turkish Govern ment. At this time the flotilla consisted of four Secret Committee vessels, the 'Euphrates,' the ''Assyria,' the t0 the East India 4 Nimrod,' and the ' Nitocris,' and was under December 3, 1839. the command of Lieutenant Lynch, subject to the p. 134. orders of the political agent. On the 19th August, 1841 (Appendix IV), a firman was issued to the Pasha of Bagdad instructing him to assist Captain Lenj (Lynch) in the navigation of the Euphrates by two steamers under his command. The purport of this firman resembled that of the firman of 1834, and referred only to vessels belonging to the British Government on the Euphrates. This firman was not sent to the Eoreign Office11 Lord Ponsonby, No. 295, September 18, 1841. Malet, p. 134. Colonel Taylor to East India Company, No. 25, October 27, 1842. Colonel Taylor to Sir S. Canning, No. 14, October 14, 1842. at the time, and nothing was known of it until 1881, when it was referred to by Mr. Plowden in his memorandum of the 28th March, and again by Musurus Pasha in his interview at the Foreign Office on the 15th August, 1883. A copy of it was furnished by Musurus Pasha the 28th December, 1S83. In 1841 two of the steamers ascended the Euphrates, where they were detained by the fall of the river and w^ere unable to descend. In consequence a vizierial letter, dated the 16th September, 1841, was addressed to the Pasha of Aleppo giving permission for the crews to land and remain at Belis until the river became navigable. (Appendix V.} In the same year (1841) the Tigris, Euphrates, and other rivers, and some canals in Mesopotamia and in Persia, were ascended and surveyed, and these explorations were carried on by the flotilla until 1842, when three of them were withdrawn by the Indian Government for service on the Kiver Indus, the ' Nitocris ' alone being left in Mesopotamia. All this exploration of the rivers w r as carried out, it will be observed, without any protest from the Turkish Government; indeed, so far from protesting that Government gave permission by the vizierial letter of September 1841 for the crews to land and stay at Belis until the waters of the Euphrates had risen sufficiently to enable the steamers to descend, and in 1812 they availed themselves of the services of the tf&lt; Kitocris' in order to enable the Governor of Bussorah to reach his destination. In 1845 Major Bawlinson, who had a sltort time previously been appointed political agent in Turkish Arabia and consul at Bagdad, referred to the monthly trip of the 44 Nitocris ' to Bussorah. We now come to the events which led to the much discussed agreement of 1846. In 1842 and the following years the question of the duties levied in the Mesopotamian rivers became acute, and in order to make the matter clear it is desirable to refer very briefly to the earlier papers affecting these duties. By articles 57 and 58 of the English capitula tions it was settled that English merchants should pay a duty of 3 per cent, on goods imported by them from English or foreign ports; and by firmans and letters the Pashas of Bagdad applied these stipulations of the capitulations to12 Bussorah at -carious dates, viz., i' and 1823. In 1759 an attempt was made to increase these to 5 per cent., but it was not carried out owing to the resistance of the resident atCussorah ^ Bv the British treaty of Balta Liman o. . ■ , , rurkeVi pp 277( Great Britain consented to the imposition of an 278, and 279. import duty of 5 per cent, and an export duty of 12 per cent, in Turkey (article 4 and additional article 1, paragraph 3). In 1812 Messrs. Hector and Co., a British ^ b (J7 anmljg ' firm of Bagdad, complained to Her M^jest/s Mar £^ consul that thev had had to pay on a cargo ot goods, imported direct from England to Bussorah and Bagdad by water, duties to the amount of 1,192 piastres (equal to about 90/.), which duties were over and above the 3 per cent, and 2 per cent, sanctioned by the Treaty of Balta Liman (16th August, 1838). They contended that the exaction of such a sum was illegal and contraiy to the spirit and meaning of the treaty. In referring the matter to Her -Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople the consul at Bagdad observed that certain Arab sheikhs had been permitted for years by the Pasha of Bagdad to levy the dues in question in order to secure the laden vessels passing up and down the river from molestation and plunder by the Arabs under their control; and that they were chargeable directlv on the owners of the boats, and not on the freighters or merchants. He pointed out that in the present case Messrs. Hector and Co. had hired the boats of native owners, fully aware of the sums required by the Turkish Government from those parties, and that they had been demanded as usual of the native owners and captains, for whom Messrs. Hector and Co. had deemed it necessary to become responsible in paying the amounts. It seemed to Consul Taylor that the duties referred to in the commercial treaty related to those leviable directly on British goods on their importation and transmission to the interior, and that we were not authorised to interdict or evade the interior native duties on boats levied for purposes of protection. In repiving to Consul Taylor, Sir S. Canning To Lieutenant- said : — Colonel Taylor, No. 2, « t , . _ April 28, 1842 i cannot overlook the danger of admitting a (Enclosure in right to levy any kind of duty upon British May',' 1842V13 imported goods beyond those which are stipu lated in our commercial treaty. But it appears fioiTi youi statement (and there is nothing in the letter of Messrs. Hector and Co. to contradict it), that the additional charges they complain of are levied not upon the goods, but upon the boat; not upon the freighter, but upon the owner of the boat; that they are levied equally when the goods are native as when they are foreign, either in origin or in ownership ; and that the object of their imposition is to secure the goods from plunder on their passage up the river. If all this be so, and there is no reason to doubt it, m e are not only without just ground of com plaint, but we have a strong motive in policy tor not seeking to disturb the existing arrange ments. In order to avoid the payment of the contribution in question the British merchant must either deprive the Arab chiefs of their customary profit, or he must obtain an equivalent for them out of the import duties payable on his goods to the Turkish custom house. In the latter case the Porte would not obtain the amount of duty secured to her by the treaty. In the former the Arab chiefs w 7 ould be unable to restrain their tribes from plunder, and a loss far heavier than the amount paid to them would probably devolve upon the British merchant. It is therefore my opinion that resistance to the payment of these estab lished dues, besides being equivocal, in point of right, would probably be unsuccessful, and that even if it were to succeed, to say nothing of the injustice done thereby to the native merchant, a greater evil than the one avoided would be incurred.' In reporting the matter to Lord Aberdeen Sir S. Canning eaid that he understood from the consul that the addition of the charge in question to the 2 per cent, and 3 per cent, import duties w 7 ould not be more than the trade to Bagdad could reasonably bear. With the concurrence of the Board of Trade To Sir S. Canning-, Sir S. Canning was informed that he had taken No. 76, a correct view of the different points brought under his consideration by Consul Taylor with reference to the charge in question. In September 1845 Colonel Eawlinson reported that the question of the payment by British merchants of the ' qalibiyeh ' (' kalibiyeh ') [163—1] E July 4, 1842.14 tax had been raised by the authorit.es o£ Bagaad He stated that this duty had been imposed about twenty years earlier at Bagdad on the riyer craft in order to supply funds for the repair ot the bridges. Having been found profitable, it had been incorporated in the established sources oi revenue, but British subjects had not been required to pay it. He then proceeded to explain that the river boats belonging to British merchants at Bagdad were employed in two different species of traffic. During the favourable season they conveyed produce to Bussorah for exportation and returned with cargoes of British goods, while at other times they were made use of to supply the town with fire-wood, salt, and other articles of daily consumption which were found upon the banks of the Tigris. The kalibiyeh' duty, he said, was applied in different proportions to every trip which such boat might make; it was calculated in reterence to distance and tonnage, and might be assumed, therefore, to be levied on the cargo rather than on the vessel j and he pointed out that this tax differed in principle from the tax levied on boats ascending the river to secure immunity from Arab attacks, which has been referred to above. In writing on the 'kalibiyeh' duties Major MajorRawlinson, Eawlinson, in a later despatch, touched on November 25, the claim of the Turks to insist upon the 1845, Archives, vol 237 adoption of the Turkish flag, not only by British- (Appendix VIII). owned native boats,' but by vessels on the British register; and he said that he considered that the point appeared to be whether Bagdad could be considered as a port. He had, he added, on a previous occasion, referred the question to Consul- General Cartwright, who had clearly been of opinion that, if a vessel built and laden in India could enter the River Euphrates [? Shatt-el- Arab], pass Bussorah without breaking bulk or paying duty, and land her cargo at Bagdad, the latter place might be held to be the port of the Tigris, as Sook-es-Shukh might be considered the port of the iiiiphrates and Bussorah that of the united rivers. Major Rawlinson, however, admitted that there had been no instance of a vessel importing cargo direct from India to Bagdad, nor even of^a British ocean-going merchant-vessel appearing on the Tigris. He concluded his despatch by saying that, not only was the case ot the ' Kerbelai' in question,15 but tlmt several firms were engaged in preparing, more or less actively, iron steam-vessels for the navigation of the Tigris, the object being to supersede the present dilatory and uncertain method of bringing goods from Bussorah to Bagdad by sailing or tracking the river boats. Sir S. Canning reported early in 1846 that an attempt had been made by the Pasha of Bagdad to forbid the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates by British merchant-vessels other wise than under the flag of the country, and to levy duties upon them, hitherto confined to Ottoman subjects.' In consequence of the foregoing representa tions from Bagdad, and in order to regulate the questions raised by the pasha, Sir S. Canning felt that it was important to come to a direct understanding with the Porte before any new commercial enterprises had confirmed the jealousy which the pasha was ever ready to entertain. Por the purpose of effecting this, it was necessary, he considered, for him to consult the fair interests of the Porte, and not to leave room for any question as to the British 'doubtful right of conveying merchandise in our own vessels and under our jowu flag beyond the customary port of entry at Bussorah.' With this object in view. Sir S. Canning applied to the Ottoman Minister for the removal of those obstacles which Nejib Pasha had raised to the free navigation of British vessels on the waters under his jurisdiction, and, when diffi culties were made as to meeting the Ambas sador's wishes to their full extent, he proposed an arrangement, which, by means of some dis cussion between the interpreters and after much delay, aa as finally accepted and laid before the Sultan. So far, we have a statement of Sir S. Canning's objects in making the arrangement of 1846. The proposal which Sir S. Canning made is contained in a memorandum of the 5th Feb ruary, 1816, and agrees with the Turkish version, as expressed in the vizierial letter of the 2nd April, 1846, in substance and up to a certain point. This memorandum w r as not sent home until 1852, when Colonel Rose, then in charge of the embassy at Constantinople, forwarded it. It seems to have been overlooked both before and16 after 1852 in the negotiations, and only the su n maries (for Sir S. Canning gave two-one to L . Aberdeen and one to Major ^ quoted, both of which are misleading, tbou n different degrees. In view of its importance it is ad\ isa quote this memorandum, which is not a long one. Prefacing it is a etatement,* signed P. Pisani, to the effect that it had been translated from English into Turkish, and that, as no trace ot the' English was to be found, the following translation had been made from the Turkish sketch on the 2nd September. The use of the words ' Turkish sketch might he held to throw some doubt on the value of the paper, but an examination of the other docu ments will prove, I think, that it is in substance the original proposal made by Sir S. Canning, which formed the basis of the so-called agreement of 1846. The following is tho text of the memo randum :— 'Memorandum about the Navigation of Vessels and Caiks on the River of Tigris and the River of Euphrates, February 5, 1846.' '1. British vessels coming from sea and Appendix X (A), passing the straits to go back to sea, shall navi gate under their own flag; they shall pay 5 per cent, of custom duty for the goods they shall have imported, and 12 per cent, on goods they shall export from Turkey, and nothing else. ' 2. English vessels built in places under the British dominion, and having to stay, in order to navigate the two aforesaid rivers, shall navigate under their own flag; and, when busy in carrying from one place to another goods the produce of Turkey for their consumption in the country they shall pay the same duties as the vessels of the country. ,£ 3. Vessels and caiks built in the country and become the property of British merchants shall navigate under Ottoman flag, and pay the same duties which are paid by other vessels and caiks of the country.' This document appears to lay down— 1. That British merchant-vessels (presumably vessels with a British register) were entitled, Printed as a footnote in Appendix X (A).17 coming from and returning 1o the sea, to import and export goods, and, in doing so, to navigate under the the British flag the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, no geographical limit being mentioned, ihey were only to pay the duties imposed by the Treaty of 33alta Liman, that is, 5 per cent, on imports and 12 per cent, on exports ; 2. That British-built vessels might take part in the internal traffic of the two rivers under the Biiiish flag, but that they must pay the same duties as craft built and owned by natives ; and 3. That vessels and caiks built in the country (and therefore without a British registry), but owned by British merchants, might carry on internal traffic on the rivers, but must do so under the Ottoman flag and must pay the same duties as natives similarly engaged. The next document to be examined is a report from le Grand Douanier to Bechid Pasha on Sir S. Canning's memorandum, dated the 24th [February, which was communicated by Bechid Pasha, the Grand Vizier, to Sir S. Canning on the 26th Eebruary, 1846, but not sent home. This, too, seems to have been overlooked. In it he gives the substance of the memoran dum, which agrees with the terms of the copy sent home by Colonel Bose in 1852, except that in paragraph 2, instead of using words equivalent to 'carrying from one place to another goods the produce of Turkey for their consumption in Turkey,' he merely uses the words ' en trans- portant des marchandises.' Apparently, how ever, he considered this as representing the terms of the memorandum, because he concludes the paragraph by saying: c&lt; Voila ce que dit le memorandum.' After recapitulating and explaining the terms of the memorandum, the Grand Douanier con cludes his report by saying that ' les navires qui naviguent dans les deux fleuves et dans les environs,' ought to pay the same anchorage dues as ' les batiments ' visiting Turkish ports. In this report the words 'batiments,' 'na vires ' and ' bateaux ' appear to be used more or less indiscriminately. This report proves the authenticity and cor rectness of the copy of the memorandum sent home by Colonel Bose. We now come to the vizierial letter of the 2nd April, 1846, addressed to the Pasha of [163—1] . F18 Bagdad. It is an answer to a letto^ latter relating to the duties pan y meats et les barques qui navigaent sur Tiere et I'Euplirate.' , , ». It also mentions the Ambassadors actu or memorandum, of which bespeaks as referring to ' les hatiments anglais.' It then gives ie substance of a report from the superintendent of the ' H6tel des Monnaies,' which contains a definition of internal river traffic, and stales that under whatever flag ' les navires ct les barques' may carry it on they must pay the same duties as those paid by Ottoman subjects. The next sentence is obscure in its language, but it no doubt is intended to mean that Uritish vessels (' batiments') importing goods under their own flag from abroad into the two rivers, or exporting Turkish goods therefrom, are to pay the duties fixed by the treaty and tariff, and also to pay an anchorage dufey of 5 piastres. This concludes the quotation of the report from the ' H6tel des Monnaies. The Grand Tizier then goes on to say that the British Ambassador has given his adhesion to the above report; that it has been submitted to the Sultan, who has directed that all necessary steps should be taken in the matter. He then directs the pasha to take from the ' barques de commerce anglaises,' which shall be engaged in the internal commerce of the two rivers, the same dues as are levied on the ' barques des sujets ottomans,' and to levy on the ~' chargements des Mtiments anglais' engaged in the foreign trade only the duly established customs duties and an anchorage duty of 5 piastres. It should be noted that the superintendent of the 'H6tel des Monnaies,' in his report as quoted, speaks of 'les navires et les barques' as being engaged in the internal trade, and of ' les batiments ' as being engaged in the external or foreign trade; and the Vizier, in his instructions to the pasha, speaks of the ' barques ' only as being engaged in the internal trade, and the batiments' only as being engaged in the foreign trade, apparently with the intention of making a distinction in the treatment of the two ditferent classes of vessels. The next document to be considered is Sir S. Canning's No. 45 to Lord Aberdeen of the 18th March, 1846. In this he gave a version of the agreement which he had made, and which con-19 tamed the following stipulations: 'Britishvessels, qualified to act as such, will be allowed to pass up and down the rivers without obstruction under their own flag, paying for the merchandise on hoard according to the Treaty of Balta Liman, and staying to carry on the internal traffic at their pleasure.' The purport of the words in italics in the above sentence differs from that of the memorandum and of the vizierial letter, inasmuch as no men tion is made in it of the condition that British vessels engaged in the internal trade should pay the same duties as those paid by natives engaged in the same traffic. With this important exception the above version does not differ from the memorandum, as far as it goes, nor from the report of the Grand Douanier, nor from the vizierial letter. In the version Sir S. Canning sent to Major Rawlinson, paragraph 2 agrees substantially with the first sentence of the version above quoted in the despatch to Lord Aberdeen, and the same omission occurs in it as to the payment, by British- owned vessels engaged in the internal traffic, of the same duties as those paid by natives. In paragraph 3 he says : &lt;£ In the event of their being employed above the usual ports of entry in the internal traffic of the country, they will be liable to the anchorage duty which is always paid here, and which is sanctioned by the capitu lations.' The condition in this paragraph, that British ships taking part in the internal traffic should only pay the anchorage dues when engaged above the usual ports of entry, does not appear in the earlier documents on the subject above referred to. Paragraph 4 is explanatory, and need not be further referred to. The first part of paragraph 5 relates to dues levied on, and the flag carried by, native-built craft owned by British subjects, and agrees with the other documents. The second part is explanatory, and refers to vessels which have wrongly used the British flag. The sixth paragraph, which is also explanatory, is important, as showing that in Sir S. Canning's opinion the only limitation on the navigation of the Mesopotamian rivers by British vessels was the insufficiency of water, a limitation which it may be observed would vary according to the season and other natural causes.20 It is not necessary to discuss the remaining Pa Oa § ?lSth April Sir S. Canning was informed To Sir S. Canning that Her Majesty's Government entirely approved Apr „ 6 , me. the'manner in which he had dealt with this ^ThTvizierial letter was sent to Major Eawlinson on the 4th April, i 816 ; ,,nJ received at the Foreign Office on the .6th Apu . The probable explanation of the disciepancies ahove noted is that, as he himself stated, Sir S Canning did not receive the vizienal letter until after he had written his despatches to Lord Aberdeen and Colonel Kawlinson, and that there fore those despatches were written partly from memory and partly from the earlier documents and notes, &amp;c., which are not forthcoming now, of verbal communications made by the dragomans to the Porte. It does not seem possible, therefore, to lay any stress on Sir S. Canning's version, hut if we appeal to the agreement of 1846 at all, we must base our claim, I think, on the terms of 1. The memorandum from the embassy of the 5th February, 1846 ; 2. The Rapport du Grand Douanier of the 24th Eebruary, 1846; and 3. The vizierial letter of the 2nd April, 38t6. Sir S. Canning's statements may be useful in sir S. Canning, • No 94 the explanation of doubtful points. j u ^ e ^ 1 g 46 In June 1846, in forwarding M ajor Bawlinson's (Appendix XII&gt; despatch regarding the arrangement, Sir S. Canning described it as being 'for the more regular enjoyment by British vessels of the internal navi gation of the rivers in that province' (of Bagdad). Major Bawlinson's appreciation was expressed in the following terms: ' The formal acknow ledgment which your Excellency has succeeded in obtaining of our right to navigate these rivers •under our own flag, and subject to no other charge than a fee for anchorage, which is so low as to be merely nominal, cannot but be con sidered a concession of the very highest conse quence'; so that now, after the receipt of the vizierial letter, both Sir S. Canning and Major Bawlinson overlooked the stipulation as to the payment of duties on a native footing by British vessels engaged in the internal traffic. 1 he latter, however, seems to have developed doubts on the subject subsequently (see IS52) ;21 Appendix XI, No. 2. Appendix XI, Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Appendix X (C). Major Rawlinson,- No. 16, April 1, 1846 (Archives). Major Rawlingon, No. 7, October 27, 1846. To Board of Control, December 17, 1846. To Major Kawlinson, No. 5, June 8,1847. Major Rawlinson, No. 12, March 16, 1849, Archives, vol. 334. but in September 1846 Major Eawlinson sent a circular to the British merchants of Bagdad embodying the first five paragraphs of Sir S. Canning's despatch to him of the 25th March, 1816, with a copy of the vizierial letter of the' 2nd April, 1846. Early in 1846, by Major Rawliuson's direc tions, the 'Nitocris' made an unsuccessful attempt to ascend the Tigris to Mosul. In his instructions to the commander on this occasion, Major Rawlinson laid stress on the political importance of ascending the Tigris, in order to preserve the right which had been granted by special firman to British war vessels. He stated that this was also the object of the monthly trip of the ' Nitocris ' to Bussorah. He did not, however, specify the firman, presum ably he referred to that of 1834. He had the same object in view when in 1845 he wrote to the Board of Control with regard to the contemplated withdrawal, on account of their cost, of the armed steamers from the Mesopotamian rivers. He then pointed out the great political and commercial advantages which we gained from the presence of a war vessel on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and the difficulty we should have in recoverin 0, this right of navigation should it be abandoned. ITe had referred to the above correspondence, because in 1846 the question of the withdrawal of the ' Nitocris' was again raised on the occasion of her being sent to Bombay for repairs. In consequence of the above despatch, Lord Palmerston made a strong representation to the Board of Control, and the 44 Nitocris ' was allowed to return to the Mesopotamian rivers. It may be noticed that enclosed in Major Rawlinson's despatch No. 7 quoted above is a letter from the British merchants at Bagdad, in which attention was called to the fact that the river craft afforded the only means of conveyance between Bagdad and Bussorah, and they spoke of the protection afforded them by the presence of the war steamers on the rivers. In 1848 a claim was put forward by the Bagdad authorities for the payment by Messrs. Lynch and Co. of ' galibiyeh ' duties for one of their boats on the Tigris. The matter became the subject of a suit in one of the local courts, [163 — 1] Gagainst which Messrs. Lynch appealed, and which was referred to the embassv. „ ,, The question is of no importance as far as present memorandum is concerned and is only noticed because reference was matle to ' Canning's version of the arrangement ol If t.i, whereby the right of the Turkish Government to levy duties on native-built boats owne 0 British subjects and engaged in the interna traffic was recognised, and because Major llaw m- son on this occasion sent to Sir S. Canning bis circular of 1846 to the merchants of Bagdad regarding Sir S. Canning's arrangement of that year (see Appendix XI, No. 2). In 1848 disputes arose as to the payment ot duties on account of goods descending the Tigris from Mosul on rafts, and in 1850 reference was made to the navigation of the Zab, an affluent of the Tigris, by Messrs. Hector's rafts, which show that British trade was carried on by river above Bagdad. In 1851 Captain Kemball, who was acting Captain Kemball , , , , . f- • t-, t to Sir S. Canning, consul-general at Bagdad during Major kawiin- ^ U g US t 13,1851, son 's absence, was asked by Messrs. Hector Archives, vol. 367. and Co. whether an iron vessel, built in England, brought out in pieces, and put together at Bussorah or Mohammerah, would, if ' employed in the internal trade or from seaward,' be exempt from the river taxes levied by the Arab tribes on native boats. Captain Kemball, in his reply, called Messrs. Hector and Co.'s attention to the terms of Sir S. Canning's despatch of the 25th March, 1846, and to the vizierial letter of that year, and said that when engaged in the internal traffic British vessels would have to pay ' the same duties that are paid in similar circumstances by the most- favoured class of Turkish subjects engaged in the internal trade.' In saying this he seems to have taken a view differing from that expressed in Sir S. Canning's despatches of the 18th and 25th March, 1846 (Appendices IX and XI), that such vessels should not pay the same duties as native vessels. In the next year Messrs. Hector and Co. again Major Rawlinson reierred to the question of placing a British- to Sir ^ t!aIlnin ff built iron steamer and cargo boat on the Mesopo- fs^Archiv^ 7 tamian rivers. It was intended that they should vo1 - 367 - be used for carrying and towing goods from essrs. Hector and Co.'s sea-going vessels in the ussorah roads to their warehouses in Bagdad.23 Under these circumstances they were anxious to know what their liabilities would be in regard to the transit duties levied on boats engaged in the internal traffic. They pointed out the inutility of the vizierial letter of 1846, owing to the fact that no really sea-going vessel could navigate the Tigris and Euphrates, NoTos 1 ,October 1; Colonel Eose obtained a vizierial letter to the No. 158, ' Pasha of Bagdad putting a stop to the abuse of December 7, 1852 i • mi i j .i i , (Appendix XIII). lev ying illegal transit duties and tolls on British goods between Bussorah and Bagdad, irrespec tively of the mode of conveyance, and directing that arrangements as to freights should be made. He was disinclined to press a claim as to English steam navigation on the Mesopotamian rivers, as by doing so he might interfere with various other schemes, and the matter seems to have been dropped. One of the schemes referred to was for the establishment *of communication between Con stantinople, Bagdad, and Bussorah, partly by rail way and partly by steamers on the Mesopotamian rivers, and it was probably in connection with Colonel Rawlinson, this that early in 1852, as Colonel Rawlinson No. i2 FeblUa0 11; reported, the Governor of Bussorah announced Februarr 2§, that he intended to establish Turkish steamers on 1852, Archives, . . _ _ _ t vol. 367. the rivers, and proposed that Lieutenant Lynch should be placed in command of them. Colonel llawlinson was, however, quite opposed to giving any assistance to the Turks in the matter, as success in this project would have made them much more difficult to deal with. Two boats were eventually purchased in Bel gium, and one of them commenced to ply between Bussorah and Bagdad in April 1859. Lord Stratford de In 1852 the British merchants at Bagdad May 28, 1853 ' requested that the armed steamer belonging to the East India Company should be used to pro tect their merchandise and vessels on the Tigris against the Arabs, and to extract compensation from them. This request was referred by Colonel Eawlinson to the Government of India, who replied that their object was to cultivate friendly relations with the Turkish Government and the Arabs; but they added that the steamer should not be employed in hostilities, even at the request of the Turkish Government, except under very exceptional circumstances. Lord Stratford de Bedcliffe in writing toIP! oa m 24 Colonel llawlinson said that the question appeared to be decided by the instructions of the East India Company, but be trusted that should the merchants, in case of necessity, appeal foi the assistance of the war steamer, such an appeal would not bo made in 'v ain. The Ambassador's action in this matter was approved. In 1856 Captain Kemball addressed a remon strance to Reshid, the Pasha of Bagdad, on the subject of the illegal increase in the transit dues levied on the boats of British merchants pl\ ing the Tigris between Bussorah and Bagdad. In his reply the pasha maintained that the dues question had been correctly levied, quoting the views of native merchants whom he bad consulted. In the course of his reply he stated that he was not aware that British merchants could possess boats on the river. Captain Kemball in protesting against this reply argued that the British trade to Bagdad was not internal trade, and should, therefore, be exempt from the dues levied on natives engaged in the internal traffic. The reason be gave for the non-inclusion of British trade in the internal traffic was that the goods were brought direct from abroad in British vessels to Bussorah where they were transhipped into river craft without being landed. Captain Kemball, at the same time, sent the vizierial letter of 1846 to the pasha, which appears to have convinced him as to the right of British merchants to possess boats on the liver, but did not induce him to change his views regarding the alleged excessive exaction of dues. In Pebruary 1860 Messrs. Stephen Lynch and Co. stated that they had received an order from their house at Bagdad to purchase a steamer to trade between Mohammerah, Bussorah, and Bag dad, and enquired if an English company had a right to navigate the rivers between those places. The question was referred to the librarian of the Foreign Office, who drew up a memorandum setting forth the arrangement agreed upon by ir S. Canning and the Porte in 1816 for the navigation by merchant vessels of the Tigris and uphrates ; and, in reply to their enquiry, Messrs Lynch were informed of the substance of this arrangement. Their firm at Bagdad, however received a letter from the acting consul -general To Lord Stratford de Kedcliffe, No. 90. June 22, 1853. Captain Kemball, No. 20, August 20, 1856, Archives, vol. 521.

Canning, could not be considered as conferring any permanent right, but was regarded by the Ambassador at Constantinople (Sir' H. Bulwer) as a document merely giving a temporary permission which might be revoked at any time by another document of a similar character. It further appeared from this letter that Sir H. Eulwer did not consider it to be safe for Messrs. Lynch to engage capital in the navigation of the Mesopotamian rivers until they had obtained special sanction from the Porte. As regards this sanction the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir II. Eulwer that, if a firman of concession were applied for, the Porte would probably agree to an arrangement for the estab lishment by Messrs. Lynch of a line of steamers to run between Eussorah, and Bagdad. s. 1^ nch were informed, in reference to the foregoing, that there was nothing in the Foreign Office to show that the arrangement of 1846, or the vizierial instructions concerning it, bore the limited construction indicated in Actino- Consul-General Hyslop's letter. Messrs. Lynch feared that the local authorities would oppose the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates by their steamers, and in the course of an interview with Colonel Kemball, consul- general at Bagdad, were recommended by him to apply for the special sanction of the Porte. In reference to the steamers which Messrs. Lynch proposed to send out from England in pieces and to put together at Bussorah, Colonel Kemball raised the question whether they could rightly be regarded as British vessels. This question was submitted to the Law Officers, who reported that a steam vessel having been built and registered in England and afterwards carried out to Eussorah in pieces and reconstructed there would be rightly held to be a bond fide British ship. In addition to Messrs. Lynch s letter (the 12th November) relative to their interview with Colonel Kemball, the previous correspondence with the firm (February and June) and the library memorandum of the 14th February were communicated to the Law Officers, but they stated in the final paragraph -of the report referred to above that ' whether British ships have a right to navigate the Tigris is a matter on which we have no means of forming an opinion.' [163—1] II .[J 26 \ ; Copies of the correspondence with Messrs. Lynch (including a letter of the 24th hovember, to the firm giving the substance o ie J Officers' report, and a copy of the library memo random of the Uth February) were sent to Sir H. Bulwer, and he was informed that iUs Maiestv's Government did not doubt that the arrangement of 1846 would be faithfully adhered to by the Turkish Government, nor did they share Messrs. Lynclis apprehension as to the action of the local authorities, and, therefore, did not consider it requisite to give specitic instruc tions on the matter. At the same time, he was told that he was at liberty to apply to the Porte to grant some further security for Messrs. Lynch, if circumstances had arisen since the conclusion of the arrangement of 1S46 leading him to con sider it necessary to obtain it. Somewhat later Messrs. Lynch stated that they had formed a company to carry out their proposed scheme, and that the requisite funds had been subscribed, and they enquired if they could consider themselves at liberty to commence the construction of steamers for navigation of the Tigris, or whether they should await the issue of a special firman by the Porte authorising their undertaking. In the latter case, they desired that Sir H. Bulwer should be instructed to support their application and to act directly in the matter. Messrs. Lynch's letter was com municated to Sir H. Bulwer, but the Foreign Office, in replying to the firm, declined to express any opinion for their guidance as to the matters referred to by them. Sir H. Bulwer, who earlier in the month had reported that he was engaged in settling the matter satisfactorily with the Porte, forwarded on the 18th January, 1861 (with reference to Foreign Office despatch No. 663 of the 27th November of the previous year) a vizierial letter addressed to the Pasha of Bagdad, which he described as confirmatory of the arrangement of 1846. This vizierial letter was dated the 15th January, 1861. The first part was thus worded ' The British Embassy having recently made certain communications lor the purpose of obtaining a renewal of the orders which were sent concerning the British steamers and boats authorised by His Majesty to ply on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, it has appeared from the register that permission having on a former occasion been applied for by it to station two steamers To Sir H.

The latter part recited the substance of the arrangement of 1846, and the Pasha of Bagdad was instructed in the final paragraph of the letter to ' act according to the above rules.' No account of the negotiations leading up to the issue of the vizierial letter appears to have been given to the Foreign Office by Sir H. Bulwer, nor did he comment on its terms, beyond stating that it was confirmatory of the arrangement of 1846. Nothing has been found in the correspondence at the time to show that it was to be understood that the firmans of 1834 and 1841 were mentioned in order to restrict Messrs. Lynch's company to the employment of two vessels only. Messrs. Lynch were furnished with a transla tion of the vizierial letter, and a few months later the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company (Mr. H. B. Lynch, chairman) reported that they bad been duly constituted and registered for the purpose of navigating the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris by steam-vessels, and that their first steamer was about to be dis patched to Bussorah to ply on those rivers. Instructions were thereupon sent to Sir H. Bulwer and to the consul-general at Bagdad to give such countenance and protection to the interests of the company as they could properly afford. It appears from a despatch sent to the Ambassador at Constantinople by the consul- general at Bagdad in 1881, that the steamer ' City of London' was sent out in pieces and was completed and placed on the Tigris in May 1862, but that it was then found neces sary to obtain the issue of a fresh vizierial letter^ addressed to the Vali of Bagdad, Namick • Bagdad is on the Tigris. f No information on the subject was furnished to the Foreign Office at the time by the Embassy at Constantinople, the Consul-General at Bagdad, or the Euphrates and Tigris- Steam Navigation Company.28 Pasha, in view of his opposition to the navigation of the Mesopotamia,! rivers hy vessels sadmg ■under a foreign flag and register. this v mem letter, dated the 2nd July. 1862, was idenhcal m terms with the earlier letter of the loth Januarv, 1861, and was described by the Ambassador at Constantinople as 'repeating the directions already given to bis Excellency (tao \.i i) throw no obstacles in the way of British steamers navigating the Tigris and Euphrates.' . . w Two years later the Euphrates and Tigris Euphra^and Steam Navigation Company, who had been Navigation granted a subvention by the Indian Government 51^27^1864. for the carriage of mails, proposed to employ a second steamer on the Tigris, but met with opposition from Namick Pasha on the ground that further permission from the Porte was necessary before they could do so. Ihe vali contended that the vizierial letter of the 15th January, 1861, alluded to the employment ot two vessels only, and this number was complete as the ' Comet' and 41 City of London ' were then on the river. The company asked that the matter should he referred to the Ambassador at Constantinople in order to prevent any difficulty being made in regard to the employment on the Tigris and Euphrates of another vessel, or several others when required by their service. Sir H. Bulwer was directed to apply to the To Sir LL Bulwer, Porte to instruct the Pasha not to put any im- j une 2,1864. pediment in the way of the company placing a second steamer on those rivers, and a note Mr. Stuart (dated the 1st October, 1864) was received from the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs grant- October 10, 1864. ing permission for a new steamer to navigate the Tigris in the place of the ' Comet,' ' un des deux bateaux sous pavilion anglais qui ont Tautorisation de naviguer sur ledit flcuve.'* The note proceeded;— ' Vous savez, M. le charge d'affaires, que I'autorisa- tion accprdee k cet effet comporte, outre la reserve stipuMe pour le cas ou des inconv^nients locaux seraient signales dans sa mise a execution, la condition expresse que le nombre des bateanx k vapeur destines k cette navigation sera d^fmitivement fix6 k deux.

Enclosure in Mr. Stuart, No. 115, November 28, 1864. Sir H. Bulwer, No. 6, March 14, 1864. A copy of the Porte's note was communicated to Colonel Keraball, consul-general at Bagdad, who reported that, ' presuming the resolution of the Porte restricting to two the number of river steamers of whatever denomination bearing the English flag which may be permitted to navi gate the rivers of Mesopotamia has been admitted by His Majesty's Government,' lie would communicate with the Government of Bombay to arrange for the withdrawal of the ' Comet' and of the ' Satellite,' which had. been sent to Bussorah to relieve the ' Comet.' He pointed out, however, that the Porte's assumption that the company's new steamer (the ' Dijleh') was intended to replace the ' Comet' was erroneous,* and the charge d'affaires at Constantinople thereupon obtained permission from the Porte for the provisional retention of the latter vessel for the transport of materials, &amp;c., until the completion of Ihe line of telegraph between Bagdad and Fao. Mr. Stuart did not explain why it bad been assumed by the Embassy that the new vessel which the company wished to send out was intended to replace the ' Comet/' but it appears that earlier in the year (1864) Namick Pasha on behalf of the Turkish Government offered to purchase the steamer, which had been condemned as unserviceable, with the intention of maintain ing it as an armed vessel. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company were appa rently trying to secure the vessel by private purchase in order to prevent it being brought into competition with their own steamers,f but Colonel Kemball thought they would not object to the vessel falling into the hands of the Turkish authorities, and suggested that it should be * The Embassy seem to have been responsible for the misapprehension. f Colonel Kemball remarked later that, ' as under existing- restriction the company could not possess a third vessel,' they would only purchase the .vessel to break it up.

Trench Government applied for permission on the same terms for two French steamers to ply on the Tigris. Hereupon Mr. Stuart, charge Mr. Stuart, d'affaires at Constantinople, discussed with the November 29, Porte the advisability of opening the Tigris and Euphrates to the commerce of all nations. His despatch reporting on the question concluded with the remark that, ' so long as Great Britain and France were respectively restricted to the employment of two ships upon the iigiis and Euphrates, the position of the two nations was exactly equal—a position very disproportionate to their relative interests in that quarter of the globe, if, however, the restrictions could be removed, the concession would be nominally equal, whilst the material result would be to give to Great Britain the position of commercial superiority which should properly belong to her.' His action was approved, and he was To Mr. Stuart, instructed to continue to urge the matter further ^elnber 12,' upon the consideration of the Ottoman Govern- 1864. ment. With reference to the Porte's note of the To Mr. Stuart, 1st October, giving permission for the company's November, 30, new steamer to navigate the Tigris, and calling 1864 ' attention to the fact that ' the original conces sion granted by the Turkish Government in 1846 ' * limited the number of British vessels to be employed to two, Mr. Stuart was informed that no mention was made in the arrangement of 1846 of the number of British vessels which were to be allowed to navigate the rivers of Mesopotamia. It was further pointed out to him that the vizierial letter of January 1861, purporting to be confirmatory of the arrangement of 1846, gave permission for two steamers to be stationed on the Euphrates, but did not mention that the number was to be limited ; and he was instructed to report whether the original agreement or any • The original concession referred to in the Porte's note was evidently granted by the firmans of 1834 and 1841, and not the arrangement of 1846.31 subsequent written agreement could be construed as bearing out the contention of the Porte that the vessels to be employed were restricted to two or any other specified number. No 162^' ^ r ' ^ tuart re pli e( i that there was no trace m December 21, the embassy archives of any written agreement having been signed by Sir S. Canning with the Porte in 1816, but that there was a translation of a letter from the Grand Vizier to the Pasha of Bagdad giving the substance of the agreement^' come to, which contained no mention of the number of British ships to be allowed to navigate the rivers. He remarked that, although the firman of 1831 limited the number of British ships to be employed on the Euphrates to two, there was no sign of the limitation having been renewed in 1846, nor could he find any other foundation for the Porte's assertion that the number of vessels so to be employed had been restricted. No instructions to combat the Porte's conten tion as to the limitation to two of the number of steamers to be employed upon the Mesopotamian rivers appear to have been given in reply to this Enclosure in despatch, and Mr. Plowden, writing in 1881, Plowden's^a 2 remarked that the persistency with which the Commercial, Turkish authorities in 1864 reiterated the state- March 28, 1881. , ,, , , • j .- n i ment that under existing nrmans only tvro British steamers were permitted to navigate the Tigris apparently ended in securing its undisputed acceptance. Enclosure in addition to the ' Comet ' there was at this Lord Lyons's time on the Tigris the other Government steamer, No 36 November 22, the ' Satellite,' which had been sent to relieve 1865, the 'Comet.' The 'Satellite' was originally brought to Turkish Arabia by Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart w r ith vessels engaged in laying the cable, and retained for purposes connected with the jnaintenance of the Mesopotamian line of tele graphs. The company's steamer ' City of London' becoming temporarily disabled in February 1865, Namick Pasha refused to allow the ' Satellite ' to be employed in place of the disabled steamer for the carriage of mails, and Mr. Stuart was instructed to urge the Porte to issue positive orders to the Pasha not to interfere * Copies of the memorandum communicated by Sir S. Canning to the Porte, the report by the Ottoman Grand Douanier, and the vizierial letter of April 2, 1846, which may be regarded as constituting the agreement of 1846, are printed in Appendix X.32 with the employment of the vessel hy company. As a result of Mr. Stuart's represen- To Mr- , tations, permission for the 'Satellite' to carry February 23,1865. the mails was telegraphed to Namick Pasha hy the Porto, but the Turkish Minister for Foreign March 2, 1865. Affairs, Aali Pasha, remarked that the naviga tion of Ottoman rivers by foreign men-of-war could not be claimed as a right, but only as an exception, as in that particular instance. Namick Pasha's interference with the employ ment of the ' Satellite ' in carrying mails when the ' City of London' broke down induced Appendix XV. J (Enclosure in) Mr. Stuart to submit a memorandum to the Mr. Stuart's Porte reminding them of the agreement made 1865 ^ between the Ottoman Government and Lord Ponsonby in 1834, giving permission for two British steamers to be employed on the Euphrates (by virtue of which agreement the 'Comet' and 'Satellite' were employed), and of the arrangement made between the Porte and Sir S. Canning in 1846, throwing open the Meso- potamian rivers to British shipping for trade and commerce, without exclusion of steamers and with out restriction as to numbers. It was stated in the memorandum that when ' application was made to the Porte in 186i for permission for the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany to place two steamers upon the rivers, the Porte answered that the number of British steamers admitted must be restricted to two, and that permission for the two new ones could only be granted upon the understanding that upon their arrival the old ones would be withdrawn.' It was pointed out that the 'Comet' and ' Satellite ' had been of great use to the Otto man Go\ernment at various times, and had per formed good service in connection with the Indo- European telegraph, and that the British Government would look upon their removal as an act of great .discourtesy, particularly at a time when Namick Pasha was apparently encouraging the formation of a French steam- packet company in the same waters. In conclu sion it was suggested that the opportunity should be taken to throw open the Mesopotamian rivers to the commercial flags of all nations, thus givin- to foreign nations their legitimate share of com merce in those waters, besides probably proving to Turkey a source of immense wealth and pros- penty by promoting the rapid development of the resources of that fertile portion of the Empire,Mr. Stuart, No 123, March 14, 1865.

Mr. Stuart, No. 202, April 11, 1865. 33 la his despatch transmitting the memo randum referred to above, Mr. Stuart remarked that he had frequently spoken to Aali Pasha respecting the importance of opening the Meso- potamian rivers to the commercial flags of all nations. As regards the ' Comet' and ' Satellite,' Aali Pasha laid stress on the fact that they were not merchant-ships, but more or less ships of war, inasmuch as they belonged to Her Majesty's Government, and he maintained that, although the rivers might be open to merchant- vessels, the Porte could not be expected to admit the ships of foreign Governments into the inland waters of Turkey. Mr. Stuart considered that this plea was reasonable, and thought that the advocacy of a contrary principle might encourage dangerous demands from other quarters. He held it to be more prudent to endeavour to obtain permission for the vessels to remain on the rivers upon the same footing as formerly, until it suited Her Majesty's Government to remove one or both of them, rather than to raise the question of their right to be there as ships belonging to Her Majesty. Approval of the course taken by Mr. Stuart was conveyed to him. He had mentioned in his despatch that regulations were being prepared by the Porte for the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, which Aali Pasha trusted would be found satisfactory by Her Majesty's Govern ment, and he was instructed to express the hope of the British Government that the arrangements under consideration would result in throwing open the rivers generally to the merchant-ships of all nations. He was also told to protest against the unfriendly course taken by Namick Pasha in questions in which British interests were concerned. According to Aali Pasha, Namick Pasha's jealousy was not confined to English, but also extended to foreign, interests ; and although supposed to have encouraged the establishment of a French steam-packet company in Mesopotamia he was really opposed to the admission of the French company, and had urged the Porte to prevent its formation. Mr. Stuart communicated the Foreign Office despatch (No. 119, 30th March, 1865), con-* veying the instructions mentioned above, to the Porte without observation, leaving it to produce its own effect. In regard to Namick [163—1] K34 Pasha,* however, it seems that . r. , ' J1 . previousiv taken occasion to suggest o . a Pasha the removal of that governor from Bagdad to another pashalic. The effect ot M.. Stuarts communication was not apparent; .Vumck Pasha remained at Bagdad, and the question o opening the rivers of Mesopotamia to ^cnu.i navigation remained in abeyancx, althou^ii when receiving the Foreign Office despatch Aali Pasha referred to the new regulations for the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, and observed that the draft of them required altera tion before it could be communicated to Mr. Stuart. Seemingly it never was communicated to him, and Lord Lyons, writing to Colonel Enclosure iu Kemball later in the year (3rd November, 1865), remarked that he was still awaiting the final November 22, decision of the Porte on the question of throwing open the Mesopotamian rivers to vessels and steamers of ail nations; whilst, in his covering despatch addressed to the Foreign Office, he Lord Lyons, stated that he would take an early opportunity November 22, of speaking to Aali Pasha in reference to the 1865. delay which had taken place in opening those rivers to merchant-vessels. Both Lord Lyons and Colonel Kemball agreed Ditto, that the ' Comet,' which for many years had been attached to the Residency, should remain at Bagdad until the question of her continued employment as an unarmed despatch-boat was decided at Constantinople, but as the consul- general regarded the services of the ' Satellite ' as superfluous that vessel was sent back to India. In August of the following year (1806) Colonel Kemball reported to the Government of India Enclosure in that the 'Comet' (which had been stationed in April MSW. Turkish Arabia since 1852) had been declared unfit for further service, and advanced reasons for replacing her by a new vessel. He admitted that the actual duties of the steamer, beyond facilitating surveys and transporting mails in place of a temporarily disabled vessel belonging to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, did not perhaps justify the expense of maintenance, but urged that in view of future political contingencies the privilege of navigatin- the rivers of Mesopotamia was worth retaining'! • Namick Pasha was some .years subsequeatly 18 6 «, War'af ( Bagdad ' aDd ' Seraski « or Minister IW.) a ' tm0ple - (Mr - Elliot ' N &lt;&gt;- 29- January ,7,■ ■■■ — — ■ — ■ ' ■'» India Office, April 9, 1867.

Mr. Elliot, No. 299, July 14, 1869j 35 Isamick Pasha was then engasfed in carrying out a scheme for establishing steam communication on the Euphrates and on the Tigris,^ hoping to drive the company's steamers from the Tigris by means of a competition organised under State patronage; and in view of the probable success of this enterprise Colonel Kemball feared that the privilege of maintaining a Government vessel on the rivers, if relinquished, might not be regained. As an additional argument for replacing the Comet ' he instanced the service to be rendered by such a vessel in promoting the construction and establishment of telegraphs, railways, and other works of paramount interest to England and India. The question, after consideration by the Indian Government, of whom a majority (regarding the right to display the British flag on the rivers of Mesopotamia as a political advantage to British interests there) were in favour of replacing the ' Comet,' was submitted to the Foreign Office, and the latter held that, considering the difficulty experienced in regard to maintaining British vessels on the rivers of Mesopotamia, it was very undesirable in any degree to renounce or limit the privilege in that respect then enjoyed by this country. The question remained under consideration, and towards the end of 1868 the India Office stated that the Governor-General of India suggested there was no longer any occasion to maintain vessels on the rivers of Mesopotamia. This suggestion was referred to Constantinople for the opinion of the Ambassador, who replied that Colonel Herbert (consul-general at Bagdad) agreed with Colonel Kemball in considering the presence of a Government vessel on the Tigris to be attended with political advantage. Mr. Elliot's despatch was communicated to the India Office, who issued instructions to the Government of India to have the ' Comet' repaired. Subsequently it was decided to apply to the Turkish Government for permission to replace the vessel by a new one, and Mr. Elliot was successful in obtaining the Porte's consent * Three steamers, of a size and capacity specially suited to the traffic between Bagdad and Bussorah, had been commissioned from Belgium, aud were expected to arrive in the iShatt-el-Arab early in 1868. They were to be manned by seamen of the Turkish navy, and equipped in all respects at the expense of the State. (Enclosure in Mr. Elliot's No. 29, January 17, 1869.)36 to the proposed arrangement.' This consent was expressed in the following \\oids .

As the Government of India were inclined to ^ the opinion that it was unnecessary to replace May 22, 1870, 1 , • . m • .i and enclosures, the 44 Comet' by a vessel of similar size, and proposed to supply a steam launch in its place, Colonel Herbert wrote a strong despatch opposing the proposal, and urged that British interests in Mesopotamia required the presence on the rivers there of a Government vessel of consider- • able importance. He pointed out that, should the efforts made by Namick Pasha (and continued after his departure from Bagdad) to run the steamers of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company off the Tigris prove successful, the whole dependence of the British and Indian community would rest on the vessel attached to the Bagdad residency, and, moreover, that vessel would be the only available means of keeping up postal communication with India. Three steamers commissioned by Namick Pasha in 1866| were plying on the Tigris, and the Turkish authorities were using every meafas in their power to drive the British vessels from the river. To this end those engaged in the manage ment of the Turkish steamers desired to deprive the company of the Indian mail subsidy and to obtain it for themselves. It was feared by the local agents of the English company that they would be unable to resist the Turkish competi tion. In his covering despatch Sir H. Elliot stated that, in his opinion, if the 'Comet' were to be replaced only by a steam launch, it would be vain to attempt to obtain from the Porte permission for the retention of a larger vessel should its presence be found subsequently to be necessary. Sir H. Elliot's views were concurred m by the India Office, and communicated to the Ma Office naian Government, but no decision with regard JuDe 23 &gt; 18 ' 70 - to replacing the « Comet' was taken until some lour years later (1874).

The first had reference to Kamick Pasha's opposition to the company's operations, and related to the imposition by him of a ^0 per cent, tax on the value of wood fuel cut on the banks of the Tigris for their steamers. Colonel Kemball reported, in a telegram to the Ambassador at Constantinople, that Namick Pasha was ' bent upon defeating indirectly the Porte's sanction for the navigation of the rivers,' O 5 and that an attempt was being made to give retrospective effect to the tax, which itself had been admitted without question. This attempt was resisted, and, in consequence, the company's wood-boats were detained and a Turkish guard placed over their stacks, whilst their steamers on reaching the various dep6ts were obliged to substitute coal for wood fuel. Representations on the subject were made to the Porte, and the incident seems then to have come to an end although the question of the company's liability to pay the tax came up for consideration later, as will be seen in the next paragraph. As regards the second matter, the company represented that the Bagdad Government vessels (the three steamers commissioned by Namick Pasha, see pages 35 and 36) were conveying mer chandise between Bagdad and Bussorah at such low freight rates as to indicate that the authorities sought to drive the company's vessels off the rivers. They stated that, when placing their steamers on the Tigris under the authority given in 1861, they had been anxious to please the local Government and acquiesced, under protest, in the payment of a heavy tonnage duty called ' gali- beah' (kalibiyeh) levied at Bagdad on native vessels, ' but from which British vessels had been,exempt,' and in the payment of import duty on coal, although strictly in transit only from one British vessel to another, and of the 20 per cent, tax on wood, purchased or cut on the banks of the Tigris, instituted in 1866. In view of the fact that they were subjected to local opposition and to the ruinous competition of untaxed Turkish Government vessels, the company enquired if they were fairly liable to pay the taxes mentioned, and asked for the inter vention of the British Embassy at Constantinople, [163—1] L38 as the position ot affairs tended to abrogate their concession, in connection with which they h.i embarked a large capital. They pointed out that the company's contract with the Indian Govern ment tor conveyance of mails bad been punctual y fulfilled, and that this service would be serious v affected if the British flag were driven from the river. Sir H. Elliot was informed that the Jo Sir H. Elliot, company's statement relative to the punctual commercial, fulfilment of their mail contract was correct, May 17,1869. and that public inconvenience would result from interruption of the then existing arrangements. On these grounds it was held that the company deserved such support as properly could be given by Her Majesty's Government, and, therefore, whilst the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was not in a position to pronounce an opinion on the charges of which the company complained, the Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed to make representations to the Turkish Govern ment on the company's behalf. The result of Sir H. Elliot's representations does not appear to % have been reported homo, and the matter seems to have dropped. Next year (1870) the company desired to obtain Euphrates and permission to place a third steamer on the Tigris to meet the requirements of their trade. They Company, remarked in a letter addressed to the Eoreign October 19 ' Office;— ' The two vessels we already have are supposed to be authorised by special firman, and we are not sure if we have the right to employ a third or more without special permission.' In reference to this matter, the India Office India Office, pointed out that there were in the waters of November 3 « 1870 i Turkish Arabia, ' irrespectively of the ' Comet,' .... the full number of vessels allowed by special firman,' and that the right to maintain a British Government vessel should be reserved if steps were taken to obtain the admission of a larger number. Nothing, however, seems to have been done, and the company's letter apparently remained unanswered. With reference to the Bagdad Government steamers, it may be mentioned that one of them was leported in 1870 to be plying on the Enclosure in Jiuplirates between A 'anah and Belis, and that f ?;. E ' liot ' 8 i was proposed to send others up that river on Octow'24,1870. the same service. In this year the navigation the Euphrates engaged the attention of38* Vice-Consul Mayers, May 3, 1870.

Midhat Pasha, Governor-General of Bagdad, who appointed a commission (accompanied by Vice- Consul Mayers) to investigate the state of the river, with a view to the establishment, if possible, of a regular line of steamers between Belis and Mussayeb, with railway connection between the latter place and Bagdad, from which there was a steam-ship service to Bussorah. In the despatch covering his report on the result of the expedition, Yice-Consul Mayers remarked that he hoped Her Majesty's Government and the Porte ' would be induced to take up again a question of so much importance to both, but which had been allowed to lie dormant for the last thirty-five years.' Apparently it was further intended to open communication between Belis and Aleppo, and thence to the Mediterranean; and there was hope, too, of connecting Belis and Bagdad by water by means of the Kana'aniyeh Canal. On receipt of Vice-Consul Mayers' report, Sir H. Elliot was instructed to express to Aali Pasha Her Majesty's Government's hope that the Porte would not relax in their laudable [163-1]39 Mr. T. K.

As the result of canal cutting, navigation of the Tigris at low water became almost impossible, and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company purchased in 1872 a small steam- launch (the ' Despatch '), owned and apparently used on the river as a pleasure-boat by a Erench gentleman employed in the service of the local Turkish Government, for the purpose of conveying mails when the water was too low for their regular steamers to ply. The launch was employed in this way in 1872, seemingly without protest, but in the following year the Bagdad authorities prohibited its running during the low season without special sanction of the Ottoman Government. When reporting the matter to the Ambassador at Constantinople the consul-general at Basrdad remarked that the Governor-General there seemed to imply in his correspondence that no British subject would be allowed to use even a pleasure steam-launch on the river without special sanction, and Colonel Herbert suggested that the time had come when the Mesopotamian rivers should be thrown open to general naviga tion. Sir H . Elliot represented the case to the Porte, and obtained an assurance that orders would be given to the local authorities to cease their opposition to the use of the ' Despatch. The company reported that these orders were worded : ' No objection to the use of the steam- launch provided only two steamers are used at one time,' and they pointed out that this limita tion practically prohibited its employment. It was remarked by Sir H. Elliot that their request, in the first instance, was for permission to employ the launch in the conveyance of mails when the lowness of water prevented the two regular steamers from running; but, acting on fresh instructions, he succeeded in persuading the Porte to authorise the employment of the ' Despatch ' on all occasions when needed. On receipt of a report on the subject from the Vali of Bagdad, who had not acted upon the orders sent to him, the Porte, however, receded from their previous decision. Permission was subse quently obtained for the employment of the ' Despatch ' during the repair of the ' Dijleh/ &gt; but proved to be of no avail, as the repairs were executed before the authority for the employ ment of the launch could be transmitted to40 Bagdad. Finally, in March 1875 the 1'orte ^ ^ • authorised the employment of the ' Despatch March 31,187o. on the Tigris in exceptional cases and when the water was low. At the time when negotiations in reference to the ' Despatch ' were in progress the Euphrates Navigation and Tigris Steam Navigation Company were ^^ary 11,1874. making arrangements to replace one of theii vessels, 'City of London,' by another steamer which they proposed to send out. An application was accordinsrly made to the Porte for permission Mr. Locock, . , , Mo. 14», to substitute the new steamer for the old one. May 12, 1874. but was refused on the ground that at that time there were four British vessels on the Tigris instead of the two steamers allowed by firman. The Porte's refusal was based on inaccurate Sir H. Elliot, No 82 statements made by Eedif Pasha, Vali of Bagdad, j u iV 13^ 1374, who led his Government to believe that the aiia ^closures.

The fourth vessel referred to was assumed to be the ' Despatch,' which, however, was not then plying on the river. The other two vessels, ' City of London ' and ' Dijleh,' were described by Colonel Herbert, when reporting on the question, as ' those specially provided for by the firman of the 29th December, 1834 (con firmed to permit the formation of this company by vizierial letter of the 15th January, 1861), which does not allude and does not directly apply to Government vessels which are not employed in trade.'

Musurus Pasha, May 7, 1874. Sir H. Elliot, No. 34, June 11, 1874, Sir H. Elliot remarked that, when discussing the ' Comet ' question with the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, he was careful not to claim for Her Majesty's Government a right to station a man-of-war in inland waters, but at the same time to let it be understood that a privilege which had been freely granted for so many years could not be suddenly withdrawn without forcing Her Majesty's Government to enquire whether the Porte were animated by the same friendly feelings as formerly towards Great Britain.' In connection with the question of the presence of British ships of war on Mesopotamian waters, an incident* occurred about this time which gave rise to considerable correspondence. Musurus Pasha complained in May 1874 that Her Majesty's ship 'Philomel' had proceeded without authority up the Shatt-el-Arab beyond Bussorah as far as Kurna, at the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates, and he asked that the vessel should be recalled and the commander reprimanded. The Governor-General of Bagdad also pro tested to the consul-general there against the * This incident was dealt with at some length in a Library Memorandum of February 8, 1881, Confidential 4802. [163—1]42 impropriety of the ' Philomel' proceeding to Kurna without notice ; and the latter, in his reply, pointed out that the Shatt-el -Arab had always been regarded as a free river, that it the custom for sea-going craft under foreign flags to take in cargo at Kurna, and that no objection had been raised previously when British and French ships of war had v isit (, il tlicit place. Redif Pasha denied that the river from Bussorah to Kurna was a free river, and main tained that ' the Turkish side with its depend encies to the point below Bussorah on the Shatt-el-Arab, and specially both banks above Bussorah, being the real possession of the Ottoman Government, the entry of foreign merchant-vessels, and specially vessels of war, into rivers such as this, of which the fountain- head and outlet are situated within the dominion of the Ottoman Government, unless it be with the consent and acquiescence of the Government was, according to rules, inadmissible.' In reference to this case. Sir H. Elliot observed that there could be no doubt as to the right of the Porte to exclude vessels of war from the Meso potamian rivers; but he pointed out to the Porte that, as it had been the practice until then for British ships of war to visit Kurna, due notice of any alteration in that respect of the Porte's regulations should have been given to Her Majesty's Government. In the meantime an assurance had been given to the Governor- General of Bagdad that no British ship of war would ascend the river pending settlement of the question at Constantinople. The question, how ever, was not pursued to a settlement, and no reply, although promised, was apparently re turned to Musurus Pasha. Shortly after the 'Philomel' incident the Bagdad authorities not only refused to allow a steam launch, belonging to Messrs. Lynch to carry passengers between Bussorah and Moham- merah, hut also seized the boat. Sir H. Elliot Sir H. Elliot, reported that, as the launch bad not a British J? 0 '' 49 ' nd 50, register* be was in doubt whether be could insist AuguTStd 81, on the vessel's right to engage in foreign trade 1874 - had no ^rlatv' 1 ^']' 1 !- reP '^' that Great Britain T„ S lr R E.liot, ad no treaty stipulations with Turkey by which No - U0 ' she could claim the right of navigating the in- Reptember 6 ' 1874 - 0f WaS is8ued b &gt;-43 Sir H Elliot.

To this Sir II. Elliot replied that the launch had no connection with the vessels navigating the internal waters of Meso potamia under imperial firman, and the question raised was whether, in the absence of special sanction, it could be claimed ihat the launch had the right to convey passengers between Eussorah and Mohammerah. In a library memorandum on the subject, it was argued that Her Majesty's Government could not claim the right in question unless the launch ' came under privileges granted by the vizierial letters of 1834, 1846, and 1861, and, &lt;js there was doubt whether the vizicrinl letter of 1846 was still in face, Sir H. Elliot was instructed to ascertain if the privileges granted by that letter had ever been abrogated. He, however, considered it unsafe to make any enquiry at the Porte which could be regarded as implying that there was doubt upon the subject; and remarked that, as the whole question \\ as being examined by the Turkish Government, it would be time to state the views of Her Majesty's Government if and wdien officially informed of the existence of sufficient grounds for denying the right of British ships to navigate the rivers. He further observed that 'if our rights upon these rivers are limited to those granted by the firman and vizierial letters, we do not seem en titled to claim more than the maintenance of the two vessels originally named; but, if Her Majesty's Government hold that we have a general right of navigation upon international principles, the claim would be weakened by a reference to the special permissions in virtue of which the steamers have hitherto plied.' The steam launch'j' had meanwhile been released, and allowed to ply between Bussorah and Moham merah without impediment. Sir H. Elliot thought it undesirable, in these circumstances, to make further representations to the Porte, and the matter w 7 as allowed to drop. * This statement was based on the Law Officers' Report of '7^ Governor of Bagdad considered the launch to be not a seagoing but a river steamer and pointed out, prior to its detention, that Messrs. Lynch's steamers 'ran with per mission.'44 Here it may be useful to remark that in the correspondence of 1873-5, relative to the various matters referred to in the preceding paragraphs, the privileges accorded to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company were regarded by the Foreign Office, the Ambassador at Con stantinople, and the consul-general at Bagdad, as well as by the Porte, as limited in regard to the number of steamers to be employed by the firman of 1834) mentioned in the vizierial letter of 1861. This limitation was a^ain referred to 5 r No. 262 by Sir H. Elliot when opposing a suggestion October^, 1874. made by Colonel Herbert in 1874, that Messrs. Lynch's country boats (used for conveying grain, &amp;c.), which had been impressed by the Turkish authorities and forced by them to carry soldiers and stores, should be authorised to carry the British flag for their protection and to prevent similar occurrences in the future. He'feared that such use of the British flag would be re- , garded as the assumption of a right, as regards navigation of the Mesopotamian rivers, which there was no disposition to concede. SirH. Elliot was of opinion that British rights sir H. Elliot, of navigation on the rivers of Mesopotamia were No -.if6. not clear, and further, that the right of non- Apr ' 1 8 ' 1875 ' riverain Powers to trade on Ottoman inland waters could not certainly be so considered. He pointed out that, although the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's steam- launch plying between Bussorah and Moham- merah bad not latterly been interfered with it was only running on sufferance ; and that, more- over the Porte had not intimated acquiescence &gt;n e rig it of the vessel to trade between the ' r ST; T had he been ins{rU(;ted claim • It had been reported that Messrs..Lynch intended employing as team-tug and two iigL's , ^ oj' to the steam-launch, to carry on trade and Mohammerab, and Sir H.

Lynch in any difficulties arising from the employ ment of the vessels without the consent of the Porte. It was apparently assumed by the Foreign Office that Messrs. Lvnch intended to place the tug and lighters on the Tigris and Euphrates, and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company were accordingly notified that Her Majesty's Government were not pre pared to ask for further privileges for them than, those already accorded by the Porte. The company, however, disclaimed any intention of employing the vessels on those rivers, or on the Sliatt-el-Arab between Bussorah and Moham- merah, and the matter dropped. Under the authority given in 1875 a new vessel, ' Blosse Lynch,'* was sent out to Bussorah in 1876 to replace the 'City of London.' A few months previously the Dijleh' had been wrecked, and permission was obtained from the Porte to run a new steamer, and to continue the employment of the City of London' pending its arrival. Authority for the ' Dijleh's' successor was worded-as follows :— ' Comme MM. Lynch et Cie. sont autorises eu vertu d'nn firman Imperial a employer deux bateaux pour le service des passagers et des marchandises sur le Tigre, la Sublime Porte n'a aucune objection a ce que le bateau qui s'est perdu soit remplace par un autre ancien ou nouveau ayant les memes dimensions que celles du ' Dijleh.'

The company objected to the condition (' k which was not in the original Eirman ') restricting the dimension of the new steamer, and the charge d'affaires at Constantinople was directed to call the Porte's attention to the point raised. The result e of his action dees not seem to have been reported home.

This suggestion was referred to the To Sir H.

He reported ^ ir Layard, that in March of the previous year (1878) he had May 27, 1879. requested the Porte to issue a firman sanctioning the employment of the extra steamer, and trans mitted their reply (received after more than a year's delay) refusing hrs application, on the ground that the requirements of the case would be met by improvements which' were to be made in the service of the Oman Ottoman Company.

The company stated, in the course of their letter, that they had been engaged since 1861 in navigation of the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris ' by ' special firman :i} from the Porte,' and that the firman limited the number of their vessels to two. They suggested that, if permission could be obtained from the Porte for the employment of additional steamers on the larger service indicated, a subsidy should be granted by Her Majesty's Government to enable them to carry out their object. The Poreign Office were opposed to the grant of a subsidy, but con sidered the limitation of the number of British steamers to be ' an abomination which should To Sir H. Layard, g 0 t nd of,'t and Sir H. Layard was instructed iNo. by, November 4,1879. to urge the Porte to remove the restrictions imposed on the navigation of the rivers of Mesopotamia by vessels under the British flag. He, however, considered the moment inoppor tune to approach them on the subject, as they were then in a suspicious temper, and as attempts had been made to persuade the Sultan that Great Britain was seeking to destroy his authority in his Asiatic dominions with the view ultimately of annexing them. Earlv in i8b0 information was received from * Bagdad respecting a proposal to lease the Turkish Government steamers on the Tigris to native merchants, with a monopoly of navigation for fifteen years, exception being made in favour of the two British steamers. Foreigners were to be excluded from the arrangement, the conditions of which prohibited any increase of British steamers on the river. Sir H. Layard, however, was informed by the Porte that the proposed monopoly would not be granted, and the scheme seems to have been dropped.

The foreign law officers of the Porte reported the claim to be well founded, and Sawas Pasha stated that ^ Holland was the only Power which had a treaty with the Porte conferring this right.' Nothing further on the subject, however, was reported from Constantinople at this time, but in 1884 incidental reference was made to the matter (page 72). In connection with the subjects dealt with in Sir H. Layard, the two preceding paragraphs, Sir H. Layard urged upon the Porte the importance of opening the rivers of Mesopotamia to steam navigation* and of not granting any monopoly of it to a Turkish or any other company.

As a result of his representations orders were sent to the Vali of Bagdad to permit the towing of barges, but they were not received or, at all events, not acted upon by the local authorities. Ihe company thereupon wrote to the Foreign Office to urge that the prohibition should be removed, and stated that ' cargo boats (belong ing to British subjects) had from time immemorial been employed in the navigation of these rivers (Tigris and Euphrates), both tracked by men, and on occasion towed by steam power.' Further representations were made to the Porte, who assured Sir H. Layard that instructions to remove the prohibition had been sent; and the Turkish Ambassador in London communicated to Lord Granville a telegram from his Government statingr ^ n that orders* had been telegraphed to the local authorities e ' afin que les deux bateaux de la Compagnie Lynch puissent remonter des schlepps, des mahonnes et meme des caiques, pourvu qu'elle consente a transporter des cereales aux endroits ou r^gue la disette.' Musurus Pasha was informed in reference to the condition relative to the conveyance of cereals, that Her Majesty's Government did not consider that any condition of this nature could be imposed on the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates by the vessels of the company; and at the same time the company were desired to explain the precise state of the case as to the employment of barges and boats. They replied as follows :— ' In reply, I have to inform your Lordship that both before and after the firman of 1834, granting the right of navigation for two steamers, large boats under the English flag navigated those rivers free from all exactions to which native-owned boats were subjected. In 1846 it was, by order of the Porte, arranged that all these boats employed in internal trade for the trans mission of cargo should continue the navigation under their foreign flags, but sluruld pay the same taxes (' droits') as those owned by Ottoman subjects, thus implying and confirming the prescriptive right. ' The injurious effect of this tax was apparent, and all dues, at the instigation of Her Majesty's Ambassador * In a telegraphic communication dated May 28,1880, from the Porte to the Turkish Charg^ d'Affaires in Loudon, these orders were described as permitting the company's ships ' de remorquer des schlepps, des mahonnes et meme des voiliers transportant des cereales aux endroits oil r^-gne la famine.' [163- ■i] o50 at Constantinople, were shortly afterwards entirely abolished. That this arrangement did not refer to steamers is proved by the fact that, there were at that time no trading steamers on the rivers of Mesopotamia either native or foreign owned. 'I am also in a position to state that in 184b, when this question was under consideration, the firm ot Messrs S Lynch and Co. and others, both Persian and Indian subjects, possessed boats of 150- to 200-ton8 burden navigating the rivers and transporting mer chandise, and, since the formation of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, the same description of boats, the property of British subjects, have been employed uninterruptedly in conveying coal and fire wood for the use of the steamers, and for other pur poses, occasionally being towed by the steamers. ' Last year, owing to the low state of the river, and a consequent cessation of through communication, which was greatly to the detriment of commerce, my directors decided upon providing steel barges of light draft, never doubting that they might be employed with out restriction, as has always been the case with the boats previously alluded to. They were accordingly sent out and commenced working last December, being lashed alongside and towed by the company's steamers. No question regarding their employment was raised until Maich, when, in obedience to orders from here the rate of freight on grain was temporarily reduced to a minimum with a view of alleviating the distress at Bag- dad arising from scarcity of food. It was then that their employment was arbitrarily prohibited by the local Turkish authorities, a step which can only be accounted for on the presumption that they, view the reduction of freight as detrimental to the pecuniary interests of the 1 urkish steamers.' '• 1 trust your Lordship will consider that this despotic- policy, to interfere with the right to transmit English an, Indian merchandise, now arriving at Bussorah on through bills of lading for Bagdad, by boat or barge manned by natives of the country, cannot be defended, whether tracked or towed by steamers, forsteam vessels are introduced ' to facilitate commerce ' (see Firman', to prevent them from utilising their power in towW Step 5 in the ^ a Temporary permission for the employment of £rx:-r dbytho com ^ :[ Lord Granville •' tb^Xst^v reqUe9ted ^gafeT 1 a ^ ains t and reoudijifo Com P an yi the implied authority of the Turkish Tnv May 2(S ' 1880 to impose any limitation on theiTri^ 0 7! boats and barges in the navigation o lb P ? of Mesopotamia—a rH,t wv\ ? tho nVe *&gt; hy all nationalities from tim 6 Wed s r 10,11 t'me immemorial ' Th„ * Rnnan of J83451 company contended that the prohibition could not be enforced on the plea that steel had been substituted for wood in the construction of the boats, or on the ground that a more expeditious method of towing had been adopted in place of the more primitive method of tracking previously To Mr. Goschen, invo^ue.

Before doing so he enquired if permission to use the barges was claimed as a right or asked for as a favour, and was informed that Her Majesty's Government regarded permission to use barges as a right. Mr. Goschen addressed a note to the Porte on the 22nd August, 1880, requesting information respecting the regulations preventing small boats and craft, such as barges, from navigating the Euphrates,and asking on what ground the towing of barges by the company's steamers was authorised only as a temporary measure. In their reply of the 16th December, 1880, the Porte at Constantinople), stated that— ' La navigation de I'Enphrate n'est point ouverte aux pavilions etrangers, et que c'est en vertu d'un firrnan special qn'il a et^ concede k Messieurs Lynch de faire naviguer deux bateaux a vapeur sur ce fleuve.

Mr. Goschen, who was then in England, stated January 12,1881. ^at, before Mr. Plowden, consul-general at Bagdad, had left for his post, he had discussed with the latter the question of the towing of barges, and neither of them had much confidence that the claim could be sustained as a right. To Mr. St. John, Mr. Goschen suggested, however, that the Porte's No. 4, Commercial, n0 ^ e s i 10U l&lt;i be communicated to Mr. Plowden January 17, 1881. . with instructions to conrer with the company s agent at Bagdad in order to examine whether usao-e or any other ground would enable further arguments to be brought forward; and his suggestion was adopted. * There is nothing to explain why the Euphrates was mentioned and not the Tigris.

' Mr. Goechen s attention should be drawn to the fact that the Law Officers reported on a previous occasion* that the right to navigate the rivers of the Ottoman Empire under the British flag was not secured to British subjects by treaty. The only right, therefore, which the Euphrates and Tigris Company could have to navigate the Mesopotamian rivers would seem to be that derived from the firman of the 29th December 1834, and the vizierial letters of the 2nd April, 1846,' and the 15th January, 1861, since no special firman in their favour has ever been produced. But whether that firman arid those vizierial letters confer upon the company the permanent right to navigate those rivers, eit er by their steamers or their barges, is a point which as never really been satisfactorily settled; and fo 0 ? 11011 informed on the 19th June, 880, that Her Majesty's Government considered that the company had a right to use barges on those rivers am although it has been repeatedly shown that British mtei ests should be fully protected in those rivers and f possible, extended, still the fact remains that no formal doenment (beyond those quoted above) has been produced showing- how fhp ™ -oh a right, or ^ T™ ledged by the Tnrki.h Government.'

The British Government has under the firmans ' of 1834 and 1841, which have been confirmed by the vizierial letters of 1861 and 1862, the right, subject to certain specified conditions, to navigate the Euphrates ' for purposes of trade.' ' 2. Under the arrangement of 1846, also confirmed in the vizierial letters of 1861 and 1862, British merchants are at liberty to navigate the Euphrates and Tigris under the British flag and without restriction as to the number or description of the vessels employed, subject only to the payment of the stipulated dues. ' 3. That the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Naviga tion Company have no firman granting them an exclusive privilege to navigate the Tigris with two, and only two, steamers. Their rights really depend on the arrangement of 1846, and so far are neither greater nor less than those which may be claimed by any British merchant.' Mr. Plow den further submitted that article 2S of the Capitulations (confirmed by articles 1 and 2 of the treaty of 1861), and article 8 of the treaty of commerce of 1861, ilf conferred on British subjects the right to engage in trade, internal and foreign, anywhere in Turkey, to load mer chandise and transmit it in their ships from one part of the Sultan's dominions to another part, and to employ under identical conditions British merchant-vessels in any part of the Turkish Empire in which Ottoman ships may be employed, just as reciprocally in British dominions Ottoman vessels may go wherever British vessels may go. As Ottoman merchant-steamers plied up and down the Tigris, therefore, he argued, British vessels were also entitled to navigate that river for purposes of commerce. Prior to the receipt of Mr. Plowden's report, a letter was received from the Euphrates and Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company stating that Tigris steam ^eiv right to use barges was founded on the Company, a vizierial letter of the 2nd April, 1846, confirming April 2, 1881. a they had long previously enjoyed, the words used in the vizierial letter being ' que * No longer in force. [163—1] r54 les baliments anglais peuvent faire le commerce dans les deux fleuves susmentionnes en payant les droits etablis par le traits.' They remarked that their right to employ steamers was ' founded on another firman :;: ' for commercial purposes,' and that it was an interference with this right if . they were not allowed to use barges, necessary for the loading and discharging of cargo, and to tow them when required to pass over shallow parts of the river. They asserted, in conclusion, that they had already enjoyed the right of using boats and barges (' Mtiments, navires et barques ') on both rivers. Sir E. Hertslet's memorandum of the 27th To Mr. Goscheo, March, and Mr. Plowden's despatch of the 28th Commercial, March were communicated to Mr. Goschen, and Ma y 1881. he was informed that the facts appeared to be as follows:— ' The general right to navigate the rivers of the Ottoman Empire under the British flag is not secured to British subjects by treaty. In 1834 the Porte granted a firman allowing two British steamers to ply on the Euphrates. In 1846 Sir Stratford Canning concluded an arrangement with the Porte, which is recorded in a despatch from the Grand Vizier to the Pasha of Bagdad, dated the 2nd April, 1846. In this document it is stated that the British Ambassador having represented in a tacrxr that ' les batiments anglais peuvent faire le commerce dans les deux fleuves susmentionn^s en payant les droits ^tablis par le traits' the matter was referred to the Finance Minister, whose report thereon was agreed to by the British Ambassador, and approved by the Sultan , and the Grand Vizier in the despatch referred to directs the Pasha of Bagdad to levy „„ barques de commerce anglais, qui, comme il a kik dit p us haut, seront d^ormais occurs i faire le commerce mteneur eur les deux fleuves susdite ' the same duties as on Turkish 'barques' simUarly engaged In tJm note from tho Porte (enclosure in Mr. St. John's No 44 the ab0ve firml oSr T ^ they ^ their ^ ™ the the Euphrates ' ^ ^ et ~ P&gt;y - It was pointed out to Mr. Go^h^n ti * ^ privilege at the dat^ f en Joyed that e ''' n ' , ' y they referred to the 6rman of 1 834.55 Lord Dufferin, No. 68, Commercial, July 25, 1881.

Mr. Goschen was instructed to represent that the Porte had left out of consideration altogether the facts stated in this and the preceding paragraph, and to press them to direct the local authorities to desist from further interference with the com pany's barges. Representations in the sense of the instructions given to Mr. Goschen were made to Said Pasha, the Ottoman Prime Minister, by Lord Dufferin (newly appointed Ambassador at Constantinople), who took the opportunity to represent the desira bility of opening the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates without restriction to British ships. His representations on both questions were, he said, not unfavourably received. Meanwhile, a claim for demurrage in respect of the detention of their barges had been put in by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam .Navigation Company on the ground that the prohibition of their barges by the local authorities was an illegal act, as under the arrangement of 1846, naviga tion of the Euphrates and Tigris by barges and boats owned by British subjects had been authorised by the Porte, and the authority could not be revoked except by notice given by the British and Ottoman Governments. In the course of correspondence on the subject between Consul-General Plowden and the Vali of Bagdad, the latter maintained that, according to the ' firman granting privilege of navigation to the company, right to employ two steamers only was accorded, and the towing of barges by these steamers or &lt;c employment of something else' was beyond the permission and privilege. Mr. Plowden, when reporting on the subject to Mr. Goschen, remarked that the main question raised was the construction and operation of the agreement of 1846 read with article 23 of the Capitulations and with the Commercial Treaty of 1861, and that upon the determination of this question depended the right of British merchants in general, and of Messrs. Lynch in particular to navigate the rivers of Mesopotamia. * Mr Plowden asked the vali for a copy of this firman, but it was not produced^56 It was decided to submit the following two ^ questions to the Law Officers lor their opinion . iaHl XVI). 1. How far the general right to navigate the Euphrates and Tigris can be claimed tor British vessels under the arrangement of 1846. 2. Whether the right claimed by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to tow barges on those rivers can properly be main tained. The papers* submitted to them were :— 1. Sir E. Hertslet's memorandum of the 27th March, 1881. 2. Consul-General Plowden's No. 2, Com mercial, 28th March, 1881. 3. To Mr. Goschen, No. 16th May, 18S1 ; and Consul-General Plowden's Nos. 3 and 4, Commercial, 20th and 31st May, 1881. 4. Eirman of 1834 and vizierial letters of 1846 and 1861. 5.

British treaty with Turkey of 1861 and Capitulations (' Uertslet's Treaties relative to Trade ' (Turkey), pp. 8 and 41). Having taken these papers into consideration, Law Officers, the Law Officers reported as follows : November 18, 1881 That the evidence of the avrangement made by XVII). Sir Stratford Canning in 1846, and of the nature of the nghts which it confers, conaists almost exclnsively , despatch of the 18th March, 1846, in which he informs Her Majesty's Government that the arrange- ment has been arrived at. The only document under e land of any representative of the Turkish Govern- ment on which reliance can be placed as affording against them evidence of the arrangement is, so far at we are aware, the despatch of Raouf Pasha to the Governor of Bagdad of the 2nd April, 1846 That despatch appears to be chieHy concerned with ones tions of tariff, and of the duties to be levied on foreign as compared with Turkish vessels It is t an announcement of m * .It is not British vessels the rigU to COnCedin e »&lt;&gt; and Euphrates under their own^Tg tainly by inference seems to ? g ' Cer - —^na'vigating'57 and will continue to navigate, those rivers for the purpose of internal commerce. And if, subsequent to, that despatch. British commercial steamers, in con tinuance of prior usage, had navigated the rivers with no warrant beyond what is contained in it, and without objection by the Turkish authorities, these facts,, coupled with the despatch of Raouf Pasha, would afford cogent evidence against the Turkish autho rities that an arrangement rendering this course legitimate had been entered into. ' It appears, however, that no British steamer was placed upon either the Tigris or Euphrates prior to the year J 862 except the two vessels which had been navigating them before 1846, under the authority of the firman of the 29th December, 1834. ' It is necessary, therefore, carefully to examine the circumstances which intervene between the date of the arrangement in question and the year 1862. ' It appears that, in 1859, Messrs. Lynch and Co., having in view the establishing a line of steamers on the Tigris and Euphrates, entered into communication with Sir H. Bulwer, at that time Her Majesty's Am bassador at Constantinople. Sir H. Bulwer (whether from having overlooked the agreement of 1846 or from some other cause does not appear) expressed the view that Messrs. Lynch could not, without further authority from the Turkish Government, claim the right per manently to navigate the river with steamers carrying the British flag. But the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir H. Bulwer, in answer to his enquiries, that if Messrs. Lynch were to apply to the Porte for a firman of concession to establish a line of steamers to run between Bagdad and Bussorah the Porte would, he thought, not be averse to an arrange ment of that nature. Upon this Messrs. Lynch sub mitted to Sir H. Bulwer an application for a firman ' granting them the requisite sanction to navigate the rivers of the country with British-registered steam- vessels.' No answer was received to this application until 1861. In January of that year Sir H. Bulwer transmitted a vizierial letter to the Pasha of Bagdad. The terms of that document are important. It begins by reciting that the British Embassy had made communi cations for the purpose of obtaining a renewal of the orders sent concerning k ' the British steamers and boats authorised by His Majesty to ply on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates.' It then recites the firman of 1834 and the report of 1846 with reference to the duties to be levied on British vessels, and the despatch of Raouf Pasha of the 2nd April, 1846, founded upoii it, and it concludes by instructing the pasha ' to act according to these rules.' It is to be observed that this despatch treats as in full force the firman of 1834 authorising the British Government testation two steamers on the River Euphrates at Bagdad, and to run them by turns for the purpose of facilitating trade ; and that the part of the despatch which is more general in its terms and [163—1] Q58 has reference to the vizierial letter of 1846 deals with the financial question only. 'This seems hardly consistent with the idea that the arrangement announced by Sir Stratford Canning treated as being then in force, and having the effect to be gathered from his despatch. T or that arrange ment, which permitted British merchant steamers without limit of number to ply on the rivers would override the extremely limited authority given by the firman of 1834. And the various applications made by Sir H. Bulwer to the Porte resulting in his receiving from them the vizierial instructions of January 1861, were wholly unnecessary if such an arrangement as was communicated to Her Majesty's Government in 1846 was still in force. ' In 1862 Messrs. Lynch and Co. placed their first Bteamer on the rivers. Their second followed in the year 1864, and as early as that date the Turkish authorities distinctly asserted that, under existing firmans, only two British steamers were permitted to navigate the Tigris. From that time to the present, the Government of Turkey has persistently adhered to that position. The use of more than two steamers has during all this period been only exceptional, and has never been permitted without remonstrance, and the assertion that it could not be claimed as a right. These remonstrances appear to have been acquiesced in from time to time, and notably in the memorandum of the British Embassy (if it be correctly quoted by Ali Pasha) in 1864. And the British Ambassador has on vanous occasions sought permission for acts, the title to do which would have been clear under the reported arrangement of 1846. ' Considering, therefore, the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence of that arrangement so far as Turkish documents are concerned, and that the authority alleged to have been given appears not to have been acted upon, that for nearly twenty years the Turkish Government have practically denied its existence, and that Her .Majesty's representatives at the Porte so far from msisting that it existed, and relying „p 0I1 it&gt; have sought permission which would have been needless if it were m force we think the general right to navigate British'™ 'l E 7 hrateS 0annot now be claimed by British vessels under the arrangement of 1846. think'thf' 18 the 8eCOnd &lt;1Ue8ti0n submi tted to us, we think the company are entitled to emplov steamers aving authority to ply upon the Rivers Tigris and veseels are o d P ur P 08e8 ^ which such vessels are ordinarily employed, and we think ft would probably includp + • p ™th merchandise ^ 0f bar « eS lad - But we would observe thaf if i for British steamers to run o n the J from the firman of 1834 ' ' ^ ers 18 derived insisted upon on then .

Bulwer* a permission open to revocation by the Turkish Government.' The foregoing opinion was signed by the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General. Dr. Deane, the third Law Officer consulted, agreed with his colleagues in the answer to the first question, but differed with them in regard to the second, on which his views were thus expressed:— ' I think the permission given to a limited number of steamers to navigate the rivers does not include the leave to tow barges laden with merchandise. ' At the time of the firman in 1834 towing was not, I consider, in the view of the Turkish Government. No extension of the leave given in the firman has since been conceded. ' The towing of barges would obviously, to a very great extent, add to the carrying power of the steamers; and such use of the steamers, in my opinion, is not within the intention, and certainly not within the letter, of the permission given by the Turkish Government. ' I am, therefore, of opinion that the right claimed by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany to tow barges on those rivers cannot properly be maintained.' • Lord Dufferin, Whilst the papers were under consideration Nos. 101 and 118, by the Law Officers, Lord Dufferin reported November i and that the Ottoman Ministerial Council had ac- December 2,1881. ce( ] e( j demands in regard to the employment of barges by the company, and it only remained for the Sultan to issue an irade. This, however, the Sultan could not be induced to do, although repeated applications were made to him per sonally and to his Ministers by the Ambassador at Constantinople. A new steamer, the ' Mejidieh,' was sent out in pieces to Bagdad in 1883 by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to replace the ' Blosse Lynch,' and a note verbale was addressed to the Porte by Mr. Wyndham, charge d'affaires at Constantinople, requesting that in structions should be sent to the local authorities not. to interfere with the reconstruction and employment of the vessel. Exception, however, was taken by the Porte to the size of the steamer as exceeding the dimensions fixed by the vizierial letters authorising the company to establish their service, and they declined on this account, and on the ground that the two steamers on the Mr. Wvndham, No. 162, Commercial, June 27, 1883, and enclosures.61 Consul-General Plowden, June 24, 1883. To Musurus Pasha, July 5, 1883. Parliamentary question and answer (Mr. A. Arnold), July 12, 1883. Mr. Wyndham, No. 193, Commercial, July 11, 1883. Consul-General Plowden, in a memorandum dated the 2ith J une, argued that the company's right to run steamers on the Tigris—and on the Euphrates also—was derived from the arrange ment of 1846, and that the firmans of 1834 and 1841 were granted to the British Government and not to any individual or firm, and related only to the Euphrates. He pointed out the mis take made in 1864 in allowing to pass unrefuted the fundamental argument of the Porte that the company's rights were based on these firmans, and suggested that the opportunity had arrived to restate the case and place those rights on their proper basis. The British case was set forth in a note addressed to the Turkish Ambassador, on the 5th July (Appendix XV[II), wherein British rights of navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates were based on the arrangement of 1846, recorded in the vizierial letter of the 2nd April of that year, and confirmed by the vizierial letter of the 15th January, 1861, Shortly after the note of the 5th July was communicated to Musurus Pasha, the Under- Secretary of State for Eoreign Affairs stated in the House of Commons that Her Majesty's Government had protested to the Turkish Am bassador in London, and through Her Majesty's charge d'affaires at Constantinople, against the action of the Vali of Bagdad in forcibly stopping the traffic of the company's steamers on the Tigris, and had reserved all rights against the Porte for the consequences. ' The right to navi gate the Tigris,' he remarked, ' was not granted by any firman, but has been exercised under an arrangement obtained by Sir Stratford Canning in 1846, and confirmed by vizierial letters ad dressed to the Vali of Bagdad in 1846, 1861, and 1862.' Mr. Wyndham, reporting the representations made by him against the Turkish proceedings respecting the company's steamers, stated that he had drawn the special attention of the Porte to the arrangement of 1846, and had furnished them with copies of the vizierial letters of the 2nd April, 1846, and the 15th January, 1861, and had pointed out (through the embassy drago man) that, according to the terms of those vizierial letters, there was no limitation as to the number or size of the vessels or boats under the British flag which had received permission to [163—1] R62 navigate or to engage in trade in the Mesopo- tamian rivers. Mr. Wyndham feared that, attei the correspondence which passed in 187^ and 1874, as to the number of vessels to be employed by the company on. the river, it would be difficult to induce the Ottoman Government to allow the company to run a greater number of steamers than thev had done hitherto. * In a later despatch Mr. 'Wyndham stated that Mr. Wyndham, . • • No. 201 he had called on Aarifi Pasha, Ottoman Minister Commercial, for Foreign Affairs, and held the same language 13 » 1883 - to him as that contained in the note addressed to Musurus Pasha on the 5th July. Mr. Wyndham subsequently handed to the Mr. Wyndham, Porte a memorandum basing the company's CommetciAl rights of navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates July 25,1883. upon the agreement of 1846, It was asserted in this memorandum that, in order to remove any doubt as to the right of British vessels to navi gate those rivers for purposes of trade, the Porte notified the arrangement by Imperial order in a vizierial letter dated the 2nd April, 1846, to the Pasha of Bagdad, and that the order recognised the right of f&lt; les batiments anglais' to ply for trade, and fixed the duties to be paid by sea-goiusf vessels and by vessels trading between different localities on the rivers ('un commerce int^rieur'). Musurus Pasha communicated semi-offlcially Aaria Pasha to to Lord Granville on the 24th July the Turkish ^ u8uru8 Pasha, reply to the British representations. From this (AppfndUXIZ) communication it appeared that after examination the Porte had found that two successive Imperial finnans - conferred on the company upon certain defined conditions the privilege of navigating he Euphrates alone by two steam vessels in turn. Jhese documents, it was stated, were the on y bases of the immunity granted to the company, and the right of navigation of the Euphrates alone constituted an important and exceptional privilege since it was contrary to all usage an precedent that the navigation of the tate. The Porte argued that the vizierial letters of 184a and 1861 were only expressed in genera terms, and did not mention cLariv and pre cist y t ie right of navigation on the Tigris but O. iorcign mably tho8e of 1834 and 1841.34 : To Mr. Wyndham, No. 118, Commercial, July 24, 1883. Musurus Pasha, August 3, 1883. [Confidential 4852.] To Lord Dufferin, No. 222, Commercial, December 13, 1883.

Musurus Pasha stated that the Porte intended to maintain in their full integrity the privileges conferred on the company within the limits of the stipulations of the firmans mentioned; but he pointed out that the vizierial letter of 1861 referred to the privileges under those firmans as being conferred subject to the proviso ' that it were proved and established that the advantages resulting therefrom would be mutual; and that no sort of inconvenience would ensue.' Pending further discussion, orders were issued by the Porte temporarily revoking the measures taken by the Bagdad authorities against the company's steamers. Interview's took place at the Foreign Office between the Turkish Ambassador and the Perma nent and Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State for the purpose of arriving at an amicable solution of the navigation question, but led to no practical result; and Musurus Pasha, being invited to state the Turkish case in writing, formally recapitulated the Porte's arguments in a note dated the 28th December, 1883. In this communication he maintained that the sole ri^ht of navigation possessed by the company was derived from the firmans of 1834 and 1^41, which restricted them to the navigation of the Euphrates only, and limited the number of vessels to be employed to two. He denied that a general right of navigation of the Mcsopo- tamian rivers had ever been granted to British vessels; and argued that, if the vizierial letters of 1846 and 1861 had been intended to concede a general right of navigation, the reference to the firmans of 1834 and 1841 in the vizierial letter of 1861 would have been superfluous; that it was impossible to hold that such a right could be accorded by simple vizierial letters; that it must necessarily have formed the subject of a treaty, the benefit of which could be claimed by Powers entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment; and that the vizierial letters had no reference to British ships entitled to carry the British flag, but only to British-owned native craft which improperly carried the British flag^ and thus escaped payment of dues. Musurus Pasha further contended that the object of the64 Tizierial letters was only to Accord the decision of the Porte that British-owned ^native craft might continue to navigate the rivers on payment of the same dues as vessels belonging to Ottoman subjects, and stated' that these boats had so continued to navigate, subject to such payment, and without carrying the British Hag. Hie report of the 44 Hotel des Monnaies ' referred to in the vizierial letter of 1846 was only intended, he said, to lay down that native craft owned by foreigners engaged in the internal trade must pay the same dues as vessels owned by Ottoman subjects and engaged in the same internal trade, and was not intended to decide the question whether British vessels had the right to navigate the rivers, such a question not being within the competence of that Department. Owing to the vague terms of the vizierial letters there had been confusion, he asserted, on the part of Her Majesty's Government between British vessels entitled to carry the British flag and British-owned native vessels, and they had placed on those letters an interpretation as erroneous as it was inadmissible. It was held that the arguments adduced by To Law Officers, Musurus Pasha on behalf of the Porte gave rise f vppendlx^xxi) 84 * to three questions:— 1. Whether there was, in fact, such an agree ment in 1S46 as was recorded in Sir S. Canning's No. 45 of the 18th March, 1846. 2. If so whether Her Majesty's Government were precluded by the course of action followed since that date, as well as by insufficiency of evidence and conflict of interpretation, from claiming the benefit of that agreement. 3. hether (assuming the 1846 agreement to be abandoned) the vizierial letter of January 1861 and the enjoyment by the company for twenty-two years without protest of the privilege of navigating the Tigris and Euphrates were evidence of an agreement by the Porte to the establishment of the company's two steamers on those rivers. As regards the first question it was noted that, although Sir S. Canning's account of the agreement of 1846 was clear and unambiguous there was no evidence of the agreement- beyond his despatch No. 45 of the 18th March 1846 and the vizierial letters of 1846 and 1861 the interpretation of which was disputed. More- * Evidence of the agreement is given on pages 15-20.65 over, no British vessels had navigated the rivers in pursuance of the agreement since it was made. There seemed to be, therefore, insuperable difficulty in establishing the agreement as against the Porte. It was further noted that the Law Officers had answered the second question in 1881 adversely to the claim of Her Majesty's Govern ment. In the reply to the Turkish Ambassador it was not thought necessary to abandon Her Majesty's Government's claim under the agree ment of 1846, but to advance considerations in support of it. The main contention, however, on the part of Her Majesty's Government was that, whatever might be the true construction of the agreement as to the general risrht of naviga tion, the Porte's attitude during the foregoing twenty-two years debarred them from disputing the validity of rights claimed and exercised by the company under the vizierial letter of 1861, and that the British Government were entitled to insist on the status quo of the company being maintained. Law-officers, Correspondence touching the right claimed by (Appendix XXIII.) Ottoman Government to stop the company's traffic was submitted to the Law Officers, and they reported that the Turkish Ambassador's note of the 3rd August might properly be answered on the lines indicated in the preceding paragraph. They added that, in the light of fuller information before them with reference to the extent to which navigation on the Tigris existed prior to 1846 and otherwise, the vizierial letter of 1846 appeared to them to afford more evidence in support of the arrangement arrived at than when their report of 1881 was made. The position of the British Government seemed to them strohger than they previously considered it to be, though the difficulties arising from the action of the Constantinople Embassy subsequent to 1846 still remained. To Law Officers, Papers relating (1) to the rumoured desire of Appendix XXII.) Bagdad authorities to settle the matters in dispute by buying up the company, and (2) to the claims of the company to compensation for losses sustained through the Porte's action in stopping their traffic, were also submitted to the Law Officers. On these points the Law Officers advised as to (1) that a communication to the Porte was not necessary as sanction had only been given to the formation of an Ottoman company , on condition that it did not infringe the English [163—1]66 company's rights, and as to (2) that action to enforce the company 's claims should bo postponed until an understanding on the main question had been arrived at. To explain the change of view adopted by the Law Officers as regards the agreement of 1846, it is necessary to refer to the ' fuller information afforded to them, which was apparently supplied in the following memoranda :— 1. Memorandum (Mr. Kennedy), the 20th July, 1883, Confidential, 4838. Mr. Kennedy (then head of the Commercial Department of the Foreign Office) in the course of his memorandum discussed the firman of 1834 and the arrangement of 1846, and referred to Consul-General Rawlinson's statement (1845) that boats under the British flag had navigated the river (presumably the Shatt-el-Arab and the Tigris up to Bagdad) for forty years, and to the company's statement (20th May, 1880) that in 1846 the firm of Messrs. S. Lynch and Co., and others, both Persian and Indian subjects, possessed boats of 150 to 200 tons burden navigating the rivers. He remarked that the Porte, as well as the local authorities, had sought to pass over the agreement of 1846, and to make the British right of navigation dependent on the firman of 1834, to which view the company had not been averse, because by running together the arrangements of 1834 and 1846 they were able to claim a monopoly of navigation as against other foreign vessels. He concluded his memo randum by suggesting (a) in reference to the firmans and vizierial letters issued by the Porte that the distinction between the Euphrates and Tigris as separate rivers was a western idea and did not exist in local nomenclature, and (6) that the facts of the case as shown in the whole correspondence and by long usage were not full y before the Law Officers in 1881. 2. Memorandum (Mr. Plowden), 31st Julv 1883, Confidential 4838, p. 17. Mr Plowden 's memorandum was drawn up in the form of observations on Mr. Kennedy's memorandum. He contended that the firmans «n 18 ' ( ' 1 '' ''' d » with the Chesney expedition and the other for the secunty of Captain Lynch when two of67 Chesney's steamers were retained on the Euphrates after the expedition was broken up) had no bearing upon the general right of naviga tion of the r l igris by British vessels, which was based upon— (a.) The usage for many years prior to 1846; (b.) The terms of the 1846 arrangement, con firmed and renewed in 1861 and 1862; and (c.) The usage of the past twenty years. Mr. Plowden maintained that the arrangement of 1846 was, and had been maintained at the time to be, a formal agreement issued under the direct authority of the Sultan, whereby the usage of the past was acknowledged and its future continuance sanctioned under certain definite conditions agreed to by both parties. As regards the distinction between the Euphrates and Tigris, Mr. Plowden did not think that any inhabitant of Mesopotamia could possibly confuse the two streams. 3. Memorandum (Lord E. Eitzmaurice), 18th August, 1883. This memorandum gave the substance of the conversation between the Turkish Ambassador and Sir J. Pauncefote and Lord E. Fitzmaurice at an interview at the Eoreign Office on the 15th August, 1883, in the course of which Musurus Pasha advanced the contentions and arguments which were subsequently embodied in his note of the 28th December, 1883, when he formally stated in writing the Turkish case. When recording the position taken up by Musurus Pasha respecting the arrangement of 1846, Lord E. Eitzmaurice remarked that there could be no doubt that the terms of Sir S. Canning's despatch were a loose rendering of the terms of the vizierial letter, and that the latter, not the former, was our title-deed; but he claimed that the vizierial letter of 1846 was not to be limited by reference to the firmans of 1834 and 1841. He further observed that British vessels had since 1846, and even before that date, been allowed to navigate the Tigris, which fact constituted a usage, and he was inclined 'to base the British case on that usage rather than on the dubious terms of the letter of 1846, and the still more dubious geography of the letter of 1861, or on the free translation of the letter of 1846 by Sir S. Canning.' f68 4. Memorandum (Sir L. -felly), Confidential 4838, pp. 15 and 16. This' memorandum gave a statement of the case on behalf of the Euphrates and 1 igris Steam Navigation Company! Sir L. Pelly asserted that 'before and since the Sublime Porte held autho rity over the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, British vessels had been free to navigate those rivers,' and mentioned that prior to 1846, when vessels under the British flag navigated the rivers exempt from all dues, Messrs. Hector and Co. and other British firms owned vessels on the Tigris and plied commercially between Bussorah and Bagdad under the British Hag. Amongst other papers, in addition to the memoranda referred to in the foregoing para graphs submitted to the Law Officers were copies of Sir S. Canning's despatches (with enclosures) Nos. 45 and 53, ISth March and 4th April, 1846, (Appendices IX relating to the navigation of the Tigris and an ^ XL) Euphrates and to the agreement on the subject come to with the Porte.' These despatches were apparently not communicated to the Law Officers in 1881, although they explained the circum stances in which the arrangement was made and the \izieriai letter of 1846 issued. In the note addressed to Musurus Pasha on To Musurus Pash* reply t0 hi8 notc ' of the (-Wx xkv.) 28th December, 1883, he was informed that Her Majesty's Government did not agree to his statement of the facts of the ease, or to the interpretation he sought to place on the docu ments relating to it. It was pointed out to him that the firmans of 1831 and 1841 had no refer ence to the steamers of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, hut only to two St rT ment Steamer8 Which were autho- nsed by the firmans to ply on the Euphrates, but had ceased to navigate that river long before the company was established; and it was maintained from the record of the arrangement of 18 46 contained m Sir S j date that tho • . . , b s ^ es P a ^hes of that * , . tlle vmerial ktter of the 2nd April 1846, had been addressed to the vali in execution of an agreement arrived at between Sir S r and approved b 7 tlem. TCndixXm.) 0 the Law 0fflcOT869 concerning the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates by British vessels and the payment of dues in the internal trade. Attention was called to the wording of the vizierial letters of 1846 and 3861, relative to the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates by British vessels, which was shown to be inexplicable if Musurus Pasha's interpreta tion of the letters were accepted, but, on the other hand, was entirely consistent with the agreement recorded in Sir S. Canning's des patches in 1846. With regard to the contention of Musurus Pasha that such an agreement as that of 1846 could not be concluded otherwise than by a treaty, it was observed that the agreement would not be the less valid as an international agreement because the Porte did not think fit to give effect to it by an Imperial firman or to insist on making it the subject of a formal treaty. Her Majesty's Government held that they were not necessarily called upon to invoke the general right of navigation claimed by them on the Tigris and Euphrates, but as the vizierial letter of 1861 conferred on the company the privilege of placing their two steamers on the rivers, and as the company had enjoyed the privilege ever since with the knowledge and acquiescence of the Porte, Her Majesty's Govern ment considered that they were entitled to insist upon the rights hitherto enjoyed by the company being respected and maintained. Daring the course of a debate in the House of Commons on the 8th August, 188 4-, the language employed in the note of the 6th June to Musurus Pasha, respecting the privilege conferred on the company by the vizierial letter of 1861 to place their steamers on the Tigris and Euphrates, was repeated by the Under-Secretaiy of State for Eoreign Affairs. The statement in each instance was thus worded :— 'Her Majesty's Government contend that the vizierial letter of 1861, having been issued for the very purpose of enabling the company to put their two steamers on the Tigris and Euphrates, was intended to confer and did confer, that privilege on them.' No further objection to the navigation of the Tigris by the company's steamers was then made by the Turkish authorities, and the incident appears to have been regarded as closed. [163—1] TIn November 1886, however, the company urged that their claim to compensation for the losses they had sustained by the stoppage ol their traffic in 1883 should be pressed upon the Porte, but were informed that, so far as Iler Majesty's Government were aware, the company had no rights binding upon the Turkish Government upon which a claim for compensation could b( based. In addition to compensation for losses sus tained in 1883, the company claimed compensa tion for an attack made by Arabs upon their steamer 'Khalifah ' in 1880, and for the inter ference with their barges in 1881. In connection with the 4&lt; Khalifah' incident, it had been proposed to send a British gun-boat up the Tigris, and a memorandum was prepared by Sir E. Hertslet as to the right of British ships of war to go up the Tigris and Euphrates. In this memorandum he stated that there was no clause in any of our treaties with Turkey either per mitting or prohibiting the passage of British ships of war up those rivers, but, although the right of navigating the rivers and canals of the Ottoman Empire under the British flag was not secured to British subjects by treaty, the Porte apparently had never officially announced that British ships of war were prohibited from visiting the internal waters of the Empire. He referred to the correspondence of 1874 respecting the ' Philomel' incident, and to Sir H. Elliot's despatch of the 22nd Eebruary, 1875 (see p. 41), relative to the ' Comet,' in which the latter stated that he had been careful not to claim for Her Majesty's Government a right to station a mau-of-war in the inland waters of Turkey. It was decided, after consideration of Sir E Hertslet's memorandum, to drop the proposal to send a gun-boat to the Tigris. A communication was subsequently made by the Porte to the embassy at Constantinople to the effect that foreign ships of war had hitherto only gone up e nver as far as Kurna after having applied for and obtained authorisation from the Turkish authorities, and the Ambassador was requested to take measures to ensure that British ships of war 's abstiennent de remonter le fleuve au- coTfiTt 6 Courna alia d ' 6viter t0Ute ^ de The Porte's request was referred to the Admiralty and India Office, and it was agreed Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, November 15, 1886.

Consul-General Plowden's opinion had been asked for, with reference to the Porte's com munication referred to above, on the question of the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab by foreign ships of war. He thought that the whole question at issue had been conceded by the Porte in the phrase ' de remonter le fleuve au-dessus de Courna,' as it was not possible for men-of- war of the class usually visiting Bussorah to ascend the Shatt-el-Arab for any appreciable distance beyond Kurna, and none had, so far as he could ascertain, ever done so; but he sug gested that probably the word Kurna had been wrongly substituted for Bussorah. Although it was desirable that British ships of war visiting Bussorah from time to time should have full liberty to proceed as far as Kurna,* he considered that this measure alone would not suffice to protect British commerce on the Lower Tigris, and put forward the suggestion that the &lt;f Comet,'f which had been recognised in the Porte's npte of the 10th July, 1869, as ' un batiment de la marine Boy ale,' should be replaced by a vessel of the Royal Navy. Lord Dufferin proposed, and his proposal was ap- January 3 1882 proved, to inform the Porte that there was no question of British men-of-war ascending above Kurna, and to wait a more favourable oppor tunity for obtaining the Sultan's consent to Mr. Plowden's suggestion as to stationing a Queen's ship at Bagdad.

The vessel was completed in 1881, but was found on account of its excessive draught to be unsuitable for employment on the Tigris and Euphrates. Another one was built, and in 1884 the old ' Comet' was broken up and an irade issued authorising the employment in its place of the new vessel, also called the 'Comet.'

Lord Dufferin, No. 4,72 Majesty's Government were not aware of any regulation precluding them from visiting Bus- sorah. Later in the same year the Turkish Ambassador again called attention to the presence of a British man-of-war at Bussorah, and it was explained to him that the vessel had probably f,a8lla gone there to convey to his post the official September 12, sent to take charge of the consulate. In connection with the stoppage of the Euphrates Mr. Wyndham, and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's steamers, Cnmmercial the Porte complained that there had been a ^ 188 3. threat to send a British gun-boaf :i ' to the Shatt- el-Arab, and implied that it would be better to prohibit the running of the company 's steamers rather than incur the risk of such a contingency. The charge d'affaires at Constan tinople informed the Turkish Ministers that the idea had emanated from the consul-general at Bagdad with reference to the danger from Arab attacks incurred by the company's steamers, and assured them that, if the Ottoman Government looked upon such a course as a violation of the law of nations. Her Majesty's Government had too much respect for the Sultan's Government to adopt any measure which could be considered as such. re !r mi xf the narrative of events in Lord Dufferiu, 0 arc o ie Euphrates and Tigris Steam 6 ' Navigation steamers, it should be mentioned 15,1882 - that, during the period 1882-84, attempts were made without success by various foreign nations to obtain permission to place steamers on the Port^ ! n L Wyndham SU SS es te&lt;i that the Mr. Wyadham. , r n rar ^ actl0 n in respect of the com- Na 200 ' 1 pany s steamers mi^ht hp x i .

A project for the formation of an Ottoman company to navigate the rivers of Mesopotamia was also put forward in 1883, and in 1884 Consul-General Plowden reported to the embassy at Constantinople that the Bagdad Government was endeavouring to start a Turkish company for the navigation of the rivers, their plan, including the compulsory purchase of the com pany's steamers. The Governor-General of Bagdad was informed by the Central Govern ment that the Porte were willing to consent to tbe formation of the company on condition that it should be composed of Ottoman subjects, and that the concession did not encroach on the privileges of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. This matter, as has already been mentioned (see p. 65), was referred to the Law Officers, who did not consider a communication to the Porte to be neces sary. No action, therefore, was taken by the Poreign Office, and nothing further respecting the proposed Turkish company was reported home. It may here be remarked, with reference to the number of Turkish steamers then on the Tigris, that the Vali of Bagdad mentioned that there were seven Oman Ottoman steamers. This statement was made during the stoppage of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany's steamers at a time when the Turkish authorities proposed that the British mails on the Tigris should be conveyed by the vessels of the Oman Ottoman Navigation Bureau. When the prohibition of traffic on the Tigris was withdrawn in August 1883 the company proposed to make use of the three steamers and the barges which they had on the river, but were informed that, pending the settlement with the Porte of the questions then at issue. Her Majesty's Government were of opinion that they must confine their operations on the Tigris and Euphrates to two steam-vessels, and must not employ barges. [163—1] U74 As bearing on the amount of traffic to be dealt with, the company pointed out that in 1860 the Navigation ocean trade to Bussorah was carried by a few 188 3 &gt; sailing vessels, numbering not more than about two or three square-rigged ships from India and four from Europe in the course of the year; whereas in 1883 there were large steamers about every five days between Bussorah and India, and every week or ten days to Europe—in other words, that the traffic had increased twenty times; and in this connection they hoped that the unrestricted right of navigation by British vessels of all kinds would be insisted upon. Subsequently, at the request of the company, Mr. Wyndham, the Porte were asked to permit them to use their ^ommeTcial new barge on the Tigris as a depot for landing December 21, and receiving cargo. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs refused the application, and hoped the company would rest satisfied with the privilege they were then enjoying to the exclusion of all foreign competitors. Mr. Wyndham con sidered it advisable not to reopen the question of the navigation of the Tigris by pressing the To Mr. Wynham, matter, and Lord Granville concurred in this view. .Unuarf '''IsaT'' The company, however, explained that their Euphrates and steamers had been driven from the wharves at ? team t&gt; j j / l . i . Navigation ±&gt;agaaa (which were entirely taken up by Turkish Company, steamers), and consequently, owing to the insuffi- January 16 ' 1885 - ciency of wharfage accommodation, they were compelled to use barges for loading and discharging cargo and passengers. For this purpose they had. ordered up a barge from Bussorah (empty, and tracked by hand, in order to avoid dispute with the authorities), which, however, had been stopped by Turkish officials at * Kurna. Mr. Wyndham was instructed to make representations on the subject to the Turkish Government, and addressed a note verba!e to the Mr. Wyndlmm, Porte on the 6th February, 1885, in which he n 0 ' H ' ■ . as ed that the company should be permitted to FeSmryV/lSSS. use heir barge for the purpose specified, or to build at their own expense a bonded whart for the use of their steamer.. Failing compliance, he suggested that the custom-house at Bagdad .shou d be enlarged, and ■ instructions issued to enable the company's steamers to have a proper Sen 1 n Vvharfa S e accommodation Incidentally he mentioned that he was not aware bv Z7T reSUlati0n Pr0hibiting the to «mg aM empty barge ll ' 0ln Bussorah to75 The Porte replied in a note verhale dated the 24!th September, 1885, denying that the wharf accommodation at Bagdad was inadequate, and refusing to allow the company to use a barge at Bagdad as desired, or to build a bonded ware house there. The following passages occur in this note:— 'Messrs. Lynch are authorised by Imperial firman only to have two steamers on the Euphrates; the Sublime Porte cannot allow them to keep on the Tigria a barge which could easily be converted into a steamer. . . . . Though the express condition of their firman allows them to keep two vessels on the Euphrates, they have extended their service to the Tigris, constantly seek to increase their fleet, and actually style them selves unduly ' Tigris and Euphrates Navigation Company.' . . . Sir P. Currie, No. 408, June 21, 1897.* The embassy, after consulting Mr. Plowden^ considered it inadvisable to take any action which would result in reopening the Tigris navigation question, and the matter was allowed to drop. An interesting question arose in 1884-85 relative to the carriage of local letters by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany's steamers. The Ottoman Postal Depart ment contended that the company ' were bound by rule ' to carry Turkish mails, but the latter declined on principle to admit the right claimed by the Ottoman Post Office, although willing to meet the former's views and come to an amicable arrangement. Finally, in consideration of the removal of the opposition to the discharging and August 20, 1885. loading of their steamers at the Bagdad custom house, the company agreed to convey Turkish mails to Kiit, Amarah, and Bussorah, and vice- versa, and this arrangement was carried into effect. Musurus Pasha, Musurus Pasha complained, in May, 1885, May 18, 1885. ^ &lt;&lt; (j onie t ' (new), which had been autho rised by the Porte in the previous year to be stationed at Bagdad, had proceeded up the Tigris beyond that place as far as Samarra, ' Ce fait,'* he said, ' etant sans precedent et d^passant To Musurus Pasha, Tautorisation accordee.' It was explained to July 11,1880 kijn that the 'Comet' had been employed to &gt; convey the consul at Bagdad up the river on a tour of his consular district, and regret was ex pressed that the Ottoman Government should * No trace can be found in the correspondence of the Porte's reply having been sent home by the Embassy in 1885. Sir W. White, No. 258, May 5, 1885. Sir W. White, No. 104, Commercial,76 take exception to such a proceeding. Musurus pasha brought back the note of explanation and asked that one less curtly worded should be sub stituted. The note was accordingly amended, and concluded with the expression of Her Majesty's Government's hope that no opposition would 'be made to the ' stationnaire' of the consulate ascending the river for the same pur pose, providing notice were previously given to the local authorities. Temporary permission to tow barges during the prevalence of famine at Bagdad was given to Commercial, the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company in 1887,* but was only in iorce for a few months. The company had previously applied to the Foreign Office with a view to obtaining permission from the Porte for employ ment of their third steamer and four barges, and were informed that, in the opinion of Her To Euphrates and Majesty's Government, it was undesirable to 1 reopen the question of the use of barges or to Company, , . , . • • p i • April 9, 1886. take any action to obtain permission for their third steamer to run on the Mesopotamian rivers. In consequence of the accumulation of cargo at Euphrates and Bussorah, the company again urged that action tion™ should be taken on their behalf, or that they Company, should be compensated for their losses by Her j^ f) enilier lo ' Majesty's Government. They were told that To Euphrates land any attempt to obtain increased facilities would ' ri ^ I ! ls ^a 111 , . . Mavigatiou! not be likely to meet with success; that Her Company, Majesty's Government were not aware of any act i^ G ember 2 ^ binding upon the Turkish Government giving the company rights in the matter; and that their claim against Her Majesty's Government for compensation in the event of the company's case not being pressed could not be recognised. Towards the end of 1886 it was reported that a canal (Dujailah Canal) was in course of con struction, for irrigation purposes, near Kut-el- Amarab, on the Tigris between Bagdad and Bussorah, and fear was entertained that the navigation of the Tigris would be detrimentally affected by its waters being drawn off. The Ambassador at Constantinople was directed to ToSirW wv. call the Porte's attention to this danger and No - 85, * ' about seventeen months later fresh representa- NovemWs i tions were made by Sir W.

These works included the cutting of the Hillah Channel and the erection of the Hindieh Canal barrage. Schemes for the navigation of the Euphrates by Turkish vessels had been mooted from time Consul-General to time, and in 1890 the Porte were reported to Tweedie ISfo 11 Commercial, ' under consideration a project for the July 29,1890. establishment of a regular Turkish steam-ship # service on that river. Early the following year Mr. G. Mackenzie, ^r. Mackenzie (afterwards Sir G. Mackenzie) February &gt;, 1891. submitted to the Foreign Office a draft conces sion, which he stated had been approved privately at Constantinople, for the exclusive right of working river steamers and barges on the Tigris and Euphrates to any navigable point, as well as on the Shatt-el-Arab. It was proposed that a Turkish company should be formed to work the concession and that the ships of the company should fly the Ottoman flag and be manned by Turks, though officered by Englishmen. Sir W. Sir W. White, White remarked, in reference to this concession, ' 4 ' orr ion n that it was in accordance with the Turkish design February 27.1891. _ 0 to drive the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Naviga tion Company's steamers off the river. In the following year the company referred to the reported formation of a Turkish company at Bagdad, whose shares were to be exclusively held by Ottoman subjects. In view of the re strictions placed upon the employment of their two steamers, the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company considered that they would be at a disadvantage in competing with the vessels of the new company, and feared that they would not be able to carry on their service. They asked, therefore, that the Porte should be urged to remove those restrictions, specified as follows:— 1. Restriction to use of two steamers only. 2. Prohibition of navigation of the Euphrates and of the Tigris above Bagdad. 3. Prohibition of towing of barges. They also desired permission to employ a small steamer or ' bateau mouche ' (see vizierial letter [163—1] X Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, August 9 and September 27, 1892.78 of the 31st March, 1875) in place of one oi their other steamers when necessary. This application* was referred to the Ambas- Jo Sr C. Ford,, sador at Constantinople with instructions to October 10, 1892. represent the matter to the Porte, and to express Her Majesty's Government's hope that the com pany would be placed on a footing of equality with any Turkish company which might be formed, or, failing such treatment, to urge that the extension of powers desired should be granted to the English company. At the same time the and company were informed &lt;that Her Majesty's Navigation Oovernment could not as of right claim extension 1892. of their privileges. Sir Clare Eord replied that the new Turkish J ir ^■ Q f ord ' x yo. odo, company, the shares of which were in the hands November 7,1892, of the Sultan and Palace officials,! had apparently been formed with the express object of driving the English company's boats off the river, and there was no prospect of obtaining an extension of the latter company's privileges unless strong pressure were brought to bear on the Porte. He further remarked that he could only insist on the faithful observance of firmans already granted, which contained no clause granting a monopolv to the English company or guaranteeing facilities equal to those accorded to Ottoman, subjects. In answer to his despatch Sir C. Ford was To Sir C. Ford, informed that the rights which could be claimed November 25 for British vessels to navigate the Tigris and 1892 - Euphrates were defined in the firman of 1834 and the vizierial letters of 1842 (1841), 1846, and 1861, and he was instructed to insist, when the irad6 sanctioning the new Turkish company was issued, on two British merchant-vessels being allowed to navigate the rivers without limit as to extent of navigation or dates of voyages, and without being subjected to the payment of higher dues than those mentioned in the vizierial letters of 1846 and 1861, Messrs.

He was also instructed to claim the right of the two British steamers to tow barges or other craft not under British colours. Sir C. Pord was informed that to secure the objects mentioned it would be necessary to amend the pro-memorid which it was proposed to append to article 16 of the draft commercial treaty with Turkey then under negotiation, by striking out from it the specific reference to Messrs. Lynch's company, the limitation of navigation to the river between Bussorah and Bagdad, and the restriction of tlie service to ' un voyage bihebdomadaire.' (The question of this pro-meinorid has been dealt with on page 80 and following pages.) Sir C. Pord reported that the irade sanctioning the new Turkish company had been issued, but that there was no immediate prospect of their boats being placed on the rivers, as one vessel had foundered, and the other was employed at Constantinople. At the same time he submitted memoranda by Mr. Block (consul and interpreter at Constantinople) and Mr. Wrench (employed in the commercial negotiations with Turkey) relative to the instructions given in foreign Office despatch No. 250 of the 25th November, 1892. Mr. Block observed that Bagdad had been regarded since 1831 as the limit for navigation by British vessels, and stated that the Porte would oppose the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates without limit by the company's vessels. He thought that no objections might be raised in regard to the dates of voyages, and that there was nothing to fear for the moment with respect to dues, but, as it had never been satisfactorily settled that the firman (1834) and vizierial letter (1861) conferred on the company the permanent right to navigate the rivers, he considered it injudicious to make representations implying doubt respecting British rights. He further pointed out that the Porte had hitherto refused to recognise the claim to tow barges, and no documents had been produced to show that the company possessed such a right, and that, moreover, permission to tow barges would be acquired if the pro-memorid to be appended to article 16 of the proposed commercial treaty were maintained. Mr. Wrench in his memo randum suggested that a proposal to amend the pro-memorid might lead the Porte to examine in80 a critical spirit the exact extent of rights conferred upon Mr. Lynch {i.e., the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company) aud the conditions attached to the privileges eiijo\(d, and the examination might show that those rights had been too liberally interpreted in the pro-memorid, and that the conditions had been altogether forgotten. With respect to the instructions to strike out specific reference to the company in order that the permission accorded should be extended to the British flag in general, Mr. Wrench referred to the demand already made in the course of the commercial treaty negotiations (Confidential 6158, pp. 20 and 34) to secure the right of navigation to the British flag, and rejected by the Turkish commissioner, who would only admit that the exclusive privilege accorded to Mr. Lynch personally should be prolonged. The substance of Sir C. Ford's despatch and enclosures above mentioned was communicated to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, and they were informed that it was not proposed to move further in the matter. It is necessary and convenient to give here the history of the pro-Tnemorid referred to in the preceding paragraphs, and an account of Article 1G of the proposed commercial treat v. It was to Article] 6, 'Cabotage' Article, that the ■pro-memorid was appended. Hip Anglo-Turkish commercial treaty of 1861 was denounced by the Porte in October 1882, and terminated in October of the following year. Negotiations were carried on from that date to arrange a tariff for British imports kto Turkey and to conclude a new commercial treaty, and in 1890 Messrs. Law and Wrench were appointed as British delegates to negotiate a treaty of com merce and navigation. They experienced difficulty i„ persuading their Ottoman col- eagues to accept the word ' navigation' in ' existed * the treaty of 1861 (Article 1), and Sir W.

White, No. 137, Commercial, October 29, 1890. Enclosure in Sir W. White, No. 21, Commercial, February 20, 1891. With a view to obtaining reasonable freedom for coasting trade to be carried on by British vessels in Turkish waters, Sir W. White had previously proposed that an article respecting u cabotage should be inserted in the new treaty. The cabotage question was discussed by the British and Ottoman delegates, and, when' reporting proposals on the subject made by the latter, Messrs. Law and Wrench suggested, as one of the conditions of acceptance, that certain desirable facilities for Messrs. Lynch's xvaviga- tion Company should be formally guaranteed.' Sir W. White, observing that he was desirous to render secure the rights of navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates possessed by the company, recommended that Mr. Lynch should be com municated with on the subject, and Mr. Law, one of the British delegates, was deputed to interview the directors of the company, who informed him that they would be glad to have tbeir rights of navigation On the rivers specifically confirmed in connection with the new treaty, and at the same time obtain the privilege of running a third steamer and towing barges. Mr. Law thought that a satisfactory declaration might be obtained from the Ottoman delegates definitely confirming the rights exercised on Tigris and Euphrates, with a slight extension of those privileges, but he considered (evidently having in mind the firman of 1834) that, as the navigation privileges were originally granted to the Govern ment,, it would be advisable in any reference to the question to speak of British ships, and not to mention any particular company. SirW'. White was instructed that steps should be taken to carry out Mr. Law's suggestions, but, failing discussion by the delegates, he was told to urge them upon the Porte. At the twenty-second meeting of the delegates, held on the 17th February, 1891, the question of the privileges enjoyed by Messrs. Lynch's Navi gation Company ' and formerly accorded to the Indian Government,' was raised in connection with Article 16 ('cabotage') of the treaty. The Turkish delegates objected to the mention in any way of the Government in connection with these exceptional privileges, as such mention might lead to undesirable complications with other Powers under the most -favoured-nation clause, but they were prepared to discuss the subject as regards the private company. [163—1] Y82 Article 16 ('cabotage') was signed ad ^ U ll ' e ' referendum by the British and Ottoman dele- Commercial, gates on the' 6th March, 1891, and dealt with &gt;1^ 28,1891 the navigation of lakes and rivers in the following terms:— 4&lt; Quant a la navigation des lacs et fleuves, elle est ^galement reservee an pavilion ottoman. Par exception, le port de la ville de Basgorali sera, comme le passe, toujours ouvert la navigation anglaise. En outre, ies ports et villes qui se trouvent a une distance n'excedant pas 15 kilom. de la mer seront consideres comme ports de mer ouverts ^ la navigation anglaise.' Before siarninsj this article the British dele- British Delegates , i j j + r -n c • to Sir W. \V bite, gates demanaen a document explicitly connrming March 8, 1891 the rights under which the steamers of the (Enclosure 3 in ftlx )V6 )• Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany plied between Bussorah and Bagdad, and a pro-memorid was drafted clearly defining the then existing privileges as including a bi-weekly service, the employment of a third vessel as a ' bateau de rechange,' and the towim? of barges. The Ottoman delegates pressed strongly for the adoption of such wording as would have limited the enjoyment of all privileges to Mr. Lynch, but the British delegates w^ould not admit that the rights in question had been conferred on Mr. Lynch personally, and argued that the rights were general for a bi-weekly service, which was then maintained by Lynch's company. Pin ally, the Ottoman delegates agreed to recognise the rights as general for a service of steamers, providing it were specified by whom the service was performed, such specification being in their opinion necessary to prevent the possible claimin- Ot similar privileges hy other Powers under the most-favoured-nation clause.

It is to be observed that the pro-memorid was appended to article 16, but did not form part of the treaty, and Sir 0. Eord pointed out, in the course of observations on the article and its annexes, that it would be necessary to obtain from the Porte a formal note respecting Messrs. Lynch's company before the treaty was signed. Instructions were issued to the Ambas sador to the effect that article 16 might be accepted under certain conditions, one of which was that a definite and written agreement should be come to with the Porte with regard to Messrs. Lynch's steamers between Bussorah and Bagdad. Another condition to the acceptance of article 16 was that any restriction or prohibition which might be made as regards petit cabotage ' should be enforced against all foreigners alike. Sir 0. Eord remarked on the subject of ' cabo tage ' that the position taken up by Her Majesty's Government was based on the Capitulations and more modern treaties and usage, and he briefly described the distinction made by the Porte between ' grand cabotage' and 'petitcabotage.' According to the Turkish view the former—in which British right to participate was not challenged — consisted in the landing and embarking of goods and passengers in the ports of Marmora, Dardanelles, and other inland waters of Turkey, by sea-going vessels which left an Ottoman port bound for a foreign port, or which came from a foreign port to a port of discharge in the Ottoman Empire ; whilst the latter consisted in conveying goods and pas sengers by a service carried on by small boats, that never visited a foreign port, between one port and another in the waters, and especially in the territorial waters, of Turkey. The Porte held as regards ' petit cabotage ' that they had the power by international right to reserve to the national flag the coasting trade in the gulfs, bays, straits, and internal waters of the Ottoman Empire. Article 16 recognised this Turkish distinction between 'grand cabotage' and petit cabotage'; British right to participate in the former was not questioned, but British ships were excluded as regards the latter from the Straits, the Sea of Marmora, and enclosed terri torial waters, such as ' the Gulf of Smyrna, (fcc.,' though not from other points of the Turkish coast-line.84 rt of the British dele- ^ S; ! l ' ,or(1, ing Lynch's company, and had also objected to paragraph 4 ol^ article 16 granting Ireedom of navigation to river ports not more t han 15 kilom. from the sea; but Messrs. Wrench and Block informed their Turkish colleagues that the article with its pro-memorid formed one indivisible whole, and contained the only conditions on which any modifications of the views held as to the rights of Her Majesty's Government to coasting trade in Turkish waters- could be entertained. Negotiations relative to the commercial treaty were suspended, but in 1901, when it was pro posed to resume them, Messrs. Lvnch were asked Sir N. O'Conor, 'Vo G r ) if the pro-memorid attached to article 16 suffi- Commercial, ciently defined their privileges, and replied that Jul y 25 ' l901 * in their opinion it did not accurately express the rights of navigation which they enjoyed on the Tigris. The text of the pro-memorid was there fore amended, and inserted under paragraph 11 (subsequently paragraph 3) of the final protocol attached to the new draft of the treaty (in which the ' cabotage ' article became article 18). The amended text was worded as follows :— ' 11 est entendu que les reserves faites ad referendum pai les delegues ottomans et aecepteesac? referendum par les delegues britauniques au sujet de la navigation dans les fleuves (voir article 18, relatif an cabotage) ne concernent pas le service effectuc par la compagnie Lynch entre Bassorah et Bagdad en vertu des autoriea- tions speciales de la Sublime Porte selon lesquelies la compagnie maintient un service bihebdomadaire de bateaux a vapeur remorquant des mahonnes entre les villes ci-dessus mentionnees.' Negotiations were again susnended. flnrl TTio Comet' (' in Sir W. White, No. 372, September 3,1891.85 station at Bagdad ') in the manner proposed, as such employment would be in excess of the limits ' laid down by the Sublime Porte when giving permission for a gun-boat to station at Bagdad.' The Grand Vizier evidently referred to the authorisation for the retention of the &lt;£ Comet ' at Bagdad accorded in 1875. It will be remembered that the Porte regarded the 'Comet' as being in excess of the number of vessels authorised by the firman of 1834, con firmed by the vizierial letter of 1861, but gave permission in March 1875 (see p. 41) for it to remain ' sur les rivieres de la Mesopotamie suivant I'entente precedemment etablie,' this understanding presumably being the arrangement made in 1869 (see pp. 85, 36), when the Porte consented ' au remplacement par un autre navire ou batiment de la marine lioyale, la 4 Comete , ' :&gt; se trouvant sur les rivieres de Mesopotamie.' After consulting the India Office, instructions were given to Sir W. White to inform the Grand Vizier that, 'in the opinion of Her Majesty's Government the terms of the firman of the 29th December, 1834, did not restrict the navigation of the two steamers mentioned therein to Bagdad and its immediate neighbourhood, but sanctioned their navigating the Euphrates,' and that it was not apparent, in any other respect, how the employment of the 44 Comet' in the manner pro posed could be regarded as constituting a depar ture from the provisions of the firman. Sir W. White did not report whether he made a communication to .the Grand Vizier in accordance with these instructions, and, as no further cor respondence passed on the subject, there is no information available to show whether the ' Comet' was sent from Bagdad to Bussorah and employed as suggested on the Shatt-el-Arab. Another question respecting the Comet' arose nearly three years later (1894), when the consul-general at Bagdad made an official journey in the steamer up the Tigris as far as Samarra. The Porte protested against this proceeding, and the Turkish Ambassador stated that— , ' Le Gouvernement Imperial cousidere que ce voyage, effectue sans autorisation prealable, dans les eaux int^rieures de TEmpire a bord d'un batiment de guerre * Permission for the provisional retention of the Cornet' on the Tigris until the completion of the line of telegraphs between Bagdad and Fao was given in 1864 (see page 29). [163—1] Z86 constitue une serieuse irregularity le Gouvernemeut Imperial n'ay ant V ermiB la P r ^ sence d ' un 8tatlonuaire devant le consulat general d'Angleterre a Bagdad que par deference pour le dfair du Gouvernement anglais. Rustem Pasha urged that formal instructions should be sent to the consul-general— ' lui prescrivant de ne plus effectuer de pareils voyages, car il serait tr^s difficile au Gouvernement Imperial, quel que soit son desir d'etre agreable au consul general, de les autoriser de nouveau,' Rustem Pasha's attention was drawn to the To Rustem Pasha, note addressed to Musurus Pasha on the 11th ,Jun( 1 ' 18 *' July, 1885 (see pp. 75, 76), in which the hope was expressed ' that no opposition would be made to the ' stationnaire ' at Bagdad ascending the river for the purpose of conveying Her Majesty's consul-general to parts of his consular district v provided due notice were previously given to the local authorities,' and it was pointed out that on the present occasion such notice was duly given. To this note Rustem Pasha replied that, if the Rustem Paaha, ' Comet ' were authorised freely to navigate the October 1894 ' Tigris, the same privilege would be claimed on behalf of the vessels of their respective countries by other foreign consuls at Bagdad, and he requested the issue of instructions to Her Majesty's consul-general to abstain in future from making voyages up the Tigris above Bagdad. The India Office were informed privately that Sir P. Sanderson ustem iashas communication must be regarded t0 Sir as showing that permission would not in future be given for the consul-general at Bagdad to use the Comet for ascending the river above that town, but it was not considered necessary to do more than remind the consul-general of the instructions on the subject given in 1875. ere it may be observed that this practical recognition of the Turkish view that the ' Comet' ! ? as a stationnaire, and was not at liberty mi rMrrr,:' h '» cUm »•&lt;'■ « «.de, II,, aj„ 'r is,,'''!'','?

Such admission seems to exclude the application of the firman (which sanctioned the employment of two steamers on the Euphrates) to the case of the u Comet. But, on the other hand, it must be borne in mind that the original ' Comet' replaced the &lt;c Nitocris ' in 1852, and that the latter vessel was on the Euphrates in 1841 (when a firman was issued confirmatory of the firman of 1834), and remained at the disposal of the Political Resident at Bagdad after the idea of the Euphrates route to India was abandoned in 1843, and the three other vessels then in Mesopotamian waters were recalled to India. Moreover, it will be recollected that Mr. Stuart in his memorandum addressed to the Porte in 1865 (see p. 32) referred to the ' Comet' and ' Satellite '' as being em ployed on those rivers by virtue of the firman of 1834. Correspondence passed in 1894 relative to import duty charged at Bussorah on the ' Mala- mir,' and contained references to the navio-ation of the Shatt-el-Arab as far as Kurna which it is desirable to record in this memorandum. The ' Malamir ' was a steamer sent out in parts to Bussorah, put together there, and subsequently employed on the Karun and Shatt-el-Arab between Ahwaz and Bussorah. An import duty of 8 per cent, was paid on the parts of the vessel at Bussorah, and the company claimed a refund of 7 per cent, when the ' Malamir ' was recon structed and sent to the Karun. The Ottoman Government refused repayment on the ground that the Shatt-el-Arab between Bussorah and Mohammerah was Turkish water, but the com pany pointed out that this contention was not valid since vessels of all nations were allowed to ply between the sea and Bussorah without pay ment of any duty whatever. On the occasion of the ' Philomel' incident in 1874 the consul- general at Bagdad stated (see p. 42) that the Shatt-el-Arab had always been regarded as a free river, and that it was the custom for sea-going craft- Pt ti n .

In response to this instruction, the consul reported as follows : — ' The river between Bussorah and Kurna is as regards the levy of customs duty considered a free river, the Turkish authorities now prohibiting ocean steamers from going higher up the river than Bussorah, though until some few years ago it was customary for ocean steamers to load and unload at Maghil when more convenient.' This answer was considered to be incorrect by Enclosure in the consul-general at Bagdad, who made the No. following remarks on the question :— Commercial, June 20, 1894, 'From a little above Moharamerah (40 miles below Bussorah) the banks of the Shatt-el-Anib are on both sides Turkish territory, as they are np to and beyond the junction of the Euphrates and Tigris at Kurna (40 miles above Bussorah). Ships of ail nations are allowed freely (except when stopped at some point between Mohammerah and Bussorah to undergo quar antine) to come up to Bussorah, and, without payment of any port dues whatever (except, as I understand from a recent reference, in case of Turkish armed vessels), anchor, discharge and take in cargoes at the most convenient unoccupied anchorage available near the present custom-house. Some years back the custom-house was in Bussorah town, aud vessels need conveniently to proceed some 4 miles higher up the river than they do now, viz.: to Maghil, the property (as it still is of Messrs.

After repeated representations to the Porte, tlie Council of Ottoman Customs Administration agreed to regard the pieces used in the construc tion of the ' Malamir ' as goods in transit, and levied transit duty of 1 per cent, only, refunding the other 7 per cent, to the company. A similar course was taken in regard to coal imported via Bussorah for the use of the company's steamers on the Karun. Two other questions of concern to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company which arose in 1893-4 should obtain brief mention. The one related to the permission alleged to have been given in the case of the Oman Otto man steamers for the conveyance direct to Bagdad of cargo addressed to Bussorah, without customs clearance at the latter port. The company wished to obtain the same privilege, but it was doubtful from the enquiries made whether they really were debarred from carrying cargo in the same way as the Turkish company, and the matter was allowed to drop. The other question related to the disorganisation and want of accommodation at the Bagdad custom-house. In respect of this disorganised state of affairs the company put forward a statement of claim against the Porte for out-of-pocket expenses, but the Ambassador at Constantinople did not consider that such a claim could be substantiated, and no action was taken with regard to it. Subsidies had been received by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company from the Indian Government between 1860 and 1873 for a fortnightly mail service to* Bagdad at the rate of 4J300/. a year, between 1876 and 1880 for a service of three voyages a month at the rate of 3,600/. a year, between 1880 and 1884 for a weekly service at the same rate, and between 1884 and 1894 at the rate of 36,000 rupees a year. The question of renewal of the contract at a reduced subsidy came up for consideration in 1894. The company stated that, if permission could be obtained for the regular employment of their third steamer, which they had to main tain in readiness at Bussorah in case of accident to either of their other steamers, or if the prohibition against the towing of barges were relaxed, the contract could be accepted on the reduced terms, otherwise they feared that the reduction might restrict the operations or [163—1] 2 Aendanger the existence of the company. r lhe Ambassador at Constantinople and the consul- general at Bagdad were ol'^ opinion that, on political grounds, the contract should be renewed, and Sir P. Currie was asked if it would be possible to obtain from the Porte either of the concessions desired by the company. He pointed out that the pro-memorid annexed to article 1G of the proposed commercial treaty would give the company the right to tow barges, but it had not been approved up to that time by the Ottoman Council of Ministers, and he stated that any application to the Porte for permission to use a third sfeamer would be fruitless. The substance of this despatch was communicated to the company, and they were at the same time informed that the postmaster-general had been consulted as to the possibility of granting a subsidy from Imperial funds towards the mainten ance of the mail service, but he did not consider that there was justification for such payment. The contract was finally renewed by the Indian Government, a subsidy of 21,000 rupees a year being paid for a weekly service. The question of a further renewal came up for consideration, as will be seen later (see p. 102), in 1904. In consequence of the exceptionally low state of the Tigris in 1895, the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's steamers were unable to carry full cargo when going up and down the river on the mail service, and as a result there was au accumulation of goods at Bussorah. The company desired that the Porte should be asked to authorise the temporary use of barges, and pointed out that similar permission had been given in 1879, 1880, and 1881, during the famine at Bagdad, and in 1893, when quaran tine had been imposed as a precaution against the spread of cholera. Representations were accordingly made to the Porte, and permission was obtained for the company to employ barges temporarily. Early in the following year The company stated that they had been required bv the local Turkish authorities to cease towin- barges, and, in view of alleged attempts by oreigLers to obtain permission for running on Tigris, they suggested that the te should be requested to give them permanent authority to tow barges, and, further, tha steps should be taken to secure the removal oi the restrictions imposed on them in the event Sir P.

Currie, on the river. So far as could be ascertained from March 18 1896. en( l uir i es mad e at Constantinople there was no foundation for this report, at all events as regards the supposed action of the Messageries Maritimes, and the Ottoman Minister of Marine stated that he would strongly oppose any demand by a foreign company to obtain a concession for the navigation of the TigrLs. With respect to the towing of barges by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany, Sir P. Carrie considered it to be inadvisable to make an application for the permanent re cognition of the right claimed by the company, as such claim bad not been admitted by the Porte and had never been satisfactorily established; but he saw no objection to repeating the demand for temporary permission in the following year during the low-water season. Six months later the company stated that the river was low and that cargo was accumulating at Bussorah; application was thereupon made to the Porte for the renewal of temporary per mission to tow barges, but the Sultan could not be induced to issue an irade in favour of the company, and Sir P. Currie was informed by the Grand Vizier that objections had been raised by the Ottoman Minister of Marine to the grant of the desired permission. Accumulation of cargo became so great that the company were obliged to stop further shipments from Europe and India. Eepresentations respecting the hampered conditions of traffic on the Tigris were made by the London Chamber of Commerce, who sug gested that permission should be obtained for the company to employ a third steamer (placed temporarily, if so required, undei the Turkish flag) and to tow barges. They further suggested that, 'if the Porte objected to the extension of Sir P. Currie, No. 239, March 26 1896. Euphratos and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, September 15, 1896. Sir P.

These representations were referred to Constan- ^ ^ tinople, and Sir P. Currie addressed a note verbale £ ^ {30th January, 1897) to the Porte, submitting January 26, 1897, the suggestions respecting the employment of a third steamer and of barges. In the course of his note the following passage occurs, and seems to constitute an admission of the Turkish contention that the company were limited as regards the nunriber ot vessels em ployed by the firman of 1834 :— 'A third steamer which is in reserve cannot be utilised, as under the. terms of the Imperial firman only two English steamers are allowed to ply on the river'' Mr. Buchanan, special agent at Constantinople ^ 0 ' (ion ( ,laml)ep 1 0 of uommerce, of the London Chamber of Commerce, reported March 13,1897. that the Ottoman Minister of Marine could not be moved from his opposition to any extension of the company's privileges in regard to the navigation of the Tigris. Some months later the Porte replied to Sir Sir P. Currie, P. Currie's note to the effect that the commodore juiy^^lggy. at Bussorah had been directed to consider what measures might be necessary, in conformity with the requirements of commerce, for increasing the means of transport and for effecting the dispatch of merchandise on the Tigris with the greatest celerity. No reference, however, was made to the suggestions of the London Chamber of Commerce respecting the employ ment of the company's third steamer and barges. It was subsequently ascertained by the consul- Sir P. Currie, general at Bagdad that the local authorities had 665 ' not taken any action in the direction indicated 1897. by the Porte, and he mentioned that the com modore at Bussorah was personally interested in the Oman Ottoman Company, and was. a moving spirit in the opposition to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. After the temporary permission given to the Euphrates and iiiUphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com- Steam pany in 1895 to tow barges had lapsed, the Com^T company retained one of the barges at Bagdad, ^ 14 ' 1897 - and made use of it there as a stationary barge lor the discharge of cargo.

It will be remembered that in 1884-5 (see p. 74) the company asked for permission to station a barge at Bagdad for the same purpose, in view of insufficient wharf accommodation at the port, but that the Porte refused the request. ^ In the present instance the consul-general at Bagdad advised that the barge should be sent back to Bussorah, lest the Porte should refuse, on the ground of breach of privilege, any future application for renewal of the permission to tow barges; and tbe company were informed that Her Majesty's Government considered that the Porte were clearly within their rights in requiring the withdrawal of the barge. Erom the record of an interview on the subject between Vice-Admiral Emin Pasha, acting Yali of Bagdad, and the consul at Bus sorah, it appears that the company argued that the barge was only meant for unloading pur poses, and that, as they were allowed to have barges in Bussorah, they were equally entitled to have one at Bagdad. Emin Pasha main tained that this argument was based on insufficient knowledge of international laws governing the navigation of rivers. Bussorah, he said, was an open port, and the company therefore had a right to use barges there ; but Bagdad, on the other hand, was situated on the Tigris, which w r as closed to navigation except for Turkish steamers and for two of the company's steamers only, and the company had no right to keep a barge there. The consul admitted that Bagdad was not an open port, but pointed out that, as it was open by concession to the company's steamers, there could be no harm in allowing them the barge as a facility for unloading. Sir P. Currie addressed a note verhale to the Porte on the 5th August, 1897, consenting to the withdrawal of the company's barge from Bagdad on condition that permission should be given to the company to tow barges when the Tigris was low ; that instructions should be issued to expe dite the discharging and unloading of ships at Bagdad, in respect of which complaints of unfair treatment had been made by the company ; and that no hindrance or obstruction should be offered ' to the proper execution of the Imperial firman granted to Messrs. Lynch.' Pending the receipt of satisfactory assurances from the Porte, [163-1] ' 2 B j 5194 Sir P. Currie recommended that the company ^ should retain their barge at Bagdad. August 16, 1897. In the following month (September 1897) the company represented that the low-water season Navigation had commenced, and that the Tigris was expected 2^ to drop to a lower level than in previous years, 1897. and they urged that pressure should be brought to bear on the Porte to allow the towing of barsres. It seems that there had been a con- Sir P. Currie, . . . . .1 211, tinually increasing deterioration of the navigable March 29, 1897, . channel of the river owing to the amount of water carried off by the canals, which, originally constructed for irrigation purposes, had, from want of supervision and control, practically become rivers, seriously decreasing the volume of the parent stream. The matter had been Sir P. Currie, brought to the notice of the Porte by Sir P. Currie, who received assurances that works would be undertaken for the improvement of the river. When the company's letter of the 23rd September was communicated to him. Sir P. Currie caused verbal representations to be made Sir P. Currie, to the Turkish Foreign Minister with the view of October 8,1897 arriving at some arrangement respecting the improvement of the navigable channel of the Tigris, the towing of barges generally, and the maintenance of the barge at Bagdad. In support of these representations he addressed a 7iote Sir P Currie, l ' erb ' le t0 the Porte on the 7th October, 1897, but i^cemter 4 1397 only received in reply a vague assurance that measures would be taken to improve the course of navigation as soon as a decision had been arrived at by the Council of State. Further assurances respecting the improvement of the Sir P. Carrie, navigation of the Tigris were received earlv in 83 and 171 the following vear +1 'n i n* rt'bi uary 9 and o } \ oJo^ but the Porte refused March 21,1898 to give the company temporary permission to tow barges, and the Grand Vizier objected to submit the question again to the Sultan, as the latter had on two previous occasions declined to grant the necessary irade. 30 OOO^ntr 8 r ir ' d6 8ancti0nin 8 a grant of Sir P.

He stated that Mr. H. F. Lynch had suggested putting the barges in use notwithstanding Turkish opposi tion, and had enquired if, presuming this course were adopted, the consul-general at Bagdad could be instructed to prevent interference with them by the local authorities. Acting Oonsul- General Ramsay considered the plan likely to prove detrimental to British interests, and Mr. de Bunsen, who proposed to discountenance it, was instructed that it could not receive the support of Her Majesty's Government. In a note verbale from the Porte, replying to the representations mentioned in the preceding paragraph, further assurances were given that works would be undertaken, as soon as the state of the river permitted, for improving its course; but no more direct allusion was made to the application for permission to tow barges than the assertion, based on a report from the Governor-General of Bussorah, that there was no difficulty in the navigation of the river as the Tigris was then in flood. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company pointed out that the sum granted for improving the channel of the river was not only inadequate for its purpose but even insufficient to pay the engineers' salaries, and that no. steps had been taken to execute any of the necessary works. The Tigris was at a lower level, they said, than during the corresponding period of the previous year, and they feared they would be obliged again to suspend shipments unless allowed to use their barges. Further representations were accordingly made to the Porte, but the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs told the chief dragoman of the embassy that the Ottoman Council of State had decided against the company's application, and that it was useless to press the Sultan to reconsider his decision. From Tewfik Pasha's statement it appears that the Sultan was suspicious of British designs in the Persian Gulf, and his suspicions were increased by the presence in the Shatt-el- Arab of two British war-ships engaged in the suppression of piracy. Tewfik Pasha observed that he had received instructions to request the withdrawal of these ships. sx96 Information was received by the Embassy that, although an engineer had been sent to build canals and, dams at certain points on the Tigris, the work was of an inefficient and temporary character. Moreover, the engineer was attacked by local Arabs and his work destroyed. A memorandum was presented to the Porte by Sir N.^O 'Conor, the chief dragoman at Constantinople calling November 23, attention to this information, and pressing for 1898 - the grant of an adequate amount to ensure im provements being carried out in a permanent and satisfactory manner. The note also reiterated the request that the company should be permitted to use their barges pending completion of the work. When presenting the memorandum Mr. Block Sir N. 0'Conor, was informed by the Grand Vizier that the December, 21 Minister of Marine strongly opposed the com- 1898 - pany's application on the ground that the grant to them of further privileges would be detri mental to the Oman Ottoman Company. About the same time the advisability of applying direct to the vali for temporary permission to tow barges was discussed by the acting consul- general at Bagdad and the company's local agent, and both of them came to the conclusion that such application would do more harm than good, and might reopen the question of the stationary barge (see pp. 92,93) kept and used by the company as a depdtfor landing and receiving cargo at Bagdad. The company contended that Euphrates and the question of the stationary barge had nothing Steam to do with the claim to tow barges, and that the Company, barge would be withdrawn when promised altera- ^ mber 81 ' tions in the custom-house at Bagdad had been carried out. Owing in great part to the personal interven- Sir N. O'Conor, 01 , t!ie SultaQ . tlle repeated requests for T '. uoq permission to tow barges were ultimately acceded to by the Porte, and a vizierial order was issued to the Governors-General of Bussorah and Bagdad in June 1899 to permit barges to be towed by the company's steamers. Sir N. O'Conor refrained from raising the question whether the order was limited to the towing of two barges during low water, or was of more general application.

Thereupon the company suggested that, if permission was limited to the low season it should be recorded formally in writing as covering the period from the 1st July to the 31st January every year. Sir N. O'Conor explained that according to the spirit of his request the concession, although containing no special limitation, would only apply to the period of low water and to the prevention of accumula tion of cargo; and he advised that the company should not insist upon a definite period being fixed for the towing of barges. o o At the time when this permission to tow barges was given the Grand Yizier informed Sir N. O'Conor that an Imperial irade confirming it had been issued. It subsequently transpired that the irade was a verbal communication from the Sultan on the authority of which vizierial letters had been issued to the Valis of Bussorah and Bagdad. In August 1899 it was reported that the permission had been withdrawn at the instance of the Minister of the Ottoman Civil List, acting on the request of the Oman Company. This company, who had been taken over by the Civil List, alleged that they were being ruined by the facilities granted to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. Sir N. O'Conor reminded the Grand Vizier that the permission was indefinite as to duration, and the only limitation he could accept was restriction of towing of barges to the period between the 1st July and the 31st January. A compromise limiting the privilege to three years was proposed by Tewfik Pasha, but after reference home for instructions and for the opinion of the company, Sir N. O'Conor declined to accept it, whereupon the Sultan issued an irade authorising the towing of barges until the then existing accumulation of cargo had been worked olf, but no longer. Sir N. O'Conor refused to accept the issue of this irade as a solution of the question ; but, learning from the consul at Bussorah that the vali of the province had received instructions in conformity with it, he considered it advisable not to pursue the matter further. Tewfik Pasha pointed out, in a note (17th October, 1899) announcing the issue of the irade, that permission to tow barges was granted pro visionally as a favour, and must not be understood [163—1] 2 C ■ 5Z98 to constitute a right for the future. Sir N. O 'Conor, in his reply (25th October, 1891)), (Appendix XXIX.) maintained that the privilege was granted in virtue of a promise made by the Sultan (June 1899), and observed that, on account of the binding nature of the engagement taken, 1 ' he must continue to regard it as in full force. He pointed out to the Eoreisrn Office, however, that Sir N T . O'Conor, r . . Nos. 518 and 585, as no irade had been issued in confirmation of November 7 and the vizierial orders of June 1899, the latter were |^ lnt,(r ^ held to be revocable ; but this theory he had disputed, and he believed that the company would be able to continue under the later arrangement to tow their barges unmolested. From admissions made by Lynch'-s agent it was evident, as stated by the consul at Bussorah, that the ' empresscment Sir N. O'Conor to about the barges was fictitious,' and that, whilst r)ec^a.her' d ^9^ D, there was more cargo than the company's 1899 - steamers could carry at low water, the vessels would often go up the river half empty if they had not accumulations to work off in the hi Mi season. After the issue of the Sultan's irade the company continued to tow barges until the question of their right to do so was challenged in 1902. In October 1901 the Euphrates and Tigris Euphrates and Steam Navigation Company complained that nothing had been done to improve the condition ^ om pany, of tlie Tigris, which continued to deteriorate year an^u^^ 1 ' hy year, and that, as a result of the state of the 1902 - river, their service had become disorganised and cargo had accumulated at Bussorah, notwith standing the use of barges. They asked that permission should be obtained for them to use their reserve steamer, the ' Blosse Lynch,' for a definite period of three months to work off the accumulation, and stated that to allay Turkish susceptibilities they would be willing to run the vessel under the Ottoman flag. Sir N. O'Conor S ir N. O'Conor wasot opinion, however, that the time was not No8 -^ and 433, opportune for approaching the Porte on the subject, particularly as the local authorities were hen active in attempts to curtail the privileges enjoyed by the company, and a report had tllTVl ^ TUrkiSh P re8S t0 effect that lurkish Minister of Marine recommended suspension of the company's service, in view ot losses sustamed by the Oman Company in conse • quence of competition with the British line WUh stated thaU S rePOrt ' , ' WtiVer ' the Grand Vizier lhat he Was not aware of any intention to99 To Sir N.

O'Conor had been instructed in con- nection with the commercial treaty negotiations, to press for the permanent removal of restrictions as to the size and number of British vessels allowed to navigate the Tigris above Bussorah, and, whilst of opinion that paragraph 3 of the final protocol (see p. 84), should not be amended, he suggested that, if he could see his way to claim an extension of existing privileges, His Majesty's Government might make such exten sion a condition precedent to the signature of the treaty. In a later despatch (see Appendix XXXI) he gave reasons why the Porte should not be approached in regard to the employment of the company's third steamer and to an enlargement ot the status quo. He feared that representations on the subject might cause the Porte to call in question the company's right to tow barges, and further that other nations, if atten tion were called to the matter by an increase in the number of steamers, might seek most- favoured-nation treatment in respect of the com pany's privileges. In a note verbale dated the 10th March, 1902, the Porte requested that the company should be directed to discontinue towing barges, on the ground that the privilege had only been granted for a single occasion, and that its continued use was prejudicial to the rival Turkish company. It will be remembered that the rights of the company to tow barges were asserted in the pro-memorid of 1890-9 J (see p. 82), which was amended and included in the final protocol (see p. 84) of the new draft commercial treaty. Sir ]N T . O'Conor observed, in regard to the Porte's demand, that until the final protocol was accepted and signed, it would not be possible to point to any document in which the privilege of towing barges had been recognised by the Turkish Government. Tewfik Pasha, Turkish Minister for Eoreign Affairs, subsequently explained to Sir N. O'Conor that the Russian Embassy had demanded for a Russian company the same rights and privileges as those granted to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. Tewfik Pasha had stated in reply to this demand that Messrs. Lynch's privileges were of ancient date, and sanctioned by special firman, and that the Ottoman Government possessed the right to100 reserve to themselves the inland navigation of their rivers, and could not assent to the droit de cabotage being considered as conferring this right upon foreign countries. In the course of remarks made to Sir N. 0'Conor, he drew a dis tinction between Messrs. Lynch's ancient rights of navigation, 'which rested upon the firman of 1834,' and the more modern practice (dating from 1879) of towing barges under special permission given by the Porte in exceptional periods of low water or scarcity. In regard to this distinction, it should be noted that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company stated in 1880 (see p. 49) that ' cargo boats (belonging to British subjects) had from time immemorial been employed in the navigation of the rivers (Tigris and Euphrates), both tracked by men, and on occasion towed by steam power.' Sir N. O'Conor feared that, if the Porte continued to be pressed by Russia, far from securing for the company the privilege of running a third steamer, he would have difficulty in maintaining for them the privilege granted by vizierial order in 1899 to tow barges. Acting upon the Ambassador's advice, the Euphrates and company withdrew their request to run a third Steam steamer, but pointed out that its employment Com^' might become later a matter of vital necessity to March 29 ' 1902, them, as the Oman Company were supple menting their fleet by the addition of two new steamers and four barges. As regards towing of barges, the company contended that the Porte could not fairly with- draw from them that privilege, for nothing had been done to remove the causes which tended more and more to diminish the volume of river water and to render the Tigris unnavigable, thus making the use of barges a matter of yearly X?;. t r r p KO ' COn0r did n0t ^ in Sir N. O'Conor, writing to the Fortes note verbal of the 10th Na 163 .

Tigris by Russian steamers connected with a subsidised line running to the Persian Gulf, and were desirous of obtaining privileges similar to those enjoyed by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. When reporting this information to the Foreign Office, Sir N. O'Conor stated that he could discover nothing in the ' original firman '* giving the British Govern ment exclusive right of navigation, and observed that it was probable a similar demand to the Russian would be made by the German Govern ment in connection with the construction of the Bagdad Railway. In reply to this .despatch, Sir N\ O'Conor was told that His Majesty's Government were not entitled to claim a monopoly of the navigation of the Tigris for the British company. It was contended, how ever, by the company that the rights enjoyed by them on the Tigris had been ' in the nature of exclusive rights so far as nations foreign to Turkey were concerned,' as for forty years their steamers had navigated the river, and the British flag had been the only foreign flag in those waters. They considered that it would be unjust, after having created the trade and called into being the flourishing towns on the banks of the Tigris, if, on the acjmission of another foieign flag to the river, they were restricted to the use of two steamers and barges ; and they held, in such an event, that His Majesty's Government would be justified in demanding that the river should be thrown open as far as it was navigable to the steamers of all nations. Sir N. O Conor was subsequently instructed that the grant of a concession to a single foreign company to navigate an inland river can hardly be held to justify a claim by other nations to similar con cessions on the ground of being entitled to the treatment of the most favoured nation, as the concession was one of favour and convenience, limited to the actual requirements of the case, and not a matter of right.' He was further instructed that the admission of the steamers of another foreign country to the Tigris would afford ground for a contention that the naviga tion of the river must be thrown open without restriction to the vessels of all nations enjoying most-favoured-nation treatment. Sir N. O'Conor did not report what action, if any, was taken by * Presumably he meant the firman of 1834. [163—1] 2 D102 him upon receipt of these instructions, but nearly two years later he again referred in his despatch No. 239 of the 5th April, 1904 (see below), to Eussian action in regard to the navigation of the Tigris. Writing in August 1903, Sir N. O'Conor Sir N. 0 Conor, , . .i -i No. 440, submitted some observations on the proposed August 4,1903. establishment of transit warehouses at Bussorah, and the competition of the Oman Ottoman Steam-ship Company, which had for some time been in the hands of the Ottoman Civil List n (Seniye Department), with the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. These two matters were regarded as a serious attempt to run the vessels of the English company oft* the river, but Sir N. O'Conor did not believe the attempt so serious • as it was represented to be, and saw no reason to alter the opinion expressed in 1902 (p. 99) as to the inadvisability of asking the Porte to allow the company to run a third steamer on the Tigris. Early in 1904 Sir N. O'Conor reported that Sir N. O'Conor, the new Oman (Seniye) steamers were about to ^bmary 22,1904. be placed on tbe Tigris, and remarked that the competition was likely to benefit British trade, which had suffered from what were practically monopolist rates and from delays caused by accumulation of cargo. Earlj in the same year (1904) the question of Indi* Office, S renewing the Euphrates and Tigris Steam 11810112 ' 190 ^ Na\igation Company's mail contract came up for consideration, and the India Office proposed to insert a provision to secure greater regularity of service. In connection with this provision the question of the employment of a third steamer was raised, but Sir N. O'Conor still maintained Sir N. O'Conor, that it was useless to ask the Porte for permission. , He remarked that the company's privileges were ' envied by more than one foreign Power and grudged by the Porte, and mentioned that on the one hand the Russians were seeking to obtain similar privileges, and on the other tbe , m pany were improving their service bv placing new steamers on the Tigris. was Kid in f 6 year (1904) ' Wllenthe 'Comet' Foreign Office as laid up for repinrs, the Euphrates and Tigris f nute ' Steam Navigation Company proposed to lend ^ 18 ' 19M their reserve steamer to the consul-general at whiist ^ - evading the Sultan's prohiSon oT'a S103 Euphrates and Tigias Steam Navigation Company, February 23,1905.

When the question of an increase in the Turkish Customs was under consideration in 1905, the company urged that advantage should be taken of the negotiations, initiated by the Porte, to press for permission to use their third steamer; but Sir N. O'Conor was of opinion that the matter should be excluded from the scope of those negotiations. Further, he thought that the Porte might seek to withdraw the company's privileges of navigation on the Tigris if asked, at that moment, to allow another steamer to be employed on the river. The company, however, were feeling the competitioo with the new steamers of the Oman Administration^ and pressed upon the Foreign Office their claim to use a third steamer. Their case was submitted in a memorandum in May, 1905. In this memorandum articles 1, 23, and 27 of the Capitulations of 1809, and article 1 of the Treaty of Balta Liman, 1838, were quoted in confirma tion of ancient British right of navigation on the Euphrates and Tigris; the request which led to the issue of the firman of 1834 did not, it was stated, invalidate British rights of navigation enjoyed up to that time on the rivers; and reference was made to the vizierial letter of 1861, followed by the assertion that the British Govern ment had never admitted limitation of the company's right to the use of two steamers ; and finally it was claimed in the memorandum that, as the number of Turkish steamers had been increased, the company should be permitted, on the ground of equity and of their general rights ol navigation, to use another steamer. Sir N. O'Conor furnished categorical replies to the contentions put forward. He maintained that the general question of the right of British vessels to navigate the Euphrates and Tigris had never been raised, and to invoke the Capitulations of 1809 and the Treaty of Balta Liman in support of such right would not be to the advantage of the company, as the shipping of other Powers w T ould, under most -favoured-nation treatment, equally benefit by anything obtained for British shipping. He pointed out that the vizierial letter of 1861 clearly stated that, under the firmans of * The Administration then had on the river sk steamers— two of large size and four new steel barges.r» f Hf 1834 and 1841, authorisation had been given for. the permanent station of two steamers on the rivers, 'providing it were proved and cstahlislied that the advantages resulting would be mutual, and that no inconvenience would ensue there from ; ' and to say that the British Government had never admitted limitation of the company s rights to the use of two steamers was, he remarked, scarcely correct. As no monopoly of transport had been granted to the company, and as the Turkish Government possessed the undoubted right to place as many steamers and barges on the Tigris as they chose, Sir N. O'Conor did not see any ground upon which he could usefully put forward the company's demand for a third steamer. Arguments in reply to the above-quoted despatch were advanced by the company, who contended that the status quo on the Tigris had been entirely upset by the transfer of the Oman (Hamidieh or Seniy6) steamers to the Civil List, and by the increase in their number. These argu ments were communicated to Sir N. O'Conor by SirT. Sanderson, then Permanent Under-Secretary of State, who wrote, Our weak spot is that for many years we preferred not to claim privileges for the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company under the agreement of 1846, which would have exposed us to rival claims by foreigners under most-favoured-nation clauses, and that our representations have been based on the special permission given by the vizierial letter of 1861 to run two steamers on the rivers You will see that Lord Granville specially re- served (during the negotiations of 1883-4) the right of insisting upon our claims under the Agreement of 1846, and I should almost think that the weapon was good enough to brandish in the face of the Porte in case of Eeed. An extract from Sir N. O'Conor's reply is given as Appendix XXXII. He did not consider it possible to obtain the third steamer for the company ' on the grounds of either tlie firman of 1831, the vizierial letters of 1B41, 1846, 1861, the letter from the Porte of 1875, or the Gran- ville-Musurus negotiations of 1883-4;' and he was opposed to making a bargain with the Porte as suggested by Sir T. Sanderson, to allow the stipulation attached to article 16 of the draft commemal treaty (see pp. 82, 84) to come at once into operation. Mr. H. F. B.

Complaints in respect of unfair competition by the Hamidieh (Seniye) Administration and of differential treatment by the Turkish autho rities were made by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, but, on investiga tion by the consul at Bussorah, were not found to be well founded. Consul Crow considered that the reorganisation of the Turkish company, and the competition thereby created, had so far proved beneficial to the interests of British trade generally. Evidently, however, it was desired to extrude the English company from the Tigris trade, for in September 1906, a telegram was sent from the Minister of the Civil List to the new commandant at Bussorah, urging the latter to place the Hamidieh Steam-boat Administration on a better footing than that of Lynch's Company, and in any case to take such steps as would enable merchants and others to do without that com pany. Earlier in the same year (1906) the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company renewed their request for permission to use a third steamer. Sir E. Grey referred the matter to Sir N. O'Conor, but at the same time informed Mr. H, E. B. Lynch that ' the privileges of the company, both as regards the nature and perma nency of the rights granted to them .... do not, from a strictly le.£jal point of view, rest on sufficiently secure foundations to ensure their being defended with success if seriously called in question or submitted to arbitration. 5 ' Subse quently the company again urged their request, in view of the great accumulation of cargo at Bussorah, and Sir N. O'Conor addressed a note verbale to the Porte on the 12th January, 1907, asking that the company should be permitted to use their reserve steamer for the purpose of re lieving the congestion of traffic. It is to be observed that Sir N. O'Conor, in the course of this note, stated that the company were running by two steamers with barges on [163—1] the Tigris 2 E106 ' virtue of an Imperial firman granted in 183o (183^) and the various vizierial letters subse quently issued to them on various occasions by the Sublime Porte.' Sir N. O'Conor succeeded in negotiating an arrangement whereby the company was allowed to run a third steamer on the Tigris until the Hamidieh (Seniye) Administration of the Civil List had twelve cargo steamers in addition to those already plying between Bussorah and Bagdad. It was stipulated that this steamer should fly the Ottoman flag during the course of its voyages, the Grand Vizier regarding such stipulation as the only means of enabling him to ward off requests from other Powers to place vessels on the river. The arrangement was recorded in notes exchanged on the 21st February and the 4th March, 1907. The note signed by Tewflk Pasha was worded :— ' La Liste civile, qui a le monopole de la navigation but le ligre et I'Euphrate, donne a Messrs.

A further note was addressed to the Porte by Sir N.

O'Conor replied to this note on the 12th June by reminding Tewflk Pasha that, when the arrangement was made, the actual number of vessels plying on the Tigris was not mentioned ■ and he went on to say that the arrangement 'bad een accepted on the understanding that twelve more steamers should be placed on the river in addition to those actually running at the time, ie number of which had subsequently been found to be six.

O'Conor was informed by the Foreign Office that the concession for the em ployment of the third steamer shonld be regarded as similar to that in virtue of which the other steamers of the company had been allowed to tow barges. He pointed out, however, that no mention of barges had been made in the nego tiations subsequent to his note verbale of the 12th January, 1907, and proposed not to reply to the Porte's complaint, in the hope that the objection would not be pressed. No further action was taken in the matter. Attempts had been made by Sir G. Mackenzie (British India Steam Navigation Company) in 1901-5 to obtain command of the Oman ( Ha- midieh) steamers. In October 1905 he furnished the Foreign Office with a copy of a draft agree ment to ' lease, work, and manage the flotilla of river steamers and barges on the Euphrates and Tigris Eivers belonging to the Civil List.' Under article 2 of this agreement a monopoly of navigation was contemplated, exception being made in favour of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company; but it was pointed out in a memorandum furnished by the embassy at Constantinople that article 9 of the Bagdad Railway Convention tended to stultify such monopoly. Sir G. Mackenzie's negotiations ultimately proved unsuccessful. Nearly eighteen months later (March 19'&gt;7) it was reported from Constantinople that the Anatolian Railway Company were in negotia tion with the Turkish Civil List with a view to obtaining the latter's monopoly of navigation of the Tigris in return for a loan. Sir G. Mackenzie was then still engaged in trying to get control of the Hamidieh steamers. It was proposed that he should continue his efforts in combination with Mr. Lynch and Mr. D'Arcy, but as Mr. Lynch desired to bring about co-operation between the British and Turkish steamer services the proposal was not found to be practicable. In September 1908 Sir G. Mackenzie reported that the administration of the Hamidieh com pany was in a state of chaos, and he offered, through his agents at Constantinople, to purchase their steamers or to undertake the management of the river service, on the understanding that the vessels should fly the Ottoman flag. In the course of subsequent negotiationsiff M » ' : : (1908-9) he proposed the formation of a 1 urldsh company, with British capital and under British .gement, to take over the navigation conces- .. These negotiations were mana sion and river service, broken off in June 1909. Whilst in progress they were favourably regarded by the Foreign Office; and it may be mentioned that the Sub- Committee of the Committee of Imperial 'Defence, in their report of the 26th January, 1909, relative to the Persian Gulf and Bagdad Railway, recom mended, with reference to the development of the navigation of the Tigris and improvement of the waterway, that no favourable opportunity should be neglected to extend the British conces sion or to assist a British firm—preferably the British India Steam Navigation Company—to acquire the Hamidieh steamers. Sir G. Lowther reported in October 190S that the Turkish Minister for Public Works was in favour of a scheme under which the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company would abandon their existing rights of navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates, and combine with* the Hamidieh Steam-ship Company in the formation of an Ottoman company to be granted a conces sion for a monopoly of the navigation of those rivers. Negotiations were conducted on these lines, and a draft convention was drawn up in 1909 for the fusion of the rights and interests of the two companies. By the terms of this conven tion it was agreed that the two companies should form a single navigation company, registered in Turkey under the name of ' Societe anonytne otto mane de Navigation sur le Tigre, I'Euphratc et le Cbatt-el-Arab,' and subject to Ottoman law, with exclusive rights of navigation between Bussorah and Mosul, on the Tigris, and between Bussorah and Meskene (Belis), on the Euphrates. It was stipulated, inter alia, that the administra tion of the combination should be in tbe hands of a British president (having a casting vote), supported by a board of four British and four -Turkish directors; and that the new arrange ment should be in force for a term of seventy- ve years, power being retained by the Turkish Government to throw open the Mesopotamian nvers to steam navigation after thirty-seven and a-ialf years, conditionally on indemnification the company for loss of exclusive rights, and unconditionally after fifty-fi ye and a . half years rom the date of signature of the convention!

The Ottoman Government were to receive 101,000/., in fully paid-up shares, for the steamers, plant, goodwill, &amp;c., of the Hamidieh company, and the other moiety was to go to the shareholders of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany, who were to provide the working capital. Article 1 of the draft convention provided that les droits de I'exploitation de bateaux a vapeur dans le perimetre de la concession, conferes a Mr. Lynch par les firmans en date du 1831- et 1841 et autres lettres grand-vizierielles, sont confies, cedes et transferes a la Societe anonyme ottomane' (the proposed new company). The Turkish Government insisted upon the insertion jot an additional article (article 29), in virtue of which, a§ soon as the firman confirming the convention should be promulgated and the official transfer to the new company completed, the privileges formerly enjoyed by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company would be completely annulled. This article stipulated that a declaration of annulment should be made by Mr. Lynch and confirmed by the English authorities. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company did not object to the inclusion of the article in the convention provided that, in the event of the concession to be given to the new company being at any time withdrawn, they should not be precluded from recovering their existing rights ; but the Porte refused to modify the annulment clause. Counsel's opinion was taken on the point whether, in the event of the withdrawal of the proposed concession, the company could demand a revival of the status quo ante and restoration of the position and rights then being enjoyed. Mr. W. E. Hamilton, K.C., who was consulted, considered that, in the contingency contemplated, they would be entitled to claim a restitutio in integrum or equivalent compensation. The com pany thereupon asked for an assurance that, should occasion arise, His Majesty's Government would adopt and support the view expressed by Mr. Hamilton. It was considered desirable to refer the matter to the Law Officers, who advised that, if asked to assent to the annulment article, [163—11 2 F110 His Majesty's Government should state that they did so on condition that the company's rights and privileges would be restored in the event of the concession being withdrawn before the prescribed time. Sassoon Effendi, Jewish deputy for Bagdad, ^ ^ rlin g. was reported to have organised the campaign November 30, then being carried on in the Turkish press against the fusion arrangement, and it was also stated that German influences were at work in opposition to ihe agreement. Debates on the subject of the concession to the proposed company took place in the Turkish Parliament Mr - Marling, on the 11th and 13th December, 1909, and a No«.^36l^nd 363, motion was carried condemnins: the Government D r cem i^ r ri 1 . 1 ,^ d . 0 13, 1909 [4ol04 for desiring to grant a concession creating a and 45336, File monopoly and laying a charge on the Treasury; 322 09 ^ but subsequently a vote of confidence in the Government was carried, the effect of which was to authorise them, pending the passage of a Concessions Bill then before the Senate, to conclude the amalgamation of the two companies provided it involved no charge upon the Treasury. This stipulation was made because one of the articles of the fusion convention laid down that compensation should be paid to the new company by the Ottoman Government in the event of navigation being impeded or rendered impossible by irrigation works, then being projected and carried out by Sir W. Willcocks. As a result of the vote referred to above, the Mr. Marling, Ottoman Government were placed in an awkward No - 975 - dilemma; on the one hand they had given His Majesty's Government repeated assurances that Mle S22 / m 'i- they would effect the fusion, an essential part of which was the grant of adequate compensation if the navigability of the rivers were interfered with by the projected irrigation works; and, on the other, they could not conclude the conven- tion containing this essential point without submitting it to Parliament, which was not hkely to pass it. if it i nc i uded compensation. ith regard to the possibility of the irrigation worfa affecting navigation, it should be mentioned verbally info 1 ^ LOndon Was To Sir G.

Majesty's Government would give the company full support in maintaining all their rights, and even in exacting compensation, if in future years the rivers should run dry owing to the irrigation works undertaken by the Turkish Government. Pending the passage of the Concessions Bill defining the powers of the executive, the Porte refused to proceed further with the convention. The Bill was finally approved and became law towards the end of June 1910. It prohibited the executive from granting, without reference to Parliament, concessions imposing financial obligations on the State. Meanwhile, consider able opposition to the fusion scheme bad been manifested locally, and there w r as a strong feeling against it in the Turkish Chamber on account of its monopolistic character and its provision for compensation in the event of the rivers becoming unnavigable. After the concessions law was passed, Messrs. Lynch's agent (Mr. Whittall) was informed by the Minister for Public Works that the Porte declined to proceed further with the fusion negotiations. He was also told that in future the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates would be thrown open to Ottoman subjects only, and that no indemnity whatever would be paid to anyone in the event of navigation being stopped by irrigation works, as the T urkish Government reserved absolute freedom of action in regard to the disposal of the river waters. Subsequently, Mr. Whittall was given to understand that the Porte w^ould not object to the fusion, but the new company could not be granted a monopoly and would only receive simple permits of navigation similar to those issued to Turkish subjects. These conditions were not considered acceptable by the Kuphiates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, who in the circumstances preferred to remain under the protection of the British flag. At the time of the final breakdown of the fusion negotiations, navigation permits were being issued to Ottoman subjects by the ^ali of Bagdad. Objection to the Vali's action was taken by Sir G. Lowther on the ground of the injury to the Tigris and Euphrates Company's interests arising from the increase of competition. The Porte, however, maintained their right to grant such permits. Permission had been given in the summer of 1909 to Agha Mohammed112 Jaffer, a Turkish subject, to run two steamers with barges on the Euphrates, and the company Euphrates a^nd considered that this made it necessary lor them Navigation to assert their rights to navigate that river. 'Jo this end, they proposed to send a tug and barge [19979, File there to make a few trips with the view to the establishment, if practicable, of a regular service. They were prepared to run the tug either under the British or Ottoman flag, or to form a nominal Turkish Companv to run it.

Subsequently they stated that, in ad- Euphrates and ditiou to the native steamer service on the Euphrates, navigation permits had been granted Company, to natives for services above Bagdad, and between [37935,' File 1910 Bagdad and Bussorah. i«9/ioj.

He considered it futile for the 41320 ' company qua foreigners to apply to the Porte ' ' ' i ' for a permit to send a tug and barge up the Euphrates, or for a permit to form an Ottoman Company to ply on the rivers, but suggested that they might obtain permits ot navigation locally ' under cover of some Ottoman subject's name.'* When the company were informed of Sir G.

During the year 1910 some difficulty was made locally by the Yali of Bussorah when the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany proposed to run a new steamer, the ' Julnar,' in place of the ' Blosse Lynch,' which they intended to put in reserve; and again when the reserve steamer (' Blosse Lynch ') was sub stituted for the ' J ulnar,' the latter vessel having been laid up for repairs.* The vali's contention was, in effect, that the permission given to the company to run a third steamer caused them to forfeit the right of keeping one in reserve and of To Sir G.

The matter was referred to the Embassy at Constantinople, but the charge d'affaires thought it unlikely that the Porte would grant permission. In June of the following year (1911) the company applied through their agents at Bagdad and Constan tinople to be allowed to run an extra steamer under the Turkish flag and subject to the same conditions as those stipulated in the permits issued to Ottomans. The Turkish Minister of Public Works considered that compliance with this request w 'Ould be tantamount to permanent permission, and contrary to regulations he was about to issue reserving the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates for bond fide Ottoman com panies. Subsequently he authorised the Yali of Bagdad to allow the company to run the extra steamer for two months. The vali, however, did not act on this authority; but Sir G.

Before bringing to a conclusion the historical portion of this memorandum it is desirable to refer to certain incidents occurring in 1906 onwards, in connection with which mention was made of the ' Comet,' of the presence of British • gun-boats at Bussorah, and their proposed employment on the Tigris, and of the right of British Government steamers to navigate the Tigris and Euphrates. In the course of correspondence w^hich took [File 18791/06. j place in 1906, relative to attacks made by Arabs on the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's steamers, proposals were made that the ^Comet' should accompany the vessels; that British Indian troops should be put on board them, and that a British gun-boat should patrol the Tigris. It was considered advisable, however, t6 leave to the Turkish authorities the full responsibility of policing the river and protecting traffic. Two years later one e company s steamers was again attacked by Arabs, and the mail service and river traffic were temporar^y suspended. It was suggested To Euphrates and y the company that the ' Comet' should be S lgris Steam -nt to patrol the Tigris and protect their COnSidered that SUCh a P 0 lead to serious incidents.

Further Arab disturbances took place in 1909, and became so alarming that His Majesty's ship ' Sphinx' was sent to Bussorah for the pro tection of British lives and property. Steps were taken by the consul-general at Bagdad to prepare the ' Comet,' by means of iron plates, &amp;c. } for use, if necessary, in tbe disturbed area, and as an escort to the company's steamers. The necessity for the employment of the vessel in this way, however, did not arise. With reference to the dispatch of His Majesty's ship ' Sphinx ' to Bussorah, referred to in the preceding paragraph, it should be noted that His Majesty's ship ' Lapwing' was sent to that port in 1909 to protect British shipping engaged in the date trade from piratical attacks in the Shatt-el-Arab. In 1907 a report was furnished to the Embassy at Constantinople by the acting consul-general at Bagdad relative to the right of British Govern ment vessels to navigate the Tigris above Bagdad. This report referred to the incident in 1894 (see pp. 85, 86), when the then consul-general had proceeded to Samarra in the ' Comet.' An assur ance was given on that occasion that in future cases the consent of the Turkish authorities should first be obtained, but the Porte indicated that such permission would not be granted, as other Powers might claim a similar privilege. Consul-general Ramsay considered that there were good grounds for claiming for the ' Comet' the right of free movement on the rivers of Mesopotamia, and held that it was important to maintain such right As the expediency of raising the question officially was questionable. Sir N. O'Conor proposed to inform him that there was no objection to his taking advantage of any opportunity, suggested or favoured by events or special circumstances, to navigate the river in the 'Comet' above Bagdad. This pro posal was approved. Such an opportunity occurred in December 1908, when Consul- General Bamsay proceeded in the ' Comet' as far as Talibiya, six steaming hours above Bagdad. He was accompanied by Sir W. Willcocks and his engineers, engaged in irrigation works,* and * Sir W.

The plan was osten sibly put forward by Sir W. Willcocks, but the Grand Vizier stated that there might be objec tions to the use of the vessel, and recommended that some other steamer should be hired. The consul-general then proposed to accustom the authorities of the Bussorah vilayet at Kurna to the passage of the 'Comet' up the Euphrates on sporting expeditions, and his proposal was approved. Correspondence which passed in 1912, touch ing various questions connected with the navi gation of the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, has been summarised for convenience of reference in the chronological portion (Part IV) of this memorandum, but has not been dealt with here, and this portion (historical) concludes with the period ending 1911.

THE rights of British subjects in Turkey are, owing to the expiration of other treaties, mainly regulated by the Capitulations of September 1675, but no mention is made therein of any rights to navigate the internal waters of Turkey, and the only method of securing such privileges would appear to be by appealing to the most favoured-nation clause (article 18), which is as follows:— 1 hat all Capitulations, privileges, and articles, granted to the French, Venetian, and other Princes, who are in amity with the Sublime Porte, having been in like manner, through favour, granted to the English, by virtue of our special command, the same shall always be observed according to the form and tenour thereof, so that no one in future do presume to violate the same or act in contravention thereof.' The Capitulations or treaties which apply to internal navigation are those with the Netherlands of the 17th September, 1680; with Austria, signed at Passarovitz on the 27th July, 1718, the preamble and article 1; and the Sened, or ' Capitulations nouvelles ' of the 24th February, 1784, article 4, 6, and 7 ; the Eussian Convention of 1783 ; and the Belgian Treatv of 1838. The Dutch Capitulations of 1680, article 56, say, ' Les negociants et autres sujets neerlandais pourront transporter les marchandises qu'ils auront achetees; ils pourront les charrier par terre et par le Don a Azoff en Moscovie et en Hussie.' As the Don was at that time partly in Ottoman territory, rights of navigation on the Turkish portion of that river were thus granted to Dutch merchants. It may be said that the case of the Don is not comparable with that of the Tigris and Euphrates, because it was not at that time wholly within Turkish territory, but it should be noted that these rights were granted before the date of the Treaty of Vienna. The case is quoted to show that Turkish practice was not at that time opposed to the navigation of their rivers by foreigners. [163—4] B3 Testa's &lt;&lt; Collection of Turkish Treaties,' and are quoted and referred to by Young in his 'Corps de Droit ottoman.' In referring to these treaties, Mr. Young, in his ' Corps de Droit ottoman,' says : ' En pre sence d'un texte aussi clairement redige, la Sublime Porte a renonce a toute opposition active aux reclamations etrangdres.'' (Vol. iii, p. 65.) Sir G. Lowther, in his No. 228 of the 19th March, 1912, commenting on this statement, expressed an opinion that this did not refer to ' cabotage fluvial ' or ' petit cabotage,' but only to direct trading. State Papers, In the convention with Hussia, signed at Con- 767, and P 768.' stantinople on the 10th (24th) June, 1783, article 1 is as follows :— ' La Sublime Porte permet eutierement a tous leg sujets russes eD general de naviguer librement et de trafiquer dans tous ses l^tats tapt par terre que sur les mers et eaux, ainsi que sur le Danube, et partout ou la navigation et le commerce pourront convenir auxsujets russes.' Article 2 grants rights of entry to the subjects of the two contracting parties into ports, places, and towns with their vessels. Article 6 allows the subjects of the Sublime Porte 'venir par terre et par mer' in Hussia. It will be noticed that Russians were allowed to navigate ' les mers et eaux' and also the Danube, the lower part of which was at that time wholly within Turkish territory. ^ The question of the right of foreign nations to navigate the rivers of the Ottoman Empire under their own flags was raised in 1856 with regard to the Nile and the Mahmoudieh Canal. Her Majesty's agent and Consul-General in Egypt reported that certain exclusive rights of towing on the Nile and canals of Egypt had been granted to an Egyptian Towing Company for fifteen years. His despatch was submitted to the Board of Trade and to the Queen's Advocate, and he was informed on the 17th November, 1856 (No. 40), that ' as regards the British flag, this right ' [of navigation] 'can only be claimed under the Treaty with Turkey of the 16th August, 1838, on the ground that the Sultan has ' granted it to, or * suffered it to be enjoyed' by, the ships Hon. P. Bruce, No. 38, August 30, 1856.and subjects of some other foreign Power, and this appears not only not to have been done, but to have been studiously avoided by the Egyptian Government, and not to haVe been insisted on or exercised by Great Britain; Her Majesty's Government is, therefore, not at present in a position actually and immediately to claim this right.' [With regard to the British Treaty of 1838, it is necessary to remark that we cannot appeal to it, as it was expressly superseded by that ot 1861, nor can we appeal to this latter treaty, which is now also extinct; but we claim most -favoured- To Lord Dufferin, nation treatment under the above-quoted articlelS Commercial, of the Capitulations.] September 20, . j • i ^ 1888. The instructions then continued :— ' ' With respect to the treaties* relied upon, if the foreign Governments in question had intended to have secured for their ships, in addition to their right to enter the Nile from the sea and to leave it for the sea, the more special and peculiar right (in derogation of the ordinary law and usage of nations) to carry on the internal trade upon that river, as, for instance, that from Cairo to the first Cataract and back again, it would have been natural that this special and peculiar right should have been clearly and expressly mentioned in the treaties; more particularly as the Danube is specially mentioned in article 7 of the treaty between Turkey and Russia of 1783 ; in the absence of any such mention of it the Egyptian Government mav fairly argue expressio unius est exclutio alterius.' The despatch further stated that the right, if it ever had existed, had been in effect waived or abandoned at any rate, from 1841 till 1856—'by Great Britain, advisedly and with full knowledge of the subject: It was added that the right in question did 1 not result by neces sary implication from the treaties between Turkey and Austria and Russia.' It was further said that,' should the Government of Egypt grant that right to the subjects or ships of any nation generally and indis- cnmmately, or suffer them so to exercise it, it would then be for Her Majesty's Government to determine whether they would insist upou it in favour of British subjects.'' l It t\ould appear, however, that in 1841 the Austrian consul-general in Egypt had protested against the exclusion of Austrian vessels from the navigation of the Nile, and that this protest, vncli had been made in accordance with the treaty provisions, had been approved by the * /•«., the treaties of 1713, 1783, and 1784,5 Memorandum. September 23, 1856. Sir P. Currie, No. 98, Commercial, December 31, 1896. Internuncio at Constantinople. It would seem difficult to reconcile the views expressed in the instructions to Mr. Bruce with the clearly stated. 1 provisions of the Austrian Treaty of 1718 and the Sened of 1784, quoted above. The Bagdad Railway Convention of the 5th March, 1903, would not, I think, give us any claim to navigate the Mesopotamian rivers, any privileges of navigation given to the company by articles 9 and 23 being limited to the time during which the works are being carried on ; besides, it is a concession to what is, by article 2 of its statutes, an Ottoman company. I cannot find that the above-mentioned Austrian treaties have ever been referred to in the various memoranda and papers relating to the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates. The question of the right to navigate the rivers of Turkey was again raised in 1889 in the case of the ' Euxine.' This vessel was refused access to Bartin, a Turkish port on a river of the same name, which flows into the Black Sea. The refusal of the Turkish Government was based on the fact that Bartin was 4J miles from the sea, and on that account could not be con sidered to be a seaport. It was therefore contended that only Turkish ships could have access to it. In discussing this case a reference was made to the Eiver Boyana, the right to navigate which as far as the town of Oboti had been admitted in the case of Austrians under the provisions of the Treaty of Passarovitz and of the Sened of 1784, the Turkish Government at the same time reserving the 'cabotage fluvial' to Turkish subjects. In Sir P. Currie's despatch a memorandum, drawn up by Mr. C. N. Elliot, was forwarded, in which a part of article 1 of the Treaty of Passa rovitz and articles 1 and ( j of the Sened A \ere quoted ; but no reference was made to the words, ' dans tous les Etats de FEmpire ottoman,' at the end of article 1 of the treaty, or to what seems to me to be the far stronger article 4 of the Sened, which gives rights 44 de faire commerce dans tous les pays et toutes les provinces de I'Empire ottoman, soit par mer, soit par fleuves, d'aborder, dans leurs voyages par terre, par mer, ou par les fieuves, a tel endroit ou ils le cioiiont convenable,' &amp;c. As a result of this, in the note sent to the Porte, these passages were omitted, [163—41 0and, naturally, in the Turkish answer denying the existence of the rights of navigation claimed, reference to them was also omitted. The reply of the Porte asserted that the Treaty of Passarovitz and the Sened of 1781 yielded to Austrian subjects rights on the Danube alone, to the exclusion ot the coasting trade, which, it stated, was confined to Turkish subjects, and it contended that the treaties referred to granted access only to seaports. It Was also argued that this had been admitted by the British Government, in consequence of their application, in the case of the Tigris and Euphrates, for firmans to enable Messrs. Lynch and Co. to navigate those rivers. The force of these arguments was controverted To Sir P. Currie, in a note which Sir P. Currie was authorised to Commlrcial address to the Turkish Government. In this Ma y 6 ' 189 7. note our position was maintained, and it was contended that the Austrian treaties applied, Hot only to the Danube, but to the other rivers of Turkey, and the case of the Boyana was ' quoted in support of this view. The Turkish statements respecting the coasting trade were treated as irrelevant, as Her Majesty's Govern ment had put forward no claim to fluvial cabotage for British vessels ; thev had merelv asserted their right to proceed to river ports from the sea to the rivers. The note concluded by a notification that Her Majesty's Government held themselves at liberty to claim and enforce their right whenever they might think proper. This note was communicated to the Porte on the Sir G. Lowtber, 13th May, 1897, but no record exists in the N0, 228 ' twig.

We may therefore conclude that Great Britain can claim, under the various treaties above quoted, to be entitled to engage in the naviga tion of the internal waters of the Ottoman Empire geiierally—certainly for the direct trade, and I think also for the internal coasting trade,* though this is not so certain; and this, perhaps, may account for our applications for firmans, and for Lord Stratford's arrangement of 1846 being made without reference to the Austrian and other treaties.

PEOM a careful study of the papers referred to in the foregoing memoranda, the following conclusions have been arrived at:— 1. The right of carrying on trade and navigation on the Mesopotamian rivers has been secured by usage and consent. British merchants have carried on a trade under the British flag with Bussorah in British- built and owned vessels, and with. Bagdad in British-owned native-built boats, since the middle of the seventeenth century, with the consent of the Turkish authorities before the grant of any Imperial lirman, and they have had commercial establishments both at Bussorah and Bagdad for many years. They have also been in the habit of navigating the upper reaches of the rivers on native-built rafts, w r here boats were unavailable. 2. Rights of navigation have been granted to British Government vessels. British vessels have been attached to the Residency at Bagdad, then an establishment of the East India Company, since at least 1820. In 1834 the British Government obtained a firman from the Porte, w^hich w 7 as renewed in 18il, enabling them to station two vessels on the Euphrates. These vessels w r ere allowed to carry mails and to navigate and survey not only the Euphrates but the Tigris and the Shatt-el- Arab without protest; while in 1840, also without protest, the number of these vessels was increased to four until 1842, w r hen three of them were withdrawn for service in India. The remaining steamer continued to carry on its duties as before without any restrictions. It should be noted that these two firmans were liable to be cancelled. 3. General and unrestricted rights of navigation under the British flag granted to Jiritish merchant vessels in 1846. In 1812 and the following years disputes arose in regard to the duties levied on British [163—6] Bmerchant vessels and on British-owned native- built boats, which resulted in the arrangement of 1816. This arrangement was put into force by a vizierial letter, and was quite distinct from the lirmans of 18oi and 1S41, as it clearly refers to merchant vessels only; it refers also to the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, and contains no mention of the above-mentioned firmans. It is concerned with the navigation, unre stricted in any way, of the rivers, with the flag to be used, and with the payment of duties by British trading vessels, whether coming from the sea or engaged in the internal traffic. No mention is made of Government vessels, with which the firmans of 1834 and 1841 dealt exclusively, or of any distinction between steamers and sailing vessels. No provision is made in this letter for termi nating or amending its provisions. Doubts were raised, both at the Embassy at Constantinople and by the Turkish Government, as to the validity of this arrangement, but the documents recently found, and the fact that the Turkish Government confirmed it in the vizierial letter ot 1861, would seem to remove such doubts. In any case, the Turkish argument, that the arrangement of 1846 merely referred to duties, and did not grant any general rights of naviga tion, if it were true, would have little force, as the claim to levy duties clearly involves the admission of the legality of the navigation on which such duties are imposed. So fai the British position was a fairly clear and strong one, the British Government having secured rights on the Mesopotamian rivers both for Government vessels and for merchant vessels and boats. But after 1860 their position was weakened by the form adopted by the Turkish Government in drawing up the vizierial letter of 1861, granting rights to Messrs. Lynch and Co. to navigate the rivers. . 4. The establishment Tigris Steam Navigation Company uas secured in 1859-61. In 1S59, Sir H. Bulwer, His Majesty 's Ambas sador at Constantinople, was asked by Messrs.Lynch and Co. to support a scheme which they put forward for placing steamers on the Euphrates and Tigris for commercial purposes. Unfortunately the Ambassador was doubtful as to the efficacy of the arrangement of 1S46, and, on the suggestion of the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, applied for, and obtained, as recorded in the vizierial letter of 1861, permission to have the scheme in question carried out. This vizierial letter, though granted for the express purpose of enabling Messrs. Lynch and Co. to carry out their scheme, is couched in general terms, and does not mention the name of that firm. Jt combines very skilfully, from the Turkish point of view, the firmans of 1834 and 1811 with the arrangement of 1846, so that the privileges conferred by the firmans on two British Govern ment vessels stationed on the Euphrates are mixed up with the general and unrestricted rights of navigating the Tigris and Euphrates granted to British merchant vessels in 1846. 5. The Right to Navigate the Rivers of Turkey secured under various Treaties by the ' most-favoured-nation ' clause in the British Capitulations. We have not pressed our claims to navigate the Mesopotamian rivers on the ground of our treaty rights partly because we do not seem, until quite recently, to have recognised the strength of our position in this respect, and partly, no doubt ; because the success of a claim on this ground would have thrown open the navigation to all flags under the most-favoured-nation treatment clauses of the treaties between Turkey and other Powers. We, however, as well as Messrs. Lynch and Co., have suggested the opening of the navigation to all flags, but the suggestion has not been strongly supported, and the Turks have con sistently opposed it. Briefly stated, British rights are :— (a.) The right, subject to revocation, for British Government vessels to navigate the Euphrates, and the right of these vessels to navigate the Tigris and the Shatt-el-Arab by usage ; (fc.) By treaty, usage, early grants, and the arrangement of 1846, the right of British merchant■ ■ vessels to navigate the Mesopotamian rivers; and (c.) The right of ^fessrs. Lynch and Co. to can v on trade in their steamers on the Meso- * potamian rivers. A short summary of the negotiations subse quent to 1861 will show how, owing to various / causes, the British position has been Effected, and ' how the Turkish Government lias succeeded in gradually reducing the value • of the rights formerly enjoyed by Great Britain. It must be admitted that Turkey has been in a difficult position; she naturally was unwilling to allow foreigners srenerally to navigate the o o ^ o rivers of her dominions, and she has had to contend with the difficulties created bv her Capitulations and the concessions she has made to Great Britain. The confusion created by running the firmans of 1834 and 1841 and the agreement of 1846 together was soon taken advantage of by the Turkish Government, when in 1864 they objected to Messrs. Lynch and Co. putting a second steamer on the rivers, alleging that the ' Comet,' the Government vessel, carried out the permission given in the vizierial letter of 1861, which they contended only enabled Messrs. Lynch and Co. to employ two steamers, thus quite ignoring the arrangement of 1846, and confusing Government and merchant steamers together. In fact, the Turkish Govern ment has done its best by indirect methods and otherwise to get rid of the 1846 arrangement, and the British Government for a time prac tically acquiesced in this action, especially in the correspondence of 1864 and of 1873-74. Ihis acquiescence has been partly due to a fear that to carry out the arrangement in its entirety would enable other nations to claim the same privileges under the most-favoured-nation clauses in their treaties, though it should be noted that His Majesty's Government did in the correspondence on various occasions, and in statements made in Parliament, advocate throw mg open the navigation of the Mesopo tamian rivers to all fla^s. In carrying out Iter policy of ousting British vessels from the navigation of the Mesopotamian rs, lurkey on many occasions placed diffi- 168 111 10 wa y of su &lt;='i navigation. Sheraised questions as to the use and replacement of the ' Comet,' the use of a third steamer, of a steam launch and of barges by Messrs. Lynch, and Co., and the dimensions of the steamers, &amp;g., till in 1883 she prohibited Messrs. Lynch and Co. from navigating the Tigris at all. In that year the question was in consequence carefully examined, memoranda of great value were drawn up, especially that written by Mr. Plowden,* and the matter was submitted to the Law Officers, and a reply to the Turkish statement, drawn up by Sir Julian Pauncefote, was communicated to the Turkish Ambassador in London on the 6th June, 1884. (Appendix XXV.) This reply was approved by the Law Officers and contained a very clear statement of the British case. It was effective so far, as to induce the Turkish Government to allow Messrs. Lynch and Co. to resume their traffic on the Tigris ; but nothing further was done to secure privileges for British commerce generally. Both in this reply and in the statement made in Parliament on the 8th August, 1881, British general rights were reserved, though they were not pressed. The Turkish policy of attempting to restrict the privileges enjoyed by the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company was continued, and the limitation of the number of steamers em ployed to two was insisted on. This action was due, in part at any rate, to the unsuccessful attempts of other foreign nations, in 1882-4, and again in 1896 and 1902, to obtain permission to navigate the Mesopotamian rivers. An attempt was also made to dispute the freedom to naviga tion of the Shatt-el-Arab between Bussorah and Mohammerah, a part of the river which had up to that time been regarded as open to all- vessels. Various attempts were, however, made to improve the position of the Tigris and Euphrates Company, but they w r ere, if successful, generally only temporary, such as the use of barges to convey food in famine times or to clear off accu mulations of goods ; eventually, however, a some what grudging permission to tow barges was obtained (1899) and the use of a third steamer, flying the Ottoman flag, was allowed (1907;. * A more important memorandum by Mr. Plovvden was written in 1881. [163—6] C1(1 If r I The Turkish company which had for years been navigating the Mesopotamian rivers was taken over by the Turkish Civil List, and it was partly owincr to this that the Turkisli Government were O so anxious to limit the rights of the British company. When the nesrotiations for a commercial treatv ZD •/ between Great Britain and Turkey were under discussion (1891-1901), the British negotiators made many attempts to define and secure the British company's privileges and to retain the general rights of British shipping on the rivers. For this purpose a pro-memorid, attached to article 1(5 (afterwards IS) of the draft treaty, was drawn up and signed by both parties ad referendum, in which various concessions were made, but as the negotiations were not carried to a termination the conclusions arrived at were not bindin 0, on either party. Attempts were also made by the Turkish Government to prevent vessels of war from frequenting the Shatt-el-Arab between Bussorah and Kurna, and even to prevent them from ascending as far as Bussorah. His Majesty's Government gave way with regard to Kurna, but maintained the right of their vessels to l ^ o to Bussorah. Even the rights of the ' Comet,' the station- naire attached to the British Residency at Bagdad, were questioned. Attempts were made in 1905 and in the follow ing years by Sir G. Mackenzie, of the British India Steam Navigation Company, to get the control of tbe Turkish Hamidieh Company into t ieir hands, but this and an attempt to unite e Euphrates and Tigris Company with the urkish Company under the Ottoman fla' failed. / 0 It will be seen that the British Government had under tbe firmans of 1834 and 1841 the ngh to navigate the Euphrates; that a general right of navigation on all the rivers was for a few jears exercised by a flotilla of four British Government ships, which was reduced to one ship and that the rights of this ship were ( ven ually curtailed to such an extent that she was only allowed to navigate the Tigris and Shatt- el-Arab between Bagdad and tbe sea lettl ofisifi ir T . tbat Under the vizierial rights for r &gt;■ ,! tlSh Govern nient obtained g s ^ British merchant vessels to navigate10 ■ • ■ -- • — - —»••• • t; the Mesopotamian rivers, which were never really exercised, and which were practically abandoned, though reserved in theory. And that under the vizierial letter of 1861 special privileges were granted to the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company (Messrs. Lynch and Co.), and that these, with a few additions of a later date, are the only ones now surviving except those enioved hv the ' Comet.' R. W. BRA1ST. i 'J JPart IV. CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE. 1579.

The question of the Euphrates route to India was raised in this year. 1830 —About this date the Vali of Bagdad endeavoured to establish steam-vessels on the Tigris, but the intention was not carried out. On the 2nd October, 1831, the Pasha of Bagdad issued a booyooroldi adhering to the previous treaty, &amp;c., granting rights to British subjects and to the merchants and ships arriving from Hindustan. In 1832 the political agent went to reside permanently at Bagdad, the common duties at Bussorah being carried out by his assistant, and ascended the river in a British vessel, flying the British flag. 1834. —Parliament granted 20,000/. towards the cost of a trial of the Euphrates route An expedition was fitted out under the command of Captain (later Colonel) Chesney with this object, and two iron vessels, tlie ' Euphratesand ' Tigris,' were sent out in pieces, transported overland from the Mediterranean, and put together and launched on the Euphrates. The British Ambassador, in pressing the matter on the Turkish Government, pointed out the advantages that would accrue to commerce. On the 16th December, 183^, Lord Ponsonby announced thnt permission had been given by the Porte for two vessels to navigate the Euphrates in turn, with the qualification that it should only hold good whilst no inconvenience resulted to either party therefrom, and that, if such inconvenience should occur, the method of putting a stop to it should be arranged with His Majesty's Ambassador. The Porte was asked to grant permission for the expedition, and after some delay a firman was granted on the 29th December, 1834, and sent to Bagdad, allowing two steamers to navigate the Euphrates by turns to facilitate com- [163] Cmcrce, as loDg as it was convenient to Ixrth 1834 (con/.) parties and no inconvenience was caused. (Appendix III.) In consequence of this, the Pasha ot Jligdad 1835. issued a ' Booyooroldi' on the 11th February, Malet, precis, 1835, to the officials on both banks 'of the '* Euphrates from Oanah to Bussorah. ordering them to protect and assist the two vessels ' which are passing for the purposes ot trade by permission of the Sublime Porte.

In the same year Lieutenant Lynch brought the steam-ship 'Euphrates' down the Saklawiya Canal [joining the Tigris and Euphrates above Bagdad], and he succeeded in ascending the Tigris to a higher point than had ever yet been achieved. This was to Kut Abdulla, near Mosul, thereby proving that the river was navigable by steam- vessels up to that point.

The fact, however, remains that the vessels did arrive and did navigate the rivers. In the same year Colonel Taylor established, in connection with the steamer on the Euphrates (?

He also reported that the Tigris had been experimentally surveyed up to Mosul; and he described the ascent of the Euphrates to near Belis by three of the steamers, and a plan for combining the Tigris and Euphrates by horse from Felujah to Bagdad. He advocated the route from the Euphrates to the Orontes for communicating with the Mediterranean. • Writing on the 6th April, Colonel Taylor, See Confidential British political agent at Bagdad, said Plint 9:,05 ' P- 203 - I expect shortly to hear of the arrival of the 'Nimrod' and the ' Nitocris' at Ilillah; the 'Assyria' will start for the Hai Canal, the Lower Euphrates, and the Karun River as soon as the rise in the river permits.'

They imported and employed large teak vessels, having a British register, carrying from 80 to 100 tons of merchandise. These were tracked by fifteen to twenty men escorted by a like number of guards. They used the British flag on these boats. 1842. —On the 24ith February Colonel Taylor reported that the ' Steamer ' Euphrates' is still at Magill, the 4 Assyria' left this, Bagdad, for Bussorah. The ' Nitocris ' and ' Nimrod ' are still on the upper Euphrates.' The Government of India withdrew three of these vessels on the 13th May, the 29th June, and the 13th August for service on the Indus. The ' Nitocris' alone remained in Meso potamia, and she was placed at the disposal of the political agent in Turkish Arabia. The contemporary precis writer states that: ' During this time [i .e., 1839-1842) the steamers carried the mails regularly to Bagdad, and on several occasions proceeded far beyond this city without meeting with any objections on the part of the Turkish authorities.'

Canning, 'The single steamer .... is just returned Qrtobtr21, 1842, from a periodical trip to Hussorali, in which, at the request of the Pasha, she conveyed to his destination the new Governor of Bussorah.' Messrs. Hector (a British firm established at Bagdad) complained that Arab sheikhs at different points on the banks of the river levied dues on boats which they had hired from native owners; these dues were a species of black mail. This complaint raised again the question of the dues to be paid on shipping on tbe rivers of Mesopotamia (see Library memorandum No. 10090, Confidential, of July 25, 1912.) Colonel Taylor, in reporting this complaint, stated that Messrs. Hector had a country boat of their own, which was subject to this exaction, and in this connection he asked for the Ambas sador's views of the right of British subjects to purchase or own native boats in the pashalic, ' as the present is the first instance of the fact.' Colonel Taylor added that Messrs. Hector ex pected a steamer from London at Bussorah and desired it to ascend the river as far as Bagdad, and he also requested the Ambassador's instruc tions as to the course he should pursue if this were prohibited. ^ir 8. Canning replied at length respecting the subject of the dues, and added that he conceived that, by virtue of the most-favoured nation clauses in existing treaties with the Porte, no exception could justly be taken to the navigation of the river above Bussorah by British merchant steam-vessels. Sir S. Canning added, 'On the whole I do not see how we are to escape from the con clusion that, although a British merchant-vessel whether navigated by sail or steam, is entitled to ascend the river above Bagdad, no native-built vessel is exempt from payment of the dues re . t ! rr ! d . t0 in consider ation of its being laden with British goods or owned by a British subject so long as the existing demand is levied equally upon all loaded boats, nor do I think we could with prudence advance such a claim to exemp- rr:. m faV0Ur 0f a vessel navigating Enclosure in Sir S.

In September 1845 Colonel Rawlinson, refer ring to a Turkish demand, described the Qalibiyeh as a tax imposed about twenty years before upon river craft to supply funds for the repair of the bridge, and he stated that, being remunerative, the tax was incorporated in the established sources of revenue. Later, in the same despatch, he refers to this question in the following passage :— 44 The river boats belonging to British mer chants at Bagdad are employed in two different species of traffic. During the favourable season they convey native produce to Bussorah for exportation and return with cargoes of British goods, while, at other times, they are made use of to supply the town with firewood, salt and other articles of daily consumption which are found on the banks of the lliver Tigris. ' The Qalibiyeh (Kalibiyeh) duty is applied in different proportions to every trip which such a boat mav make, it is calculated in reference to distance and tonnage and may be assumed, therefore, to be levied on the cargo rather than the vessel' Major Rawliuson, No. 46,- November 12, 1845. See Letter Book, Foreign Office, Archives, No. 196, vol. xxvii, p. 202. Major Ravvlinson, No. 47, November 25, 1845 ' Appendix VIII. The dispute over dues appears to have con tinued, and Major Bawlinson, acknowledging the receipt of a despatch from the Ambassador (No. 2, October 20, 1845), which transmitted a vizierial letter directing the discontinuance of the Kalibiyeh duty, said that the Vali of Bagdad intended to defend the kalibieh duty. He added that he heard that the iurkish. authorities intended to demand that the iurkish flag should in all cases be substituted lor the British flag on boats and vessels belonging to British merchants. (See Appendix VII.) On the 25th November, 1845, Major llawlinson informed Sir S. Canning that a schooner, the &lt;c Kerbelai,' had been built at Bombay by a merchant of that place expressly for the naviga-tion of the rivers of Mesopotamia, that it had 1845— actually arrived at Bussorali, and that its owners had claimed the right of ascending the Tigris under British colours and Iree ol ah demands from the Arabs. The pasha was informed, and, though in his reply he questioned the right of any British vessel to navigate the river except under special firman from the Porte, he said he would not, pending a reference to the Porte, interfere with the voyage- of the ' Kerbelai,' provided that she went above the port of Bussorah at her own risk and under Turkish colours. With regard to the payment of dues to the Arabs, Major Hawlinson was ready to give way, but, after Turkish boats possessed by British owners or owners under British protection had been permitted for a period of forty years to navigate the river under British colours, he ex pressed himself as repugnant, in the case of a British boat, to acknowledge the right of the Bagdad Government to demand the substitution of the Turkish for the British flag. 1846. —In consequence of these continual 1846. disputes, Sir S.

Canning's despatch No. 2 of the 25th March, 1846, and a copy of the vizierial letter of the 2nd April. (Appen dix XI, No. 2.) In March 3 846 Major Eawlinson spoke of sending the ' Nitocris ' to Mosul, and later on he announced that she would start on the 2nd April. In his instructions to Lieutenant Jones, the commander of the ' Nitocris,' Major Eawlinson laid stress upon the political importance of ascend ing the river in order to preserve the right to ascend the Tigris which had been granted by special firman to British war-vessels. The ''Nitocris' failed in the attempt as she was only able to go a few miles north of Tekrit owing to the strength of the current. In April 1846 Major Eawlinson reported the visit to Bagdad of Count Medem, lately Eussian Minister at Tehran, and he stated that he had travelled by river from Bussorah to Nejef by a boat carrying the Eussian flag at the masthead, and that he had been received with full honours by all the Turkish officials.

In forwarding this despatch to the Board of Control Lord Palmerston impressed on the Board the cogency of Major Rawlinson's views. In a letter from the British merchants, enclosed in Major Hawlinson's above quoted despatch No. 7, they call attention to the fact that river craft afford our only means of conveyance,' and they speak of the war steamers constantly running between Bagdad and Bussorah. In 1847 the Governor-General of India decided to direct the return of the ' Nitocris, ,? after being repaired, to the River Euphrates. On the 4th September, 1848, a vizierial letter was addressed to the Governor of Mosul allowing British merchants to construct and employ rafts (' kelek '), notwithstanding the monopoly theu in existence, for the transport of their merchan dise by the Tigris from Mosul to Bagdad on the payment of the same dues as native con structors. This was in accordance with the treaty of 1838 (articles 2 and 4), which w-as then in force. In 1848 claims were put forward by the local authorities for the payment of the Galibiyeh (Qalibiyeh) duties on native built boats owned by Messrs. Lynch and used by them for navi gating the Tigris. In 1850 allusion is made to the navigation of the Upper Tigris and the River Zab by Messrs. Hector's rafts. [163] E14 1851. —Some British merchants in 1851 com plained of the insecurity of the lliver Tigris as affecting the trade carried on in Turkish built boats owned by them. In August Captain Kemball forwarded corre spondence with Messrs. Hector, who had enquired whether an iron vessel built in England and brought out in pieces and put together at Bussorah would be exempt from river dues, nnd could be employed in internal trade. Captnin Ivemball referred Messrs. Hector to Major Rawlinsons circular of 184-6 (see above), and said that be believed it still repre sented the facts of the case. He thought that Messrs. Hector's iron ship would not be exempt from all dues. In February 1852, Colonel Rawlinson enclosed a report from Commander Jones of the 'Nitocris ' on his return from Bussorah to Bagdad, in which it is mentioned that the Pasha, Governor of Bussorah, intended to maintain Turkish steamers on the river. Colonel Rawlinson stated his reasons for thinking Her Majesty's Government should not accede to the request of the Porte for the loan ot British officers and artificers for the erection and maintenance of two armed steamers on the Euphrates and Tigris, which were being sent out in pieces from Liverpool. His main grounds of objection were that the possession of efficient war steamers on the river would render the Turks difficult to manage in commercial matters, and that Her Majesty's Government would become embroiled with the Arabs living on the banks. Colonel Rawlinson stated that Messrs. Hector had again raised the question of bringing out an iron steamer and cargo bo hut that the firm were not sure what transit dues they would hare to pay. Colonel Rawlinson referred to the arrangement of 1846, hy which e said that Sir S. Canning 'ohtained, or thought he had obtained,' the right for British sea-going vessels to he subject only to an anchorage fee. Colonel Rawlinson said that however, in the vizierial letter of 1846,' a clause had been inserted which rendered the Porte's concession nugatory, for the Tigris was erro neously assumed to he a river navigable by 1851 Captain Kemball, No. 22, August 13. 1851, Archives, vol. 367 Captain Kemball to Sir S.

Hector therefore desired that the Porte should grant them an exemption from the transit dues levied on native craft. Colonel Hawlinson concluded by remarking that he thought it would be better to take up the broad ground that British vessels loaded with British goods were on a different footing from native craft, and that no distinction should be made between a British merchant-vessel steaming from the sea up to Bagdad, or transhipping her cargo at the mouth of the river into another British vessel. Colonel Rose, i n October 1852, Colonel Rose, then acting ^ o 108 Octob3r 'l5, 1852 as His Majesty's charge d'affaires at Con stantinople forwarded to the Eoreign Office a despatch addressed to Colonel Hawlinson in reply to his No. 2 L of the 27th July, in which he transmitted a vizierial letter directing that a stop should be put to the abuse of the illegal levy of transit dues or tolls on British goods between Bussorah and Bagdad. Colonel Bose in his despatch referred to the British right to navigate the Mesopotamian rivers in the following terms :— . 'There is doubt in some quarters as to the right of foreign Powers to navigate with their own vessels a Turkish river of which both banks are Turkish. The firman for Colonel Chesney's navigation of the Euphrates was not granted as a right. The Porte allows Austrian steamers to carry goods and passengers on the Danube where both banks of it are Turkish, but Austria acknowledges the Turkish right by asking for permission to navigate We, of course, have the same rights as Austria.' To Colonel Rose, In reply. Colonel Hose was referred to Sir S. November 11 Canning's despatches Nos. 45 and 53 of 1846, 1852. regarding the arrangement he had made with the Porte. Colonel Rose, Colonel B J ose, however, pointed out that the No • 15 ? , „ arrangement of 1846 had proved nugatory, and December 7, 1852. 0 A ^ ^ that there was a difference between the tenor ot Sir S. Canning's despatch to Colonel Rawlinson in 1846 and that of the yizierial letter which was then sent. He considered that a mistake had been made because the memorandum forwarded to the Porte, in consequence of which the vizierial letter was written, was couched in terms similar to those used in the vizierial letter and differed16 from the version given by Sir S. Canning. In 1852—(conf.) his despatch No. 53 ot 184() both these doeu- ments stipulated that British merchant \essels cominsr only from the sea or from foreign countries and proceeding up the Tigris or Euphrates and returning to the sea were to pay the import and export duties prescribed by the tariff. He thought the confusion made between goods and vessels had prevented an earlier removal of the vexatious duties, and he based his demand on the Turkish Government for their abolition on the right possessed by British goods however conveyed. He also obtained the inser tion in the vizierial letter* of an order that the *[ N ote .

This request d T e Kedcliffe, was referred to India, and Colonel Rawlinson June 22, 1853. was informed that the object of the supreme Government was to cultivate friendly relations with the Turkish Government and the Arabs, that 'the use of the steamer is to that end, and that she ought not to be employed in hostilities, even at the request of that Government, except under very special circumstances.' 1854.

(Archives). Sir H. Bulwer apparently replied on the 13th February, 1860, in his No. 1 (which cannot, Sir H. Bulwer, however, be found), respecting Messrs. Lynch's proposal to place a steamer on the Tigris, and (Archives), the substance of this despatch was communi cated to Messrs.

Messrs. Stephen Lynch and Co. (who were Messrs.

Later, they forwarded to the Foreign Office Messrs. Lynch, a copy of a letter from Her Majesty's acting June 2 - consul-general to their Bagdad agent, in which Mr. Hyslop said :— ' The vizierial letter of 1846, on which Major RawliDson's circular of the 12th September, 4() (Appendix XI (No. 2) ), was founded, cannot e considered as conferring any permanent right. 1 er Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople,19 1860— (cont.) looking on it as a document giving merely a tem porary permission which might at any time be re voked by another document of a similar character, does not deem it safe for you to engage your capital in the navigation of the rivers of Mesopotamia until you have received from the Porte some special sanction to that effect. I am happy to inform you, however, that the Ottoman Minister for foreign Affairs has acquainted his Excellency Sir H.

Messrs. Lynch stated that their agents at Bagdad had informed them that the local Government would oppose their enterprise, and that Colonel Kemball had raised the question whether ' steamers could be considered British vessels, though built in England, if put up at Bussorah &gt;f ; f.nd had renewed the suggestion that Messrs. Lynch should obtain the special sanction of the Porte. Messrs. Lynch requested that the Ambas sador should be instructed to afford them help. The Law Officers were asked whether British vessels, built in England and afterwards re constructed at Bussorah, would be rightly held to be bond fide British ships. The Law Officers replied in the affirmative, and Messrs. Lynch were informed that His Majesty's Ambassador would be instructed to insist on this. The correspondence was forwarded to Sir H. Bulwer, and he was told that Her Majesty 's Government did not doubt that the Porte would faithfully carry out the arrangement of 1846, ' by which the right of navigating the waters in question under the protection of the British flag was secured to British subjects,' and that no action was necessary ; ' but that if, nevertheless, any circumstances which have arisen since the conclusion of the above-men tioned arrangement should lead your Excellency to consider it requisite to obtain some further-yi ■ ' 20 security for Messrs. Lynch, [ should not disap prove of your applying to the Porte to grant it. Messrs. Lynch enquired whether they- might commence the construction of the vessels or whether it was advisable to wait for the issue of a special firman. They were told that a copy of their letter would be scut to Sir IT. Bulwer, but Lord John Russell, Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs, declined to express any opinion on its contents. * In April and August Mr. Ilyslop reported the presence of two Turkish steamers, the ' Bagdad ' and ' Bussorah,' which were employed in towing boats and as merchant vessels on the Mesopo- tamian rivers, and were armed with light guns. In December Mr. Ilyslop reported that the duties, hitherto levied on the Eivers Euphrates and Tigris in the Montefik country, had been abolished. 1861. —Sir H.

The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, who had been granted a subvention from the Indian Government for the carriasre of O mails, proposed to put a second steamer on the Tigris, but the project was opposed by Namick Pasha on the ground that, as the ' Comet' and 'City of London' were then on the river, the new vessel would be in excess of the number (two) alluded to in the vizierial letter of January 1861. Representations were made to the Porte on the subject by Mr. Stuart, charge d'affaires at Constantinople, and a note was received from tbe Turkish Minister for Eoreign Affairs (dated the 1st October, 1864) granting permission for a new steamer to navigate the Tigris in place of the ' Comet,' and ' repeating the condition attached to the original grant that no more than two British steamers should at one time ply on the river.' Mr. Stuart pointed out to the Porte that it was not intended that the new steamer^ the ' Dijleh,' should replace the ' Comet,' and obtained permission for the pro visional retention of the latter until thecompletion of the line of telegraph between Bagdad and Fao. Her Majesty's Government were of opinion, how ever, that tbe 'Comet ' ought to be allowed to remain permanently, and Mr. Stuart was so informed. With reference to the Porte's note giving per mission for the employment of the ' Dijleh,' it was pointed out to Mr. Stuart that no mention was made in the arrangement of 1846 of the number of vessels allowed to navigate the rivers of Mesopotamia, and that the vizierial letter of January 1861, confirmatory of that arrangement, gave permission for two steamers to be stationed on the Euphrates, but did not state that the number was to be limited. He was instructed to report whether the original agreement or any written agreement could be construed as bearing out the Porte's contention that the vessels to be employed w r ere restricted to two or any other specified number. Mr. Stuart reported that ' Count Pisani (first dragoman) informed him that there was no trace in the archives of the embassy of any written agreement having been signed by Sir Stratford [163] F*U::. 20 B Canning with the Turkish Government in 1846 1864—(coni.) relative to the navigation of the Mesopotamian rivm by MM Stuart rMrt S out, however, that Sir S.

He added, ' There is no sign, as far as I am informed, of this limitation (i.e., that of 1884) having been renewed in 1816, nor can I find any other foun dation for the assertion of the Ottoman Govern ment that the number of vessels to be so eni- j • i j &gt; j i t [ N ote .—No instructions to question this ployed has heen restricted, t assertion seem to have been sent in reply to this despatch, and Mr. Plowden, in his No. 2, Commercial, of March 28, 1881, stated that in 18154 the Porte asserted for the first time that, under existing firmans, only two British steamers were permitted to navigate the Tigris, and the persistency with which they had reiterated this assertion had apparently ended in securing its undisputed acceptance.] Mr. Stuart reported that the French Govern- Mr Stuart, ment had applied for permission for two French steamers to ply on the Tigris on the same con ditions as the English. He added that the Porte were annoyed but thought that the request could not be refused. In connection with this application, Mr. Stuart Mr - Stuart, No. 119 took the opportunity to discuss with the Turkish November 29. Grand Yizier and Minister for Foreign Affairs the question of opening the Euphrates and Tigris to the commerce of all nations. Mr. Stuart reported that he had been Mr. Stuart, informed by the consul-general at Bagdad, December 20. with reference to the proposed withdrawal of the Satellite' (see later, p. 21, under 1S65) and &lt;{ Comet,' that Namick Pasha pro posed to form a company for navigating the rivers under the French flag, but added that * ( Aali Pasha, Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated that he had not granted the appli cation of the French Government for two steamers to navigate the Mesopotamian Rivers upon the same terms as the two English steamers, although it would be impossible for the Porte to withhold that permission.' Mr. Stuart also said that the Porte had consented to allow the ' Comet' to remain provisionally under Colonel Kemball s orders'for services in con nection with the erection and maintenance of the telegraph.Law Officers, June 14. 1865. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, February 20,1865. liuciitlieT To Mr. Stuart, No. 55, February 23. Mr. Stuart, No. 123, March 14, In June of this year the question, whether the right of navigating the rivers and canals of the Ottoman Empire was secured to the British flag under the most-favourcd-nation clause, and several stipulations of certain treaties between Turkey and foreign Powers, was submitted to the Law Officers of the Crown in connection with the formation of an international transport company in Egypt, and was answered by them in the negative. 1865. —The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navi gation Company informed the Foreign Office that their steamer ' City of London ' had broken down, and requested that permission should be obtained for the substitution of Her Majesty's ship ' Satellite ' for the carriage of the mails—a permission which Namick Pasha had refused to grant to their local agent. Mr. Stuart was instructed to urge the Porte to order Namick Pasha to permit Her Majesty's ship ' Satellite ' to run. Mr. Stuart reported that in an interview with Aali Pasha he had urged him not to insist on the withdrawal of the 'Comet' and 'Satellite,' and that he had left a memorandum (see Appendix XV) with him to remind him of the rights claimed by Her Majesty's Government. Aali Pasha had promised to consider it, and had said that regulations were being drawn up for the navigation of the Tigris and the Euphrates, which would, he hoped, be found satisfactory by Her Majesty's Government, and which he would shortly be in a position to communicate. Mr. Stuart added that, with reference to the case of the 'Comet' and the 'Satellite,' Aali Pasha maintained that, though the rivers might be opened to the merchant-vessels, the Porte could not be expected to admit the ships of war of foreign Governments into the inland waters of Turkey. As this view seemed to Mr. Stuart ' reasonable enough in principle,' he said that he ' thought it more prudent to suggest that the 4 Comet' and ' Satellite' should chiefly on account of their services to the Ottoman Government, be permitted to remain on the rivers on the same footing as formerly, until it might suit the con venience of His Majesty s Government to withdraw one or both vessels, than to raise the question of their right to remain there as ships oelonging to Her Majesty.'

Mr. Stuart's language in No. 123 was approved, To Stuart, and he was told to express to the Forte the hope of Her Majesty's Government that the arrange ments then under consideration for the na\iga- tion of the Tigris and Euphrates would result in throwing open those rivers generally to the ♦ merchant-vessels of all nations. Mr. Stuart reported that he had read to Aali Mr. Stuart, Pasha the Foreign Office despatch No. 119, and Ap'riiu. that the latter had replied that ' the draft of the new regulations for the navigation of the rivers required some alteration belore he would be able to communicate it.' Lord Lvons, Ambassador at Constantinople, Lord Lyons, ' _ , , No. 36, transmitted despatches from the consul-general November 22. at Bagdad giving reasons why he was opposed to the withdrawal of the Cornet.' He also gave a history of Her Majesty's ship Satellite, from which it appears that she was originally brought to Turkish Arabia by Colonel Stewart in company with the vessels engaged in laying the cable, though he did not state in what year. —The consul-general at Bagdad reported 1866. on the 8th August that Namick Pasha had Sir Arnold ordered three steamers from Europe for the usts ostensible purpose of establishing steam com- (enclosure in munication between Kalaa Jebir and Mujdam on Na SSO, 008 ' the Euphrates, and Bagdad and Mosul on the 8 ' Tigris, but really to drive the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's boats off the river.

Sir A.

Euphrates and . Tigris Steam Navigation Company, April 26. To Mr. Elliot, No. 36, Commercial, May 17. 1869. —This year was occupied with a corre spondence with Constantinople and the India Office on the necessity of keeping a Government vessel on the Tigris, on the replacement of the ' Comet' by a newer vessel, and on the question of asking Turkish permission for the change. Mr. Elliot, Ambassador at Constantinople, transmitted a note verbale from the Porte saying that it consented ' au remplacement par un autre navire du batiment de la Marine Royale 'la Com^te' se trouvant sur les rivieres de Mesopotamie.' Early in the year the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company complained of the ruinous competition resulting from the employ ment of untaxed Turkish Government vessels in the conveyance of merchandise between Bussorah and Bagdad at low freights, and questioned their own liability to pay certain duties hitherto paid by them. In regard to these duties, the company ex plained that, when placing their vessels on the Tigris in 1862, they were anxious to please the local Government and had acquiesced, under protest, in the payment of a heavy tonnage duty called* 4 galibeah ' (''kalibiyeh')levied at Bagdad on native vessels, but from which British vessels had been exempt, and in the payment of import duty on their coal (although only in transit from one British vessel to another) and of 20 per cent, on wood purchased or cut on the banks of the livei for the use of their steamers. Instructions were issued to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Con stantinople to make representations to the Forte on behalf of the company, who were punctually fulfilling obligations to the Indian. Government in respect of their mail contract. In the letter of instructions, Mr. Elliot was informed in at, without pronouncing an opinion as to the justice of the charges complained of, Her Majesty s Government were unwilling to assume that it was the Porte's intention to inflict an injury on the important undertaking carried out by the com-pany. Apparently the Ambassador did not report what action was taken on these instructions. 1870,—The India Office suggested that the 'Comet' should he replaced by a steam launch, but Colonel Herbert, acting consul-general at Bagdad, resisted this proposal and Sir H. Elliot supported him, adding that ' Her Majesty's Government may rest assured that if the ' Comet' were now to be replaced by a steam launch .... it will be altogether vain to attempt to obtain permission for the retention of a larger vessel upon the rivers if its presence were found to be called for.'' Colonel Herbert reported that ' one of the steamers launched at Bussorah last year is now plying on that river' (apparently the Euphrates), 'between Aanah and Belis, and another vessel has been repaired and is being sent on the same service and two large-sized steam launches from England are to follow.' Presumably these were the Turkish company's vessels.* Sir IJ. Elliot, No. 25, May 22, 1870. In the same year the Euphrates and Tigris Company addressed a letter to Lord Granville, praying his Lordship to obtain from the Turkish Government permission for them to send out another A r essel to meet the requirements of their trade, and in this letter they said :— ' The two vessels we already have are supposed to be authorised by special firman, and we are not sure if we have the right to employ a third or more without special permission.'f In this letter it was stated that Midhat Pasha, the successor to Namick Pasha, was favourable to the increase of British steam-vessels on the river. In reference to this request, the India Office pointed out that there were in Turkish waters ' the ful1 ^bers of vessels allowed by special rman.' They stated, however, that they would Colonel Ilerbnrt, No. 9, June 8, * (Enclosure in Sir H. Elliot, -No, 245, * October 24). *[NotK —In a report dated February 15, 1903 (Enclosure in India Office, June 10, 1903), on the navigation of the Euphrates, Mr. H. R. C. Dobbs, political agent to the Government of India, stated that since Colonel Chesney's expedition in 1835-7, no regular attempt had been made to navigate the river by steam until 1870, when the Bagdad Government started a service of two small steamers between Feluja (landing- place for goods for Bagdad, 38 miles distant), and Meskene (landing-place for goods for Aleppo, 50 miles distant). The distance between the two points was about 440 miles, but the vessels occasionally descended the river as far as Hillah. After a year or two the service was discontinued, oue of the vessels being wrecked ; and since the failure of the experiment no steamers had plied on that portion of the Euphrates.] Euphrates and Tigris Company, October 19. 1 [ N ote .—In a Foreign Office memorandum dated November 26, 1870, Mr. A. 'S. Green explained that the company supposed them selves to be limited as to the number of their vessels by the firman of 1834, which was mentioned in the vizierial letter of 1861. The same view seems to have been ^aken by the Ottoman Government and accepted by the British Government (see note on p. 20b ), and has led to some confusion m regard to the authorisation on which the company's privileges were based.

No reply seems to have been returned to the company's application, and ■apparently nothing more was done in regard to it. During the year an examination of the diffi culties in the way of the navigation of the Euphrates was made by an expedition under Midhat Pasha, who was accompanied by Vice- Consul Mayers (Varna). 1873. - — In February (1873) the Governor- General of Bagdad complained that the Mail Com pany {i.e., the Euphrates and Tigris Company) had imported a small steamer to convey passengers from Bussorah to Bagdad, and in his letter to the British vice-cbnsul, he said: 44 The steamers of Messrs. Lynch run, as you know, with per mission.' Objections were raised by the Indian Govern ment to the large subvention (4,800/. a-year) paid to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Naviga tion Company for steam communication (con veyance of mails) between Bussorah and Ba gdad. It was considered undesirable to discontinue the subvention, as, apart from postal considerations, the maintenance of the service was required upon political grounds. In September the company complained that the local authorities at Bagdad objected to their employing a steam-launch on the Tigris for the carrying of the mails when the waters were low; but, on the matter being referred to Constantinople, the Porte gave its consent to the employment of the launch, provided only two steamers were used at one time. This did not satisfy the company, and, on a further reference being made to Constanti nople, the Porte with some reluctance con sented to the employment of the launch on all occasions. J874. —As the orders, however, did not reach Bagdad, a fresh appeal was made to the Porte on the subject, and permission was then sent, by telegraph, to Bagdad for the company's steam- launch to ply between Bagdad and Bussorah during the repair of one of the company's steamers. A correspondence arose this year, out of a visit paid in May 1874 by Her Majesty's ship 'Philomel' to Kurna (situated at the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates), as to the right of [163] H 8526 British ships of war to ascend the Tigris and 1874 (con^.) Euphrates. (See Foreign Office memorandum dated February 8, 3 881, Confidential 480-.) The Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company had requested on the Oth feeptembci, 1873, that permission should he obtained from the Porte for the replacement of one of their steamers (the ''City ol London ), which was worn out, but Mr. Locock, Her Majesty's charge \Ir. Locock, d'affaires at Constantinople, reported that the ^j- a y ^ Porte refused its consent on the ground that there were, &lt;f at that moment, on the Tigris four* instead of the two steam-vessels allowed *[ Note .—The Porte presumably meant the b, .U. «,«.», ..d »•&gt; .» ™ ' D,VBh ' improperly armed as a ship of war and doing duty as a stationnaire attached to the British consulate-general.' To judge from the note verbnle the Porte appeared to think that all four vessels belonged to Messrs. Lynch and to complain that the ' Comet' had been altered to give it the appearance of a man-of-war. Sir II. Elliot transmitted despatches from the Sir H.

Elliot pointed this out to the Porte in a strongly worded note on the 12th July, in which he expressed the hope that the Porte would grant permission for the replacement of the 44 City of London.' In one of these despatches Colonel Herbert « remarked that ' the two steam-vessels of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company are those for the purpose of facilitating com merce specially provided for by the firman of the 29th December, 1834 (confirmed to permit the formation of this company by the vizierial letter of the 15th January, 1861), which does not allude and does not directly apply to Govern ment vessels which are not employed in trade, and one of which the ' Comet,' is retained on these rivers under arrangements between Her Majesty's Government and that of the Sultan, of which no record exists in this office.' Sh A. Kemball, in an undated memorandum (probably written in the June of this year) relative to the questions of the ' Comet' and of the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, wrote in reference to the latter question: £{ The Porte has admitted the right of British merchant vessels to engage in the internal27 1874 Sir H.

The Porte has persistently refused to allow river craft owned by foreigners and carrying a foreign flag to navigate the waters of Mesopotamia or to engage in the internal trade of the country, the three English vessels (river steamers) only excepted.' Sir H. Elliot reported that the Turkish authorities had refused to allow a launch, the property of Messrs. Lynch, to carry passengers between Bussorah and Mohammerah. Its deten tion had been demanded by the Governor of Bussorah, but refused by the vice-consul on the ground' that Bussorah was a free port and Mohammerah foreign territory. In connection with this incident. Sir H. Elliot was instructed that u Great Britain has no treaty stipulations with Turkey giving the right of navigating the internal waters of Mesopotamia.'^ It was held that Her Majesty's Govern ment could not claim a right for this launch to ply unless it came under ' the privilege granted by the vizierial letters of 1834, 1846, 1861,' and, &lt;{ as some doubts may exist as to the vizierial letter of 1846 being still in force, Sii H. Elliot was instructed to ascertain whether the privileges had ever been abrogated. Sir H. Elliot replied that he thought 'it would be unsafe to make any enquiry at the Porte which could be regarded as implying that there was a doubt upon the subject, but that he had alluded to the subject in conversation with Aarify Pasha, Minister for Foreign Affairs, who said he would look into the matter. But his Excellency added: 'If our rights upon these rivers are limited to those granted by the firman and vizierial letters, we do not seem entitled to claim more than the maintenance of the two vessels originally named.' Sir H. Elliot also said that he had heard taat the' Porte were having the whole question examined, and thought that if it was considered that there were sufficient grounds for denying, our right to navigate the rivers, this would be before long officially intimated, and that ther• , vi v • • • ■ • ».•/ •' • * 28 the time would have come for Her Majesty's 1874—(coni.) Governraent to state their views. Meanwhile the launch which had been seized at Bussorah on the 21st August was released on the 26th, on receipt of instructions from ^ lr Elll0t ' Badgad, and was allowed to ply between Bus- Commercial, sorah and Mohammerah without impediment.

Elliot reported that the Porte, 1875. in a note dated the 21st February, had demanded Sir H- Elliot, . , , No. 96, that the ' Comet' should be at once withdrawn February 22,1875. from Bagdad on the ground that she was in excess of the number authorised, and had been metamorphosed so as to. have the appearance of a ship of war. Sir H. Elliot corrected Aali Pasha's misapprehension on the latter point, and the note was withdrawn. Sir H. Elliot added that during his conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, he had been careful not to claim for Her Majesty's Government a right to station a man-of-war in inland waters, but at the same time to let it be understood that a privilege which had been freely granted for so many years could not be suddenly withdrawn without giving cause to Her Majesty's Govern ment to enquire whether the Porte was animated by the same friendly feelings towards Great Britain as formerly. The Porte in this note stated: ' La Com- pagnie Lynch a etc autoris6e par Jirman Imperial a employer deux bateaux a vapeur,' &amp;c., and later, '11 ne serait pas inutile d'ajouter que, pour ce qui est de la navigation sur le Tigre, la Compagnie Lynch pourrait tout au plus ^tendre son service jusqu'a Mahraene * et non * [Note .—This Doint cannot be identified, jusqu 'a Bagdad.' ^ ' but is evidently below Bagdad.] In February 1875 the company renewed their The Euphrates request to be allowed to replace one of their old Steam ^vigation vessels by a new one, and they again stated that their company had been formed on the faith of 6 a firman under which the company was authorised, with the cognisance of the Foreign Office, to employ two steam-vessels on the Euphrates and Tigris.' .

Elliot reported that the Porte had agreed to the replacement of the ' City of London/' and had also granted permission to Messrs. Lynch to employ their steam-launch under exceptional circumstances and when the water was low. In its note the Porte said :— ' La Porte consente a ce que Tun des deux bateaux que Messrs. Lynch emploient en vertu d'un , firman Imperial pour le service des passagers et des marchandises sur le Tigre soit provisoirement remplace par un autre sans que le nombre des navires autorise par le susdit firman puisse etre augmente.' Sir H. Elliot stated that he was informed that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company had ordered a steam-tug and two iron lighters for the service between Bussornh and Mohammerah, and he thought this was im prudent on their part, in view of the fact that their passenger launch only ran on sufferance. Thereupon the company were told that Her Majesty's Government were not prepared to ask for further privileges for them than those which the Porte had already accorded, but in this letter it Avas assumed that the inten tion was to put the lighters on the Tigris and Euphrates. The report, however, was stated by the company to be entirely without foundation, as they ' had no intention of placing either an additional steamer or lighter on those rivers,' nor, as they subsequeutly stated, on the river between Bussorah and Mohammerah. At the same time Colonel Nixon, consul-general at Bagdad, complained that the vice-consul at Bussorah was supporting Messrs. Lynch Brothers, of that town, ' in encroachments upon the Turkish prerogatives respecting the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates.' Various com plaints had been put forward by that firm against the Government of Bussorah, including O two relative to the seizure of their boats at Amarah and to the detention of their steam-launch [163] 1k'}M : ^li , . ... ..

Colonel Nixon wrote, 'We may, of course, de plore the fact that the Turks do not open the rivers to general traffic, but, so long as they are not compelled to do so hy treaty the 1 asha bound to dispute any encroachment on part.' lie stated further that the lurks had established a line of steamers under the title ol the Oman Company, and weie naturally jealous of foreigners running steamers in opposition to it; and he also remarked that the Turkish officials considered that the ' Comet ' (Govern ment steamer), ' City of London, and Dijleh (Messrs. Lynch's steamers) were one in excess of the number originally allowed by the firman of 1834. under which the British Government were permitted to run two steamers on the river. A provisional certificate of registry had been Enclosures granted in 1874 to Messrs. Lynch's launch, and early in 1875 the consul-general at Bagdad and April 8. the vice-consul at Bussorah recommended that authority should be given to the latter to issue passes to tugs, launches, and other craft navi gating the Shatt-el-Arab at Bussorah. This re commendation was forwarded to the Board of Trade, but nothing further seems to have been done in the matter. On the 16th June a contract with the Indian Confidential 4835. Government for the conveyance of mails between Bussorah and Bagdad was signed by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, who received a subsidy of 3,600/. a year for the service. 28/6. —The India Office represented that the 1876 time had come when the Comet ' must be t ^ ,.1 , , . , India Office, replaced, and suggested that the Porte should be June 3,1876. again informed of Her Majesty's Government's intention.

Permission was given for the ' City of 1877. London ' to replace the 'Dijleh' pending the Mr. Jocelyn arrival of a new steamer.

Layard, No. 69, November 4. 7878. —The India Office suggested that an attempt should be made to induce the Porte to allow the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to employ a third steamer for the conveyance of mails between Bagdad and Bussorah, so as to give a weekly service. A copy of their letter was forwarded to Sir H. Layard with instructions not to compro mise, in his application to the Po^te on behalf of the company, the right to maintain a Government vessel on the river. 1879. —Sir H. Layard reported that in March 7878 he had addressed a note to the Porte requesting the issue of a firman for an extra steamer for the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. The Porte refused on the 6th May, 1879, on the ground that the improvements in the service of the Oman Ottoman Company would meet all requirements. This reply was deemed far from satisfactory, more particularly since Messrs. Sassoon had also applied to Lord Salisbury to endeavour to obtain permission to employ one or two suitable steamers on those rivers for the accommodation of p issengers and merchandise. Sir H. Layard observed that the objection of the Porte to granting the permission required was founded on the fact that the steamers would be under the British flag. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company addressed a letter to Lord Salisbury, praying that steps might be taken to induce the Porte to throw the navigation of the rivers open, and in their letter they stated that the company ' by special firman from the Porte, has been engaged since 1861 in the navigation of the rivers Euphrates and Tigris This firman limits the number of vessels to two.' Upon the receipt of this letter a despatcb was addressed to Sir H. Layard, in which he was instructed to remind the' Porte of the numerous appeals which had been made to it by Her Majesty's Government to remove the restrictions which existed on the trade of that part of the Ottoman Empire and upon the development of the resources of the districts adjacent to the Riveis Tigris and Euphrates ; and his Excellency was then told 'to urge most earnestly on the Turkish Government the removal of the restric tions imposed on the navigation of those rivers32 l3y vessels under the British flag. ' Sir If. Layard, 1879 (cont,) however, replied that, considering the suspicious temper of the Porte at that moment, he foil sure November 23. that, if such a demand was then made it would be pretty certain to be refused. In Julv of this year, representations were maue Sir II. Layard, ^ r F0l0 2rr£tOiiic to the Porte, at the instance of the Euphrates and j u iy n 2; No.' 731, Tiariis Steam Navigation Companv and Messrs. 14 5 anci Gray, Dawes, and Co.. respecting the injurious Commercial, effect upon navigation and export trade caused ^ l G * by the erection of a dam on the Tigris below Amarah, for the purpose of flooding rice-fields. The Porte explained that the river had been tem porarily diverted in consequence of drought, and that notice had been given to European and Ottoman navigation companies. 18S0. —In January the Euphrates and Tigris 188(X Steam Navigation company applied to this Euphrates and office for a copy of the ' Imperial lirman bv Steam . » . . Navigation virtue or which that company was authorised to Company, employ steamers on the Rivers Euphrates and Januai T 2 ' 1880 Tigris,' as they stated 41 they had no copy of the document in their office *; whereupon a copy of the firman of 1834 and of the vizierial letters of 1811, i:: '1846, and 1861 (above referred to) were * See note on p. 9. sent to them. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Euphrates and Company stated that they heard from Bagdad Na^gatST that an arrangement had been come to for Company, leasing the Turkish steamers on the Tigris to ' ,lUmary 2 ' some native merchants with a monopoly for fifteen years of the navigation (exception being made in favour of the two British steamers). Sir H. Layard was informed that the Govern ment of India had arranged to send the^Chenab'* to Bagdad as a temporary measure to replace ^ llKJ W&lt;W3 the ' Comet,' and he was instructed to ask ca P 8 i ze d in the Shatt-el-Arab,] the Porte to send instructions to the local authorities. Arrangements had been made in the previous year for a grant of 3,000/. from Imperial funds towards the cost of the new vessel. Sir H. Layard reported that the Dutch Minister sir H. Uyard at Constantinople had demanded of the Porte that s ' Commercial, a Dutch company might, by treaty right, be granted the same privileges as had been conceded to the English, to navigate the rivers of Mesopotamia, and that, as the foreign law oflicers of the Porte had reported the demand to be well founded, a firman to that effect would be issued. ] n Uu s connection Sawas Pasha, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, observed To Sir 11. Layard, No. 42, January 16. * Note.— The ' London ' was eventually — 7 — January 16,33 1880 (cont.} that Holland was tliG only Power wliich had a treaty with the Porte conferring this right. His Excellency added that he had taken the opportunity, in speaking to Sawas Pasha and the Prime Minister upon the subject to urge upon them the importance of throwing open these rivers to steam navigation, so that the trade and resources of Turkey might thereby be developed, that his observations were favourably received, and that a promise was given that the request of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to employ a tuird vessel should be reconsidered. ' In alluding to the proposed leasing of the Turkish vessels the company took the opportunity of renewing their request to be allowed to increase the number of their steamers on those rivers. Sir H. Layard reported that the Minister for Eoreign Affairs had assured him no such monopoly should be granted. The company stated that the Turkish authorities Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, January 17. Sir H. Layard, No. 29, Telegraphic, January 17.

To Musurus Pasha, May 14. had stopped their towing cargo flats, which the company's steamers had apparently been towing since December 1879 in order to relieve the famine raging round Bagdad. The company, however, made no mention of these flats in their letter of the I'ith March, in which they asked that increased facilities should be obtained for them. Sir H. Layard was instructed to do what lie could for the company, ^ seeing that it is not a question of asking for fresh privileges.' Sir IT. Lajard reported that the Porte had sent-orders to the Vali of Bagdad to permit the towing of barges, but the company on the 26th April stated that the Government of Bussorah still refused to permit this. The com pany added, ' cargo boats have from time immemorial been used in the navigation of these rivers, and both tracked by men and on occasions towed by steam-power.' Sir H. Layard made further remonstrances, and on the 13th May Musurus Pasha, Turkish Ambassador in London, stated that orders had been sent by telegraph to the authorities of the vilayet of Bussorah ' afln que les deux bateaux de la Compagnie Lynch puissent remonter des schlepps, des mahonnes, et meme des caics, pourvu quelle consente a transporter des cereales aux endroits ou r^gne ladisette'; to which, however. Lord Granville [163] K34 replied that Her Majesty's Government did not 1880—(con^.) consider that any conditions of that nature could be imposed on the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates by the vessels of the company. The company were informed of this corre- To Euphrates and , , j . .» i. Tigris Steam spondence, and were requested, at the same time, Navigation to explain the precise state of the case as to the employment of barges and boats, other than the two steamers, by the company in the navigation of the rivers. To this the company replied as follows :— Euphrates and 1 J 1 Tigris Steam Navigation ' In reply, I have to inform your Lordship ( 'ompanT, ijla V that both before and after the firman of 1634, granting the right of navigation for two steamers, large boats under the English flag navigated those rivers free from all exactions to which native-owned boats were subjected. In 1846 it was, by order of the Porte, arranged that all these boats employed in internal trade for the transmission of cargo should continue the navi- See vizierial letter gation under their foreign flags, but should pay ^ppendix'x^C 6 )' the same taxes (' droits') as those owned by Ottoman subjects, thus implying and confirming the prescriptive right. ' The injurious effect of this tax was apparent, and all dues, at the instigation of Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, were shortly afterwards entirely abolished. That this arrange ment did not refer to steamers is proved bv the fact that there were at that time no trading steamers on the rivers of Mesopotamia either native or foreign owned. 44 1 am also in a position to state that in 1846, when this question was under consideration, the firm of Messrs. S. Lynch and Co. and others, both Persian and Indian subjects, possessed boats of 150- to iiOO-tons burden navigating the rivers and transporting merchandise, and, since the formation of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Na\ igation Company, the same description of boats, the property of British subjects, have been employed uninterruptedly in conveying coal and firewood for the use of the steamers, and for other purposes, occasionally being towed by the steamers. ' Last year, owing to the low state of the river, and a o.o-scquent cessation of through communi- cahon, which was greatly to the detriment of commerce, my directors decided upon providing steel barges of light draft, never doubting that: ' ■ *: ■ ■ . -- ■ . .. — , 1880— {cont.)

To Mr. Goschen (Constantinople), No. 8, Commercial, May 31. 3-5 tbey might be employed without restriction, as has always been the case with the boats pre viously alluded to. They were accordingly sent out and commenced working last December, being lashed alongside and towed by the company's steamers. No question regarding their employ ment was raised until March, when, in obedience to orders from here, the rate of freight on grain was temporarily reduced to a minimum with a view of alleviating the distress at Bagdad arising from scarcity of food. It was then that their employment was arbitrarily prohibited by the local Turkish authorities, a step which can only be accounted for on the presumption that they view the reduction of freight as detri mental to the pecuniary interests of the Turkish steamers.' On the 24th May the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company wrote again to say that their barges were still detained, and it was then discovered that the telegram had been stopped by the Turkish Prime Minister, in order to bring about a misunderstanding between his colleagues and Sir H. Layard. But Sir H. Layard stated that he had himself telegraphed to Her Majesty's consul-general at Bagdad to inform him that orders had been sent to the Turkish authorities at Bagdad and Bus- sorah to permit the steamers of -the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to tow the company's barges upon the rivers. A few days later the company wrote to say that the pasha had at last permitted the employ ment of the barges, but only temporarily, and they requested that Lord Granville would immediately protest and repudiate the implied authority of the Turkish Government to impose any limitation on their right to employ boats and barges in the navigation of the rivers of Mesopotamia, a right which, so it was asserted, had been enjoyed by all nationalities from time immemorial, and which prohibition, it was argued, could not be enforced on the ground that steel was used in the construction of the boats instead of iron, and that a more expeditious method of towing the barges was adopted in place of the primitive custom of tracking hitherto in vogue. Mr. Goschen (special Ambassador at Con stantinople) was thereupon instructed to ask &lt;*0for an explanation from the Porte with respect to the alleged temporary nature of the per mission for navigation thus granted, and to use his best endeavours to prevent its withdrawal, if such a step were contemplated, pending the discussion on the subject between the two Governments. The company stated that, as the result of the barges resuming work, the price of wheat in Bagdad had fallen 25 per cent. On the 17th June Mr. Goschen sent following telegram to Lord Granville :— the ' Please ask company in London whether permission to use barges is claimed as a right or asked for as a favour.' To which the following reply was returned:— ' Her Majesty's Government regard permission to use barges as a right; but if you are in doubt as to facts of the case, consult consul-general at Bagdad.' The instructions given by the* Porte to the vali were to withdraw the prohibition on barges being towed during the continuance of the famine; but the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company stated in a subsequent letter that 44 they had, on very good authority, the confirmation of their right to employ iron and steel barges and to have them towed by steamers on the Tigris and Euphrates,' but they did not state what that authority was. On the 16th December, however, Assim Pasha sent a note to Mr. St. John, Her Majesty's charge d'affaires, in answer to Mr. Goschen's enquiries respecting Messrs. Lynch's position on the Mesopotamian rivers, in which he said;— La navigation de 1 Euphrate n^est point ouverte aux pavilions strangers, et que c'est en vertu d'un firman special qu'il a conc6d6 k MM.

Upon which Mr. Goschen was instructed to do what he could in the matter, u as the stoppage of the barges was Opposed to the welfare of the country and the interests of the Porte,' and the company were so informed. Mr. Goschen reported that Mr. St. John had explained to Assim Pasha the views of Her Majesty's Government that ' until better pro spects of a harvest appeared to warrant the suppression of the means of transporting grain to the famine-stricken districts, where so much relief was afforded last year, it seemed the height of imprudence to enforce the prohibition'; and that Assim Pasha had promised to lay the matter before the Prime Minister. Mr. Goschen also asked whether Her Majesty's Government had recognised the right of the company to employ barges on the River Euphrates, and suggested that, if not, the company should be so informed. A memorandum on the subject was written by Sir E. Hertslet (Confidential 4439), in which he stated that the only right which the company could have to navigate the ivlesopo- tamian rivers was derived from the firman of 1834 and the vizierial letters of 1846 and 1861. Mr. Plowden reviewed the correspondence in the archives, and came to the following conclu sions : — ' 1. The British Government have under the firmans of 1834 and 1841, which have been [163] L38 confirmed by the vizierial letters of 1861 and 1881—(coTrt. 1862, the right, subject to certain specified con ditions, to navigate the Euphrates 4 for purposes of trade.' ' 2. Under the arrangement of 1846, also con firmed in the vizierial letters of 1861 and 1862, British merchants are at liberty to navigate the Euphrates and Tigris under the British flag and without restriction as to the number or description of the vessels employed, subject only to the payment of the stipulated dues. ' 3. That the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company have no firman granting them an exclusive privilege to navigate the Tigris with two, and only two, steamers. Their rights really depend on the arrangement of 1846, and so far are neither greater nor less than those which may be claimed by any British merchant.' The company again protested against their Euphrates aud barges being stopped, and said ''our right is founded on the vizierial letter of the 2nd April, Company, April 2. 1846, confirming a right which we long previously enjoyed; the words are * que les btUiments anglais peuvent faire le commerce dans les deux fleuves susmentionnes en payant les droits dtablis par lo traits.' This cannot allude to steamers .... as our right for them is founded on another firman* for commercial purposes .... * [Note .—Preenmably the but this argument we deem scarcely necessary, 18 leielie d to.] as we have already enjoyed the right of using boats and barges (' Mtiments, navires et barques') on both rivers.' Sir J. Pauncefote thought the vizierial letter Foreign Office of the 2nd April, 1846, somewhat ambiguous. ^ e °| 0 ^ ndum ' He said that it might be contended that it admitted the general right of navigation for British vessels, or per contra that it merely regulated, the duties leviable on British vessels which might ' d^sormais' navigate the rivers with lawful permission of authority. The memorandum drawn up by Sir E. To Mr. Goschen, Hertslet on the 27th March was transmitted to ? 0 ' 44, . , Commercial, Mr. Goschen, and he was informed that the May 16. general right to navigate the rivers of the Ottoman Empire under the British flag was not secured to British subjects by treaty, and was instructed to point out to the Porte that the present question only referred to barges, and that the right to use them seemed to be confirmed by1881— (conf.) the vizierial letter of 1846, whatever might be the effect of that arrangement as regards merchant vessels. Mr. Plowden, in his correspondence with the Vali of Bagdad, laid stress on the right of Messrs. Lynch to use their steamers in any way they pleased, including the towing of barges, on the ground that the use to be made of the steamers was nowhere specifically limited. Lord Dufferin, Ambassador at Constantinople, reported that he had acted on the instructions sent to Mr. Goschen in No. 44 of the 16th May,, and that his representations had been favourably received. The Law Officers were asked— Enclosure in Consul-General Plowden, No. 4, Commercial, May 31. Lord Dufferin (Constantinople) No. 68, Commercial, July 25. To Law Officers, September 17.

The Law Officers answered that they did not think any general right could be claimed under the 1846 arrangement, but thought the company could probably include in their rights the towing of barges.* Their opinion was subsequently somewhat modified as a result of fuller informa tion, as will be seen in their report of 188 L Lord Dufferin reported that the Ministerial Council had acceded in principle to Her Majesty's Government's demands on behalf of Messrs. Lynch's barges, and the company were informed. Considerable correspondence passed during this and the previous year relative to an attack made in July 1880 by Arabs of the A1 Bu Mahommed tribe under Sheikh Seyhood, upon the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's steamer ' Khalifah,'^ near Amarah (between Bagdad and Kurna). The vessel was, at the time, engaged in carrying mails from Bussorah. It was proposed, in consequence of this incident, that a British gun-boat should be sent up the Tigris, and a memorandum was prepared by the librarian of the Foreign Office as to the right of British ships of war to go up the Tigris and Euphrates. In July a communication was re ceived from the Porte, stating that it had not been the practice for foreign ships of war to proceed further up-stream than Kurna, and so far40 only after receiving permission, and begging that 1881 —(con^.) in future British ships of war should not go further. The Foreign Office and India Office 'i'o India Office, . . . . m 111 * i i i.i August 31. agreed that instructions should be issued by the [ nf ji a office, Admiralty in coinidiance with the Porte's September 9. request. • As regards the attack on the ' Khalifah,' instructions were sent to the Ambassador at Con- To Mr. Goschen, stantinople to demand proper punishment of the \ persons concerned in the outrage, or compensation for the sufferers. The India Office, when con- India Office, curring in the instructions, referred to the fact lM ' l)ruai T 24 ' ' that the right of British subjects to navigate the inland waters of Turkish Arabia was not secured by any treaties, but rested on the firman of 1834, .... which appeared to be revocable in the event of inconvenience arising from the concession,' This passage was conveyed to the Ambassador in a separate despatch, and he was To Mr. Goschen, told to bear it in mind when acting upon the in- 1 1 4 *; . or March 3. structions given respecting the ' Khalifah' case. Consul-General Plowden, writing on the ques- Enclosure in tion of the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab by x/' British ships of war, suggested that the ' Comet' December 18. should be replaced by a vessel of the Royal Navy for the better protection of British trade on the Mesopotamian rivers. 1S82. —The Ambassador at Constantinople con- 1882. sidered the moment to be inopportune for pressing Lord Duff e rin » Consul-General Plowden's suggestion upon the January 3,1882. Porte. This view was concurred in by the India India Office, Office, who, at the same time, stated that a 1 ^' l)ruary 8 ' steamer had been specially constructed at Bombay to replace the « Comet,' but on com pletion in 1881 its draught of water had been found excessive for the purpose for which it was designed. The importance of providing a suitable vessel was pointed out to the Indian Government. Before the ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Slave Trade Convention, signed on the 25th To Lord Dufferin, January, 1880, the Porte wished to come to a N^MayV clear understanding with regard to the words 44 eaux mt^neures ' (Prench version), or ' inland waters of the Ottoman Empire,' occurring in paragraph 5 of article 6. They contended that the English phrase should be translated as ' eaux temtonales,' which was the meaning of the words used in the Turkish text. In reply to this contention, it was explained that the phrase inland waters' was used in order to give the right to the Turkish authorities to detain British41 13 1882— {cont.) vessels usin^ inland waters such as the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and did not give the right to British war-ships to examine vessels in such rivers. The Turkish GoverDment considered that the words ' eaux int^rieures' applied to such waters as the Sea of Marmora, the Dardanelles, and the Bosphorus, but not to rivers. Finally, the words were omitted from the treaty alto gether. Lord Dufferin stated that he was forced to the conclusion that the Sultan did not intend to grant the company's request for permission to tow barges, and he thought that a possible reason was the fear of the Sultan that the 'barges might be converted into instruments of war. 1883. —In reply to representations made by Mr. Lynch, an explanation of the delay in the settlement of the question relative to the towing of barges was given to the company. Lord Dufferin, No. 86, Commercial, March 23. 1883. To Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, February 9, 1883. Acting Consul-General Tweedie (Bagdad), No. 14, June 15. Mr. Wyndham (Constantinople), No. 147, June 15. Colonel Tweedie, acting consul-general at Bagdad, reported that the vali had informed him that the Lynch steamers would be prohibited from plying on the Tigris on the ground that their privilege applied only to the Euphrates. A long correspondence arose out of this action by the Porte, which was caused apparently by the launch of a new steamer by Messrs. Lynch (to replace one of the old ones). The Porte asserted that the dimensions of the vessel exceeded the limits alleged to have been been laid down in various vizierial letters, though Mr. Wyndham, charge d'affaires at Constantinople, pointed out to the Porte that no limits had ever been placed on the size of the boats, and that the privileges of the company did not rest on vizierial letters, but on &amp; firman. Mr. Plowden sent in a memorandum on the question pointing out the mistake that had been made in the negotiations of 1864, in letting the fundamental argument of the Porte, that Lynch and Company's rights were based on the firmans (1834 and 18il) cited, to pass unrefuted. In a -note verbale to the Porte dated the 25th April, the embassy stated ;— „ „ . n ' C'est en vertu d'un firman Imperial accorde [N ote .—Mr. Wyndham here fell into the 1-,^ /ion\ a •• error foreseen by Consul-General Plowden — en 1257 (1811), et non pas par des lettres tizi- of misinterpreting the mention of Lieutenant r ielles, que la Compagnie Lynch a obtenu Lynch in the firman of 1841.] Consul-General Plowden, Memorandum.

In a further note to Aarify Pasha dated the 20tli June, 1883, Mr. Wyndham stated that ' the restriction as regards the number of vessels to be employed is being faithfully recognised and no advantage is being taken of the latitude allowed by the vizierial letter of the 31st March, 1875. (See ante, p. 29). Finally, on the 22nd June, 1883, Mr. Wyndham stated in a note to the Porte;— ' II resulte de cette situation que le droit de la Compagnie Lynch .... a 6te pleinement etabli et reconnu en vertu de deux lettres vizirielles adressees au Vali de Bagdad, en date du 3 Rejeb, 1277 (1861), et du 15 novembre, 1873.' 1883—(con^.) Enclosure 11. Enclosure 12. [Note .—The English case would appear to have been seriously weakened by these three comnmnications, whose inconsistency is apparent. There is no information in the correspondence to explain Mr. Wyndham's reference to a vizierial letter of the 15tli November, 1873.] On the 30th Juno Mr. Wyndham reported that, having been informed by the consul-general June 30. at Bagdad that the Vali had prevented the com pany's steamer from loading and clearing, he had made verbal representations to the Porte on the subject; and, in a later telegram he proposed to supplement these representations by a written Jul/2. communication. In his telegram of the 30th June he stated that ' the navigation of the Tigris appears to have been allowed till now by virtue of vizierial letters, that on the Euphrates by firman;' and he added, in his telegram of the 2ud July ;— u I think we must only claim permission to navigate the Tigris as a privilege and not as a right, it having been granted by vizierial letter, and not by firmau, as in the case of the Euphrates.' The vali continued his interference, and even w^ent so far as to place Turkish soldiers on one of the company s steamers. A formal protest was pasha^July 11. in consequence addressed to Musurus Pasha, in which Her Majesty's Government's rights as against the Porte for the consequences of these proceedings were reserved, and Mr. Wyndham ^if^hlc dbam, w as instructed to hold similar language to the July^il.

In the course of further representations made to the Porte by Mr. Wyndham, personally and through Sir A. Sandison, first embassy dragoman, the Turkish Ministers referred to a threat to send a British gun-boat up the Shatt-el-Arab, and implied that it would be better to prohibit the running of the company's steamers rather than have the risk of such a contingency. Mr. Wyndham explained to the Forte that the idea emanated from the consul-general at Bagdad, in view of the danger which British steamers incurred from attacks of Arabs, and said that, if the Ottoman Government looked upon it as a viola tion of the law of nations, he felt sure Her Majesty's Government would not adopt any measure which he considered as such. With reference to the question of navigation of the Mesopotamian rivers, Mr. Wyndham called the Porte's special attention to the arrangement of 1846, and fur nished them with copies of the vizierial letters of 1846 and 1861, pointing out that according to their terms there was no limitation as to the number and size of the vessels or boats under the British flag which had received permission to navigate or to engage in trade in those rivers. He feared, however, that in view of the corre spondence of 1873 and 1874, it would be difficult to induce the Porte to allow the company to run a greater number of vessels, than they had done hitherto. Mr. Kennedy, head of the Commercial Depart ment of the Foreign Office, wrote a memorandum giving a summary of the case, and Mr. Piowden added certain observations, in which he pointed out that the company had not been averse to seeing the arrangement of 1846 kept in the back ground and the firman of 1834 relied on, as by the latter with their two ships they might claim a monopoly of navigation as against other foreign vessels. The Porte replied that on examination the c'ase was as follows :— Foreign Office memorandum, July 20 [Confidential 4838]. Communicated by Musurus Pasha, July 24 (Appendix XIX). ' Deux firmans emanes successivement ' (pre sumably those of 1834 and August 1841) ' con- fdrent a la Compagnie Lynch, a des conditions parfaitement determinees, le privilege de faire. naviguer, a tour de r61e, deux bateaux a vapeur dans I'Euphrate seulement.' ■r f A)' 1 n v 44 I. f Tlie Turkish reply wont ou to deny that the vizierial letters of 1262 (1846) and 1277 (1801) made any definite mention of the right to navigate the Tigris, and that in any ease they could not override the terms of the ahuve-men- tioned firmans. Mr. Wyndbam reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had unofficially stated that orders would be sent to the Vali of Bagdad to suspend the execution of his orders (prohibiting the run- nino' of the steamers) pending further instrue- tions. Mr. Wyndham handed to the Porte a memo randum regarding the company's rights. This document based their right to run \ essels on the Tigris and Euphrates on the agreement concluded in 1846 between Sir S. Canning and the Porte, ' which arrangement was notified by Imperial order in a vizicrial letter to the Pasha of Bagdad dated the 2nd April, 1816.' The note went on to assert that this vizierial letter recog nised the right of ' les b^timeuts anglais ' to ply on these rivers for the purposes of trade, and fixed the duties to be paid in the case of seagoing vessels, and vessels trading between different localities on those rivers, and that this letter was confirmed by two vizierial letters in 1861- 1862. Musurus Pasha announced that, pending further discussion, the Porte had decided to sus pend temporarily the measures taken against Lvnch's steamers. Mr. Lynch reported the receipt of a telegram from Bagdad to the effect that the restrictions had been removed on the 5th, but that the consul-general had advised their agent not to use the barges. This advice was confirmed by the Foreign Office, but the company replied on the 13th August requesting permission, in view of the accumulation of cargo, to instruct their agents to use three steamers and tow barges. The company were informed, however, that in tlie opinion of Her Majesty's Government the company should confine their operations to two steamers. A conversation took place between Musurus Pasha, Sir Julian Pauncefote, and Lord E. Fitzmaurice on the 15th August on the subject of the interpretation of the agreement of 1846. Musurus Pasha began the discussion by saying that the firman of 1834 applied to the 1883—(con^.) Mr. Wyndham, Telegraphic, August 1. Mr. Wyndham, No. 224, Commercial, July 25.

It was pointed out to him that the firman said nothing about Lynch and his company, but mentioned the British Government. He then spoke of the firman of 1841 as expressly naming Lynch and identifying him with the grant of 1834. The Turkish Ambassador proceeded to connect the vizierial letters of 1846 and 1861 with the firmans of 1834 and 1841, and to limit the grant made by the former by reference to the terms of the latter. The vizierial letter of 1861 spoke of Bagdad as being on the Euphrates, and Musurus Pasha said that it was signed by a man who knew nothing and could net sign his own name, and was merely confirmatory of the vizierial letter of 1846. As regards the latter vizierial letter, he argued that Sir S. Canning's despatch of the 25th March of that year was not a fair or accurate version of its terms, and maintained that the only privilege accorded was to British-owned barques' to navigate the Tigris and Euphrates for the purposes of internal trade upon payment of equal dues with ' barques ' of Ottoman subjects, and to British vessels generally to pay no more than the customary dues and an anchorage due upon entering or leaving any port of entry, Bussorah being thereby intended and not Bagdad as this latter was not a port of entry, Messrs. Lynch hoped that His Majesty's Government, in the discussion with the Porte, would insist on the unrestricted right of naviga tion of the Tigris by British vessels of all kinds, and also that the Porte should grant compensa tion for the attack on the ' Khalifah ' in 1880, for the interference with the barges of the com pany in February 1881, and for the losses suffered owing to the stoppage of the steamers on the 15th June. The company submitted a statement of their claims, amounting to 15,000/. . Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, August 17. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Oompany, October 15. To Lord Dufferin, No. 222, _ Commercial, December 13. Earl Granville informed Lord Dufferin that Musurus Pasha had stated, on the 5th August, that the Porte would in future only allow the company to navigate the Euphrates, and that he had added that, in the Porte's opinion, the letter of 1846 did not apply to British vessels navi gating under the British flag, but only to, vessels,1 built by Englisli owners, or belonging to tliem 1883 (cont.) and sailing under the Ottoman Mag. Musurus Pasha was informed of the mistake arising out of the mention oi Ijieutenant Jj\nch in the firman of August 18il, and, at the same time, he was asked to state the 1 urkish ease in To Musurus Pasha, December 13. writing. I M U . Hi This he proceeded to do in a note on the 28th December, in which he also denied having confused the Lieutenant Lynch of August 1841 with the company of the same name subsequently formed. The Turkish argument is briefly that the sole right of navigation possessed by the company is derived from the firmans of ]8'34 and 1841. (See Appendix XX.) Musurus Pasha also forwarded Turkish versions of the translations of the firmans dated 1834 and 1841. (See Appendix XX, Enclosures 1 and 2.) Early in the year it was stated in the House of Commons, in reference to a question relative to the grant to a Turkish merchant of Bagdad of a concession for the navigation of the Tigris, that Her Majesty's Government were desirous that the Tigris and Euphrates should be opened to naviga tion by vessels under all flags, but that the principle of free navigation of rivers established by the Additional Act of the Treaty »f Vienna applied only to those flowing through the terri tories of different States, In reply to a further question in the House of Commons, Lord E. Eitzmaurice stated that the right to navigate the Tigris was not granted by any firman, but had been exercised under an arrangement obtained by Sir Stratford Canning in 184fi, and confirmed by vizierial letters addressed to the Yali of Bagdad in 184C, 1861, and 1862. In March the Turkish Ambassador enquired as to the reason for the appearance at Bussorah of Her Majesty's ship &lt;f Eclipse,' and was informed that although, in deference to the wishes of the Porte, British ships of war did not proceed farther up the river than Kurna, Her Majesty's Government were not aware of any regulation precluding such ships from visiting Bussorah.

It was also mentioned that the old ' Comet' would be broken up at Bagdad before the arrival of the new one. 1884. —Lord Dufferin reported that he had informed the Minister for foreign Affairs of the intended replacement of the old ' Comet,' and that the Vali of; Bagdad had been instructed accordingly, though he anticipated objections on the latter's part.

Whether (assuming that agreement to be abandoned) the vizierial letter of January 1861, and the fact of the enjoyment by the company of the privilege for twenty-two years without pro test, are evidence of an agreement by the Porte to the establishment of the two steamers of the company on these rivers, and if so whether in the circumstances Her Majesty's Government are entitled to insist on the maintenance of the sta(us quo. (See Appendix XXI.) A draft reply to the Turkish Ambassador was also forwarded for the approval of the Law Officers. India Office, November io. To Lord Dufferin, No. 395, November 15. 1884. Lord Dufferin, No. 34, January 30,1884.r; i ' 48 It was rumoured that the Porte intended to establish a Turkish company at Bagdad, and buy out the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. The Law Officers were asked whether any communication should be made to the Porte on account of this rumour, and they were also asked for an opinion regarding Messrs. Lynch's claim for damages (Appendix XXII). The Law Officers replied on tiie I9th April agreeing to the lines of the proposed reply to the Porte, and stated that in view of the fuller information, they thought that the position of the British Government was somewhat stronger than they had thought it in 1881, but that the difficulties arising from the action of the em bassy subsequent to 1846 still remained. They suggested postponing any action for enforcing the claim of the company for damages. (See Appendix XXIII.) Lord Dufferin reported that Assim had begged for a little delay during which to overcome the objections of the Pasha of Bagdad. A note was addressed to Musurus Pasha setting forth in detail the British claim, and denying that the rights of the company rested on the firmans of 1834 and 1841, and asserting on the contrary that they were derived from the agreement of 1840, and the confirmatory vizierial letter of 1861. (See Appendix XXV.) During tlu* course of a debate in the House of Commons on the 8th August of this year the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign AfTairs, in reference to the company's rights, said:— Even if it were conceded that the contracting parties were not ad idem in respect of the agree ments of 1846 and 1861, and that there was no intention on the part of the Porte to grant to British shipping in general the right of navi gating the rivers, Her Majesty's Government contended that the vizierial letter of 1861, having been issued for the very purpose of enabling the company to put their two steamers on the Tigris and Euphrates, was intended to confer, and did confer, that privilege upon them Her Majesty's Government were not necessarily called upon to invoke the general right of navigation claimed by them on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates.

Owing to the inadequacy of the accommo dation at the customs wharf at Bagdad, and the consequent delay in loading and unloading the company's steamers, it was decided to moor a barge at Bagdad into which the steamers could discharge. Mr. Wyndham requested the Porte's permission, which was, however, re fused, on the ground that compliance with this new request would be dangerous, in view of the continual demands made by the Erench and Dutch to have also the privilege of navigating the Tigris, and the barge was stopped at Kurna on the way up. 1885. —Whilst recognising the inadvisability of reopening the question of the navigation of the Tigris, instructions were given by the Foreign Office to the charge d'affaires at Constantinople to make representations respecting the obstacles placed by the Bagdad authorities in the way of loading and unloading the steamers of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany by means of barges or otherwise. In can- sequence he addressed a note verbale to the Porte relative to the inadequacy of the wharf accom modation at Bagdad, and the difficulties thrown in the way of the company's legitimate traffic. In reference to the detention of the company's barge, Mr. Wyndham stated in this note that as far as he knew there was no regulation prohibit ing the towing of an empty barge by hand to Bagdad. According to the chronological precis of corre spondence on the subject enclosed in Sir P. Currie's despatch No. 408, of the 21st June, 1887, the embassy at Constantinople received from the Porte a note verbale dated the 21th September, 1885, which ran, ' The Vali of Bagdad states that the wharf accommodation at Bagdad is ample. Messrs. Lynch are authorised by Imperial Pirman only to have two steamers on the Euphrates; the Sublime Porte cannot allow them to keep on the Tigris a barge which could easily, be converted into a steamer. Still less can they allow foreigners to build a bonded [163] 0. , , v.. , ; : • ■ v- • » '.V ' 50 wharf on an internal river of the Empire for their own use. The Imperial Crovernment is tlie less inclined to act, as Messrs. Lynch seem unfortunately disposed to abuse the facilities granted to them. Fhus, though Ihe express condition of their firman allows them to keep two vessels on the Euphrates, they have ex tended their service to the Tigris, constantly seek to increase their fleet, and actually style them selves unduly ' Tigris and Euphrates Navigation Company,* a title which even Her Majesty's Embassy gives them. The Sublime Porte there fore begs Her Majesty's Embassy to request Messrs, Lynch to abstain from infringing the conditions of their privilege, and thus adding to to the already numerous difficulties of the question.' This communication was referred for observations to the consul-general at Bagdad, who replied that it would be inopportune to do anything which might result in reopening the Tigris navigation question, and the matter was, therefore, allowed to drop. The Porte complained that the new ' Comet' had proceeded to Samarra, and that this was un fait etant sans precedent et depassant I'autorisation accord^e.' Musurus Pasha was told in reply that the consul at Bagdad had proceeded to Samarra in the ' Comet' for the sole purpose of visiting his consular district, and had no reason to anticipate any objection being raised to his adopting this course as the safest and most convenient mode of discharging his consular dutv of inspection. Her Majesty's Government said that in future, however, due notice of any such intention would be given to the local authorities. In July the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company informed the consul-general at Bagdad that they had made an arrangement with the local authorities to convey Ottoman mails to KM, Amarah and Bussorah, and vice versd, and that the opposition to the loading and unloading of their steamers at Bagdad had been removed. 1886. —On the 18th March the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company asked that action might be taken to obtain the release of their £ third steamer and of four barges then lying at Bussorah,' and were informed that Her Majesty's Government were of the opinion that it was undesirable to reopen the question of the 1885— (cont.)

In the latter part of this year it was reported that a new canal (Dujailah Canal) was being cut on the Tigris between Bagdad and Bussorah. As it was anticipated that the canal, by drawing off the waters of the Tigris, might prove detrimental to the navigation of the river, rrpresentations were made to the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs, who promised to submit the matter to the serious consideration of his Government.

The vali had replied that he could not agree to the use of the third steamer, but consented to the barges being towed as a temporary concession, which would expire on the 12th May, 1887. The Vali of Bussorah refused, however, to agree to this. The matter was referred to the Porte, who instructed the Vali of Bussorah not to obstruct the com pany any further. Acting Consul- The ' Khalifah,' with a barge in tow, arrived at Bagdad on the 23rd January. Consul-General Colonel Tweedie reported that the vali had (ikgdad) informed him the Porte considered the famine No. 7, Commercial, at an end, and that in consequence the per mission for the towing of the barges must cease. Colonel Tweedie thought that, as the permission had only been temporary, he could not object. 1888. —Fresh representations relative to the Dujailah Canal were made to the Porte in April and it was ascertained that measures were being taken to fill it up. 1889. —There appears to have been no corre spondence in this year. 1890. —The Belgian ' Bulletin du Mus^e commercial' for the 19th April contained a notice of the proposed improvement of the Euphrates to render navigation possible at all seasons.

Upon Euphrates and . / , .i . i ' Turris Steam enquiry, it was ascertained that the company Navigation were anxious to have their rights of navigation ^ Mr. ti. I j BW ^ on the Tigris and Euphrates specially confirmed October 15, in the new treaty, and to obtain permission to p 1 ^65] 78, run a third steamer and to tow barges, Mr. (afterwards Sir E.) Law, British delegate, Mr. E. Law, suggested that, as the company's privileges of [conMedial 6078, navigation were originally granted to the British ^ 0 - 151 &gt; P- i® 5 -] Government, confirmation should be in respect of British ships generally, no mention being made of the Company. Sir W. White was To Sir W. White, instructed to act upon this suggestion. cLmercial, October 29, [Confidential 6078, No. 166, p. 174.] I Sir W, White reported in November that the Sir W. White, Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com- Commercial, pany had requested Colonel Tweedie to obtain November 5,1890. permission for their third steamer, the 44 Blosse Lynch ' (then employed on the Karun River), to run on the Tigris, while their other two (the Mejidieh and the ' Khalifah ') were being repaired. Colonel Tweedie anticipated no diffi culty in arranging this locally. 1801. Mr. (afterwards Sir George) Mackenzie 1891. submitted the draft of a concession ' for the Mr. Mackenzie, exclusive right of working river steamers and Februar y 2 ' 1891 - barges on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates to any navigable point, as well as upon the Shatt- el-Arab,' which he stated had been approved1891— {cont.) privately at Constantinople. A Turkish company was to be formed ; the, ships were to fly the Ottoman liag*, and he manned by Turks, though officered, by Englishmen. » o Sir W. White said this was in accordance with what he believed to be the designs of the Minister of Marine to form a Turkish company, whose ships would drive those of Messrs. Lynch off the rivers. The British delegates (for the negotiation of Sir W. White, No. 74, February 27. Sir W. White, No. 21, Commercial, February 20. (Confidential Print, 6158, No. 32, p. 18.) Sir W.

White, No. 42, Commercial, March 28, (Confidential Print, 6158, No. 42, p. 32). the new Anglo-Turkish commercial treaty) reported that on the 17th February they had raised the question of the privileges enjoyed by Messrs. Lynch. They stated that the first objection raised by the Ottoman delegates was the mention in any way of the Government in connection with the exceptional privileges, as they considered such mention might, under the most-favoured-nation clause, lead to undesirable complications with other Powers, but they were prepared to discuss the question as regards the private company. SirW. White transmitted acopyof &amp; pro-memo rid (see Appendix XXVI), signed ad referendum by the delegates for the commercial treaty (then being negotiated with Turkey), the object of which was to secure to Messrs. Lynch their existing rights of navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates. Sir W. White pointed out that this would be superfluous if Messrs. Lynch intended to merge their rights with those of an Ottoman navigation company, a course which, from Mr. Mackenzie's letter, he assumed they intended to adopt. Messrs. Lynch were informed, but denied any intention on their part of ceding their rights to an Ottoman company. The British delegates, when reporting the signature ad referendum, of the pro-memorid con firming the rights of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, summarised the negotiations as follows :— 'All these points having been settled, the British delegates declared that they could not sign the article without receiving some docu ment explicitly confirming the rights under which the steamers of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company now ply between Bussorah and Bagdad. ' The Ottoman delegates resisted the idea of the necessity of any such declaration, and still more the necessity of defining the existing privi- [163] P54 le^es. The British delegates, however, main- 1891— tained that until this question was definitely and satisfactorily settled they could not proceed any further. Finally, a pro-memorid was drafted which clearly defined the existing privileges as including such conditions as were specified in IVlr. Dawes's letter of the 15th October, 1890 (No. 152 in the Confidential 6078, p. 105), as necessary for the satisfaction of the company. 44 In drafting this pro-memorid the Ottoman delegates pressed very strongly tor the adoption of such wording as would have limited the enjoyment of all privileges to Mr. Lynch per sonally. This caused much further discussion, as the British delegates would not admit that the rights in question had been conferred on Mr. Lynch personally. They maintained the theory that the rights were general for a bi-weekly service, and that the service w r as at present maintained by Lynch's company. The Ottoman delegates at length agreed to recognise the rights as general for a service of steamers, provided it w r as specified by whom that service was now perfortncd, such distinct specification being in their opinion necessary to prevent the possible claiming of similar privileges by other Powers under the most-favoured-nation clause. 'The British delegates having accepted this manner of drafting the pro-memorid, article 16 and the pro-memorid in question were finally signed ad referendum and exchanged.' Article 16 (the 'cabotage' article) granted freedom of navigation to river ports not more than 15 kilom. from the sea—the following words being used (paragraph 4):— 44 Quant h la navigation des lacs et fleuves, elle est 6galement r6serv^e au pavilion ottoman. Par exception, le port de la ville de Bassorah sera, comme par le pass^, toujours ouvert a la naviga tion anglaise. En outre, les ports et villes qui se trouvent a une distance n'exc&amp;lant pas 15 kilom. de la mer seront consid^r^s comme ports de mer ouverts a la navigation anglaise.' Article 10 became article 18 in the draft treaty put forward in 1901. During the course of the year a question arose gi r w w as to the employment of the ' Comet' to patrol No - ^ the Bussorah w 7 aters and the Shatt-el-Arab as far ^ as Fao during the date season, in order to prevent55 1891— {cont,) India Office, September 25.

Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, August 9, 1892. the levying of blackmail under the pretence of quarantine on British-Indian craft. The Otto man Grand Vizier objected to such use of the ' Comet' as being in excess of the limits laid down by the Porte when giving permission for a British gun-boat to be stationed at Bagdad. With the approval of the India Office, instruc tions were given to the Ambassador at Constan tinople to inform the Grand Vizier 'that, in the opinion of Her Majesty's Government, the terms of the firman of the 29th December, 1834, did not restrict the navigation of the two steamers mentioned therein to Bagdad and its immediate neighbourhood, but sanctioned their navigating the Euphrates, and that the employment of the ' Comet' in the manner proposed could not be regarded as constituting a departure from the provisions of the firman.' 1S92. — The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company stated that they believed a Turkish company was being formed at Bagdad whose shares were to be exclusively held by natives, and they apprehended that, in view of the restrictions their two steamers were subject to, they would not be able to compete successfully with the boats of the new company. They there fore asked that Sir C. Ford (Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople) should be in structed to urge the Porte to remove the restric tions. Sir C. Eord transmitted a memorandum by Mr. Dragoman Block dealing with the formation of the new Turkish company. Mr. Block stated that the scheme had been under consideration by the ' Civil List' for some time, and that the Sultan would hold a large number of shares. Mr. Block thought that for this reason the company would be made a paying concern. The company wrote specifying the restrictions which they wished removed. They were :— 1. Restriction to use of two steamers only. 2. Prohibition of navigation of the Euphrates and of the Tigris above Bagdad. 3. Prohibition of towing of barges. The company also desired to use a small steamer (' bateau mouche '). If these restric tions were removed the company thought they would be able to carry on the service. f0t&gt;s y./ u. 56 Sir C. Ford was furnished with a Foreign OiTice library memorandum, dated the 3rd October, on the rights of the company and of British subjects generally to navigate the Tigris and Euphrates, and was instructed to point out to the Porte the hardship inflicted on the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company by the restrictions, and to urge that the company should be put on a footing of equality with their rivals. Mr. Mackenzie stated that he was trying to get a controlling interest in the new Turkish company. Sir C. Ford transmitted a further memorandum by the dragomanate respecting the new Turkish company ; and stated that unless he was instructed to bring very strong pressure to bear he did not think that the Porte would extend Messrs. Lynch's privileges to the detriment of a native company whose shares were held by the Sultan himself, lie added that the firmans already granted did not guarantee to Messrs. Lynch facilities equal to those accorded to natives. The memorandum pointed out the changed attitude of the Porte towards foreign commercial enterprises as compared with its attitude in lb34, and insisted that the moment was not opportune to ask for more privileges than those contained in the pro-mem or id annexed to the commercial treaty. (See Appendix XXVI.) As a result of a memorandum, dated the 17th November, written by Mr. (afterwards Sir F.) Bertie, Sir C. Ford was instructed that, on the issue of the irade sanctioning the new Turkish company, he should insist on two British merchant-vessels being allowed to continue navigating the Tigris and Euphrates without limit as to the extent of the navigation or the date of the voyages, and without being subjected to the payment of higher dues than those mentioned in the vizierial letters of 1846 and 1861. lie was also instructed to insist on the right of the two British steamers to tow barges or other craft not under British colours, and was told that, in order to secure the objects mentioned, it would be necessary to amend the pro-memond by striking out the specific mention of Messrs. Lynch, the limitation of the naviga tion to between Bussorah and Bagdad, and the restriction of the sprvif»o &lt;&lt; hebdomadaire. ^ ^ ^ bi - 0.

He added that Mr. Block thouglit tlie moment inopportune for raising the other questions, and that any attempt to amend the declaration might be regarded by the Porte as an excuse for tearing the whole document up. The company were informed that it was not proposed to move further in the matter. To Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, February 9, 1893. 1894. Sir P. Currie, No. 245, May 18,1894. Enclosure in Sir P. Currie, No. 275, June 1. Turkish Ambassador, May 22. 1894. —Sir P. Currie reported that Said Pasha (Turkish Minister for Eoreign Affairs) had remon strated against a journey up the Tigris which the consul-general at Bagdad (Colonel Mockler) had made in the ' Comet.' He added that Colonel Mockler informed him he had made the journey to Samarra in consequence of disturbances at that place, and that he had informed the Vali of Bagdad of his intention to do so. Sir P. Currie communicated this information to the Porte. In a report on his journey Colonel Mockler mentioned that one of his objects in making the river trip was that of ' preserving unquestioned right of the ' Comet' (and of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's two steamers also) to navigate the Tigris up to such point as might at any time be found practicable and desirable.' The Turkish Ambassador protested against the the voyage of the ' Comet,' and stated that— e&lt; Le Gouvernement Imperial consid^re que ce voyage effectue sans autorisation prealable, dans les eaux interieures de I'Empire, a bord d'un b^timent de sruerre constitue une serieuse irres^u- larite.' To Rustem Pasha, June 16. Rustem Pasha, October 4. The Turkish Ambassador was reminded of Lord Salisbury's note to Musurus Pasha of the 11th July, 1S85 (see ante, p. 50), and it was pointed out that, as it had been accepted without demur. Her Majesty's Government had assumed no objection had been taken to its contents. In the circumstances the hope was expressed that the Porte would not object to the consul-general occasionally using the stationnaire for the purpose of visiting parts of his consular district on the Tigris above Bagdad, and the note added, ' the Porte may be assured that in any such cases the consent of the Turkish authorities w r ill be first obtained. 7 ' In reply Uustem Pasha stated that the Porte based the refusal to grant permission for the [163] Q- ■ ■ — : I 58 consul-general to make journeys m above Bagdad on the ground that such per mission would he regarded as a precedent by the other foreign consuls, who might claim similar privileges for the vessels of their respective countries. Although Rustem Pasha admitted that no Sir r Sandersoa such claim had been made by any other Power, (India Office),] his communication was regarded as an indication 0( t&lt;,ber 12 ' that permission would not in tuture be gi\cn by the Turkish authorities ; but it was not considered necessary to issue instructions for the discon tinuance of the practice. During this year the question arose of the To Sir P. Ourne, renewal, at a reduced subsidy, ot the Euphrates j u iy 12. and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's contract for the conveyance of mails between Hussorah and Bagdad, and Sir P. Currie was informed that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company had stated that, in view of the reduced subsidy which the Government of India were prepared to pay, they might be com pelled to give up their service unless they could obtain permission to run a third steamer, the Blosse Lynch ' (then in reserve at Bussorah), or alternatively to tow barges behind their two authorised steamers. Sir P. Currie was asked whether he thought he could obtain either of these concessions from the Porte. Sir P. Currie replied that, as the Porte had not Sir P. Currie, . No 353 even signed the pro-memorid annexed to article 16 } ul y 27' of the commercial treaty, it would be fruitless to endeavour to obtain any other concessions, and the company were informed. In the course of the year a question arose respecting import duty charged at Bussorah on the ' Malamir,' a vessel belonging to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany. The company stated on the 8th March that vessels of all nations were allowed to ply between the sea and Bussorah without payment of any duty whatever, and the consul at Bussorah was instructed to report whether the Shatt-el- Arab between Bussorah and Kurna was treated by the Ottoman authorities as a free river so far as the payment of duties was concerned, and in reply he made the following statement: 'The Consul BevUle river between Bussorah and Gurna (Kurna) is as ( ^ o U8 s orah )' regards the levy of custom duty considered a free Commercial, river, the Turkish authorities now prohibiting ocean steamers from going higher up the river the ' Comet' 1894— (con/.)59 1894— {cont.)

Exception was taken to the first part of this statement hy the consul-general at Bagdad, his argument being that as ' goods on which duty had not been paid at Bussorah could not be carried past it to Kurna by the vessels which brought them ' to the former place, therefore the Shatt-el-Arab between Bussorah and Kurna was not a free river as regards levy of customs duty. 2895. —The company asked that, in view of the exceptionally low state of the Tigris, Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople might be requested to obtain permission from the Porte for the temporary use of barges. Sir P. Currie was instructed to endeavour to obtain the temporary permission desired. The charge d'affaires reported that the Grand Vizier had promised to send telegraphic instruc tions to permit the temporary use of barges. The company stated that they were availing themselves of the permission. 2896. —The company reported that, according to their agent at Bagdad, a German called Herr Pelix Moral was endeavouring to obtain a concession for placing steamers on the Tigris in connection with a proposed road between Bagdad and Tehran. The company hoped that Her Majesty's Government would take steps to protect their steamers against any attempt on the part of the Turkish Government to grant special facilities to foreign enterprises without removing the restrictions which were still maintained on the operations of the British line. Sir P. Currie was instructed to bear the point in mind, if he heard of any application on the part of Herr Moral. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company learned that the Messageries Mari- times intended to introduce a direct service to Bussorah, and to apply for permission to run steamers on the Tigris in connection therewith. The company reported that the local authorities at Bussorah had ordered their agents to cease towing barges as the river was no longer low. The company suggested that it would be a good tor60 opportunitv to approach tlie Porte with a view to 1896— (cont,) obtaining permanent permission to tow barges. Mr. Streatfeild reviewed the position of the Foreign Office , r „. ^^ memorandum, Euphrates and iigns Steam Navigation Com- February 25. pany's claim, and came to the conclusion that, as the treaty of commerce of 1891 with Turkey had not been concluded, the company had not acquired the privileges granted by the pro- memorid, and that, in view of Messrs. Block and Wrench's opinions in 1893, it was not likely that any good would result by reopening the question. Sir P. Currie was, however, asked for his To Sir P. Currie, • • No. 54, March 3. opinion on the question. Sir P. Currie stated the report as to the ^ ir ^• Currie, . . ,. * XI A1 • -vr '4.- No. 223, March 18. intentions ot the Messagenes Mantimes was unfounded, and added that as long as the present Minister of Marine was in office any such project would be strongly opposed. Sir P. Currie pointed out that, as the permission Sir P. Currie, to tow barges was only temporary, no objection N&lt;) - 239 ' March 26 - could be taken to its revocation. He suggested the company should apply for a renewal at the next low season of the Tigris. He added that he did not think it advisable to apply for perma nent permission. The company were informed. To Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, April 9. The Euphrates and ligris Steam Navigation Euphrates and Company stated that cargo was again accumu- lating at Bussorah owing to the low state of Company, the river, and asked that the Porte should be ^ eptemoer 15 - requested to renew the temporary permission to tow barges. Sir P. Currie was instructed accordinorly To Sir P. Currie, No. 192, Telegraphic, ~ r September 18. fc^ir P. Currie reported that he had failed to Sir P.

The company stated that they had had to suspend Euphrates and shipments of cargo to Bussorah, and suggested Na^ftST that permission to tow barges should be sought Company, for a limited period of two months. Sir P. i)ecem ^ er ^ Currie was instructed on the 5th December to urge the Porte to grant this request. Sir P. Currie stated, however, that the Grand Sir P. Currie* Vizier had informed him that, in view of the ?eietr!nhi c objections of the Minister of Marine, the Porte DecemW 24 could not grant the desired permission.9^^ ^3 1897. Sir P. Currie, No. 57, January 26, 1897 Enclosure in London Chamber of Commerce March 13= 1897. —A letter from the London Chamber of Commerce calling attention to the hampered condition under which conveyance of merchandise was conducted on the Tigris, and suggesting remedies, was communicated to Sir P. Currie. who, in reply, pointed out the misconception as to the attitude of the Turkish Government under which British merchants laboured, and showed that the Porte had no desire to see the trade of Turkey developed. He thought the only practical course for the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company would he to have an agent at Constantinople, who wculd interest the officials concerned in the matter. Sir P. Currie added that he had sent in a note to the Porte embodying the suggestions of the London Chamber of Commerce, and giving arguments in favour of extending the company's privileges, in which, however, the following passage occurs :— A third steamer which is in reserve cannot be utilised, as under the terms of the Imperial firman only two English steamers are permitted to ply on the river' The note went on to suggest that the Ottoman Government should run the third steamer, placing her temporarily, if so required, under the Turkish flag, a reasonable commission on the steamer's earnings being retained as remuneration. Mr. Buchanan, acting as special agent at Constantinople of the London Chamber of Com merce, reported that he had talked the matter over with M. Theodoridi, Sir P. Currie, and Mr. Block, who were of opinion that Hassan Pasha, the Minister of Marine, could not be moved in any way, and Mr. Buchanan con sidered that the simplest course wxmld be for the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to try and obtain a controlling interest in the existing Turkish company. Mr. Buchanan added that he w^as informed that the Erench had tried but failed to obtain a concession for steamers on the Tigris. A report showing the causes of the serious decrease in the volume of water in the Tigris below Amarah, w^hich, if continued, ^ould render navigation impracticable between Kalat Salah and Ezra's Tomb, was communicated to the Eoreign Office by the company, and the [163] 11 ill i ! &lt;! ■■ ■ ■■ ■■hwm ihwimmww™ 62 Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed to call the Porte's attention to the facts stated therein. He did so, and about two months later a communication was received from the Porte to the effect that the necessary works for the improvement of the navigable channel of the river would be commenced as soon as the waters reached the proper level. In May of this year the company stated that their Bagdad agents reported that Colonel Loch, the political agent at Bagdad, had requested them to return to Bussorah the stationary barge which they had used for two years at Bagdad for the discharge of cargo from their steamers. From the considerable correspondence which ensued, it appears that when permission to the company to tow barges, granted in November 1895, ceased in 1896, a barge was retained at Bagdad for the purpose of discharging cargo whenever it was found necessary for the com pany to do so owing to the insufficient wharfage accommodation. The Turkish authorities ob jected in October 1896, and Colonel Mockler exhausted all efforts to keep the barge, and Colonel Loch did the same shortly after taking charge, but without avail. Colonel Loch there fore requested the company's agent to send the barge back to Bussorah, in the company's own interests, lest the Porte might, on the ground of breach of privilege, refuse a future application for the renewal of the permission to tow barges. The letter from the company of the 14th May was the result. The company were informed that Her Ma jesty's Government thought that the Porte were clearly within their rights in demanding the withdrawal of the bar^e. o * Sir P. Currie reported that he had addressed a note to the Porte consenting to the withdrawal of the barge subject to the receipt of assurances that they would grant the company permission to tow barges when the river was low, and would issue instructions expediting the loading and discharging of ships at Bagdad. The company asked that permission should he obtained for them to tow barges during the Or*mi-nr» 1897— {cont.) To Sir P. Currie, No. 84, March 18. Sir P. Currie, No. 361, May 26.

Currie added that he had made renewed representations privately and through Mr. Block, the dragoman. 1898. —In a note dated the 7th Eebruary the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs intimated that works were soon to be commenced for the improvement of navigation of the Tigris, but declined to permit the towing of barges even temporarily, and, in a later note, refused to submit the question again to the Sultan. As a result of a series of letters from the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, pointing out how the Tigris was silting up, and the consequent loss they were suffering, renewed representations were made to the Porte, but Mr. Block reported that Tewfik Pasha informed him that it was useless to try and get the Sultan to reconsider hifc decision as long as he continued to harbour suspicions of Her Majesty's Government's designs in the Persian Gulf. Major Melville (acting consul-general at Bagdad) reported that he had discussed the question of applying to the Vali of Bagdad for temporary permission to tow barges with Messrs. Lynch's local agent, and that they had come to the conclusion that an application would do more harm than good, as it would enable the Turks to reopen the question of the barge stationed at Bagdad (see ante, p. 62), and insist on its removal. SirN. O'Conor concurred in this Sir N. O'Conor, No. 665, December 21. Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, December 31. Sir N. O'Conor, No. 618, November 23. 1899. Sir N.

The company repeated their contention that the question of the barge at Bagdad had nothing to do with that of the right to tow barges, and added that the barge would be withdrawn when the custom-house was enlarged. During the year a sum of 30,000 piastres was allotted by the Turkish Government for the improvement of the Tigris, and an engineer was employed to build dams and canals at certain points on the river. Not only, however, was the sum allowed insufficient for the purpose, but the Arabs in the locality attacked the engineer and destroyed the work done by him. 1899.- —SirN.

O C onor 1899 {cont.) added that he had not thought it desirable to enter into the question as to whether this permission applied only to the towing of two barges during low water or whether it was of a more general application. The company were informed on the 15th June. Mr. Lynch called and said that if the permis sion was only for the low season it should be recorded formally in writing, and should extend from the 1st July to the 81st January. If, however, the permission was general he thought it need not be in writing. Sir 2s. O'Conor was informed, and replied that Sir N. O'Conor to Sir T. Sanderson, it was not to Messrs. Lyncn s advantage to nx j ull e 19. the dates of plying, and that, if they did not irritate the local authorities by too much energy, they would probably be allowed to run barges during most of the year. The company pointed out that from a Euphrates and commercial point of view the uncertainty was NavigMion' 1 undesirable, ns their arrangements for shipping cargo had to be made months beforehand. Sir N.

(See Appendix XXIX.)] Sir N. O'Conor to Sir T. Sanderson, December 19. 1900. 1901. Sir N. O'Conor, No. 65, Commercial, July 25, 1901. Sir N. O'Conor reported that the Grand Vizier had informed him that the Sultan refused to issue the desired irade. Tewfik had, however, suggested the acceptance of a compromise limiting the privilege to three years. Sir N. O'Conor thought Her Majesty's Government ought to insist on the fulfilment of the vizierial promise of June, even though the immediate result might not be so satisfactory to the com pany, but he asked for the company's views. The company were totally opposed to any com promise, and Sir N. O'Conor was informed by telegraph on the 20th September. Sir N. O'Conor informed the Porte that he would insist on the fulfilment of its promise,- whereupon the Sultan issued an irade to allow the company to tow barges till the existing accumulation of cargo had been cleared ofi, but Sir N. O'Conor refused to accept this as a solution. Meantime, however, the Vali of Bus sorah had been instructed to allow the company to tow barges as a temporary measure, and, Sir N. O'Conor thought matters should be left thus, for he would still be in a position to protest and insist on the continuance of the privilege if and when it was really sought to ter minate it. Sir N. O'Conor thought that enough had been done by Her Majesty's Government for Messrs. Lynch, and said that, according to the consul at Bussorah, the empressement about the barges was fictitious,' for it appeared from admissions made by Lynch's agent that there was not such a large amount of cargo as was made out by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company in London. 2900.—No correspondence seems to have taken place in this year. 2901. —In connection with the negotiations for a new commercial treaty with Turkey, Sir N. O'Conor submitted a revised draft of the pro- memorid of 1891 (see Appendix XXVI), which [163] Sf |jj(| 'jj ['p'! f I,. h9; at aa III ii : 66 Messrs. Lynch considered represented with more accuracy the extent of the rights of navigation which they enjoyed on the Kiver Tigris. This draft was approved, and inserted as paragraph 3 in the draft final protocol. (Appendix XXX.) When the draft treaty of commerce was returned to Sir N. O'Conor for submission to the Turkish delegates, he was instructed to endeavour to induce the Porte to agree to the permanent removal of restrictions as to the size and number of British vessels allowed to navigate the Tigris above Bussorah. The company asked that, in view of the bad state of the river and the accumulation of cargo, permission might be sought from the Forte for them to run their reserve steamer ' Blosse Lynch ' for three months, and they stated subsequently that they were willing to run the vessel if necessary under the Turkish flag; but Sir N. O'Conor did not think the moment opportune for making such a request. Sir N. O'Conor reported that he had asked the Grand Vizier whether there was any truth in a rumour that the Minister of Marine had petitioned for the withdrawal of the company's concession on the ground of the losses caused by competition to the Turkish company, and that Tewfik had denied that there was any such intention. 1902. —Sir N. O'Conor gave at length his reasons for not putting forward the company's latest request. (See Appendix XXXI.) Sir N. O'Conor reported that the Turkish Oman Company* had purchased two modern light-draught river steamers and six barges. Sir N. O'Conor transmitted a note from the Porte (dated the 10th March), asking that the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany should be instructed to discontinue towing barges, on the ground that the privilege to do so was only granted in the year 1889,* &lt;4 pro- visoirement, et pour une seule fois uniquement.' Sir N. O Conor thought that until the com mercial treaty had been signed it would be impossible to point to any document in which the privilege was recognised. Sir N. O'Conor reported that TewEk Pasha had informed him that the real reason for the Porte's note of the 10th March was that the Russian 1901— (cont.) To Sir N. O'Conor No. 78, Commercial, August 13.

Embassy had demanded for a Bussian company the same privileges as had been granted to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany. Tewfik said that he had replied that Lynch's privileges were of ancient date, and sanctioned by especial firman, that the Porte had the right to reserve to itself the inland navigation of its rivers, and that it could not assent to the &lt;k droit de cabotage' being considered as conferring that right on foreign countries. Tewfik went on to explain the distinc- * [Note .—But in this connection see tion* he considered must be drawn betw 7 een Lynch's ancient right of navigation, based on the firman of 1834, and the more modern practice of towing barges dating from 1879. The company pointed out that the privilege of towing barges should by now be considered as a compensation by the Porte for the loss caused to the company owing to the river having been allowed to get into such a bad state, and they added that the liver was so low that the use of barges was necessary all the year round. Sir N. O'Conor stated that the Russian Ambassador at Constantinople had again raised the question of the navigation of the Tigris by Russian steamers, and further he anticipated that the German Government would also demand a concession to navigate the Tigris in connection with the construction of the Bagdad Railway. To Sir N. O 'Conor, i n this connection Sir N. O'Coaor was informed Mo. 173, May 21. TT . ^ ti i ^ • i that His Majesty s Government did not think they were entitled to claim a monopoly of navigation for the British company, but were of opinion that the question whether an additional line of steamers should be permitted to navigate the Tigris w 7 as one for the decision of the Ottoman Government who possessed the right of declining to grant a further concession for the navigation of the river. The company asserted that their rights had been in the nature of ' exclusive rights so far as nations foreign to Turkey are concerned,' and, while preferring that existing conditions should continue, they said that if a concession were granted to a foreign firm, His Majesty's Govern ment ought to press for the navigation of the rivers to be throwm open to the flags of all To Sir N. O'Conor, nations without restrictions. Sir N. O'Conor was No. 188, June 10. • ns ^ ruc ^ e( j j n this sense, and told to use this as an argument to urge the Porte not to grant the concession desired by the Russian Government.

Sir N. O'Conor referred to the proposed establishment of transit warehouses at Bussorah, in which all goods destined for Bagdad would be stored pending reshipment, and remarked that the project would unquestionably afford opportunities for the local authorities to hamper the company's trade and to favour the operations of the lurkish Company. He also commented on the threatened competition of the new vessels of the 'Oman' Company, but adhered to the opinion that it was not advisable in the interests of Lynch's Company to approach the Porte again in regard to the use of a third steamer. In his despatch were enclosed copies of corre spondence between Major Newmarch, Acting Consul-General at Bagdad, and the Postmaster- General at Bombay, respecting the renewal of the company's mail contract and the unsatisfactory service of mails between Bussorah and Bagdad, in the course of which the former observed that in view of the high freight rates charged by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company he looked forward with unqualified satisfaction to the severe competition of the new Turkish steamers.

Sir N. O'Conor, ^ O'Conor was of opinion, however, that March 21. the question should be excluded from the scope of the Customs increase negotiations. In regard to the employment of a third steamer, he feared that further representation might lead the Porte to question the privilege granted to the com- . pany to use two steamers, and he mentioned that the local authorities had urged the Central Government to cause the British steamers to be withdrawn. At the same time he enclosed a despatch from the consul-general at Bagdad, reporting that the company had attempted to run three steamers, by repeatedly and rapidly replacing one by another, so that, although only two were in actual use at any one time, all three were really employed in carrying. Objec tion to this proceeding had been made by the local Turkish authorities. Mr. Leveson Q n the 18th April Mr. G.

The [163] T■OBBDDBBB ' ^ 70 claim was further set forth in a memorandum 1905 (cont.) submitted by Mr. Lynch on the 6th May. Mr jj F B Mr. Lynch quoted articles 1, 23, and 27 of the Lynch, . p May 6. Capitulations of 1809, and article 1 ol the treaty of 1838, in confirmation of ancient British rights of navigation on the Euphrates and Tigris, and contended that the firman of 183 i, issued in response to a request confined to the two steamers, which it was then proposed to place on the rivers for commercial purposes, did not invalidate the British right of navigation already enjoyed on both rivers, lie asserted that the British Government had never admitted that the company was limited to the use of two steamers, and urged that, as the Turkish company had increased the number of their steamers, the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company should be allowed, on grounds of equity and of general rights of navigation, to use their third steamer. Mr. Lynch's contentions were referred to Sir N. O'Conor, who replied to them cate- Sir N. O'Conor, gorically. He pointed out that the general Ma y 16 ' question of the right of British vessels to navigate the ligris and Euphrates had never been raised, and that to invoke the Capitulations of 1809 and the Balta-Liman Treaty of 1838, in support of such right, would not be in the interests of the company, for the shipping of other Powers would, under most-favoured-nation treatment, equally benefit by anything obtained for British shipping. He observed that tlie vizierial letter of 1861 clearly stated that, under the firmans of 183i ami ]842 (1841), authorisation had been given for the permanent station of two steamers, ct providing it were proved and established that the advantages would be mutual, and that no . inconvenience would arise therefrom,' and the assertion that the British Government had never admitted the limitation of the company's rights o ^e use of two steamers was incorrect. He further remarked that no monopoly of transport t! t e rr nted t0 the com P an y&gt; and that the Tnrk.sh Government possessed an undoubted right to place as many steamers and barges on gns as they chose, and that there was a tEt UPOn , WhiCl1 a deraa,ld f0r the us « ^ Sir N (to' com P a ny could be made.

Mr. Barclay to Mr. Maxwell, December 11 [with 42561/06]. Arguments in reply to Sir N. O'Conor were furnished by the company, in a memorandum dated the 31st May. His Excellency, however, maintained that it was not possible to obtain permission for the use of the third steamer, on the grounds of either ' the firman of 1834, the vizierial letters of 1842 (1841), 1846, 1861, the letter from the Porte of 1875, or the Granville- Musurus negotiations of 1883.' (See Appendix XXXII.) Sir T. Sanderson enquired if there were any means of making a bargain with the Porte to allow the stipulation attached to article 16 of the draft commercial treaty (see Sir W. White's No. 42, Commercial, of the 28th March, 1891, p. 53), being brought at once into operation, but Sir N, O'Conor replied that he was opposed to the suggestion. Sir G. Mackenzie reported towards the latter part of the year that lie was negotiating to secure a lease of the Turkish flotilla on the Tigris, in return for a loan of 91,000Z. to the Turkish Government. The ' Oman ' Company (Oman Ottoman Administration) had come into the hands of the Turkish Civil List, and was abolished in March 1904, when the line was reorganised under the style of the Hamidieh Steam-ship Administration. Article 2 of the proposed lease was intended to secure a monopoly of the Tigris and Euphrates River Navigation (with the exception of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany's concession), but Sir N. O'Conor pointed out that its effect was stultified by article 9 of the Bagdad Railway Convention, which opened up the possibility of a German line of steamers navi gating the Mesopotamian rivers, and absorbing much of the river traffic. 1906. —During this year the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company again urged that representations should be made to the Porte {or permission to use a third steamer, and in structions were sent to the embassy at Constantinople to apply .for temporary per mission in view of the accumulation of British goods at Bussorah. According to Colonel Picot, the company were willing to fly the Turkish flag, and to amalgamate with the Hamidieh administration. f0872 Mr. R. Balfour enquired in May of this year if His Majesty's Government would support a British company formed to take over a concession granted in 1897 to Yacoub Essayie, a Turkish subject, to run a line of steamers on the Tigris and Euphrates above Bagdad, but enquiries made by the acting consul-general at Bagdad estab lished the fact that the alleged concession was nnt a bond fide one. In the course of a considerable correspondence which took place respecting attacks made by Arabs on Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's steamers proposals were made that the 44 Comet ' should accompany the vessels, that Indian troops should be put on board them, and that a British gun-boat should patrol the Tigris. It was considered advisable, however, to leave to the Turkish authorities the full responsibility of policing the river and protecting traffic. 1907. —After considerable negotiations Sir N. O'Conor concluded an arrangement with the Porte under which the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company was authorised to place a third steamer on the Tigris until such time as the Seniy6 (Hamidieh) administration of the Civil List should have in use twelve cargo steamers in addition to those already plying between Bussorah and Bagdad. The company's third steamer was to fly the Ottoman flag during the course of its voyages. This arrangement was recorded in notes exchanged on the 21st February and the 4th March. The note from the Porte specified the number of steamers then employed by the Seniy^ administration as two, but it was subsequently ascertained that six vessels were actually in use. When the error was pointed out by Sir N. O'Conor (18th March), the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs (1st June) maintained that the arrangement would terminate when the Civil List increased the number of vessels in service to fourteen. In May, Sir N. O Conor received a note from the Porte complaining that the company were exceeding the limits of the arrangement relative to the use of a third steamer by allowing the vessel to tow barges. His Majesty's Government considered that the concession for the third steamer was similar, as regards the towing of barges, to that in virtue of which the company's other steamers had been allowed to tow, but it was left to his Excellency to decide how and 1908— (cont.)

Major F. R. Maunsell, in his Reference Kotes on towns along the Bagdad Railway, stated, in regard to the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab and Tigris and Euphrates, that 'steamers able to cross the bar at the mouth of the Shatt can ascend easily to Bussorah (67 miles from the sea), and vessels of light draft (small gun-boats) can ascend to Kurna. The steamers anchor in mid-stream and all cargo is discharged into lighters. River steamers ascend the Tigris River to Bagdad, but cannot navigate the Euphrates, owin 0- to shoal w T ater in the marshes, about 50 miles above Kurna.' Jn Eebruary of this year a memorandum w^as prepared by the librarian of the Foreign Office on British rights by treaty and otherwise to the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, and the conclusion he drew was that Great Britain could claim, under various treaties between Turkey and foreign Powers, to be entitled to engage in the navigation of the internal waters of the Ottoman Empire- generally for direct trade, and possibly also for internal coasting trade. Sir N. O'Conor reported in March that the Anatolian Railway Company {i.e., the Germans) w 7 ere in negotiation with the lurkish Civil List for the cession of the latter's monopoly of navigation on the Tigris in return for a loan. A proposal w r as made to effect a combine of British firms — including Sir G. Mackenzie (British India Steam Navigation Company), Mr. H. E. B. Lynch, and Mr. D'Arcy—to secure the working of the Turkish steamers. Sir G. Mackenzie and Mr. Lynch w r ere brought into communication, but the latter wanted to obtain the concession for his company, and the matter was, therefore, left in his hands. Sir N. O'Conor forwarded to the Foreign Office a report and chronological memorandum, prepared by Colonel Ramsay, acting consul- general at Bagdad, on the right of British Government vessels to navigate the Tigris above Bagdad, and proposed to inform him that there was no objection to his taking advantage of an opportunity, suggested or favoured by events or special circumstances, to navigate the [163] UEnclosure in Sir N. O 'Conor 'e No. 716, November 26 [39485/07]. 1908. [File 900/08]. river above the town. This proposal was 1907—(con*.) approved. About the same time Colonel Ramsay fur nished a report, in reference to Yacoub Lssayie s alleged eoncession, on the practicability ol steam navigation on the Euphrates for commercial purposes, and observed that, owing to the Hindich barrage obstruction, the absence of a navigable canal from Suklawiya to Bagdad, and o ^ the condition of the river, it was doubtful if such navigation w r ould prove a commercial success. 1908. —Plans for the improvement of the navigation of the Euphrates occupied much attention during the year, the chief questions in this connection being the erection of the Ilindieh barraare and the construction of the Suklawiya Canal. The Hindieh barrage question formed part of a general scheme of irrigation for Meso potamia with which Sir W. Willcocks was associated. Following upon an attack made by Arabs in [ Fil e 11393/08]. the early part of the year upon one of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany's steamers, the ' Blosse Lynch,' river traffic and mail service were suspended for a time. Thereupon the Company suggested that the ' Comet should be sent to patrol the Tigris and to protect their steamers; but. as it was considered that such a step might lead to serious incidents. His Majesty's Government declined to act upon the suggestion. The all airs of the llamidieh Company were reported to be in a state of chaos, and negotia tions were conducted on behalf of Sir G. Mackenzie with the Turkish Government with a view to the purchase of the Company's steamers or the management of their river service, it being understood that the vessels would fly the Ottoman flag. Other schemes, however, were mooted, and the Turkish Minister for Public Works was reported to be in lavour of an arrangement under which Messrs. Lynch (Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company) would abandon their existing rights and combine with the Hamidieh Company in the formation of an Ottoman Navii&gt;ation Company. Later negotiations by Sir G. Mackenzie's agent with the Turkish Civil Sir Mackenzie, List were based on the proposed formation of a Decem^rS 0 ^ Turkish company, with English capital and ^435/0^ Sir G.

Persian Gulf and Bagdad Railway, it was recom mended that the navigation of the Tigris should be developed, that advantage should be taken of any opportunity to encourage British subjects to obtain a concession for improving the waterway, and that no favourable opportunity should be neglected for an extension of the existing British concession, or to assist a British firm, preferably the British India Steam Navigation Company, to acquire the Sultan s steamers. Sir G. Mackenzie (the British India Steam Navigation Company) dropped the proposals [File 322/09J. \ ie had put forward, but negotiations were con tinued throughout the year for the fusion of the navigation rights and interests on the Tigris and Euphrates of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company and the Hamidieh Steamship Company. Messrs. Lynch's agents, on behalf of the former company, arranged with the Turkish Government a draft convention in which it was agreed that the two companies should form a single navigation company, registered in Turkey and subject to Ottoman law, with exclusive rights of navigation between Bussorah and Mosul on the Tigris and between * Bussorah and Meskene on the Euphrates. It was stipulated inter aha that the administration of the combination should be in the hands of a British president, supported by a board of lour British and four Turkish directors ; and that the new arrangement should be in force for a term of seventy -five years, power being retained by the Turkish Government to throw open the Mesopotamian rivers to steam navigation after thirty seven and a-half years, conditionally on indemnification of the company for loss of exclu sive rights and unconditionally after fifty-five and a-half years, from the date of signature of the convention. Article 1 of the draft convention provided that ' les droits de I'exploitation de bateaux a vapeur dans ie perim &amp;tre de la concession, conferes a M. Lynch par les firmans en date du 1834 et 1841 et autres lettres grand -vizirielles, sont76 confi.es, cedes et transfer's a la Societe anonyme 1909— {cont.) ottomane' (the proposed new company); but the Turkish Government insisted upon the inser tion of an additional article (article 29) under 'which, as soon as the firman confirming the con vention should be promulgated and the official transfer to the new company completed, the privileges formerly enjoyed by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company would be completely annulled. This article stipulated that a declaration of annulment should be made by Mr. Lynch and confirmed by the English authorities. Tn regard to the question of annul- [46347/09], ment, Counsel's opinion was taken by the com pany as to whether they would be precluded from regaining their existing rights in the event of the concession granted to the new company being at at any time withdrawn by the Turkish Government, and they were informed by Mr. AV. F. Hamilton, K.C. (the counsel consulted) that they would be entitled in the contingency con templated to claim a restitutio in integrum or equivalent compensation. Thereupon, the com pany asked for an assurance that, should occasion arise, His Majesty's Government would adopt and support the-view expressed by Mr. Hamilton. In the following year this question was referred to the Law Officers of the Crown. Consul-General Ramsay reported that he had proceeded in the ^ Comet' as far as Talibiya, six steaming hours above Bagdad. Sir W. Will- cocks, with his engineers, and some vilavet officials accompanied him, and the right of the steamer on this occasion (December, 1908) to go beyond Bagdad had not been questioned. EarJv in 1909 he endeavoured to renew the practice of free navigation by His Majesty's ships of the rivers of Mesopotamia by sending the ' Comet,' with Sir W. Willcocks on board, up the Euphrates to the Hindieh barrage. This plan for the employment of the 'Comet' was ostensibly put forward by Sir W. Willcocks, but the Grand Vizier stated that there might be objections to the use of the vessel, and recom mended that some other steamer should be hired. Consul-General Ramsay then proposed to accustom the authorities of the Bussorah vilayet at Kurna to the passage of the ' Comet' up the Euphrates on sporting expeditions, and his proposal was approved. Arab disturbances on the Tigris occurred [File 11416/09], Sir O. Lowther. No, 38, January 19 [3125/09]. Sir G. Lowther. No. 263, April 13 [14543/09].[39221/09]. Foreign Office Memorandum (Sir (J.

Schemes for the irrigation of Mesopotamia were put forward by Sir W. Willcocks, and it was feared that the proposed works would tend to render the Tigris and Euphrates unnavigable. In the course of an interview with Sir 0. Hardinge in November, he suggested that a concession should be obtained for the construction of a railwav from Bagdad via Abou Kernal to Damascus, with the right of prolongation to the Persian Gulf. Sir E. Grey considered that the Tigris and Euphrates navigation concessions should not stand in the way of irrigation, and that the Turkish Government could not be opposed if, in view of the irrigation project and suggested railway concession, they insisted upon dropping the Lynch concession. 1910. —In the course of conversation with His Majesty's Ambassador at Berlin on the Bagdad Railway question the German Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to the Lynch con cession, and Sir E. Goschen was instructed to explain to Herr von Schoen,' as the question seemed to be misunderstood in Germany, that British vessels were accorded the right to navigate the Euphrates and Tigris by firmans of 1834 and 1841, and that a company Was formed by Messrs. Lynch in 1862 (1861) for the purpose of navi gating the rivers, since when the firm had maintained their steamers on the rivers ; further, that the Lynch-Hamidieh negotiations merely related to the amalgamation of the Lynch com pany's concession with the Turkish Hamidieh company, and the transformation of w T hat had been for so long a period an entirely British con cession into a Turkish company, in which Mr. Lynch had a share. It was pointed out that no new rights had been acquired, but, on the contrary. Mr. Lynch was surrendering rights enjoyed by him for many years, and amalgamat ing- his interests with those of the Turkish company. The Porte showed a disinclination to give effect to the Lynch -Hamidieh Fusion Convention without obtaining the sanction of the Turkish Chamber; and a Bill was submitted to the [163] X To Sir E. Goschen, No. 7, January 10, 1910. [46381/09]. UfTurkish Parliament, and subsequently became 1910 (cont.) law, defining the powers of the Ottoman Govern ment in regard to the granting of concessions. Enclosure in Sir G. Lowther'a No. 92, February 16 [5976/10]. On the 2 ith January Sir C. Hardinge informed the Turkish Ambassador that, if the proposed fusion fell through, the existing concession of the English company would still hold good, and Ilis Majesty's Government would give the com pany full support in maintaining their rights, and even in exacting compensation if in future years the rivers should run dry owing to irriga tion works undertaken bv the Turkish Govern- * ment. In April the Law Officers advised that His Majesty's Government's assent to the annul ment article of the Fusion Convention should be given with the condition that the English com pany's rights and privileges would be restored in the event of the proposed concession being with drawn before the prescribed time. Considerable opposition to the fusion scheme was mani fested locally and in the Turkish Chamber (which had previously approved it in principle), and in July Messrs Lynch's agent was informed by the Minister of Public Works that the Porte refused to proceed further with To Sir G. Lowther, No. 20. January 30 [3303/10]. Law Officers, April 15 [13244/10]. Sir G.

In reference to the participation of British companies other than the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company in the navigation of the rivers of Mesopotamia, Sir G. Lowther was informed that His Majesty's Government were not pledged to support the Company alone among British firms in applications to the Porte for rights of this nature. Agha Mohammed Jaffer, a Turkish subject, had been running two steamers with barges on the Euphrates for about a year, when the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany called attention to the fact, and proposed to assert their right to navigate the river by sending a tug and barge to make a few trips with a view to the establishment, if practicable, a regular service. The company stated that they were prepared to run the tug under either the British or the Turkish flag, or to form a Sir G. Lowther, No. 311, May 14. [18144/10]. To Sir G.

In a later letter they urged that the Turkish Government, if they altered the status quo on the rivers by the extension of the right of navigation to private persons, should remove the disabilities of the company, who were limited to the employment of three steamers which the Turkish authorities sought to restrict to use on the Tigris only. Sir G. Lowther had previously stated that the Porte and Turkish Parliament were not likely to consider that the old claims of 1846 and 1860 (1861) entitled the company to rim steamers on the Euphrates, and now, in response to a request for his opinion as to the likelihood of the Turkish Government consenting to the ' removal of existing restrictions on the company's rights or to the explicit recognition of their right to ply on both rivers up to the limit of their navigability,' he said that no hope could be entertained of those rights being extended either as regards the number of ^their steamers on the Tigris or their being permitted to ply on the reaches above Bagdad or on the Euphrates. In reference to the grant of navigation permits to Ottoman subjects, and to the proposals made in the company's letter of the 3rd June respecting navigation of the Euphrates, Sir G. Lowther explained that Abdul Hamid's civil list properties in Mesopotamian regions had been transferred on his deposition to the Ministry of Finance, and after the breakdown of the fusion scheme the Government monopoly had been abolished in favour of the principle of throwing open the navigation of both rivers to Ottomans, lie con- sidered it futile, therefore, for the company qud foreigners to apply for a permit to send a tug and barge up the Euphrates, or for a permit to form an Ottoman company to ply on the rivers. 1911. —In reference to a question asked by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company as to the participation of foreign capital in Turkish enterprises for the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates, His Majesty's chargd d'affaires at Constantinople observed that the old regime considered the company's position to be an infringement of the Civil List's {i.e., Government's) monopoly of navigation on the Tigris, and the present Government, while re fraining from any attempt to deprive the company forcibly of their acquired rights, were Ht80 determined that the ri^lit to ply on the two 1911 (con/.) rivers should be rigidly confined to (Htomans.

Consul Crow (Bussorah) saw nothing in the wording of them to prevent foreign capital being employed, although it might be the intention of the authorities to exclude it, provided the nominal owners of the steamers registered as Turkish subjects. British engineers were engaged for the construe-. tion of the l.Iindieh barrage,and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company contracted to transport their materials up the Euphrates; but difficulties were placed in the way of the execution of this arrangement by the local Turkish officials, who apparently feared that the company would refuse to take their special steamers off the river Euphrates and after the work of transport had been completed X igr . i8 s ! &gt;eam .

Temporary permission was given by the Porte in September for the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company's steamers to tow two barges each between Bussorah and Bagdad in order to deal with an accumulation of cargo at the former place. Exception was taken by Sir sir G. Lowther, G. Lowther to a statement in the notice of per- ^ 08, 645 ^ 831, mission that when the accumulation had been November 17 *** disposed of the steamers were not to employ barges at all.

Lowther was asked in January for his opinion whether the action of the Turkish local authorities at Easrdad, in issuing a notice* prohibiting the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates by foreigners constituted an infringe ment of foreign rights, and whether in that case it would be expedient to raise the question from the point of view of British interests, or whether it was to be apprehended that such action on the part of His Majesty's Government might involve the risk of foreign competition on the Tigris. In reply, he stated that he was disposed to agree with the conclusion drawn in the Eoreign Office memorandum, Confidential 8852 (see ante y p. 73), that Great Britain could claim under various treaties between Turkey and foreign Powers to be entitled to engage in direct trading in Turkish internal waters, but he thought that, although the notice was so widely drawn as to prohibit direct trading even with Bussorah, there was no real intention of enforcing anything so unreasonable as such prohibition, and he sug gested that it would be inadvisable, therefore, to make representations to the Porte on the subject. As regards right to 'fluvial cabotage,' Sir G. Lowther considered it impossible to advance a claim with any prospect of success, but he thought the Bagdad notice w T as not likely to affect British interests. In his opinion His Majesty's Govern ment had deprived themselves of the power to insist on whatever rights to participation in 'fluvial cabotage' they might once have been in a position to claim under treaties. He ob served, in support of this view, that the only instance of such trade being carried on was that of Messrs. Lynch (Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company), on the Tigris. Erom the beginning, he said, Messrs. Lynch had been in the position of persons obtaining and enjoying exceptional privileges peculiar to themselves and strictly limited, not rights to which all British subjects—and presumably under most-favoured nation treatment other foreigners—were entitled. He argued that had it been otherwise, and had the rights devolving from the Austrian treaties of 1718 and 1784, the Russian treaty of 1783, and the Belgian treaty of 1838 ever received the sanction of practice it should have been super- [163] Y M 3 I82 fluous for Sir S. Canning to conclude the 1912— {cont.) arrangement of 1840, and for Messrs. Lynch to obtain the special vizierial letter ' renewing to them in particular the privileges already secuucd to all British subjects under the arrangement of 1846.'' Kemarking that the Turkish Govern ment had always regarded the company as enjoying anomalous privileges not treaty rights, and that His Majesty's Government had been drawn by force of circumstances and the tem porary exigencies of negotiations into acquiescence in the Turkish view, Sir G. Lowther went on to say that the British case had been vitiated further by article 10 (article IS in final draft) of the draft commercial treaty with Turkey, in which His Majesty's Government showed readi ness to recognise the right of the Porte to reserve not only ' fluvial cabotage' but also ' petit cabotage' in the Sea of Marmora, the Gulf of ♦Smyrna, &amp;c., to the Ottoman flag, while Messrs. Lynch's rights on the Tigris between Bagdad and Bussorah were to be safeguarded in a special 44 protocole final.' Sir G. Lowther was instructed to inlbfm the To Su G .txnrther, Porte in writing that His Majesty's Government t'.' 2C2 V regarded the vali's notice as an infringement of Ma &gt;' K1 '' the rights conferred by articles 1 and (&gt; of tlie ' 17M0,12 J- Austrian 8ened of the 24th February, 1781, but he feared that to invoke the Soned thus suddenly girG.

Prior to this incident the company proposed to run the 44 Bulbul,' with two barges, on steam trials between Kurna and Fao, but the Vali of Bussorah refused permission on the ground that the company would be exceeding the special permission limited to the use of three steamers, and the ee Bulbul' was only allowed to run one trial from Bussorah to Eao and back. Instructions were issued to Sir G. Lowther to make a written protest against the vali's action, and to point out that the Porte, having conferred on the company the right of navigating the river, must be held to have conferred upon them, at the same time, the right of taking necessary measures for the purpose of such navigation, including the performance of trial trips. He considered it advisable, however, not to address a complaint to the Central Government, but suggested instruct ing the consul at Bussorah to inform the vaM that his Majesty's Government did not under stand the objection to unrestricted trials, and that the right would be reserved to demand an unrestricted trial whenever the question might arise again. In connection with this matter the company asserted that the river was free to navigation as far as Kurna, but the consul at Bussorah regarded the point as disputable, and Sir G. Lowther there upon enquired what the views of His Majesty's Government were oh the question. Permission to tow a seoond barge, given to tho Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany in the previous September, was withdrawn in March of this year when less than half the accumulated cargo, in respect of which it was granted, had been transported. Correspondence with the Constantinople Embassy and the com pany ensued as to the interpretation of the permission given in 1911. At the end of May the incident terminated in the issue of permission for the company to tow two barges for the sole and exclusive purpose of transporting the accumulated cargo. Under article 9 of their concession the Bagdad Railway Company were entitled to carry build- ino* materials for their railway in their own 0 [163] ZB8®B533333B0UKOUBOUHUKMUJbUJU!i.. xiwi. n'' 84 vessels. In Mtireli the Dupbrates anil l igiis Steam Navigation Company informed the Foreign Office that they had come to an arrangement with the Bagdad Railway Company ior the formation of a syndicate or company (to he registered in Belgium) to provide steamers and barges for the transport of railway material from Bussorah up the rivers of Turkish Arabia. These vessels were to be leased by the syndicate to the railway company, and were to be removed from the inland waters of Turkey after the railway had been constructed, unless the Ottoman Government agreed to some scheme for their future employment. It was proposed that the steamers, if permission could he obtained from the Porte for the purpose, should carry general cargo on the downward voyages. Further, the agreement provided for the conversion of the syndicate into an Anglo-German-Turkish com pany. The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Naviga tion Company promised to give His Majesty's Government six months* notice before trans ferring to others the whole or part of their interests in the syndicate or proposed Anglo- German-Turkish Company. When submitting a revised draft of the proposed Anglo-Turkish convention for the establishment of a Shatt-el-Arab Navigation Commission, in which was to be vested the control of the river from Kurna to the sea, the Interdepartmental Committee reported that they had omitted the original article (No. 18' relative to the custom whereby British war-ships freely ascended as far as Kurna. This omission was based on the ground that it might be awkward to raise discussion respecting a custom which had been acquiesced in, if not explicitly recog nised, for a great many years, and which His Majesty s Government could in no case abandon. A memorandum was communicated to the Ottoman Government on the 18th July relative to the questions of the Bagdad Railway, Persian Gulf, and Turkish customs increase. Certain conditions were attached 'by His Majesty's Government to the proposals contained therein for an arrangement respecting the Bagdad Railway question, and these included a stipula tion that permission should be given for three British steamers to navigate between Bagdad and Bussorah in addition to the number already allowed. 1912— {cont.)

Local Turkish action in objecting to the entry of foreign vessels into the rivers of Mesopotamia was reported by the consul at Bussorah in July. The Yali of Bussorah appears from this report to have refused permission for the launch of a French subject to go up the Euphrates, and to have acted similarly in the case of the launch of an American citizen. The vali, in conversation with the Russian consul, maintained that the Ottoman Government possessed indisputable right to close the Shatt-el-Arab to all foreign ships from the junction of the Turco-Persian frontier with the Shatt-el-Arab near Moham- merah upwards, and also both the Tigris and the Euphrates, but, for purely commercial reasons, did not intend to avail themselves of the right below Bussorah.

Vizierial letter of the 2nd July, 1862, which was identical in terms with that of 1862. the 15th January, 1861, and was issued when the company's first steamer was placed on the Tigris. Permission for the company's second steamer to be placed on the Tigris given 1864. by the Porte the 1st October, 1864, on condition that the ' Comet' (Bagdad residency steamer) was withdrawn. The Pasha of Bagdad contended that the vizierial letter of 1861 sanctioned the employment of two steamers only. Permission for the provisional retention of the ' Comet' was given subsequently. Permission given by the Porte (February 1865) for the ' Satellite ' (Government 1865. steamer then at Bussorah) to replace the company's vessel 'City of London.' Porte informed by the British Ambassador in March 18(i5 that the ' Comet' and ' Satellite ' were employed by virtue of the agreement (firman) of 1834. The ' Satellite ' was withdrawn from the Tigris in October 1865, and sent back to India. Permission given by the Porte on the 13th July, 1869, for the ' Comet' to be 1869. replaced ' par un autre navire du batiment de la Marine Royale.'

Employment of the 'Despatch' authorised by the Porte (March 1875) in 1875, exceptional cases when the water was low. Company's application to replace the ' City of London ' by a new steamer refused 1874. by the Porte (7th May, 1874), on the ground that the company had on the Tigris four vessels (including presumably the ' Comet'' and the ' Despatch ') instead of the two allowed by firman.* Permission given by the Porte for a new steamer to replace the ' City of London,' 1875, on condition that the number of vessels authorised by firman was not increased (March 1875). * The firman or special firman referred to by the Porte from time to time was presumably the firman of 1834, or the firman of 1841 which confirmed it.

Application made to the Porte to issue a firman sanctioning the employment of the proposed extra steamer refused (May 1870). Porte maintained (16th December, 1880), in reference to the company's claim to tow barges, that the navigation of the Euphrates [s?c] was not open to foreign flags^ that Messrs. Lynch were authorised by 'special firman ' to employ two steamers on the river, but not to increase their ' materiel flottant.' Similar language held by the Pasha of Bagdad.

In a later note (20th June, 1883) he stated that the restriction as to the number of vessels permitted to be employed had been faithfully recognised. Porte prohibited traffic of company's steamers on the Tigris, contending that the privilege accorded was for the Euphrates only.

A command to ray Vizier, Ali Riza Pasha, actual Governor-General ot Bagdad, Bussorah, and Sliehr-i-Znr, whose glory endure ! THE question of a grant of permission on the part of my august Government for the stationing of two steam -vessels on the River Euphrates in (the Government of) Bagdad by the Government of England, and their alternate plying for the purpose of facilitating commerce, having been formerly mooted and requested by the embassy of the said Government resident in my capital; and my will and pleasure for the granting of such permission having been signified for such stationing of the said two steamers on the said river and their alternate plying, provided that, as was stated, mutual advantages should result, and no inconvenience be caused thereby, august rescripts were issued, addressed separately to thee, the said Governor-General, and again separately, addressed to the requisite parties on the right and left banks of the said river; and furthermore, as the commander of the said steamers, the Englishman named Captain Lenj (Lynch), having lately come to my capital, has now returned to that region (of Bagdad or the Euphrates), it has been requested, in an official note by the embassy of the said Government, that an august rescript be again issued for the necessary assistance and requisite personal consideration to the aforesaid (commander) in the due performance of his service. It has been ascertained by reference to the records that august rescripts were so issued from my Imperial Chancery, and therefore my exalted will and pleasure was attached thereto, for the execution in accordance therewith. In consequence, my Imperial Majestic Sovereign command in the matter has issued and emanated in honour, according to the benign tenour of which the present august rescript has now again been issued and accorded. Wherefore, when the matter snail become known to thy sagacity, thou shalt take due care and exert judgment for the plying of the said steamers as heretofore, and for the execution of the necessary assistance and requisite personal consideration to the aforesaid commander in the due performance of his service First decade of Rejeb, 1257. APPENDIX V. Vizierial Letter to Pasha of Aleppo, dated September 16, 1841 (28 Rejeb, 1257), giving Crews permission to land at Belis. (Translation.) YOUR Excellency knows that two English steam-boats are navigating in the River Euphrates for commercial purposes. The British Embassy has now given a ' tacrir' to say that in consequence of the shallowness of the waters in this season, the steamers were under the necessity of stopping till the river becomes navigable again at Belis, a place within the limits of the pashalic of Aleppo; that, as it has become necessary for the crews to land on the shore, it is desirable that permission should be given to them to land temporarily, and that they may be assisted and protected. At the same time you have stated in a despatch we have received from vour Excellency that, owing to the Arabs of that neighbourhood being a set of unreasonable people, it will be difficult, were the crews of the steamers aforesaid to receive any harm from them, to put a stop to it. lour observation is, in fact, just, and the embassy does not deny it. Nevertheless, acting on this occasion with that prudence and that excellent judgment which distinguish you, and in conformity to the sincere and perfect friendship existing between the two Governments, your Excellency will permit the landing and the staying of the crews in that place for a certain time. You are instructed to employ all possible means to prevent any kind of mischief being done to them, and to afford to them all the protection and assistance you can; and it is in order to engage you to take proper measures to effect all that that I wrote this letter, on receiving which your Excellency will, I hope, act conformably to it. 28 Eejeb, 1257. APPENDIX VI. Major Rawlinson to Sir Stratford Canning. Bagdad, September 3, 1^5. realiK itif^ ^f U 1 ^ A \ a ^. ma( ^ e to me by the authorities of this place some months ago for the Entrlisli VJot ^ in -u' w kich were stated to be owing by various parties at Bagdad enjoying Government sen^' a8 or Russian subjects, or in virtue of their employment in thefm- iUi- I objected to the demand at the time, on the ground of the long period during which British dependents at this place had been exempted from similar liabilities, and I imagined that the plea had been admitted. It appears, however, that the authorities deemed it their duty to refer the question to Constantinople, and having received instructions in reply to levy the objectionable taxes on all parties indiscriminately, they have again addressed me on the subject, and have intimated that unless I can produce an order for special exemption, they must at once proceed to a realisation of the amount. Under these circumstances, I do myself the honour to present your Excellency with a memorandum of the claims, and to subjoin a few remarks in explanation of them. About twenty years ago, a tax named ' Qalibiyeh ' was instituted at Bagdad upon the river craft, in order to supply funds for the repair of the bridge, but as it was understood to be an irregular exaction; it was not attempted to be levied on boats in the hands of British subjects. The tax becoming productive was shortly afterwards diverted from its original purpose, and incorporated in the established sources of Crown revenue, the exemption of British subjects from its operation being at the same time tacitly conceded. That exemption it is now proposed to abrogate, and it becomes necessary, therefore, to examine the principles which may be involved in the application of the tax. The river boats belonging to British merchants at Bagdad are employed in two different species of traffic. During the favourable season they convey native produce to Bussorah for exportation and return with cargoes of British goods, while at other times they are made use of to supply the town with fire-wood, salt, and other articles of daily consumption, which are found upon the banks of the Tigris. The ' Qalibiyeh ' duty is applied in different proportions to -every trip which such a boat may make ; it is calculated in reference to distance and tonnage, and may be assumed therefore to be levied on the cargo rather than the vessel. If such be the case, then the tax must be considered in its application to native produce intended for internal consumption as an oppressive levy, but one of which our merchants cannot complain as long as the most favoured classes of Turkish subjects are equally subject to it, while in regard to the trade with Bussorah it can hardly be regarded otherwise than as an infraction of the treaty, inasmuch as it is in excess of the 12 per cent, leviable on exports and the 5 per cent, upon imports. • It is further necessary that I should point out to your Excellency that the c&lt; Qalibiyeh duty leviable at Bagdad varies altogether in principle from the taxes which are imposed upon vessels navigating the river by the Arab chiefs upon the banks, and which formed the subject of a reference made to your Excellency by my predecessor in 1843 (1842). Those taxes, amounting on each trip to about 1,500 piastres, your Excellency considered to be in a certain degree legitimatized by long usage, by their application to the vessel rather than to the cargo, and by their forming a perquisite of the Arab chiefs, for which, in event of their suppression, the I urkish Government would be bound to afford indemnification. The present tax, on the contrary, is novel in it# application to British boats; it bears directly upon the cargo, and it accrues immediately to the Government in excess of their legitimate dues, and without producing any advantage to the merchant either in regard to security or accommodation. . • If your Excellency concur in the view of the case which I have adopted, you ma}' peshapb think it advisable to procure a vizierial letter to the authorities at Bagdad, sanctioning the application of the ' Qalibiyeh' tax to British boats when they have cargoes of native produce intended for internal consumption, but confirming the exemption from its operation, which our merchants have hitherto enjoyed, when they load their boats with native produce .or exportation, or with British goods and manufactures.

Bagdad, November 12, 1845. presented to Neiib Pasha the letter from the Grand Vizier terming enclosure to ■ ' ' - - - 11 1 '— c J 1 ~' his (No. 46.) I HAVE r ^ , v your Excellency's despatch 'No. 2 of the 20th ultimo, and have been informed by Excellency in reply that he is prepared to defend the kalibieh duty from the possible imputation of being an infraction of the commercial treaty, and that he shall accordingly forward a detailed report upon the subject to the Government at Constantinople. The ground, no doubt, which Nejib Pasha will take up in supporting the legality of the tax in question is that it is levied on the boat and not upon the cargo, and that such boats, being Turkish bottoms, cannot be exempted from its operation by the mere accident of foreign proprietary. He will probably, moreover, show that when the boats are loaded with native produce for internal consumption, even supposing the tax to apply to the cargo, there will still be no infringement of the treaty as long as the liability extends in equal proportions to native merchants. It will be extremely difficult, I think, if not impossible, to decide this question of applicability to boat or cargo; for, if your Excellency should show, by the memorandum appended to my despatch No. 36, that the rates vary according to the nature of the burthen and the locality from whence it comes, the Turkish authorities will still have it in their power to draw a distinction between a tax upon different species of cargo and a tax on a boat loaded with different species of cargo, as they have actually done in the case of rafts descending the river from Mosul. I would venture therefore to suggest that, if your Excellency think it advisable to apply for a complete exemption from the kalibieh tax in favour of British merchants, the instructions to the Bagdad Government on the subject should be specific and absolute, and should be issued in confirmation of an ancient privilege rather than in counter action of a new abuse. As long as the liability or otherwise of British merchants to the tax in question is made to depend upon a distinction between cargo and a boat loaded with cargo, their right will always be subject to invasion, and even were this distinction to be overruled, weie a tax, m fact, upon a boat laden with native produce for exportation, or with British goods anr manufactures, to be placed in the same category with a direct levy upon such native produce or such British goods, the object would still be but half accomplished; for, as I have a rea y explained to your Excellency, the river boats belonging to our merchants are employed for a const era^ e penoc of the year in the transport of native produce intended for internal consumption, and e provisions, therefore, of the treaty, which refer exclusively to duties on import and export, would m such cases be inoperative. 1 _ r. f ' al ;. e ,1 ' s opportunity also of reporting to your Excellency that I have been informed the onlv « TnrwTT 6 ' orders from the Porte, has it in contemplation to demand that not be Ltin* 1 S u , l ub ^ Uut ? d for the ensign hitherto borne by the river boats 1 merfhant steLT 6; , navigate the Tigris and Euphrates, but that, in the event of Lrried into effeTIhf 1 llT 'T' the ' Ve , re ' a measure which is likelv to be soon I can have IM^ U f be obliged to perform her voyages under Turkish colours.

With regard to the demands of the Arabs, he observes that, if the vessel be in a condition to resist them, she is at liberty to do so ; but, as his own authority over the tribes who inhabit the marshes is merely nominal, and as their power to impede the passage of any vessel not impelled by steam is undoubted, the owners of the schooner, he adds, must take upon themselves the responsibility incurred by any opposition upon their part to established usage. in conformity with the opinion recorded by your Excellency in your despatch to my predecessor, under date the 28th April, 1842, I shall recommend the captain of the ' Kerbelai'' to raise no question at present respecting the payment to the Arab chiefs, to whose good-will he must be indebted for the possible accomplishment of the ascent of the river; but, after Turkish boats possessed by British owners, or owners under British protection,' have been hitherto permitted for a period of forty years to navigate the river under British colours. I have a strong repugnance in the case of a British boat to acknowledge the right of the Bagdad Government to demand the substitution of a Turkish for an English flag. As the concession of this point, indeed, appears to be equivalent to a concession of our national right of navigating the Mesopotamian rivers for the purpose of trade, I think it better that the vessel in question should incur a loss by demurrage at Bussorah, pending an answer from your Excellency to my present despatch, than that, by appearing under Turkish colours, she should afford a precedent for the renewal of a demand, of which the propriety is certainly doubtful, and which your Excellency, after due consideration, may be proposed to resist. The real question at issue appears to be, whether Bagdad can be considered a port. I referred this point on a previous occasion to Mr. Consul-General Cartwright, and he was clearly of opinion that, if a vessel built and laden at an Indian port could enter the Kiver Euphrates, pass Bussorah, without breaking bulk or paying duty, and land her cargo at Bagdad, the latter place might then be held to be the port of the Tigris, as Sook-esh-Shukh might be considered the port of the Euphrates and Bussorah that of the united rivers. Hitherto we have had no instance of a vessel importing cargo direct from India to Bagdad (nor even of a British merchant-vessel appearing on the Tigris), but the 'Kerbelai' is a case in point. Adapted to river, as well as sea navigation, she can proceed without breaking bulk from Bombav to Bagdad, and if by so doing she can be admitted to have verified the claim of Bagdad to be considered as the port of the Tigris, then, of course, neither she nor any British vessel can be legitimately required to strike the national flag on ascending the river above the town of I would not, in the present state of our relations with the Porte, have^ troubled your Excellency with the discussion of this question had the voyage of the ' Kerbelai ' promised to be an isolated, or even an unusual, circumstance; but not only is the schooner m question destined, as I have before observed, for permanent employment on the waters of Mesopotamia, but I have also within these few days been consulted with regard to our right of ascending ^ rivers by three different British mercantile houses, Messrs. Mills and Co., Messrs Hector and Co., and Messrs Lynch and Co., each of which parties are, it appears, independently, and more 01 less actively, engaged in preparing iron steam-vessels express^ for the navigation of the ^gTis, the obiect being to supersede the present dilatory and uncertain method of bringing go Bussorah to Bagdad by sailing or tracking the river boats.

In the [163—2] * See Appendices VI and VIII. Gsubmitted them subsequently to your Lordship, had the satisfaction to find that they were approved. With these recollections to guide me, I applied to the Ottoman Minister for the removal of those obstacles which Nejib Pasha: had raised to the free navigation of our vessels on the waters under his jurisdiction, and when difficulties were made as to meeting my wishes to their full extent I proposed an arrangement, which, by means of some discussion between the interpreters, and after much delay, was finally accepted and laid before the Sultan. His Highness's assent is not at all likely to be withheld, and as soon as it is given, the necessary instructions will be transmitted to Nejib Pasha and communicated to Her Majesty's Embassy. The substance of the agreement is this : British vessels, qualified to navigate as such, will be allowed to pass up and down the rivers without obstruction under their own flag, paying for the merchandise on board according to the treaty of Balta Liman, and staying to carry on the internal traffic at their pleasure. British-owned boats or vessels built in the country and employed in the internal trade will pay duty on the same terms, but will not be allowed to bear the national colours. Those vessels which pass up the rivers beyond the port of entry will pay an anchorage duty of 5 Turkish piastres on each vessel, a charge considerably less than half the amount levied under that denomination on British vessels here. 1 trust, my Lord, that by making this arrangement I have permanently secured to our merchants the right of navigating the waters of Mesopotamia under the protection of their own national flag as high as the draught of the vessels which bear it will allow, while the charges to be levied on their merchandise are only those which we could not, with any show of justice or shadow of propriety, refuse. With respect to the country-built boats, which Major Rawlinson describes as having enjoyed the use of British colours for many vears, I can only submit that they have enjoyed that advantage illegally as regards the laws' of the United Kingdom; and that although I should be glad, tor the sake of appearance, to spare their owners the fancied humiliation of a change, I cannot forget that they are now to be exempted from every charge other than that upon the goods on board, and 1 trust also that there will no Jonser be an v distinction between steamers and sailing-vessels. but should I be mistaken in these respects, it is open for your Lordship to obiect to the presentarrangement, and as such objection would no doubt be founded upon a sound view of our rights, there could be no great difficulty in correcting my error.

STRATFORD CANNING. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Sir Stratford Canning to Major Rawlinson* (No. 2.) g- r ' ' Constantinople, March 25, 1846. ' 1. MY late discussions with the Porte respecting the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates by vessels under British colours, and the duties to be paid by our vessels when engaged in that navigation, have terminated in an arrangement which I trust will prove no less satisfactory to the interests concerned than consistent with the principles acknowledged by Her Majesty s Government. _ . 2. British-owned vessels will continue to navigate the waters of Mesopotamia under their national colours equally whether they are engaged in the foreign or in the internal trade, and they will pay upon the'merchandise which they convey the amount of duties respectively applied to each case by the convention of Balta Liman. 3. In the event of their being employed above the usual ports of entry in the internal traffic of the country, they will be liable to the anchorage duty which is always paid here, and which is sanctioned by the Capitulations; but instead of paying 12 piastres as levied upon each vessel in the harbour of Constantinople, they will only pay 5 piastres. 4. There is no question of any difference between steamboats and sailing vessels. 5. With respect to vessels built in the country and owned by subjects of Great Britain, which cannot by our own regulations legally carry the national flag without registration under British authority, they will not pay higher duties than those required of the most favoured class of natives engaged in the internal trade, but they must be content to navigate like other vessels of the country. Though it is not impossible that such vessels as have hitherto abusively enjoyed the privilege of carrying their national colours may be tacitly allowed through favour to carry on the same practice, it would not, I conceive, be proper for any British authority to support a claim which is manifestly at variance with the enactments of own legislature, be the state of Turkish law what it will. 6. The prospects which are opening to our trade in the eastern part of this Empire, and the importance which may justly be attached to the free navigation of its great rivers wherever our vessels can find a sufficient depth of water for that purpose, have made me anxious to place our very natural, though somewhat doubtful, claims upon a sound footing, sanctioned bv the acknowledgment of the Porte itself. This object could only be attained by frankly admitting such of its pretensions as we could not in fairness or consistency dispute. The moment was favourable, and I was unwilling to neglect it. 7. I am not, however, yet in possession of the Grand Vizier's instructions to Nejib Pasha. The council has sanctioned the proposal submitted to it by the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs, but until the formal confirmation of the Sovereign be given, it cannot be made the subject of a definitive order to the provincial authorities. 8. The only object therefore of this despatch is to apprise you of the arrangement which is contemplated. I venture to hope that it will be in my power to send you a copy of the instructions destined for Nejib Pasha by the ensuing post. In the meantime, it will be a o-reat satisfaction to me to find that the view which I have taken of this question accords in general with the result of your local observation and experience.

I have every reason to believe that the British merchants connected with this part of the Turkish Empire have been alone deterred from establishing steam-vessels on the Tigris by the uncertainty which has hitherto prevailed as to a right ot navigation, and the duties to which such navigation would be liable. ^Now that all question on the subject is removed, their plans will, no doubt, be carried to matmity.

But, as Colonel Rawlinson states, this concession was useless, because the sea-going vessels from foreign countries cannot go higher than Busaorah, which is 570 miles from Bagdad. Under these circumstances, and the Porte having never granted immunity from local or river duties, that is, duties not prescribed by the tariff, to any but sea-going British merchant- vessels, I conceived, and Her Majesty's consul-general concurred with my opinion, that the desideratum was to obtain exemption from local or river duties for British goods, imports and exports, and all the privileges of the tariff for them in their transport from Bussorah to Bagdad. By obtaining at the same time the insertion in the vizierial letter of an order that Her Majesty's consul-general at Bagdad should, in conjunction with the Turkish authority, place on a cheap and equitable footing the freight of the British imports and exports in question, I obtained a further guarantee for their cheap and unobstructed transport from Bussorah to Bagdad.

He divided the boats in question into two classes— bond fide British vessels and native boats owned by British subjects. He obtained—or thought he had obtained—from the Porte a recognition that the former class of vessels should navigate the rivers of Mesopotamia up to Bagdad' subject to no further tax than a fee on anchorage. He conceded on his own part the liability ot the second class of vessels to the same transit duties which were levied on boats owned by Turkish or Arab merchants. That his Excellency adopted this broad view of the P L m ? P ! e8 0 , ? arrangement is evident from his letter to me announcing the compromise he had effected, extract of which is annexed. 0 r In the instructions, however, addressed by the Grand Vizier to the Governor of Bagdad in execution ot the arrangement a clause was inserted which rendered the Porte's concession «n S t a n Wi 0 ! ^AT 8 ' J 561 '*, erroneously assumed to be a river navigable to sea-go,ng vessels up to Bagdad—that ig, to a d,stance of 570 miles from its mouth-the immunity from S taxationwaerestnoted to British vessels sailing up with a British cargo and returnine to sea with an export cargo of Turkish produce.

Vizierial Letter to the Pasha of Bagdad, January 15, 1861 (3 Rejeb, 1277). (Translation.) THE British Embassy having recently made certain communications for the purpose of obtaining a renewal of the orders which were sent concerning the British steamers and boats authorised by His Majesty to ply on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, it has appeared from the register that, permission having on a former occasion been applied for by it to station two steamers on the River Euphrates at* Bagdad, and to run them by turns, for the purpose of facilitating trade, two firmans, dated rftspectively the end of Shaban 1250 (1834), and the beginning of Rejeb 1257 (1842),t were addressed to the late Governor-General of Bagdad, Ali Riza Pasha, authorising the permanent station of two steamers on that river, providing it were proved and established that the advantages resulting therefrom would be mutual, and that no i sort of inconvenience would ensue therefrom. Further, that in virtue of a report received | respecting the dues payable by vessels and boats navigating the Euphrates and Tigris, and in conformity with the request of the British Embassy for vizierial instructions, on the ground that British merchant-vessels might trade in those two rivers after payment of the fixed dues according * This should be 'in the Government of.' | This should be 1841, see p. 9 of the Chronological Table.. ■ — • : 1 vz +n trPflfv and considering that the transport of goods from one point on those two rivers to anotherfwithout going out to sea, is, in fact, internal trade, and that under such circumstances vessels under whatsoever flag it may be, must pay the same dues as Ottoman vessels or boats, and that British vessels, whether coming loaded from abroad and entering one of tho ® e rivers with their cargoes, or issuing therefrom to the sea laden with Ottoman produce, and bound for foreign countries, after having paid the dues payable on their cargo according to the treaty and tariff, are only liable to the payment of 'palamar aktchesi (t.«. right of mooring), or cable money, on entering or leaving the Tigris or Euphrates, like all ^ er p fo J el 1 ^« hl P 1 %^^^f^ other parts of the Ottoman Empire. For these reasons, on the 6th Rebml-akhii, 1262 (1846), instructions were sent to Bagdad directing, as above, that the same dues should be levied on British merchant-vessels engaged in internal trade as on boats belonging to Ottoman subjects, and that after the custom-house duties payable on their cargoes shall have been levied on merchant-ships of the same nation, either coming from abroad or going abioad, a sum of 5 piastres cable money should be levied, and that nothing over and above that should be exacted. You will be so good as to act according to the above rules. (Sealed) MEHEMED. 3 Rejeb, 1277 {January 15, 1861). [An order similar in effect to the above appears to have been issued in 1862.] APPENDIX XV. Memorandum handed to the Turkish Minister for Foreign A ffairs in March 1865 {Enclosure in Mr. Stuart's No. 123 of March 14, 1865). BY an agreement made between the Porte and Lord Ponsonby in 1834, permission was given for two British steamers to be employed on the Euphrates, and the ' Comet' and ' Satellite were accordingly sent there. By an arrangement made between the Porte and Sir Stratford Canning in 1846, the Mesopotamian rivers were thrown open to British shipping for trade and commerce, without exclusion of steamers, and without restriction as to numbers. When, however, application was made to the Porte in 1864 for permission for the Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company to place two steamers upon the rivers, the Porte answered that the number of British steamers admitted must be restricted to two, and that permission for the two new ones could only be granted upon the understanding that upon their arrival the old ones would be withdrawn. The ^ Comet' and ' Satellitehave been of immense use to the Ottoman Government at various times, and have latterly performed good service in connection with the Indo-European telegraph. It is difficult to understand why the Porte should desire their withdrawal. The British Government would look upon their removal as an act of great discourtesy, particularly at a time when Namik Pasha appears to have encouraged the formation of a French steam packet company in the same waters. It is to be hoped that the Ottoman Government will show a more friendly spirit in this matter, and permit both the ' Comet ' and the ' Satellite ' to remain in the rivers upon the same footing as formerly, until it may suit the convenience of the British Government to withdrawal them. If the Porte has any valid ground of complaint against those vessels, such complaint would no doubt be readily listened to by the British Government. An early decision has become necessary, as the time has nearly arrived when the two vessels must be withdrawn to India, if the Porte persists in refusing to aftcede to the request of the British Government for their retention. Might not the present opportunity be a good one for throwing open the Mesopotamian rivers to the commercial nags of all nations ? Such a measure would give to foreign nations their legrtmiate share of commerce in those waters; but to Turkey herself the advantage of the measure would be infinitely greater, as, besides being a means of civilising the lawless tribes, it would be hkeJy to prove a source of immense wealth and prosperity, by promoting the rapid development of the resources of that fertile portion of the Empire.

That Sir Charles Dilke was to-request that we would take those papers into our consideration and favour vour Lordship with our opinion : Firstly, as to how tar the geneia ngi o naviga e the Euphrates and Tigris could be claimed for British vessels under the arrangement of 1846. Secondly, whether the right claimed by the Euphrates and ligris Steam NaMga ion ompany o tow barges on those rivers, could properly be maintained. In obedience to your Lordship's commands we have the honour to Report— That the evidence of the arrangement made by Sir Stratford Canning in 184(3, and of the nature of the rights which it confers, consists almost exclusively of his despatch ol the 18th aic i, 1846, in which he informs Her Majestv's Government that the arrangement has been arnvf &lt; a . The only document under the hand of any representative of the Turkish Government on which reliance can be placed as affording against them evidence of the arrangement is, so far as we aie aware, the despatch of Raouf Pasha to the Governor of Bagdad of the 2 ik I April, 1846. lhat despatch appears to be chiefly concerned with questions of tariff, and of the duties to be levied on foreign as compared with Turkish vessels. It is not an announcement of an arrangement conceding to British vessels the right to navigate the Rivers ligris and Euphrates under their own flag, though it certainly by inference seems to recognise the fact that vessels under the English flag have been navigating, and will continue to navigate, those rivers for the purpose of internal commerce. And if, subsequent to that despatch, British commercial steamers, in continuance of prior usage, had navigated the rivers with no warrant beyond what is contained in it, and without objection by the Turkish authorities, these facts, coupled with the despatch of Raouf Pasha, would afford cogent evidence against the Turkish authorities that an arrangement rendering this course legitimate had been entered into. It appears, however, that no British steamer was placed upon either the Tigris or Euphrates prior to the year 1862 except the two vessels which had been navigating them before 1846, under the authority of the firman of the 29th December, 1834. It is necessary, therefore, carefully to examine the circumstances which intervene between the date of the an-angement in question and the year 1862. It appears that, in 1859, Messrs. Lynch and Co., having in view the establishing a line of steamers on the Tigris and Euphrates, entered into communication with Sir H. Bulwer, at that time Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople. Sir H. Bulwer (whether from having overlooked the agreement of 1846 or from some other cause does not appear) expressed the view that Messrs. Lynch could not, without further authority from the Turkish Government, claim the right permanently to navigate the river with steamers carrying the British flag. But the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Sir H. Bulwer, in answer to his enquiries, that if Messrs. Lynch were to apply to the Porte for a firman of concession to establish a line of steamers to run between Bagdad and Bussorah the Porte would, he thought, not be averse to an arrange ment of that nature. Upon this Messrs. Lynch submitted to Sir H. Bulwer an application for a firman ' granting them the requisite sanction to navigate the rivers of the country with British- registered steam-vessels.' No answer was received to this application until 1861. In January of that year Sir H. Bulwer transmitted a vizierial letter to the Pasha of Bagdad. The terms of that document are important. It begins by reciting that the British Embassy had made communica tions for the purpose of obtaining a renewal of the orders sent concerning ' the British steamers and boats authorised by His Majesty to ply on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates.' It then recites the firman of 1884 and the report of 1846 with reference to the duties to be levied on British vessels, and the despatch of Raouf Pasha of the 2nd April, 1846, founded upon it, and it concludes by instructing the pasha ' to act according to these rules.' It is to be observed that this despatch treats as in full force the firman of 1834 authorising the British Government to station two steamers on the River Euphrates at Bagdad, and to run them by turns for the purpose of facilitating trade ; and that the part of the despatch which is more general in its terms and has reference to the vizierial letter of 1846 deals with the financial question only. Ihis seems hardly consistent with the idea that the arrangement announced by Sir Stratford Canning was treated as being then in force, and having the effect to be gathered from his despatch, h or that arrangement, which permitted British merchant steamers without limit of i o 1 1:0 on ri y ers would override the extremely limited authority given by the firman . . * ■ Ad&lt; ^ ^ ie various applications made by Sir H. Bulwer to the Porte resulting in his receiving from them the vizierial instructions of January 1861, were wholly unnecessary if such an arrangement as was communicated to Her Majesty's Government in 1846 was still in force. c n ^ e8sr8 * Ly nc li and Co. placed their first steamer on the rivers. Their second ol owed in the year 1864, and as early as that date the Turkish authorities distinctly asserted that under easting nrmans, only two British steamers were permitted to navigate the Tigris. From la . time to the present, the Government of Turkey has persistently adhered to that position. The use of more than two steamers has during all this period been only exceptional, and has never een permitted without remonstrance, and the assertion that it could not be claimed as a rig-ht. nese remonstrances appear to have been acquiesced in from time to time, and notably in 'the srr j i English Embassy (if it be correctly quoted by Ali Pasha) in 1864. And the I I . f ^ has '' va ™ u8 occasions aought permission for acts, the title to do which would have been clear under the reported arrangement of 1846.15 Considering, therefore, the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence ot that arrangement so far as iurkish documents are concerned, and that the authority alleged to have been given appears not to have been acted upon, that for nearly twenty years the Turkish Government have practi cally denied its existence, and that Her Majesty's representatives at the Porte so fai from insisting that it existed, and relying upon it, have sought permission which would have been needless if it were m force, we think the general right to navigate the Tigris and Euphrates cannot now be claimed by British vessels under the arrangement of 1846. As regards the second question submitted to us, we think the company are entitled to employ steamers having authority to ply upon the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates for all commercial purposes tor which such vessels are ordinarily employed, and Ave think this would probablv include the towing of barges laden with merchandise. But we would observe that if the only authority for British steamers to run on these rivers is derived from the firman of 1834, as appears to have been insisted upon on the one hand, and acquiesced in on the other, it may be expedient to remember in pressing the matter upon the 1 urkish (rovemment that the firman of 1634 is, as was pointed out by Sir H. Bulwer. a permis sion open to revocation by the Turkish Government. We have, &amp;c. HENRY JAME^. FARRER HERSCHELL. 1 agree with the Attorney- and Solicitor-General in the answer to the first question. With respect to the second question, I regret to differ. I think the permission given to a limited number of steamers to navigate the rivers does not include the leave to tow barges laden with merchandise. At the time of the firman in 1834 towing was not, I consider, in the view of the Turkish Government. No extension of the leave given in the firman has since been conceded. The towing of barges would obviously, to a very great extent, add to the carrying power of the steamers; and such use of the steamers, in my opinion, is not within the intention, and certainly not within the letter, of the permission given by the Turkish Government. I am, therefore, of opinion that the right claimed by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company to tow barges on those rivers cannot properly be maintained. I have, &amp;c. PARKER DEANE. APPENDIX XYITT. jEJarl Granville to Ma sums Pasha. M. VAmbassadeur, Foreign Office, July 5, 1883. HER Majesty's Government have received information by telegram of the sudden stoppage of the navigation of the River Tigris by British shipping, including the regular mail and passenger steamers, and they are at a loss to account for a measure so arbitrary and unfriendly, and which is, at the present time, occasioning most serious inconvenience and prejudice to British subjects and British interests. Your Excellency is no doubt aware that British vessels have enjoyed the privilege of navigating the Tigris for many years. In 1846 Sir Stratford Canning, then Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, concluded an arrangement with the Porte which is recorded in a despatch from the Grand Vizier to the Pasha of Bagdad, dated the 2nd-April ot that year. This document states that the British Ambassador, having represented that British vessels are entitled to trade in the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris on payment of the duties established by treaty, the question had been referred to the Finance Minister, whose report thereon was approved by His Imperial Majesty the Sultjfn; and the despatch proceeds to direct the Pasha of .Bagdad to levy, on British trading vessels, '■ qui, comme il a ^te dit plus haut, seront desormais occupes a faire le commerce interieur sur les deux fleuves susdits,' the same duties as on 1 urkish vessels similarly engaged. , - i j . i These instructions are referred to and confirmed m another despatch, adaressed on the 15th January, 1861, by the Grand Vizier to the Governor-General of Bagdad, m which after referring to certain firmans granted in 1834 and 1841 for the navigation of the Euphrates by two steamers for the purposes of trade, and to the representations of the British Ambassa oi in 1846, which led to the arrangement of that year above referred to, the Grand vizier proceeds to confirm that arrangement, and to direct the Governor -General to act m accoi dance there iliis last-mentioned despatch was addressed to him in consequence of obstacles which he had put in the wav of the navigation* and such was the reluctance of the Bagdad authorities to carry out their orders, that it became necessary to issue a third vizienal despatch to the vai. This despatch, which is dated the 2nd July, 1862, repeated the directions already given to his Excellency to throw no obstacles in the way ot British steamers navigating the Euphiates and Tigris Notwithstanding occasional difficulties with the local authorities, the navigation of t o rivers by British steamers was allowed to proceed. Regular mail and passenger communication has been established between Bagdad and the Indian and European ports and large capital has been invested by British subjects on the strength of the arrangements above re.erred to, and established under the highest sanction.Sir Julian Pauncefote et LOTd Ed — d «t-aunce ob 8 e^qrr 8 t ei n ; 0DneUr ;? e -t r e Excellence fait steamers commandfe en 1834 et en 1841 par le Canltaiue S J v h C0 MP a ?f le L y noh avec ies telle errenr ne changerait en rien le fondle la qnestion En^ffet fjl' '' ^ 8emble T ^X 116 na pas, que je sache, reconnn officicllement 1'existence de , p' le Go ^ ve ™ ement Im Penal tenant aux dispositions des firmans de 1834 et de 1841 fl , Co ™P a g? le Lynch; et, s'eu de naviguer snr I'Euplirate primitivevnVf ' 'j entend mamtenIr ^ permission dans nu but mercantile par le Capitaine Lvnch e ' X &lt;5tea ™ ers . an g lai8 . commandes Pauncefote et Lord Edmond Fitzmauri^ Pal narte de la f\im 'f' 8 . av «« Sir Julian ipsz S.°55 ,ss£x s si'rj rv~r?i' E!* ntS J'ai, &amp;c.

Gentlemen, Foreign Office, February 19, 1884, I HAVE the honour to transmit to you, by direction of the Secretary of State, the papers noted in the accompanying list, and relating to a grave difficulty which has arisen between Her Majesty's Government and the Sublime Porte touching the right lately claimed by the Turkish Government to stop the traffic of the Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company, The vessels of that company have plied for upwards of twenty years on those rivers, carrying the Indian mails and interchanging traffic with the steamers of the British India Company, whereby Bagdad has been brought into direct communication with all parts of India and Europe. The origin of the estabhshment of the company is as follows :— 1 From the records in this Office it appears that since 1834 the Euphrates was navigated for many years by two steamers belonging to the East India Company, and afterwards to the20 I - - Government of India, under a firman of the Porte of the 29th December, 1834, and a vizierial letter of the 13th September, 1842* (copies. Appendix, Noe. 1 and 2). , ^ . It is stated by the Porte that this privilege was accorded by two firmans, the nrst gianted in 1834 and the other in 1841t (copies, Appendix, Nos. 3 and 4). These two steamers were used for the purposes of Colonel Chesney s exploring expedition, which broke up in 1837, and afterwards for commercial purposes, under the command ot Captain H. # B. Lynch, but always as Government steamers (E, p. 1). ^ . . i v» • • i i • From a much earlier date a trade has been carried on in the Tigris by British subjects in native vessels carrying the British flag, and paying no dues (K). .-i d ,i In 1845 disputes arose as to the payment of dues by those vessels, and Nejib Fasha, then Vali of Bagdad, questioned the right of British subjects to navigate the rivers at all under the British flag. &gt; j j a- o r j The matter was reported by Major Rawlinson, Her Majesty s consul at Bagdad, to bir btrat lord Canning, Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, who thought it expedient that occasion should be taken of this incident to regulate the whole question of the navigation of those rivers by means of a direct understanding with the Porte, He accordingly entered into negotiations with the Grand Vizier, the result ol which was reported in his despatches No. 45 of the 18th March and No. 53 of the 4th April, 1846 (Appendix, No. 5). In those despatches Sir Stratford Canning states that an ' agreement' had been arrived at as to the right of British vessels to navigate those rivers, and as to the amount of dues payable by British subjects carrying on the ' internal trade ' on the rivers; and he records the agreement in the following terms :— ' The substance of the agreement is this : British vessels, qualified to navigate as such, will be allowed to pass up and down the rivers without obstruction under their own flag, paying for the merchandise on board according to the treaty of Balta Liman, and staying to carry on the internal traffic at their pleasure. British-owned boats or vessels built in the country and employed in the internal trade will pay duty on the same terms, but will not be allowed to bear the national colours. Those vessels will pass up the rivers beyond the port of entry will pay an anchorage duty of 5 Turkish piastres on each vessel, a charge considerably less than half the amount levied under that denomination on British vessels here.' He transmits copies of his correspondence with Major Rawlinson, in which he distinctly explains that while native boats owned by British subjects must no longer carry the British flag, a practice which was illegal by British law, British vessels entitled to carry the British flag will be allowed to navigate the rivers under their national colours, whether engaged in the internal trade only or in the foreign trade, subject to the payment of the dues applicable to such trades respectively, and that no distinction would be made between sailing-vessels and steamers. Sir Stratford in his despatch to Major Rawlinson of the 4th April, 1846, transmitted to him a copy of a letter from the Grand Vizier to Nejib Pasha, the Vali of Bagdad, informing him of the agreement, and instructing him to carry it out. I am to invite your particular attention to the terms of that letter (which you will find in Appendix No. 6), because it is contended by the Porte that it applies solely to native boats belonging to British subjects and carrying on the internal trade on the rivers under the British flag, and has no reference to sea-going British vessels. Previously to 1862 no British steamers appear to have navigated the rivers except the Government steamers authorised on the Euphrates by the firmans of 1834 and the vizierial letter of 1842* (Appendix, Nos. 1 and 2) ; and nothing appears to have occurred in relation to the agreement of 1846 until 1859, when Messrs. Lynch and Co.. being desirous of establishing a line of steamers on the Tigris and Euphrates, applied to Sir H. Bulwer, then Her Majesty's Ambassadors at Constantinople, for information as to their right to do so. Sir H. Bulwer, who had apparently overlooked Sir Stratford Canning's agreement of 1846 expressed .the opinion that Messrs. Lynch and Co. could not, without farther authority from the Porte, claim the right to put steamers on the river under the British flag. But the Turkish Minister for 1 oreign Affairs having intimated that the Porte would not be averse to grant to Messrs. Lynch and Co. a firman for that purpose, the latter submitted to Sir H. Bulwer an application for that privilege. L ^ nch a ^ d Co -' of London, addressed a letter to the Foreign Office, dated the Jth t ebruary, 1860, stating that they had an order from their house abroad lo purchase a steamer to trade between Mohammerah, Bussorah, and Bagdad, and enquirintr whether an English company had a right to navigate those foreign waters. 1 he reply to that enquiry was as follows:— &lt;k Gentlemen, , t &amp; . . f lt l pL a ' n dlrectecl .

A copy of that letter will be fonnd in Appendix No 7 e e ex commeiices by stating that the British Embassy had applied for 'a renewal of the orders concerning the British steamers and boats authorised to ply on the Rivers Tigris and up nat.NS It then recites the two firmans, also the arrangement of 1846, and the instructions sen to the van m pursuance thereof, and directs him to act according to the above rules. It is important to bear m mind that this vizierial letter was the first official document issued on tne subject of the navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris since the agreement of 1846, and t ui it was issued tor the express purpose of the establishment of the company on those rivers. . 1 c .^ vin f t(&gt; instance on the part of the vali, a further order, similar in effect, was sent to him m I' hz. when Messrs. Lynch and Go. put their first steamer on the river. Their second steamer vas put on in 1864. Ihe Porte, however, from that date to the present time, have insisted that the right ot those steamers to navigate the rivers is derived solely from the firman of 1834, and they deny that any such right was conferred by the vizierial letters of 1846 and 1861, rsotwithstaiuling the Foreign Office letter of the 17th February, 1860, above cited, Messrs. L\ nch and Co. appear to have acquiesced in that view, and certainly the action of Her Majesty s Embassy at Constantinople has been quite inconsistent with the right of general navigation claimed under Sir Stratford Canning's agreement of 1846. It seems a matter of surprise that Messrs. Lynch and Co. should not have brought the Foreign Office letter ot the 17th February, 1860, to the notice of Her Majesty's Ambassador; but it has been suggested (B, p. 3) that they were possibly not averse to the limitation of two steamers imposed by the firman of 1834, as securing to them a virtual monopoly. Indeed, as lately as the 25th February, 1875, they addressed a letter to the Foreign Office, in which they stated that the company Avas formed on the faith of a firman under which it was authorised to employ two steam-vessels on the Euphrates and Tigris, and that all they then asked was to withdraw one of those steamers which was old and to substitute for it a new and efficient one. » The attention of the British Embassy was first drawn to the agreement of 1846 in despatch No. 158 of the 30th September, 1874, to Sir H. Elliot. But his Excellency, in his reply (No. 247 of the 20th October, 1874), deprecated agitating the question, and observed that, if Her Majesty's Government relied on general international principles as giving a general right of navigation, the claim would be weakened by a reference to the special permissions in virtue of which the steamers had hitherto plied '(G). The attention of the British Embassy was again drawn to the agreement of 1846 in a Foreign Office despatch, No. 44, Commercial, 16th May, 1881, on the occasion of a dispute as to the right of the company's steamers to tow barges ; but no action seems to have been taken on that despatch, and it will be seen that, as recently as June 1883 (A, p. 14), the embassy, in supporting the claims of the company, have invoked the firman, and not the agreement of 1846. Since the establishment of the company constant disputes have arisen with the local authorities as to the substitution of new steamers for old ones, the right of towing barges, and other matters; but the right of the two steamers of the company to ply on the rivers was never contested until now. In his despatch No. 193 of the lltb- July, 1883 (A, p. 35), Mr. Wyndham, Her Majesty's charge d'affaires at Constantinople, observes that after the correspondence of 1873 and 1874 (G) it will be difficult to induce the Ottoman Government to allow Messrs. Lynch and Co. to run a greater number of vessels than they have done hitherto, taking also into consideration that all the endeavours of Her Majesty's Embassy to obtain permission for them to tow barges have hitherto been in vain. On this part of the case I am to refer you to Sir E. Hertslet's two memoranda (C) and (D), and to the report of the Law Officers of the Crown in 1881 (F). The navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates by the two steamers of the company has thus continued uninterruptedly for upwards of twenty-two years, during which period a great amount of capital has been expended in depots and establishments, and great benefits have been thereby conferred on the commerce of the country. (Memorandum by Sir L. 1 elly (K), paragraphs 8-10.) ^ , u- r xv. In July last intelligence was received of the forcible stoppage of the tramc of the company by the local authorities, whose arbitrary and discourteous action in this matter will be tound described at pp. 26 and following of the Correspondence (A). ^ n ^ • The injurious effect of the stoppage of the company's steamers ^ to British trade genera } is shown in the letters of Mr. Lynch (pp. 72, 94, and 119), of the British India Steam avigation [163—2] 622 Company (p. 18), of Meesrs. Gray, Dawes, and Co. (pp. 27, 71, and 108), of Messrs. Gloyer Brothers (p. 29), of Messrs. Steel, Young, and Co. (p. 29), of the London Chamber of Commerce (p 95) and of Mr Cooke (p. 62), who states that the tonnage visiting the port of Bussorah, which in 1871 was only 7,110 tons, increased in 1882 to no less than 74,760 tons. The immediate obiect which the Turkish Government had in view in stopping the traffic of the company is the desire to secure the exclusive profits of the navigation for an Ottoman company (A, pp. 37 and 120, Nos. 79 and 161). But there is reason to believe that political objects are also connected with their recent action (A, p. 102, p. 64 ; E, p. 5 ; and H, p. 4). Earl Granville, immediately on receipt of the intelligence that the traffic of the company had been stopped by the Turkish authorities, addressed a note to the Turkish Ambassador, dated the 5th Julv, protesting against this proceeding, and expressing fhe hope that the status quo would be re-established pending the friendly discussion of the question between the two Governments (A, p. 21). In a further note, dated the 11th July, his Lordship reserved all rights against the Porte for the consequences of their action (A, p. 26). These remonstrances led to an arrangement, which is recorded in Lord Granville's despatch to Mr. Wyndham No. 131 of the 4th August, 1883 (A, p. 79), under which the company was allowed to resume its traffic, without prejudice, and pending the friendly discussion of the question between the two Governments. In pursuance of that arrangement several interviews have taken place between the Turkish Ambassador and the Under-Secretaries of State at the Foreign Office, for the purpose of discussing the question, and of arriving, if possible, at some amicable solution of the difficulty (H). Those interviews, however, having led to no practical result, the Ambassador was invited to address a note to Lord Granville setting out precisely the grounds on which the Porte defended their action in stopping the traffic of the company. His Excellency accordingly addressed a note to Lord Granville on the 28th ultimo, to which I am now to invite your attention. In that note the Ambassador maintains that the sole right of navigation possessed by the company is derived from the firman of 1834 and a firman of 1841, of both of which he transmits copies (Appendix, Nos. 3 and 4). He denies that a general right to navigate the rivers was ever granted to British vessels, and he proceeds to give his interpretation of the vizierial letters of 1846 and 1861. He argues that if those documents were intended to concede a general right of navigation, the reference to the firmans of 1834 and 1841 in the vizierial letter of 1861 would have been superfluous; that it is impossible to hold that such a right could be accorded by simple vizierial letters; that it must necessarily have formed the subject of a treaty, the benefit of which, moreover, would be claimed at once by all the other Powers entitled to most -favoured -nation treatment. That the vizierial letters had no reference to British vessels entitled to carry the British flag, but only to British-owned native craft which improperly carried the British flag and thus escaped the payment of dues. That the object of the vizierial letters was only to record the decision of the Porte, that British-owned native craft might continue to navigate the rivors on payment of the same dues as the vessels belonging to Ottoman subjects, and that accordingly they had continued to do so to this day, subject to such payment and without carrying the British flag. That the report of the Hotel des Monnaies referred to in the vizierial letter of 1846 was only intended to lay down that native craft owned by foreigners engaged in the internal trade must pay the same dues as vessels owned by Ottoman subjects, and engaged in the same internal trade, and not to decide the question whether British vessels had the right to navigate the rivers, such a question not being within the competence of that department. That owW to the vague terms of the vizierial letters there had been confusion on the part of Her Maiestv^s Government between British vessels entitled to carry the British flag and British-owned native vessels, which caused them to place on those letters an interpretation as erroneous as it was inadmissible. That the company, therefore, in its own interest, would do well to abandon untenable pretensions, and to restrict itself to the privilege conferred by the firmans which was limited to the navigation of the Euphrates only, by two British steamers. As regards the argument that the company's line of steamers has been established for more than twenty years on the Tigris, without objection on the part of the Porte, that a larsre caoital has been expended on its establishment, that it is under contract with the British Government or the carnage of the Indian mail, and that the stoppage of its traffic would give rise to grave complaints on the part of the mercantile interest and in Parliament, his Excellency observes that hf transport of the Indian mails could be effected by a Turkish steamer; that the friendly tolerance of the Porte could not affect its imprescriptible rights; that the expenditure of the company has been amply repaid by its profits; that its establishment on the Tigris has never ceased to give rise to disputes; that the question is not one affecting the interests of British commerce m general but of a private company, and that if the British Parliament and public evinced so much solicitude for a private company, how much more was the Porte bound to safe guard the rights of its subjects in general, and' to secure to them the adva^ navigation, following therein the example of other civilised States- that for nolifiVal « 1 economic reasons, the Porte must insist that the navigation of the Tigris shall be reserved for 0 toman vessels ; finally, that although the privilege accorded by Imperial firman to fw r v u ss^^sfrsssr- 1 — A =»• '• ft Jftitft Hie Excellency concludes by remarking that it had been pointed out that he had confounded23 forTl7 ded by no official knowledge of the company md fh^ fwn ^ r ^ ( l uestlon ' as ^&gt;6 Porte had substituted for the Government steamers'in the enjoy mentTfThr 0 ' '1 COm P an y ^ in fact b een «»^ss»aji , ssr-•ess ss»r±B p„ «— - «** o f i hose arguments give rise to the following questions Cann^ng^clespatcl^No^d of t^e t 18th'Marclf o^Uiat^ear. 1846 ^ ' reCOrded in Sir Stratford since'b v vof e^^ 1 ' 8010 ' 1 ^ y the fl ( ? 0urse of action snowed now claiming the benefirof ^hat a^eement 0f e ' denCe and the C0IlfllCt of interpretation, from (Appendix'l^o. 1 * t TS ^ a F eCT f nt to be abandoned) the vizierial letter of January 1861 Messrs.

Porte 1 here SeemS ' tllerel()re ' insuperable difficulty in establishing the agreement as against the As regards the second question, it was answered adversely to the claim of Her Maiestv's Government by the Law Officers in 1881 (F). Majesty s The third question, therefore, is the one to which Lord Granville desires more particularly to mvite your attention. r J It is conceived that in answering the note of the Turkish Ambassador it is not necessary to abandon the claim of Her Majesty's Government under the agreement of 184H, and the following considerations are submitted as suggesting materials for a reply: 1. The firmans ot which copies are transmitted by the Turkish Ambassador have no reference A i-l' t ^ to the steamers of the Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company, but only to the two reply!^ British Government steamers, which were authorised by those firmans to ply on the Euphrates, and which had ceased to navigate that river long before the company was established. 2. Ihe company was created in 1362, for the purpose of establishing a line of steamers between Mohammerah, J^ussorah, and Bagdad, and in order to prevent any opposition on the pait of the local authorities, the British Ambassador applied to the Porte for a renewal of the orders given to the Vali of Bagdad in a vizierial letter dated the 2nd April, 184t&gt;. 3. That letter had been addressed to the vali in 1846 in execution of an agreement arrived at between Sir Stratford Canning and the Porte, by way of settlement of a dispute concerning the navigation of the rivers by British vessels and the payment of dues in the internal trade. t^ir Stratford Canning, in his despatches ot that date (of which copies are transmitted), reports that the dispute had been settled as' follows : That whereas British-owned native boats had for forty years carried on the internal trade on the rivers under the British flag and without payment of dues, they should in future pay the same dues as the native-owned boats engaged in the same trade. On the other hand, that British vessels entitled to carry the British flag would be entitled to navigate the rivers under their national colours, either for the purposes of the foreign trade or of the internal trade, subject to the payment of the local dues or treaty customs duties applicable to such trades respectively, and as regards British vessels passing up the rivers beyond the customary port of entry (Bussorah), subject to the payment of an anchorage due of 5 piastres only. ' _ 4. In accordance with the request of the British Ambassador in 1861, and in view of the establishment of the steamers of the company on the rivers, the Grand Vizier addressed a letter to the Vali of Bagdad, dated the 15th January, 1861, renewing the orders given in the vizierial letter of 1846. The same orders were renewed again in 1862, when the company put their first steamer on the Tigris, and. opened their line between Bagdad and Bussorah, and that line has been in active operation ever since. The interpretation which the Turkish Ambassador asks Her Majesty's Government to place on the two vizierial letters of 1846 and 1861 appears inconsistent with the express terms of those documents. The Grand Vizier, in the letter of the 2nd April, 1846, after distinctly stating that the British Ambassador had claimed the right of British vessels to trade in both rivers on payment of the dues But see documents (A) and (B) recently extracted, Appendix X. no24 established hv treaty,' cites the report of the Hotel des Monnaies. to which the British Embassy had given its adhesion, and which had been submitted to and approved by the Sultan. That report declares what are the proper dues payable by vessels engaged in the internal trade, ' under whatever flag they may sail,' and those payable by British vessels entering the m ers, or issuing therefrom tor the purposes of the external trade, and it prescribes the amount of anchorage toll for the lattei. The Grand Vizier then proceeds to declare that His imperial Majesty had approved the report, and had ordered that it should be put into execution, and he accordingly directs the vali to levy on British-owned vessels engaged in the internal trarac the same dues as on native vessels, and to levy on the cargoes of British vessels ' qui viennent du dehors et qui vont a I'^tranger,' the established customs duties, and an anchorage toll ol 5 piastres. The vizierial letter of the 15th January, 1861, is still more explicit on the point. The Grand Vizier commences by stating that the British Ambassador had requested ' a renewal of the orders which were sent concerning the British steamers and boats authorised, by His Majesty to ply on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates ' ; and after referring to the privileges formerly granted by Imperial firmans in 1834 and 1841, he proceeds to set out the yizierial instructions issued in 1846 at the request of the British Embassy. He cites the distinction therein laid down between the internal trade and the trade carried on ' by British vessels, whether coming loaded from abroad and entering one of those two rivers with their cargoes, or issuing therefrom to the sea laden with Ottoman produce, and bound for foreign countries, which (he states) are liable only to the treaty tariff and to the mooring toll ' on entering or leaving the Tigris or Euphrates, like all other foreign ships coining to other ports of the Ottoman Empire ; and he renews the order that those rules should be carried out. 5. The above passages would be inexplicable were the Porte's interpretation of the vizierial letters to be accepted. On the other hand, they are entirely consistent with the agreement of 1846, above mentioned, and recorded in Sir Stratford Canning's despatches of that year. 6. With respect to the argument of the Turkish Ambassador that such an agreement could not be concluded otherwise than by a treaty, it is to be observed that if such an agreement was made it is not the less valid as an international agreement because the Porte did not think fit to. give effect to it by an Imperial firman, or to insist on making it the subject of a formal treaty. 7. But even if it be conceded that the contracting parties were not ad idem in respect of the agreement, and that there was no intention on the part of the Porte to grant to British shipping in general the right ot navigating the rivers, it is contended that the vizierial letter of 1861 having been issued for the very purpose of enabling the company to put their two steamers on the Tigris and Euphrates, was intended to confer, and did confer, tliat privilege on them. The company have enjoyed that privilege ever since, with the knowledge and acquiescence of the Porte. It is true that, as stated by the Turkish Ambassador, disputes have arisen as to the substitution of new steamers for old ones, the towing of barges, and other matters; but the right of navigation of the two steamers of the company has never before been contested, which shows that the attitude of the Porte during the last twenty-two years has not been one of ' friendly tolerance,' as suggested by his Excellency, but one of acquiescence in a claim of right. On the faith of that acquiescence the company have invested a large capital in depots at convenient points on both rivers, and in establishments for working the mail, passenger and cargo services, and they have developed a large trade, to the great benefit of the country. 8. Her Majesty s Government are not called upon, therefore, to invoke, in the present case the general right of navigation claimed by them on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates. vv hatever may be the true construction of the agreement of 1846 as to the general right of navigation, Her Majesty's Government consider that the attitude of the Porte during the last twenty-two years debars them from now disputing the validity of the rights claimed and exercised by the company under the vizierial letter of 1861, and that they are entitled to insist on the status quo of the company being maintained. • JS* 8 se ?f e during the discussion of the case with the Turkish Ambassador it was pom e out to his Excellency that if Her Majesty's Government were to waive their claim to the JespectefrdmaSed 011 ' ^ hithert0 enj0yed by the COmpany 0n tlle river8 must be •i-u 9 ' ^ ke a brupt and arbitrary action of the Porte in forcibly stopping the traffic of the comnanv Otfn n0 e, and for no other cause than the desire to secure their business and profits for an man company, is marked by a singular lack of friendliness and courtesy towards Her Maiestv's ssssates s-sr •*-'*' in '» t - «• J— aSK? the note of the Turk^ P™ 'P^ as to wLther above submitted thereon • and if not tint P J e a ^ swer ed in the sense of the observations Majesty's Government b the mattt in/I t itf t aS to the ri g ht8 ^ Her returned to the Turkish note.

WE are honoured with your Lordship's commands signified in Sir Julian Pauncefote s letter of the 19th February last relating to the difficulty which had arisen between Her Majesty s Govern ment and the Sublime Porte touching the right claimed by the Turkish Government to stop the traffic of the Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company. cr t d c *.

In obedience to your Lordship's commands we have the honour to Report— That we think the note of the Turkish Ambassador may properly be answered in the sense of the observations submitted thereon. &gt; &gt; . We may add that, in the light of the fuller information now before us with reference to the extent to which navigation on the Tigris existed prior to 1846 and otherwise, we think the vizierial letter of 1846 affords more evidence in support of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe's statement of the arrangement arrived at than it appeared to us to do when we made our former report. The position of the British Government seems therefore to be somewhat stronger than we then thought, though the difficulties arising from the action of the embassy at Constantinople subsequent to 1846 still remain. With regard to the further questions submitted in Sir Julian Pauncefote's letter of the 25th March, it hardly seems necessary to make any communication at present to the Porte, as sanction only has as yet been given to the formation of an Ottoman company on condition that it does not infringe upon the rights of Messrs. Lynch's company. We submit that it would probably be expedient to postpone any action for the purpose of enforcing the claim of the company until an understanding has been arrived at upon the main question. Claims 2 and 3 appear right in principle if the company were entitled to run the barges, which, however, as appears from our former report, is not altogether free from doubt. The amounts strike us as somewhat exaggerated.^ We are not sufficiently informed of the facts t». express an opinion whether the first claim is one that can be supported. We have, &amp;c.

' tlsh veseels to navigate the Tigris and the Euphrates. I now have the ' commumctteto your Excellency the replies of Her Majesty's Government to the various arguments adduced m that note. ^ r ^ 0111 'l ei ^ es a general right to navigate the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates was COnCe 6 ^ u 6 vessels, and with regard to the vizierial letters of 1846 and ., &gt;ou aigue that if those documents had been intended to concede a general right of naviga ion, tie lefeience to the finnans of 1834 and 1841 in the vizierial letter of 1861 would ave een superfluous; that it is impossible to hold that such a right could be accorded by simple vizienal letters ; that it must necessarily have formed the subject of a treaty, the benefit of w ic , moreover, would be claimed at onre by all the other Powers entitled to most-favoured- ^ ion treatment, lhat the vizierial letters had no reference to British vessels entitled to carry e British Hag, but only to British-owned native craft which improperly earned the British flag, an ( thus escaped the payment of dues. That the object of the vizierial letters was only to record he decision &lt;&gt;t the Porte, that British-owned native craft might continue to navigate the rivers on payment of the same dues as the vessels belonging to Ottoman subjects, and that accordingly hey had continued to do so to this day, subject to such payment and without carrying the British nag. 1 hat the report of the Hotel des Monnaies referred to in the vizierial letter of 1846 was onl\ intended to lay down that native craft owned by foreigners engaged in the internal trade must pay the same dues as vessels owned by Ottoman subjects, and engaged in the same internal trade, and not to decide the question whether British vessels had the right to navigate the rivers, such a question not being within the competence of that department. That owing to the vague teims of the yizierial letters there had been confusion on the part of Her Majesty's Government V ^i en ves sels entitled to carry the British flag and British-owned native vessels, which caused them to place on those letters an interpretation as erroneous as it was inadmissible. [163—2J I28 Your Excellency added that the Tigris and Euphrates Steam Ar. tliflvfifnrft. to abandon untenable pretensions, and to restrict itselt to the pn eg 1834 Her d M 8 ajWs Government are unable, however, to agree to this statement of the facts of the case, or to the interpretation thus sought to be placed on the documents r el a mg * f In the first place, I would observe that the above-mentioned firmans have oo reteence to the steamers of the Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company but od 1 / ^ ^he two British Government steamers, which were authorised by those firmans () P ^ ^ and which had ceased to navigate that river long before the company was established. The company was created in 1862 tor the purpose ot establishing a line o s earner Mohammerah, Bussorah, and Bagdad, and, in order to prevent any opposition on the part ot tne local authorities, the British Ambassador applied to the Porte for a renewal or the oiders given o the Vali of Bagdad in a vizierial letter dated the 2nd April, 1846. That letter had beeu addressed to the vali in 184fi in execution ot an agreement arrived at between Sir Stratford Canning and the Porte, by way ot settlement of a dispute concerning the navigation of the rivers by British vessels and the payment ot dues in t ie internal trade. i , ,1 t 1 a Sir Stratford Canning, in his despatches of that date, reports that the dispute ha been settled as follows: That whereas British-owned native boats had for forty years can-it-' on the internal trade on the rivers under the British flag and without payment of dues, thev should in future pay the same dues as the native-owned boats engaged m the same trade. On the other hand, that British vessels entitled to carry the British flag would be entitled to navigate the rivers under their national colours, either for the purposes of the foreign trade or of the internal trade, subject to the payment of the local dues or treaty customs duties applicable to such trades respectively, ?ind as regards British vessels passing up the rivers beyond the customary port of entry (Bussorah), subject to the payment of an anchorage due ot 5 piastres only. • 1 i* r u The corresponding record of the agreement will no doubt be found in the archives ot the Sublime Porte. In February 1860 Messrs. Lynch and Co., being desirous of establishing a line of steamers on the rivers, applied to the Foreign Office for information as to the right of navigation, and they were informed in reply of the arrangement concluded by Sir Stratford Canning. In 1861, with a view to the carrying out of their project, the Grand Vizier, at the request of the British Ambassador, addressed a letter to the Vah of Bagdad, dated the 15th January, 1861, renewing the orders given in the vizierial letter of 1846. The same orders were renewed again in 1862, when the company formed by Messrs. Lynch put their first steamer on the Tigris, and opened their line between Bagdad and Bussorah, and that line has been in active operation ever since. Your Excellency, with a view to vindicating the recent action of the Porte, endeavours to show that the two vizierial letters of 1846 and 1861 have a totally different meaning from that which Her Majesty's Government attach to them. But the interpretation which your Excellency asks Her Majesty's Government to place on those letters appears inconsistent with the express terms of the documents. The Grand Vizier, in the letter of the 2nd April, 1846, after distinctly stating that the British Ambassador had claimed the right of British vessels to trade in both rivers on payment of the dues ' established by treaty' cites the report of the Hotel des Monnaies, to which the British Embassy had given its adhesion, and which had been submitted to and approved by the Sultan. That report declares what are the proper dues payable by vessels engaged in the internal trade, ' under whatever flag they may sail' and those payable by British vessels entering the rivers, or issuing therefrom, for the purposes of the external trade, and it prescribes the amount of anchorage toll for the latter. The Grand Vizier then proceeds to declare that His Imperial Majesty had approved the report, and had ordered that it should be put into execution ; and he accordingly directs the vali to levy on British-owned vessels engaged in the internal traffic the same dues as on native vessels, and to levy on the cargoes of British vessels ' qui viennent du dehors et qui vont a I'etranger,' the established customs duties, and an anchorage toll of 5 piastres. The vizierial letter of the 15th January, 1861, is still more explicit on the point. The Grand \izier commences by stating that the British Ambassador had requested 'a renewal oi the orders which were sent concerning the British steamers a7id boats authorised by His Majesty to ply on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates ' ; and after referring to the privileges formerly granted by Imperial firmans in 1834 and 1841, he proceeds to set out the vizierial instructions issued in 1846 at the request of the British Embassy. He cites the distinction therein laid down between the internal trade and the trade carried on ' by British vessels, whether coming loaded from abroad and entering one of those two rivers with their cargoes, or issuing therefrom to the sea laden with Ottoman produce, and bound for foreign countries,' which (he states; are liable only to the treaty tariff and to the mooring toll ' on entering or leaving the Tigris or Euphrates like all other forergn ships coming to other ports of the Ottoman Empire'; and he renews the order that those rules should be carried out. • • a ^ ()ve passages would be inexplicable were your Excellency's interpretation of the vizienal letters to be accepted. On the other hand, they are entirely consistent with the that 6 ™ 0 ? above mentioned, and recorded in Sir Stratford Canning's despatches of ft yG8»r,cludS:^ could not be eon- not the less valid as an international agreement because the Porte did nftTSfir? 8 ' r|ade « 18 to it by an Impena firman, or to insist on making it the subject of a formal toeaty ^ ^ But even if it be conceded that the contracting parties were not ./// ■ agreement, and that there was no intention on the part of the T P .

On this point it is hardly necessary for me to state that, whatever solicitude may be evinced by Parliament and by the public in the case, it will not have for its object the pecuniary advantages of a private company, but the maintenance of the just rights of a British company, legitimately acquired by agreement between the British Government and the Porte, and confirmed by long usage and acquiescence. I have only to observe in conclusion, M. I'Ambassadeur, that the abrupt and arbitrary action of the Porte in forcibly stopping the traffic of the company, without notice, and for no other cause than the desire to secure their business and profits for an Ottoman company, is marked by a singular lack of friendliness and courtesy towards Her Majesty's Government, and presents an incident unparalleled in the history of the commercial relations of this country in any part of the world.

I HAVE learned with much surprise from Her Majesty's consul at Buasorah that instructions have been received by the local authorities of that province and of Bagdad to put a stop tu the towing of barges by the Tigris and Euphrates Steam Navigation Company. I am at a loss to understand the meaning of this order, which is in direct contradiction with the assurances given to me at the Sublime Porte at the end of the month of May last. It will be in your Excellency's recollection that permission to enjoy the privilege in question during low water was granted to the above company about that time, that this permission was confirmed verbally to me by your Excellency and by his Highness the Grand Vizier, and that his Highness himself informed me that a vizierial order to this effect had been sent to the Ottoman authorities in those regions. The promise thus given and the engagement undertaken were definite and official, without any limit of time, and, on hearing of their sudden reversal, 1 accordingly brought the matter at once to your Excellency's and his Highness's notice, stating, as your Excellency will remember, that I could not admit the right of the Imperial Government to recede from their engagements of which I had in due course given official notification to Her Majesty s Government as well as to the company concerned, which had made arrangements accordingly not only for this, but for future seasons. 1 have now the honour to repeat these declarations in writing and to inform your Excellency and the Grand Vizier that I must insist upon the fulfilment of the promises made to me by the Imperial Government and upon orders being sent without delay to the Valis of Bagdad and Bussorah not to interfere \vith the towing of the barges, failing which I shall be compelled to appeal to my Government for instructions as to the course to be taken.

It formed the main con sideration by which I was with much difficulty enabled, in June 1899, to induce the Sublime Porte to send orders to the Wis of Bagdad and Bussorah directing them to authorise the towing of barges bv the company's steamers. More than one attempt has been made since then to rescind this privilege, and it was only by energetic representations that I was able to prevent it. ihese orders, moreover, have never been confirmed by Imperial irade, and I am afraid that, n l were again to raise the subject of Messrs. Lynch's privileges at the present moment, the Porte might again call in question their right to tow barges. T-here is a further consideration which should not be lost sight of. Hitherto no other foreign company has competed with the British company for the carrying trade between Bagdad and Bussorah by river, and, but for the rival Turkish company, the British company has enjoyed a virtual monopoly. It is to be feared that if attention is now called to Messrs. Lynch's position by an increase in the number of their steamers, other nations may seek to share their privileges by virtue of the most-favoured-nation clauses in their treaties. I presume that the British company would not wish us to take any step which might tend to impair their monopoly. appendix xxxii. \Extraci\ Sir JV. (J Conor to Sir T. Sanderson, July 19, 1905. MUCH as I wish I could think otherwise, I still maintain that it is not possible to obtain the third steamer for Messrs. Lynch, on the grounds of either the firman of 1834, the vizierial letters of 1842,* 1846, 1861, the letter from the Porte of 1875, or the Gran ville-Musurus negotiations of 1883 * This should be 1841. [163—2] K32 The firman of 1834 specifieB plainly that two English steamers can ply on the Euphrates, and limits the number to two ; therefore no excuse for the augmentation of the Lynch Company s fleet can be sought for in that document. Further, it has been prored and has been accepted by both Governments that the steamers mentioned in the firman were employed by the Chesney expedition, and were the property of the British Government. The vizierial letter of 1842* refers to these two steamers, and has no bearing on the question of Messrs. Lynch's fleet. The vizierial letter of 1846 does not apply to any particular rights, other than those of a general kind pertaining to all British-owned shipping on the Tigris and Euphratea The vizierial letter of 1861 deals with the payments of dues, and refers to the vizierial letter of 1842* as 'authorising the permanent station of two steamers on that river {i.e., the Euphrates), providing it were proved and established that the advantages resulting therefrom were mutual.' It was on account of the loose wording of this document that the confusion arose between the Lynch and the Chesney steamers ; neither the Porte nor the British Government appear to have noticed any distinction between the two, but both seem to have accepted the '• mutual advantage ' and 'two steamers' as applying to Messrs. Lynch. The note from the Porte of 1875 is a strong piece of evidence against any prescriptive right to augment the number of Lynch's steamers, for it consents to the replacing of one of the company's steamers by another on the definite understanding that the actual number of steam ships plying on the river shall not be increased. In f883, when the Turkish Government attempted to debar the Lynch Company from plying on the Tigris by quoting the firman of 1834, which only mentioned the Euphrates as the river navigable by the two British steamers, Lord Granville, in his communication to Musurus Pasha, insisted on the maintenance of the status quo of the company on the River Tigris, i.e., the right to navigate that liver with two steamers. It will therefore be seen that in every document I have mentioned (excepting the vizierial letter of 1842 [sic. Query 1846], which applies only to British shipping in general, and not to British steamers in particular) the number of British steamers navigating the Euphrates and Tigris for trading purposes has been limited to two; hence it would be difficult to agree with Mr. Lynch when he says,' The endeavour to limit the number to two is of quite modern origin.' Particularly in view of the fact that in 18 &lt;3 Messrs. Lynch complained that thev were prevented from running their steam-launch, and only with great difficulty obtained permission from the Porte to run the steam-launch with the mails, as well as the two steamers carrying cargo. Taking the whole of these facts into consideration, I must say that I cannot see how it is possible to apply to the Porte for permission for a third steamer on the ground of ' prescriptive right. It has never been suggested by the British Government that such a right exists, and in a note verhale to the Porte of the 12th January, 1883, the British Embassy stated that Messrs. Lvnch nad no intention of running a third steamer. APPENDIX XXXIII. Tramlation of a Letter dated the VMh March, 1823,/rom His /Ar . ,. , s Political Agent at Bussorah. (Alter compliments.)

THE following notice, signed by the Assistant Vali of Bagdad on behalf of the vali, was published in the ' Nawadir newspaper at Bagdad on the 10th January :— ' The right to navigate the Tigris and Euphrates is granted to Turkish subjects only; it is not enjoyed by any foreigners except Messrs. Lynch and Co., who have three steamers plying under certain conditions. ' It is understood that some sailing-vessels belonging to Persians are running on both rivers ; but as the prohibition (soil., of foreign vessels) includes all steamers and sailing-vessels, no (foreign) steamer or sailing-vessel will be allowed to enter the said rivers from the date of this notice. ' As regards steamers or sailing-vessels which may have entered before this date, a period of three months from this date is allowed them to finish their operations and leave. ' Any steamer which may hereafter enter from the Persian Gulf, and any steamer or sailing- vessel which is already on the Tigris or Euphrates and fails to leave within three months, will be confiscated.' It does not appear that the notice is aimed at, or will affect any British interest.
