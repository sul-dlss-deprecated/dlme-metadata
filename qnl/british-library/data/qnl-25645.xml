I quote here an extract from (page 12) Captain Clayton’s report on his Mission to the Idrisi in July 1919, which speaks for itself. fT In connection with political affairs I venture to think 'that it will be a very great pity if the appointment of 'Captain 11. Fa zluce; in, is not prolonged for so long ” as we intend to interest ourselves in As ir, provided he 'is willing to stay. If there had been any one who had 'both an opportunity of seeing his work and the right to 'report upon it, more would have undoubtedly been heard 'of it, I know the suregon of one of A.M.Ships was most 'enthusiastic, after landing for a visit of inspection, 'over the professional work he had done in the face of 'great difficulties, including, in early days, the impro- 'visation of buildings and appliances and the training of 'his assistants* I believd there can be no doubt as to 'the excellent political results of his stay there. He 'combines His Excellency The High Commissioner, Bamleh, Alexandria'combines a strong Indian with a strong British patriotism. He is a devout Moslem &lt; no has a great resoeet for the 'Idrisi, which fret,.while I doubt whether it leads to any 'bias that matters in his reports, makes for excellent re flations between them. He is xertainly largely the cause of 'the Idrisi’s present pro-British tendencies. ’■Captain Fazluddin is likely to act as a spur to the 'Icrisi and Sayed Mustafa in their reforming intentions. At 'present, he says, they justify shortcomings by saying 'As 'yet we are only beginning'; while the Idrisi with good 'reason laments hr it of capable assistants, and aptly 'describes one of the two chief ministers with the words: 'l 1 hat ox: How can he help me V hat does he know of the 'world ? 'With Captain Faziuddin on the spot to watch things ' and apply a certain amount of stimulus, and with Xamaran 'for Captain Fazluddin himself to re nort to and keep in 'touch with, to &gt;revent his going stale under the influence 'of a very trying climate, and lonely and primitive 'conditions, there should be a good chance of the Idfisi -continuing to tread in the good path which he at present 'seems inclined to follow.' Captain Fasluddin’s legitimate work is purely medical but his political work and reports have been of the great- i % esfc assistance and have on occasion met with special com mendation from Lord mllenby. I consider that he should receive some remuneration for this branch of his activities and accordingly recommend the grant to him of a monthly allowance of Hs.lOO/- with retrospective effect from 1st April 1919.U Can tain iazluddin has under his orders S compounders ° f Vh0m one 18 lst and two are End grade. Jhej all draw pay at «8.70/- per mensem. She 1st grade compounder is an experienced maa and 1 consider his pay should be larger than that of his less experienced colleagues.

As regards the technical points raised in the Political Kesident’s letter of ,nd ultimo : (a) I consider these pension contribution® are a fair charge against the British exchequer.

Sir, In Mr Heath*s letter No.3594 of 9th February 1918, a copy of which was sent to me under your endorsement dated 3rd March 1918, It ms intimated that the British Exchequer accepted the isharge ©n account of the appointment of Lieutenant Nasiruddin Ahmed as Liaison Officer to the Idrisi, 2 * There are however three technical questions in connection with this appointment on which I have the honour to request information. ^ a ) Prior to his transfer to the present post under the Foreign ofiice Lieutenant Nasiruddin held an appointment paid from the Indian Revenues. His position is consequently W analogous to tnat of Lt-Colonel H.E.tTacob, and he is apparently subject to the conditions governing the appointment of Officers to 'Foreign Service' as laid down in chapter 39 of the Indian Civil Service Regulations. I presume therefore that British Exchequer will pay pension contributions to the Indian Revenues on behalf of Lieutenant Nasiruddin. ( b ) whether his leave will be regulated by the Rules obtaining in Egypt or by the Indian Civil Service Regulations. A ruling on this point is desirable. (°) Whether Lieutenant Nasirudain should be granted travelling allowance and if so, at what rates. He has been granted a consolidated salary of Re.600 a month and a horse. He asks - or travelling allowance at special •ates (see a copy of his letter enclosed), as an officer in 'Foreign Service' he would /apparently( 2 ) apparently be entitled to travelling allowance either according to rules obtaining in ilgypt or the Indian Civil Service regulations.

It will be seen from Sir R.

INDIA OFFICE 12th December 1917 Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th November 1917, No. 218243/1/44, regarding the proposed grant of assistance to Saiyid Idrisi of Asir and other friendly Sheikhs of Southern Arabia. The circumstances in which a subsidy to the Idrisi of £7000 per mensem was conditionally sanctioned by the Government of India in July 1916 are fully explained in * the marginally noted telegrams, copies of which were Dm Resident Aden, liol 226 A.P. 9th July 1916. ) communicated to your ' 7ic«roy 12th July 1916. v i r, ) Department at the time. m Resident Aden, No. 227 A.P. 15th July 1916.

This point is brought out in the first sentence of the Secretary of State’s telegram of the 14th July * 1916, which furnished the Government of India with their authority for preceding witn the proposal. Reference is 'Opy communicated to «’or‘='ign Office _25th July 1916. / he Secretary, FOREIGN OFFICE. also invited to my letter of the 19th April 1917, No.P.1161 Cara was taken, at all stages of the correspondence, to keep the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs fully and a 9&lt; X and promptly informed of what was going forward. Moreover his concurrence in the view that the promised subsidy was properly chargeable to Imperial revenues was formally asked in Sir A. Hirtzel's letter of 26th October 1916, and the approval of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury was accorded in Sir R. Chalraer's letter of 20th Rebruarv iqi? It is plain from the correspondence that the present proposals are supported by the High Commissioner for Egypt ana oy the Resident, Aden, strictly on their merits; and they appear to have received the approval of the Middle last Committee on the same ground, and without special reference to any provisional promise made to the Idrisi in 1916. In the circumstances the Secretary of State regrets that he is not prepared to reopen the question of the incidence of the expenditure involved. With regard to the future, I am to observe that, as the Government of India are no longer responsible for the political or military control of the Aden region, the warning proposed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury in the 3rd paragraph of Sir R. Chalmers’s letter of the 4th November 1917, No. 34639, would not appear to be needed so far at least as Southern Arabian affairs are concerned. I have etc., (Signed) J.E.

' '• A My Lord:- I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty 7 s Treasury Sir VJ. Langley’s letter of the 3th instant (No.'h.20396/17) and Sir Maurice de Bunsen’s letter of the 22nd ultimo (M.15491/17) relative to the proposed grant to Said Mustapha el Idrisi and to certain other items of expenditure arising out of negotiations with the Arab tribes between the Hedjaz and Aden. My Lords understand that the Secretary of State for India in Council contends that the whole of this expend iture should be regarded as part of the ’’extraordinary 7 ’ military expenditure on the war with Turkey, which, under the terms of the Parliamentary Resolutions of November 1914, is chargeable in its entirety to the British Exchequer. Their Lordships are prepared to accept this view so far as concerns expenditure incurred since the beginning of the revolt in the Hedjaz, more especially as Ihey under stand that the Government of India are most anxious, for political reasons, to avoid admioting as a cnarge a&amp;ainot Indian funds any expenditure connected with that revolt. Both the grant of land to Sain Mustcupnc,, rTo C4, go so or £3 000 and the subsidies to the Hashid-wa-Baxil would appear therefore to he fairly chargeable in their entirety against The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.against Imperial funds; and My Lords sanction the necessary action for the conveyance of the proposed vift to the former. But the gii o of rifles to the Idrisi Saiyid appear to date from as far hack as March 1915; and My Lords see considerable lifficulty in attributing its cost to extra ordinary expenditure directly connected with the war against Turney, rather than to the ordinary political expenditure borne wholly by India in virtue of her par amount interest in uden, - towards the occupation of which a separate subsidy is given. I am accordingly to suggest, as a convenient basis for settlement, that the expenditure for this purpose up to the date of the Hedjaz Bevolt (say 21st June 1916) shall be divided equally between Indian and Imperial funds (so far as it is not recoverable from the Idrisi), and only thereafter be charged wholly against the Imperial Exchequer. My Lords consider that these expenses should be charged against the Vote of Credit and accounted for b} the Foreign Office in the same way as the subsidies to the Shereef and other similar outlays for political purposes connected with the war. They will await the full statement of accounts promised by the Secretary of State. I am, etc., (Signed) Robert ChalmersFile 15(c), Supplement to File 15(c) of Vol. II. of Prints.

It would seem, however, that tins arrangement, which is in accordance with the Welby Dommission’s recommendations, and which would be more favourable to India than that now proposed by us, has been superseded for the period of war by resolution cited above. W e should be glad to receive early instructions in the matter. Sir, F. 5722/15 India Office to Treasury. India Office, 20th January 1916. i cim directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to forward, for the consideration of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, Dated 27th October 1915. a C0 Py a telegram 1 from the Govern ment of India regarding the incidence of cost oi: troops from the Indian establishment employed in Oman and Persia during the Avar. With reference to the concluding portion of the telegram Mr. Chamberlain is inclined to think that it is impossible to forecast with accuracy at the present stage whether a division of the charges on the basis of the Resolution 2 n , . of 26th November 1914 2 would or opv cue use would not be less favourable to the revenues of India (and more favourable to Imperial revenues) than a division in accordance with the pre-war arrangements, under which India bore the full cost of the troops employed in Oman, and was normally liable for half of the cost of any troops employed in Persia otherwise than in the suppression of the arms traffic. The effect from this point of view of the alteration of system would depend on the realised proportion of “ ordinary ” to “ extraordinary ” expenditure, the latter increasing with the expensiveness of the operations in which the troops are engaged. The troops at Bushire (one battalion of infantry and details), for example, and those at Chahbar (about 100 strong), Jask (about 200 strong), and Muscat (about 760 strong), are, and are likely to remain immobile, so that the extraordinary expenditure on them will probably be small, whereas the troops in Seistan (about 600 infantry and 350 cavalry) are intended to be highly mobile. Mr. Chamberlain is of opinion, however, that a division of the charges in accordance with the Resolution of 26th November 1914, is appropriate in itself. This method of division has now been applied to the Indian in France, Egypt, Gallipoli, and East Africa; to the additional Indian regiment sent since the commencement of the war toMauritius ; and to the large body of regular British troops sent to Europe from India in exchange for Territorials. In a war extending to three continents which has called up the military resources of every part of the Empire,, the presumption must be that any Indian troops engaged in operations beyond the external frontiers of India, or stationed in regions where such operations are in progress, come under the Resolution. Mr. Chamberlain assumes, therefore, that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will agree with him that the Resolution should be applied to the troops from the Indian establishment employed in Persia and Oman since the outbreak of the war. He will be glad to learn that this assumption is correct. ! The Secretary, Treasury. I am, &amp;c., T. \V. Mold F.it ness 9 Treasury to India Office. f No. 6128.

I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury your letter of the 20th January last (F. 5722/15) regarding the incidence of cost of troops from the Indian establishment employed in Oman and Persia during the war. I am to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, copy of correspondence between this Department and the War Office on the subject; and I ajn to express the hope that Mr. Secretary Chamberlain will accede to the suggestion of the Army Council that the Government of India should bear the whole charges of these troops for the time being, until the question of the ultimate, incidence of the expenditure can be dealt with. If, however, the Secretary of State feels unable to accept this proposal, My Lords are of opinion that, as -an alternative, the same basis should be adopted for dealing with troops in Persia as has been suggested in the case of Aden by Treasury letter of the 17th ultimo (507/16), the whole cost of troops in Oman remaining as a charge upon Indian Funds, I am, &amp;c., lire Under Secretary of State Robert Chalmers. for India.

No. 1909/16 of the 19th ultimo, regarding the incidence of cost of the troops from the Indian Establishment employed in Oman and Persia during the Avar. The Council agree Avith Their Lordships that, having regard to the substantial interest of India in Persia'and Oman, there is no reason why the Imperial Government should bear the same share of the expenditure as in, the case of the operations in France, and while the Council are unaware of the grounds on which the Treasury agreed to share equally between Imperial and Indian revenues the whole cost of the Indian troops employed in Southern Persia in 1911 and thereafter, they do not think that those grounds should necessarily determine t he incidence of cost under the totally different circumstances now prevailing. The Council consider that the case is one Avhich should lie dealt with by the transfer of a round sum based on estimate only, as suggested in the case of Aden in AVar Office letter 0161/3340 A. (F. 1 ) of 6 th January 1916, and approved in Treasury letter 507 of 17th February 1916. Holding this view, they consider that efforts should be made to dispense Avith detailed accounting between the Indian Government and the War Office at a time of pressure like the present; and, as the whole sum involved is not large in proportion to other military expenditure, theA r consider that the Government of India might reasonably lie expected to bear the whole charges of these troops, currently, until such time as the question of the ultimate incidence of the expenditure can be dealt with.

As regards Hashid and Bakil, we concur in Resident at Aden’s telegram 227 A.P., dated 15th July, and are instructing him to proceed accordingly. We deprecate, however, any attack by these tribes on Sanaa so long as Imam does not definitely join Turks. It is obviously undesirable to hustle him from present neutral attitude into active hostility even for sake of attacking Turks at Sanaa. We are also asking Resident to communicate again with Imam in sense indicated, but to avoid mention of territorial claims at present. From Political Resident, Aden, 22nd July 1916. (Addressed to Foreign Office, Simla ; repeated to Secretary of State for India ; Bombay and Cairo.) [P 2911] 228 A.P. With reference to your telegram No. 841 W. dated 20th July, following telegram sent to Turton : — “ Government have approved Idrisi’s proposal to enlist services of Hashid Bakil. A subsidy of 7,000b per month is available as soon as agree ment between Idrisi and above tribes is completed. You may now, on my behalf, ask Idrisi to complete arrangements with Hashid Bakil. You are to impress on Idrisi that agreement is to be subject to two following con ditions : first, the Hashid Bakil are not to be actually employed in any way except under my orders ; and secondly, neither they nor Idrisi should attack Imam unless he refuses to throw in his lot with us and openly joins the Turks.” A signed copy of agreement when completed should be sent to me. CAmiuJr m t 2?. m .jt[P 2700] becret. Your telegram of 9th July. Aden. As regards Idrisi we agree with Resident that he should be trusted and supported liberally with arms and ammunition. His alliance has been of some military and very considerable political value to us and he has carried out his engagements so far as his resources admitted, and has now given practical proof of beino- in earnest by seizure of Kunfida, vide Cairo’s telegram oh 9 th July. As regards Idrisi’s territorial ambitions it would be premature at present to invite suggestions from him or consider matter in detail. In the meantime we have warned Idrisi that he must confine himself to action against Turks and avoid collision with other Arab chiefs as far as possible and he appears to be taking warning to heart. How far he has already weaned Haskid-Wa-Bakil away from Imam is not clear, but if this is a fait accompli we should accept it and assist Idrisi with money and munitions required for their employment on condition that they are employed against Turks not against Imam unless he definitely sides with Turks. As regards Imam there appears to be no likelihood at present of his coming off the fence on our side. If, however, in reply to Resident’s letter he shows disposition to do so we should certainly give him assurance of full subsidies equal to those granted by Turks; but should make no territorial promises. We deprecate any attempts at present to lay down post helium spheres whether for ourselves, Imam, or Idrisi. If we succeed we shall be in a strong position to adjudicate as may be expedient when the time comes. We fully appreciate political advantages of forward move on our own part from Aden, but military considerations must be paramount. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreign Department, \4:th July Hdib. {Repeated to Resident, Aden.) Foreign Secret. Your telegram dated 12th July and Resident, Adens, 8 th July. Immediate object is to contain Turkish troops in southern Yemen. Resident might advise Idrisi to come to terms at ogpe with Hashid and Bakil and ascertain what money is required. No movement to be made by them except on your orders. I suggest he might also communicate again with Imam and endeavour to induce him to attack Turks by offer of full subsidies. If Idrisi or Imam raise territorial claims they should be told that His Majesty’s Government cannot consider them until after the war. Imam may, if necessary, be given to understand that no claims east of oui existing frontier or in neighbourhood of Sheikh Said will be lecognised. luiisi should undertake that neither he nor tribes above mentioned will attack Imam unless latter now refuses our overtures and openly joins Turks. Every effort will be made to supply Idrisi with munitions.[P 2700] I v 18695. I. 480. 1000.—4/: From Resident, Aden, 9th Jiilf/ ]flT?C (Repeated to Foreign, Simla; High Commissioner, Cairo ; Bombay Political.) m A.P. _ 8th July. Referring to your telegram of 7th July. Following » is my appreciation of local political situation which I submit in full as 1 am liana mg over to General Stewart on Tuesday. Mrisi is a remarkable personality and all available evidence indicates him to be reliable. Though he would resent intrusion of Sherif into 4sir he assured Turton that if Sherif forestalled him at Kunfida or Abha before he could arrange to attack them he would avoid conflict with him depending- on our treaty of promise to adjudicate after expulsion of Turks ’ Turton absolutely convinced of his loyalty, and had no intention of conveying impression that he thought Idrisi likely to attack Sherif—on the contrary he is willing to help him. Under our treaty obligation we have undertaken to provide idrisi with munitions of war. It would be unjust to incite him to attack Turks unless we are prepared to fulfil our obligation with regard to guns as well as rifles. It is unnecessary to ask for guarantees because by means of blockade we could reduce him to terms in a short time, moreover, there is every reason to believe that he is loyal, and his past actions and present interests and sentiments confirm this. The chief reason he will have nothing to do with Imam is that latter broke faith with him in 1910. Having now written friendly letter to Sherif he will himself keep faith. Chief London wiies that Italian ammunition is not available but some 15-pounders and 5-inch howitzers may be forthcoming from Egypt, These may be useful and I have instituted enquiries at Jezan but now mountain guns and ammunition are primary requisite. Our chief endeavour should now be to supply him with sufficient guns and ammunition to permit of successful action against lurks. As regards Imam less is known but so far he has given the Turks little military assistance. Although he is personally subject to Turks his tribesmen for most part despise him and hate the Turks and he would find difficulty in getting large numbers to fight for him except in a popular cause. According to late Arab reports, lurks are not assured of his loyalty to them. Idrisi distrusts and dislikes him and no co-operation is likely, but Idrisi will not attack him unless we give the order or in self-defence. Idrisi has left sufficient troops on his southern border to act on defensive. Idrisi will later on wish to attack Loheya, but at present he does not wish to stir up Imam. The latter has not sent large bodies of troops to help the Turks against Aden, but only a few thousand. He has made a threat against Hadramaut, but these have now been withdrawn. The Abdali Sultan has written friendly letters to Imam imploring him to join the rest of Arabs against Turks, and I have written to similar effect. If he is once assured Turkish cause is bad he will perhaps turn against them if he could raise tribes. Under the circumstances it appears to be the wise course to let Imam remain undisturbed until he has made up his mind. But it would be well to instruct Idrisi to come to definite terms with Hashid and Bakil who are already independent of Imam and friendly to Idrisi, and inform us what financial assistance will be required from us. No movement to be made except on our order. What appears essential is that we should know what is to be Arab status after ejectment of Turks. What territory is going to be adjudicated to Idrisi who lias been loyal throughout and to Imam who at present has troops fighting against us ? It is not possible to offer inducement of territorial acquisition to Imam to turn against Turks, because we have not made up our minds what is to be Tdrisi’s reward for faithful service. It seems possible that latter’s expectations reach from Kunfida south ward to and including Bodeidah, and probably further south to include Zaraniks, some of wTiom have always been his adherents. I can give no hint of his expectations eastward. Our duties as adjudicators under our Treaty are likely to leave us friends with neither party if we permit undue expectations to grow up, but in any case Imam’s prospects are deservedly poor, and it is difficult to suggest what inducements can be offered to secure his offensive against Turks, unless it be an annual income equalling 1,200k he now receives from them. By consolidating authority of Idrisi on western coast, and of Kaiti Sultan of Mokalla, on south coast of Arabia, we may hope to preserve peace and security of country against outside aggression and internal unrest, especially if w r e are prepared ourselves to take over a Protectorate of South West corner on line of Aden-Taiz-Hodeidah. But if we do not take some action, Imam, whether he joins us or not, wall expect to take over country including Lahej, now politically occupied by Turks and Sheikh Said. In short, we may keep Imam temporarily neutral but not permanently friendly except at a price which we may well hesitate to pay, but we may reduce him eventually to economic dependence by intermediary control of his trade routes to coast both west and south.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100046690945.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/609/1</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100046690945.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/609/1</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>P 3280/1916 Pt 1 'Arabia: [Asir]: Financial and Other Assistance to the Idrissi [etc.] Appointment of a Liaison-Medical Officer (Capt Fazuluddin)'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1916/1922</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-05-05T11:27:37</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 item (229 folios)</extent><extent>Condition: large pieces are missing from the edge of folio 278, including some of the text of the document.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file mostly consists of correspondence relating to the Idrisi [Idrissi] Sayid of Asir in Southern Arabia.
