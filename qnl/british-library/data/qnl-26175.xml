Sir Bernard Reilly in his telegram of the 29th November raised the question whether Sanctions should be applied Kamaran. The Government of India, in ce//. their telegram of 3rd December, naturally display— responsibility in the matter as Kamaran is not British territory at all, and its administration as part of the Aden settlement is on quite an irregular basis. The Foreign Office, whe-n copies of the telegram were sent ~U&gt; them, state# that they do not consider Sanctions should be applied, but a close watch should be kept on imports from Italian territories. It js understood from the colonial Office by telephone that they concur in the Foreign Office letter. They agree that as a matter of convenience, since the original telegrams were addressed to this Office, we should issue the reply, though it is a moot point whether this is properly a matter affecting the civil administration of Aden. Draft telegram to the Government of India, repeated to Aden, is submitted. ^ ^ tvufc t&amp;c.o. ’’ T /I p '9^ -1— ■■1» iifthor communication abject please quote &amp; No - J 8858/5499/1 and address— not to any person by name but to— Foreign Office. “ The Under-Secrotary of State,” S.W. 1. Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. 11th Deceinber, 1935. Sir I am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to acimowledge the receipt of India Office letters Nos.P.Z«8598 and 8700/1935 of the 2nd and 4th December, in which the question is raised whether the measures taken under Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations in regard to the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia shall be applied to Kamaran Island. 2. Apart from any considerations as to the legal status of the Island for the purposes of the present dispute, the Secretary of State considers that it would be inopportune on grounds of policy for the measures in question to be applied to Kamaran. He would suggest, however, that the imports of grain and other articles from Italian possessions should be carefully watched. 3. A copy of this letter is being addressed to the Colonial Office. I am.

SECRET. 0 Enclosure in Colonial Office Covering Letter Dated 2?th July, 1934, No.37926/34- Colonial Office, Downing Street, 24th July, 1934- Sir, I have the honour to refer to my secret despatch 2 of the 30th April regarding the provision of additional equipment for the police stationed on the Islands of Perim and Kamaran, in the last paragraph of which you were promised a separate despatch on the subject of the special status of Kamaran. 2. In your despatch No. C. 172 of the 24th March, 1933, to the Government of India the statement is made that the responsibility for the defence of the Islands of Perim and Kamaran against an enemy Power in war time would remain with the Officer Commanding, British Forces in Aden; and a similar statement is contained in paragraph 4(a) of the letter from the Officer Commanding British Forces in Aden, dated 18th November, 1933, a copy of which was enclosed with your despatch of the 22nd November, 1933- While this statement is true of Perim, it is not applicable to Kamaran. As you are aware, the Island of Kamaran comes within the scope of Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne under the provisions of which its future is left to be settled ’*by the parties concerned'’. Kamaran is, therefore, not a British possession and is only administered by His ivlajesty’s Government, its status being left under the Treaty of Lausanne THE RESIDENT AT ADEN. for/for settlement after consultation between the interested Powers. His Majesty’s Government regard it, however, as a vital Imperial interest that no European Power should establish itself on Kamaran Island and that the island should not fall into the hands of an unfriendly Arab ruler. 3» In these circumstances His Majesty^ Government, while they consider themselves entitled to take such steps as can be shown to be necessary to maintain the status quo on the island, would be unable to sanction such measures as the erection of fortifications or other permanent works, since such measures would be likely to convey the impression that His Majesty* s Government intended to occupy the island permanently and to treat it in fact as a British possession. The same not objection woulc^ however, apply to less formidable precautions, of a non-permanent nature, against attack, such as the strengthening of the garrison, the issue to it of additional arms or the stationing at the island of a warship or service aircraft. In view, nevertheless, of the suspicious attitude of the Italian Government in regard to any action by His Majesty*s Government at Kamaran, the carrying out of even such measures as those referred to in the previous sentence would require careful handling and should not, save in circumstances of great emergency, be taken without reference to His I. ajesty*s Government. The instructions in the previous sentence do not of course apply to normal visits to Kamaran by His Majesty*s sloops and service aircraft. 4* It does not, in point of fact, appear that Kamaran is in the least likely to be the object of organised attack. There is little reason to suppose that King Ibn Saud or the King of the Yemen would seek to challenge the position of His/3 i V. A. % ' m &amp; His Majesty's Government on the island. The Italian Government are committed to the acceptance of the status quo ; and there is small danger of a threat from any other power. It would appear therefore that the principal, if not the only, risk is that of sporadic attacks from the mainland 'by tribesmen from the Arabian coast, in the event of which the permissible defensive measures referred to in the preceding paragraph should be adequate. 5* In the light of the special circumstances to which I have referred above you will no doubt appreciate the importance of dealing separately with all questions relating to the island of Kamaran, and of ensuring that any measures which it may be necessary to take in connection with the island should be quite distinct from any measures taken in connection with British possessions such as Perira. I shall be grateful if this distinction may be clearly borne in mind, and if any necessary instructions may be given to secure that the principles enunciated in this despatch are not inadvertently infringed. In so far as may be possible, any proposals affecting Karaaran should be dealt with in separate correspondence. I have, etc., Sgd. P. CUITLIFFE-LI8TER.Previous File.
