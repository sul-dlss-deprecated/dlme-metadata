Secret. Trans-Persian Railway. It is understood that the British group of the Societe d’Etudes are not prepared to go on unless His Majesty’s Government give more decided support than they have yet given. The moment is therefore critical, since it is thus in the power of His Majesty’s Government to wreck the scheme for the time being. We have to consider, then, whether the scheme is one with which it is desirable to go on, regard being had to all the interests involved. The official view of the Secretary of State for India was stated in our letter of 6th April 1911, in which British participation was justified on the ground that it might be argued that the geographical isolation of India was necessarily doomed, “ and that it behoves those who are responsible for her “ interests to be foremost in the race for concessions, so as to ensure that such “ at least as may be strategically and politically essential to her security shall be in her own hands. One or more of these concessions wnuld be for railway ‘ lines, which, though their immediate purpose would be different, might, “ without disadvantage, form connecting links in a Trans-Persian railway.’’ Lord Morley had already concurred in the Government of India’s opinion that there was no prospect of such a railway being a commercial success, and it is evident from the whole tone of the letter that the Trans-Persian railway as such was disliked here, but that means were being sought of enabling the Foreign Office to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Russian Government. It was thought that there was no harm in accepting in principle a scheme which was certain to prove impracticable. The question is should we now go beyond that attitude ? There can be no doubt that neither the Government of India, nor the India Office, nor the Foreign Office, nor any responsible business man would ever have spontaneously proposed a Trans-Persian railway for the sake of through connexion with Europe. There can be very little doubt that nobody likes the proposal, and that everybody would gladly see it dropped. But we are implicated in it for two reasons. (1) From a desire to please the Russian Government, and especially the Emperor, who is understood to press it strongly. (2) From an apprehension that if we do not agree to it now, when we can more or less make our own terms, it may some day be forced upon us by others on terms that may be very unfavourable. Now, there are obvious limits beyond which the first of these reasons cannot be pressed. “ Why,” it was asked in India Office letter of 6th April 1911, “ why should “ India sacrifice all the strategical advantages of her geographical isolation “ in order to encourage a scheme which, whatever prospect of profit it may offer to her commercial rival, offers none to herself ? ” The answer, if there is one, lies, from the Indian point of view, in the second reason, which therefore deserves closer examination than it has yet received. I he argument is this. Railway construction in Persia is inevitable. Persia cannot be “ sterilised ” as the India Office wished (letter of 23rd December 1909)—and either Russia or some other Power will sooner or later build railways in the direction of India, the alignment of, or rates charged on, which may be very inconvenient. The only safe course, therefore, is to make the best terms we can now, while Russia is friendly. From their letters of 17th December 1909 and 19th January 1910 it would appear that this is the Foreign Office view^. But since the latter date (which was prior to the formal Russian proposal), no reasoned statement of their views has been received. Reserving for further consideration later the question whether through railway connection is inevitable, the points to be examined are the supposed commercial and strategical (including political) disadvantages of standing aloof.The disadvantages of standing aloof. * See for example memorandum by Indian Director-General of Commercial Intelligence, paragraph 3, memorandum by President of Indian Railway Board, paragraphs 3-8, report of Government of India’s Committee, paragraph 3. Now, as regards the former, our only weapon against hostile tariffs is a friendly international agreement. But the Board of Trade are never tired of telling us that such agreements are of little real use because they do not touch—and nothing can touch—the indirect methods by which the rival country can bountify its own trade. What we stand to lose, then, by the absence of an agreement on the subject of rates is apparently nothing vital. But again none of the British or commercial authorities who have discussed the project have recommended it on commercial grounds. Quite the contrary : all have shown that neither as regards through, nor as regards local, traffic would it benefit India, whose trade with Persia—all are agreed — depends on railways running inland from the sea-board.* If we have these, we may be able to compete in north-west and north Persia with Russian goods imported by rail via Astara, or with German goods imported by rail via Khanikin. If we have not, a Trans-Persian railway with its long run through the wilderness from Karachi will not enable us to do so. Again, therefore, what we stand to lose by the absence of such a railway is apparently nothing vital. The strategical and political dangers are perhaps more real. The danger points to India are presumably Kerman, Robat, and some port on the open sea between Bunder Abbas (which it is assumed that we can seal up with our ships) and Gwetter on the frontier of British Baluchistan ; and what w T e have to fear is that some other Power, i.e., either Russia or Germany, will build a line to one or other of those points, establish her political influence along it, and when the time comes deposit an army corps at the end of it. Take Russia first. So long as the entente exists Russia cannot, except by agreement with us, get beyond the limits of her own sphere, i.e., Yezd ; but the Trans- Persian Railway is going there in any case. If, however, the entente has ceased to exist, Russia is actually or potentially hostile. But in either case, the mere fact that the Trans-Persian Railway was in existence would not prevent her from building a line to Kerman, and continuing it to Robat if it were essential to her plan of campaign to do so ; and in either case, and whether the Trans-Persian line were in existence or not, our only safeguard would apparently be a line of our own from Bunder Abbas to Kerman and such force as we might be able to maintain on it. While as regards a line to the sea at, say, Chahbar, its construction by a potentially hostile Russia would, if Lord Lansdowne’s declaration is maintained, be a casus belli, nor would the existence of the Trans-Persian Railway as such prevent the case from arising. Of Germany ihe same appears to be true, except that it might be argued that the existence of a Trans-Persian Railw r ay might even increase the danger because of the standing temptation which, as pointed out below, it would afford of making a short circuit by an extension from Khanikin to Ispahan and Yezd. Whether there is any real military danger to India to be apprehended from Germany (or Turkey), I do not venture to discuss. If there is, then against Germany, as against Russia, the safeguard lies not in a Trans-Persian railway but in the possession of British railway concessions in the British sphere—Bunder Abbas-Kerman for construction, and Bunder Abbas-Gwettur, and possibly Chahbar-Kerman and Kerman-Robat, for blocking purposes. Is a Trans-Persian Railway inevitable ? It is submitted, therefore, that if those concessions are obtained—and it is assumed that it is not beyond the power of British diplomacy to obtain them—there is no additional danger, commercial or strategical, involved in standing out now from the Trans-Persian project, even if it can be built without us and is inevitable. But is it inevitable ? It has been assumed by very high authorities that it is, and a different opinion can only be expressed with great diffidence. There seem, how r ever, to be some considerations pointing in another direction. Presumably a railway is only inevitable if it is certain that it will pay, or if it is necessary to the parties concerned for commercial, strategical, or political reasons. The3 parties concerned are India, Persia, Russia, and Germany. That the through line will either pay India, or is necessary commercially to her in self-defence or as an outlet for her goods, the overwhelming mass of authority denies, as has already been observed, and the British group have tSir W. E. Garstin’s letter of 9th sta ^ e(1 ^ iat onl y the branch lines can December 1912. make the project profitable.! Persia needs railways, but it is difficult to see wdiat commercial or financial advantage she will derive from the establishment of through railway connexion with Europe across her territory, since ex hypolhesi that connexion will not pay India. What will benefit her enormously is the extension of the Russian system, or of the Bagdad hailway, to Tehran and Ispahan j but she has nothing to gain by their extension east of Yezd. Similarly she will benefit greatly by British railways from the Gulf, but it does not appear that there will be any such additional gain by the formation of a through connexion as would make it financially profitable on its own account or in any sense commercially necessary to her. As regards Russia, if our authorities are correct, and as through connexion \\ ill not pay India, it is difficult tc see how it can pay Russia, and it is noteworthy that even the Russian promoters ask for a guarantee. What will pay Russia, and is in fact necessary to her, is the extension of her system throughout her sphere, not a through railway for its own sake. The case of Germany is substantially the same, but it seems probable that a through German line is less unlikely to pay than the Russian scheme. An extension of the Bagdad RaiRvay from Khanikiniua Ispahan and Yezd is both considerably shorter, and, being German, likely to be more efficient. There is, no doubt, the disadvantage of break of bulk at the Bosphorus; but if our authorities aie correct in assuming that there will be no appreciable through traffic in goods, that will not be a prohibitive obstacle, while for passengers it will present no difficulty, since on a journey of that duration there -would probably be one change of train in any case. The Russian promoters have expressed a fear of the contingency of a German extension such as that indicated above, but it is not known whether our own experts have ever &gt;- studied the problem from the German point of view ; but on the assumption that such a through line will pay and will indeed be inevitable, the Russian drans-Rersian scheme will obviously not only not hinder it but will be ruined by it, since the Germans can and will effect a short circuit. And if this view is correct our policy now should be to negotiate with Germany, not with Russia, for a Trans-Persian railway —a proposal which is not at present before us. To whom, then, is a through line necessary for strategical or political reasons ? Certainly not to India, who, it is universally admitted, stands only to lose in those respects. As regards Persia, there is room for difference of opinion as to whether she will gain or lose politically by the construction of such a line. Railways in general, no doubt, conduce to the maintenance of order ; but railways themselves cannot be constructed and worked unless order is maintained, and there is something of a circle here. Again, it is open to question whether the construction and working of railways by foreigners conduces to independence ; though, so far as such railways are international, scope is afforded to an oriental Government for its favourite device of playing off one Power against another, and so maintaining its own uneasy balance. But if the case be put at its highest it can hardly be maintained that a Trans-Persian railway in particular is so necessary to Persia politically and strategically that it is bound to be constructed. When we come to Russia and Germany we are almost bound to assume that if it is for political and military reasons necessary to either of them it can only be for offensive purposes against India; and the measure of their necessity is the measure oi ours to prevent and not facilitate those purposes. It may be argued that a port on the warm water is essential to Russia, quite irrespective of India, as a base for operations in far Eastern waters, and that a railway to (say) Ohahbaris therefore inevitable. But whether directed against India or not the incidental danger to India of a Russian base at Chahbar would be so great that Lord Lansdowne’s w r arning w r ould have to become operative. Of course it is conceivable that in the future the conditions of railwaytransport may so alter that what is impossible now will become inevitable then. But no practical policy can be based on that assumption, which may safely be left to be dealt with until it has verified itself. What has to be remembered is that by whatever line the approach is made there lie between British India and the Persian frontier not less than 360 miles of waterless desert; and it is submitted that the inevitableness, in existing conditions, ol a railway across that gap has not been proved. Conclusions. It would doubtless be possible to attach too much weight to these considerations. If there were a strong case for the Trans-Persian Railway on its own merits, they might be allowed to weigh very lightly against it But notoriously there is not. This memorandum does not profess to deal with that part of the subject, which has been exhaustively discussed by all the competent authorities, to whose conclusions there is nothing at present to be added-. A • selection of them is, however, printed in an appendix, in order that stock may once more be taken of them collectively, in doing' so two points must be borne in mind as regards the Indian authorities :— (1.) The Government of India’s opinion is, on the surface, less qualifier! than the others. But it should be noted that they refer to their Committee’s report and say that they concur generally in its conclusions. But those conclusions are drawn from certain premisses, and, in the absence of any statement to the contrary, it must be assumed that the Government of India accept the premisses also. Ihese are stated as follows : “ 4. While, therefore, from the point of view of military policy there can be little question that the maintenance of the status quo would be preferable to the construction of the proposed railway, and while it seems at least doubtful whether the advantages to Indian trade would be at all commensurate with the advantages which would accrue to Russian trade with Persia, or with the financial outlay involved in the undertaking, we are nevertheless of opinion that having regard to the desirability of meeting the wishes of the Russian Government and the importance of obtaining a due share in the control of any railway that may be made in Persian territory, and in view of the opportunity which now offers of obtaining concessions for branch lines which are important to us, both strategically and commercially, the Government of India will be well advised to accept in principle the proposals of the Russian Consortium, subject to such conditions in respect of alignment, branch lines, &amp;c., as may be considered necessary to secure the safety of India and the development of Indian trade.” The Government of India’s recommendation must therefore be taken as subject to the same qualification as the others. (2.) Lord Morley, in sending out the scheme to the Government of India, asked them to examine it, “ bearing in mind the desire of His Majesty’s Government to find themselves on common ground with the Russian “ Government, so far as they can do so consistently with their primary duty “ of insuring Indian interests against all probable risks.” (Secret Despatch Ho. 32, of 4th November 1910). It may therefore be assumed that all those who gave opinions intended to give the most favourable opinions they conscientiously could. That this was actually so is obvious even from the selection in the appendix; it becomes plainer if the opinions are read in full. We have in them, then, the utmost that can be said for the scheme, and the burden of all of them is in effect, “ we do not like the scheme of a “ through railway, it has no merits of its own, and many dangers; but on “ certain considerations, not strictly relevant to the scheme of a Trans- “ Persian railway as such, we must acquiesce in it with as good a grace as “ we can.” The object of this memorandum has been to attempt to show that those extraneous considerations are without substance. * See, however, note at end.Jf that attempt has been successful, then, in order to justify British encouragement of the scheme, we are driven back on the first reason suggested on page 1, viz., the desire to please the Russian Government. If it is really the case that the withdrawal of our encouragement will endanger the entente, and if the European position, and the position of Great Britain in international politics, are therefore such as to make it necessary—even in the face of the dangers and disadvantages indicated by two successive Chiefs of the Imperial General Staff—to come into line with Russia (a matter of which the India Office has no cognizance), there is nothing more to be said.' :!: ' If the scheme is to he abandoned. But if that is nut so, and the question is still open, it is for consideration whether His Majesty’s Government should not take the first opportunity of receding from a policy which is so likely to develop to their disadvantage. There are 4t*wr ways in which this can be done :— (1.) The Russian Government can be frankly informed that after further full consideration His Majesty’s Government are satisfied that the time is not ripe for the scheme, which cannot, in any conditions that can be foreseen within a reasonable period, be expected to pay, and entails other incon veniences and responsibilities which we are unwilling to incur except in return for advantages of which this scheme offers no certainty. It might be suggested that, leaving this more ambitious proposal to the future, the two Powers should in the meantime confine themselves to, and at once take in hand, railway development in their own spheres, and, by joint agreement, in the neutral sphere. If the larger scheme is really “inevitable ” it will come of itself when the lines more immediately profitable have been constructed. At the same time it would be necessary to deal with the question of a loan to Persia; for, as Lord Crewe has pointed out, by agreeing that the Societe d'Etudes should also be the agency for floating a loan, we have put into Russia’s hands the means of exerting great pressure on us ; since, if the Societe find the money, we can hardly object to tbeir having the concession. This is a most important consideration, and must be borne in mind, even if the view taken in this memorandum is not accepted, and the scheme is proceeded with. If the Societe find the money now and produce a scheme which contains features objectionable to India, the pressure to sacrifice Indian interests will be very severe. (2.) To make it impossible for the British group to go on. This can be done either:— (a) By telling them—or letting them understand—in reply to the direct question asked in Sir W. Garstin’s letter of 9th December that His Majesty’s Government regard the scheme with disfavour; or (h) By telling them, in reply to that letter and the letter of 20th December, that His Majesty’s Government can give them no further guidance and cannot promise support to any particular scheme beforehand— a rather dangerous course seeing that, if the British group w*ent on in spite of this discouragement, a concession in terms inconvenient to us might be possibly carried through by Russian pressure at Tehran and forced upon us; (c) By informing the British group at once of our conditions and making them so stringent that it will not be worth while to proceed. (d) By encouraging the Persian Railways Syndicate to adopt a non possumus attitude as regards branch lines. The British group have stated that the main line will depend for its success on the traffic brought by certain branches, of which it is understood that they attach special importance to one from Bunder Abbas to Kerman. On the other hand His Majesty’s Government are under a binding obligation to support the Persian Railways Syndicate in respect of certain lines in Southern Persia, of which the Bunder Abbas-Kerman line is one. Obviously therefore it is essential that * Except that, as between Indian and Imperial revenues, the situation indicated in India Office letter of 6th April 1911 will thus have arisen and if Indian frontiers are made more vulnerable by a scheme of railway extension, which Imperial policy and the attitude of His “ Majesty’s Government towards European Powers force upon the acceptance of India, her “ claims upon the Imperial Exchequer will be strong.”the Societe and the Syndicate should come to terms, and if the latter refuse to do so, the British group would not improbably withdraw. hio\\, inasmuch &lt;ts the Syndicate have applied for a mining concession in the Kerman area, it is very unlikely that they will be willing to let the Bunder Abbas-Kerman line go unless His Majesty’s Government apply pressure. And it is submitted that as regards both this line and the others for which they have promised their support His Majesty’s Government would not only be justified in not applying such pressure, but would not be justified in applying it. For these are the lines—lines from the Gulf inland—which by universal consent are the lines which will really further British interests, and there can be no reason for allowing them to pass out of British hands into the hands of an international Company who will work them in the interests of the main line. This applies especially to the Bunder Abbas-Kerman line, because it is in the British sphere, and, Kerman being one of the danger points, ought to remain under purely Bri tish control. If this course is adopted Mr. Green way should be asked to apply for this concession at once or as soon as the Mohammerah-Khorremabad concession is assured. By neither of these alternatives can His Majesty’s Government hope to escape the odium w ith the llussian Government of having wrecked the scheme ; for Lord Revelstoke (who, it is understood, is already using every means of inducing the Russian Government to put pressure on us) will not fail to let. it be generally known. (3.) To continue to support the scheme, though without enthusiasm, in principle, trusting that when it comes eventually to be put before the public, it will prove to be hopelessly unattractive. ‘ Taken by itself this— which is the course we have hitherto been pursuing—has little to recommend it except that it postpones for a year or so the painful necessity of taking a decision. Combined with (2) (c) it would probably be effective ; alone it seems too risky; and moreover exposes us to constant friction’with the British group in the meantime. Of all these alternatives undoubtedly (1) is the best, because it is the most straightforward ; but if for diplomatic reasons it is impracticable, then the line of least resistance is (2) (c) and (d) in combination. But if it is decided to adopt any of these courses it is most important that the Mohammerah-Khorremabad concession should be absolutely assured before our hand is shown ; for the Russians will undoubtedly try to block it if they' find that we are backing out of the Trans-Persian scheme. Great pressure should therefore be exercised at Tehran to secure it with the least possible delay. If the scheme is to he supported. If, however, His Majesty’s Government decide that the Trans-Persian railway scheme is one which they must ex animo support in the interests of this country and of India, it is essential, as pointed out above, first of all to bung the Societe and the I ersinn Railway's Syndicate to terms regarding branch lines. It also seems desirable to give the fullest possible information for the guidance of the British group. There are of course some questions which cannot be decided at the present stage, and it is necessary that we should make the strictest reservations on the points covered by Foreign Office letter of 23rd November last to Sir W. E. Garstin, viz., alignment, constitution of Board, representation of British interests, percentage of construction orders, freight, and passenger rates, and gauge. But while keeping a free hand on all these points, it is still possible to give the group a fairly clear clue. For example, they might be told that they must assume as a working hypothesis— (а) That the main line must enter the British sphere at Bunder Abbas. (б) That it must not be aligned via Kerman. (c) I hat the gauge east of Bunder Abbas must be narrower than that on the northern section of the line.(d) 1 liat the question of maritime facilities to be granted on the Persian Gulf, and of the control of such port or ports, must be a subject of agreement between the British and Persian Governments. As regards (a) the Government of India have indicated a willingness to compromise on an alignment that would enter the British sphere a little to the north of Bunder Abbas, and, eliminating that port, would reach the sea at Chahbar. This is a point for the Defence Committee; but primd facie there seem strong objections to the creation of a port of that nature on the open sea outside the Gulf. (6) Represents the formal and twice repeated opinion of the Government of India. (c) Was recommended by the Government of India’s Committee on the ground that a hostile Power would find it more difficult to widen a narrow gauge than to lay a line within a broader gauge. (d) Will require careful consideration by the Defence Committee. It will obviously be a stumbling block to the Societe, and it may be that if other adequate measures are taken to secure the entrance to the' Gulf, it will be a matter of indifference to us who controls the ports inside it. And again, it may be considered that, if it is essential that we should control the ports, we can more easily secure the control through the Railway Company than through the Persian Government. But in the first instance, and to prevent the question escaping from our hands, it seems desirable to make this stipulation. A. H. 3rd January 1913. NOTE. Three points of disadvantage in the Trans-Persian Railway scheme which do not seem to have been sufficiently considered are submitted for examination. (1.) The loss to British Shipping. —The Russian promoters count the mail subsidy among their assets. The subsidy paid to the Peninsular and Oriental by His Majesty’s Government is 305,000k Again, if an extensive passenger traffic by railway really springs up, the loss will fall almost entirely on the Peninsular and Oriental, for the railway will always be dearer than the sea route, and the Peninsular and Oriental are the dearest sea route. The Peninsular and Oriental have few friends—deservedly ; but they are still a British Company, and is not more justification required than has yet been shown for taking money out of the pocket of an all- British Company, and putting it into the pocket of a company of which only one-third will be British ? (2.) The loss to Indian Ports. —If the railway is built Bunder Abbas will become a great port at the expense of Bombay and Karachi. The Board of Trade seem to anticipate that any advantage that may accrue from the railway will be to Indian rather than British trade. No reason is given for that view. But in any case, will not British goods destined for Persia--- instead of going, as at present, to Bombay or Karachi and being transshipped there—go direct to Bunder Abbas ? This would apply also to the trade via other Gulf ports and also Bagdad ; and it should be remembered that the trade of the British Empire with Persia is nearly double that of purely Indian trade with Persia, and is worth some three millions sterling. (3.) The dead loss to Indian Revenues on the section from Bunder Abbas to Karachi.-—All authorities are agreed that owing to the nature of the country through which it runs this section cannot in any case be profitable, but attention has not been called to the full extent and nature of the probable loss. If a passenger traffic springs up, there will, it is true, be the passengers. But even supposing that the existence of the railway stimulates Indian trade, it will apparently only be goods from the north of India that will be sent by rail. For seeing that there must necessarily be break of bulk at BunderAbbas (because of the chauge of gauge), will it uot always pay Bombay and the south to send their goods by sea? JNow the Bunder Abbas-Karachi section, which is about 835 miles long, falls into two parts. The part w^est of the frontier of British Baluchistan alone (420 miles) will belong to the Company ; the part between that frontier and Karachi (415 miles) the Indian Government must necessarily ow r n themselves as part of the Indian railway system. The loss on the latter will therefore fall on Indian revenues. Is the Secretary of State for India in Council prepared to face it, in addition to the increased military and naval expenditure foreshadowed by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff? and in any case, what becomes of the guarantee which the Government of India are asked to give out of the supposed profit to Indian railways ? A. H.APPENDIX. Extracts from opinions of various Authorities. Board of Trade, 13th September 1910. “ The Board desire ... to state . . . that in their opinion the scheme in question is of a very speculative character and has been put forward mainly in Russian interests .... “In any event, while Russian trade would probably be considerably benefited by the construction of such a line as that proposed—and possibly Indian trade also in a less degree—United Kingdom trade would probably not be benefited by it to any material extent, at any rate for a long time after its opening. The possibility, indeed, might have to be faced that the expansion of Russian trade in the interior of Persia might take place at the expense of purely United Kingdom trade. “ The Board .... agree with Mr. Worthington’s view that so far as regards through traffic, the transport of passengers would probably form the bulk of the business of such a line, though even here the powerful com petition of the sea route would always remain to be contended against. As regards through goods traffic, whether to the Far East, to Australasia, or to the Persian Gulf littoral, they do not think that the railway route would be utilised to any appreciable extent .... “ . . . If . . . two conditions be fulfilled, viz., a line from Kerman to the Gulf in the control of which British influence should pre dominate, and equal facilities for all throughout the whole railway, the Board think that llis Majesty’s Government might adopt an attitude of benevolent neutrality towards the scheme. “ The Board, however, doubt if, from a commercial point of view, the scheme is for the present likely to prove a success or to attract the investing public, unless the British, Indian, or Russian Governments, or the three jointly, are prepared to offer a guarantee of a certain minimum return on the capital embarked.” Chief Commissioner, Baluchistan (Sir A. H. McMahon, K.C.I.E.), 20th December 1910. “ . . . It is unwise to expect that the present isolation of Persia can longer continue, or that we can indefinitely maintain freedom for India from intercommunication by rail from the west. “ The present proposal offers opportunities of a mutual arrangement on favourable terms, and if we decline to take advantage of it, we may be compelled hereafter to seek similar inter-railway connection under less favourable conditions. “ The proposed railway must benefit Russian trade in much larger proportion than British trade, but it will benefit Indian trade and largely increase the bulk of both British and Indian trade by the opening up of Persia. ‘ It will increase the receipts of Indian railways and thereby benefit Indian revenues. “ The military or political disadvantages of inter-railway communication are less than might at first sight be supposed, and are largely counteracted by the access afforded by the line to Seistan. “ These conclusions are arrived at on the assumption that our efforts are directed to preventing the line destroying the autonomy of Persia . . .” s. 192. 0 _. -Political Resident, Persian Gulf (Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E.), 20tli December 1910. “As I understand the position, we must now assume complete good faith on the part of Russia under the Convention, and abandonment of former designs on India. We cannot, therefore, take our stand on the fundamental objections of Indian strategists against the connection of the Indian and Russian railway systems. If the above premise is conceded, it seems to me that an attitude of mere benevolent neutrality will hardly suffice, and might be dangerous; and that having exercised the right, which the promoters concede to us, of constructing the line from Kerman southwards, we should support the present proposal to the extent oi‘ co-operating in the thorough examination of the project from the business and engineering points of view. . . . “ . . . With the above safeguards [i.e., concessions for certain branch lines, &amp;c.], and provided that commercial facilities for all be assured throughout the whole railway, 1 believe that both Indian and English trade would benefit and find new openings equally with Russian, and it cannot but be supposed that the general effect of the railway would be to improve the administration, develop the country, and increase the capacity of the Persian market.” IV. Director-General of Commercial Intelligence, India (Mr. E. Noel Paton), 31st December 1910. “ . . . 1 . . think that the Board of Trade view of the value of the railway for trade purposes is much nearer the truth than that of Sir Henry McMahon. In fact I agree generally with the Board of Trade. . . . I agree . . . that, having regard to the conditions under which it almost certainly would be constructed, the railway stands to do a great deal more for Russian than for Indian trade. Indian trade with Persia can best be served by railways from the seaboard. ... If participation in this inland railway is to divert attention from the littoral lines (and it will be strange if it does not) such participation will be deplorable. I agree, therefore, that the immediate construction of a line to the Gulf should . . . be assured. . . “ . . . If it can be assured, then we may . . . look at the new inland project with a wider view . . . Most of the main impediments to progress of all sorts [in Persia] are precisely of the kind that give way before improved communications. It is not merely a question of improved transportation; . . . . but all those other obstacles .... must almost certainly persist until a railway opens the country up ... . No doubt the new railway will serve her [i.e., Russia] better than it will us, but it will serve us too, and on the whole it would, I think, create a greater likelihood of our getting even with Ltussia than can be said to exist at present It is almost incredible that the more intimate commerce, mercantile and social, that would attend the creation of a railway, could fail to bring about some sort of assimilation of that part of Persia which is nearest our borders. I should imagine that from a political point of view this would be worth something even if the railway did not pay for a good many years. I should not expect it to pay in the literal sense until the process of assimilation had gone pretty far. . . .”Chief of the General Staff, India (Lieutenant-General Sir Douglas Haig, K.C.I.E., &amp;c.)&gt; 3rd January 1911. “ . . . . The previous military policy of India has been based upon maintaining its stiategic isolation, so that attack becomes, if not impossible, at all events so difficult and lengthy an operation as to involve great financial strain on the attacking power, and to ensure that before decisive issue is joined, the whole military strength of the British Empire will be available .... “ • • • • The advocates of the scheme .... evidently anticipate difficulties on our part, and, assuming that a line will ultimately be constructed, the problem becomes one of rendering it as strategically innocuous to India as possible, by finding some artificial obstacle which will in some measure take the place of the natural barrier which it is proposed to pieice, so that the strain thrown upon the military resources of the Empire in the event of foreign aggression may be neither too sudden nor too severe for them to bear. In the opinion of the General Staff such a substitute can only be found in making use of our preponderating sea power, as a means of control of the proposed line, and in adequate fortification, at some distance from the frontier of India, of a naval base through which the proposed line must run . . . . ” VI. President of the Railway Board, India (Sir T. R. Wynne, K.C.S.I., &amp;c.) 6th January 1911. . . . . As a through line connecting India and Europe, the proposal has no claim to any merit from the Indian commercial point of view. The possibility of goods traffic being carried by the line between England and India is quite out of the question. The difference in length between the rail and sea route to India, taking Karachi as a centre, will be very small, and the sea route will always be by fai the cheapei in cost of transport of goods, besides being more convenient and also shorter to places in the south of India .... “In regard to passenger traffic between England and India, the practical effect of the building of the railway will probably be that steamer fares will be reduced and they will still retain the traffic. Further, passenger traffic between Europe generally and India must be small .... As a railway proposition .... it is not a scheme which one could recommend the Government of India to have anything to do with from the financial point of view j but the line is one of quite an unusual character, and it has to be considered from other points than those affecting railway finance .... 1 hat North Persia will be opened out by a railway which will either be international or Russian seems certain, and what India has now to do is to take advantage of the present position to consolidate itself in Southern Persia. The course indicated seems clear, and it is to welcome cordially the proposed through line as an international railway and to agree at once to make as part of the Indian Railway system a line from Nushki to some point in Seistan which is suitable for a junction with the international railway. 1 he ready acceptance by India of the international scheme would be a useful card in the direction of counteracting the negotiations now in progress between Russia and Germany, which may lead to Northern Persia being opened out by a Russian railway with the same objects as were in mind when the Manchurian line was constructed to Port Arthur ....’'12 VII. Inter-Departmental Committee, appointed by Government of India reported 8th February 1911. * This Committee consisted of the Honourable Mr. W. H. Clark, Commercial Member of Council, Lieutenant-General Sir D. Haig, Chief of the General Staff, Sir T. R. Wynne, President of the Railway Board, and Mr. J. B. AVood, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. From the purely strategical point of view ... it would undoubtedly be preferable that India should maintain her quasi - insular position and should refuse to co-operate in any scheme which would tend to facilitate the transportation of a hostile Power up to or across her frontier. We recognise, however, that the march of events in the Near and Middle East renders it impossible that this position of isolation can be indefinitely^ maintained .... From this standpoint it seems to us desirable to seize the opportunity which the present proposal offers for securing the conditions which we consider essential rather than to wait until circumstances may force us to permit the connection on terms which may be less advantageous. With regard to the merits of the enterprise from the commercial point of view, we are in general agreement with the opinions expressed in the letter from the Board of Trade . . . We do not consider that there is any likelihood of goods being carried on the railway from the United Kingdom to India or vice versa . . . ^ We are inclined to doubt also whether the through passenger traffic on the railway would be of any great magnitude The proposed line can, therefore, hardly be expected to prove a financial success .... • • • We are nevertheless of opinion that having regard to the desirability of meeting the wishes of the Russian Government and the importance of obtaining a due share in the control of any railway that may be made in Persian territory, and in view of the opportunity which now offers of obtaining concessions for branch lines which are important to us, both strategically and commercially, the Government of India will be well advised to accept in principle the proposals of the Russian Consortium, subject to such conditions in respect of alignment, branch lines, &amp;c., as may be considered necessary to secure the safety of India and the development of Indian trade. . . .” VIII. Government of India, 23rd February 1911. . We concur generally in these conclusions [i.e. y those of the Inter-departmental Committee], except in regard to a few points as to which we find ourselves unable to endorse the recommendations of the Committee. . . . . With these reservations we commend the Committee’s proposals to the favourable consideration of His Majesty’s Government.” IX. Chief of the General Staff, War Office (Field-Marshal Lord Nicholson, G.C.B., &amp;c.), 26th April 1911. “ it is not clear what advantage we shall gain by railway construction in Southern Persia. The Muhammadan population is small and turbulent, the country is badly governed, life and property are insecure, and though some districts are fertile, most of Southern Persia is believed to consist of mountains and deserts. ... It will always be easier and cheaper to carry on our passenger traffic and our commerce with India by sea than by land. ...“ l . t , 18 Proposed by the military authorities in India that a lone stretch of radway shouldrunalongthe sea-board from Bunder Abbas to Karachi naval force in the Vu f ^ f a? 1 r ^ way we should have t0 increase our orce m the Gulf and to distribute a military force along the line it n Y u aDy C - a i Se w , e , S10U ( have t0 P a y heavily for these precautions and d has to be considered how the ships and troops are to be provided ’ bilitfos fof Xe rfeWe °rth a - n&lt;1 military P oint of view . ou r responsi- m i 1 1 def i e i nce pf the Empire are so extensive at present that it Southern Sia° From ‘a?

To this end it examines the potential benefits, and who (Britain, Germany, Persia, or Russia) stands to gain/lose the most from the project; it looks into the commercial, strategic, and political implications of the railway from a British perspective. It also provides advice on the steps to be taken by the British Government depending on whether it chooses to back or oppose the scheme.
