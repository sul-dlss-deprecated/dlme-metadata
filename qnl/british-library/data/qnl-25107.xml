Political Agent, Bahrein, on receipt of which I addressed the abovementioned telegram to Government. 2. In the absence of certainty as to the present attitude of Government in regard to the position on the Qatar promontory, the action taken by Captain Lorimer in addressing Shaikh Jasim bin Thani seems suitable and innocuous. 2. I may mention that the headman of Fuwaira^Nasir bin Shahin, is the man referred to in Foreign Department letter No. 2889-E.B. of 31st August 1908, and connected correspondence. No. 417, dated Bahrein, the 3rd August 1912. From— CAPTAIN D. L. R Lorimer, I. A., Political Agent, Bahrein, To—L ieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.LE., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward enclosed a statement made to me by one Muhammad Musa bin Ismail and a copy of a letter which I am addressing to Shaikh Jasim bin Muhammad bin Thani of Qatar. 2. These documents sufficiently explain the facts of the case, but the following additional remarks may be added The plaintiff’s precise nationality is a matter of some doubt. He possesses a sort of passport in Arabic, mentioning the names of himself and his ship, purporting to be issued by one Sultan ( Uthman Mahmud Yusuf, and dated 8th Rajab 1325. The document is however neither signed nor sealed. It appears to state that the vessel at some time sailed from Bundar ’Alula, but the plaintiff has failed to make me understand exactly where this place may be.^ It is probably the place of that name shown in the maps near Cape Gardafui in Italian (?) Somaliland. The document further bears in red ink in English Sambuk Dabus ” and “ Register of Haloola In any case the man is a foreigner and as such entitled to our protection. 3. Nasir bin Shahin-ut-Tuwar, who is for all practical purposes accused of robbery and using criminal force, is the notorius Qatar debtor. ^ In 1911, he was induced to come over to Bahrein, and was kept in detention in the Agency tor several months while he came to terms with his Bahrein creditors vide corres pondence ending with your letter to me, No. lyH* dated 7th July l 9 j 1 ' settlement arrived at was far from statisfactory, but Nasir probably bears us a grudge all the same. 4. As regards the sambuk, the plaintiff states that it is badly damaged ; that the bottom was stove in, and that it is beyond the hope of repair. ^ It is a little hard to believe that its repair is beyond the resources of the Bahrein boat- builders. The assertion may be due to the plaintiff’s strong antipathy to trusting himself again in Qatar. The Bahrein boat-builders would no doubt share the same feeling, unless their safety was guaranteed by us. As the plaintiff says that the sambuk was estimated as worth $7,000, the question is perhaps worth some consideration. It may be mentioned that an entry by the Assistant Port Officer, Bombay, dated 3rd November 1906, on the ship’s paper, gives the tonnage as 1 tons.5. I have directed the Nakhuda to bring evidence as to the amount and value of the cargo, and as to fact that no assistance in salving was rendered by the people of Fuwairat. 6. It will be within your recollection that a somewhat similar case arose at Fuwairat in or about September 1909, which was referred to you by Captain Mackenzie in his letter No. 634, dated 2nd October 1909. Some correspondence with Government ensued, and the decision of His Majesty’s Government was received in a letter No. 693 E. A., dated 31st March 1910, from the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department to the Political Resident in the Persian _ Gulf. His Majesty’s Government considered that the wrecking of the Persian boat in question had not been clearly established ; and that retaliatory action on shore in Qatar was inexpedi ent in view of the Porte’s claims to sovereignty in that region. Action at sea was similarly negatived at a later date —vide the letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office, dated 3rd September 1910, forwarded under your No. 2774, dated 15th October 1910. The matter was accordingly dropped. 7. I am in ignorance as to whether the relations at present existing between the British Government and the Porte would make the former more ready, or less ready, to assert its right to direct interference in the distirct of Qatar. From the local point of view it is most undesirable that a second case of this sort should be allowed to pass unnoticed, or rather undecided, Nasir-ut Tuwar and others like him will not be slow to draw the conclusions that they are free to act towards the subjects and protegds of the British Government as they like with entire impunity ; and no foreign boat or foreigner coming to Fuwairat and similar ports will be safe. 8. In writing as I have done to Shaikh Jasim bin Thani, I have tried to reserve the right to take such action as we see good without at the same time committing ourselves to take any action at all. It is an act of courtesy to write to him as a professed friend and the principal authority in Qatar, but it is unlikely to have any very definite result. He will probably repudiate any authority and power to control Nasir, which will leave the field free to us and the Turks. On the other hand, I believe, he quite recently temporarily imprisoned Nasir and fined him, and he may be glad of a further excuse for dealing a blow at him I do not propose to communicate with Nasir- ut-Tuwar except on instructions from you. Statement of Nakhuda Muhammad Musa bin Ismail of Hdfun ) dated 25th July igi2 I I started from Hafun with cargo of w r ood in my sambnk. Besides myself there were 33 khalasis. We could not sell our cargo in Aden or Maskat and therefore proceeded to the Arab Coast. We took in a pilot from Maskat. We reached Fuwairat on the 22nd Rajab 1330. The pilot told us it was Bahrein. We anchored, but it being very stormy, the anchor broke and the sambuk ran ashore and was damaged seriously. IVe landed the cargo ashore and wanted to sell it. The Fidawis of Nasir Tuwar told us not to sell anything without taking permission fr/im the headman Nasir. The said Nasir returned from the sea after two days. He demanded half the cargo as his right. We refused to give so much. He threatened us. We were in a helpless condition. Our cargo was on the shore and sambuk broken and unable to sail. We offered one-fifth and then one-fourth but Nasir was not satisfied till he seized half of the cargo The remaining half he took from us for Rs. 1,114. He forced us to take it. « u r carg 0 consisted of 190 scores of shalman and 500 maunds (of Zanzibar — 28 lbs. each) fuel. It was worth Rs. 6,000 according to Bahrein market, t hen we were forced to sign a paper that we had no claim or complaint against iNasir. When I refused to sign it, Nasir imprisoned three of my crew. I thensigned it in order to save my life and that of my crew. We were then asked to give half of the small mashwa to Nasir. Seeing them so inclined to plunder us, we left our mashwa and sambuk in Fuwairat and sailed to Bahrein in a passenger boat. We belong to British Somaliland and are British subjects. We have now come to this Agency and request that justice be done and our right recover ed from Nasir Tuwar of Fuwairat. No. 447, dated Bahrein, the 29th July 1912 (signed 2nd August 1912). From— Captain D. .L. R. Lorimer, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrein, To— Shaikh Jasim bin Muhammad bin Thani of Qatar. After compliments .—One Nakhuda Muhammad Musa bin Ismail of Hafun in Somal has come to me and stated that owing to bad weather he put in with his baghla at Fuwairat on 22nd Rajab 133 °* s f'^P was driven ashore and seriously damaged and he and his crew landed the cargo consisting of 190 scores shalman and 500 maunds (=250 Bahrein maunds) of firewood. This they did themselves and without any assistance. The cargo is said to be worth Rs. 6,000. Nasir bin Shahin ut Tuwar however demanded half the cargo as his right. Muhammad Musa to free himself offered one-fifth or one-fourth, but this was refused. Nasir further forbade him to sell the other half of the cargo and eventually paid him Rs. l,i 14 for it, and forced him to sign a paper stating that he had received his fullright. When Muhammad Musa at first refused to sign this document, Nasir imprisoned 3 of his crew. He only then signed in order to save himself and his crew. Nasir then demanded half of the mashwa. Being afraid, the Nakhuda left everything behind and came here. He is afraid to go back. I ask that you will take immediate steps to take over charge of all the cargo and the baghla and mashwa from Nasir and prevent their being sold or other wise disposed of. I am referring to the Rais-ul-Khalij and it is probable that the cargo etc. will have to be brought to Bahrein where Nasir will be able to put in and prove any claims he may have for salvage money.

We counted out of the ship 190 score shalman. There was also 50 kindis of firewood. The sambuk was smashed. The boat’s people landed the cargo. Twenty men came from the shore to help. Their assistance was declined by the people of the boat. G. C. B. P„ Simla.—No. C 53 F. D.— 31 - 8 - 12 .— 44 .-C.G S.DRAFT TELEGRAM. SECRETARY OF STATE TO VICEROY, FOREIGN DEPARTMENT.

His Majesty’s Government consider that the deliberate wrecking of the Persian boat has not been clearly established and that it is doubtful whether the penalties proposed by Major Trevor could be enforced without action on shore on the El Katr Coast, over which the Porte claims sovereign rights which, though not admitted by the British Government have not yet been settled. 3 ^ in these circumstances it would seem to be expedient to avoid intervention and to defer action until a better case is established.

I trust the proposals which I have submitted above will commend fhemselves to the Government of India. Dated Bahrain, the 23rd December 1909. From— Captain C. F. Mackenzie, LA., Political Agent, Bahrain, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to your letter No. 3 X 37 , dated the 11 th December 1900 I have the honour to inform you that I left Bahrain on the R.I.M S Lawrerw? on Tuesday, the 15 th instant, and arrived at Gharriah the same evenin» It wiU have been observed in my Diary No. 47 for week ending 19 th NovemW 1909 , that Mohamed bin Abdul Rahman, who was made headman of the Bn Kuwara at Fuwairat when Nasir bin Shahin was turned out had on tie return of Nasir, gone with certain of his followers to live at Gharriah a village on the coast about four miles north of Fuwairat. ’ ' Ua ° e 2 The following morning the Commander of the Lawrence gave me his steam launch and I landed with my Interpreter and a Bahrain Nakhoda I hJ brought on account of his local knowledge. I was met by most of the chkf men of the village with the news that the headman, Mohamed, was in Bahrain with most of his relatives. (On return to Bahrain I heard this information was correct, but that he had left about the same time as the LawrZTe lZ with the strong shamal that was blowing should certainly have been back at Gharriah before I arrived. It was a pity that I did not get information of Ins arrival in Bahrain, but when people land at outlying ports such a“a Hedd m this case the information may only be obtained after two or three davs and sometimes longer or even not at all. Mohamed bin Abdul Rahman as^heTd- man of a small village in Katar, has of course little status in Bahrain ) One son of his only, named Gaith bin Mohamed, was to be found. We then entered a hut and the investigation was commenced. entered 3 I explained to them what I had come for, and said that I should like to record their evidence one by one while the others remained outside This however, they absolutely refused to do, and I could onl v obtain a inint * which is enclosed. This was read over to them wW coveted Tnd f ?*,’ to. They, however, stated that Mohamed bin Abd'd Rahn an W f from the Persian to the effect that he had lleen llTeatel ' N^her th Sanad nor a copy thereof was sent me bv Mohamerl Bio ABrlni t? n i I first addressed him on the subject, and I wo“ mRtt^ futTsInS under’compulsimi^and moreover' ittis a^habit^iiTsuch ra° U ^ be . made maltreatment of Persian dhow at Abu DhaM ^ 38 WaS Sh0Wn “ fte (14 I then went down with four of the chief men in the steam cutter to the place of the incident which occurred just opposite Fuwairat. The following rough diagram explains the position of the boom and the various sandbanks :— A . fs ot- /gmaf &lt; 3 / 7 c fromg e 9 fo /5 feet.

Second anchorage according to statements of tribesmen 6 to 12 feet* C. Place where Boom struck 1 to 7 feet. D. Present position of Boom 1 to 7 feet. 5. In the statements it will be observed that the tribesmen allege that the boat was taken from the anchorage A to B on the morning of the second day. This may be possible as B is protected to windward by shallow waters, but by the evening of the second day the owner of the boat would have had good opportunities of seeing the reefs, and it is to be presumed that if the wind were so strong as to make the ship unmanageable they would have used the punting poles immediately they got into sufficiently shallow water. A simpler piece of navigation would be difficult to find. It is therefore to my mind perfectly clear that the deed was done under Mohamed bin Abdul Bahman’s orders, and it is almost unnecessary to point out the facts. (a) No sane man would sell his goats from 10 to 11 rupees when he would have got about 20 a pair for them at Bahrain during Bamadhan as in that month all well-to-do Arabs, and to a certain extent the Persians also, give large nightly feasts. The tribesmen state that the goats were sold by the Nakhoda before the damage was done to the boat. (M The tribesmen say that the small jib sail was hoisted. This again shows the unlikelihood of the boat getting out of control. (c) The statement that the Boom had a small jolly-boat with it. A man would not swim ashore if he had a small boat. 6. I discovered the statement that there was only one tide in 24 hours to be incorrect, and also the boat striking on the leeward side of the reef. 7 . Brawn up on the beach I found both at Gharriah and Puwairat several boats of much larger size than the Persian Boom, and had the headman been so disposed he could easily have had this boom drawn up, so that it could be properly mended. Even if they had been guiltless of running the boom on the reef, I am strongly of opinion that neglect to give assistance to a boat m distress on a strange shore deserves not only the greatest condemnation, but also suitable punishment.The evidence that the Persian had offered rupees hundred, and that the headman had said “ I do not want your money,” is too absurd to require comment. 8. The Nakhoda stated that he had purchased the Boom for Es. 2,000 last year, but he has failed to produce the Sanad, although I told him to do so. In my opinion it was not worth more than Es. 1 , 200 . He has left the sails, mast, bowsprit, rudder, and one or two other portable necessities, whose total value may be assessed at Es. 350 , in trust with a man at Gharriah. On boats the loss to the Nakhoda may be estimated at not less than Es. 150 . On firewood the loss may be estimated at Es. 280 . The total loss is therefore approximately Es. 2 , 000 . The gain to the people of Puwairat is, however, only Es. 1,100 estimating the wood in the Boom at about Es. 300 . The extra payment of Es. 900 will, I think, be sufficient punishment as they are a poor tribe, and I consider it is advisable to act with firmness but without harshness. 9 . To recover the fine I propose to send the enclosed letter to Mohamed bin Abdul Eahman, and I trust the steps will meet with approval. Combined statement of Esa bin Rabi, Abdullah bin Jabar, Ajlan, Gaith bin Mohamed bin Abdul Rahman. The Persian Boom arrived at Puwairat and anchored under the cliffs. There was no damage done to the Boom when she arrived. They then landed their goats in a small jolly-boat they had with them. We did not land any of their goats. The owner then sold the goats. The next day they changed the position of their Boom and took it to the proper harbour. None of us were on the Boom at the time of the change. They brought the Boom into the proper harbour with the small jib sail, but it stuck the reef as the firewood load was very heavy and a hole was made in the boat. They threw out anchors. The Nakhoda then placed a black flag as a sign of distress and came off himself in his small jolly-boat. We gave him a small Mashwa to bring off the firewood and most of it was brought off in this, but the owner brought off some in his jolly-boat. The villagers brought off the remainder on their backs. The owner sold the firewood at Es. 120 a Qara, and sold the goats for Es. 10 to Es. 14 per pair. He placed the unsold firewood in a boat whose Nakhoda was Hassan bin Esa A 1 Mohammadi and who was going to Bahrain. The Persian did not ask Mohamed bin Abdul Eahman to have the Boom mended. He said he would give Es. 100 to have it brought ashore. Mohamed said “ I do not want the 100 rupees ” and he sent men to bail out the water and to stop up the hole with the sail. He did not send carpenters as the boat was under water and they could not have worked. After many efforts they were unable to brino* it ashore and after three days work left it. Gaith bin Mohamed, Jabar bin Gaith, Ali bin Shahin went off in a small mashwa to the Boom to give them permis sion to land as this is the custom here. E. O. and A. C. C. P. MACKENZIE, Captain, 'Political Agent, Bahrain. 1 1 began to ask a few questions of Gaith bin Mohamed and he said that when he arrived the Nakhoda was swimming to land, and he appeared to be ready to give me the facts of the case when every one in the room shouted No No, and it was explained that he had not much sense. He then got up and left the room amid roars of laughter.(( When I was examining the Poom I was B ”, which, however, was not mentioned in shown the alleged second anchorage the first statement. C. F.

On reading the statements of the two Nakhodas it appears to me that it will be difficult to substantiate a charge of actual piracy against the village. The Headman will doubtless contend that the men who went off to Hassan bin Ibrahim s boat went with the laudable intention of helping the crew to get her to a safe anchorage, and that the standing of the boat on the reef was a mere acci dent. But the local Headman, Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman, and the villagers appear to have behaved very badly to the Nakhoda of the wrecked boat in not assisting him to get her beached and repaired, and in forcing him to sell his goats and firewood at prices below the market rate. In taking 10 goats and one ‘qara’ of firewood the villagers probably acted on the regular Gulf custom (which is however not recognised by this Residency) of claiming i the cargo of a ship-wrecked boat as salvage. I think that the course suggested by Captain Mackenzie in the last para graph of his letter No. 639, viz., that he should go to Fuwairat in his launch and make enquiries, is the best. Should the result of his enquiry show that the Sheikh’s men had wilfully put the boom on the reef, the Sheikh should, I think, be called upon to pay a fine of (say) twice the value of the boom, out of which the owner could receive compensation for his losses. If it were proved that the boom was wrecked by an accident but that the rest of the complainant’s story were true, the Sheikh might be fined Rs. 1,000 out of which compensation could be given to the complainant. It probably would be necessary to send Captain Mackenzie in a gun-boat down to Fuwairat to recover any fine which might be inflicted, or in default to seize some of the boats belonging to the village. If the Government of India approve of the suggestion, I trust they will be pleased to issue orders by telegram, in order that the case may be promptly dealt with. No. 634, dated Bahrein, the 2nd October 1909. From— Captain C. F. Mackenzie, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The First Assistant Resident (In charge of Residency), Bushire. I have the honour to forward, herewith, two statements regarding an alleged piracy at Fuwairat, on the Katar Coast. I also enclose under flying seal a letter which I propose to send to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, but as it might lead to the Turks opposing our right to enquire into and punish the case, I considered it advisable to submit it through you. I would much like to get these statements so as to have a per fectly clear case. 2. I am writing to Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman, Headmen of the Bu Kawara tribe, and also asking for his explanation of the case, but I am afraid it is likely to be frivolous. 3. The other day when at Lusail I was speaking to Sheikh Jasim bin Thani whether he could give me any assistance in making Nasir bin Shahin at Tuwar of Fuwairat {vide correspondence ending with this office letter No. 5 ^ 4 &gt; dated the 10th October 1909) pay up the year’s instalment of his debt. He replied that he had no power there, and I think that in this case it will be quite useless to appeal to him for any help.Je 4, Before receiving the teply from Fawairat it is difficult to ffame any pro posals, but should the claimant’s story prove to be true l would suggest that a fine of Rs. 5,000 be levied on the tribe out of which the claimant will receive full payment for his losses. To recover any fine inflicted it would be necessary for me to proceed in a gmvboat and in default of a suitable arrangement for payment I should be author ised to seize their boats as security* Bushire note r—Letter to the Consul, Basrah, has not been sent on. Statement of Hass an bin Ibrahim^ Nakhoda of Akhtar {near Kangan). States on the 25th Shaban 1327, I loaded my boat with firewood and goats from Fars and sailed for Bahrein with 4 Khalasis. On the 28th Shaban 1327, a shammal drove us to Fuwairat where we anchored in the morning in about 15 or 16 feet water. I left the boat in charge of my Khalasis swimming ashore to find a buyer for my goats. In the meanwhile Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman (Al-bu-Kawara) Chief of Fuwairat sent 7 of his men in a small mashwa (unarmed by rifles or even knives). They got in my boat and sailed it on to a reef varying from 1 foot to 7 feet according to tide. The boat then broke. They then dropped the anchor and returned in the mashwa and sent four others. The next morning the boat broke up and about 20 inhabitants came off in 3 mashwas and took off the sheep. They then returned and took all the wood ashore. They stole 10 goats and one Cfara of firewood. I sold the remaining goats to different people and also the rest of the wood (three qaras) for Rs. 360, the goats for about Rs. 300, Rs. 350. The rate for wood at Bahrein would have been about Rs. 140 a qara. I would have got Rs. 500 or Rs. 600 for the goats at Bahrein. The four men went ashore at 1 Arabic on the first day of Ramadhan. The water then was about 4 feet deep and receding. When they returned early in the morning water was going out. High tide was about middle of night. I returned to the boat a little after noon the first day and stayed there. Water was in the boat up to one’s breast even on the first day. When the mashwa came, we were unable to sail as I was ashore. 1 went ashore in the hopes of selling and did not expect these actions. A Bahrein boat coming from Doha to Bahrein stopped at Fuwairat ■ This name is wrong. • Nakhoda named Mulla* Yusuf. He was present in Fuwairat when this happened, and came to Bahrein about 5 days ago. I could not come in it as I had not finished my sales. Khalifa brought me and my four Khalasis. He returned last night. I arrived in Muharraq the evening before yesterday. I came to complain yester day but the Munshi said he was busy and told me to come the following day. 1 bought the Boom from Haji Rajab for Rs. 2,000, last year. I asked Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman to have it mended. He said pay me Rs. 50 to bring it up on shore. 1 said yes. He then cried off and wanted a paper to say that he was half owner of the boat, il refused this. Taken in my presence and hearing 30th day of September 1909. Read over and found correct. Bahrein ; 20th September 1909 } (Sd.) C. F. MACKENZIE. Statement of Hamad bin Saud Koweiti } Nakhoda. I am Nakhoda in the pearling boat of Yakub of Muharraq. At Guffal I went to Doha thinking I might bring passengers for Bahrein, I brought 50 r\I passengers of which there were 30 Turkish soldiers including Abdul Razaq and Najam Effendi. There were no respectable men among the other passengers. A shammal rose and as our drinking water became scarce I put in to Fuwairat and arrived there one day before Ramadhan after midday. There were 5 or 6 other pearling boats in the harbour. In the morning of the next day I saw a Boom come in which anchored in plenty of water. I saw a man swimming ashore from the Boom at about 2 o'clock (Arabic). After I saw 5 or 6 mem swimming out to a small mashwa. They got into this mashwa and sailed out to the Boom. They got into the Boom and sailed towing the small mashwa. They sailed on to a reef and dropped the anchor. I then swam to the Boom to buy goats which I had seen on the boat. When I had arrived I found many Bedouins had got there before me and each was finding pieces of cloth, etc., in the boat and attaching them to the goats to recognize their own plunder. They put the goats into the mashwa and into another mashwa. They returned afterwards for the remainder. By this time there were 50 or 60 Arabs in the Boom. The Nakhoda swam back. About sunset the Bedouins went in mashwa back to the shore. There was about 3 feet, of water in the Boom. I returned to my ship. Early next morning the Nakhoda swam to me and I swam back with him to his Boom which I found was sunk. I took the 20 sheep that were left and the sails of the Boom to my boat. Bedouins came off and blamed and threatened me for taking the goats. I told them what I thought of them. But they brought boats and took these away from me. The Turkish soldiers were unarmed. I was afraid to oppose them. They then took onions and the wood from the Boom to the shore. 1 left Fuwairat on the 3rd day of Ramadhan and arrived Bahrein on the 5th Ramadhan. I have been here now for 11 days. Taken in my presence and hearing 1st day of October 1909. Read over and found correct. 1 Bahrein ; 1st October igog. 1 (Sd.) C. F. MACKENZIE. No. 639, dated Bahrin, the 2nd October 1909. From— Captain C. F. Mackenzie, I.A., Political Agent, Baherin, jo MAJOR A. P. Trevor, I.A., First Assistant Resident (In charge Residency), Bushire. In continuation of my letter No. 634, dated the 2nd October 1909, I have the honour to inform you that I have since arrested a Fuwairat Nakhoda, who was implicated in the piracy, and took from him the enclosed statement, which was only obtained after a good deal of prevarication. I promised him pardon as far as I was concerned because— (a) the principal offence was in running the Boom on to the reef, and (b) our principal care will be to exact reparation from the headman who will take himself fines from the petty robbers. 2. In my opinion there is absolutely no doubt about the piracy as striking the reef from the leeward is most convincing and I think it is now unnecessary to forward my letter to His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah, for the evidence of the Turkish officers. 3. I am writing to Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman for an explanation of the matter. It is practically certain that it will be unsatisfactory. I would therefore propose that on hearing Government orders, I should go to Fuwairat in my launch and I should be previously empowered if after a full investigation I am still of opinion that the tribe is guilty to demand a fine of Rs tr 000 and making arrangements for its payment. Should the headman refuse to pay 1 should be authorised to tell him that I will return with a gunboat and attach their pearling boats for security.Copy of statement of Ali bin Saqar bin Ali of fiuwairat* An Akhtari arrived in Fuwairat with his jolly boat two days before Ramzan He anchored near a hill on the north of Fuwairat. Gaith bin Muhammad (son of the headman of the Bu Kowara) and Ali and Ahmed bin Shahin both of whom f~^- are nephews of the headman Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman, Jabir bin Gaith and others whose names I don t know w’ent out in a small mashwa and said to the khallasies of the Boom : ' If you wish it we will lead you to the harbour.” They said alright. I have heard that they then set sail. Afterwards they struck on the reef which is about half a mile from the place where the jolly boat was first anchored. The boat struck on the leeward of the reef. It was impossible to get her off as the tide was going out and as there is only one tide in 24 hours it had broken up before anything could be done. The passage by this reef is rather difficult and many boats have broken on it. My jolly boat and others brought off the wood and goats. Muhammad bin Abdul Rahman ordered the people of Fuwairat not to take anything from the people of the Boom. When I went in my boat to the Persian Boom, I saw that the anchor was dropped on the reef.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100027915585.0x000002_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/155/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100027915585.0x000002</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/155/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 3208/1908 Pt 2 ‘Persian Gulf: Fuwairat piracy case’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1909/1912</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-12-17T12:49:04</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>29 folios</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Correspondence relating to an incident taking place at Fuwairat, Qatar, in October 1909, in which a Persian vessel bound for Bahrain carrying a cargo of goats and firewood, was alleged by its nakhuda to have been deliberately scuppered on rocks by the inhabitants of Fuwairat, and the cargo then sold at Fuwairat at prices below their Bahrain market value.Correspondence from the Political Agent at Bahrain (Captain Charles Fraser Mackenzie) details his attempts to substantiate the claim, estimate the financial loss suffered by the nakuda, and set the extent of the fine to be charged against the inhabitants of Fuwairah (ff 30-31, ff 26-28). Subsequent correspondence dated 1910, exchanged between Sir Louis Du Pan Mallet of the Foreign Office, and India Office officials, casts doubt on aspects of the case, and also questions whether any action can be taken on the El Katr [Qatar] coast, over which the Ottoman Porte claims sovereignty.Correspondence relating to a second, similar incident at Fuwairah in 1912, includes renewed discussion of what action should be taken with regard to incidents of ‘piracy’ on the Qatar coast, with a copy of a letter addressed to Shaikh Jasim bin Muhammad bin Thāni [Jāsim bin Muḥammad Āl Thānī] by the Political Agent at Bahrain (Captain David Lockhart Robertson Lorimer) (ff 4-5).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Fuwairat</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Law of the sea</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shipwrecks</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fines (penalties)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100027915585.0x000002#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
