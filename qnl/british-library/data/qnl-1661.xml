Other enclosures include letters to the Editor of
                           The Times, and copies of official correspondence regarding Major Frederic John Goldsmid.The later correspondence from 1860 to 1861 relates to Pelly's journey through Persia and Afghanistan and focuses on methods of ensuring that Pelly receives letters and telegrams en-route and also discussing matters from Aghanistan that may have an impact on India and its frontiers.The correspondence from Lord Lytton and Lord Northbrook among others related to Sir Lewis's appointment in Baroda and the deposition of the Gaekwar of Baroda both of which Sir Lewis considered to be sensitive subjects and which was removed from the collection at the request of Lady Pellyfollowing its deposit with the India Office in 1923 (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="personal"><namePart>John Jacob</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000001524.0x000379#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
