The file was last submitted at P.Z.7985/34 on a report of a conyersation between the Iraqi Director General of Foreign Affairs and the Persian Minister at Bagdad on the anti-British aims of Persian policy in the Gulf. A more detailed account of this conversation, as related by the Director General himself to the First Secretary of the British Embassy, is at P.Z. 520/35. The last minute on the main question of the Perso-Iraqi dispute is at P.Z.7902/34 reporting Iraq's appeal to the League. The somewhat large mass of papers since added to the file show the course of the negotiations for a settlement of the dispute under League auspices at Geneva and subsequently at Home. It cannot he said that from the Iraqi/- 2 - ignoring/ 295 tilings have recently gone Iraqi and British points of view very well. z. At the very outset Mr. Eden, the United Kingdom representatiye urged before the Council that, since an amicable adjustment of the dispute had hitherto been prevented owing to irreconcilable differences of opinion on a purely legal issue, namely the validity of the documents on which thepresent frontier was based, the opinion of an expert legal body such as the Hague Court should be sought in order to provide the necessary basis fcr a settlement (P.Z.405/35). The Iraqis are in favour of this, but the Persians, who can hardly fail to realise the extreme weakness of their legal case (see on this the Foreign Office note at Flag A on the validity of the 1913 Protocol and 1914 Delimitation of the Frontier), have opposed this solution 'and it appears that owing to the unanimous rule they could always block a decision by the Council to request an advisory opinion from the Hague Court (paragraph 2(e) of Rome telegram No. 67 at P.Z.756/35). 3. Meanwhile Baron Alois!, the Italian representative on the Council and the rapporteur appointed to compose the dispute, has suggested provisional arrangements in the Shatt-el-Arab (pending the final settlement of the dispute) which would in effect conflict with the authority of the Basra Bert Directorate and give the Persians a large measure of control in the Shaft, the waters of which (with the exception of the Persian anchorage at «, pu ™ ly Ir , u „ ooralns to ires&lt;nt fronti&gt;r /P.Z. 873/35 and P.Z.1047/35 (French text n-p / vjiencn text of rapporteur's proposal//.

He to regard the Iraqi attitude in refusing to agree to his suggested provisional arrangements as intransigent and there is a danger that in his report he may put the blame on the Iraqis in the event of failure to compose the dispute. If. The Foreign Office are somewhat disturbed at the Italian attitude on this question and there are strong suspicions which are shared by Sir Francis Humphrys that the Italians are anxious to placate the Persians with a view to obtaining advantages for themselves, such as a Persian order for additional warships from Italy and the reinstatement of Italian officers serving with the Persian Navy, and that they have anbitions of adopting the role of mediator in the Shatt by substituting Italy for Great Britain as the neutral State which would provide the third member to any board constituted to control the navigation of the river. There can be little doubt that Baron Aloisi, and also the League Secretariat^ are aiming at the permanent internationalisa tion of the Shatt which would not be at all in accordance with British interests (see paragraph 6 of Rome telegram No. 89 of 8th February at P.Z .1109/35) . The Foreign Office also disapprove of the pressure brought to bear by the/ 2956 6000 7 34the Italians on Nuri Pasha to sign the Italo-Iraqi Treaty of friendship at once when an Italian is acting as rapporteur in the frontier dispute (P.Z.754/35). S' The Foreign Office have advised the Iraqis to continue to reject the temporary arrangements in the Shatl suggested by the rapporteur and to press for a settlement of the juridical issue, while making it clear that Iraq is still prepared to offer Persia the Conservancy Board^ &lt;1 'Qr*- tB^to is inage Agreement, etc. as soon as the question of the validity ofthe frontier has been disposed of; Buri Pasha, who has recently been recalled by the Iraqi Government to Bagdad for consultation, is sending a lette: on these lines to the rapporteur (F. 0. telegram Bo. 61 of 13th February to Bagdad at P.Z.1116/35 and Bagdad telegrai Bo.42 of 16th February at P.Z.1214/35). It is indeed just possible that but for the attitude of the Italian rapporteur the Persians (who had first betrayed their nervousness at the reference of the dispute to the League by making frequent appeals to H.M.G. at Tehran, Geneva and London to use their influence to persuade the Iraqis to compromise on the question of the frontier) might already have agreed to the solution now proposed by the Iraqis. In this connection the records at P.Z.838/35 of the Persian Minister's conversations at the Foreign Office With Mr. Eendel and Sir Bobert Vansittart on S8th and 29th January last are north reading. e. The tentative Foreign Office suggestion (mentioned inthe second paragraph of the minute at P.Z. 7902/34) for a compromise of the frontier question in the Shatt on the basis of the offer to the Persians of the Thalweg or midstream line in return foi|their acceptance of the Conservancy Board etc. has of ™ has, 0 f course, receded into the background in view of* + h appeal t0 the League and there can be no question of amr on of any such suggestion being mooted/f Minute Paper. Department. - 5 - r' 64 ^ ^ ° UrrenCy present aisput, It may, hoW eyer, be mentioned that the Foreign Office case has been even further weakened by the strong opposition recently expressed by Sir Francis Humphrys (supported by the Minister at Tehran) to any readju B t mal t the frontier^]?.2^.708/35) and by the recent information that, owing to/the conformation of the mud banks at the mouth of the riyer, the whole of the Hooka Channel (the deep water approach to the Shatt) now lies exclusiyely in Iraqi waters. 7. The pressure brought to bear on the Iraqis to accept a compromise their failure *as yet to obtain any satisfaction from the League, although they have an apparently foolproof legal case, and the way in which the Persians, with a weak case, have been able to prevent a reference of the dispute to the Hague Court or even up to the present^to a Committee of Jurists, do not inspire much confidence in League procedure in cases of this kind and the progress of this dispute will no doubt be borne in mind in connection with the question of the Persian claim to Bahrein being referred to the League.

No. 41. ri came to see me yesterday evening and related with some heat difficulties which he had experienced in Rome over frontier dispute. He said tha.t everything was going well until Baron Alois! was appointed rapporteur. From that moment Baron Aloisi had simply constituted himself advocate of Persia for which Nuri understood he was reaping a substantial quid pro _quo. He had been told that Persian government had already placed orders for more men-of-war and some merchant vessels with Italy and had promised to send students of all kinds military, naval, commercial, engineering etc. to Italy. He also said that there was no doubt that Baron Aloisi was aiming at substituting Italy for (treat Britain as trustee member of conservancy board. Nuri confessed to great disappointmenr at failure o± the ..runcil to tackle Persians more firmly about their recent behaviour. ibe way he looked at it was this. Iraq had been given as her inheritance a portion of the old* Turkish Empire and before she allied for membership of the League of Nations the greatest care had been taken to obtain a legal definition of all Iraq's boundaries with her neighbours as without this she would not have been eligiole. What had Persia done but to throw down a challenge to the League by transgressing on l and water a boundary which has been legally laid down in 1914, she had built pos ts of Iraqi ten territory, endangered •f h p7 2 . tne saiety of international shipping in Iraqi waters and had denied at this late hour validity of a treaty more than eighty 3 /Cai o old on WiiicL cue froncier had been based and which she nad 01 ten invoked in tne past in her own favour. Iraq asked the League to decide validity or otherwise of this frontier. Surely that was not an unreasonable request as if the two neighbours could not agree about their frontier bloodshed was certain to occur sooner or laterc It was to avoid bloodshed in the settlement of disputes that the League had been created. Yet the Italian, rapporteur was constantly pressing him to side track 'legal' question and agree to the principle of alteration in the existing regulations in Shaft-el-Arab in favour of Persia, This was grossly unfair and no Iraqi government could agree go it. All the Iraqi government wanted was that the League should give a juridical decision on tne question 01 the fiontiei at goi obtaining an advisory opinion from the Hague Goal c and ne appealed to me to request His Majesty's Government wlio were so interested in peace on Perso-Iraqi frontier to facilitate ‘promulgation of this decision. After hut not before this was done Iraq would be prepared to discuss with Persia other matters, such as navigation in Ghatt-el-Arab, arising out oi this dispute.

IMMEDIATE. - - My telegram No._91 to_Rome (of February 11th: Perso-Iraqi frontier dispute). Confidential. Mr. Edmonds, who has just arrived from Rome states that Nuri, before leaving for Bagdad on February 10th, suggested to Baron Aloisi that he could keep in contact with Muzahim el Pachachi, who is remaining in Rome. This arrangement appears extremely dangerous. In view of most unsatisfactory Italian attitude, it would clearly be better that all conversations between Rapporteur and Iraqis re should be completely suspended until they can be sumed with Nuri himself, when Iraqi government have had time to consider their future policy in the light of the reaction of the Persian government to Nuri’s proposals to Ala (see my telegram February 2nd) to Rome). That reaction is in any case likely to he delayed so long as Persians think they can obtain better terms by continuing Roman negotiations. So long moreover as Muzahim remains in Rome there is always danger of Italians trying to commit some new scheme which would only further complicate situation. It seems most desirahle therefore the.o 4* tiis Iraqi government should on some pretext -remove Musahim from Home with the least possible delay 0 unless you see strong objection you snould give hum coniidential advice on above lines, informing him tnat Mr, Edmonds entirely agrees« Miw Edmonds has explained that Nuri desires advice of His Majesty’s Government as to reply to be returned to suggestions made to him by Rapporteur at his final interview.

He considered that he and tlio Italian Goverriment had doth heen treated somewhat cavalierly by Nuri Pa^hlT In the first place the latter had re fused to sign the ureatjy of friendship which had been discussed for some months past between the two countries* There were some few outstanding points but these offered no real difficulty* He feared that the cause of Nuri's reluctance was that he was en deavouring to combine the signature of the treaty with the dis pute and was waiting to see whether he 3 the rapporteur, adopted a line favourable to Iraq, in the latter before declaring himself ready to sign the treaty 0 I replied that I felt sure that this was a complete mis understanding of Nuri 5 s attitude 0 He had been inspired as re gards the treaty question with the highest motives and had only been afraid that it might be saicL if he had signed, thao the th 0 two questions had been linked up and that the treaty wap -price he had paid for the report on the dispute* Baron Aloisi ClUb sworad that Nuri had already explained this but rcoaliy it was quite untenable for the treaty was merely a UUcy of +r+e.*. ship., no concessions wsro made to Italy and U had be-n d..s cussed long before the dispute broke out. He therefore begged me to do all I could to help him on this subject in which, he 1 ini himself was greatly interested. J\.S &lt;* o o « c- • said. Signor Musseldo As I have already stated In a telegram I cannot help feeling that Nurl's scruples on this point are exaggerated and that no harm could really take place at Geneva as a result of the signing of the treaty here at the earliest possible moment. Baron Aloisi continued that Nuri Pasha had now gone awtp/o He had certainly left in charge the minister here out the latter really knew nothing about the question. The Persian minister for Foreign Affairs who was also here was becoming restive and said that he could not remain indefinitely at the beck and call of Nuri. He therefore was equally anxious to disappear, Baron Aloisi accordingly asked whether 1 could not be helpful and arrange for the Iraqi minister to act according to my advice. I replied that this was asking a great deal 1 I had no authority to take any such action. I added that as regards my Government, we were somewhat concerned by the fact that during the negOuia- tious no attention ha-d been given to tne draft oripai- tite convention providing for the navigation of the river. This convention had been drawn up with (meat care and its drafting had taken considerable time. It allowed Persian participation in the arrangements for the navi gation. The convention had in 1932 been presented to th 3 Persian Government in Tehran and had been provision ally accepted by the Shah himself. Unfortunately the Shah's acceptance had oeen latei wiuhdrawn. Nurio•«.mam3 , Nuri Pasha had recently again offered this convention to the Persian government if the latter would recog nise the validity of the treaties hut so far had again met with a refusal. It was this that rendered the situation particularly difficult. I really had no authority to make any suggestions hut I wondered whether it might he possible for him as rapporteur to propose to the Persians that the , convention to which I referred should he put into force at once® The Persians on their side would have to agree to the legal questions being referred to the court either in two stages by means of the committee of jurists of which he himself had spoken earlier or direct„ I felt that it might also he possible for Iraq to consent that the convention should continue in force whatever the decision of the 3 onrt might he.

BY TELEPHONE. i\io Your telegrams Uos. 96 and 37 (of February 13th - Perso-Iraqi frontier dispute). There is no objection to your communicating confidentially to Baron Alois! draft text of tripartite Conservancy Board Convention as given in Persia print of June 7th last, section 1 (omitting covering despatch etc,)* You should explain, however, that this draft differs in one or two minor particulars from draft communicated to Persian Government in 1932 and is subject to further modifications to meet certain new technical points which have recently been under consideration 0 2, But apart from grave practical difficulties of putting this, or any other new arrangements for administra tion of waterway, into force immediately, whole basis ox draft tripartite convention was that it should be an alt ernative to the modification of the frontier which the Persians desire; and while it would be eminently suitable as a.ffording a solution of the practical dinicultles cx the situation a fter question of the frontier has been settled in one way or another. His Majesty*s Government consider that it would be most inequitable that the Iraqis Should be asked to make to Persia the very considerable concessions2 . as concessions which it re^rr^c-pn+o (^, ^presents (since it in effect gives Persia, equal rights ¥&lt;ith t n i &gt; tv D , , _ ir&amp;q - la the c ontrol of the waterway) m advance of any settlement of the juridical gues^on -t present in dispute, i, e , that of the validity of the ' “ frontier itself. 5. Statement in paragraph 5 of your telegram No, 96 (of February 15th) that Null's recent offer to Ala had met with a is ? so far as I am aware, inaccurate« There is ev ’ sry indiea tion that only reason why Persians are hesitating to accept Nurihs very reasonable offer is that they hope, . 1 th the help ol bhe Italians, to be able to extract better terms and in fact to obtain from the Iraqis all the practical concessions which the latter offered them in return for Persian recognition of existing frontier without having to give that recognition, 4 £ As has been repeatedly explained, arrangements for Persian participation in the administration of the Shatt, such as those contained in the draft tripartite convention, can only appropriately form, part of a permanent and not of a provisional solution. But if Persians were prepared, in return, for tripartite Conservancy Board Convention to accept a reference of the question of the validity of the frontier to The Hague Court and to agree at once to abide by the eventual decision of the Court, it might be possible lor His Majesty's Government to persuade the Iraqi Government to agree to ^he^ conclusion oi me trips rtm f-e Con.

I have carried out your instructions and Baron Aloisi can be under no illusions as to views of His rajesty's Government regarding his own proposals. 2. Situation has developed here in the last two days, R'uri is leaving for Bagdad on February 10th and present phase is therefore over. Paragraphs below attempt to summarise the position here as I see it. 3. Background is as follows:- Iraq, considers dispute to be of purely juridical nature and to be concerned with frontier line alone (she complains that a long established arrangement has been violated). She wishes juridical issue decided once and for all. Italian rapporteur, assisted if not indeed inspired by the League Secretariat takes the view that in addition to juridical issue over the frontier there is also the question of participation both provisional and permanent of Persia in administration of Shatt-el-*rat to be considered; need of, if not right to, such participation arising from the^ fact that Persia (a) has recognised frights of navigation, (b) owns left bank and (c) has sovereignty in certain plages over parts of the river itself. In addition His majesty s Government, owing to their preponderant shipping interests, desire to participate in management of river. * ^ 4.it.Iluiri has shewn hii^^pif 1 i o ' '^ no l ess opposed to Baron n ■^•i proposals than have we ourselves and to any suggestion « t ' beyond arrangements to avoid frontier incidents h. e has st^H' t e has „„ instructions. in i»t,r,i„ Baron il0151 ^ lie could not but call mv attpn+ior, + t x my aitentl0n to what he termed Nuri's intransigeanoe and though I did my Best to di L teciPj begin to regard iraois ssuade him he nay, with impatienee, Nuri's so called intransigeance arises from hio ^ ri r,^ + 6 curses iron ms insistence on obtaining submission of dispute to juridical settlement while rejecting all proposals for Persian participation in river administration oiil such settlement Is obtained. He has written a letter to rapporteur to this effect. Baron nloisi is equally anxious to bring dispute before The Hague but his difficulty is to offer some inducement to Persians to agree to The Hague, it being j common ground that Persia oannot be forced against her will to the Permanent Court. Baron Alois! hopes that his draft proposals may constitute this inducement* When I pointed out to him that means employed were entirely disproportionate to the end and would lead to grave practical difficulties he stated that he would be ready to make substantial modifications in these proposals; I fea^-, however, it will be almost impossible to shift him from principle that some representation should now be given to Persia on river administration, whether by a mixed commission or otherwise. He told me for instance that he was prepared to extend membership of proposed commission to five so as to include British representative. (Your view that Italians intend to reserve one place for an Italian member is there foie almost certainly correct;. Further that he uouid oe prepared uO propose that Commission should only function, if and when incident arose or a modification of exis ting naviga tion was introduced ti31 &gt; ;° WM t T Sian ralSeS in MS view' Basra Harbour Board could continue to function practically un- affected. Alternatively he suggested that it might he uossihie to grant Persia a representative on Basra Harbour Board as it is constituted today. But he complained that he could not put forward any of these suggestions owing to Nuri's intransigeance. iiaron iiloisi appealed to me to endeavour to obtain some o.ihiinution of t!uri s rigid attitude so that when latter returned heic negotiations could continue with some hope of success under Article 11 which provided for a settlement by conciliation. It is, I think quite true that Baron Aloisi had hope that his proposals for a temporary arrangement might in the course of time become permanent and perhaps he even believes that these ■ .proposals will render any early decision on the validity of the [treaties unnecessary. I therefore pointed out to him that it was unfair to expect Iraq to agree that the question of sovereignty over the river should remain in abeyance* This question ought to be solved within a reasonable time. If I remember right even Barcelona convention mentioned a state of emergency which gave a state exercising sovereignty on the river the rir.ht to certain definite and exceptional action. But I will not repeat my conversation with him in full since I am sending record hy Mr. idmonds vdio leaves for London on February 10th. I must add. however that I touched on the right which Iraq might have to exercise appeal to Article 15 of the covenant if Persia .refused to acknowledge frontier. 6 . As I have stated Baron Aloisi is inspired to some extent oy League Secretariat which naturally favours system of inter nationalisation. Secretariat consider dispute is solely between -ersia and Iraq and are not inclined to admit any claim by His Majesty'sMajesty's Government to a special position. They hold that ¥/e should he satisfied provided adequate arrangements are made for maintenance of navigation of river. 7. Signor Filotti of Secretariat who is helping rapporteur over this question came to see me yesterday. In the course of long discussion I was unahle to induce him to depart from thesis that Persia was entitled to have some say in provisional administration of the river. Signor Pilotti made one observa tion which seemed to me of great importance. He suggested that perhaps Persia might agree to go to permanent court on the question of validity of treaties and simultaneously to ask that the court should lay down what administrative rights in the river accrue to her from those treaties and to request the court to frame regulations to implement such rights, if any. Baron Aloisi has not mentioned this suggestion to me hut Signor Pilotti's ideas have the knack of cropping up later m a concrete and legal shape. 8 . To sum up. (a) I do not think Baron Aloisi will yield on point that rovisional arrangements must provide for Persian particip n. administration of navigation of tnc n/er. 4 - ' * q q r neptarce ahovs he (h) In order to obtain ±rah s accept . n .a -p-pe^s Persians to withdraw their troops quid he prepared to press rex . _ x reference to court of question ol o 1914 line and consent to reierenae slidity of boundaries.

I believe this is likely to make the greatest appeal to Persia and to the rapporteur. 9. The whole question is obviously complex in view of interests involved and I would suggest it should be discussed in detail with Mr. lb mends on his return to London and Puri Pasha consulted in Bagdad.

Matter will be discussed with Mr, Edmonds on arrival, *t 1 must once express my astonishment at the way in which ron tdoisi and apparently the League Secretariat have mis« ■presented or misunderstood the situation. They appear to ve completely ignored the fact that for many years Trap has icwn complete readiness to meet Persian wishes for share in )ntrol of waterway, and that in 1932 a very carefully worked it draft Conservancy Board Convention, which had taken many isrs to prepare, and v/hi ch, unlike Baron Aloisi’s hastily jvised and ill-considered scheme, took full account of all le technical and local complexities of the situation, was 'esented to the Persian Government by Nuri Pasha himself in nnran and that the Shah provisionally accepted a. settlement i these lines. Question of participation of Persia in dninistration of Shatt-el-Arab is therefore not - s,s suggested i paragraph 3 of your telegram - a, new one, which Baron .oisi has just discovered, but one which Iraqis have always aen prepared to settle in a. generous spirit taking account : the pra.cticsl difficulties of the situation# 2. Incidentally Baron Aloisi’s references to Persia's a sting rights in waterway (see paragraph 1 of your telegram ). 80 (of February 6th) and paragraph 3 of your telegram 39 (of February 9th)) seem somewhat paradoxical since those35 2, those rights exist only in virtue of international instru- ments validity of which Persia disputes and which Baron Alois! has said that he is therefore unwilling to accept as 'basis for any ueniporary arrangement (see paragraph 3 of yorr telegram No® 67 (of January 31st))* Moreover Baron Alois! appears to have picked out from those instruments only pro visions favouring Persia, while Ignoring the much more ex tensive rights which Iraq acquired thereby c 3® What Iraqis object to is nob Persian participation x x in arrangements for administration of the Shatt - as they have made clear by recent offer to revert to 1932 proposals, (see my telegrams Nos 0 73 and 79 (of February 2nd and 4th)) - but fact that Persians 5 having refused to accept these arrangements on basis of maintenance of legal fron tier, are now trying s apparently with assistance of Italy and League Secretariat, to invoke question of Persian par- ticipation in administration cl Shatt with a view to pre judging juridical Question, which they themselves havo raised, of legal validity of instruments on which frontier is based. Iraqis obviously cannot lend themselves to this manoeuvre« 4. You should be guided by above considerations in any further conversations you may have witu Baion Aloioi, strongly emphasising fact that very carefully worked out draft Conservancy Board Convention designed to meet specie practical difficulties of complicated situation m me o-a x- -hnfnrp the Persian Government by whom it mo has long been before th^ i - - v 0 -r+Pd m 1 Q 32 and to whom it was lecently provisionally acceptcc. n--- ,, T . p„ r v, fl Persians have appaxentlj again offered by Nun Pasha, po. 1ll+ion solely +n nrrevt this practical solution hitherto refused to accep. mi[nesting tneir territorial demands, should now have to make tuis practical concession while the territorial Question still remains unsettled. 5. In view of Nuri Pasha's offer at the Council on January 21st to discuss with Persia any difficulties to firm basis for negotiations should have been established by settlement of juridical issue, and of his more recent offer to revert to 1932 proposals, accusation that he is being intransigent is of course entirely unjustified.

The Prime Minister on my advice drafted original in structions to Nuri in such a way as to give him no authority for discussion in any change in existing arrangements before juridical question was decided, Iraqi Cabinet have therefore been much perturbed by Nuri’s recent telegram which suggests that he is discussing temporary modus vivendi on terms of which they have no cognisance. This is the reason why Nuri has received peremptory orders to return immediately to Bagdad without signing Italian Treaty, I consider Baron Aloisi's proposal particularly dangerous as it fits in with rumours which have reached me from other sources that Italians are anxious oo placaoe the Shah with a view to inducing Persians to order ad ditional men-of-war from Italy also that Italians nave ambitions for adopting the role oi mediator in u-e o_.c u ho Arab which they might try to secure by suosuimtin 0 It 3 for Great Britain as neutral state which would provide third member on Conservancy Board, I am convinced that British as well as Iraqi mterems demand that no alteration of existing authority or modifi cation of existing regulations in Shatt-el-Arab should oe agreed to at this stage. ^Uyhavoida-nce^of''incidents is at last Council session regaronn^ = on -j Ur i C Lical issues, all that is required Penarng a deysio.-^^ Goveramenc.

I informed him of the substance of my conversation yesterday evening with Baron Aloisi and explained to him the advantages which I saw personally in the latter’s proposal as regards a request to the Council for a few jurists to advise him, before formulating his report, on the legal questions involved in the dispute. I was glad to find that no mention had been made of internationalisation during my conversation with Baron Aloisi. 2. Nuri Pasha said that internationalisation had been mentioned to him by Signor Guarnaschelli, but he had explained to the latter that this proposal was quite impossible of acceptance by Iraq since the Shatt-el-Arab constituted Iraq’s sole access to the sea. He believed that Signor Guarnaschelli had taken and appreciated the point. He had also seen Baron Aloisi, but he could not say that he had had a very favourable impression of the interview. Baron Aloisi seemed more inclined to talk about the proposed treaty between Iraq and Italy than to deal with the dispute. Nuri Pasha was a little afraid that the Italians might be tempted to utilise this dispute for putting pressure on Persia, which had terminated the contracts of certain Italian officers. 3. I told him that Baron Aloisi gave me the impression last night of wishing to deal with the matter quite impartially. It was true that the Italian temperament would be likely to confuse the treaty and the dispute, but I did not necessarily attach much importance to this. Nuri Pasha said that if he found that Baron Aloisi was treating the dispute reasonably, he would personally have -nn ntnAPtirm t.n sicminp' the treatv after certain small outstanding points had been for this action.

Baron Aloisi’s proposal greatly increases my concern at Italian attitude on this question. Meat is before the League is a complaint by Iraq that Persia is not merely challenging but actively violating long established frontier arrangements. Italians appear to ignore this plain fact and have persisted both at Geneva end Pome in suggesting, pending a solution of the legal question which may he indefinitely delayed, temporary arrangements which would give practical satisfaction to Persia only. They seem in fact to be endeavouring, in guise of a provisional arrangement, to set aside existing instruments before they have been proved invalid, in order to gratify the ns of the party which is challenging them. 2.

As one of main Persian contentions is tnat Persian ships are not bound by regulations issued by Port Directorate, Persians could be relied upon constantly to appeal to new commission with a view to substitutins authority of latter for that of former.

Request by the Iraqi Government under Article 11, Paragraph 2, of the Covenant of the League of Nations (continuation). Noury Pasha Said, representative of Iraq, and Mirza Seyed Bagher Khan Kazemi, representative of Persia, came to the Council table. M. Kazemi, Representative of Persia.—I should like to be allowed to add a few explanations to the considerations already submitted in the Persian Governmen s According to the Iraqi Government, the frontier indicated by the 1913 ro o ^ valid; moreover, it asserts that the part fixed by the Delimitation Commission 9 4 - be final. 1 1 Document C.22.M.10.1935.VII.Mv Government cannot accept this view. Our icasons foi this are extremely clear and simple The Acts invoked by Iraq extend from the Treaty of Erzerum to the Constantinople ProJ, and to the operations of the Delimitation Commission on the ground. I shall deal with these Acts one by one, beginning with the last. Firstly ■ The application of the 1913 line on the ground in 1914 was not complete, but was hampered by the opposition and resistance of the Ottomans The non-execution of a treaty b, one 1 of the contracting States gives the other State the right to regard that treaty as cancefej' A frontier can no doubt be fixed on the ground from place to place and final appropriations can be made as the operations proceed; but that is subject to the condition that the Act, Con. vention or arbitral award which determines the line is exactly and faithfully observed; this is a consequence of the principle of the indivisibility of the frontier. This essential principle was not respected owing to the resistance of the Ottomans, so that then occupations of territory cannot be adduced against Persia. Secondly: The 1913 line, on which the demarcation is based, is embodied in a Protocol signed bv the representatives of the two Empires and of two foreign Powers. But, as it constitutes the undertaking by which the territorial dispositions of the two Empires were modified, the approval of Parliament at that time required both by the Ottoman and Persian Constitutions, was necessary in the two Empires for the twofold validity of the agreement—firstly, in municipal law, and, secondly, as a consequence, in international law. Thirdly: It is vain for Iraq to object that the Constantinople Protocol of 1913 did not need to fulfil this condition of constitutional validity because, in virtue of the Teheran Agreement of jqij ) it was purely and simply the application of a previous Act, the Treaty of Erzerum, concluded at a*time when parliamentary approval could not be required, since no representative system existed. This argument is based on an insufficient analysis of the facts. The Teheran Protocol of 1911 refers, as regards the frontier-line, to what is described in the Protocol itself as the u so-caM Treaty of Erzerum of 1847 (1263 of the Hegira) ”. The Constantinople Protocol of 1913 takes as basis the Treaty which it intentionally calls in its own text “ the so-called Treaty of Erzerum of 1848 (1264 of the Hegira) ”. Between these two texts of 1847 and 1848 a profound divergence exists. The first, which was accepted by Persia, does not include the explanatory note granted to the Porte, 2 at its request, by the foreign Powers; the second, which was accepted by the Porte but not by Persia, included this explanatory note. Thus, the Treaty of Erzerum referred to by the Teheran Agreement does not satisfy the essential condition of any contract, which is that both parties should be in concordance on the same subject at the same time. It was only at Constantinople, at the seventeenth meeting of the Joint Commission of 1912, that, under the pressure of Russian influence, Persia accepted what is known as the 1848 text. At that moment agreement, previously non-existent, was achieved. But, at that moment, the Constitutions of both Empires required the approval of the Parliaments. Fourthly: This legislative acceptance was the more necessary inasmuch as, even if the Erzerum line had in due course become the subject of a regular agreement, the 1913 Protocol ought to have been submitted for the approval of both Parliaments. I should like to draw the Council’s attention to the substantial differences between the two lines^—the Erzerum line of 1848 and the Constantinople line of 1913. The Treaty of Erzerum does not say a word about giving to the Porte the whole of [the Shatt-al-Arab, in full sovereignty, as far as low-water mark on the Persian bank. It does not fix in direct, clear and categorical terms the frontier on the bank beyond the waters of the river; yet this should have been made quite explicit, in absolute and formal terms, if the intention were to depart from the fundamental principle of the equal sovereignty of the two riparians as far as the middle of the river. On the other hand, after having been careful to conclude with the Porte on the same day a Convention which in practice placed the administration of the river under her authority, although she was not a riparian, Great Britain did not hesitate, by a declaration dated July 29th, 1913, to remove the frontier expressly to the further bank. This declaration, for which she undertook to secure the acceptance of Persia, which, in this matter, was not a| free agent, was simply introduced into the Constantinople Protocol, of which it formed the essential text as regards e southern frontier. But this change was made without any attempt at harmony. The text, recopied as it stood,, bears the trace of this when it says, “ The frontier line established in this declaration is shown in red on the attached map ”, although, on this point, there no longer exists a 1 a era declaration but an agreement between four parties, neither is there any red line on a map, since the map referred to does not exist. These points of drafting would in themselves be sufficient to show that the 1913 text is not the application but the modification, by extension, of that of 1847, and even of that of 1848. o realise this, it is sufficient to read one after the other the two texts of 1847/1848, on the one clear ^ ^ 1913 tGXt ° n the when the contrast between the two will become sufficiently iinnn^dhWn 1 !* 31 haS gone 80 far beyond the 1848 line that it even proves in practice x-i bP 8- e orte was so little anxious for total sovereignty as far as the other ban into arrow r ^T n pi COm r i u S10 T er ’ the 1914 deli mitation took place, still refused to take it fefiniteffiTnfavo 1 r r nd a fo ™ ula which win leave the conflict open ”, he said. “ A decision of this ilfdhwTrP o bl tV° ° n ! °! t ? e £ arties would cause a renewal of friction ”, he added. In face _ ndifference on the part of the Ottomans, the frontier remained, after 1914, what it had been J document €.531(1) M. 2 4 2 ( I ).

Wilson, the second British Commissioner of S 14 ’ Jif 7 \ pl 7 e ui he fron 7Tj as far as the sea ' alon &amp; the mum aqua, in the middle of the channel. Tradition and old custom thus proved stronger than the new text How, then, can there be any question now of the simple application of the Erzerum line when the inconsistency between the two texts was such as to create a resistance which rendered whollv nugatory two texts entirely unconnected with the Treaty of Erzerum—namelv the Convention and Declaration of London of July 29th, 1913, between Great Britain and the Porte ? If you will now be good enough to turn from the river frontier to the land frontier you will find that the Constantinople Protocol also deprived Persia of extensive territories which were not affected by the Erzerum clauses. These territories have an approximate area of several thousand square kilometres. They include, inter alia, going from north to south, a fertile district traversed by the Sirvan, and then an oil-bearing region. This latter region, indeed, led to a curious reservation Article VII of the Constantinople Protocol of 1913 says that the concession granted by the Imperial Persian Government in 1901 to William Knox d’Arcy, and later ceded to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, 'shall remain to quote its actual words—“ in full and unrestricted force throughout the territories transferred by Persia to Turkey in virtue of the provisions of the present Protocol . . The text itself reveals its own significance. It does not merely delimit the frontier in virtue of the Erzerum Agreement; it goes far beyond the bounds of that Agreement by itself making transfers which, as you may judge, are of great—indeed, capital—importance. Thus, both on the river frontier and on the land frontier, very material changes were made in the boundaries, between 1847 and 1913, from the Erzerum Treaty to the Constantinople Protocol. They were not submitted to legislative sanction, as the law of the period required. Hence they have no more value in international law than in municipal law. It is therefore our right and duty to regard them as non-existent. Such was the situation when the great war broke out, even before the Delimitation Commission had completed its task. Despite her declared neutrality, Persia became the scene of hostilities. On the conclusion of peace, she joined the League as an original Member, with her frontiers as they then were, unchallenged by any State. Since then, she has not extended her territory by moving those frontiers. She cannot imagine that she will meet with a refusal to recognise the position as it existed when the 1913 Constantinople Protocol was drawn up, a position from which she was ousted by the proceedings of an irregular Commission which, in 1914, had not even succeeded in carrying out the whole of the juridically valueless mandate conferred upon it under a Convention that was invalid, since the consent of both parties, necessary for its conclusion, had never legally been secured. I would like to stress this point that, from 1847 to 1912, and then in 1913. the agreements necessary to modify the territorial situation were never concluded, because there was never any joint consent in the forms required by both municipal and international law between Persia and the Sublime Porte; it is self-evident that where there is no joint consent there can be no contract, either private or public. Persia has no intention of asking for a revision of existing treaties. That would lequne a special procedure which, in our case, it would be a grave mistake even to mention. Nor does Persia intend to demand abrogation of agreements she has signed in the past, V^ c . n though, should such agreements have been concluded, there would be numerous xeasons loi eir annulment. * . _ . Our purpose is merely to point out that, as between Persia and the Ottoman Empire, ere has never been that joint consent which is required, in accordance with the law in force a ■ e various periods, for the very existence of a contract. The Council will realise the importance o is s a e ment. It shows the real nature of Persia’s right which could never be affected by any acts—even freely undertaken—which have only the appearance of contracts. , In these circumstances, Persia cannot admit that her right should be con es e (1) To the application of the status quo existing before 1913 along her land frontier where the 1913 demarcation and its application in 1914 entailed grea ern or a to the transfer of points then in its occupation; . , rvUrWiP nf fhe (2) To equal sovereignty, on her water frontier over the river up to the mi Shatt-al-Arab, divided along the median line of the channel between e p Iraq and Persia. Along the land frontier you will have noticed that the 1913 Protocol disregards the E Treaty in arbitrarily taking the frontier along alignments other than all mountains and waterways, which mark the points from which Persian g y sllf time kept watch on raiding tribes. between the two riparian States, kesaii As for the water frontier, I should like to point out that, as prnialitv of the two both Members of the League, no other regime is applicable excep , , after passing sovereignties up to midstream, a solution of the problem w ^ c 15 a . ,1 twentieth despite unchallenged throughout the nineteenth century, it continued o su s retained the same the Constantinople Protocol.

There can be no question ^detracting from either the security or the prosperity of Iraq, or of hurting her pride. There are other States whose access to the sea consists of but a single river, of which they are not the only riparian country; this, however,has never been adduced as a reason for claiming full sovereignty over the whole course of the river to the sea Equality of sovereignty as between the two riparians can in no case threaten prosperity or the security of either. On the contrary, inequality, being an inadmissible privilege would involve a serious threat to security, prosperity an d even independence itself. Unless the freedom of the river is to become a vain word, and the honour of one of the riparians is to be injured and its independence threatened, it cannot be within the power of one State only to dictate to the other conditions and restrictions concerning the use of the waterway, and to subject that State to its regulations and, for their enforcement, to its authorities. Such action would place one of the riparians under the dependency of the other. _ _ This point can already be appreciated even now. By claiming that it is alone responsible for the conservancy work, Iraq has already, by its dredging, displaced the navigable channel; whole palm groves are disappearing, and as the river is progressively displaced towards the east, erosion of the eastern bank is eating into the property of Persian subjects. It is feared, so we understand, that Iraq might be paralysed by the division of the sovereignty over the river between the two riparian States, but it is not realised that the exclusive sovereignty of one State over the whole of the river is already affecting Persia’s interests—even her territorial interests. If, instead of having to deal with Iraq and the new Turkey after the disappearance of the Ottoman Empire, Persia had still to negotiate with the old Empire, I have no doubt that she would easily have secured an acknowledgment of the impossibility of claiming an alignment to which, from 1847 to 1912 and 1913, she never gave that consent which is necessary for the conclusion of an agreement. In any case, before its disappearance, the Ottoman Empire had never given its consent within the terms provided for by the Constitution, so that the intention necessary to confer binding force on the 1913 Protocol never took shape in the Ottoman Empire. In the circumstances, neither the new Turkey nor Iraq can claim the benefit of such an agreement; for they are faced with a dilemma. Either they are in the place and stead of the Ottoman Empire without being its successors, in which case they cannot retain the discretional}’ right of that Empire to take over as their own the agreement of 1913—which was nothing but a draft—by giving it the approval of the legislature which is necessary to give shape and form to the national will; or, on the contrary, the existence of their sovereignty where the Ottoman Empire formerly held sway is something more than a simple territorial coincidence independent of any personal tie, and involves a real personal continuity conferring upon them, as heirs, the rights and duties of the predecessor State. In that case, if we assume that the Ottoman Empire would— if stiE in existence—have retained discretion to take over the effects of the 1913 Protocol by a decision in accordance with its Constitution, its two successors, the new Turkey and Iraq, which are both of them sovereign States, could not exercise the same right by way of succession, for, under the terms of their sovereignty, each of them would be entitled to take, in so far as concerned itself, a decision contrary to that taken by the other, one taking over the Protocol and the other rejecting That would change the whole system of the alignment and so destroy the unity of the frontier, which is the condition of its fairness and logic. f J UC \ are reasons why Persia could not agree, in respect of her land frontier, to a repudiation o the rights she held prior to the delimitation of 1913-14, and, in respect of her river frontier, o he rejection of equality of sovereignty for both riparian States in favour of the absolute sovereignty of one. Having been accused of overstepping boundaries which were neither validly nor fairly drawn, Fersia protests that she does not deserve that reproach, and, in order to remove all doubts, declares f a 1 • 1! yf m P or an t for the alignment to be clearly defined by common agreement between the wo curing and friendly States in accordance with the underlying principles of the Covenant, of mpmhpr^h- 6611 ofthe League from its inception, Persia is conversant with the duties whfrh^Q J, a and &gt; actuated by the legitimate desire to maintain intact that territorial integrity resnert off w?p t c eed Y V 16 Lea P J e ’ she seeks nothing which is not strictly in keeping with the p Snrti arp regu J arl y concluded &gt; tk e provisions of international law, and justice and honour, nreciselv inform^ Tfl^ 10118 t0 whlch 1 . should ha ve confined myself had I not been more Since I wns ahlp vpqIp ri e reas °U s on which the opinion of the Iraqi representative is based would ask the Connrii + r ^ ° rea lse ’ as I listened to him, the nature of his main objections.

Thus, the instrument known as the Treatv of Erzerum is a valid text of which the others represent merely the execution, by fixing a frontier hne, which, it appears, gave rise between 1847 and 1914 to none but natural difficulties th° nnlv difficulties to which the Iraqi representative has thought it necessary to allude. He adds moreovej that ratification by a plenipotentiary without power to ratify and'the conclusion, contrary to the Constitution of an agreement so important as a change in the territorial situation possess bind “ force, since there would otherwise no longer be any security in international relations b But, in support of this contention, he appeals in vain to texts, to circumstances to facts to principles; none of these support him. Then he goes into the history of the frontier Although he claims that the Persians had no right to the eastern bank, he is obliged to admit bv referent to the Treaty of 1639, demanded by the Turks, that the Persians had advanced as far as Basra In order to explain how it is that, after waiting for seventy years, the frontier had not vet been fixed, he refers to the natural obstacles, but makes no mention of the psychological obstacles the importance of which the Persian memorandum had emphasised by very definite quotations from the members of the Delimitation Commission. The Treaty of Erzerum prepared by the Mediating Courts, was to be exchanged, accepted, signed and ratified. The Porte having incorpo rated 111 it the explanatory note of which Persia had no cognisance, and could not have had cognisance, the Treaty was not signed—at all events as the Porte understood that act—on pain of being declared null and void. It is not merely a question of a treaty ratified by a plenipotentiary exceeding his powers, but of one that was so ratified without having been signed. According to Iraq, the Porte alone had the right to avail itself of Persia’s non-acceptance of the explanatory note. That is a mistake. After declaring that such acceptance was to be a condition sins quci fion the two parties never reached the stage of joint consent. That is a matter, not of nullity, which is relative, but of non-existence, which is absolute. No confirmation could take place; no confir mation did take place on either side. When the parties referred to the instrument known as the Treaty of Erzerum, which had been concluded partly at Erzerum, in 1847, without the assent of the Porte, and partly at Constantino fie, in 1848, without the assent of Persia, they each interpreted the words “ Treaty of Erzerum ” in a different way. Nor is the Protocol of Teheran of 1911, which is to all appearances absolutely regular in form—since the two signatures appear on the same date beneath the same text—immune from this same objection of divergency. As the representative of Iraq very truly said, treaties are dated according to their signature. Now, it is quite true that, in the Protocol of Teheran, the Treaty of Erzerum is described as the instrument “ known as the Treaty of Erzerum ” of 1847. But how is it that, in the Protocol of Constantinople of November 17th, 1913, it is described by Russia as the “ treaty of 1848 known as the Treaty of Erzerum ” ? That is the key to the misunderstanding. For Persia, the Treaty is dated 1847; for the Porte, it is dated 1848. For Persia, the Treaty consists of the text without the explanatory note; for the Porte, it consists of the text plus the explanatory note. Even at Teheran the two neighbouring nations did not agree upon a single text. It was only later, between August 2nd and 9th, 1912, at the last meeting but one of the Mixed Commission of Constantinople, that joint consent was reached. Our memorandum refers to that text. It stresses its importance. Up to that moment, Persia had not accepted the instrument known as the Treaty of Erzerum, and up to that moment the Porte had not accepted it either. If one waits, as one must, for the conclusion of the Treaty until the moment when there is joint consent, the real date of the Treaty described in turn as of 1847 an d 1848 is neither 1847 nor 1848, but 1912—and even then without ratification by the executive, notwithstanding Article 9 of the Treaty, and, moreover, without legislative approval, despite the explicit and absolute provisions of the Constitution. The representative of Iraq said yesterday that it would have been necessary to have a clause containing the explicit reservation that the Treaty must be in conformity with the Constitution, in order that the assent of Parliament might be taken as embodying the will of the State. I was not expecting such a statement, which is absolutely contrary to the doctrine and piactice o contemporary law. The representative of Iraq then hastened to add that the Persian Parhamen , which was in abeyance, could not be consulted, as it was not sitting. But the Constitution remame intact, with this vital article, embodied in the amendment of I9 0 7» the fundamenta ases of the Constitution cannot be suspended The Mejlis, which was dissolved in December 1911, me again in December 1914. Iraq replies that it was impossible to wait foi three years. y sue haste, when, as I have shown, this period of waiting, dating from 1847, amounted to near y seven y years ? Nor must it be forgotten that the same rule was necessary for the embodiment of tne Ottoman national will and that the Ottoman Parliament in this case was not m abeyance, Persian Parliament. And these observations, which would appear to retain their full force if, as Iraq alleges, the Protocol of 1913 and the froces-verbaux of 1914 were mere y a —two stages removed, moreover—of Erzerum, possess even greater importance w F , that, under the Protocol of 1913, Persia suffered severe territorial losses. e +0 London of July 29th, 1913, is a proof of those losses. I regret that there is no dwell on that point. I must go on to the second part of my explanations. TJxc K.'ivcv The Iraqi representative said yesterday that the frontier could ^ bank Certain texts, which are, however, becoming rarer and rarer, do p ace e o ^ ver n but that is quite exceptional, in virtue of a derogation, *k e ^ j aw Hfre doubtful A ✓NT.

Such a boundary must be proved; it cannot be assumed, h , of doubt the boundary line will be the middle of the river bed . or the thalweg.” r. purposes of such proof, the Erzerum text is manifestly inadequate. The Iraqi representative»!' in vain to make good the manifest inadequacy of its terms by stressing the fact that, in 18=0 ? frontier—so he alleges—was fixed by joint agreement at the bank. The assertion that 5 agreement existed is categorically denied. A memorandum from the two members of th Commission—British and Russian—on December 17th, 1851, states that they cannot overcoJ “ the difficulties arising out of the conflicting claims in regard to Muhammara ”, and that “ noZ of the common frontier has yet been delimited That assuredly cannot be the agreement regard^ the Treaty of Erzerum by the voluntary execution of its clauses to which the Iraqi representaZ referred yesterday, and still less can it be that definite, categorical and explicit formula require by the accepted rules for the interpretation of treaties in order to eliminate doubt, whk is inadmissible in ordinary law. On the contrary, the history of the water frontier shows that it is in flagrant disagreement with the letter of Erzerum and with established practice, that in view of the Ottoman indifference to exclusive sovereignty from bank to bank, the Declaration of London of July 29th, 1913, should have handed over the whole of the river to the Porte only to place it under 'the exclusive authority of another nation. Nevertheless, Persia, if it were a matter of accepting the internationalisation of the Shatt-al-Arab, might reply that that internationalisation presupposes equal sovereignty over the two halves of the river for each riparian State. Iraq had not been bom when the delegate of Persia, never questioning this river regime for the Shatt-al-Arab, asked at the Barcelona Conference that it should be extended to the Tigris. The notion of exclusiveness, of river privilege which was unknown to the Ottoman Empire but by which Iraq is now obsessed, is not in keeping with freedom of communications, which is one of the principles of the Covenant. The Iraqi repre. sentative boasted yesterday of the excellence of the regulations and of the Iraqi control of the river However well organised that control may be, it is none the less clear that it is unilateral. It applies moreover, not only to merchantmen, but also to warships. To place the warships of one riparian State under the unilateral and exclusive supervision of the other, in a river common to both is prejudicial to the dignity of that State and to respect for its sovereignty—in a word, it is inadmissible. The representative of Iraq thought fit, in conclusion, to ask the Council that, pending the delimitation, by a legal act, of the frontier between Iraq and Persia, that frontier should remain as it now exists according to Iraq’s contention. My Government cannot agree to that. It is not in keeping with the general principles of law, with the nature of the Council’s powers, with the character of the question submitted to you, with the fact that Persia became a Member of the League before Iraq, that the Council should be asked provisionally to adjudicate in favour of the claims of Iraq. . P^r^ia entered the League in order to maintain, on a legal basis, territorial integrity and political m ependence, she cannot agree that, on the inadmissible basis of alleged conventions, notone o v ich embodies agreement freely constituted between two national wills regularly constituted, e exercise of her sovereignty should be impeded, restricted or disturbed bv a claim which is Covemit 0mSIT1, excludes all compromise and which is contrary to all the principles of the .

I shall take account of the observations offered by my colleagues and will consult with he Secretary-General as to the date on which I am to report.I a s r* Q /32/34) gs^O rliiAax pho?;ti .ih dispotk. The Persian Minister called on me this morning on his return from Geneva, to discuss this question. After a long and slightly inaccurate account of what had nassed at Geneva. Ala renewed the appeal., which he had already twice made to the Secretary of State and developed to Mr. Bterndale Bennett at Geneva, that His Majesty’s Government should persuade the Iraqi Government to agree to some icind of compromise. Ala explained that the two countries were really most anxious to reach an agreement, and that very little divided them. As regards the Shatt~el~Arab, he realised that His Majesty’s Government had an interest in the question owing to their treaty arrangements with the Iraqis for the passage of their warships through these waters But this could easily be met on the lines which he had suggested and developed to Mr. Sterndale Bennett at Geneva. The two parties to the dispute were now about to discuss the whole question with the Italian rapporteur in Rome. Sir E. Drummond was familiar with League procedure and experienced in the arte of conciliation. Hie Majesty’s Government held a very special position in Iraq and their advice would certainly be listened to. Gould not Sir E. Drummond be instructed to urge the Iraqis to agree to some kind of friendly settlement. 2. I asked Ala whether in making this appeal he was acting on specific instructions from his Government or whether he was acting on his own initiative. He did not directly answer this question, but implied that he was merely following up the action which he had already been instructed to take. 3. I then reminded Ala of what had passed during his conversations with the Secretary of State and with Mr. oterndale BennettBennett. I said that, speaking quite frankly, it eestned to ffle that the Persian (iovernment had adopted a courae which made any compromise at this stage quite out of the question. The Persian Oovernment had apparently come to the conclusion that they did not like the frontier which had been delimited in 1914, and that they had a strong case in equity for asking for it to he revised. This was quite intelligible. But instead of seeking some such revision by agreement, they had taken the line that the international instruments on which this frontier was based, and to which this country had been a oarty. were legally invalid and of no effect. They had thus raised a juridical question with far-reaching implications, and now that this question had been raised it was essential that it should be disposed of, and settled one way or another, before any progress could be made. If the validity of frontiers set up by ancient treaties and observed for many years were to be called in question in this manner, there would be no end to the international complications which would follow. The Persians had in fact raised a legal spectre which must be laid before a other questions could be discussed. It was for this reason that Mr. Eden had emphasised in his opening speech before the Council the jur'idical character of the question at issue, and I could say quite definitely that in the view of His Majesty’s Government there could be no basis for negotiation until the juridical question of the legal validity of the instruments on which the present frontier was based had been disposed of. 4. Secondly, the Persian Government, being dissatisfied with the present frontier, had taken what seemed to me the very illadvised line of treating the frontier as though it did not exist. They had not only disregarded Iraqi regulations in the Shatt, with consequent serious danger to navigation, taken the law into their own hands on the land frontier and established73 6 . established police posts well within Iraqi territory - a fact which had been clearly established (Ala did not attempt to deny any of this). Whatever might be the rights and wron s of the present frontier* it seemed to me* again speaking quite frankly that the Persian tactics in denying the legal validity of the frontier and in treating it unilaterally as though it were not there, had been most unfortunate. Ala did not attempt to dispute this statement, hut still pressed that we should urge the Iraqis to compromise. 5. X replied that the Iraqis had to my knowledge made the most generous offers to the Persians with a view to meeting the practical difficulties which ,&lt;ere no doubt at the bottom of the Persian dissatisfaction at the existing frontier. They had for instance, proposed a Conservancy Board Convention which would put the whole of the gh&amp;tt- e l~Arab under the control of a Qoint body on which Persia would have equal renresentation with Iraq. When the draft of this agreement had been submitted to Teymourtaehe in 1932, the Persian Government had seemed quite ready to accept a solution on these lines, which it seemed to me would give them all they could reasonably ask for. By refusing such a solution it seemed to me that the Persians were in danger of sacrificing the substance for the shadow. Moreover, the Iraqis were known to be willing to reach a generous agreement with the Persians over other outstanding questions on the frontier, and in particular to c onlude a Bon Voisinage agreement on the lines of the similar agreements which had workea so well in other neighbouring countries. I felt sure therefore that once the legal question had been disposed of, the Persians would find the Iraqis very ready to meet them half way. I repeated that until the legal question which the ersians themselves had raised w'as settled, it aeemed to us could be no foundation fox* any agreement.6 . Ala was obviously disappointed with my attitude, but I doubt whether he expected anything else. The interview was long and quite friendly and Ala said a great deal besides the above? which X have not thought it necessary to record* (Signed) a, w. HMD EL.

Object of tactics suggested to Nuri would be to take utmost advantage of present mood of Persians and to make it easier for them eventually to accept 1914 line without undue loss of face, or, alternatively, if Persian Government still remain obstructive, to place Iraqi Government in strongest possible position before the Council.

Your telegram No. 67 (of January 51st - Perso-Iraqi frontie r di sput e ) 0 Confidential. Nuri Pasha arrived here on evening of January 51st and leaves on morning of February 4'th probably returning to Rome. In course of long interview at Foreign Office this afternoon in which he asked for views of His Majesty’s Government on whole question, he was given advice on lines of paragraphs 2 and 4- of my telegram No. ^62 _( of January 50th). It was then pointed out to Nuri Pasha that Persians might not unnaturally anticipate that Iraqis, if they v/on their case would adopt an uncompromising attitude. This fear would no doubt encourage Persians to be as obstructive as possible e If, hov/ever, Iraqis could make it clear at once that their previous offers to meet Persians half-way in overcoming practical difficulties of the situation (cf. paragraph 4 of my telegram No&lt;&gt; 50 (of January 25th)) were still open, Persians, «*■— — who seem to have been somewhat shaken by the reception of their case at Geneva, might be willing to accept the substance thus offered them and abandon their pursuit of the shadow, while Iraqis would greatly strengthen their own position at Geneva. There is, in fact, some reason to believe that the Persians are beginning to realise that they made a bad tactical blunder in ever raising the purely juridical question of the validity of the2, the 1913-1914 frontier settlement, and it may be that if advantage were taken of their present somewhat nervous and uneasy mood to offer them immediate conclusion of three agreements proposed in 1932, i.e. Conservancy Board Convention, an agreement regarding Transferred Territories Oil Field Royalties, and a bon voisinage agreement, they might be ready to settle on these lines. Until satisfactory agreement was reached Iraqis would of course have to reserve all their rights as regards frontier question, which could however perhaps be settled eventually, once immediate causes of friction were thus disposed of, by some form of re-definition exactly following definition of Delimitation Commission of 1914, to apply of course to Shatt-el-Arab as well as to land frontier.. Settlement on these lines would be greatly to advantage of Iraqis who would thus secure much needed Persian co-operation in conservancy of Shatt-el-Arab waterway system, and 'would lose little or nothing either as regards oil royalties (where future developments are uncertain) or as regards land frontier ciontrol.

During his visit to Foreign Office to-day Nuri Pasha seemed much concerned by pressure which Italians were exercising upon him to sign Treaty of Friendship immediately. They had continually reverted to the question during his discussions on Perso-Iraqi frontier and their anxiety to secure the Treaty was such* that you yourself * he said, had expressed opinion that it would be unwise for him to leave ^ome without signing it* In the circum stances Nuri Pasha has apparently gone rather far in committing himself to sign the Treaty, though he had gained time by saying that he must have authority from Iraqi government to whom he had referred the matter by telegram. 2. Nuri is at a loss to explain anxiety of Italians except on assumption that they wish to use the Treaty as a lever for obtaining some corresponding advantage from Persia in connexion with the frontier question 0 He fully realises the unfortunate impression which might be created in Geneva and elsewhere were the Treaty to be signed a. tat this stage, it would give the Persian government an opportunity of claiming that, any report favourable to Iraq, on frontier question had been obtained by unfair means; and in fact the Italians might even quote the Treaty when signed, particularly if it aroused criticism, as a reason why they could not present a report very favourable to Iraq, 3* Nuri Pasha has apparently expressed his misgivings to his government but expects to be in a difficult position when he returns to Rome and would appreciate any help that you can give hum 4. Unless you see serious objection please tales an opportunity of pointing out ’unofficially to the Italian government how unwise it would be in the interests of their own reputation to press for the &lt; signature of the Treaty at this moment* There can be no possible objection to the Treaty in itself and you should make it perfectly clear that His Maj Government are in no way opposed to it. it sty ! s is simply a question of the proper time for signature, Nuri Pasha appears quite willing to agree to sign it as soon as present objections have disappeared, and this should give the Italian government reasonable satisfaction* Addressed to Rome No*69, repeated to Bagdad Ho*53 and Tehran No,31*'his D^ument is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] — ■ / v r From :mAQ.. 8 | i 1708 | Dec cypher.

Perso-Iraqi frontier dispute)* I am somewhat reluctant to volunteer advice to Nari Pasha without first knowing his own reaction to Baron Aloisi's suggestions^ since it is clearly desirable that initiative in taking any particular line or in asking for advice from His Majesty 5 s Government should as far as possible remain with Nuri, whom M:r« Edmonds h&amp;d apparently not yet consulted when he spoke to you* Subject to this caveat my provisional views for your information and guidance in any further discussion with Baron Alois!* Nuri or Mr* Edmonds are as follows.;- 2 0 ''I presume that Baron Aloisi’s suggestion regarding the jurists is not that he should at once select them himself* but that he should at next meeting of Council ask for their appointment to advise him and that .if Council approved they would be selected by the President in accordance with the usual procedure 5 which should give parties an opportunity of objecting to particular individuals* I presume also that there would be no question of the jurists giving anything in the nature ©f a final opinion which would replace proposed reference to Permsment Court, and that their opinion would2 , would be merely to assist the rapporteur in drafting a reporto it is important that Iraqis should not lose their right to press for s reference to Permament Court failing a satisfactory settlement* Moreover the documents hitherto considered by Council are hardly complete from Iraqi point of view, and might require to be supplemented before they were considered by the jurists* Are you satisfied that Baron Alois! is right in stating that if advice of jurists were rejected by one party reference to The Hague would necessarily follow?

I assume however that what Baron Alois! has in mind is the difficulty, wh-u,n 1 appreciate, of inducing Persia to withdraw the P^ts which she has established on the Iraqi side of the 1914 frontier., As regards tne Shatt, e,d^tin 0 arrangements are of course based on 1913/14 position, since3. since Port of Basra regulations apply to entire waterway, which is thus treated as wholly Iraqi. If intention is that Persian ships should now agree to slide by those regulations pending final settlement, position would be eminently satisfactory as their present disregard of regulations causes serious danger to navigation* in view, however, of comparatively small number of Persian ships, two largest of which have recently gone to Bombay to refit, point may not be of vital importance, and it seems essential that final settlement should not be delayed by efforts to devise complicated temporary mo dus Vivendi^ 4. The need for any kind of temporary provision must of course depend on the delay to be anticipated in reaching the final solution. On this point hurl Pasha must be the Judge, but in general it seems to me that Nuri would be well advised to continue to press for an early permament settlement both of the juridical and practical issues involved, on lines suggested m paragraph 4 of my telegram No.50 (of January 26th). 5.

THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit copy of a record of a conversation between Mr. Sterndale Bennett and M. Ala, on the 18th January, respecting the Perso-Iraqi frontier. United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, January 18, 1935. Enclosure in No. 1. Record of a Conversation betiveen Mr. Sterndale Bennett and M. Ala respecting the Perso-Iraqi Frontier. I WENT to see M. Ala this morning to inform him of the reaction of His Majesty’s Government to the request which he had made to me that His Majesty’s Government should intervene to induce Iraq to agree to the thalweg frontier in the Shatt-el-Arab. I told him at once that Elis Majesty’s Government did not feel that they could comply with this request. I recalled what I told him at our previous interview, namely, that His Majesty’s Government were anxious to see a just settlement of the dispute, not only because oi their past connexion with the question and their present relations with Iraq, but also in the interests of improving their own friendly relations with Persia; and that His Majesty’s Government had shown their anxiety to reach a settlement by the attempt which they had already ma e o overcome practical difficulties in the Shatt-el-Arab. I reminded him, a so, a T.x expressed the personal view that, particularly when th ® appeared to have taken the law into their own hands, is a 3 e ® ^ which ment might find it difficult to urge upon the Iraqi Government a c °ncession wh would certainly be regarded in Iraq as a surrender un er • . , g language had now been approved, and, m fact, the vie i-m i, ^ see Government was that matters had now gone so far a i w voiiqitv of how there could be any compromise until the juridical issue ■ •, ^ d the instruments on which the present frontier was “ Pending a solution of this question, there appealed 0 U/J , w hich &amp; had been The view of His Majesty’s Government was, therefore that which ^ expressed by Mn Eden at would be difficult intervention on the lines suggested by tne lew] t0 “itlaid thft was naturally disappointed ^ned'inae 6 ' serious practical difficulties so far as Persia Const it u tion the approval reference to the Permanent Court.

He did not see, therefore, now accept reference to the Permanent Court. d howeve r. that the objection I said that I was sorry to hear this, I understooci u ^ ied that he applied to compulsory reference to The Hagu ,1 Council in another matter thought that Mr. Eden had already made it clear to the C' 1 binding, that the opinion of The Hague Court must, f fac C b rega ^ I agreed that, no doubt, the Council, having asked an opi [315 t—-1]Court, would find it difficult to disregard that opinion. But what I had in mm] in speaking of compulsory reference was not the binding nature of the award' what I had meant to indicate was that Persia might not be precluded honj agreeing voluntarily to a reference to the Court on this question. M. Ala said that he thought that even this course could not be taken, at all events without the prior approval of the Majlis. He then went to express regret again that the suggestion of reference to The Hague Court should have been put forward, and he thought that a wrom impression had thereby been created in the newspapers, more particularly iS the Times, whose correspondent he was shortly going to interview to correct the misapprehensions which he had noticed in the reports in the Times on this question. In particular, the Times report of the meeting on the 15th January had been put in such a way as to infer that the suggestion of reference to The Hague Court was the only one which had been pursued. I said that I thoudit that his apprehensions were exaggerated, but it was not for me to discuss the manner in which the Times had reported the Council meeting. After some further desultory discussion, M. Ala suddenly exclaimed, some what aggressively, that the Persian Government could not understand why His Majesty’s Government did not show goodwill in this matter, why they supported the Iraqi Government and why they gave so much weight to their treaty with Iraq. I said that I could not allow this reflection on His Majesty’s Government to pass. I thought that His Majesty’s Government had given every proof of their goodwill; they had done their best to find a satisfactory practical solution; moreover, they had sedulously avoided taking sides in the issue now before the Council and had hoped to be able to maintain that attitude. But, after all, the situation was not that the Persian Government had brought the legal question of the validity of the frontier before the Council ; they had actually taken action to enforce their interpretation of the frontier, and the position was that Iraq had complained against what they regarded as aggression. If the Persian Government, in such circumstances, persisted in the unreasonable line that Iraq must be brought to agree to an alteration in the existing frontier before the Persian Government would recognise that frontier at all, they would be taking action calculated to force His Majesty’s Government to align themselves with the Iraqi Government. I did not propose to enter into the arguments about the validity of the present frontier; a great many new considerations had been advanced wdiich would need careful examination; but the fact was that a boundary existed, properly demarcated on the spot with the assistance of the Persian commissioners, and this boundary had been observed for many years. The main document, of which the Persian Government was questioning the validity, was a document which had been signed, amongst others, by a British representative. It could hardly be expected, therefore, that His Majesty’s Go^ ernment would volunteer the view that an instrument to which they were a party, and which had been put into effect, was invalid. Moreover, M. Ala had I asked why His Ma jesty s Government paid such attention to their treaty with | Iraq. I would only reply that it was a habit of His Majesty’s Government to I respect their obligations scrupulously. His Majesty’s Government had not wished this matter to come to the point when they would have to take sides definitely m the Council. They had hoped, and still hoped, that the legal issues involved might be calmly discussed without reference to political affiliations, n 11 iV V 5V n spirit that their suggestion of reference to the Permanent Court had been made. I still hoped that the Persian Government would find it possible to agree to a course which would not necessitate our taking sides and in which political considerations need not enter into account. u A '• h a baic \ w e surely could not regard the 1913 protocol as having been fairly negotiated It had been imposed on Turkey and Persia against their will but more particularly on Persia, since it had been the result of negotiations A.r A y i Wlt ^° Ut ; the , kn °wledge of Persia.

Ala then said that perhaps what was wanted was more time in which *ti-the Council could exercise its conciliatory influence. The Persian delegation felt that the question was being prematurely rushed in the direction of the ' Permanent Court. s : v I did not think it wise to enter upon further contentious ground by referring ir ^ more f to the difficulty created by the Persian refusal to abide by the 1914 line }II %% provisionally and without prejudice, pending a solution of the legal issue' iflllej I therefore took my leave, saying that I had felt bound to speak frankly about on tie the possible line which His Majesty’s Government might feel compelled to take i up in certain circumstances. His IVlajesty s Government would, however, much 3. Gg. prefer that a fair solution of the whole question might be found without the ot for ip: necessity of their having to take sides. I could only hope that the Persian ioutm? delegation would take a line calculated to promote such a settlement, and would iddeuln: not lightly rule out the course of reference to the Permanent Court if efforts to Id not - promote a solution by agreement again broke down, as seemed probable in the tliis mi’ light P ast experience, owing to the absence of a solid basis for negotiations. wmudiaj Majesty ft* lory praib ieissir- nde.

You v/ill realise that main object of His Majesty's Government during impending discussions in EOme is limited to ensuring insofar as they are in a position to do so that Iragis obtain fair treatment. 2. But His Majesty's Government also have an important direct interest in this Question owing to fact that over SC$ of shipping using the Shatt-el-Arab waterway, future of which is one of main objects d dispute, is British and that freedom for British ships to use waterway in all circumstances is an important British strategic interest in.view of Anglo-Iraqi Alliance and of importance of maintaining free acceso Anglo^Persian oil supplies 0 i *i which Iraqi Delegation sho received following advice* 3.

It is important that Iraqi Delegation at Geneva should have test available legal advice when arguing their case before the Council. 2. Although we intend to sYford the Iraqi Delegation at Geneva all the assistance and support we properly can (see my telegram No. 203 (of November 26th)), our position as a member of the Council renders it undesirable that we should be associated too closely with the presentation of the Iraqi case even if the Soviet and Turkish Delegations openly espouse the Persian cause (see for instance language to Persian Minister recorded in my telegram No. J.36 (of December loth) to Tehran). In any case the legal advisers of the United Kingdom Delegation can hardly draft Nuri's speeches for him word for word, even though they might be willing no discuss them privately. But arguments on validity of frontier demarcation need the most careful drafting. 3. We suggest therefore for consideration of Iraqi Government that in our common interest they should reocui services of first-class independent internataonal iav-jt.r accustomed to League procedure.

My telegram No. 56 (of January 21st - Perso-Iraqi frontier), The Rapporteur having been unable to evolve any resolution to which both parties would agree, he informed Council at session on January 21st that he would have to discuss question further with the parties before presenting a comprehensive report. He proposed to devote himself to this task between present and next sessions. If there were for any reason a special session and question was ripe, he hoped it might be placed on the agenda of that session. Iraqi representative then made statement expressing regret that more progress had not been possible in dealing with settlement of dispute. He observed that boundary delimited with participation of Persia had been observed for nearly 20 years and was moreover recognised by the League itself on admission of Iraq to membership. He did not question the right of Persia, to attempt to prove boundary invalid, but international relations v/ould become impossible if a State, on ground that it disputed the validity of the frontier, tried to alter the boundary by unilateral acts before the dispute had been settled. Iraqi G-overnment would do their best to prevent unfortunate incidents, and invited Persian G-overnment to do the same, vdth object of facilitating Parly settlement he declared that Iraqi Government2 . 0rOV3r-.nent were ire erred to a . ee that the mipd-H rmo i- + ^ ia0 bIie questions m diseute should be referred to eiv^a^ent Court for advisory opinion. Lis concluded that having found by this means a firm point of departure for ne 0 o clarions, liaci bovernuient were ready end anxious r 0 discuss with rersia in a spirit of cordial co-operation any diflicultios to v/hich alignment might have given rise. rersian representative observed that Iraqi Government wished to impose on ‘.'ersien Government the regime for which the former honed to obtain recognition. For Versia to accede to thio would be to prejudice her case, he undertook, however, vithouc prejudice and subjecr to reciprocity to do nothing likely to coiuolicace solution. Undor .article 11 it ras not necessary to submit a disoute to other procedure than consideration by the Council, and he referred to the reservations under which ’ersian Government had accepted the motional Clause. He considered it premature to consider question of asking the remanent Court for an advisory opinion and recent discussion in the Council on the Question ot such ooinions would lead the Council to appreciate the rersian Government 1 s hesitation to agree to such a course. i disclaimed intention to enter into the merits of the disoute regarding the legal validity of the documents on which % tne present frontier is based. The arguments presented to the council were complies ted and. it was right that time be given to Hie rapporteur to examine them in collaboration with the parties before making recommendations to the Council 0 Ail I wished to Say at ere sent was that the friendly feelings of His Hajesty f s -over menu tow/ards both parties led them to desire a just settl Gent oi the whole dispute with the least possible delay. Time ' f 'S mow ever imoortant. The question before the Council was a legal ° Iie re lating to the validity of certain documents but it took th form140 3. form of an aooeal by ono country which claimed that its neighbour was ignoring an established frontier and taking unilateral action to enforce her own view of the international instruments on which that frontier was based. The situation was thus a delicate one* and I felt that I should be interpreting the feelings of my colleagues in aosealing ro both sides while discussions were proceeding to avoid any action which might hinder the task of the Council and render more difficult the final settlement of the question at issueo The rapporteur promised to work as quickly as possible taking into consideration the views of the parties and the observations of the United ingdom representative. The Chilean representative then expressed the view that as a matter of procedure the Council should in the case of every appeal under Article 11 paragraph 2, decide whether that provision was applicable* The Turkish representative said that Turkey had views on the validity of the instruments concerned, but that he did not at present y/ish to enter into the merits of the case. He agreed with the rapporteur’s request for time, as no question was more delicate than those concerning frontiers. He agreed, however, that the work should be done as expeditiously as possible, and referred to Turkey’s oosivion as the immediate neighbour of both parties and in treaty relations with them. As regards the Chilean suggestion the Turkish representative, as President of the Council, observed that no objections had been raised in the present case and both parties were in agreement to proceed under iaticle 11. The Chilean representative pressed his proposal that the wouncil should take a formal decision that the conciliation procedure wns applicable to each case brought under Article 11c in t-ie absence of any objection the President of the Council declared this proposal adopted.j _ A . — [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use 1 ‘ — — *—-■ H &gt; v &gt; \.J Decyplier 0 From MTSZMMWj* His Majesty 1 s Consul (Geneva) B a 2 0 00 p 0 m 0 21st January : 1935 0 NOo37« L«No (BY TELEPHONE) * xxzxxxxxxxx My inTnediately preceding telegram.

THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit the text of a speech by Nuri Pasha at Council meeting on the 14th January, respecting the Perso-Iraqi 'frontier. United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, January 14, 1935. Enclosure in No. 1. Perso-Iraqi Frontier: Speech by Nuri Pasha before the Council of the League, January 14, 1935. THE nature of the present case is indicated in the communication dated the 29th November, 1934, in which my Government requested the Secretary-General to bring the matter before the Council of the League of Nations. The Persian Government have filed a reply transmitted to the Secretary- General on the 8th January last, with which I shall have to deal in a moment; but before coming to the question in issue, there is one point of minor importance which I should like to get out of the way. Appendix III to our request was compiled with studied moderation; it only included copies of correspondence regarding violations of the boundary by official agents of the Persian Government, which had led up to specific denials of the validity of the existing frontier. I much regret that the Persian Government should have thought necessary to introduce, by Appendix I of their reply, the entirely irrelevant matter of tribal disorders. I do not propose to waste the time of the Council by following them on this ground. I would only say that the true state of affairs is very different from that which the correspondence quoted seems intended to suggest. In order to understand the subject-matter of this case, it is necessary to have in mind the general geographical position, and I would ask the members of the Council to be good enough to glance at the map which has been supplied for their use. The boundary which is the object of the dispute that has unfortuna e y arisen between the Governments of Iraq and Persia is the whole of the boun ary between the two countries, extending from the Persian Gulf to Mount Dalampar, where the frontier line meets the Turkish boundary, a distance o some 1,200 kilom. Throughout the length of the frontier between Iraq an ersia, except for a few small townships, the inhabitants are for the most par primi ive and nomadic. Until recent years there was little Government contro , m so sectors it was, indeed, completely absent. Communications Y ere i s 0W (. difficult, owing alike to the physical nature of the country, and the ciiara . ( / e ^. the frontier population. These facts must be borne in mind when consn e ^ the long delays and the great difficulties encountered in the past m e ec &amp; delimitation of the frontier on the spot. AA , ^ o i arcr p In the southern sector the boundary follows for about ^ /d 0 ' i Ui navigable river, the Shatt-el-Arab, and here there is considerab e On the general question of equity, the Iraqi Government feels that it is Uaq and not Persia that has grounds for complaint. Persia has ^ coas „ kilom 2,000 kilom. with many ports and anchorages. In the Khor Musa, yaway to the east of the Shatt-el-Arab, Persia possesses a deep-water harbour penetrating far into Persian territory, where sne has already constructed the terminus of the Trans-Persian Railway. Iraq is essentially the land of the two rivers. Euphrates and Tigris. The Shatt-el-Arab, formed by their junction, constitutes Iraq’s only access to the sea; it requires constant attention if it is to be kept fit for navigation by modern shipping, and Basra, 100 kilom. from the I mouth, is Iraq’s only port. It is highly undesirable, from Iraq’s point of view, that another Power should command this channel from one bank. Iraq is not I asking that the frontier should be altered, but I make these remarks to show that it is not because the existing line is unduly to its advantage. The difficulties that have arisen with the Persian Government are described in Appendix III of my Government’s request to the Council. As there indicated, they fall under four heads. In the first place, Persian officials have been interfering with, and Persian war vessels impeding, navigation on the Shatt-el- Arab. The maritime sector of the river is under the control of the Directorate of the Port of Basra, which makes and enforces navigation regulations and carries out the dredging operations which are necessary to keep the channel open. The Persian war vessels deliberately disregard these regulations, thereby endangering shipping on the river. Persian customs officials have extended their activities to places outside Persian territory; Persian armed ratings have been sent up and down the river on patrol duty. A second category of incidents is in connexion with police posts. The Persian Government have been establishing police posts and patrols at various points on the Iraq side of the boundary, and, except in two cases, the endeavours of my Government to have them removed have been unavailing. A third head of dispute relates to the ownership of a small strip of territory called Sarkoshk; and the fourth arises out of the damming by the Persian authorities, of the Gun]am Cham River, the median line of which constitutes part of the boundary. This is merely a cursory summary of the kind of difficulty which has been going on over a period of years. My Government have made every effort to bring these incidents to an end by friendly representations, but every step in this direction has been met by the Persian Government with a denial that the areas where the acts complained of were committed are under Iraqi sovereignty. The Persian Government decline to recognise the existing boundary as laid down by the Treaties and Demarcation Commissions without, on their part, explaining where they suggest the boundary to be. It is obvious that a situation of this kind cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely, and it is in these circumstances that my Government have felt bound to invoke Ihe assistance of the Council. As appears from the request, the Government of Iraq take their stand upon international agreements concluded in the past, under which the frontier now m question was determined and fixed. The first of these is the Treaty of Erzerum between Persia and Turkey signed on the 31st May, 1847, and ratified by those Powers on the 21st March, 1848. In the understanding of my Government, articles 2 and 3 of this treaty (see request, Appendix I) laid down the whole of the frontier between Turkey and Persia, including that part which now forms the boundary between Persia and Iraq. This view is by no means new, but was the one repeatedly expressed in the course of past diplomatic negotiations. Moreover, in the submission of my Government, the third paragraph of article 2 of the same treaty itself provides,^implicitly at any rate, for the left bank of the Shatt-el- Arab, and not the thalweg, being the frontier of Persia in the southern sector, say this now because the Persian Government, in their reply (II, p- I) COI1 ^ e / 1 . that it was in the Protocol of Constantinople of 1913 that for the first time tins arrangement was forced upon Persia. That this is not the case is shown not only by the terms of article 2 of the Treaty of Erzerum, but also by the fact that e very first Delimitation Commission set up under the treaty, which went out m 1850, proposed the same boundary line, and this was accepted by the Persian Prime Minister on the 25th Mav of that year. As a matter of history it isoniyi the decade immediately preceding the Treaty of Erzerum that a wave of Persia expansion and the internecine strife of the independent Arab Amirate o Chab, of which the Ottoman Government claimed suzerainty, brought a sm Persian garrison to Muhammara, the minor Arab port on the Karun river near confluence with the Shatt-el-Arab. The Persian possession of the left banK really in the nature of an anomaly which was first validated by the Trea yErzerum, which the Persian Government now affect to consider void It has neve,- before now been seriously suggested that Persia had any claim to sovereignty over any part of the river itself, except the Muhammara anchorage ' The Persian Government in their reply sent to the Secretary-General on the 8th January, 1935, raise a great number of legal points, some of which are now brought forward for the first time, m order to dispute the validity of the various international agreements relating to the frontier. First of all the Persian Government say that the Treaty of Erzernm, although, as I have already stated, it was signed and latified by Persia as well as Turkey, was null and void ab initio (Reply I). Ihe aigument on this point is somewhat complicated and I hope the Council will f 01 give me if I only deal with it briefly at the present stage. In substance it comes to this : before the treaty was signed, the Ottoman Government asked the mediating Poweis, Great Britain and Russia, for certain explanations of the text of the treaty. Ihe mediating Powers answered in an explanatory note dated the 26th April, 1847. The Ottoman Government expressed itself as satisfied, on the understanding that the Persian Government also accepted the explanatory note, and the Persian envoy did accept, m writing. The documents are set out in Appendix I of the request. The Persian Government say that the Persian envoy exceeded his instructions by accepting the explanatory note, and was not authorised to do anything more than ratify the treaty itself. The plea that a Government is not bound by the act of its duly accredited representatives is always an unfortunate one, as well as a very weak one in law. Whether or not the Persian envoy, in fact, exceeded his powers depends upon a number of considera tions, including his instructions, which have not been produced, and the question whether the explanatory note goes beyond the terms of the treaty itself. But even supposing, for the sake of argument, that the Persian envoy did, in fact, exceed his powers (which I do not, of course, admit) I fail to see how, on any view, it would lie with the Persian Government to dispute the validity of the treaty. Although I do not think the argument would be sound, it might be possible to argue that the Ottoman Government could have disputed the validity of the treaty if the Persian Government had refused to be bound by their representative’s acceptance of the explanatory note, but there can surely be no justification for the suggestion that the Persian Government have the right to repudiate the treaty because they did not regard themselves as bound by what they considered to be an incorrect or onerous interpretation of its terms. But the matter does not rest there. The Treaty of Erzerum has been acted upon by Turkey and Persia, as well as the mediating Powers, from 1848 right down to at least 1914, and it has been repeatedly invoked and relied upon by Persia itself in the course of the diplomatic proceedings in connexion with the frontier. As regards the explanatory note itself, there is nothing material to the present case in its contents, but if anything did turn on it, it is to be observed that the Persian Government in 1912 expressly declared that it accepted it (Reply II, p. 4). My Government submit that there can be no question as to the validity of the Treaty of Erzerum. The Persian Government suggest that little or nothing was done to give effect to the treaty, but this is not in accordance with the facts. The Delimitation Commission, provided for by aricle 3, went out to Bagdad in 1849, and travelled up and down the boundary from then until 1852. They made a survey which was completed in September 1852. The Crimean war then intervened, but in 1857 the British and Russian surveyors met to compile maps from the material collected. Ultimately a revised map, called the C£ Carte identique,” was completed and communicated to the Turkish and Persian Governments. Between 1869 and 1873 Persia made frequent appeals for the intervention of the mediating Powers in the question of the boundary. In 1874 a Turco-Persian Commission met in Constan tinople, but this reached a deadlock because Persia claimed to proceed according to the Treaty of Erzerum, whereas Turkey at that time desired to go back to a treaty of 1639. Next year a British and Russian commissioner were added to the commission, but the Russo-Turkish war again interrupted progress. Between then and 1911 there were frequent appeals by Persia to the mediating Powers based upon alleged violations by Turkey of the Treaty of Erzerum. Then, on the 21st December, 1911, the Protocol of Tehran was signed by Persia and Turkey. This is the document which, the Persian Government [315 q—1] B 2complain, was not mentioned in the Iraqi request (Reply II, p. 3), a pp e to me that this protocol strongly supports my Government’s case. It provirJ for the appointment of a commission composed of the delegates of the tw S Governments to meet in Constantinople, charged with the task of establishin 0 the frontier. How was this to be done ? By article 3 of the protocol the work of the commission shall have as its basis the clauses of the Treaty of Erzernn) concluded in 1263 (1847). The Persian Government say that “ unlike tir’ non-existent treaty of 1847, the Protocol of Tehran constitutes in form a regular engagement ” (Reply II, p. 3). I am glad that there is at least one international instrument of which the Persian Government recognise the validity, but I find it difficult to follow the rest of the argument in the reply (II, pp. 3-4). ]y seen]s to me that the Protocol of Tehran expressly recognises the Treaty of Erzerum and in mentioning the year 1847 merely follows the common practice of referrip to treaties by the date of their signature. The commission provided for by the Protocol of Tehran met in 1912, but did not progress satisfactorily, and the next year the Protocol of Constantinople was concluded between Great Britain Pmis and turkey. This document, which is set out in Appendix Ha of the request, defines the boundary in some detail, mainly by reference to geographical features, and provides for a Delimitation Commission consisting of representatives of each of the signatory Powers with power to the mediating commissioners to decide finally on disputed questions. the Persian Government, here again, deny the validity of this international agreement, as well as of everything done under it. It is to be observed, in the first place, that the Protocol of Constantinople is, on the face of it, just as much a regular engagement” as the Protocol of Tehran. Just as the signatories were perfectly entitled to make the Tehran Agreement, so they were perfectly entitled, when that agreement proved to be unworkable, to enter into a fresh agreement. There is no foundation, in my Government’s view, for any of the arguments advanced by the Persian Government against the binding character of the Constantinople Protocol. It is said that the protocol goes beyond the Treaty of rzerum as regards the frontier line. As a matter of fact, the protocol is based upon the treaty, to which it refers, and the line described follows closely what, as a result or the investigations already made, was thought to be the Erzerum line, e submission for my Government is that the frontier defined in the Protocol of ons antmople, and as delimited on the spot by the commission set up under the pro oco is based upon the treaty, and, substantially speaking, merely gives P^ a . c / ca e ^ ec ^ f 0 terms. But obviously this is a very complicated question which cannot be examined here and now by the Council. e question whether the line fixed under the Constantinople Protocol conespon s with the line laid down by the Treaty of Erzerum is only relevant ^T 1011 Wltil Persian arguments, namely, the contention that the v 0( ? w aS 1 ? lva ^ 1 ^ because the Persian Constitution requires parliamentary rv£j? Va 8r . c ^ an &amp; es m tbe boundaries of the State. The first answer of my ls . the protocol did not change the boundaries as laid down by j-j i _f n existing trepty, namely, the Treaty of Erzerum. But if the protocol WpmhtSLrn 6 ° UI l &lt; ? aries ’ I would point out, in the first place, that the Persian qo tw tiL -p 6 ^ a jl ls wa . s to abeyance from December 1911 to December 1914, onv vnliH o ersian contention amounts to saying that Persia could not enter into he co pt greement affecting its frontiers during this period, which can hardly to comnlv wui? ar p ? 11 ^ 1S Ptont, however, I submit with confidence that failure tion dooQ nni qN ational provisions as to parliamentary approval or ratifica- renularlv cooclnH 0 ^ va tohty, under international law, of a treaty or protocol case orovidch f ded doeS not in terms refer to th ese matters, or, as in this case, provided for ratification at all.

The commission completed the whole of its work, except for one small sector north of Mount Dalampar and therefore outside the area with which we are concerned. I desire to emphasise that the task of the commission was an extremely difficult and arduous one, performed with the greatest care and ability, and that as a result of its labours the whole of the boundary between Persia and Iraq was marked out by frontier posts and precise indications on large-scale maps. It is this clear and well-considered boundary which my Government wish to see respected as the frontier between the two countries. The Iraqi Government does not adopt this attitude because they consider the •existing frontier to be favourable to their country. On the contrary, as I stated at the beginning of my remarks, there are several respects in which the boundary is far from satisfactory. But my Government adhere to it because it is the frontier laid down by law and it is the only frontier between the two countries that is certain and fixed in fact. If this boundary were repudiated, it is hardly possible to exaggerate the difficulties that would be encountered in agreeing upon a new line. The Persian Government, at the end of their reply, reproach my Government with not being abreast with the times in this matter. But even the most up-to-date States must have frontiers, and I fail to see what these frontiers can be except the ones laid down in the past, unless and until they are altered by some method recognised by international law. Before concluding, I should like to add a very few words about the position on the Shatt-el-Arab. I have already explained that the fixing of the boundary at the left bank is an old standing arrangement, and how it came about. The Persian Government raise a number of objections to this arrangement, appealing to international practice and conventions as showing that it is anomalous, if not, indeed, contrary to law. I quite agree that it is usual where a navigable river forms an international boundary for the thalweg to constitute the dividing line, but this is by no means a universal rule. The boundary can, and sometimes is, fixed at the bank by agreement, and when this is the case the agreement is incontestably valid. What I desire should be quite clear, is that in the present case there are special reasons which amply justify the present boundary line, and further that there never has been any question that the Iraqi Government contemplate using their position on the river to interfere with or restrict free navigation by any other country. The maritime portion of the river is under the control of a well-organised and efficient body, the Directorate of the Port of Basra, whose aim is to keep the river free both of physical obstacles and all other impediments to navigation. I am conscious that I have not dealt with all the arguments in the Persian reply, although I have endeavoured to refer briefly to what seem to be the main ones. I do not want to weary the Council by prolonging this already lengthy statement, but I hope it will be understood that silence on any point does not imply any admission on the part of my Government. We are prepared to deal with, and I hope refute, all the points raised whenever it may be necessary to go into them. Most of the points raised by the Persian Government, however, those with which I have dealt as well as those I have passed over, aie of a legal character which hardly renders them suitable for decision by the Council itse . Some of these points are complex and, although the answer appears to my Government to be clear, the issues raised seem to call for detailed examination by a judicial body. There is a passage in the letter of the Persian Minister tor Foreign Affairs to the Iraqi Charge d’Affaires, dated the 17th December, , in answer to the submission of this case to the League with which my Government is in hearty agreement. The Persian Minister writes that it is beyond question that the sincerity and loyal co-operation between our two Governments and nations cannot be inaugurated until the frontier line be ween 01 I r ^ countries, which is one of the essential questions, is fixed on a asis o g ( £ droit ’), justice and the principles of international law. It is the aim and purpose of my Government which entertains A 6 friendly feelings for Persia, in bringing this case before e i ii u :a definition of the legal position. After that has been de ^ n ^ s ^ ould th possible for the two Governments to settle by negotiation such questions as ihe control of navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab, the reasonable use of the waters ot other rivers further north constituting or crossing the ro , y outstanding difficulties.6 It goes without saying that, pending the definition of the legal position under the auspices of the Council, the frontier as now delimited should be respected and my Government would be glad to have the assistance of the Council in obtaining from the Persian Government an assurance to this efiect, and in particular that the Persian warships, whose present rash navigation ~ f^ in+ovnnfinnfll shinninp' and other interests: and m particular mai luc cioxcm VT ^ ~ luou. udviganon constitutes a danger to international shipping and othei interests, will abide ,1 by the rules of the port of Basra. falSj . pUnitf Is reference djiitktth Itwaryesi bee in fa\ lour rights: li desire t( k however, ird to the 1 ®ssion to v H InTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT r A P. z. !

THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compli ments, and has the honour to transmit record of a conversation between Mr. Sterndale Bennett and M. Ala, the Persian representative, respecting the Perso- Iraqi frontier. Geneva, January 16, 1935. Enclosure in No 1. Perso-Iraqi Frontier : Conversation with M. Ala. M. ALA asked me to go to see him this morning. He told me that he had taken up with M. Kazemi the point which I had raised yesterday regarding what M. Kazemi had in mind, when speaking to Sir John Simon on the 11th January, in his reference to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930. M. Kazemi had asked him to explain that the Persians had been through the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty with some care and had noticed that article 7 of the annex to the treaty gave certain rights to British war vessels. They had felt that we might possibly be reluctant to use our influence in favour of a division of sovereignty over the Shatt-el-Arab for fear that our rights in that river might be curtailed. M. Ala said that M. Kazemi had not had in mind general shipping rights, though we might rest assured that Persia had no desire to put obstacles in the way of our shipping. M. Kazemi’s remarks were, however, intended to refer solely to war vessels. M. Ala remarked that, in regard to the Persian Gulf, British war vessels fell into two categories. There were those which were permanently stationed in the Gulf, and these had general permission to visit Persian Gulf ports, subject only to notification to the local authority. In the case of war vessels not permanently stationed in the Persian Gulf, however, notification had to be made to the Central Government at Tehran and specific authorisation given in each case. What M. Kazemi had intended to convey to Sir John Simon was that, if Persia obtained equal sovereignty in the Shatt-el-Arab, the Persian Government would be prepared to give to British wai vessels in the Persian half of the Shatt the same facilities as were conceded by article 7 of the annex to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. British war vessels stationed in the Persian Gulf would only have to notify the local authorities, while the visits of other vessels would be notified to Tehran for authorisation. I promised to report this fuller explanation to the Secretary of State. M. Ala then went on to speak of the frontier dispute in general and said t a he did not wish to criticise what Mr. Eden had said at the Council meeting, as e knew that Mr. Eden entertained very friendly feelings towards Persia and a the suggestion which he had put forward was designed to further a friendly settlement. At the same time, he wondered whether the proposal f 01 L a r^rence to the Permanent Court might not have been somewhat premature. Un said mat a wrong impression appeared already to have been created. e emps, or instance, had reported that the Council had actually decided yes er W 0 the matter to the Court. I remarked that this was clearly a misunders an mg which could easily be cleared up. The suggestion of reference to The Hague Court had, of course, been put forward as one for the rapporteur to consi e . M. Ala went on to express the view that a, reference to T e f a decision by that body might leave bitter feelings oehind it. ( e m ep . he was not, of course, suggesting that the Persian Government thought then m weak.) He recalled tha,t in the dispute about the Anglo-Persian Oil Compa ^ reference to a legal tribunal had been avoided by friend y agree \ ^ had a good effect on the relations between Persia and Great Britain. Had [315 r 11 /m dispute been carried to a legal tribunal, the result might have been far otherwise Did I not think, therefore, that it would be better for the Council to aim at promoting a friendly compromise ? I said that the suggestion of reference to the Permanent Court had been put forward because there appeared to be at present no basis for a compromise. Each side appeared to be anxious for a friendly settlement of the difficulties which had arisen on the frontier, and efforts had been made for some time past to reach such a settlement. But they had all broken down on the legal point of the validity of the existing line. I pointed out that a decision by The Hague Court would not of course, finally settle the whole question. It might, however, pave the way for a subsequent settlement of any difficulties to which the existing line had given rise M. Ala asked whether, in our view, it should be the Council who should refer to The Hague Court and not the two parties. I said that we had not got any scheme worked out in detail, but that one course might be for the Council to ask The Hague Court for an advisory opinion as a preliminary to promoting any direct settlement between the parties. I said that the position was that°tliere appeared to be a deadlock between the two parties on the legal issue. Obviously it was difficult for either side to give way on that issue, and our suggestion had been made in the hope of facilitating a solution by clearing that issue out of the way without involving a surrender which both parties might find it difficult to make. M. Ala said he appreciated this. He still thought, however, that the Council should make an attempt to get a compromise without reference to the legal issue, and M. Kazemi wished him to ask that His Majesty’s Government should use their good offices, and more than that, their support, in inducing the Iraqi Govern ment to depart from their present intransigent attitude regarding the line in the Shatt-el-Arab. What the Persian Government wanted was that Iraq should agree to a division of sovereignty in the Shatt. I said that this was a request which I should have to refer to higher authority. His Majesty s Government, of course, desired a just settlement of this dispute, ihey would like to see it out of the way in the interests of their own friendly relations with Persia as well as in view of their special relations with Iraq. They had, m fact, already done their best in the past to bring about a practical settle- ment. I referred to the proposed Conservancy Convention. Persia had not followed up this attempt and it had broken down, according to the Persian state ment before theJLeague, because it did not give Persia a share of the sovereignty m the bhatt. bpeaking personally, it seemed to me that it might be difficult • 01 f^ a J est y s Government to urge the Iraqi Government to make a concession in the bhatt. M. Ala must bear in mind the special bond which existed between i aq and ourselves. In any case, might not Nuri Pasha be in an extremely difficult posi ion with ^Nationalist opinion in Iraq if he agreed to what would certainly be represented as a surrender to the Persians ? M. Ala asked whether he was to um ei s and from this that we would not be prepared to use our influence in favour o the solution which he had suggested. I replied that I was not at present in a Jr • } 0l j ? answe r to his request one way or the other. It was a matter S 0L k- i^r Ve re ^ er higher authority. I was merelv indicating the difficulties which I personally foresaw. ,A„ Ala Commenced a diatribe against Nuri Pasha, whom he represented y yyransrgent. Other Iraqi statesmen had shown an inclination to tho/ihic b ’ U A lU * P as ha would not yield an inch on this question.

It was on account of this action (which M. Ala did not attempt to deny) that the question had been brought before the Council, and it seemed to me personally rather difficult for the Iraqi Government to agree to an alteration of part of the frontier at a time when, in their view Persia was actually violating the frontier. For these reasons it still seemed to me that a decision on the legal question might be found to be necessary before anv effective progress could be made. I made it clear again, however that I was merely indicating the difficulties which I foresaw, and that the request which he had made for our good offices would obviously have to be carefully considered The interview was extremely cordial throughout. »k Geneva, January 16, 1935.

Activities of Tevfik Rii§tu. Mr. EDMONDS came in this evening to talk generally on procedure in connexion with the above question, and after a discussion regarding the choice of a rapporteur, he said that Nuri Pasha wished me to know that he had seen the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon. Tevfik ftu§tu had enquired why Iraq persisted in referring the question of the validity of the existing frontier to the Council. Why should Iraq not agree to a redefinition of the frontier in an entirely new instrument with Persia which would not mention the 1913 protocol, or the 1914 demarcation or the Treaty of Erzerum, thus following the course which Turkey and Persia had followed as regards their own common frontier? Nuri Pasha had adopted a cautious attitude and had asked whether Tevfik Rii^tii meant that the 1914 frontier should, in fact, be laid down absolutely unchanged in a new instrument. Tevfik Ru§tii had indicated that this was his meaning, though he admitted that the Perso-Turkish Agreement had departed in one or two particulars from the 1914 frontier. Nuri had then asked how Tevfik Ru§tii , s suggestion would be applied in the case of the Shatt-el- Arab. Surely it would not be possible to get the Persians to agree to the frontier running as it did now, i.e., along the low-water line on the left (Persian) bank ? Tevfik Ru§tu said that he thought the Persians might be prepared to accept even this, simply retaining for themselves a “ droit de profit.’ In reply to an enquiry by Nuri, Tevfik R/ii§tu said that by this term he meant the right of using the water of the Shatt for drinking and irrigation and the right of navigation. Nuri Pasha continued to show scepticism as to whether the idea of redefining the frontier unchanged would prove practicable and indicated that it would neer an actual draft agreement to convince him. He said at the same D// 16 Ty 0 course, if the Persians were to produce a draft, he naturally would no e so churlish as to refuse to consider it. . , , Tevfik Ru§tu indicated that he intended to take the mattei up wi Porsiciiis Mr. Edmonds thought that this was a sign that the Persians were, in fact, weakening, but he agreed with me that it would be a tactical mis a e Iraqis to agree to the matter being withdrawn from consideration by the Eoimcd unless and until a satisfactory instrument had been drawn up an ^ signed. We agreed that it would be well to let matters take ^eir course, as^even if the Council decided to seek an advisory opinion from &amp; ’ i • n 0 f‘a to The Hague could presumably be cancelled at any time i new agreement rendered it unnecessary. j c sterndale _bENNETT.

Mr. EDMONDS told me to-day that Tevfik Ru§tii had visited the Iraqi delegation after this morning’s meeting of the Council, and had represented himself as very impressed with the case which Nuri Pasha had put forward. He said that he had suggested to the Persian delegation the advantage of redefining the present frontier unchanged in a new instrument which would not refer to the Treaty of Erzerum or the 1913 protocol. The Persian Minister for Foreign AJfairs, however, felt that the Shah would never agree to this, and, in fact, Kazemi dared not put it forward. Tevfik Rii§tu was toying with the idea of getting the Gazi personally to recommend to the Shah the course which he, Tevfik Rii§tu, had suggested. 2. Tevfik Rii§tu gave the impression that he now did not think the Persian case to be very strong. The French Legal Adviser to the Persian, delegation, M. de Lapradelle, however, professed to consider that the Persians had a 100 per cent, case, and it seemed likely that he would be inclined to advise reference to The Hague. Tevfik Rfiijtu now seemed to think that, unless his scheme for a redefinition of the frontier proved practicable, reference to e Hague might be the soundest course for the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to adopt in order to safeguard his own personal position.

KAZEMI, the Persian Foreign Minister, saw me this afternoon about the Iraq-Persian dispute which is coming before the Council under article 11. Mr. Eden was also present. M. Kazemi asked for our sympathetic support, and hinted that we had promised it at the time when we were urging Persia to agree to recognise the independence of Iraq. I corrected (not for the first time) this version by saying that we were certainly anxious to see that in this dispute Peisia secured full iustice. He sketched the case which he was going to present on behai of Persia before the Council, arguing that the treaty of 1847 and the pro oco of 1913 did not decide the matter in Iraq’s favour, and that the second documen in particular had no binding force because it had never been latn e y Mailis. I asked him whether the protocol contained a c )^ use subsequent ratification, and I understood him to say that it did not but mat the Persian Constitution required it.

United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, January 12, 1935. Enclosure in No. 1. Record of a Conversation with Nouri Pasha. NOURJ PASHA called on me this afternoon with the Iraqi Prime Minister and Muzahim-al-Pachachi, the Iraqi permanent delegate in Geneva. The Lord Privy Seal was present and took part in the interview. They wished to talk about the Perso-Iraq dispute now before the Council under article 11 concerning the boundary between those two countries, especially about the Shatt-el-Arab. They did not in terms press for our support in deciding the dispute, but obviously wished to gather our views as far as we would give them. I said that I was glad to see that they had secured the professional advice of Mr. Fachiri; they could not have made a better choice. We referred to the two main documents in the case—the treaty of 1847, between the Ottoman Empire and Persia, and the protocol of 1913. Persia desires to contend, on various grounds, that neither of these documents have a binding force in determining the boundary. I observed that, on this contention, Persia’s difficulty would seem to be that, if these instruments did not assist to define the boundary, then there was no defined boundary at all. As regards the protocol of 1913, I enquired whether it was the fact that Persia had acted under this protocol for the purpose of securing certain delimitations which had been effected, because, if so, it would be rather difficult to see how Persia could repudiate a document under which ^ she had taken advantage. But I was careful throughout neither to indicate a formed view nor to offer any assurance as to the conclusion which we should favour. I said that we should endeavour to do our duty as a member of the Council entrusted with the decision of the matter, and I was sure that this was all that Iraq expected oi us. With this my visitors appeared quite content. In the course of the interview Nouri Pasha discussed the probable course oi procedure, explaining that he himself would present the case, and that the Persian Foreign Minister would then, he supposed, reply. Would it be necessary to appoint a ra'p'porteur, and what were our views as to the best rajjyoi to choose? I replied that I thought that the Council would certainly find i necessary to nominate a rafforteur to study the documents and inteiview e parties, and, failing an agreed accommodation, to make a report to the Counci , and I reminded them that this was the course which had been taken wnen we brought before the Council our dispute with Persia over the withdrawal ot me concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. As for the choice ot tafporeur, the best selection would be a member of the Council whose country a no particular association with the parties or the dispute. The United Kingdom would not be suitable because of our treaty with Iraq. I presumed that neithe Turkey nor Russia would be thought the best choice in the circumstances. - ou [315 o—2]2 Pasha indicated that Sr. Madariaga had been suggested, and Mr. Eden mention ,1 Dr. Munch, the representative of Denmark. We agreed that either of would be very suitable nominations. Nouri Pasha said that he had heard7 suggestion of Dr. Benes, but he did not appear greatly to favour this name 6 Nouri Pasha said that in dealing with proposals to reach a eompromu without coming to the Council, Iraq had insisted that the treaties must be basis. He mentioned, as a reason for Persia’s desire to secure a shifting of / boundary in her favour, the Persian plan for building a railway which would have its terminus within this area. J. S.

IN continuation of my telegram No. 288 of the 27th December, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith an interesting record of a conversation between Dr. Naji Beg Asil (Director-General of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs) and my first secretary on the subject of the appeal made to the Council of the League by the Iraqi Government regarding the present state of relations with Persia. 2.

I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Ministers at Tehran and Angora. I have, &amp;c. f’. h.‘ humphrys. Enclosure in No. 1. Minute by Mr. Bateman respecting a Conversation with Dr. Naji Beg .Asil. Dr. NAJI ASIL came and dined privately last night with me. He had previously asked when he might call and give me his best wishes and hinted that he had some news for me. 2. The gist of his remarks was as follows :— 3. Some weeks ago, during one of his frequent visits to the Ministry, the Persian Minister asked Dr. Naji whether he would object to his speaking quite frankly about the frontier question. On Dr. Naji’s intimating that he would welcome it, Khan Samii then gave him to understand that Persia’s claim to half the Shatt was only part of the Shah’s plan to have the British out of the Gulf once and for all. Samii alluded to the Persian claims to Bahrein and the other islands and to their activities regard Koweit, and said that this, together with their determination to get control of the buoying and lighting in the Gulf, was only an indication of what the Shah meant to do and how far he was prepared to go. But, said Samii, so long as Basra remains what it is and the British interests in the Shatt remained as they are, all the efforts of the Persians to oust the British will be vain. It was therefore essential to the Persian case that the British should be eliminated from any practical agreement between Iraq and Persia. Otherwise all the Shah’s greater plans for the Persianisation of the Gull would be like crying for the moon. 4. The natural inference which he wished Dr. Naji to draw from ad this was that, if Iraq would accommodate the Persians by giving them hall the Shat , the Persians would willingly agree to a practical ‘ ‘ navigation arrangemen provided the British had no part in it. . . j + 5. Dr. Naji drew him on this point and the Persian Minister agreed t a he had understood him aright. 6. He then asked for Dr. Naji’s personal views. 7. Dr. Naji, in reply, pointed out that the Persian r / ever be put into practice so long as Iraq adhered to the treaty of 1930 and a frankness was the basis of the discussion, he must tell him quite °P er j J a Iraq had no intention of throwing that treaty overboard. It was ^ 8eiess 101 Persia to proceed on the line that they could drive a coach and horses througn i ^ Besides this, he felt bound to tell him that Persian behaviour m the bhatt up date was no great encouragement to the Iraqis to come to an} agieemen withe Persians which would in any way conflict with, or cause any derogation from, Iraq’s legal rights. He also pointed out that Basra was Iraq’s only port and that its only protection lay in Iraqi sovereignty over the Shatt. 8. The Persian Minister then proposed internationalisation of the water way, but was told in reply that the history of international waterways in Europe was no encouraging precedent for Iraq to follow. 9. Khan Samii then hinted that, if Iraq would not come to heel, the Shah might decide to make a naval base at Mohammerah. To this, Dr. Naji replied that the only result of this would be the creation of an Iraqi base at Fao and a race in armaments. If the Persians wanted that, they had better say so. 10. Dr. Naji made a record of this talk and proposed (to Nuri Pasha) to send us a copy. Nuri Pasha said that, while he was quite willing that its substance should be conveyed verbally to us, he thought it inadvisable to send us the verbatim written copy. 11. Dr. Naji then told me (and this has since been confirmed both by Nuri Pasha and Edmonds) that quite recently Tevfik Riistii asked Muzahim Pachachi to call on him in Geneva. During the ensuing talk, Tevfik said that Turkey recognised the validity of the Treaty of Erzerum, but not the validity of the 1913 protocol. Recognition of this latter instrument would be impossible) because the recent Turco-Persian frontier arrangement would, in that case, become null and void, and this would mean that the Turks would probably have to give back to the Persians about 100 villages that had come to Turkey under the recent agreement. 12. Later Tevfik Riistii asked Muzahim to stay to lunch, and it then appeared that he had invited the Persian representative also. Tevfik repeated what he had told Muzahim, but without tilling tjie Persian that Turkey recog nised the validity of the Treaty of Erzerum. - - 13. Dr. Naji agreed with me in thinking that the whole interview was a put-up job. 14. In any case, his view is that, if the Russians and the Turks refuse, at Geneva, to recognise the protocol of 1913, it will not be because they are uncon vinced of its legality, but because their actual yolitical interests will suffer. There have been indications that Litvinov will side with the Turks and Persians at Geneva. If they do, the reason will be obvious. By weakening our position in the Gulf and in South Persia, their position in the north will be correspondingly strengthened. 15. Incidentally Dr. Naji pointed this out to the Persian Minister, but the latter pooh-poohed the idea. 16. It now appears from Edmonds’s private letter to you of the 25th December that Tevfik Riistu has been talking in the same.strain to the Iraqi Minister at Angora. Naji Shaukat has telegraphed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Tevfik has professed chagrin at the rejection by Iraq of his proposal to internationalise the Shatt. He even referred to Persia as Turkeys ally, and Nuri Pasha is going to ask point-blank what this means when he sees Ismet in Angora on the 29th December. C. H.

SINCE the late middle ages the frontier between the Persian and Turkish Empires has, speaking generally, followed in its southern sector the line of division between the Iranian plateau and the Mesopotamian plain and in its northern sector the watershed between Lakes Urumiah (now Rezaiyeh) and Van. The exact line of this frontier has, however, been the cause of incessant quarrels between the two Empires. 2. The first recorded attempt to fix the frontier by agreement is a treaty concluded between Sultan Murad IV and Shah Sefi in 1639. It was in very general terms and did little more than consecrate the natural geographical division described in the preceding paragraph. According to the best available translation of this instrument, its concluding article stated that the Shah should not interfere with the “ fortresses, burghs, provinces, countries, mountains or hills lying on the side of Akhaltsik, Kars, Van, Cherizul, Bagdad and Basra. 3. Further treaties concluded in 1728, 1732, 1736, 1746, 1747 and 1822 did little except confirm the division of 1639. 4. In 1837 the Pasha of Bagdad attacked and razed to tlm ground the town of Mohammerah, which belonged to the Arab tribe of the Ka ab, wh^e allegiance, though of a very uncertain kind, was probably due to Persia. Persians on their side attacked and captured the town of Suleimanieh m 1840. These and other hostilities did not, however, lead to a general outbreak of wai between the two countries, which was only threatened by the massing of Persian troops for an attack on Bagdad in the summer of 1842. 5. At this stage Great Britain and Russia intervened at Constantinople to persuade the Turkish Government, whom they seem to have regarded as the more aggressive party, to accept a peaceful solution. 6. As a result a joint commission composed of Turkish an ^ Pe rs i an plenipotentiaries, and of representatives of Great Britain and Russia as “ mediating Powers,” met at Erzerum in May 1843. It was apparently agree —though not in writing—that the status quo should meanwhile be preserved on the frontier. 7733 [10996] BAfter four weary years of negotiation the so-called “ Treaty 0 f Erzerum ” was signed by the Persian and Turkish Commissioners on the 31st May, 1847. The important articles of this treaty were as follows Article 2 . Le Gouvernement de Perse s’engage a abandonner au Gouvernement ottoman tous les terrains plats, c’est-a-dire les terrains de la partie occidentale de la province de Zohab; et le Gouvernement ottoman sWat?e de son cote, a abandonner au Gouvernement de Perse la partie oriental c’est-a-dire tous les terrains montagneux de la province de Zohab avec la vallee de Kirind. Le Gouvernement persan se desiste de toute espece de pretention relative a la ville et a la province de Suleymaniyye, et s’engage formellement a ne jamais exercer nulle espece d’immixtion ni d’empietement par rapport au droit de souverainete du Gouvernement ottoman sur ladite province. Le Gouvernement ottoman s’engage formellement a ce que la ville et I’echelle de Mohammara, Tile de Khizr [i.e., Abadan], le lieu d’ancrage, et aussi les terrains de la rive orientale, c’est-a-dire de la rive gauche du Schatt-el-Arab, qui sont en la possession des tribus reconnues comme relevant de la Perse, soient dans la possession du Gouvernement persan en pleine souverainete. Outre cela, les navires persans auront le droit de navimier en pleine liberte sur le Schatt-el-Arab, depuis 1’endroit ou ce fleuve se jette dans la mer, jusqu’au point de contact des frontieres des deux parties. Article 3. - Les deux parties contractantes ayant, par le present traite, abandonne leurs autres reclamations territoriales, s’engagent a nommer immediatement des deux cotes des commissaires et des ingenieurs, afin que ceux-ci determinent les frontieres entre les deux Etats d’une maniere conforme a 1’article precedent. Article 9 stated that all provisions of previous treaties remained in force except where specially modified or annulled by the present treaty. The ratifications of this treaty were exchanged at Constantinople on the 21st March, 1848. ^ 8. In accordance with Article 3 of the treaty, Persian and Turkish Commissioners, with British and Russian Commissioners as mediators, duly met at Mohammerah in 1850, and at Zohab in 1851 and 1852. In each case the mtransigeance of the iurkish Commissioner rendered an agreement impossible, and m each case the mediating commissioners submitted to their Governments, ±oi the consideration of the Turkish and Persian Governments, maps showing e limits claimed by the Turkish and Persian Governments and the compromise winch they, as mediators, recommended. + r ^^ le ? e recon ] men( iations led to no immediate agreement, but both sides agieed to the continued maintenance of the status quo along the frontier ^ I1 f ia L a n n ar T^ n gement which, in fact, left the town and Sheikhdom of Mohammerah m Persian possession. 10. The mediating commissioners thereafter devoted their attention to the compilation of a map of the frontier, and in 1853 the British Commissioner (Loionei Williams) returned to England, leaving an assistant (Captain Glascott, .) o cany on the work. It was Colonel Williams’s intention to draw up, in concer wi h his Russian colleague, a report embodying their opinions and emmons upon every point of the frontier. Most unfortunately all his notes were lost m the Ihames ana no report ever appeared. The woik of map-making proceeded very slowly, and for various reasons it was not until 1869 that a map (on the scale of 1 : 73,050), since known r f e dentic Map, was ready for presentation by the British and Russian Governments to the Turkish and Persian Governments. The presentation took at ^ on stantmople m 1869, and at Tehran in 1870. The map showed a Covprnmpm^ 0 to miles in width, and it was explained to the Turkis G 18 Majesty s representative at Constantinople in October P3 raemeit p® { ®tje droit b. iroitobfe des d®[? r, Persiiai ; rs as mediate’ an agreemeii' jdtotlieii^ emmeDfe if : a D ts and is that the mediating Powers expected the Persian and Turkish Governments to agree upon and demarcate the exact line of the frontier within this zone, bnt that in the event of any difference arising between them as to any particular locality, the points in dispute should be referred to the Governments of England and Russia, according to the treaty of Erzerum. A similar communication was made by the Russian representative (who said that in a case of disagreement the two Governments reserved their right “a interposer leurs bons offices en vertu du role de mediateur, qui leur est devolu par le traite d’Erzerum ”) and by the British and Russian representatives in Tehran. 12. In the meanwhile, the Persian and Turkish Governments had, on the 3rd August, 1869, signed an agreement for the preservation of the status quo c&lt; such as was defined by the commissioners of the four Powers ” until the frontier was finally settled. But in the absence of any authoritative interpretation of the status quo this agreement failed to prevent further disputes. 13. Persian and Turkish commissioners met in 1874 at Constantinople, in order to carry out the delimitation of the frontier on the basis of the “Identic Map ” of 1869, and when they failed to reach agreement were joined throughout 1875 and 1876 by British and Russian commissioners. Nothing came of this commission, except that the British Commissioner (General Sir Arnold Kemball), laid down on a map (which cannot now be traced), for the information of his own Government, the line of frontier which he considered fair to both sides. 14. It is unnecessary to describe the subsequent disputes about Kotour (which lies on what is still the frontier between Persia and Turkey), and Lahidjan and Vazne, which occurred in 1879-84, 1889-94, and 1905-12. Although these disputes gave an immense amount of trouble to all concerned, they did not give rise to any agreements or pronouncements affecting the juridical basis of the frontier, except that, as a reward for Persian neutrality in the Russo-Turkish War, Russia secured the insertion of articles (which, however, remained ineffective) in the treaties of San Stefano and Berlin providing ^ for the cession to Persia by Turkey of the town and district of Kotur as determined by the mixed Anglo-Russian commission for the delimitation of the frontiers of Turkey and Persia.” 15 16 15. On the 21st December, 1911, however, a Protocol was signed at Tehran by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Turkish Ambassador providing for the assembly of a Turco-Persian commission at Constantinople and for the submission of any points on which the commissioners could not agree within six months to The Hague Court. It was expressly stated that the commission should take as its basis the articles of e lea y o Erzerum. 16. The commission duly assembled in March 1912, and held eighteen sessions. 17. A great deal of time was taken up at the outset m discussions as to 11 ' the meaning of Article 9 of the Treaty of Erzerum which confirmed al the provisions of previous treaties, which were not specia y 1 ' ! ' 1 1 - i i- i llSfc by the present treaty). The Persian delegates maintained that th s article did not apply to frontier questions, which were entirely covere y ^ &gt;attl and that wherever these articles left room for doubi re aoTeen ^ en t 4^ confirmed by the mediating commissioners in 18o - , an ■ i other hand t: of 1869, must be accepted as final. The Turkish delegates on M maintained that Artide 9 covered Artmles 2 and 3, andMhafi wherever Ui^e left room for doubt, the treaty of 1639 must prevai . throughout t ] ie were, in fact, those that had been held by Persia an 0 £ &amp; ^ dispute, though it is probable that, “^ferlnce 0 between them lould amount status quo and the treaty of 1639, tne uinere ^ to very little. . i nf 18. Simultaneously with the meetings of this commission,^a ^ x u ?kish views began between the British and Russia Pourt being avoided Government, which ended in a reference t 0 The Hague Court ^ and the acceptance by the Turkish Goveinmei c &lt; November 1913, signed in the so-called “ Constantinople Protocol of the 17th November, rui ^ g [10996] , X4 by representatives of Turkey, Persia, Great Britain and Russia, and in a m referred to therein. This protocol, which was an instrument entiref consequential on the difficulties which had arisen in connection with tJ execution of the validly ratified treaty of Erzerum, and was therefore in th nature of a corollary to that instrument, provided for the delimitation of the frontier on the ground by a commission of the four Powers, and stated in Article 5 :— “ Des qu’une partie de la frontiere aura ete delimitee, cette partie sera consideree comme fixee definitivement et ne sera susceptible ni d’examen ulterieur ni de revision.” 19. The commission assembled at Mohammerah in January 1914 and completed its work by October 1914. It settled the line of the frontier in detail throughout its whole length, with the exception of a section opposite Kotour (which does not concern the present Perso-Iraqi frontier), and recorded its work in 87 protocols, and a ct Tableau descriptif ” of the boundary pillars which they erected. This description was supported by a line drawn upon ten sets of photographic reproductions of the relevant sheets of the “ Identic Map ” of 1869 and upon ten sets of 25 sheets of a “ carte supplementaire,” prepared to illustrate the line in sections which were not shown in sufficient detail on the “Identic Map.” Each sheet of each set of these maps was signed by the four commis sioners. The 1914 delimitation was in general conformity with the treaty of Erzerum, in so far as the latter can be said to have laid down a definite frontier at all. 20. As a result of the Great War of 1914—18 the Mesopotamian provinces of Turkey became detached from the Turkish Empire and were formed into the independent kingdom of Iraq, in which, however, mandatory authority was eX 5 r r^ SeC ^ His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom until the 3rd October, 1932, when, with the admission of Iraq to membership of the League of Nations, the mandatory regime came to an end. Iraq thus became fully independent, but became an ally of the United Kingdom in virtue of a Treaty of Alliance signed on the 30th June, 1930. 'H- the 9th August, 1919, on the occasion of the signature of the abortive Anglo-Persian Agreement, Sir Percy Cox, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, addressed the following letter to the Persian Prime Minister :— T • : • A s further evidence of the goodwill by which the Cabinet of .London is inspired, I am now authorised to inform your Highness that, h the event of the agreement regarding projects of reform which your Govern ment contemplate introducing in Persia being concluded, His Britannic a JU^y s Government will be prepared in due course to co-operate with the ei sian Government with a view to the realisation of the following desiderata :— # 3 The rectification of the frontier of Persia at the points where it is agreed upon by the parties to be justifiable. ^j 16 m anner, time and means to be chosen for pursuing these aims shall be discussed as soon as practicable, by the two Governments.” x&gt; ^ Ji 1 P ursuanc e °i this intention Eiruz Mirza (Nosret-ed-Dowleh), t Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, came to London and explained t] Jf 11 i m T Q a 5?P lratlons of Persia to Lord Curzon in great detail in the autun rp i ' in cluded the acquisition of considerable areas in Sista urmsan, lans-Caucasia and Turkish Kurdistan and opposite Zofo (i.e., Khamqm) and Firuz Mirza expressed the hope that His Majesty Government would support these claims at the forthcoming conference to decu e ci ms ° e tieaty of peace with Turkey. He was informed that most ( em ay ou bide the scope of the conference, and were in any case quil chimerical, but Lord Curzon wrote him on the 19th December, 1919 1 :— I am, however, as I had the honour of telling your Highness on previous occasions, prepared to do what may be possible, after full examina- 1011 of the geographical and ethnographical features of the case, to gi ve^ii support to yom Grovernment s interests on the western frontier of Persia for the reason that their claim in that quarter, apart from the question of their intrinsic justifications, concern the future disposition of Ottoman territory, which it is the special province of the Peace Conference to decide.” At this time, the disposal of the territories taken from Turkey was still a subject of debate. ““Mil I 'pilisii flpte ill 23. Firuz Mirza subsequently sent to the President of the Supreme Council a memorandum recapitulating very fairly the long frontier struggle between Persia and Turkey and asking for rectification, not on the ground that the frontier of 1913-14 was invalid, but on the ground that it was unjust:— “. . . . Malgre le travail tres important effectue par la commission le district de Kotour reste non delimite a cause de Fopposition turque: Fin justice de certaines classes du protocole final a Fegard de la Perse fut reconnue par les commissaires britannique et russe : enfin, le changement complet de la situation politique rend inutiles maints compromis que la Perse, mue exclusivement par Fesprit de conciliation et de deference aux instances des Puissances mediatrices, avait alors acceptes.” t® nr The rectification which Persia desired, and which affected no part of the frontier south of Mendeli, was then described in great detail. The communication of this memorandum led, however, to no result. It should, moreover, be borne in mind that all the proceedings of this period have been repudiated by the present Persian regime. 24. In the years following the Great War frontier disputes continued to occur between Persia and Turkey and Persia and Iraq. mi offc : id t 25. The disputes between Persia and Turkey were finally ended by an Agreement signed at Tehran on the 23rd January, 1932. This agreement defined a frontier which followed the line of the 1914 delimitation (though without referring to that delimitation or to the pillars erected by it), except in three places. In two of these the Turks acquired small additional areas of territory (in one case an area of which they were already in de facto possession) and in the third surrendered it. 26. The disputes between Persia and Iraq were partly responsible for the failure of the Persian Government formally to recognise Iraq for many years. This recognition eventually took place in 1929, but only after His Majesty s Minister in Tehran had on the 11th March, 1929, given the Persian Minister of Court the following assurance :— j ce .... si votre gouvernement est maintenant pret a reconnaitre 1 Irak, mon gouvernement, ayant appris en detail du gouvernement persan les difficultes pratiques qui surgissent de 1 Etat actuel des choses dans Chatt el-Arab, et les garanties qu’il desire, pretera ses bons offices vis-a-vis le gouvernement irakien pour aider la Perse a obtenir ses deman des raisonnables.” 27. From 1929 to 1934 the Persian Government, while ignoring the 1913-14 frontier throughout its length, made no attempt to explain to His Majesty s Government in the United Kingdom their practical difficulties m the bha -e- Arab. His Majesty’s Government, nevertheless, concerted with the Iraqi Govern ment in formulating a scheme for the establishment of a tripartite Conservancy Board, which should control the conservancy and navigation of the river and satisfy (so it was hoped) the legitimate aspirations of the Persian Governmen for a larger share in its control. 28. The draft of a Conservancy Board Convention was accordingly communicated to the Persian Minister of Court in May 1932, and «ne Gme there appeared to be some hopes of its acce P tar [ ce J .^, t ^ ee f Sia1 ^- 0 f More recently, however, that Government have indicated a no &amp; /i; • w territorial sovereignty up to the thalweg (or alternatively up p e ra aquw) of the Shatt-el-Arab will be sufficient, and the behaviour of their nav , police, customs and other authorities upon the frontier has s e y provocative.29. This behaviour eventually led the Iraqi Government to the conclusion l 1 l il f* J * _ -i_ — _ ^ ^ ^ 1 J 1 t -r U y~» /-w /-v 4- 4- 1 y-v yd T-r -w-v y-» -«y^ 1 1 l 1 T ''H valid. Such acts of the Persian Government as could be regarded as part of deliberate policy to ignore the frontier were accordingly embodied in a letter dated the 29th November, 1934, from the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, and its several appendices. The ^ letter was subsequently placed upon the provisional agenda of the session of the Council of the League beginning on the 11th January, 1935. 30. The reply of the Persian Government is not yet known in detail, but is understood to be to the effect that the Persian Government do not recognise as valid the Protocol of 1913 and the delimitation of 1914 and that the frontier in the Shatt-el-Arab is contrary to natural justice. Their non-recognition of the frontier instruments will probably be based on : (a) The assertion that neither Turkey nor Persia were free agents in the conclusion of these instruments; (b) The absence of ratification by the Persian Majlis; (c) The failure of Turkey to carry out the whole of the requirements of the 1913 Protocol; (d) The reservations made by Persia when Iraq entered the League of 31. Points (b), (c) and (d) of the preceding paragraph are considered in Section 6. With regard to (a), it is undeniable that Great Britain and Russia used their influence with both Persia and Turkey at various times to prevent the question of the frontier leading to hostilities, and the Treaty of Erzerum and the Protocol of 1913 cannot be said to have given either party their heart’s desire. But it is also fair to say that the influence of the mediatory Powers was nearly j always needed to restrain Turkey and protect Persia, and even if the latter was sometimes required, in the interests of peace, to make concessions which seemed to her unnecessary or unjust, it is highly probable that the concessions would have been tar larger if she had had to face Turkey unaided. 2. The Explanatory Note ” and the Ratification of the Treaty of Erzerum. The Treaty of Erzerum, consisting of nine articles, was signed by Turkish • w . . . ’ ctrLiuies, was sini and Persian plenipotentiaries at Erzerum on the 31st May, 1847. as assurai 3 ces &gt; onl y the first affects the question of the frontier. It was m the following form : les suiva^ts* 0 ^ 8 8U1 ^ es( ^ ue ^ s Sublime Porte reclame des explications sont ^ ^ &gt;or ^ e 1 su PP 0S e qu’en abandonnant, d’apres Tune des * The word “ situ^es ” is us Persian Envoy in January 1848. is used instead of “ comprises ” in the extract communicated to thele Sultan, ayant ete produits des deux parts ont ete collationnes et trouves 1 exactement conformes et en bonne et due forme, apres quoi l echange dej deux ratifications a ete formellement effectue entre leurs Excellences lesdits plenipotentiaires et en presence des deux representants susmentionnes.

Aali. c ‘ (L.S.) “(L.S.) “ (L.S.) ) 10 Mehemed Ali. Cowley. Titow.” 7. It will be noted that this Protocol makes no reference to the explanatory note.” 8. Subsequently, however, the Turkish Government continued to maintaia that the “ explanatory note ” was for them an integral part of the treaty. For instance, the Turkish representative on the Delimitation Commission (Darvish Pasha) rendered the work of the commission at Mohammerah in 1850 entirely nugatory through the interpretation which he attached to the assurance of the mediating Powers respecting the lands to be held by Persia on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, and as late as 1875 the Turkish Government made their acceptance of the association of British and Pussian commissioners with the Turkish and Persian commissioners then meeting at Constantinople dependent on an assurance from the British Ambassador (which was given) that the “explanatory note” would be regarded as no less formal an instrument than the treaty itself. 9. The Persian Government, however, always declined to recognise the explanatory note ’ ’ and declared that Mahomed Ali Khan had no authority to make the declaration of the 21st January, 1848, accepting this note. 10. Even as late as the negotiations preceding the signature of the Constantinople Protocol of the 17th November, 1913, the question was still to the fore At the first of the sessions of the Turco-Persian Commission held in 1912 the Turkish delegates asked their Persian colleagues to accept the “ explanatory ^ 1 °i! e u 18 ifGgotiations. This the Persian delegates refused to do, as rt had been stipulated in the Protocol of the 21st December, 1911, that the treaty of Erzerum was to form the basis of the commission's w r ork, and no mention had been made of the explanatory note.' The Turkish delegates insisted, however, on the ground that the note was an integral part of the Treaty. Eventually the senior Persian delegate, acting on the advice of the British and Russian Ambas sadors, communicated the Persian acceptance of the note to his Turkish colleagues, and though the Persian Government subsequently disavowed his action, the negotiations continued. There can xx. xiicic uctu ue no doubt tnat, notwithstanding the attitude ot ersian commissioner at Mohammerah in 1850, the two Ambassadors who si£ e explanatory note” regarded it as changing nothing in the treaty. But w ether the words of the note are or are not compatible with the treaty is not rea ^al.to-day, as nothing in it affects the present dispute. The only possible exception is the description of the “anchorage” at Mohammerah, which was clearly intended to consist of the Haffar Canal only, whereas, by the protocol ot 1913, 1 ersia was given an area in the Shatt-el-Arab itself extending I? 1 2 ldd i e ot i 6 river for a certain distance above and below the entrance of the Haffar Canal. 12 notwithstanding the attitude 12. Though this point is of interest as an illustration of the views of the powers w ich bi ought the treaty of Erzerum into being, it seems quite immaterial from the point of view of the Iraqi Government whether the explanatory note is held ever to have been in force or not.

The flat country lying between the Iranian plateau and the Shatt-el- Arab, which now forms the Persian province of Khuzistan (or Arabistan, as it was called until a few years ago), is geographically a continuation of the Mesopotamian plain, the greater part of which is now comprised in the Arab Kingdom of Iraq, and has always been inhabited by tribes of an Arab, rather than an Iranian, character. 2. It is probable that when the Treaty of 1639 was concluded this area was not under the effective control of either the Turks or the Persians, but that, nevertheless, the acknowledged dependencies of Basra, with which the treaty forbade the Shah of Persia to interfere, included the country on both banks of the river. 3. At a later period the authority of the Pasha of Basra extended as far as Kuban (or what is now called Bander Shahpur, on the Khor Musa), but at the time of the sacking of the town of Mohammerah by the Pasha in 1837, the Arab tribe of the Ka’ab (or Cha’ab), which occupied Mohammerah itself and most of the country on the left bank of the river, were probably dependants of Persia rather than of Turkey. This at any rate seems to be the best interpretation of the evidence, although the authorities are far from unanimous on the point, and a dispossessed chief of the Ka’ab, who appeared before the Erzerum commission, stated that he had always paid tribute to the Pasha of Basra. 4. The position of the territory on the north-eastern side of the Shatt-el- Arab in 1844 was summed up by His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople (in a comprehensive report upon the frontier question written for the information of His Majesty’s Government on the 27th April of that year) in the following words :•— “ The whole results in a presumption that the original territorial right is in favour of Turkey, and the right of conquest and possession is in favour of Persia.” 5. In any case the Treaty of Erzerum of 1847 gave to Persia Mohammerah, the island of Abadan (then known as Khizr), the anchorage of Mohammerah (he., the Haffar Canal joining the Karun to the Shatt) and all lands on the left bank of the river which were in the possession of tribes dependent on Persia. 6. When the Mixed Commission for the Demarcation of the Frontier met at Mohammerah in 1850, the Turkish Commissioner claimed, on the strength oi the “explanatory note” (see Section 2) that Persia was only entitled to Mohammerah and the island of Khizr {i.e., Abadan), and that the whole or tie surrounding country, which he said was occupied by tribes dependent on lurkey, should be assigned to Turkey. 7. The mediating commissioners considered, however, that such an mgement, which would have created a small enclave of I ersian territory m middle of an expanse of Turkish territory, was quite impracticable.^ Ibey &gt; took a different view of the relevant section of the explanatory no e, w ic i '&lt;f understood to refer only to the limits of Persian territory on e e an v veen Mohammerah and Basra. In the end they propose &amp; comprom itier, similar in most essentials to that existing to-day m a i o ^ left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, but less favourable to Persia m ^at it gave less territory above Mohammerah and no rights ovei any par , erway in'the vicinity of that port. This frontier was no orma y P lurkey till 1913. 8. Whatever the rights or wrongs of the Turkish s clear that the assignment to Persia of Mohammerah an rpo . ar u p a p v di as Abadan Island) on the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab was regarde 'key at any rate :* (a) as Persian intrusion into tern orv n ^ no previous footing, and (b) as acceptable only if vl ^wet a • t ig 0 f sian abandonment of other territory further I l or • oi,. i_\ ra b s j nce &gt;ortance in any consideration of the ownership of [10996] Cthe Turkish view was that previously to 184/ Persia had never possessed recognised legal right to any territory adjoining the left bank of the river had consequently never had even a pretence to sovereignty over the river M? Such a view finds some support in the fact that even prior to 1847 p 86 vessels using the river did in fact have to pay dues to the Ottoman authoriti^ 1 an es. 9. Throughout these proceedings Turkey consistently maintained her cl ' to sovereignty over the whole of the river. For instance, during the discussin 1Kl which had preceded the conclusion of the treaty of Erzerum, the Turkish Go ^ ment had communicated to the British and Russian Ambassadors (in March X the text of a communication setting forth their attitude on various questio which they intended the Turkish Commissioner at Erzerum should give to p 8 Persian colleague. This read in part as follows :— Le Gouvernement ottoman a consent! a laisser a la Perse Mohammerali avec File sur laquelle il se trouve, ainsi que de la rive gauche de Chatt-el-Arab la partie qui se trouve aujourd’hui en la possession des habitants reconnus comme dependants de la Perse, .... avec la faculte de la fibre navigation du fleuve; mais cette disposition ne doit porter aucune atteinte au droit de possession de la Sublime Porte du fleuve susdit dont le cours continnera d’appartenir entierement et exclusivement a la Sublime Porte qui n’a accorde a la Perse que la liberte du passage de ses batiments qui naviguent sur le fleuve. Et afin qu’il ne soit porte atteinte dans aucun temps absolument au droit de la Sublime Porte a la possession du fleuve susdit, il ne devra jamais etre eleve des fortifications sur aucune partie de la cote ’qui resteraa la Perse.” 10. Although this communication was never made, the Turkish Government being eventually satisfied with the “ explanatory note ” fwhich does not, however, Tf/P y . reference . t0 the river itself &gt;- the Turkish Government in noway- abated their pretensions, and the express provision in Article 2 of the Treaty of rzeiuni lor the free navigation of the river by Persian vessels, i.e .:— ....

' w ^ this conclusion the mediating commissioners, as well as the British and Kussian officials responsible for the Treaty of Erzerum may have been influenced by the fact that in those days the Bahmanshir was still the principal outlet of the Karan and more or less navigable : and by the view which was widely held, that it was only fair that Persia should have exclusive control of the outlet of the Persian river of the Karun and Turkey of the outlet of the Turkish rivers of the 1 igns and Euphrates. 16. The Bahmanshir, however, rapidly deteriorated as a channel of naviga tion, and even in the same year as the commissioners laid down the compromise frontier no reference to this argument was made by Lord Palmerston when recapitulating (on the 12th July, 1850) the history of the frontier neo- 0 tiations for the benefit of His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg. In this°despatch he stated that: The Porte at first objected that Mohammerah and the neighbouring districts had heretofore been Turkish territory, but had been wrongfully seized upon by Persia in 1841. Eventually, however, the Porte agreed to the article respecting Mohammerah with the understanding that the concession was not to affect the Porte’s right of property to the river, the course of which was still to belong wholly and exclusively to the Porte, which only granted freedom of passage to Persian vessels; and in order to secure the Porte’s rights, it was secured that no fortifications should be raised on any part of the river banks remaining in the possession of Persia.” 17. Unlike the Turkish Government, the Persian Government accepted the frontier laid down by the mediating commissioners, and the terms of their acceptance, which was conveyed in a letter from the Prime Minister (the Amir Nizam) to the British and Russian representatives at Tehran on the 25th May, 1850, are of importance in that no reservation is made regarding sovereignty over the river itself :— C£ 2. First, with regard to Mohammerah, it is distinctly stated in the Treaty that the town and port of Mohammerah, the island of Khizr, the anchorage-ground and the land on the East, or left of the Shatt-el-Arab, inhabited by tribes known to belong to Persia, should remain in the possession of the Persian Government. But the line of the frontier proposed by the mediating commissioners, according to the map they have sent, does not in any way agree with the terms of the treaty, because the line drawn by the mediating commissioners on the side of the Persian Gulf commences at the Shatt-el-Arab and runs westward in the direction of the port of Fyleeah, known by the name of the Fort of Hajee Jaber, and from thence to Kasreyn. Now from the west side of Fyleeah to the Koot-i-Tamar and above it, according to the proposed line, reside many tribes known to belong to Persia, and that land therefore ought to remain in the possession of Persia, but out of regard to the friendship of the two great mediating Powers and the commissioners appointed to define the frontier, the Persian Ministers consent to and ratify this new line on two conditions :— “ 3. First—after the line proposed by the mediating commissioners is established as the frontier boundary, that no new explanations or future demands which are contrary to the treaty, shall be pressed on the Persian Ministers £C 4. Second—that in marking the frontier-line on the west side of the fort of Fyleeah in the direction of Koot-i-Tamar to Kasreyn whatever tribes known to belong to Persia shall remain on that (Turkish) side of the fi ontier line shall, according to the terms of the treaty, be restored to Persia, wit ou any pretexts, excuses or claims to them being advanced. And while e commissioners are on the spot this point shall be settled by a wri en ocu [10996] c 212 ment. Otherwise, according to the stipulations of the treaty, the Persian Government will have a right to claim both the land and the tribes; andthi mediation on the part of the commissioners shall only relate to the frontier between Fyleeah and Kasreyn.” With regard to these conditions, it can be said of the first that no further “ demands ” were made, and of the second that Persia has in fact since acquired the area of which she considered herself wrongfully dispossessed. 18. The question of sovereignty in the Shatt-el-Arab seems to have remained quiescent from 1850 to about 1908. 19. In that year His Majesty’s Government, being apprehensive of Turkish encroachments on the possessions of the Sheikh of Mohammerah (the chief in modern times of the Ka’ab tribe), informed His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople that— “ In the Mohammerah district His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to recognise any other frontier than that laid down by the mediating commissioners in 1850. . . . Any disturbance of the status quo at Mohammerah would affect British interests and might not improbably lead to the active intervention of His Majesty’s Government, who have given the Sheikh certain assurances as to his territory.” 20. As it happened, no warning to the Turkish Government on these lines proved necessary, but His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah (Lieutenant, and afterwards Sir Arnold, Wilson) and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Sir Percy Cox) pointed out that there was, in fact, a discrepancy between the mediating commissioners’ line and the status quo. 21. I he discrepancies in question were that according to the status quo— (a) the centre of the river, and not the left bank, was the recognised frontier. (5) the land frontier left the river at a point about 6 miles westwards, or up-stream, from the point indicated by the mediating commissioners. 22. His Majesty’s Government considered that it was impossible to disregard the mediating commissioners’ line, whatever the status quo might be, especially as it was directly or indirectly the sole protection for the interests of the Persian Government on other parts of the frontier; and they eventually suggested a compromise whereby Turkey should be confirmed in her rights over the whole of the river in return for her relinquishment of any claim to the lands above Mqhammerah then held by Persia in advance of the mediating commis sioners line, and the grant to Persia of an anchorage in the Shatt-el-Arab itself opposite Mohammerah. 23. This compromise was communicated to the Turkish Ambassador in Lonclon on the 18th July, 1912, accepted unofficially by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 9th September, 1912, confirmed in the so-called eclaration by Sir Edward Grey and Hakky Pasha of the 29th July, 1913. and eventually embodied in the Constantinople Protocol of the 17th November, lyie). 24. The relevant portion of the note of the 18th July, 1912, to the Turkish Government ran as follows :— From the point where the locally-observed frontier leaves the Khaiyin Canal and, opposite the Nahr Nazaileh, enters the main channel of the att-el-Arab it [i.e., the ‘ locally observed ’ or status quo frontier] follows e medium filum aquce of the Shatt-el-Arab down to the Persian Gulf (see maps Nos. 3 and 4). This line of demarcation is in accordance with the general presump tion that, where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous states, the middle of the channel or £ thalweg ’ is the actual line of separation between those two States. Such a presumption may, however, be swept away, either by proof of pi lor occupancy and long undisturbed possession on the part of one of the two States, or by express treaty stipulation.13 Si first Mok _ iiiu ^ ^Wsil iidentiilfe a dim* If irdingtotiS astlerafii )ut it it was if tk status pi ic-tioD fcrtfe ier; asii tor firmed in itierl^f; etmlH** tie f -e ^ The recoids of the past ^00 years, as contained in the official archives of the East India Company and of His Majesty’s Government are far from supporting any claim on the part of Turkey to ‘ prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession of the Shatt-el-Arab; while no express stipulatioS is contained m the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) as to the ownership of the river. “If, therefore, His Majesty’s Government had strict regard either to purely local considerations or to the letter of the treaties, they would not hesitate to press for the frontier as locally recognised along its whole length from Hawizeh to the Persian Gulf. But they prefer to look at the negotia tions m which they are now engaged as a whole, and are sincerely anxious to arrive at an arrangement which both parties can accept ex animo and which, by removing all points of grievance and friction not only between themselves, but also between the Sublime Porte and the Sheikh of Mohammei ah, will place the relations of all concerned on a thoroughly satisfactory footing. Provided, therefore, the Turkish Government will accept the frontier stotus quo as already indicated from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where the Khaiyin Canal and the Nahr Nazaileh enter the Shatt-el-Arab, then His Majesty’s Government are prepared to use their influence with the Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to recognise Turkish sovereignty over the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, subject to the following conditions : “ (i) The following islands to be recognised as within the territorial limits of Persia :—■ “(a) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh, the four islands situated between Shatait and Ma’awiyeh, and the two islands off Manquhi. These islands are, in fact, parts of the island of Abadan, and must be so regarded. “ (p) Any islands now in existence, or which may hereafter be formed, and which may be connected at low water either with Abadan Island or with the Persian bank below the Nahr Nazaileh. “ (ii) The arrangements proposed by His Majesty’s Government for maintaining full freedom of navigation on the river, and for its conservancy, to be accepted by the Ottoman Government. “ (iii) The modern port and anchorage of Mohammerah, which is in the main stream of the Shatt-el-Arab above and below its junction with the Karun, to be recognised as within Persian jurisdiction (see Map No. 2). “(iv) No interference to take place with existing fishing rights and usages on or from the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, that phrase being understood to comprise all land on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab or on the Persian islands therein which is uncovered at normal low tide. “ (v) Turkish jurisdiction not to extend to land on the Persian bank, defined as above, which is only temporarily covered with water in time of flood or from any accidental cause, and Persian jurisdiction not to extend to land which is temporarily or accidentally uncovered below low-water mark. “ (vi) The Sheikh of Mohammerah to continue in full enjoyment of his existing proprietary rights in lands situated in Turkish territory. 25. This compromise was also communicated by the Political Resident on the 20th August to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, who accepted it with gratitude, and to the Persian Government on the 29th August, 1912, by the Butish an Russian representatives in Tehran, who pointed out that this an angemen an certain adjustments in the north, with which the Russian Governmen weie primarily concerned, were valuable gains for Persia for which she migi t ave to pay in other sectors, e.y., Zohab. 26. The Persian Government did not reply ^ and then only in response to a joint note from the British an .Z 188 ! sentatives of the 27th October, 1913, urging early acceptance of thefavou a settlement that had by that time been reached regarding the whole frontier.14 27. The Persian note stated that the Persian Ambassador at Poncio *• mof orl Kir f ijl^irTT'o m f o i rvn 1 1 i . ^^tlHOpb had been instructed by telegram to sign the Protocol embodying ftA't 1 ” 0 !* and to introduce Etela-al-Mulk as Persian Commissioner h„t tif™ I do not think it superfluous here to bring to your Excellency’s the views of my Government regarding the protection of the sovem'L 7? and rights of navigation of the Persian Government ,,,, *v.., c, ,.' , 1 S* lts and rights of navigation of the Persian Government on the ShS'A undoubted rights/ ’ c0nvict ’ on of this Government as to the security oftfi 28.

His Majesty s Minister at Tehran on the 26th Decembe^ 1913 (as reported v the latter by telegram), that— ^ P 0rted ^ i ; • t ^ le Cabinet only agreed to accept the frontier settlement reached at Constantinople on condition that Persia’s sovereignty and navigation rights on the Shatt-el-Arab should be reserved. That this wat not done by the Persian Ambassador at Constantinople was due to the bad wording of the telegraphic instructions sent to him; now recognition of river rights only is asked for, which, as his Excellency pointed out, becomes a mere formality, when Persia is prepared formally to accept the Turkish River Commission with all the control it entails and to pay dues to be levied on Pei smn shipping. He urged that this concession to the amour-vrome of a btate having frontier on the river bank was not an exaggerated demand.” 5 ?l ver CQmmission is that referred to in paragraph 23 above.

So far as merchant ships are concerned, the Iraqi Government would therefore not be justified in an attempt to prevent them from anchoring in the Shatt-el-Arab without special permission. It is consequently not open to the Iraqi Government to prevent, or impose special conditions on, Persian vessels anchoring at Abadan, where, though the port is Persian, the anchorage is in Iraqi national waters. £ ‘ 4- There is, however, a fundamental difference between the rights of a merchant ship and the rights of a Persian warship to navigate the Shatt- el-Arab. The right of navigation accorded to Persia by the Treaty of Erzerum does not include the right of using Iraqi national waters' for military operations, such as the coercion of tribes on the Persian shore, and the Iraqi Government would be within their strict legal rights in refusing to allow Persian warships to anchor in the Iraqi national waters without permission. At the same time, Persian warships have the right of passing over Iraqi national waters in order to reach the Persian port of Mohammerah.” It is important from the point of view of the Persian Government that their ships should be able to use Mohammerah as a naval base, as the constant change from fresh to salt water means that their ships need much less frequent scraping than would otherwise be the case and there is no other Persian fresh-water port. :e meionfe Persia cb policed; imfj 34. The proposed tripartite Conservancy Board Convention has been mentioned in Section 1. It is only necessary to mention here that, although the Persian Government does not derive any revenue from shipping passing up the Shatt-el-Arab, they do not, on the other hand, have any expenses in connexion with the river. Moreover, the Iraqi Government have so far made no profit for themselves from the dredging dues. 35. An argument of a general nature in favour of the view that Iraq should own the whole of the Shatt-el-Arab is that the Shatt-el-Arab is the sole outlet to the sea which Iraq possesses, whereas Persia has a coast-line of many hundreds of miles. 36. With regard to the question of the Shatt-el-Arab being “ unusual,’ it is true that it is usual to lay down the centre of a river (or alternatively the thalweg) as the line of the frontier when a river divides two States, and that in the absence of any express provision to the contrary the centre of the stream is usually held to be the frontier. But there is no reason in international law why a frontier should not follow the bank of a river, when there is any reason for its doing so, or why agreements to this effect should not be concluded. There are, in fact, agreements and frontiers of this kind in various parts of the world, though they are not numerous.4. Territorial Waters at the Mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab The “Tableau Descriptif ” prepared by the Frontier Commission of iqu states that:— ‘ “ “ La frontiere vient du large pour toucher la rive gauche du Chatt-el I Arab a un point situe a une distance de 2 milles en aval du fort appartenant actuellement au Cheikh Khazal (i.e., the Sheikh of Mohammerah) La position de ce fort a ete observee de la terrasse du bureau telegraphique Imperial ottoman de Fao, ou son azimut avec le nord fut constate etre de 87 degres.” which description, with the line drawn by the commission on the “ Identic Map” suggests was at that time the mouth of the river was very much nearer to Fan than at present. 2. The point so described is, however, some miles from what is now the mouth of the river and the question arises as to the proper line of the frontier below it. 3. This question was carefully examined in 1929, and the results summarised m the following paragraphs of a memorandum prepared in the Eastern Department on the 1st March, 1930 “ 2 . In accordance with the Treaty of Erzerum of 1847 and the Turco- Jreisian Fi on tier Protocol signed at Constantinople in 1913, the frontier on the bhatt-el-Arab follows the left (Persian) bank. The latter document provides that la frontiere suit le cours du Chatt-el-Arab jusqu’a la mer en aissant sous la squverainete ottomane le fleuve et toutes les iles qui s’y trouvent’ \\ it i certain conditions and exceptions. It also set up a delimitation commission, wnose decisions were to be definitive and not to be susceptible to revision. This commission delimited the frontier during 1914 starting from the south, and the S ° U i ^ 0in ^ frontier line is some miles upstream from what nugiit to-day have been considered to be the actual mouth of the river. • -^^ le is that below the end of the delimitation commission’s frontier me, an on each side of the river, there are two large mudbanks, which are at all events partly covered by the sea at high-tide, but on the other hand are at all ev ^ n ? J low-tide. These banks, the Abadan bank on the Persian side, ail a .oullah bank on the Iraq side, are continually changing their position am eir size, and at the request of the Foreign Office a special survey was under- v 1 1929 ’ on the results of which the Admiralty chart in 7 / showing the coast lines at low-water spring tides, is based. One imp 0 rtant result of this survey was to establish that large areas both of the u a an the Abadan banks have in fact a definite low-water line and must now, whatever the position was in 1914, be regarded as territory, i A i ' i e , ra&lt; I government, who naturally control navigation on the Shatt- fwK ’ mi 36 ?? ohh ^ t0 dredge a channel called the Pooka Channel through . outside the mouth of the river in order to enable ocean-going vessels to ? e l 1 ?? 1 \ c ? m jd le ^ ea - dhis channel passes very close indeed to a detached m ° i tlle Aba .d an bank (Persia) marked X on The plan* A part of the A lLr 1 r 01 1S \ t ^ la - n ^ m des away from the outermost point of the P ? n There is therefore a very serious danger that the Persian 1 J? 6 ? mi ght be able to make out a very good case for objecting to the thp pR n i r ° ° ^2°^ a Channel by Iraq on the grounds ( 1 ) that part of prLt!^?? el ^ as /^side Iraq territorial waters, and perhaps ( 2 ) part of the &lt;£ a ^if S 11381 - e ^? l 8 l a ^ erri t°rial waters (see paragraph 6 below) • i A remains to be considered how the frontier line may reasonably be considered to run down stream from the point where the 19i4 Delimitation rT S i ended ' Between th at point and the end of the Abadan and these Lnksw “T t 0 . 1 ” 3 httle , doubt as the position.

The question then arises of the boundary between Persia and Iraq territorial waters. There is no definite rule of international law which would govern the situation. It has, however, been suggested that it would be reasonable to draw one line joining the extreme ends of the Abdullah and the Abadan banks, and then to draw another line from the end of the Abadan bank following the general lie of the coast, and that the boundary between the two territorial waters would be the line which bisects the angle formed at the junction of these two lines. Unfortunately, however, there is some doubt as to the ‘ general lie of the coast ’ north of the end of the Abadan bank. Although the outer edge of the Abadan bank runs at first in a northerly direction, the Admiralty think it would be possible for Persia to claim that the coast should be regarded as running in an east-north-east direction. “7. As regards the Pooka Channel, the conclusion eventually reached as a result of interdepartmental correspondence was that it could reasonably be contended that the whole of the Channel, except a small portion of the eastern end, lies within Iraqi territorial waters. The eastern portion so far as it lies more than three miles from the Abdullah bank must be regarded probably as being partly Persian territorial waters and partly open sea. But the position is doubtful. It would be reasonable that the control of the whole of the Pooka Channel should rest with the authority responsible for the river. But in the absence of a generally recognised principle of international law governing the limitation of territorial waters of two riparian States at the mouth of a river, the result of a reference to arbitration could not be predicted with any certainty. “ 8. As regards the islet ‘ X ’ off the end of the Abadan bank, which is really a detached portion of the Abadan bank, it appears that Persia would find some support from the replies of the various countries to the League of Nations questionnaire in maintaining that this islet is Persian territory and that her territorial waters must be measured from it. (Basis of discussion No. 14 referred to in paragraphs 53-59 of the Report is in agreement with this view.) Iraq, on the other hand, might argue that even if this point had to be decided by the general rules of international law, the position would be uncertain; but that, in this instance, the matter was not left to be decided by the general rules of international law, for the governing factor in this case is the Constantinople Protocol of 1913, according to which islands which are not, even at low water, joined to Abadan Island are not Persian territory. To this Persia might reply that this argument could only apply to islands in the river and not to islands outside the mouth of the river. To some extent, therefore, the recognition of the rule comprised in the second paragraph of Basis 14 might assist Persia against Iraq with regard to any Persian claim to jurisdiction over part of the Pooka channel. “ 9. Generally speaking, it cannot be too strongly emphasised that the banks at the mouth of the river are constantly shifting and change their shape from year to year, and that no definite division of the waters based on their position can possibly be satisfactory or permanent. For this reason it has been suggested that Iraq would do well to claim the whole of the navigable river, wherever that may happen to be, on the ground of the text of the 1913 Protocol and the practical necessities of the situation.” 4. It is only necessary to add that since 1930 the position has been improved from the point of view of Iraq by the disappearance of islet X, a slight wearing away of the Abadan bank, and some building up of the Abdullah bank. The result of this may possibly prove to be that the whole of the channel lies m Ipbl 1 territorial waters or the open sea (assuming, of course, that the views of His Majesty’s Government as to the proper method of determining the division between territorial waters at the mouth of the river is correct). [10996] D18 5 . Zohab (the ‘‘ Transferred Territories ”). Apart from Mohammerah and the Shatt-el-Arab, the only part of what is now the Perso-Iraqi frontier that is still liable to give rise to serious difficulty is the district of Zohab, i.e., the district around Khaniqin and Qasr-i-Shirin. This district has always been of strategical importance on account of the main route ^ from Bagdad to Tehran wdiieh passes through it, and more recently has acquired an added importance from the discovery of oil. 2. Article 2 of the treaty of Erzerum stated that:— “ Le Gouvernement de Perse s’engage a abandonner au Gouvernement Ottoman tons les terrains plats, c’est-a-dire la partie occidentale, de la province de Zohab; et le Gouvernement Ottoman, de son cote, s’engage a abandonner au Gouvernement persan la partie orientale, c’est-a-dire tous les terrains montagneux de la province de Zohab. avec la vallee de Kirind.” It was nevertheless found necessary in 1912 and 1913 to provide for the with drawal of Persia from the western part of the district, of which she had been in occupation for a long period. The exact line to which the frontier was to be withdrawn in order to comply with the Treaty of Erzerum was consequently the subject of endless negotiations between the Turkish and Persian commissioners at Constantinople in 1912. 3. The area eventually evacuated by Persia under the 1913 Protocol is known as the “ Transferred territory,” and a special annex to the Protocol provided that within it the Anglo-Persian Oil Company should have all the rights vis-a-vis the Turkish Government that they would have had vis-a-vis the Persian Government if it had remained Persian. 4. The memorandum submitted by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to the President of the Supreme Council on the 9th January, 1920 (see Section 1), described in great detail the frontier rectification which Persia desired from Mendeli northwards. It quoted certain statements made by the British and Russian commissioners on the 26th May and the 14th October, 1914, regarding the pasturage of the Singali tribe and certain lands to the east of Baghche respectively, to show that the Protocol of 1913 was not always just to Persia, and went on to claim the whole of the Zohab district on architectural, if on no other, grounds :— La Perse reclame la totalite du district de Zohab, foncierement persan. Ees mines de Hook-Kourek, situees a Touest de la frontiere persane actuelle, et ayant le meme caractere que celles de Kasri-Chirine, attestent 1’unite de cette region meme a 1 epoque de 1’Empire des Sassanides.” It then desciibed the rectification which Persia desired as follows :— ,, T o .^ ^ yicte ue ujeoei-ixonnerig (a la nauteur ae menuen; jusqu a la riviere d Abi-Naft en conformite avec le trace de la commission de delimitation de 1914 (bornes Nos. 41-46).

The Persian Government proceeded to carry out the terms of the Protocol; they made, for instance, no attempt to prevent their commissioner from taking part in the work of the International Commission, and never at any time made any reference to any alleged need for ratification. 6. The commission met in January 1914 and ended its work in October 1914. With the exception of a section opposite Kotour (which is on what is still the Turco-Persian as opposed to the Iraqi-Persian frontier) it settled the line of the frontier definitely and finally throughout, erecting boundary pillars (which are generally taken to denote an immediate transfer or confirmation of sovereignty) where boundary pillars were required and recording its work in— (a) 87 Protocols, (b) A “ Tableau Descriptif ” of the frontier and the boundary pillars, (c) A number of maps, all of which were signed by the Persian Commissioner in concert with the other commissioners. 7. A point of very considerable importance is that the memorandum submitted by Firuz Mirza to the President of the Paris Peace Conference in January 1920, regarding Persia’s desire for a rectification of her western frontier, did not base any claim on the ground that the frontier settlement of 1913-14 required ratification, or that it was invalid (see Section 1). On the contrary, it spoke of the “ travail tres important ” of the commission, and asked for rectifica tion on grounds of equity alone. 7a. The question of validity was examined in 1921 and again in 1927 and 1928, and on each occasion the legal advisers of the Foreign Office reached the conclusion that there was no ground whatever for supposing that the Protocol of 1913 required ratification, or that the frontier laid down in 1914 was not legally valid frontier, which would, moreover, remain valid, even if the instruments which fixed it ceased to have effect. 8. Early in 1928 the Persian Minister of Court told His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that the Turkish Government, who refused to admit the validity of the 1913 Protocol, were in occupation of territory which by that Protocol should have belonged to Persia. This meant that Persia had never received the compensation which she was to have received for the surrenders of territory which she was forced to make in the southern (now the Iraqi) section, i.e., at Zohab and in the Shatt-el-Arab. It would be unnatural and unjust, he said, that Persia should remain bound by the Protocol while the other party ignored it, and the Protocol must therefore be deemed to have lapsed. This argument again w as based wholly on equity and in no way on the contention that the 1913 Protocol and 1913—14 delimitation were legally invalid. / re £ ap d to the point regarding the compensation due to Persi (winch has been elaborated many times since), the view of the Foreign Office k a ways been that, from the date of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lausani ^.e 1924) and of the Treaty of Angora of 1926, if not from a considerabl earlier date, Turkey ceased to be the territorial Sovereign of Iraq, and from tk nne lost all power to make any valid arrangements regarding the boundaries ( raq with any third power. The Kingdom of Iraq as one of the Turkis uccession States succeeded to the boundarv between Persia and Turkey as: was established at the date of its detachment from Turkey, and in the absent ° T ® nce shovy that Turkey agreed with Persia before that date t mo i y e frontier delimited in 191.4, or even denied its validity, it is tk ron ler lat must be held to be the one legally in force as between Persia an , UI \ eri T? r . e ’ Turkeys non-fulfilment of her obligations in respect of th ontier, even if instances of it occurred before Turkey lost the territon 8 soveieign y of Iraq would not in itself invalidate the frontier, and if ^ instances occurred after the loss of Iraq would be quite irrelevant to the questio: of a frontier that no longer concerned Turkey. Finally, the Protocol of 191and the subsequent delimitation was an agreement not only between Persia and Turkey, but between Great Britain and Russia as well, and the consent of all four powers would be necessary for its modification. 10. The Sub-committee of the Sixth Committee, which examined Iran’s application for membership of the League of Nations, decided inter alia that she possessed a stable Government and fixed frontiers, though they took note of the fact that the frontier between Iraq and Syria (no other frontier was mentioned) had not been fully agreed upon. Their report was adopted unanimously by the Assembly of the League on the 3rd October, 1932, when Iraq was formally admitted to membership of the League. 11. On this occasion, the Persian Delegate, who took part in the unanimous vote, made a speech of welcome, in the course of which he said :— ‘ c Persia has business to transact, agreements and conventions to conclude and frontier questions to settle with Iraq. We feel sure that these problems will be solved by direct negotiation and without any difficulty; but the fact that Iraq is now a Member of the League of Nations must tend to facilitate the rapid settlement of all such questions.” It does not appear that the Persian Government made any other declarations before the League of Nations on the subject. 12. Previously to this, however, the Persian Government had informed the Iraqi Government (in June 1932) that if the negotiations for the Conservancy Board which were expected to start shortly were postponed until after the entry of Iraq into the League, Persia would be debarred by Article 10 of the Covenant from raising the question of the frontier in the Shatt-el-Arab and near Khanaqin; they therefore proposed, by a communication to the Secretary-General, to reserve the right to deal with these questions after Iraq’s admittance. This attitude was in reality based on a misunderstanding of the effect of Article 10, but the Iraqi Government returned a soothing answer to the effect that the postponement of the negotiations in no way altered their desire to reach a satisfactory settle ment of these questions, and no more was heard of the matter. e 2 [10996]23 rj %4 Persia P*'-' hM I Date. 19.

This was a map begun by the British and Russian Commissioners, and continued by British and Russian surveyors in accordance with a proposal made by Lord Palmerston to the Russian Government in 1851. The map was finished in 1869 and com municated to the Turkish and Persian Governments concerned in 1869 and 1870 respectively. It consists of 14 sheets, on a scale of 1 : 73,050, upon which is marked a frontier-zone, varying from 20-25 miles in width, within the limits of which the Commissioners considered the boundary-line should be found. (The involved story of the compilation of this map is told by Sir E. Hertslet in a memorandum, dated the 10th January, 1873, printed and bound with other memoranda in Confidential 11812 (see Section 7 B, No. 7). (5) The map referred to in the “protocole relatif a la Delimitation Turco- Persane, &amp;c., 4th (17th) November, 1913,” which is described as bearing a part of the frontier-line in red. This map was that attached to the Declaration of the 29th July, 1913, by Sir Edward Grey and Hakky Pasha and signed by them. This map appears to have been in four sections. One section is on a scale of 1 : 250,000, the others on a scale of 1-inch = 2 miles. (These maps are reproduced in the printed volume of correspondence respecting the affairs of Persia for October- December 1913 : Part XXXVI, page 152.) (6) Ten photographic reproductions of the “Identic Map” which were prepared at St. Petersburg for the use of the Delimitation Commis sion of 1913-14. (See paragraph 2 (a) below.) 2. The maps which carry the “ trace final ” of the frontier as laid down by the Delimitation Commission appointed under the Constantinople Protocol of the 17th November, 1913, are given on p. 148 of the “ Recueil des Proces-Verbaux des Seances de la Commission, &amp;c.” (Confidenfinl 10714.) (See Section 7 A, No. 18. These maps are :— (a) The ten photographic copies of the “Identic Map.” The line was drawn in ink on all ten copies, and each of the fourteen sheets of every copy was signed by the four Commissioners. Three sets of these signed maps are in the possession of His Majesty’s Government (two in the Foreign Office and one at Tehran); the Russian Govern ment also received three, and the Turkish and Persian Governments two each (three photographic copies of this map are being made for the Iraqi Government and one of the original copies in the possession of the Foreign Office can be produced for inspection by the Council of the League). (5) The “Cartes Supplementaires ” and “ Detaillees ” preparedly the Commissioners on varying scales to cover those sectors of the nontiei for which the “ Identic Map ” proved to be inadequate. Where the signed “ Identic Map ” is not itself the final authority for t e frontier, it gives reference to the sheet of the Lai e Supplementaire ” on which the frontier is shown. (These maps ave been reproduced in fairly large numbers, and three sets have been given to the Iraqi Government, of which one will probably be given to the League Secretariat.) 3. In addition to these, the following maps may be mentioned . (a) The “ Reduced Identic Map,” a reduction of the original Identic Map, omitting some details, in nine sheets, on a scale o mi es it was prepared in 1873 and reprinted in 1912. * This map is also reproduced in Mr. Alwyn Parker s memorandum of the 2 P ' &gt; (see Section 8B, No. 15).(b) “ Colonel Ryder’s Map” (Colonel Ryder was the British surveyor attached to the staff of the British Commissioner m 1914), a copy 0 f the £C Reduced Identic Map ” upon which Colonel Ryder drew in % frontier-line as delimitated by the Commission, approximately, in ink (In order to illustrate their case, the Iraqi Government have asked for copies of this map, and will probably give a copy to the Secretariat of the League, but it has no juridical authority.) (c) A map known as the £&lt; Zelenoi-Kemball working map ” (1878), upon which the Turkish and Persian claims and a line suggested by the Mediating Commissioners were marked. This map is believed to have disappeared and the Russian Government, who were asked in 1912 if they had a copy, returned a negative answer. (d) A map (1 inch = 1 mile) prepared by Lieutenant (afterwards Sir Arnold) Wilson in 1909 to illustrate the difference between the Mediating Commissioners’ line and the status quo in the Shatt-el- Arab region (this is reproduced in Mr. Alwyn Parker’s memorandum of the 3rd April, 1912 : see Section 7 B, No. 15). (e) A chart illustrating the possible line of division between Persian and Iraqi territorial waters at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab; prepared in 1929 (E 5098/58/34 (1929)). 4. A list of maps of the frontier is also given on pages 75-79 of the Catalogue of Maps in the Foreign Office Collection, 1901-18 (Confidential 11028), and some further details in Foreign Office telegram No. 10, Saving, of the 28th November, 1934, to Bagdad (E 7011/197/34), of which the following is an extract:— ££ Position regarding Carte Identique is complicated. Original Carte Identique is on scale of 1 : 73,050, and in fourteen sheets. It was prepared at St. Petersburgh in 1867-69 from materials collected in 1849-53, and is, in fact, described as the ££ work of British and Russian officers in 1849-53,' the dates ££ 1867-69,” though quoted in Article II of Annex (A) to the 1913 Protocol, appearing nowhere upon the map itself. We have a single copy of this map in its original form. ££ Ten sets of photographic copies of this map were, however, made in 1912 and used by the 1914 Commission. The line of the frontier was drawn upon each copy in red ink and all fourteen sheets of each set were signed by the Commission. Three of these signed copies are in possession of His Majesty’s Government, one being in the Foreign Office, one at Tehran and one at His Majesty’s Embassy in Turkey (since brought to the Foreign Office). ” It should be noted that only nine out of the fourteen sheets are included in list on page 148 of Proceedings of 1914 Commission. This is because the line of the frontier on the last five (i.e., the northern) sheets is completely covered by the sheets of the Carte Supplementaire, so that reference to these sheets of the Carte Identique is not required. In the case of the first nine sheets, on the other hand, the Carte Identique is in nianj areas (notably Shatt-el-Arab) the only authority. In any case, last five sheets cover present Perso-Turkish frontier. £ It should also be noted, in order to avoid confusion, that while sheets of Carte Identique were originally numbered from north to south, 191 Commission renumbered them from south to north. It is to renumbeie sheets that list on page 148 of Proceedings refers. The reduced Carte Identique was originally prepared by Ordinance Survey in 1873 in nine sheets and on scale of 4 miles to the i 110 ! 1 ’ an reprinted in 1912. It does not reproduce all the details of the true Ur Identique and is not referred to in the Protocol or mentioned in the hs 0 maps on page 148 of the Proceedings of the Commission. In consequent, while it is good enough to be attached to letter to Secretary-Genera 0 purposes of illustration, it cannot be relied on in later proceedings.

There was much to he said for such a course more especially in the light of the statements made to the Council* The President (Tewfik Rttstil Aras), speaking as the repre sentative of Turkey, said that the statement made hy the Soviet representative in regard to the acts of the Imperial Russian Government applied equally to the position of the Turkish Government in regard to the acts of the Ottoman Empire. He had no objection to make to the suggestion put forward by me with which, in fact, he entirely agreed. As President of the Council he suggested that the Rapporteur should be given time to consider question and he asked parties to get into touch with Baron Alois!.

VII. 1.2 — RFPLY TO THE REQUEST OF THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT SUBMITTED TO THE COUNCIL OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS ,, November 29th, 1934, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq referred to the Council of the League of Nations a request which calls for the following observations: it aonears from the Boyal Government’s request that, according to its statement, the aaent! of the Imperial Government have violated the frontier of Iraq Actually, however, thev have always remained within the Imperial territory, while there have been numerous encroachments thereon by Iraqi agents and tribes, causing very considerable damage and ^“Vccordina tothe’Government of Iraq, the boundary was fixed by the Treaty of Erzernm of 1847 (Annex II) and by tbe Protocol signed at Constantinople on November 4th, 1913 (Annex IIP by the Grand Vizier and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Ottoman Empire and the Ambassador of Persia, on behalf of the two Parties, and by the Ambassadors of Great Britain and Russia, on behalf of their respective countries in the capacity of mediating Powers. In virtue of this Protocol, the delimitation was carried out on the ground in 1914 by a Commission composed of representatives of Persia, the Ottoman Empire, Great Britain, and Russia. 1 In the view of the Iraqi Government, this delimitation became final and unrevisable as and when each part of it was effected. The Persian Government, on the other hand, is of opinion that the Treaty of Erzernm of 1847, the Protocol of Constantinople of 1913, and consequently the delimitation effected by the Delimitation Commission of 1914, have no force, either in law or in equity, to determine the frontier. I. The Treaty of Erzerum of 1847 consists of nine articles. According to Article 2, in the Province of Zohab, Persia and the Porte respectively cede the lowlands and the highlands (Article 2, paragraph 1). Persia abandons all claim to the city and province of Suleimani (Article 2, paragraph 2), while “ the Ottoman Government formally recognises the unrestricted sovereignty of the Persian Government over the city and port of Muhammara, the island of Khizr , 2 the anchorage, and the land on the eastern bank — that is to say, the left bank — of the Shatt-al-Arab, which are in the possession of tribes recognised as belonging to Persia. Further, Persian vessels shall have the right to navigate freely without let or hindrance on the Shatt-al-Arab from the mouth of the same to the point of contact of the frontiers of the two Parties ” (Article 2 , paragraph 3). Negotiations, which were conducted under the pressing mediation of the two great Powers, had been lengthy and difficult, lasting four years. The two Contracting Parties were thus obliged to insert a provision to the effect “ that, when the texts of this Treaty have been exchanged, they will accept and sign the same, and that the ratifications thereof shall be exchanged within the space of two months, or earlier ” (Article 9 ). The Sublime Porte asked for an interpretation, which the Ambassadors gave (Annex IV) m an explanatory note (April 14th/26th, 1847), being the more ready to do so in that the Porte made it an absolute condition of its acceptance. “. . . on the understanding , wr°te the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Affairs in his reply to the Powers, “ that the Cowt of Fersia will accept the assurances which have been given by the representatives of the two me xating Courts to the effect that it will raise no claim going counter to those assurances, tt 1 further understanding that, in the event of any such claim being raised, the rea y wi e deemed to be null and void ” (Annex V). Persia, whose consent the Powers assumed without troubling to notify her, instructed her Ambassador in France, who was on trAQfvr nf °- proceed to Constantinople and exchange the ratifications of th e rfltifiPafi-nn me rr artlCleS l 'P 6 Powers requested him to include the explanatory note in his snnr»lPTYiGr.fQT.

Despite the efforts of the mediating Powers, the Treaty was followed only bv intermittent attempts at execution, not directed by the common will of the signatory States. Prom time to time a partial endeavour was made to delimit the frontier but without result. Persia did not accept the declaration made ultra vires by Mirza Mahommed Ali Khan on January 19th/3lst, 1848. The Porte refused to recognise the existence of the Treaty unless it embodied the substantial concessions contained in the explanatory note. Neither of the Parties held himself bound, as the Powers observed with a growing sense that the difficulties were so great as to render success highly improbable. The absence of agreement as to the explanatory note is referred to in the diplomatic correspondence , 1 in addition to the natural and, even more, the psychological obstacles as being the main source of all the difficulties. Witness the following passage : “ At the same time, it would be highly desirable that the mediating Courts should take the opportunity to clear up the species of discrepancy which is considered to exist between the terms of Article 2 of the Treaty of Erzerum and the explanations exchanged prior to the ratification of the Treaty between the Porte and the representatives of Great Britain and Russia at Constantinople. . . The insistence of each of the two Parties on his own interpretation is the main source of the disputes that are delaying the progress of joint work on the frontier.” That is an extract from the joint statement addressed by the British and Russian Commissioners to their Governments . 2 When Lord Palmerston read it, he wrote to the British Ambassador at St. Petersburg : “ The boundary between Turkey and Persia can never be finally settled except by an arbitrary decision on the part of Great Britain and Russia ”. 3 Difficulties continued. From time to time an “ arbitrary delimitation ” was made, but on each occasion it was immediately repudiated. Lord Palmerston found himself obliged to threaten either Party that might violate the frontier with the provision of “ aid and support ” to the other Party . 4 Thus the frontier, in establishing which neither State had secured the consent of the other, could not be fixed. Years passed, and the Powers became convinced of the rightness of the view expressed by the Commissioners of 1851 : “ We are absolutely certain that it is next to impossible to remove the obstacles which are obstructing the progress of demarcation, in the absence of more direct and decided intervention on the part of our respective Courts.” 5 Such intervention demanded the stimulus of personal interest. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Great Britain and Russia were engaged in dividing their spheres of influence in the Near East. It was necessary for them to define the limits of their respective spheres, and that involved prevailing upon Persia and the Ottoman Empire to fix the boundary between them. They accordingly persuaded those States to come to a direct agreement upon a new procedure. By their “ good offices ” they induced the Persian and Ottoman Governments, both of which were equally anxious to remove any possible future subject of controversy in regard to their common frontier, to instruct the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Turkish Ambassador at Teheran, respectively, to establish the bases of negotiation and the procedure to be followed in delimiting the frontier. Those representatives agreed (Protocol of Teheran of December 21st, 1911: Annex VII) on the formation of a commission consisting of an equal number of delegates of either Party, who should be furnished with all relevant documents and evidence, and should be required to establish the boundary Tine between the two countries ; after which a technical commission would be appointed for the sole purpose of applying on the spot the final delimitation on the lines laid down by the former commission. In its letter for the information of the Council with a view to the application of Article 11 , paragraph 2, of the Covenant, the Iraqi Government has. not thought fit to mention this Protocol. It is nevertheless of capital importance. Unlike the non-existent treaty of 1847, the Teheran Protocol of 1911 constitutes a formal and regular undertaking. It was the more readily concluded inasmuch as it relates to a procedure in two stages . first, the general tracing of a comprehensive line, and then the fixing of that line on the ground. The commissioners responsible for the first stage are enjoined to act m a spin of sincere impartiality on the basis of the clauses of the “ so-called Przerum Treaty conctudea in 1847 ” or, to be quite accurate, as only the year of the Hegira is mentioned, 111 • The agreement in nine articles dates from 1847 ; the explanatory note and its acceptance by the Porte also dates from 1847 ; the so-called ratification of Mirza Mahommed Ah Knan is dated 1848, Pera, Sefer 23rd, 1264. It follows that the treaty which, according to Article 3 of the Teheran Agreement, must serve as basis for the Joint Commission s ^ or ? described in Article 3 as “ the so-called Erzerum Treaty concluded in 1263”, only relates to the nine articles, leaving out of account the explanatory note. In spite of the express mention of the year 1263, which definitely confirmed the Persian point of view, tne roite energetically maintained its opposition. . ^ This uncompromising attitude had its effect on the work ot the Cons i I Commission (March 12th/25th-August 9 th/ 22 nd, 1912). But Russia, exercising piessure 1 Correspondence respecting the Demarcation of the Frontier between i uikey and Persia, piesei t both Houses of Parliament by command of Her Majesty, 1865. 2 Loc. tit., page 12. 3 Loc. tit., page 13. 4 Loc. tit., page 13*: Viscount Palmerston to Sir G. H. Seymour, October 11th, 1851, 5 Loc. tit., page 12.1 See Annex III. on Persia, induced her to abandon her point of view in practice while maintaining it™ principle. At the penultimate meeting (August 2nd/15th 1912) when the Porte w “ already preparing, in accordance with Aiticle o t e Teheran Protocol, to resort to arbitration at The Hague “ in order that the whole question (of the frontier) l finally settled ”, the Persian delegation, showing the most conciliatory spirit, made the following declaration: , t a. t, ^ * mi » An examination of the documents despatched from Teheran confirms the point of view consistently upheld by the Persian representative — namely, that Mirza Mahommed All Khan Envoy of His Imperial Majesty the Shah, did not possess full powers for the signature of additional stipulations which were not embodied in the authentic text of the Treaty as drafted by the commissioners of the two mediating ( ourts. While maintaining this observation of principle, the Persian delegation, actuated by a sincere desire to arrive at a settlement of the frontier question, and in view of the acts of mediation of Great Britain and Russia, exercised for the past seventy years, of the said Powers dated April 14th 126th, 1841 \ a nd recognises the explanations contained therein as forming an integral part of the Treaty of ErzerumA “ Declares its acceptance of the collective note.” On this date, August 2nd/15th, 1912, this acceptance was given for the first time; and after this concession Russia no longer permitted any evasions by the Porte. On August 9 th/ 22 nd, 1912, the Imperial Russian Embassy at Constantinople sent a note to the* Sublime Porte stating that “ the Imperial Government considers that too much emphasis cannot be laid on the necessity of putting into effect without delay tire explicit stipulations of the Treaty of Erzerum, which are tantamount to the restoration of the status quo of 1848 On the same day the Joint Commission concluded its proceedings. Independently of the stipulations of the bilateral agreement of Teheran, four-Power negotiations began which singularly overstepped the stipulations of the Protocol of December 21 st, 1911. It was no longer the Hague Court of Arbitration which, “in a spirit of sincere impartiality ”, was to deal with the difficulties ; it was direct negotiations by the mediating Powers, either among themselves or with both or even one of the other two nations, which were to settle the differences arbitrarily. Although, under the Protocol of 1911, negotiations were to take place at Constantinople, we thus find that, on July 21st, 1913, a “ Declaration ” was signed in London by Sir Edward Grey and His Highness Ibrahim Hakky Pasha concerning the southern frontier-line between Persia and Turkey . 1 This latter fact shows that the mediating Powers, being anxious each to delimit its own sphere of influence to its own advantage, tended increasingly to act independently of the mediation procedure. Being bound, like their respective clients, Persia and the Ottoman Empire, by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, Great Britain and Russia, after rejecting the arbitral settlement provided for in the Teheran Agreement, replaced it by a mediation procedure which by no means deserves such a name, for it answered neither to the spirit nor to the rules of The Hague. Going beyond the provisions of the Erzerum Treaty of 1847 and even of the Erzerum Treaty of 1848, the agreement entitled Protocol of Delimitation, which was signed on November 4th/17th, 1913, at Constantinople by the representatives, not only of Persia and the Porte, but of Great Britain and Russia, reveals that, after having been direct parties to the negotiations, the two great Powers remain direct parties to the conclusion, and in this way arrange for a detailed delimitation without other purpose than to satisfy Russia’s interests to the north even at the expense of Turkey, and Great Britain’s interests to the south even at the expense of Persia. It would therefore be incorrect to represent the Protocol of November 4th/17th, 1913, in spite of its modest name of “ Delimitation ”, as a simple technical application of an alleged agreement, the unaccepted text of Erzerum. In actual fact, the Protocol of November 4th/17th, 1913, with which the proceedings of the Constantinople Joint Commission terminated, gave birth, on the pretext of applying the valueless text of Erzerum, to a veritable political agreement of a wider scope ana showing a more marked interventionist tendency, thus covering a greater territorial area. Between the very vague line of .1848 and the very definite one of 1913 there is a greater difference than that between the principle and its application. Substantial advantages are granted which do not appear in 1847 or even in 1848. ,, In particular, Persia is for the first time stopped on the Sbatt-al-Arab by extraordinary and anachronistic fixing of the frontier on the bank of that riT er ' Here the 1913 text manifestly goes beyond that of 1847. When Article 2 of the ire j of Erzerum says that “ the city and port, the island of Khizr (Abadan) and the lana the eastern bank — that is to say, the left bank — of the Shatt-al-Arab, winch are in possession of tribes recognised as belonging to Persia, shall remain in the mres ' m sovereignty of the Persian Government ”, it certainly does not signify acceptance o . bank as the boundary, this boundary placing in 1913 the whole of the river un e sovereignty of the riparian of the right bank. While the Treaty is silent cn^tins p t international law undoubtedly places the boundary in the middle of the rix el &gt; 01 ^ of the channel. Besides the text which assigns the ports and inland waterways eastern bank to Persia “ in unrestricted sovereignty ” like the land on that a text which gives the right to navigate “ freely without let or hindrance as ®? n Middle each of the riparian States wall have an equal right of sovereignty as far as e of the river.The 1913 text also fixes, in certain sections of the land frontier, a line which is in no way in keeping with the natural and geographical character of the territory. Without here going into details which would unduly complicate the present statement, it will be sufficient to say that the new line is very different from that of the “ status quo of 1848 In any case, both on the river and on land, the 1913 line effects a considerable shifting of the territorial position. According to the Constitutional Laws of Persia, however (Articles 22 and 24 of the Constitution of August 5th, 1906, and Article 3 of the Supplement to the Constitutional Laws of October 7th, 1907 : Annex VIII), no change or rectification of the boundaries of the State can take place without the legislative approval of the Mejliss, and, indeed, the frontiers of the State can only be modified in virtue of a law, following the example of the Belgian and French Constitutions. But the Constantinople Protocol was not approved by the Mejliss ; hence the condition essential for its validity, not only under municipal law, but, on the basis of municipal law, under international law, is lacking. The same condition was required at that date by the Ottoman Empire (Annex IX). It was not fulfilled, which suggests that, whatever the Iraqi Government may say, the Ottoman Government did not regard the frontier-line fixed by the 1913 Protocol, and, on the basis of that Protocol, by the Delimitation Commission of 1914, as valid and final. td lit! cluMb toflfei IS ||! Mtiw reeiiti for ft f® roiiifi'J refill t ritainilfe math atft# ](191 ie p ’ 11 if ‘P7 A III. In virtue of the 1913 Protocol, and hence on an entirely invalid basis, a Commission consisting of representatives of Persia, the Ottoman Empire, Great Britain and Eussia proceeded to a delimitation of the frontier on the ground. It began its work in the south at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab in the Persian Gulf, and thence proceeded northwards. In the southern and central portion of the frontier, the delimitation was effected to the advantage of the Ottoman Empire, and its representatives of course made no objection. In the northern part, the Ottoman Commissioners refused to take part in the delimitation of the frontier in a certain area ; they even refused to evacuate and hand over to Persia numerous localities which, according to the 1914 line, had to be detached from the Ottoman Empire. Moreover, during the Commission’s work and immediately afterwards, Ottoman troops occupied or even reoccupied certain areas which had been assigned to Persia by the 1913 Protocol (Annex X). Thus the Ottoman Empire in practice treated as non-existent the Protocol of 1913 and the 1914 line, which, indeed, were legally null and void. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the 1913 Protocol’s claim (Articles 4 and 5) to render compulsory and final that part of the frontier regarding which a sovereign award had been given by the British and Bussian Commissioners, it is one of the highest principles of equity and logic, which the Parties cannot disregard in virtue of any valid convention (and still less in virtue of an invalid one), that the tracing of a frontier-line forms a single and essentially indivisible operation. If the Protocol which fixes the frontier is disregarded, owing to the failure of one of the Contracting,Parties to observe it, in respect of a certain part of the line, it must also be disregarded in respect of other parts. _ &gt; Hence it must be concluded that the 1913 Protocol and the 1914 delimitation relied on by the Iraqi Government must be deliberately rejected. They must be rejected, ( 1 ) because they take as starting-point a treaty which was itself non-existent at the when the Teheran Agreement of 1911 referred to it ; (2) because, in concluding the 1913 Protocol, which already gravely departs from the provisions and stipulations of the Teheran Agreement of 1911 providing for arbitration in case of disagreement, rules of the mediation procedure, the main features of which had just been fixed at The Hague in agreements signed by all the Parties, were openly disregarded ; (3) because, on the pre ex - of a treaty between Persia and the Ottoman Empire, an agreement was in reality concluae between Great Britain and Eussia, accompanied on the Shatt-al-Arab by a direct agreemen concluded in London between Great Britain and the Sublime Porte and by t e impropei conclusion of a bilateral understanding in the British capital in the middle of nego la ions which were to take place at Constantinople between all the Parties ; ( 4 ) because, as y, one of the Parties, the Ottoman Empire, immediately failed to carry out, m a giea m y respects, the Act of 1913 fixing the frontier — a failure which, even if partial, mvoiveu me total lapse of the Act owing to its indivisible character. To all the causes of nullity deduced from general contract law must iastly be added tlie decisive reason that the case in question concerned a public law contract su by constitutional law, here forming part of international law, to conditions o and international validity which were not fulfilled either by Persia oi &gt;y Empire. IV. The same argument, which leads the Imperial Government to regard as null and void the delimitation of the frontier in 1914, was adopted by the new Turkish Re P , latter declared officially that the “ Protocol of 1913 cannot be regarded as a valid political instrument, since it has not been given the form indispensable for its * 1 y a ri Tf an say, it was neither approved by the Ottoman Chamber of Deputies noi ra i m y the Chief of the Executive, ait the time. This Protocol has according y iwithout effect. ” In view of this conclusion, Persia and Turkey consequently enters * negotiations with the object of determining their frontier. The latter did not he ° definitive until the Convention of 1932 was approved by the respective Leffislah^; two Contracting States (Annex XI). s azures of the A like procedure might have settled the question in regard to Iraq when in 1922 State was formed of a part, adjacent to Persia, of the former Ottoman Empire BeoeahiU both at the time of Iraq’s recognition as a State and before, at the time of and afteh’ admission to the League of Nations, the Imperial Government reminded Iraq that it did f recognise the validity of the titles on which the Royal Government thought it could i for the alignment of the frontier. In expressing the friendly sentiments with whichh welcomed the entry of Iraq into the League of Nations, His Highness Foroughi Minister f Foreign Affairs, first delegate of Persia to the Assembly, added to his congratulations W precise remark : “ Persia has business to transact, agreements and conventions to conehiif and frontier questions to settle with Iraq ”. It may be noted in particular that Iraq’s claim to ownership in and sovereignty over the whole of the Shatt-al-Arab is not only devoid of any conventional foundation, but is even in absolute contradiction with them odera principles recalled, and so far as necessary affirmed, under the auspices of the League of Nations, at Barcelona in 1921, even before the birth of Iraq : principles in virtue of which when a river flow^s between two countries, it is the median line or rather the thalweg that shall, in order the better to ensure its freedom, be taken by them as the frontier. Without investigating whether in modern law- a contrary convention is permitted, as was formerly taught, it is sufficient to note that, in the opinion of all, when a treaty is silent on the subject the boundary on the bank, the “ dynamic limit ”, which is unequal and a matter of ambition and conquest, must yield before the median boundary, the “ static limit ” in conformity with the river’s function of equalisation, unification and pacification. It is not reasonable that a State should have the ownership over a long bank of a river and should, at the same time, be deprived of sovereignty over that river. That would be contrary ’to the most elementary care for the security of the riparian State, It is inadmissible that, by a strange contradiction, warships of the riparian State, authorised to navigate a river “ freely without let or hindrance ”, should be obliged, on the side of their national bank, to take orders, even orders confined to navigation, from the delegate on the other bank of a foreign sovereign. When considerations of this kind were, during the United Kingdom’s mandate, brought to the knowledge of the mandatory Power which was responsible for the international representation of the mandated country, the British Minister at Teheran duly expressed himself in agreement with the desire of Persia to settle her situation on the Shatt-al-Arab, in order that there might be no doubt on that subject. He wrote as follows on March 11th, 1929 : 1 have now received instructions to give Your Highness a categorical assurance that, if your Government is now prepared to recognise Iraq, my Government, having learnt in detail from the Persian Government of the practical difficulties that arise from the present state of affairs in the Shatt-al-Arab and the guarantees that it desires, will lend its good offices with the Iraqi Government in order to assist Persia in obtaining her reasonable demands.’ He even showed himself prepared to conclude a convention relating to the Shatt-al-Arab. ” Finally ”, he states in conclusion, “ in order to find a means of meeting the legitimate complaints of Persia, my Government is inclined towards the idea of a tripartite treaty between Persia, Iraq and the United Kingdom. This treaty might provide for the setting up of a special administrative council, on which Persia would be represented, in order to supervise shipping in the river or to take other measures acceptable to the Parties concerned. But the details would have to be discussed later.” No further action was taken on the conversations, as the draft submitted by the British Minister did not contain any reference expressly recognising Persia’s sovereignty over the half of the river on the side of the Persian bank. V. Fiom the foregoing statement, it would seem that the non-validity of the documents on which the Royal Government bases its claims is sufficiently manifest to constitute an a ec l u jUe icply to the allegations put forward in paragraphs 1 and 3 of its letter and to have prov ed completely that the charges brought against the agents of the Imperial Government ns regards the alleged violation of the boundary-line are entirely without foundation. , , T . 0 / 1 a( B Government complains, in paragraph 4 of its letter, that it has been unable o obtain any result by means of direct negotiation : it adds that the numerous conciliatory pi oposa s w hich it has made, whether for the investigation bv joint commissions of particular pi oh ems affected by the precise alignment of the boundary, or for the general examination o all causes of inconvenience to either side arising from tbat alignment, with a view to eliminating the inconveniences by appropriate administrative arrangements have been e . n , p 1 (k .j e(1 ted or ignored. The Imperial Government thus feels compelled topoin ia le ^ e various proposals could not be taken into consideration : for, based as T exceptl °n on the 1914 line, they were inacceptable - a fact that has been ^ ron y demonstrated by the foregoing considerations. ^ Tm -nul Sh0 ^ kj . the re Ply addressed by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to « 8 r A taires at Tehe ran on December 17th, 1934 (Annex XII), the Impem P _ uas aever failed to give proof of its friendly intentions towards the . delimitation of • hj this ' spirit ’ has ahvays expressed the desire ttat ami omVif v It N 011 tiers may be carried out in accordance with the principles o J ' p ? 1 1 conformity with the rules of international law, in order effectively tolaeatp mi iii (is the friendly relations that are necessary for the sincere collaboration of two neiahbourino' States, both Members of the League of Nations. The Imperial Government has, moreover’ carried on long negotiations on these bases with the authorities of the Eoyal Government’ The reason that it has been unable to achieve any result is that the Iraqi authorities have always insisted on maintaining their point of view as to the validity of Iraq’s titles — titles based on obsolete documents which are out of date, relating to a period when the Persian and Ottoman Empires were under the aggressive influence of foreign Powers and, moreover contrary to the requirements of the present time ; titles devoid of all kind of legal force and entirely without equitable foundation. The Eoyal Government nevertheless persisted in maintaining its point of view, without appearing to realise that great changes have occurred in the world and more particularly that two of the Powers which had participated in the framing of those documents — Tsarist Eussia and the Ottoman Empire — have ceased to exist, and, lastly, that the said documents have been rejected, not only by the Persian Government, but also by the Turkish Eepublic. It is regrettable that the Iraqi Government, instead of doing its utmost to settle the question directly with the Persian Government, in accordance with the principles of justice and equity, in application of the rules of international law and in conformity with the principles and spirit of the League of Nations, should have felt it incumbent upon it to apply to the Council and to present its claims in the form of a complaint. Although the Imperial Government is sincerely desirous of settling this question by direct negotiation with the Eoyal Government, it cannot refuse to agree to its being submitted for consideration to the Council, whose spirit of impartiality and justice is an adequate guarantee that the arguments here submitted will be duly examined. 1 IjHL _ i Hi 1LIST OF ANNEXES.

Out of the large number of letters and notes which the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Persian Minister at Baghdad have addressed to the Iraqi Minister at Teheran and to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, we confine ourselves for the moment to quoting in extenso the few notes given below, while reserving our right to produce others later. [Translation of Note, dated 9/Y/1311 (July 31st, 1932), No. 16187, from the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the Boyal Iraqi Legation.] Note. With reference to its previous notes concerning repeated acts of aggression by Iraqi brigands on Persian territory, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to communicate the following information to the Eoyal Iraqi Legation : On tir 29th of this year, a certain number of brigands entered Persia by boat from Hour and went towards Sabeleh in Persian territory. Their first intention was to seize the money collected by the tax collector, but, as the gendarmes of the Finance Department opened fire on them and thus prevented them from doing so, the brigands went to the residence of Ahmad, the mayor of the place, and stole a number of different objects. The inhabitants pursued the brigands as far as the river bank and seized one of their boats. The thieves nevertheless managed to get back to Hour after wounding three inhabitants of Sabeleh and killing one of them. An exhaustive enquiry has proved that these brigands are subjects of the Royal Government, belonging to the Abu-Mahomed tribe, that they inhabit the northern part of Farneh and have made Hour a centre — upon which they can also retire — for their attacks on Persian territory. In bringing the above-mentioned facts to the knowledge of the Royal Iraqi Legation, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs accordingly requests it to be good enough to make urgent and effective representations with a view to the arrest and punishment of the culprits, the payment of the compensation due to the victims and the restitution of the stolen objects. It would also be glad to be kept informed of the result of these representations. [Translation of Note of 13/Y/1311 (August 4th, 1932), No. 16878, from the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to the Royal Iraqi Legation.] Note. In continuation of its Note No. 11402 concerning repeated acts of aggression by armed brigands on Persian territory, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to inform the Royal Iraqi Legation that, according to a report which has reached the competent authorities, the brigands in question, on the night of Khordad 23rd, at midnight, again attacked the place situated at 2 farsakhs’ distance from Khafajieh, killing two persons, wounding six others and carrying off fifty camels. The gendarmerie forces pursued the brigands and got back the stolen camels, but the brigands managed to escape into Iraqi territory. The enquiry has proved that the above-mentioned brigands belonged to the Hamidan tribe and were led by Vamek, a Persian rebel who had taken refuge in Iraq. The Ministry for Foreign Af fairs therefore desires once again to draw the Royal Legation’s attention to the importance of the problem involved in attacks by Iraqi and Persian armed brigands and the murders and plunderings carried out on Persian territory, and requests it to be good enough to make urgent representations with a view to the arrest of the Persian subject Yamek and his surrender to the Persian frontier authorities, the punishment of his Iraqi accomplices and the payment of the compensation due to e heirs of the victims. The Ministry also requests the Legation to be good enough to inform it at the earliest possible moment of the result of such representations. * * * [Translation of Note No. 5162 from the Persian Minister at Bagdad to the Prime Minister of Iraq.] ^ t 1oq o Bahman 17th 1311 — February 6 th, 1933. Very urgent. In continuation of my long conversation of yesterday with J our ® xcel i, eI 1 r c J la ^^ m reply to letter No. 839 of Shabat 5 th, 1933, I have the honour to inform Your E^oellen y that the result of the Iraqui Government’s negligence in regard to frontier questions! V 10 (particularly in the Sulaimaniyeh region) is now becoming apparent. The representab which I have made on several occasions, drawing the Royal Government’s attentimf this situation and to the necessity for urgent action with a view to the expulsion of n? partisans of Djafar Sultan and the notables of Lohun, and my request that measures shnniJ be taken to check the activities of these brigands and to prevent the sale of arms a ! ammunition to the inhabitants of the Persian frontier regions, have been unavailing th Iraqi authorities having made no serious efforts to give us satisfaction. The telegraphic despatches which I have received from my Government report incursions into Persian territory by bands of Iraqis from Hani-Garmaleh and south of Nosud, carrying with them a large quantity of arms. These malefactors distribute monev and arms to the inhabitants, thus encouraging them to rebel and to join with the bandits in committing crimes. The Imperial Government cannot believe that the Iraqi authorities are ignorant of the banding together of such a large number of their compatriots, their association with fugitive Persian bandits, their accumulation of arms and money, and their preparations for subversive activities on such a large scale. It deeply regrets to note that the Royal Government has taken no notice of the legitimate requests made by the Persian Legation at Baghdad, asking that greater attention be paid to frontier questions — viz., despatch of regular troops, the cessation of foreign intrigues and agitation, arrest of fomenters of disturbances and their surrender to the Persian Government or banishment to places remote from the frontier. As a result of this off-handedness, a quite intolerable situation has been created, which is prejudicial to the friendly relations existing between the two neighbouring countries. On behalf of my Government, I wish to enter an emphatic protest against these incidents. In accordance with the formal assurance given to me yesterday by Your Excellency that you would take a personal interest in the settlement of these questions, and in view of your promise to send troops and to put other measures in hand, I would request you, for the moment, to give urgent instructions as follows : ( 1 ) A high and trustworthy official to be sent to the province of Sulaimaniyeh to carry out an impartial and careful enquiry into the conduct and actions of the local police. All those who have been guilty of negligence in the performance of their duties or have assisted and supported the malefactors should at once be recalled and punished. (2) Within the shortest possible time, a military force of sufficient strength and consisting of men who do not come from the place in question (this detachment to be additional to the troops who, you have informed me in writing, will be despatched shortly), to be sent to the spot, with definite instructions to cut off without delay the relations between the bandits at present on Persian territory and those residing on this fi.e., the Iraqi) side of the frontier who supply them with arms and money. All the Iraqi inhabitants guilty of creating these disturbances and all those guilty of incitement to revolt to be arrested, removed from the frontier zone and duly punished. The Iraqi forces to be ordered further to arrest without hesitation and hand over to the Persian military authorities fugitive brigands attempting to cross the frontier. (3) The few partisans of Djafar Sultan and the notables of Lohun, wdio are at present at Sulaimaniyeh and whose names and places of residence will be communicated to the Iraqi authorities by the Persian Vice-Consul in that city, to be expelled at once from the province and sent to a place at a great distance from the frontier. As I am not yet in possession of full particulars of the incident, I reserve the right later to submit the Imperial Government’s requests to the Iraqi Government. In conclusion, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that, as requested in Note No. 839, I have asked my Government to be good enough to give instructions to the Persian military commander to get into touch with his Iraqi colleague with a view to direct collaboration for the suppression of the brigands on the frontier. I shall be glad to be informed of the result of the urgent measures taken by the Iraqi Government. , * * * [Translation of Letter No. 1892, dated Thmah 20th, 1312 (July 11th, 1933), from the Persian Minister at Baghdad to the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs ad interim of Iraq.] In continuation of previous correspondence relating to the fact that brigands from in who have taken refuge in Iraqi territory have established themselves m ta neighbourhood of the Persian frontier, where, in complicity with the armed brigands haq, they cross the frontier and commit massacres and depredations in Persian ternto ., 6 1 0 n f ur G* make to Your Highness the following communication: , ,, , i 1] t ou ^ \ t ie R; o y al Iraqi Government has on several occasions been mvitea, verbally and m writing, to take energetic action to prevent the establishment of the saw11 brigands in the frontier regions, and to prevent any complicity, material or moral, between them and the armed brigands o; Iraq, so as to preclude any renewal of their incursions • nr* nf m qo cj onvoct on/J rJ ^ • i Lii V'AAA P &lt; 1 • J ^ ’ ccx ^* UXiVyJ-X x±xv lIX lOlUlln into Persian territory or of the massacres and depredations which they commit in the villages of the district of Ovraman, it is nevertheless a regrettable fact that the Royal Iraqi Government has not taken any steps to comply with the legitimate demands of the Imperial Persian Government, and has, indeed, taken up an incredibly cool attitude towards those demands, thereby enabling the brigands in question to repeat their offences. According to information supplied by the competent authorities, it is proved that : qlii ( 1 ) Three soldiers from the frontier post, having proceeded, in order to draw water, to a well situate in Persian territory in the neighbourhood of the Iraqi frontier, were suddenlv . fired upon by brigands armed with rifles and concealed in gardens in Iraqi territory. As a : , result of the attack, a soldier named Reza Khan was killed, the brigands taking flight when relief arrived on the spot. Two Iraqi police agents, named Abdurrahman and Firuz, who arrived on the scene to enquire into the matter, themselves confirmed the existence in the region of several bands of brigands. ( 2 ) Colonel Ahmed Khan Zavieh, the newly appointed commander of the military idUiy forces in Kurdistan, when on his way from Raneh to Kovsud, was suddenly attacked by the said brigands, who fired on him from an ambuscade in his rear and killed him. In bringing the above facts to your knowledge, I am instructed totie ptiij ( 1 ) To convey to you my Government’s vigorous protests on the subject of the above- mentioned events, and to press for the adoption of urgent measures for the arrest of the brigands in question ; to ask for such as are of Persian nationality to be handed over to the police of the Imperial Government ; to claim reparation for the damage done and the provision of pensions for the heirs of the victims, and, finally, to ask that my Government be informed of what has been done. owe {ili iceofili iiiipt of sieiitss ifitt iWeffi resilpi lilt# icitaeititf* elrapfuiio 39H ilk eijielW® jijj W-*' act Wj tolled ( 2 ) To draw T your attention to my Government’s view that these events, taken as a whole, show clearly that, through the complaisance and laxity of the competent agents of the Royal Iraqi Government, these brigands have developed such a degree of boldness and effrontery as to make the lives and property of the Persian inhabitants of the frontier districts in the future the playthings and trophies of these murderous bandits. Their audacity has reached a point at which they do not hesitabe to assassinate high officers and soldiers, and, after committing every kind of crime, to take refuge in Iraqi territory. Unquestionably, if these brigand bands w T ere not in Iraqi territory, the agents of my Government would not fail to remedy this state of affairs. As, however, they are in Iraqi territory, the Iraqi Government must be aware that responsibility in the matter rests with itself ; and the Persian Government is accordingly entitled, in the interest of neighbourly relations, to expect the Royal Iraqi Government to collaborate with the Imperial Persian Government and to put an end to the existing state of affairs. In any case, my Government is no longer prepared to tolerate the repetition of thes 6 regrettable incidents, and cannot in the future accept the far from plausible pretexts of the agents of the Iraqi Government and thus become a mere witness of such occurrences. Accordingly, for the last time, in order to end the matter once and for all, I beg you to take such steps as you consider desirable and necessary to remedy the existing state of affairs and root out the brigands, and to communicate to me, so as to enable me to convey the information to the competent authorities of my Government, the result of such tma. decisions as the Iraqi Government may take to terminate these regrettable occurrences , otherwise, the Imperial Persian Government will be compelled to take energetic action m the matter and even to refer it to the League of Nations. , , In that case, the entire responsibility will rest with the Royal Iraqi Governmen , and it will no longer be entitled to complain of the procedure so chosen. 6 fion®.

They began by recapitulating the progress, up to date, of the negotiations recently instituted among them. The Joint Commission provided for in Article 1 of the Protocol signed at Teheran between the Imperial Ottoman Embassy and the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs with a view to determining the bases for the negotiations relating to the delimitation of the Turco-Persian boundary held eighteen meetings, the first on March 12 th (25th) and the last on August 9th ( 22 nd), 1912. On August 9th (22nd), 1912, the Imperial Russian Embassy at Constantinople addressed to the Sublime Porte, under No. 264, a note stating that the Imperial Government considers that too much emphasis cannot be laid on the necessity of putting into effect without delay the explicit stipulations of the Treaty of Erzerum, which are tantamount to the restoration of the status quo of 1848 ”. The Imperial Embassy at the same time forwarded to the Imperial Ottoman Government a memorandum showing in detail the frontier-line in conformity with t e stipulations of the treaties in force. . . , , , The Imperial Ottoman Government replied to this communication by a note date March 18th (31st), 1913, No. 30469/47. It stated that “ the Sublime Porte, being anxious to comply with the desire expressed by the Imperial Russian Government by eliminating any cause of difference in its cordial relations with the latter, and wishing, tur er, o demonstrate to the Persian Government its entire good faith in regard to the ispu e existing on the subject between the two countries, has decided to accept the line mentioned in the aforesaid note and memorandum of the Ambassador of His Majesty the mpe of Russia for the delimitation of the northern part of the Turco-Persian fron ler Serdar Bulak to Bane — that is to say, down to the 36th parallel of latitude •_ Nevertheless, the Imperial Ottoman Government suggested a numbei o m0 * . in the line proposed in the memorandum annexed to the note of the Impel la Embassy dated August 9 th ( 22 nd), 1912, No. 264. on The Imperial Ottoman Government also appended to its note an ®xp an y the situation of the Zohab boundaries and the arrangement that it would e a ® in order to reach a final and equitable understanding with the Persian ove that part of the frontier ”.— 14 The Imperial Russian Embassy replied by a note dated March 28th (Auril inm 1013, No. 78.

This exchange of notes was followed by conversations between Their Excellencies M de Giers and Sir Gerard Lowther, of the one part, and His Late Highness Mahmud Shefket Pasha, of the other part. The result of these conversations was recorded in an aide-memoire presented by His Excellency the Russian Ambassador to His Highness the Grand Vizier on June 6 th, 1913, and in the note from the Sublime Porte addressed on June 26tli (July 9th), 1913, No. 34553/95, to the Russian Embassy, and on July 12th, 1913 to the British Embassy. On July 29th, 1913, a “ declaration ” was signed in London by Sir Edward Grey and his Highness Ibrahim Hakky Pasha concerning the demarcation of the southern boundary between Persia and Turkey. The Imperial Russian Embassy then proceeded to recapitulate the principles of delimitation established in the correspondence concerning the Turco-Persian boundary. It addressed to the Sublime Porte a note dated August 5th (18th), 1913, No. 166. An identic note wa,s addressed to the Sublime Porte by the British Embassy on the same date. The Sublime Porte replied to these communications by identic notes dated September 23rd, 1913, No. 37063/113. As a result of the subsequent negotiations, the four plenipotentiaries of Great Britain, Persia, Russia, and Turkey, agreed on the following provisions : I. It is agreed that the boundary between Persia and Turkey shall be defined as follows: The boundary in the north shall start from boundary-mark No. XXXVII on the Turco-Russian frontier, situate close to Serdar Bulak, on the crest between Little and Great Ararat. It shall then drop southwards by way of the ridges, leaving on the Persian side the valley of Hambat, Sarnvteh, and the water system of Yarym-Kaya, which rises to the south of Mount Ayubeg. The boundary shall then leave Bulak-bashi, in Persia, and shall continue to follow' the highest ridge, the southern extremity of which is situate at about 44° 22 longitude and 39° 28' latitude. Then, skirting the w r est side of the marsh which extends to the west of Yarym-Kaya, the boundary shall cross the Sary-Su stream, pass between the villages of Girde-baran (Turkish) and Bazyrgan (Persian), and, ascending tf. ^ the w r est of Bazyrgan, follow' the watershed formed by the Saranli, Zenduli, Gn-Kehme, Kanly-baba, Geduki-Khasineh, and Ueveji ridges. After Heyeji, the line shall cross the valley of Egri-chai at the place to be designated yv t he Delimitation Commission in conformity with the status quo, leaving the villages of Nado and Nifto in Persia. The ow nership of the village of Kyzyl-Kaya (Bellasor) shall be established after an examination of the geographical situation of the village, the western side of the watershed m that region being allocated to Turkey, and the eastern side to Persia. fell ou Id the final boundary line leave outside Ottoman territory a section of the road v- c 1 Passes close to Kyzyl-Kaya and connects the district of Bayazid with the province °„ 2 ljl ’ ^ ] ;’ 3 understood that the Persian Government shall give free passage over this section of the road to the Imperial Ottoman Posts and to travellers and goods, other than military troops and convoys. The fiontier shall then ascend to the ridges forming the watershed : Kyzyl-Ziaret, •Ir!!i^ 7C ^ U / m an } U ’ K ara *kurga, the hill between the reservoirs of Ayry-chai (Persian) and of Jelli-gol (Turkish), Avdal-dashi, Reshkan, the hill between Akhurek and Tavra Bevra-begzadan, Gevri-Mahine, Khydyr-baba, A^ristan. , , nf q. ^ r ®^ ds 1 F 0 1 t 1 u i’’ the Protocol of July 15th (28th), 1880, known as the Protocol ^ Sh n! be a PP lied in such a way that the village of Kevlik shall remain i y ’ and the J i ages of Blle j ik , Razi, Gharatil (Haratil), the two Jelliks, and Panamei , shall remain m Persia. i *“ ier follo ™S the Mir-Omar ridge shall ascend the mountain of Suraja, ^ ^ ny ? wv 11 the Tlirkisl1 side &gt; shall pass by way of the watershed formed by the f B rUS i ] ' Kbu ^ n ’. the mountain of Haravil, Beleko, Shinetal, Sardul, m B T rg t bend ’ Iska nder, Avene, and Kotul. The valley of Bajirgas tVom fh - U A key ’ aJ ! d t}ie vllla §'os of Sartyk and Sero in Persia, and the frontier shall pas ! p , '‘ e southern extremity of Kotur over the ridge rising to the west of the Per f^, r of Behik, and, following the peaks of Seri-Baydost, shall join the crest of Mount Zont.From Mount Zont the frontier shall follow continuously the watershed between the Persian districts of Tergever, Desht, and Mergever, and the Turkish sanjak of Hakkiari — that is to say, the crests of Shiyeh-Shishali, Chil-Chovri, Chel-Berdir, Kuna-Koter, Kazi-beg, Avukh, Mai-Helaneh, the mountains to the west of Binar and Delamper ; then, leaving on the Persian side the basin emptying by way of Ushnu into the lake of Urumiya, including the sources of the Gadyr river known as Abi-seri-gadyr (the valley of which is situate to the south of Delamper and to the east of Mount Girdeh), it shall reach the pass of Keleh-Shin. To the south of Keleh-Shin the frontier shall leave on the Persian side the reservoir of Lavene, including the valley of Chumi-Geli (situate to the east of Zerdegel and to the south-west of Spi-rez), and on the Turkish side the waters of Revnaduz, and shall pass by the following peaks and passes : Siah-Kuh, Zerdeh-Gel, Boz, Barzin, Ser-shiva, Kevi- Khoja-Ibrahim. Thence the frontier shall continue to follow towards the south the main chain of Kandil, leaving on the Persian side the basins of the affluents of Kialu on the right side : the streams Purdanan Khydyrava and Talkhatan. It is understood that the Turkish tribes which are in the habit of spending the summer in the said valleys at the Gadyr and Lavene springs shall still have the use of their pastures under the same conditions as in the past. Having reached the summit of Seri-Kele-Kelin, the line shall pass over Zinvi-Jasusan and the pass of Bamin, and shall cross the Vezne river near the Purde-Berdan bridge. The Delimitation Commission will have to decide as to the future of the village of Shenieh, on the basis of the general principle of the status quo. After Purde-Berdan, the frontier shall ascend over the chains of Foka-baba-kyr, Berde-spian, Berde-Abul-Fath and the pass of Kaniresh. It shall then follow the watershed formed by Lagav-Ghird, Donleri, the pass of Khan-Ahmed, and the southern extremity of Tepe-Salos. The frontier will thus pass between the villages of Kandol (Turkish) and Kesh-keshiva and Mazynava (Persian), and reach the course of the Kialu river (the Little Zab). After joining the course of the Kialu river, the frontier shall follow it upstream, leaving on the Persian side the right bank (the Alani-ajem) and on the Turkish side the left bank of that river. On reaching the mouth of the Khileh-resh river (an affluent of the Kialu on the left side), the frontier shall follow the course of that river upstream, leaving on the Persian side the villages of Alot, Kivero, etc., and on the Turkish side the district of Alani- Mavont.

P Icn “ e The points on which the Sublime Porte requires explanations are as follows • 1. The Sublime Porte presumes that the clause of Article 2 of the draft Treaty (wl the city, port, and anchorage of Muhammara, and the island of Khizr, to Persia ca 6 ^ include either the territory of the Sublime Porte comprised 1 outside the city or the t?° ports of the Sublime Porte situate in these parts. 0Uler The Sublime Porte is also concerned to know whether, under the terms of another nart of the same article relating to tribes which, while actually belonging to Persia may ham) to be divided, one half being settled in Ottoman territory and the other half in Persia! territory, it follows that those parts of the tribes which are in Turkey will also become subject to Persia, and the territory in their possession will accordingly also be ceded to Persia ; and whether Persia will ever be entitled at some future date to dispute with the Porte the right to the possession of such territory. 2. The Sublime Porte is concerned to know whether, under the existing terms of Articles 1 and 4, the Persian Government is entitled to include the pecuniary compensations as between the two Governments which it had entirely renounced, in the category of individual claims. The Porte understands these claims to apply solely to certain pasturage dues and to losses incurred by the respective subjects of the two Governments as a result of the activities of brigands and the like. The Sublime Porte further asks whether the Persian Government’s assent will be obtained on the question of fortifications added to Article 2, as also in respect of the passages regarding reciprocity which were omitted in Article 7 of the Commissioners’ draft/ The undersigned Eepresentatives, being anxious and bound to dispel the uncertainties ol the Sublime Porte on all the above questions, hereby declare as follows: The anchorage of Muhammara is the part situate opposite the city of Muhammara in the Haffar Canal, and this definition is not susceptible of any other interpretation. .The undersigned Representatives are further in agreement 'with the Ottoman Minister in the view that, in ceding to Persia in the region in question the city, port and anchorage of Muhammara and the island of Khizr, the Sublime Porte is not ceding an ^ tA 161 ^ erri tp r y P r any other ports there may be in this region. ^ The undersigned Representatives further declare that Persia will not be entitled on any pretext whatsoever to put forward claims in regard to the regions situate on T e ri £at bank of the Shatt-al-Arab, or to the territory on the left bank belonging to urkey, even where Persian tribes or parts of such tribes are established on the said bank or in the said territory. , ,, „ ^ 1 ^aras tne Sublime Porte’s apprehension ^ — - i ia &lt; i T&gt; ea v m0e irre S u larly interpreted in such a way as to give rise to the revn iy . ie eisian Government of the pecuniary claims as between the two Governmen ine undersigned Representatives hereby declare that, inasmuch as it is explicit yTa a e m Articles 1 and 4 of the draft Treaty that all claims of this kind fre p 80111 ce are, and are to continue to be, waived, there can be no resumpti m if Oi8 °a 8810 ns on the matter in any case, and that only the claims of individw / 1 e&lt; ^ satisfaction by the two Parties respectively ; and, further, that t • , ° 1011 validity of such individual claims will be subject, as agreed, to S ™ m 1 m ?

I am in receipt of Your Excellencies’ collective official note of April 14th (26th) last in reply to my official note to Your Excellencies asking for certain explanations on the subject of the Persian Treaty. Your Excellencies’ note states in regard to the territories and tribes to which Article 2 of the draft Treaty relates that, although the Sublime Porte agrees in this article to the retention by Persia of the city and port of Muhammara, the anchorage opposite the city in the Haffar Canal and the island of Khizr, the Sublime Porte does not thereby cede any other port or territory in this region ; and, further, that the Persian Government will not be entitled to put forward any claim to proprietary rights either in respect of the regions situate on the right bank of the Shatt-al-Arab or in respect of the regions belonging to the Sublime Porte on the left bank, even where a Persian tribe or part of such tribe is established in such regions ; further, that the claims as between the two Governments which are Avaived in their totality by both Governments under Article 1 will not be included in the category of individual claims to which Article 4 relates ; and, further, that you have good grounds for hoping that the Court of Persia will readily agree to the insertion of the clause embodying the principle of reciprocity which was omitted in Article 7. The Sublime Porte is satisfied with the above official explanations and assurances ; and His Majesty the Sultan, having complete confidence in the two Mediating Courts and in their Representatives, has ordered in the exercise of His Sovereign Will that instructions should be issued to His Excellency Enver Effendi, Plenipotentiary of the Sublime Porte at Erzerum, to sign the draft Treaty submitted by the Commissioners of the two Mediating Courts without amendment, on the understanding that the Court of Persia will accept the assurances which have been given by the Representatives of the two Mediating Courts to the effect that it will raise no claim going counter to those assurances, and on the further understanding that, in the event of any such claim being raised, the Treaty will be deemed to be null and void. . . , It is for the jmrpose of bringing all the above considerations to Your Excellencies notice that this official note has been drawn up and is communicated to you.

Extract from the Minutes of the Delimitation Commission of 1914. 8 evenly-sixth Meeting. The Ottoman Commissioner stated that he had received instructions from his Government to discontinue the delimitation. The other Commissioners, not having received any similar communication, said that they would refer to their respective Governments in order to report the facts and request instructions. In the meantime, it was decided to complete the maps as far as Mir Omar Dagh. Seventy-seventh Meeting. The Ottoman Commissioner said that he had received fresh instructions from his Government to inform the Commission that various considerations compelled the Ottoman Government to defer toa later date the delimitation of the section of the frontier situated between Mir Omar Dagh and Mount Hidir Baba. He said that the status quo would remain in force for that section, and the demarcation would be continued northwards. The Commissioner also pointed out that, as Article XIII of the Protocol entitled the Commission to postpone the delimitation of a part of the frontier, no derogation from the provisions of that instrument was involved. The Persian Commissioner said he had already referred this matter to his Government, and he was of opinion that the frontier of that district should be marked on the map, the evacuation of the places which would fall to Persia being postponed to a later date. The Ottoman Commissioner declined this proposal. After discussion, the Commission noted the Ottoman declaration, but asked the Ottoman Commissioner whether he would submit to a majority vote, in accordance with Article XIII of the Commission’s Eules of Procedure, drawn up and signed by the representatives of the four States. The Ottoman Commissioner said that he could not submit to a majority vote. The Eussian Commissioner then pointed out that, in order not to lose time, and in view of climatic conditions, the demarcation should be continued. But, at the same he said, it should be noted that the Ottoman Commissioner’s refusal was contrary to the Eules of Procedure, and the fact should be notified to the respective Governments. After further discussion, the Commissioners accepted the view of the Eussian Commissioner, and decided to resume the delimitation as from Hidir Baba. Seventy-eighth Meeting. fact The Persian Commissioner reported that he had notified his Ottoman col eague o t that he had been informed that Ottoman soldiers had again encampei a i er Sartyk. The Ottoman Commissioner said he had immediately telegrap e Constantinople, and had just received a reply to the effect that, if sue i an oc ^ u had taken place, orders' would be given for the withdrawal of those soidiers Commissioner thanked his Ottoman colleague for this reply, which, he said, &lt; e the goodwill of the Ottoman Government.Eighty-fourth Meeting. The remarks of the Ottoman Assistant Commissioner in the previous Minutes ree-a h 1 the delimitation of the Kotur gave rise to discussion. gar&lt;llI1 § The Russian Commissioner objected to the passage to the effect that the delimit f I of that district was “ outside the powers of the Commission ”, since the Final Prot i mentioned the exact demarcation of the Kotur boundary. 10001 The three Commissioners had already protested against the delay which had occur in the delimitation of that district as a result of the Ottoman Government’s refusal was contrary to Article XIII of the Rules of Procedure. ’ 100 The instructions received by the Russian Commissioner from his Ambassador Constantinople led him to think that it had been agreed to continue the delimitation 10 the sole condition that the villages of Kotur would not be evacuated for the moment T the Turkish detachments. There had been no mention of Kotur’s remaining undehmited^ The British Commissioner also thought that the statements of the Mediating Commissioners were not ultra vires. The Persian Commissioner requested that Djewzer, which was at present occupied by an Ottoman detachment, should be evacuated. p The Ottoman Assistant Commissioner said that, in view of the mobilisation he personally had no power to cause the districts which would fall to Persia as a result of the delimitation to be evacuated. He promised to make representations with a view to their evacuation. The Commissioners noted this promise. As a result of the reservations made by the Ottoman Assistant Commissioner, it was decided to sign the detailed Map of Kotur with the note “ approved without the frontier’s being marked ”. A Sub-Commission was appointed to arrange for the erection of boundary-marks at the places mentioned in the instructions delivered to it. Eighty-sixth Meeting. The Ottoman Assistant Commissioner stated that he had received instructions to postpone the evacuation of Bulak-Bashi on account of the mobilisation. Eighty-seventh Meeting. The Persian Commissioner then made the following statement : ' When the Ottoman Commissioner, relying on Article 13 of the Constantinople ro ocol, requested that the delimitation of Kotur be postponed, I informed him that e grounds on which he based his request were not in accordance with the spirit of the ro ocol, since that document referred to a 1 majority vote whereas on this occasion— 23 — m ” fy, li ^ChMIji 11 % Of ^MtoPoiij,, The Ottoman Assistant Commissioner said that the onmtinn ™ his province on acconnt of the mobilisation, but he had written to h?rr WaS 0,lt8ide requesting that Djoowzer be evacuated ; as regarded Bulak-Bashi he had he?n informed that that jdace would remain occupied until the end of the mobilisation 1 With regard to Kotur, he was ignorant of his Governments nnim ^ lllsatl0 J- it needless to delay the completion of the Commission’s work on account oTtha^ tho ! l . ght The Eussian Commissioner stated that he had receikd akwram PrA a- a ! uest T- at Constantinople to the effect that His Highness S^fv^rh^i^ ^proposal to delimit Kotur on the new map, and had promised to give the Sssary ’ The British Commissioner proposed that the Ottoman Commissioner should make a statement to the effect that, if lie received the necessary instructions, he would recoSe the frontier to be the hue marked on the map annexed to the statement of the British and Russian representatives dated October lst/14th. The Ottoman Commissioner said he had not received permission even to discuss the Kotur question. The Chairman proposed to regard that day’s meeting as the final one, and to attach to the Minutes a description of the entire frontier except Kotur, but to hold a further meeting at Bazyrgan on October 28th in order to settle the question of Kotur He begged the Ottoman Commissioner to telegraph immediatelv to his Government in order to obtain a reply before October 28th. The Ottoman Commissioner accepted the proposal, but said it would be difficult for him to wait longer. The next meeting was fixed for October 28th, at 2 p.m., at Bazyrgan.

In accordance with instructions received from His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq, I have the honour to enclose a copy of the letter which he has addressed to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations on the subject of the Perso-Iraqi frontier, together with the annexes thereto. The letter is written in English, one of the two official languages of the League. I am also instructed by my Government to inform Your Excellency that, although the letter in question is worded as a complaint against the Persian Government, it is by no means the expression of any unfriendly sentiments. On the contrary, the essential aim of Iraq’s foreign policy, towards which my Government’s efforts have always been directed, is sincerity towards Persia. The Iraqi Government believes that the causes of the misunderstanding that has subsisted between our two countries for some years are to be found in a difference of opinion as to the correctness of the frontier delimitation made in 1914 — a final delimitation — and considers that the time is now opportune for the settlement of the dispute in question. I would conclude by informing Your Excellency that, once this difficulty has been overcome, the Iraqi Government looks forward to a new era of sincere friendship and co-operation between the two Governments and nations.

TRANSLATION OF FRENCH TRANSLATION OF LETTER No. 40874, DATEI DECEMBER 17th, 1934, FROM THE PERIAN MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO THE IRAQI CHARGE D’AFFAIRES. 1 t0 acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 1209 of December 9 th, 1934 , and th( 0 J I 1 * * * . 6 letter addressed by His Excellency Nouri Said Pasha, Minister for Foreig Affairs of the Royal Government of Iraq, to the Secretary-General of the League of Rations 1 must thank you for intimating that the letter addressed to the League is not tn ; uuitt unt} leucer aaaressea to tne juea-gu^ ^ — . expression of any unfriendly sentiment, and that sincerity towards Persia is the essenti aim of Iraq s foreign policy ; and I have the honour to inform you that my Governmen mfV 8 ky 110 . other sentiments. It has always been anxious to overcome a i icu y that might arise between it and the neighbouring country, and its effortsalways been directed towards that end, because it regards neighbourly relations between the two countries as necessary and indispensable, and considers that the true interests of Persia demand the prosperity of Iraq. None the less, the Imperial Government deeply regrets to observe that the Royal Government of Iraq persists in casting doubt upon Persia’s legitimate rights in connection with the frontier-line between the two countries, and regards the acts of the Persian authorities, which do not exceed the limits of the rights of their country and the principles and rules of international law, as being of an aggressive nature. This circumstance is due to a misconception on the part of the Iraqi Government as to the legal validity of the documents which, in its view, should provide the basis for the determination of the frontier between the two countries — those documents being, for reasons that have frequently been brought to the notice of the competent Iraqi authorities, devoid of any legal force. Similar difficulties also existed in regard to the frontier between Persia and Turkey, and the two Governments had no other recourse than to proceed to a fresh delimitation of their frontier-line, and to secure the sanction of their competent legal authorities for the agreement on that subject, in order that it might become binding upon both Parties. It is beyond question that the era of sincerity and loyal co-operation between our two Governments and nations, to which you allude in your letter, cannot be inaugurated until the frontier-line between our two countries, which is one of the essential questions, is fixed upon a basis of right, justice and the principles of international law. The Imperial Government has always desired the establishment of such a basis in the question of the frontiers between the two countries, and, had the Iraqi Government taken the least step in that direction, it would have been most frankly and sincerely welcomed by the Persian Government. Apart from the negotiations that have taken place in the past on this subject between the authorities of the two States, I had certain conversations just lately, when I went to Geneva to attend the last session of the League Assembly, with His Excellency Nouri Said Pasha, and made every possible effort to find a solution of the problem. On my return from Geneva, I had some more lengthy conversations with the authorities of the Iraqi Government, in the hope of arriving at a satisfactory result. To my great regret, however, I was unable to achieve my object. Even now, should the Iraqi authorities be desirous of entering upon direct negotiations on the basis defined above, the Persian Government will have pleasure in complying with that desire. If they prefer the question to be submitted to the Council of the League, the Imperial Government will likewise acquiesce, since it places the utmost confidence in the impartiality and fairness of the Council, and has every hope that its legitimate arguments will be recognised and confirmed by that authority.

Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs read Persian reply as meaning that Kazerni is anxious to reach agreement if possible without a reference to Council of League of Nations* They are inclined gimilsrily to construe Kasemi’s personal attendance at Geneva. Nuri Pasha has informed me in confidence however that some weeks ago Persian Minister admitted openly to Director- General of Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Persian activi^ ties in Shatt~el~Arab and elsewhere on frontier were only part of Shah’s plan to oust British altogether Irorn Persian Guilt He alluded to Persian claims to islands and their proposed control of lights and buoys as further evidence of Shah’s main design but added that this will be frudraced so long as British interests at Basra ana Shatt-el-Ar&amp;b remain what they now are* He intimated that if Persia' secured half Shaft el Arab she would be willing to enter at once into a ’navigation agreement pr ov i ded the Briti sh_.— In reply Director-General pointed out that suggested solution was impossible so long as Iraq, was bound by Tt y of 1931 and that she had no intention of abandoning that instrument.2 . After proposing as zation of Shaft-el-Arab an alternative the internationali- (whieli was negatived by Director- General) Persian Minister threatened that Shah might be driven to establish Na.val oase at Mohammerah. Director- General pointed out that the only reply to this would be establishment of Xra.Qi base at Pa.o and a. rase in armaments. I am informed priva.tely by Nuri that Turks and probably Russians will side with Persia at Geneva. Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs has intimated to Muzahim that while he will uphold validity of Treaty of Erzeroum he will deny legality of the Protocol of 1913. He justi fies this attitude on the ground that throughout recent negotiations with Persia for revision of Turco-Persian frontier Turkish Government took the line that 1913 Protocol wa.s invalid and must abide by this contention. The advantage to Russia of any weakening of our position in the Gulf is obviouse Nuri Pasha also informs me that in recent conversation with Iraqi Minister at Angora Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to Persia a.s an Nuri left Bagdad yesterday and is due at Angora December 29th. He proposes to leave Angora for Rome December 31st (the day of Kazemi’s arrival) after discussing the case with Ismet. ., These conversations seem to me to emphasize community of British and Iraqi interests on the question of Shatt- el-Arab.

Previous papers :■ A long minute on this question will be found at P.Z.6702/34. From the papers now submitted it will be seen that the Iraqis have referred their dispute with Persia to the League of Nations. H.M. Ambassador at Bagdad has been authorised to infonn the Iraqi Government that the U.K. delegation j at Geneva will give them all such proper support and assistance as lies in their power. The Tehran telegrams at P.Z. 7765/34, Mr. Rendel’s account of his interview at the Foreign Office with the Persian Minister at P.Z. 7782/34, and the Foreign Office telegram to Tehran at P.Z. 7788/34 give the Persian reactions to the K Iraq Government *s action. It is amusing to find Persia 'counting , reading. 2730 1000 4.34 They malce interesting tin; on/ 9)on the friendly support of H.M. G. M (Tehran telegram Ho. 186 at P.Z. 7765) but Mr. Rendel held out no hopes in this respect. The Persians appear to be rather nervous and upset at the Iraqi move. With regard to the Foreign Office fears about the position in the Shatt under present arrangements and their suggestion that Iraq might offer the ’♦thalweg' frontier to Persia in return for acceptance of the Conservancy Board Convention, please see the Admiralty and Board of Trade letters at P.Z.6914/34 and 7017/34. On the evidenceavailabl e at present the Foreign Office fears seem to have been rather exaggerated and pessimistic, and the Board of Trade think that the physical dangers to the Shatt waterway envisaged by the Foreign Office are too hypothetical for a new policy to be based on them. A note by the Foreign Office Legal Advisers on the legal position in the Shatt in time of war in regard to the passage of warships, transport of stores and war material etc. is flagged. It seems to show that ’ tlie status quo as at present is much better than the position would be under the Foreign Office proposals, unless it were possible compatibly with Persia’s neutrality in time of war, to induce Persia to agree to a specific provision for the free passage of warships in time of war, as in time of peace, in return for the thalweg frontier.

His Highness expressed the opinion that in so far as Practiced issue was concerned the letter constituted an ad mission that there was something to be said for Persian case, i could nac contest this but remarked that at present juridi cal point was the only one involved.

Addressed to Tehran. Repeated to Bagdad No. 255.[Communicated to the Council and the Members of the League.] ffr( REQUEST BY THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT under Article 11, Paragraph 2, of the Covenant. Note by the Secretary-General : The Secretary-General has the honour to circulate to the Council and the Members if the League a communication from the Iraqi Government, dated November 29th, 1934. Baghdad, November 29th, 1934. I have the honour to inform you that for some time past, and particularly during the last two years, great anxiety has been caused to the Royal Iraqi Government by persistent iisregard and violation of the Iraqi-Persian boundary by official agents of the Imperial Persian Government. 2. The boundary between Iraq and Persia is derived from the Treaty of Erzerum of 1847 (Appendix I), and a Protocol signed at Constantinople on November 4th, 1913, by the Grand Vizier and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Ottoman Empire and the Ambassador of Persia, on behalf of the two parties, and by the Ambassadors of Great Britain and Russia, on behalf of their respective countries in the capacity of mediating Powers. Section V of this Protocol specifically laid down that, as soon as any part of the frontier had been delimited by the Delimitation Commission to be set up in accordance with Section II, that part should be held to have been finally fixed and should not be open either to subsequent examination or to revision. The delimitation of the frontier on the ground provided for in Section II was carried out by this Commission in the year 1914. A print containing the Protocol of 1913 and the proceedings of the Commission of 1914 is attached as Appendix II. 3. In spite of the legal position as outlined above, the Imperial Persian Government has consistently disregarded and violated the boundary so established. A summary of some of the more flagrant acts of aggression, with copies of the relevant correspondence, is attached (Appendix III). As will be seen from this correspondence, the Imperial Persian Government attempts to justify its conduct on the ground that it does not recognise the validity of the boundary and does not consider itself bound by the arrangements by which it was determined. This view the Royal Iraqi Government is unable to accept. 4. The Royal Iraqi Government has hitherto been loth to formulate publicly a complaint against a neighbour and fellow-Member of the League of Nations. It has left nothing undone in its endeavour to settle the matters at issue direct with the Imperial Persian Government. As will be seen from the correspondence, the numerous conciliatory proposals which it has made, whether for the investigation by joint commissions of particular problems affected by the precise alignment of the boundary, or for the general examination of all causes of inconvenience to either side arising from that alignment, with a view to eliminating the inconveniences by appropriate administrative arrangements, have been consistently rejected or ignored. 5. The continuance of the state of affairs described in the preceding paragraphs cannot fail to disturb the good understanding between Iraq and Persia which Iraq so earnestly desires. With great regret, therefore, the Royal Iraqi Government sees no alternative but to bring the circumstances to the attention of the Council under Article 11, paragraph 2, of the Covenant. 6. I have the honour, accordingly, to request that you will be so good as to cause this matter to be placed on the agenda for consideration by the Council at its next session. 7. A copy of this letter with the appendices is being communicated simultaneously to the Imperial Persian Government. , rv . 7 . ^ (Signed) Nouey Said, Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Article 2. The Persian Government undertakes to cede to the Ottoman Government all the lowlands that is to say, the land in the western part of the province of Zohab ; and the Ottoman Government undertakes to cede to the Persian Government the eastern — that is to say, all the mountainous — part of the said province, including the Kirind Valley. The Persian Government abandons all claim to the city and province of Suleimani, and formally undertakes not to interfere with or infringe the sovereign rights of the Ottoman Government over the said province. The Ottoman Government formally recognises the unrestricted sovereignty of the 1 ersian Gov ernment over the city and port of Muhammara, the island of Khizr, the qu an( ^ ^. e ^ anc ^ an the eastern bank — that is to say, the left bank —of the fenatt-al-Arab, which are in the possession of tribes recognised as belonging to Persia, urtner, Persian vessels shall have the right to navigate freely without let or hindrance ^ ia, tt-al-Arab from the mouth of the same to the point of contact of the frontiers of the two Parties.

The two High Contracting Powers further undertake that all the other refugees shall be handed over in conformity with the earlier Treaty of Erzerum. Article 6. Persian merchants shall pay the Customs dues on their goods, in kind or in cash, according to the current present value of such goods, in the manner specified in the article relating to trade in the Treaty of Erzerum concluded in 1238. 1 No additional charge whatsoever shall be levied over and above the amounts fixed in the said Treaty. Article 7. The Ottoman Government undertakes to accord the requisite privileges to enable Persian pilgrims, in accordance with the former treaties, to visit the Holy Places in the Ottoman dominions in complete safety and without vexatious treatment of any kind. Further, the Ottoman Government, being desirous of strengthening and consolidating the bonds of friendship and concord which should subsist between the two Mussulman Powers and between their respective subjects, undertakes to adopt such measures as may be most appropriate to ensure the participation, not only of Persian pilgrims, but of all other Persian subjects, in all the said privileges in the Ottoman dominions, in such manner as to protect them from any sort of injustice, molestation, or incivility, whether in respect of their commercial activities or in any other respect. Furthermore, the Ottoman Government undertakes to recognise Consuls to be 31si N appointed by the Persian Government in places in the Ottoman dominions where their presence may be required on account of commercial interests, or for the protection of Persian merchants and other Persian subjects, save only in Mecca the Eevered and Medina the Resplendent, and to respect in the case of the said Consuls all the privileges due in virtue of their official character and accorded to Consuls of other friendly Powers. The Persian Government, for its part, undertakes to accord reciprocity of treatment in every respect to Consuls to be appointed by the Ottoman Government in places in Persia in which the latter may consider the appointment of Consuls to be necessary, as also to (listingpecii Ottoman merchants and other Ottoman subjects visiting Persia, ent ski fti i v iates. Article 8. The two High Contracting Musulman Powers undertake to adopt and enforce the measures necessary to prevent and punish theft and brigandage on the part of the tribes and peoples settled on the frontier, to which end they will quarter troops in suitable localities.

The Sublime Porte presumes that the clause of Article 2 of the draft Treaty cedi the city, port, and anchorage of Muhammara, and the island of Khizr, to Persia cann? include either the territory of the Sublime Porte comprised 1 outside the city or the oh 0 ports of the Sublime Porte situate in these parts. The Sublime Porte is also concerned to know whether, under the terms of another part of the same article relating to tribes which, while actually belonging to Persia, may happen to be divided, one half being settled in Ottoman territory and the other half in Persian territory, it follows that those parts of the tribes which are in Turkey will also become subject to Persia, and the territory in their possession will accordingly also be ceded to Persia ; and whether Persia will ever be entitled at some future date to dispute with the Porte the right to the possession of such territory. 2. The Sublime Porte is concerned to know whether, under the existing terms of Articles 1 and 4, the Persian Government is entitled to include the pecuniary compensations as between the two Governments which it had entirely renounced, in the category of individual claims. The Porte understands these claims to apply solely to certain pasturage dues and to losses incurred by the respective subjects of the two Governments as a result of the activities of brigands and the like. The Sublime Porte further asks whether the Persian Government’s assent will be obtained on the question of fortifications added to Article 2, as also in respect of the passages regarding reciprocity which were omitted in Article 7 of the Commissioners’ draft. The undersigned Eepresentatives, being anxious and bound to dispel the uncertainties of the Sublime Porte on all the above questions, hereby declare as follows : Ad 1. The anchorage of Muhammara is the part situate opposite the city of Muhammara in the Haffar Canal, and this definition is not susceptible of any other interpretation. The undersigned Eepresentatives are further in agreement with the Ottoman Ministry in the view that, in ceding to Persia in the region in question the city, port and anchorage of Muhammara and the island of Khizr, the Sublime Porte is not ceding any other territory or any other ports there may be in this region. The undersigned Eepresentatives further declare that Persia will not be entitled on any pretext whatsoever to put forward claims in regard to the regions situate on the right bank of the Shatt-al-Arab, or to the territory on the left bank belonging to Turkey, even where Persian tribes or parts of such tribes are established on the said bank or in the said territory. Ad 2. As regards the Sublime Porte’s apprehension that Articles 1 and 4 of the draft Treaty may be irregularly interpreted in such a way as to give rise to the revival by the Persian Government of the pecuniary claims as between the two Governments, the undersigned Eepresentatives hereby declare that, inasmuch as it is explicitly stipulated in Articles 1 and 4 of the draft Treaty that all claims of this kind from wdiatever source are, and are to continue to be, waived, there can be no resumption °-ii if discussions on the matter in any case, and that only the claims of individuals will be entitled to satisfaction by the two Parties respectively ; and, further, that the examination and validity of such individual claims will be subject, as agreed, to a special commission to be appointed ad hoc and that the decision as to what claims are o de regarded as individual claims will also have to be referred to this commission. &gt;Ar t0 tiie two sll ^ sl diary questions raised at the conclusion of His Excelk ofo? . fi 1 f fi, n( ^ e ’ un dersigned Eepresentatives believe that they are justifies , P er sian Government will readily agree to the insertion in Article 7 of uses wi regard to reciprocity of treatment to be observed by both Government iff al mt ^ eS L of their respective subjects, pilgrims and Consular Agents.

Michel de Giers, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Bi s Majesty the Emperor of Russia to His Majesty the Sultan ; His Highness Prince Said Halim Pasha, Grand Vizier and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Ottoman Empire have met for the purpose of recording in the present Protocol the Agreement concluded between their respective Governments with regard to the Turco-Persian boundary. They began by recapitulating the progress, up to date, of the negotiations recently instituted among them. The Joint Commission provided for in Article 1 of the Protocol signed at Teheran between the Imperial Ottoman Embassy and the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs with a view to determining the bases for the negotiations relating to the delimitation of the Turco-Persian boundary held eighteen meetings, the first on March 12th (25th) and the last on August 9th (22nd), 1912. On August 9th (22nd), 1912, the Imperial Russian Embassy at Constantinople addressed to the Sublime Porte, under No. 264, a note stating that “ the Imperial Government considers that too much emphasis cannot be laid on the necessity of putting into effect without delay the explicit stipulations of the Treaty of Erzerum, which are tantamount to the restoration of the status quo of 1848 ”. The Imperial Embassy at the same time forwarded to the Imperial Ottoman Government a memorandum showing in detail the frontier-line in conformity with the stipulations of the treaties in force. The Imperial Ottoman Government replied to this communication by a note dated March 18th (31st), 1913, No. 30469/47. It stated that “ the Sublime Porte, being anxious to comply with the desire expressed by the Imperial Russian Government by eliminating any cause of difference in its cordial relations with the latter, and wishing, further, to demonstrate to the Persian Government its entire good faith in regard to the dispute existing on the subject between the two countries, has decided to accept the line mentioned in the aforesaid note and memorandum of the Ambassador of His Majesty the Emperor of Russia for the delimitation of the northern part of the Turco-Persian frontier from Serdar Bulak to Bane — that is to say, down to the 36th parallel of latitude ”. Nevertheless, the Imperial Ottoman Government suggested a number of modifications in the line proposed in the memorandum annexed to the note of the Imperial Eussian Embassy dated August 9th (22nd), 1912, No. 264. The Imperial Ottoman Government also appended to its note “an explanatory note on the situation of the Zohab boundaries and the arrangement that it would be able to accept in order to reach a final and equitable understanding with the Persian Government on that part of the frontier i The Imperial Russian Embassy replied by a note dated March 28th (April lOth), 1913, No. 78. It noted the statement “ by which the Imperial Ottoman Government recognises as a principle for the delimitation of the Ararat-Bane section the exact sense of Article 3 of the Treaty of 1848, known as the Treaty of Erzerum, as set forth in *(«(«► th( !#' P w AtflUews i.gif, fonly-ba jtato C liloinP digol (fur bmk Kotu note of August 9th (22nd), 1912, No. 264 ”. As regards the modifications proposed by tk Sublime Porte, the Imperial Embassy stated (with a reservation on the question Egri-chai) that it could not sufficiently emphasise the necessity of making no change in the line established in its note of August 9th (22nd), 1912. As regards the question of Zohab, the Imperial Russian Embassy, while reserving the right to submit its detailed observations concerning that frontier, expressed// its opinio on the whole of the Ottoman draft, which does not seem to it to guarantee sufficiently; the future, the maintenance of order and peace on the frontiers PP z &lt; 'istcte j On April 20th (May 3rd), 1913, the Russian and British Embassies addresse ^ -- — — - ■ ’ - - ’ --emoranaum identic note to His Highness Prince Said Halim Pasha, accompanied by a mei summarising their point of view regarding the delimitation of Zohab and the regi situate south of that district. This exchange of notes was followed by conversations between Their Excellencies - Giers and Sir Gerard Lowther, of the one part, and His Late Highness Mahmud Pasha, of the other part. The result of these conversations was recorded in am. . presented by His Excellency the Russian Ambassador to His Highness the Gran ^ on June 6th, 1913, and in the note from the Sublime Porte addressed &lt;m ^ (July 9th), 1913, No. 34553/95, to the Russian Embassy, and on July 12th, 19 &gt; British Embassy. d i • 29th, 1913, a “ declaration ” was signed in London by Sir Edward Giey his Highness Ibrahim Hakky Pasha concerning the demarcation of the southern between Persia and Turkey. wsitiemexi - lie yr. ul WiTepe-Salos. The frontier will thus pass between the villages of Kandol (Turkish! Kesh-keshiva and Mazynava (Persian), and reach the course of the Kialu river (the Littl Zab). . After joining the course of the Kialu river, the frontier shall follow it upstream W' on the Persian side the right bank (the Alani-ajem) and on the Turkish side the left w of that river. On reaching the mouth of the Khileh-resh river (an affluent of the Ki!i on the left side), the frontier shall follow the course of that river upstream, leaving on h Persian side the villages of Alot, Kivero, etc., and on the Turkish side the district of Mavont. At the south-western extremity of Mount Balu, the frontier shall leave the con? of the Khileh-resh river, and, ascending over the north-west extremity of the Surkew chain extending to the south of the Khileh-resh river, shall pass over the Surkew ridge, leaving th districts of Siwel and Shive-Kel on the Turkish side. On reaching the astronomical point of Surkew almost at latitude 35° 49', the frontier shall pass in the direction of the village of Champar-aw, the future of which shall be decided by the Delimitation Commission on the basis of the accepted principle of the status quo The line shall then ascend over the chain of mountains which form the frontier between the Persian district of Baneh and the Turkish district of Kyzyieja ; Galash, Berdi-Kechel Pusht-Hangajal, Du-bera, Parajal, and Spi-Kana, after which it shall reach the pass of Kow-Khuvan. Thence, still following the watershed, the frontier shall turn southwards and then westwards, passing by way of the summits of Vul-Guza, Pushti-Shehidan, Bazar- Mai, Bali-Keder, Keleh-Melaik, and Kuhi-Koce-resha, separating the Turkish district of I Teretul from the Persian district of Merivan. Prom there, the frontier shall follow the course of the Khalil-Abad brook downstream as far as its confluence with the Chami-Kyzylja, and then this last-named river upstream as far as the mouth of its left affluent flowing from the village of Bnava-Suta fit shall follow this Bnava-Suta brook upstream and, by way of the passes of Keli-fNaveh-Sar and Keli-Piran, shall reach the pass of Surene, known, it appears, by the name of Chigan (or Chakan). The main chain of Avroman, extending in the direction north-west-south-east, shall then form the frontier between Persia and the Ottoman district of Shehrisor. On reaching the peak of Kemadjar (south-east of Kala-Selm and north-west of Sheri-Avroman), the frontier shall continue to follow the main ridge as far as its ramification on the western side, rising to the north of the valley of Dere-Yuli, leaving the villages of Khan-Germela and Kowsud on the Persian side. For the remainder of the frontier as far as Sirvan, the Commission shall — by way of exception — delimit the ground, taking into consideration such changes as may have occurred there between the year 1848 and the year 1905. South of Sirvan, the frontier shall begin close to the mouth of the Chami-Zimkan, shall pass by way of the Beyzel (Bezel) mountain, and shall descend to the Chemi-Zerishk watercourse. Kext, following the watershed between this last-named watercourse and the river which, rising in the Bend-Bemo, bears, according to the identic map, the name of Pushti-Sherav (Arkhevendu), it shall ascend to the summit of Bend-Bemo. After following the ridge of Bamu (Bemo), the frontier, on reaching the defile of Derbendi-Dehul (Derbendi-Hur), shall follow the course of the Zengeneh (Abbasan) river as far as the point nearest to the summit of Shevaldir (astronomical point) and situate below the village of Mamyshan. It shall ascend this summit and shall next pass by way of the crests of the hills forming a watershed between the plains of Tileku and Serkaleh, then by way of the chains of Khuli-Baghan, Jebel-Ali-Beg, Bender-Chok-Chermik, Sengler, and Asengueran, as far as the point in the Tengi-Hammam defile situate opposite the northern extremity of the Karawiz mountains. Thence the frontier shall follow the course of the river Kuretu as far as the village of that name.

A. THE SHATT-AL-ARAB. The Protocol of 1913 contains a clear and unambiguous description of the boundarv on the Shatt-al-Arab : y “De ce point (i.e., from the mouth of the Nazaile canal) la frontiere suit lecoins du Chatt-el-Arab jusqu’a la mer en laissant sous la souverainet4 ottomane le fleuve et toutes les lies qui s’y trouvent. ” There are two exceptions : the ownership by Persia of certain named islands, and the continuance of the modern port and anchorage of Muhammara under Persian jurisdiction, . A detailed description of the boundary-line is embodied in the proceedings of the second sitting of the Delimitation Commission and reproduced in the Tableau Descriptij de k Ligne-Frontiere annexed to the proceedings : the line is described as following low-water level of the left bank of the Shatt-al-Arab, departing from it only to the extent necessary to leave in Persia the named islands referred to above and the anchorage of Muhammara, The Directorate of the Port of Basra derives its authority from the Inland Waters Shipping Proclamation, 1919, and the Port of Basra Proclamation, 1919, issued by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief the British Forces in Iraq. Under Article 114 of the Constitutional Law of Iraq these proclamations have the validity of Iraqi Law. On November 9th, 1932, two sloops and four gunboats recently acquired for the Persian Navy entered the Shatt-al-Arab and proceeded up-stream to Muhammara. Previously to this date the Iraqi Government had at various times had occasion to complain to the Persian Government of violations of the Iraqi sovereignty in the Shatt-al- Arab by its agents in the departments of Customs and Police, when they were reported to be patrolling the river, interfering with country craft, etc. Complaints were generally met with denials or allegations that the incidents complained of had occurred in “ Persian waters or the “ Persian waters of the Shatt-al-Arab ”. T ^ 1r0 P 1 ^ lpie of the arrival of the Persian war-vessels, however, it became clear that r erSian °® cers were acting under orders to disregard the rules and by-laws of the Port of Basra and to flout the authority of the Directorate, by entering the dredged Rooka Channel, which is open to one-way traffic only, without ascertaining from the control officer the channel was clear, by ignoring the signals of the control officer and other competent authorities, by anchoring in the prohibited area and showing great reluctance to move when requested to do so, by steaming at excessive speeds, and by similar breaches of the rules. Apart from the legal irregularity of these proceedings, the rash seamanship of the ersian officers is highly objectionable for other reasons : it has caused at least one serious groun in £ j several occasions collisions have been narrowly averted ; the dredged channel is constantly m jeopardy ; a collision involving an outward-bound tanker carrying dangerous oi s migfit have the most serious consequences ; any blocking of the river would bring to a standstd! the whole seaborne trade of Iraq (the Shatt-al-Arab constituting Iraq’s sole channel of access to the sea), not to mention the oil trade of Persia itself. It has been found ms titute, at considerable expense, wireless watches on all port vessels an wirefess stations m order that timely warning of the approach of Persian ships may be passed on and a wide berth be given to them? nff . ^ course of an informal interview on March 19th, 1933, the Persian Senior Naval tho whnin ne fi° q? Director that Persia did not recognise the sovereignty of Iraq ° v mnlri n\i ° T ^^[Dal-Arab or the Basra Port Administration, and that therefore could not comply with its rules. Pot,^!:-, 18 ^P^ory for every sea-going vessel navigating within the limit 8 of tjm mid down in in though certain Government vessels are exempt from pilotage, it is c , Is the fn r n w that this exem Ption does not apply in harbour limits; it has been ^ }1 iai uo iir-niasters to berth men-of-war of all nationalities inside the hlimits of Basra and Abbadan Reach. These facilities were used by the Persian vessels for a few months until, on June ^3rd, 1933, Captain McLeod, Harbour-Master of the Port of Basra, who, in the normal course of his duties, had boarded the Persian ship Palana was arrested and sent to Munammara, where he was detained for seven days. In reply to the protests against this outrage on one of its officials in Iraqi waters, the following replv was received by the Iraqi Minister at Teheran from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs : Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to Bis Excellency Towfiq Beg Buwaidi Iraqi Minister in Teheran, No. 13164, dated July 3rd, 1933. [Translation.] “ Monsieur le Ministre Plenipotentiaire, “ In reply to your letter ISTo. 1242 regarding the arrest of McLeod by the Persian Naval Forces in Southern Persia, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that : “ (1) The harbour of Abbadan belongs to Persian territory. The appointment of a harbour-master by the Iraqi Government is, therefore, contrary to international decisions and practice. Since I imagine, or rather am convinced, that Your Excellency has made a mistake in preparing your letter under reference, I have reminded you of this in order to prevent fruitless misunderstanding between the two Governments. “ (2) It appears from reports received by me from the competent authorities that while the vessel Palang, which belongs to the Imperial Persian Government, was cruising in Persian waters in the Shatt-al-Arab and proceeding towards the Persian bank, the said McLeod suddenly went on board without obtaining permission. Since it is strictly forbidden for persons to go on board Persian ships without permission, the naval authorities in Southern Persia concerned arrested him and then released him after explaining his error to him. ' I therefore particularly request Your Excellency that strict instructions may be issued to all officials concerned of the Iraqi Government to refrain from committing such illegal actions, so that misunderstanding in this matter may be avoided.” In the meantime the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs had addressed to the Persian Legation on May 13th, June 13th and July 11th, 1933, notes detailing the manner to which the Persian ships had disobeyed port rules and ignored the Port Authority, protesting against the consequent infringement of Iraqi sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab, and inviting the Persian Government to instruct its officials to comply with the rules. Finally, the following reply was received to the third of these notes, which had reference in particular to the movements of the Persian ship Simurgh on June 19th : “ Persian Legation to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, No. 1968, of August 22nd, 1933. “ The Imperial Persian Legation at Baghdad has the honour to reply to the note of the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs No. 6376, of July 11th, 1933, regarding a complaint against the warship Simurgh and to inform them that the ersian v are in no need of the assistance of the Harbour-Master of Ba.sra and j a they do not require to employ him at all. Furthermore, any discussmn o is quite useless until the negotiations with the Iraqi Goyernmen or of the question of the Shatt-al-Arab and the delimitation of the boundaries there betw ee the two States are finally ended.” The irregular activities of the Persian departments of Customs and Police increased after the arrival of the Persian war-vessels. No useful purpose characteristic reproducing the voluminous correspondence that has resulte , f rom Abbadan case may be mentioned. On March 25th, 1933, the Persian Customs otto al from Abbadan went across to the floating dock of the Anglo-Persian Oil P ^ i was received searched it and confiscated a quantity of piece-goods. The following p y to the Iraqi protest : “Persian Legation to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, So. 3178, of October 1st, 1933. [Translation.] £t The Imperial Persian Legation in Baghdad o j 1 and 6378 5 of May^nd/Srd and notes of the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Nos. 3721 and 6378, of may /July 11th, 1933, complaining against Parviz Khan and certain other Persian Gust officials, to invite attention to the Legation’s note No. 1968, dated August 22nd Um Since the said officials did not violate Iraqi territory, and since the smuggled’^' which they discovered were not elsewhere than in the dock belonging to the C Persian Oil Company which appertains to the Persian harbour of Abbadan, the nroW contained in the Ministry’s first memorandum is baseless.” The eccentric behaviour of the Persian war-vessels and the irregularities of the Custom^ and Police departments have continued in 1934, and given rise to much correspondence In October, the Iraqi Government was obliged to protest against a new activity •'the Persian authorities, by threatening to refuse entry to cargo destined for Persia were endeavouring to oblige ships anchored in the Shatt-al-Arab to fly the Persian instead of the Iraqi flag. Finally, in November, the Iraqi Government instructed its Legation in Teheran to protest in the following terms against the prolonged stay in Iraqi waters of a gunboat to act as parentship to armed patrols : [Translation.'] “ The Royal Iraqi Legation presents its compliments to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and bias the honour to state that it has come to the notice of the Iraqi Government that the Persian gunboat Gailan has been moored in Abbadan Harbonr since September 3rd, 1934, and is acting as a base ship from which armed ratings are sent on patrol up and down the river at night. Since the right of navigation in the Shatt-al-Arab which is secured to Persian vessels by Article 2 of the Treaty of Erzerum never has been and cannot be held to cover the protracted stay of a war-vessel without formal permission or the maintenance of river police or military patrol in Iraqi waters, the Legation is instructed to enquire how long the Persian naval authorities desire that the said gunboat shall remain in its present position and to request that instructions shall be sent to the same authorities to discontinue patrols of the Mud referred to.” B. PERSIAN POLICE POSTS IN IRAQI TERRITORY. Since June 1931, at various times, the following police posts have been erected by the Persian authorities in Iraqi territory : Place Near boundary- Approximate date Approximate date 1. Chigha Surkh . . . pillars 47 of establishment June 1931 of withdrawal August 1931 2. Bajliya 22-23 September 1931 October 1934 3. Shirish 18-19 January 1932 — 4. Aiwa (Safariya) . . 18-19 July 1932 — 5. Imam Nai Khidhr . 35 April 1932 — 6. Kani Sukht .... 33-34 September 1934 — The first post at Chigha Surkh gave little trouble ; the Persian Government admitted the mistake made by its local agents and the post was dismantled a little over a month after its construction. In the autumn of 1931, the Persian frontier officials in the region adjoining the Iraqi province of Amara appeared to be undertaking — quite legitimately — a programme o administrative consolidation. In September it was found that they had built one of their new police posts at Bajliya in Iraq ; also that Persian police cars were regularly using tracks and that a telephone line had been constructed in Iraqi territory between pm aK 15 and 21 ; moreover, the Persian officials had established certain Persian tribesmen in the lands _ of Shirish to the west of the Shatt-al-A’ma (which forms the boundary between pillars 18 and 19, lands from which Iraqi tribesmen had been withdrawn ^ previous year with a view to the prevention of inter-tribal quarrels over the ngn cultivation. A long and profitless correspondence ensued, first between the Iraqi Mutasarrif of Amara and the Persian Wali of Khuzistan, and later through the diplomatic channel. c emandmg the withdrawal of the post at Bajliya, and later of two more posts insta msh and Aiwa (Safariya), furnishing detailed descriptions and maps in suppor statements and suggesting inspection by a joint committee of technical experts to resoi any doubts as to the exact position of the places in question : Persia reiterating its elan e p aces were in Persia and generally ignoring but sometimes refusing the propos a joint enquiry on the spot.IS r, In August 1934, an Iraqi post was established at Chilaib Saih in Iraqi territory 18 miles ke do f i from Bajliya. Agreement was then reached in October between the two Governments for the &gt; abolition of both posts. The Persian posts at Shirish and Aiwa (Safariya), however, remain. % Prom April 1931 to April 1932, following quarrels between the Iraqi Bani Lam and Persian Khizil tribesmen regarding grazing rights at a place called Imam Aai Khidhr near pillar 35, correspondence was exchanged between the two Governments with regard to its Uheiiw,, position in relation to the boundary. On March 10th, 1932, the Persian Minister enrh e / !iIi: Plenipotentiary addressed a note (Ho. 5968) to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs jst containing the following threat regarding a patrol which had been sent to keep order in cargo ^ ie area ' : “ Since this action is considered a violation of Persian territory and is inconsistent iflstottojJ S 00( ^ re l a G ons between the two Governments and is opposed to bon-voisinage, P( %d jt-, I am instructed by my Government to request Your Excellency to take urgent steps to recall the said soldiers from the lands of Hai Khidhr or Khidhr Zind, and at the same time I am to make clear that, if the Iraqi soldiers do not evacuate the said place, the forces of the Imperial Government will be obliged to take military action to eject them.” lent8 W% ® to tie i|'. ® m ooreiii|| ipfromitiei^ cet Ntift&gt; ^edstayoSanis Porsian i poik iiij foOBtifllpi: lice posts tote date nent 1931 32 If! Ottite ry The Iraqi Government replied (March 16th, 1931), suggesting that representatives of the two Governments should proceed to the spot together to determine the exact position of Imam Hai Khidhr. The Persian Legation, by its note Ho. 2084 of April 14th, 1932, transmitted a refusal. In the meantime, on April 6th, the Persian military authorities had established a permanent post at Imam Hai Khidhr ; they subsequently built a fort about two miles inside Iraqi territory. For a whole year correspondence followed the familiar lines, the Persian Government replying to all protests that Imam Hai Khidhr wasin contestably in Persia. The following letters exchanged since April 1933 must be quoted in exlenso : “ Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to Royal Iraqi Legation, Teheran, No. 3799, of April 18th, 1933. [Translation.] “ The Ministry for Foreign Affairs present their compliments to the Koyal Iraqi Legation, and, in continuation of their note Ho. 28227, have the honour to inform it that His Excellency the Minister Plenipotentiary has had- hitherto two or three conversations with the Director of the Oriental Section relating to the establishment of the police post in the hills situated in the Maimak mountains, and has informed him that the officials of the Imperial Persian Government have established a post in the above-mentioned hills. The Ministry now desire to state, as they had actually declared in their note under reference, that the police have taken no measures to establish the post in the hills situated to the west of the Maimak mountains ; but those officials have established a post at the spring of Hai Khidhr (Tirshak), which falls within Persian territory. The Ministry, however, request the Legation to produce its evidences and documents, if any, to support its allegations in order to enable them to cairy ou the necessary investigation again.” “ Royal Iraqi Legation, Teheran, to Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, No. 969, of September 24th, 1933.

The Iraqi Government therefore earnestly invites the Persian Government, in confirmation of previous requests, to give early orders for the evacuation by the Persian military and police detachments of the posts erected at Imam Nai, Aiwa, iShirish and Bajliya, within Iraqi territory. 3- The Iraqi Government, convinced of the real community of the interests of the two States, takes this opportunity of confirming to the Persian Governmen that, subject to the understanding that the boundary delimited in 1914 is final an there can be no derogation from Iraqi sovereignty over any territory or waters wit m le boundaries of Iraq according to the said delimitation, it is w T illing and anxious o resume, in the most friendly spirit, the negotiation of the series of treaties conventions which have already formed the subject of discussion; it believes t a, giv en the necessary atmosphere of mutual confidence and goodwill, a satisfacto y cai1 be found, in the course of the conversations, for all administrative i iculties pending between the two Governments.” No reply has been received to this note up to the present date.«10fl l i&gt; In September 1934, the Persian authorities established a new post at Kani Sukht tt; about three miles on the Iraqi side of the boundary, in the neighbourhood of pillars 33 and 34. The protests of the Iraqi Government have received the usual reply that the nlaee is incontestably within Persian territory. 1 J P ^ In addition to the posts mentioned above, the Persian authorities have built posts actually on the boundary-line and thus encroaching a few yards into Iraqi territorv at Oabristan and Sofijana, near pillar 72. ^ C. BINAWA SUTA. The ownership of a small triangle of territory called Sarkoshk, near pillars 89 and 90 ! ^tiitijias at various times formed the subject of dispute between the people of the Iraqi village 3 f Binawa Suta and the Persian village of Bayawa. The question was examined by the Delimitation Commission of 1914, which placed the triangle on the Turkish (Iraqi) side ttr ^biiy the boundary-line. In 1928, the villagers of Bayawa occupied the triangle by force. The Iraqi Mutasarrif h Sulaimani opened negotiations with the Persian Governor of Meriwan with a view to Hm;, r ..securing the recall of the usurping Persian villagers. Local efforts having produced no ■'Result, the Iraqi Legation at Teheran, on August 11th, 1932, addressed a note to the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. In spite of many reminders, no reply was received until March 1934, when a note was received from the Persian Government, of which the following i Legation.

THE GUN JAN CHAM RIVER. This river rises in the Persian province of Pusht-i-Kuh and flows south-westwards. The median line forms the boundary for about 12 miles from pillar 32 to pillar 31, where it becomes an entirely Iraqi stream and flows on to Badra. The Iraqi township of Zurbatiya and the surrounding arable lands receive their water by canals taking off from the right bank of the Gunjan Cham in this sector between pillars 32 and 31 ; arable lands on the Persian side are similarly irrigated by canals taking off from the left bank. There appears to have been no serious dispute regarding the division of the water up to 1930 ; in that year a difference between Iraqi and Persian tribesmen attracted attention and was settled without difficulty by minor officials on the spot. But, in the spring o , the newly installed Persian Military Governor of Mansurabad, desiring to establish hitherto nomadic tribesmen on the land and to increase cultivation on the Persian Side, dug a i ie w canal. As the summer advanced and the water fell, he built a dam right across t re rrvm &gt;e&lt; , the medium filum aquce of which, as mentioned above, here forms the boundary, an diverted all the water into Persia. 1 _ 0 . ,, T . • fT .„ On March 17th, July 26th, August 30th and September 9th, 1931, the Uaqi Mmist y for Foreign Affairs addressed complaints to the Persian Legation an P re ® appointment of a mixed commission to make enquiries on the spot and agreement, based on previous custom, regarding the proportions m w nc ' T ,. Gunjan Cham were to be enjoyed by the inhabitants of the two banks. £ replied as follows : “ Persian Legation to Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, No. 2573, of Seytem 20th, 1931.

The Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs will doubtless admit that in dew of the above-mentioned circumstances and the fact that the surplus water is f to Zurbatiya as before, there is no need to form a commission for this purpose Imperial Persian Legation avails, etc. ” The Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, in its No. 22988/101553 of September 30tli 1931, replied somewhat differently to the parallel representations made by the Iraqi Legation in Teheran. [Translation.] “ In answer to the note of the Boyal Iraqi Legation, No. 751, regarding the complaint of the people of Zurbatiya against the cutting off of the surplus waters of the river Gunjan Cham from Zurbatiya, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs has the honour to inform the Legation that the reports received from the authorities concerned all indicate that the surplus waters of the said river were and are still flowing to Zurbatiya. This Ministry has also issued strict instructions to the local officials in Mansurabad to supervise the flow of the surplus of the said waters to Iraqi territory as usual. Furthermore, this Ministry has communicated to the authorities concerned the contents of the Legation’s note under reply, and has asked by telegraph for an enquiry into the matter and the issue of necessary instructions for urgent steps to be taken for the return of the waters to Zurbatiya if they have in fact been cut off. This Ministry is now occupied in studying the proposal of the Iraqi Government regarding the meeting of a joint commission to investigate the claims of the people of Zurbatiya regarding the cutting off of the surplus water of the Gunjan Cham from Iraqi territory, and the aggressions committed against them in this connection. The Legation will be informed of the result as soon as possible.” The following notes were then exchanged : “ Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs to Persian Legation, No. 4790, of October 5th, Idol [Translation.] “ The Ministry for Foreign Affairs present their compliments to the Imperial Persian Legation and have the honour to refer to its note No. 2573 of September 20th, 1931, and to express their regret at the statement contained in the Legation's note to the effect that ‘ the part of the Boundary Delimitation Agreement of 1914, which relates to the delimitation of the boundary with Iraq, has not been recognised as official, Since the above-mentioned Agreement, including the provisions relating to the delimitation of the Iraqi-Persian boundary, is valid, and since the delimitation of the Iraqi-Persian boundary was completed seventeen years ago, the Ministry believe that the Legation did not mean by its note under reference anything to prejudice tie present situation which the Iraqi Government consider as official and final. 1 e Ministry avail, etc.” Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs to Persian Legation, No. 5434, of November 2nd, • [Translation.] “ ^he Ministry for Foreign Affairs present their compliments to the Persian Legation in Baghdad and have the honour to refer to its note Ao. ^ September 20th, 1931, and to inform it that the Iraqi Government have found nm s in the decisions of the Boundary Delimitation Commission of 1914, defining any rc&amp; for the Zurbatiya water.

The Imperial Government cannot tolerate the damage which it sustained on account of the said Agreement. Therefore, the Imperial Persian Government does not consider at any time the said Agreement as official, and maintains its former objections until such time as this matter is discussed between the two Governments and the said differences are removed.

The Persian Government replied to all complaints with the statement that Zurbatiya was receiving all the water to which was entitled — namely, the surplus after the Persian cultivators had drawn oil eir requirements — and put forward counter-complaints to the effect that the people of Zur batiya were interfering with Persian canals.

[E 7220/197/34] No. 1. Sir F. Humphrys to Sir John Simon.—(Received December 3.) (No. 672.) Sir, Bagdad, November 22, 1934. WITH reference to my despatch No. 666 of the 17th November, I have the “I honour to transmit herewith a copy of the communication which the Iraqi Govern ment propose to send to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations concerning their frontier dispute with Persia, and also a copy of Part A of the third appendix, which will be attached thereto. 2. These two papers, together with the enclosures to Nuri Pasha’s letter of the 15th November (copies of which were forwarded with my despatch referred to above), complete the original documents which it is intended to send to the Secretary- General. ( x ) 3. You will observe that the letter to the Secretary-General follows the draft of the 4th October, prepared by Mr. Edmonds in consultation with experts in the Foreign Office, except in so far as that draft has been amended in the manner indicated in Nuri Pasha’s letter of the 15th November. The reference to the inclusion of maps in Appendix III, contained in the additions to paragraph 2 mentioned in Nuri Pasha’s letter, has, however, been omitted, as it is not yet certain that sufficient maps can be obtained for this purpose (see my telegram No. 246 of the 20th November). If available they will be forwarded to the Secretary-General with a subsequent communication. 4. Nuri Pasha tells me that he has informed the Persian Minister in Bagdad of the Iraqi Government’s intention to refer the frontier question to the League of Nations, but that at the same time he assured Samii Khan that this did not mean that the door was closed to an agreement out of court. The Iraqi Govern ment would always be ready to consider any proposals which the Persian Govern ment might see fit to put forward and, if a settlement were reached by direct negotiation, they would, of course, withdraw their application for the intervention of the League of Nations. 5. According to Nuri Pasha, Samii Khan gave it as his opinion that the Persian Government would prefer that a settlement should be negotiated directly with the Iraqi Government rather than through the mediation of the League. He said that the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs was preparing the drafts of three different proposals which, he hoped, would be received in Bagdad within a few days for discussion with the Iraqi Government. Nuri Pasha gathered, however, that these drafts were unlikely to contain anything more acceptable than the proposals which Kazemi had made orally to him during the course of his visit to Bagdad last month. His view is that the Persians are merely playing for time and that it will be necessary to bring the matter to the notice of the League without delay in order to minimise the risk of further embarrassing incidents. I have, &amp;c. F. H. HUMPHRYS. Enclosure in No. 1. Iraqi Government to the Secret ary -General of the League of Nations, Geneva. Sir, Bagdad, November 1934. I HAVE the honour to inform you that for some time past, and particularly during the last two years, great anxiety has been caused to the Koyai Iraqi Government by persistent disregard and violation of the Iraqi-Persian Iron xer by official agents of the Imperial Persian Government. P) Le., Parts B, C and D, which have been printed, for the sake of convenience, with the present paper. ■HmHSmH2. The frontier between Iraq and Persia is derived from the Treaty of Erzerum of 1847 (Appendix I),( 2 ) and a protocol signed at Constantinople on the 4th November, 19(3T by the Grand Vizier and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Ottoman Empire and the Ambassador of Persia, on behalf of the two parties, and by the Ambassadors of Great Britain and Russia, on behalf of their respective countries in the capacity of mediating Powers. Section V of this protocol specifically laid down that as soon as any part of the frontier had been delimited ' by the Delimitation Commission to be set up in accordance with section II, that part should be held to have been finally fixed and should not be open either to subsequent examination or to revision. The delimitation of the frontier on the ground provided for in section II was carried out by this commission in the year 1914. A print containing the Protocol of 1913 and the Proceedings of the Commission of 1914 is attached as Appendix II.f) 3. In spite of the legal position as outlined above, the Imperial Persian Government have consistently disregarded and violated the frontier so established. A summary of some of the more flagrant acts of aggression, with copies of the relevant correspondence, is attached (Appendix III). As will be seen from this correspondence, the Imperial Persian Government attempt to justify their conduct on the ground that they do not recognise the validity of the frontier and do not consider themselves bound by the arrangements by which it was determined. This view the Royal Iraqi Government are unable to accept. 4. The Royal Iraqi Government has hitherto been loath to formulate publicly a complaint against a neighbour and fellow member of the League of Nations. It has left nothing undone in its endeavour to settle the matters at issue direct with the Imperial Persian Government. As will be seen from the correspondence, the numerous conciliatory proposals which it has made, whether for the investigation by joint commissions of particular problems affected by the precise alignment of the frontier, or for the general examination of all causes of inconvenience to either side arising from that alignment, with a view to eliminating the inconvenience by appropriate administrative arrangements, have been consistently rejected or ignored. 5. The continuance of the state of affairs described in the preceding paragraphs cannot fail to disturb the good understanding between Iraq and Persia which Iraq so earnestly desires. With great regret, therefore, the Royal Iraqi Government sees no alternative but to bring the circumstances to the attention of the Council under article 11, paragraph 2, of the Covenant. 6. I have the honour accordingly to request that you will be so good as to cause this matter to be placed on the agenda for consideration by the Council at its next session. 7. A copy of this letter, with the appendices, is being communicated simultaneously to the Imperial Persian Government. [Appendices I and II not printed.] Appendix III to Enclosure. (A) —The Shatt-el-Arab. THE protocol of 1913 contains a clear and unambiguous description of the boundary on the Shatt-el-Arab :— ££ De ce point [i.e., from the mouth of the Nazaile canal] la f ron ^' e ^ suit le cours du Chatt-el-Arab jusqu’d la mer en laissant sous la souverain ottomane le fleuve et toutes les lies qui s’y trouventT There are two exceptions : The ownership by Persia of certain named and the continuance of the modern port and anchorage of Mohammera Persian jurisdiction. i- n2S A detailed description of the boundary line is embodied in the P l( b ce ^ of the second sitting of the Delimitation Commission and reproduce ^ Tableau descriptif de la Liqne-Frentiere annexed to the proceedings, ( a ) Not printed.fem iiktW e#.;. is described as following the low-water level of the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, leaving it only to the extent necessary to leave in Persia the named islands referred to above and the anchorage of Mohammerah. The Directorate of the Port of Basra derives its authority from the Inland Waters Shipping Proclamation, 1919, and the Port of Basra Proclamation, 1919, issued by the General Officer Commanding-in-chief, the British Forces in Iraq. Under article 114 of the Constitutional Law of Iraq these proclamations have the validity of Iraqi law. On the 9th November, 1932, two sloops and four gunboats recently acquired for the Persian navy entered the Shatt-el-Arab and proceeded up-stream to Mohammerah. . . Previously to this date the Iraqi Government had at various times had occasion to complain to the Persian Government of violations of the Iraqi sovereignty in the Shatt-el-Arab by its agents in the Departments of Customs and Police, who were reported to be patrolling the river, interfering with country craft, &amp;c. ' Complaints were generally met with denials or allegations that the incidents complained of had occurred in “Persian waters” or the “Persian waters of the Shatt-el-Arab.” From the date of the arrival of the Persian war vessels, however, it became clear that the Persian officers were acting under orders to disregard the rules and by-laws of the Port of Basra and to flout the authority of the Directorate by entering the dredged Rooka Channel, which is open to one-way traffic only, without ascertaining from the control officer that the channel was clear, by ignoring the signals of the pilot-master and other competent authorities, bv anchoring in the prohibited area, showing great reluctance to move when requeste to do so, by steaming at excessive speeds, and by similar breaches of the ru es. Apart from the Segal irregularity of these proceedings, the rash seamanship of the Persian officers is highly objectionable for other reasons; it has caused at least one serious grounding; on several occasions collisions have been narrowly averted; the dredged channel is constantly in jeopardy; a collision involving an outward-bound tanker carrying dangerous oils might have th f “fhUwhole sef quences- any blocking of the river would bring to a standstill the whole sea borne trade of Iraq (the Shatt-el-Arab constituting Iraq s soie ehannel of access to the sea), not to mention the oil trade of Persia itself. It has been f necessary to institute, at considerable expense, wire ess wa c ,, p ers i an and wireless stations in order that timely warning o pp ships may be passed on and a wide berth be giYen to em.

These facilities were used by the Persian s ^r of thUpUt of Basra! on the 23rd June, 1933, Ca P ta ^ ^gfhaTwded the Persian ship Palang, In reply to the protests against this outi age on o T j ri f roin the Persian the following reply was received by the Iraqi Minister at leniai Minister for Foreign Affairs :— , „ “Persian Minister for F° rei S\ Suwaidi, Iraqi Minister in Tehran, No. 13164, dated any , (Translation ^ “ M. le Ministre PlfniP ot ®”l iai re&gt; din „ t h e arrest of McLeod by “ In reply to your lettel „^; 12 p er fia : I lave the honour to inform the Persian naval forces in Southeii your Excellency that— . _ r™ “(1) The harbour of Abbadan ^Ulraqf Government is, therefore, appointment of a harbour-master by the Iraqi vxo ^ ^ [290 c—1]contrary to international decisions and practice. Since I imagine, or rath am convinced, that your Excellency has made a mistake in preparing yon 1 ' letter under reference, I have reminded you of this in order to prevent fruit 1 less misunderstanding between the two Governments. “ (2) It appears from reports received by me from the competent authorities that, while the vessel Palang, which belongs to the Imperial Persian Government, was cruising in Persian waters in the Shatt-el-Arab A and proceeding towards the Persian bank, the said McLeod suddenly went on board without obtaining permission. Since it is strictly forbidden for persons to go on board Persian ships without permission, the naval authorities in Southern Persia concerned arrested him and then released him after explaining his error to him. C£ I therefore particularly request your Excellency that strict instruc tions may be issued to all officials concerned of the Iraqi Government to refrain from committing such illegal actions, so that misunderstanding in this matter may be avoided. ££ I avail, &amp;c.” In the meantime, the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs had addressed to the Persian Legation on the 13th May, the 13th June and the 11th July, 1933, notes detailing the manner to which the Persian ships had disobeyed port rules and ignored the port authority, protesting against the consequent infringement of Iraqi sovereignty over the Shatt-el-Arab, and inviting the Persian Govern ment to instruct its officials to comply with the rules. Finally, the following reply was received to the third of these notes, which had reference in particular to the movements of the Persian ship Simurgh on the 19th June :— ' Persian Legation to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, No. 1968 of August &lt; 2 i l, 1933. The Imperial Persian Legation at Bagdad has the honour to reply to the note of the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, No. 6376 of the 11th July, 1933, regarding a complaint against the warship Simurgh, and to inform them that the Persian vessels are in no need of the assistance of the harbour master of Basra, and that therefore they do not require to employ him at all. Furthermore, any discussion of such cases is quite useless until the negotiations with the Iraqi Government for the settlement of the question of the Shatt-el-Arab and the delimitation of the boundaries there between the two States are finally ended.” The irregular activities of the Persian Departments of Police and Customs increased after the arrival of the Persian war vessels. No useful purpose would be served by reproducing the voluminous correspondence that has resulted, but one characteristic case may be mentioned. On the 25th March, 1933, the Persian customs official from Abbadan went across to the floating dock of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company well out in the stream, searched it and confiscated a quantity of piece-goods. The following reply was received to the Iraqi protest:— Persian Legation to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, No. 3178 of October 1, 1933. (Translation.) The Imperial Persian Legation in Bagdad has the honour, in reph to the two notes of the Royal Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Nos. 3721 and and 6378 of the 2nd-3rd May and the G 1th July, 1933, complaining against Parviz Khan and certain other Persian customs officials, to invite attention to the Legation’s note, dated the 22nd August, 1933. Since the said officials did not violate Iraqi territory, and since the smuggled goods which they discovered were not elsewhere than in the dock belonging to the South Persian Oil Company which appertains to the Persian harbour of Abbadan, the protest contained in the Ministry’s first memorandum is baseless. The eccentric behaviour of the Persian war vessels and the irregularities of the Customs and Police Departments have continued in 1934 and given use o much correspondence.In October the Iraqi Government was obliged to protest against a new activity; the Persian authorities, by threatening to refuse entry to cargo destined f or Persia, were endeavouring to oblige ships anchored in the Shatt-el-Arab to fly the Persian instead of the Iraqi flag. Finally, in November the Iraqi Government instructed its Legation in Tehran to protest in the following terms against the prolonged stay in Iraqi waters of a gunboat to act as parent-ship to armed patrols : “ The Royal Iraqi Legation presents its compliments to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to state that it has come to the notice of the Iraqi Government that the Persian gunboat Gailan has been moored in Abbadan Harbour since the 3rd September, 1934, and is acting as a base ship from which armed ratings are sent on patrol up and down the river at night. Since the right of navigation in the Shatt-el-Arab which is secured to Persian vessels by article 2 of the Treaty of Erzerum never has been and cannot be held to cover the protracted stay of a war vessel without formal permission or the maintenance of river police or military patrols in Iraqi waters, the Legation is instructed to enquire how long the Persian naval authorities desire that the said gunboat shall remain in its present position, and to request that instructions shall be sent to the same authorities to discontinue patrols of the kind referred to.” (B) —Persian Police Posts in Iraqi Territory. Since June 1931, at various times, the following police posts have been erected by the Persian authorities in Iraqi territory : Place. Near Boundary Pillars. Approximate Date of Establishment. Approximate Date of Withdrawal. 1. Chigha Surkh 2. Bagliya .. 3. Shirish .. 4. Aiwa (Safariya) .. 5. Imam Nai Khidhr 6. Kani Sukht 47 22-23 18-19 18-19 35 33-34 June 1931 . .

On the 10th March, 1932, the then Persian Minister Plenipotentiary addressed a note (No. 5968) to the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, containing the follownw threat regarding a patrol which had been sent to keep order in the area : b “ Since this action is considered a violation of Persian territory and is inconsistent with the good relations between the two Governments and is opposed to ‘ Bon-Voisinage,’ I am instructed by my Government to request your Excellency to take urgent steps to recall the said soldiers from the lands of Nai Khidhr or Khidhr Zind, and at the same time I am to make clear that if the Iraqi soldiers do not evacuate the said place, the forces of the Imperial Government will be obliged to take military action to eject them.” The Iraqi Government replied (the 16th March, 1932) suggesting that representatives of the two Governments should proceed to the spot together to determine the exact position of Imam Nai. The Persian Legation, by its note of the 14th April, 1932, transmitted a refusal. In the meantime, on the 6th April, the Persian military authorities had established a permanent post at Imam Nai Khidhr; they subsequently built a fort about 2 miles inside Iraqi territory. For a whole year correspondence followed the familiar lines,' the Persian Government replying to all protests that Imam Nai Khidhr was incontestably in Persia. The following letters exchanged since April 1933 must be quoted in extenso :— ''Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to Royal Iraqi Legation, Tehran, No. 3799 of April 18, 1933. “ (Translation.) ‘ l The Ministry for Foreign Affairs present their compliments to the Royal Iraqi Legation, and, in continuation of their note No. 28227, have the honour to inform it that His Excellency the Minister Plenipotentiary has had hitherto two or three conversations with the Director of the Oriental Section relating to the establishment of the police post in the hills situated in the Maimak Mountains, and has informed him that the officials of the Imperial Persian Government did establish a post in the above-mentioned hills. The Ministry now desire to state, as they had actually declared in their note under reference, that the police have taken no measures to establish the post in the hills situated to the west of the Maimak Mountains; but those officials have established a post at the spring of Nai Khidhr (Tirshak), which falls within Persian territory. The Ministry, however, request the Legation to produce its evidences and documents, if any, to support its pretension in order to be able to carry out the necessary investigation again.” 11 Royal Iraqi Legation, Tehran, to Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, No. 969 of September 24, 1933. “ (Translation.) The Royal Iraqi Legation presents its compliments to the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to refer to correspondence ending with the Ministry’s note No. 3799 of the 18th April, 1933, relating to the incident of the police post of Nai Khidhr. “ The Legation observes that the Ministry’s note under reference does not differ in meaning from their previous note No. 28227, in spite of all the evidence and proofs which have been produced by the Legation, and which leave no doubt that the place contested is within Iraqi territory. ' Am official map had previously been forwarded to the Ministry, indicating the long distance between Tirshik, where the Persian authorities claim that the police post had been established, and Nai Khidhr, situated within Iraqi territory, which is the actual site of the said post. “ With the above-mentioned map there was also forwarded a photograph which shows clearly the situation of the post, and which casts on the whole question a light making any discussion about the genuineness of the claini of the Legation unnecessary. The Legation, however, has obtained no result7 except what had always been repeated, namely, the demand for evidence and documents which could prove its statement. These proofs it did produce in so clear a manner that, in its opinion, any discussion on the subject would be needless; yet, in order to avoid any misunderstanding and to settle disputes in the cordial spirit prevalent between the two States, the Legation bad suggested to its Government to despatch a technical committee to study the question more deeply on the spot, and to make quite sure that the Persian police post was erected within Iraqi territory. (£ The Iraqi Ministry of Defence accordingly entrusted the task to two military engineers of the General Staff. The outcome was a lengthy report founded on technical considerations studied on the spot, of which the Legation cites here the following extracts :— “The Extracts. “ [Not reproduced.] “ From the above, the Ministry will observe that the Iraqi Government had despatched this committee and incurred the resulting expense and trouble only to prove the genuineness of its point of view. The Legation observes with satisfaction that the result confirmed by technical enquiry was consistent with what had previously been put forward. “ The Legation would like to add that the question of the post under reference resembles in some of its aspects that of the Chigha Surkh post, the evacuation of which the Imperial Government had ordered as soon as it was satisfied that its point of view was not well founded. £ £ In view of the details quoted above, the Legation is confident that the Ministry will lose no time in giving the same attention to the matter, and handling it in the same manner as that in which the question of the Chigha Surkh post was treated.” ££ Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to Royal Iraqi Legation, No. 159 of March 25, 1934. ^ ££ In answer to the letter of the Royal Iraqi Legation, No. 969, dated the 23rd September, 1933, relating to the claim of the Legation regarding the construction by Persian officials on the houndary o a oi ° ® p • Jabal Maimak, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of ^ Government have the honour to inform the Legation that the Legation nas in the said memorandum taken as its authority the boun ary e i protocol of 1914, and explained that the said fort had been built to the we of pillar 35 in a place called Imam Nai.

The Iraqi Government ther fore, earnestly invites the Persian Government, in confirmation of previous requests, to give early orders for the evacuation by the Persian military and police detachments, of the posts erected at Imam Nai, Aiwa, Shirish and Bajliya within Iraqi territory. “3. The Iraqi Government, convinced of the real community of the interests of the two States, takes this opportunity of confirmino- to the Persian Government that, subject to the understanding that the boundary demarcated in 1914 is final, and there can be no derogation from Iraqi sovereignty over any territory or waters within the boundaries of Iraq according to the said demarcation, it is willing and anxious to resume in the most friendly spirit the negotiation of the series of treaties and conventions which have already formed the subject of discussion; it believes that, given the necessary atmosphere of mutual confidence and goodwill, a satisfactory solution can be found, in the course of the conversations, for all administra tive difficulties pending between the two Governments.” No reply has been received to this note up to the present date. In September 1934 the Persian authorities established a new post at Kani Sukht, about 3| miles on the Iraqi side of the boundary, in the neighbourhood of pillars 33 and 34. The protests of the Iraqi Government have received the usual reply that the place is incontestably within Persian territory. In addition to the posts mentioned above, the Persian authorities have built posts actually on the boundary line, and thus encroaching a few yards into Iraqi territory at Qabristan and Sofijana near pillar 72. (C )—Binawa Suta. ownership of a small triangle of territory called Sarkushk, near pillars J and 90, has at various times formed the subject of a dispute between the people of the Iraqi village of Binawa Suta and the Persian village of Bayawa; e question was examined by the Delimitation Commission of 1914, which placed le triangle on the Turkish (Iraqi) side of the boundary line. M the villagers of Bayawa occupied the triangle by force. The Iraqi Mutessarif of Sulaimani opened negotiations with the Persian Governor of T eri 1 wa !J W1 th a view to securing the recall of the usurping Persian villagers. 11 (&gt; f c j a ellorts fi avm g produced no result, the Iraqi Legation at Tehran on the 1 ugust, 1932, addressed a note to the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, n spite ql many reminders no reply was received until March 1934, when a note was received from the Persian Government, of which the following is the relevant extract:— Persian Ministry far Foreign Affairs to the Royal Iraqi Legation, Tehran, No. 47185 of March 20, 1934. “ (Translation.

But as regards the reference by the Legation in its note No. 1016 to the Protocol of 1914, the Ministry desires to draw the attention of the Legation to its answer No. 24896 (the number was subsequently corrected by the Ministry to 159, i.e., the note quoted above in connexion with Imam Nai Khidhr).” (D )—The Gunjan Cham River. This river rises in the Persian Province of Pusht-i-Kuh and flows south- westwards. The median line forms the boundary for about 12 miles from pillar 32 to pillar 31, where it becomes an entirely Iraqi stream and flows on to Badra. The Iraqi township of Zurbatiya and the surrounding arable lands receive their water by canals taking ofl from the right bank of the Gun j an Cham in this sector between pillars 32 and 31; arable lands on the Persian side are similarly irrigated by canals taking ofl from the left bank. There appears to have been no serious dispute regarding the division of the water up to 1930; in that year a difference between Iraqi and Persian tribesmen attracted attention and was settled without difficulty by minor officials on the spot. But in the spring of 1931 the newly-installed Persian Military Governor of Mansurabad, desiring to establish hitherto nomadic tribesmen on the land and to increase cultivation on the Persian side, dug a new canal; as the summer advanced and the water fell he built a dam right across the river bed, the medium filum aqua of which, as mentioned above, here forms the boundary, and diverted all the water into Persia. On the 17th March, the 26th July, the 30th August and the 9th September, 1931, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed complaints to the Persian Legation and pressed for the appointment of a mixed commission to make enquiries on the spot and elaborate an agreement, based on previous custom, regarding the proportions in which the waters of the Gunjan Cham were to be enjoyed by the inhabitants of the two banks. The Persian Legation replied as follows :— v “Persian Legation to Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, No. 2573 of September 20, 1931. “ (Translation.) “ The Imperial Persian Legation in Bagdad has the honour to refer to the Ministry’s note No. 4169 of the 29th/30th August, 1931, and to inform them that the Imperial Government does not consent to the setting up ol the commission, referred to in the last paragraph of the note u ^der reference, oi the settlement of the question of the Zurbatiya water. Although t e par of the Boundary Delimitation Agreement of 1914 which relates to e delimitation of the boundary with Iraq has not been recognised as olhcial, nevertheless, even if action were based upon it, it is clearly stated, m me paragraph concerning the utilisation by the inhabitants of ui a iya o the Gunjan Cham water, that after the people inhabiting the bank of the said stream have used the water, the surplus will then be diiee e owai s Zurbatiya, as has been the practice up to the present time. e ques ion the water of this stream does not resemble that of the Gangir stream; it is impossible to fix the amount of the surplus of the w/J 61 f a a should be set up for the purpose of its distribution. The laqi i mis A Foreign Affairs will doubtless admit that, m view of fl the . abo ! e - 1 2f i ^ 1 fl 0 f ^ circumstances and the fact that the surplus water is owing o as before, there is no need to form a commission ioi this purpose. “ The Imperial Persian Legation avail, &amp;c. The Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, in its No. tations 30th September, 1931, replied somewhat differently to the parallel representatio , made by the Iraqi Legation in Tehran. “ (T ^In answer to the note of the Royal Iraqi the complaint of the people of Zurbatiya against the 'b^lhTign waters of the river Gunjan Cham from Zurbatiya the Mmistry tor loreig^ Affairs have the honour to inform the Legation a P [290 c—1]from the authorities concerned all indicate that the surplus waters of the H river were and are still flowing to Zurbatiya. This Ministry has also issTd strict instructions to the local officials in Mansurabad to supervise the fl ^ of the surplus of the said waters to Iraqi territory as usual Furthermo^ this Ministry has communicated to the authorities concerned the content the Legation’s note under reply, and has asked by telegraph for an enquir into the matter and the issue of necessary instructions for urgent steps to J taken for the return of the waters to Zurbatiya if they have m fact been cut off. This Ministry is now occupied in studying the proposal of the Iraqi Government regarding the meeting of a joint commission to investigate the claims of the people of Zurbatiya regarding the cutting off of the surplus waters of the Gunjan Cham from Iraqi territory, and the aggressions committed against them in this connexion. The Legation will be^nfnrmpH of the result as soon as possible.” The following notes were then exchanged :— “Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs to Persian Legation, No. 4790 of October 5, 1931.

The Imperial Government cannot tolerate the damage which it sustained on account of the said agreement. Therefore the Imperial Persian Government does not consider at any time the said agreement as official and maintains its former objections, until such time as this matter is discussed between the two Governments and the said differences are removed. “ The Legation avail, &amp;c.” “Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs, No. 6346 of December 16, 1931, to Persian Legation. “ The Ministry for Foreign Affairs presents its compliments to the Imperial Persian Legation in Bagdad, and has the honour to refer to its letter No. 3276, dated the 2nd December, 1931, and to inform it that the Iraqi Government cannot admit the objection of the Minister of the Imperial Persian Government, and that they have issued orders to their Minister in Tehran to ask for detailed explanations from the Central Persian Government.” The trouble over the waters of the Gunj an Cham was repeated in 1632, 1933, 1934.

He said that the Persian G-overnment found it difficult to believe that Iraqi action had been taken without consultation with His Majesty's Government, and that while realising that they had no right to demand an answer they would much like information on this pointo Secondly the Persian Government greatly hoped that when matter came before the Council Persia might count on His Majesty’s Government giving her case their favourable considerddoru I informed Ala that although His Majesty's Government had known of importance which Iraqi Government attached to frontier question, and had been kept generally informed by them, Iraqi action in sending in this appeal to the League was taken entirely on their own initiative*, As regards our attitude at Geneva, he would appreciate that His Majesty's Government as members of the Council, could not in any way commit themselves in advance in respect of a case which would obviously have to be decided on its merits when the time carnec I suggested to Ala, however, that Persian Government would do well to consider very carelully legal asnect of their position..

They had replied that they were advised that the frontier was legally valid and binding, but had encouraged Iraqi Government to take opportunity of Persian Minisuer for horeign Affairs' recent passage through Bagdad to seek to reach direct settlement. Presumably it was because Iraqi Government were dissatisfied with results of conversa- tions which had then taken place that they had decided to appeal to the League 0 Iraqi Government no doubt felt that until legal validity of existing frontier had been recognised and established, there could he no solid basis for negotiations. inSuion was, however, a gerso-Iraqi one, which tv/o governments rmiSb deal with in their own way, and which would have to be decided by the Council, of which His Majesty’s Government was a member, entirely on merits of* the case* Full record to you by despatch* Addressed to Tehran Ho. 156, repeated to Bagdad No, 225.In any further communication on this subject, please quote So.

The ^erBian Minister called on me this afternoon and discussed this questiono He said that the Iraqi Government 1 s action in appealing to the League had come as a complete surprise to the Persian Government* As I would remember the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs had last September expressed the hope that II, }L Government would use their influence to bring about an improvement in Perso~Xraqi relations* He had hoped that something might have been done during his visit to London* Kazemi had then rtaid a special visit to Bagdad and shown himself most conciliatory* All seemed to be going well when the Iraqi Government had suddenly produced this bombshell. Gould I give him any explanation ? 2c l reminded Ala that there had been no opportunity discussing Perso-Iraqi relations in London last 8 er&gt;te.afcer, Kazerai end Hurl had not after all met in London (as had at e time 'been contemnlated) and Kazeai s visit had been treacly brief. It was quite true, however, that there had. eaed some none of a direct settlement at Bagdad, and I knew . .at the Iraqi Government had been prepared to go a long way meet any reasonable Persian desiderata. But I understood tat the conversations in Bagdad had to no result, tzemi had, I gathered, promised, to make delinxt.e nrorrosa &gt; the Iraqi Government, but it seemed clear that if me so they had not been on lines which the Iraqi .vernment could accent. We had, however, only heard indirectly1 2*K&gt; of what hsf passed, eince the matter was oiw which was being dealt with by direct negotiation between the Iraqi and the Persian governments c Ala was in fact in a far better position than we to know exactly what had passed, at Bagdad and subsequently, since it was his Minister for Foreign Affairs who had been concerned, whereas we only received occasional accounts of the negotiations from the Iraqi Government, and could therefore only learn ox what took place at secondhand* 3, Ala then asked whether we had been aware of the Iraqi intention to raise this question at the League# He was obviously eager to know whether the Iraqis had consulted us. I replied that the story was a very old one and that we had long known that the Iraqis were anxious to get the legality of their frontier properly recognised* It was quite true that they had asked our opinion at one stage as to the legality of the frontier, and that we had replied that it seemed to us perfectly legal and valid in international law. They had taken their present step, however, of appealing to the League at this moment entirely on their own initiative * 4c Ala then briefly referred to the Persian position, which was that the frontier agreements, never having been ratified by the MejUs 5 . were of no validity; that the Turks themselves had never recognised the validity of the frontier; that it was in any case outrageous that the frontier in a waterway should run along one bank, since in international law such frontiers always :fo 1 low e d ' ho thalr/a g eto. 9 eto« 5* i replied that it seemed to me that the legal position was quite clear, and that frankly I did not think the Persians had a leg to stand on in this respect* On the Minis t-sr again mentioning the attitude of the Turks, I said th at it seemed to m shat this was irrelevant to the present issues which &amp; pu y legal a e « olegal, one between Persia and Iraq and could not be affected by the attitude of present-day Turkey, as regards the shatt frontier, there were, i believed, historical reasons which had led the Oommisaion to define the frontier as they had* But however this might be there were a large number of anomalous and peculiar frontiers* which were, however, perfectly valid and legal, and could only be modified by legal means* in this case it seemed to me, if I might say so, that the Persian Government had conducted their case in a most ill-advised manner* By ignoring the legal position and treating the frontier as though it did not esrist in the shatt and. elsewhere, they had made it for more necessary for the Iraqis to insist on their legal rights* it seemed to me clear that in the face of such tactics the Iraqis had no choice but to establish their legal position before they could contemplate any kind of compromise* I reminded the Minister that a sound practical solution had been proposed in the shape of the Conservancy Board convention. This would have given Persia on important voice in the control of the shatt-el-Arab waterway, and would have disposed of most of the anomalies of the present situation* Persia seemed to me to be sacrificing the' substance for the shadow by the attitude which she had taken up* 6&lt;s vlie Minister then asked whether we intended, to suppor o the Iraqi case at geneva* I replied that the issue was one be tween the Persian end Iraqi Governments, and that I did not see how we could define our attitude in such a dispute in advance 0 t admitted, however, that, speaking quite pexsonaj-^y, my sympathies were, in this particular quest ion, with Iraq, as I Sid not see how an? country in Iraq's position could acquiesce in the Persian contention that the frontier was not legally valid coo®valid, or accept without protest Persia's that frontier as though it did not exist* 7. Eventually the Minister explained that he had cease in the hope of enlisting our support for the Persian case. He gathered, however, from it hat t had said that there was no hope of doing this* 1 repeated that i had been speaking personally, but that anxious as we were to give him all reasonable assistance, I feared that in this case we should not be able to help him* 8.

The Secretary-General has the honour to circulate to the Council and the Members of the League a letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq, dated November 29th, 1934. The Appendices mentioned in the letter v^ill be circulated as soon as possible. Baghdad, November 29th 1934. To the Secretary-General. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that for some time past, and particularly during the last two years, great anxiety has been caused to the Royal Iraqi Government by^ persistent disregard and violation of the Iraqi-?ersian oound- ary by official agents of the Imperial Persian Government. 2. The boundary betv/een Iraq and Persia is derived from the Treaty of Lrzerum of 1847 (Appendix l), and a Protocol signed at Constantinople on the 4th November, a.^lo, by the Grand Vizier and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Ottoman Empire and the Ambassador of Persia, on oehalf ox the two parties and by the Ambassadors of Great Britain on Russia, on behalf of tbar respective countries in the capacity of Mediating Powers. Section V of this Protocol speci ica y laid down that as soon as any part of the irontier haa oeun delimited by the Delimilation Commission to be set up in accordance T/ith Section II, that part should be n ®l 0 - 00 n °' been finally fixed and should not be open either to subsequent examination or to revision. .The delimitci the frontier on the ground provided for in oection I carried out by this Commission in the year lux--;, a containing the Protocol of 1913 and the Proceedings Commission of 1914 is attached as Appendix Ix» 3. In spite of the legal position as ^tlined above, the Imperial Persian Government have consisten y ^ and violated the boundary so established. A summary of the more flagrant acts of aggression, with copie, ^ relevant correspondence, is attached (Appendix aq2 . will 'be seen from this correspondence, the Imperial Persian Government attempt to Justify their conduct on the ground that they do not recognise the validity of the 'boundary and do not consider themselves bound by the arrangements by which it is determined. This view the Royal Iraqi Government are unable to accept. 4. The Royal Iraqi Government has hitherto been loth to formulate publicly a complaint against a neighbour and fellow-member of the League of Nations. It has left nothing undone in its endeavour to settle the matters at issue direct with the Imperial Persian Government. As will be seen from the Government, the number conciliatory proposals which it has made, whether for the investigation by Joint commissions of particular problems affected by the precise alignment of the boundary, or for the general examination of all causes of inconvenience to either side arising from that alignment, with a view to eliminating the inconveniences by appropriate administrative arrangements, have been consistently rejected or ignored. 5. The continuance of the state of affairs described in the preceding paragraphs cannot fail to disturb the good understanding between Iraq and Persia which Iraq so earnestly desires. With great regret, therefore, the Royal Iraqi Government sees no alternative but to bring the circumstances to the attention of the Council under Article 11, para.2 of the Covenant. 6. I have the honour, accordingly, to request that you will be so good as to cause this matter to be placed on the agenda for consideration bjr the Council at its next session. 7.

It may perhaps be convenient to re-define these three hypotheses in some- what different terms. Each hypothesis is considered, on the assumption that Iraq would be our ally in accordance with the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (Annex I) , and that Persia would be neutral. The possibility that Persia would be our ally, or that, in consequence of the Covenant and the pact of Paris, the rights and obligations of neutrality would not be applicable in her case, has been left out of account. 2. The first hypothesis is that the whole of the Shatt- el-Arab, including the Hookah Channel *and the whole of the navigable channel off Mohammerah, are in Iraqi national » or territorial waters. 3- In that” event no legal difficulty would arise as to the passage of British warships and war material through the Shatt in time of war, because Iraq v/ould be our ally and would be bound to grant us all necessary facilities. 4* Whether in the same event there v/ould be any diffi- culty in the way of British warships taking in supplies of oil fuel off Abadan is a different question. Even though) f. / -2- the v/arships were lying in Iraqi waters s they could only he refuelled from Ahadan in accordance with the rules of neutrality (Articles 19 and 20 of the thirteenth Hague Convention would apparently he applicable); while if they were actually in a Persian port or roadstead 5 ..articles 12 and 15 of the Convention would also apply. Sucn difficulties could he met hy the transfer of the necessary oil supplies from Ahadan to storage tanks in Iraqi territory s whence British ships could refuel without restriction. The general principle v/ould he that Ahadan should not he used in such a way as to turn it into a belligerent base. Apart* however * from questions of neutrality* Persian goodwill woulu be essential* for the Persians are in an extremely strong position to enforce whatever measures they thinu fit on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Ahadan* since not only are the stores at Ahadan wholly within Persian territory arm subject therefore to Persian control* hut the Anglo-persian Oil Company are entirely dependent on Persian goodwill for the successf ul conduct of their busineso. Ij- ti-^n Persian Government wished to make difficulties they could, provided that such measures v/ere applicable to all the belligerents, impose regulations at Abadan v-mien uignt nwe it most difficult for British vessels lying off that pi to obtain fuel direct, even if those vessels were anchored wholly in Iraqi water, or they might prohibit the export of oil to Iraq for storage there. 5. It is also important to realise tnat* even ix clearly established that the whole of the Shatt waterway were in Iraqi national or territorial waters, and that British . t i \r f'pp-c to utilise i u warships and war material were le&amp;al y to the maximum extent in time oi war* Persia \ioul' be physically able* without any formal departure from neutrality* to exercise a dangerous amount over the passage of ships up the waterway, and even tothreaten their safety 9 e.g. ? hy allowing mines (ostensibly placed to protect her own ports or waters from a violation of her neutrality) to float into the Shatt from the Karim^ so that from the purely military point of view the Shatt unless vei\ ; . efficiently swept and policed might become a precarious means of communication. 6* The second hypothesis is that 3 while the whole of the Shatt waterway* and the navigable channel off Mohammerah are within Iraqi national or territorial waters* Persian sovereignty (i. e. * Persian territorial oi* national walorsj is proved to extend right across the dredged channel Known as the Hookah Channel* which constitutes the only approach to the Shatt for deep-draught vessels coming from Lae open sea. 7. In this event the legal power of the Persians to prevent the passage of Britisa warships woux-c the as that which would exist if Persian sovereignty over any other pert of the navigable channel or the Shatu through which it would be necessary lor British vmr^nipo to pass on their way to and from Basra or any other purely Iraqi port* and the situation would be similar to tnat discussed in connection with uho thii d hypoth^si ( paragraph 9 below) &lt;• But apart Iro— ■-'hi-? remembered that if Persian sovereignty ext endec acros Hookah Channel at any point* it would, also oe legale open to the Persians to prevent the necessax j dx o Channel being carried out* so that tne ability of British warships to use the channel would in x ac o j-n cm,; depend entirely upon Persian goodwill* 8. Before proceeding to consider the next nypotuesis* a word should perhaps be said regarding the positi Mohammerah. At this point Persia* nn^ar tme - / frontier settlement* possesses rights which appear* for a )-— —— distance of about two miles ? to bring the waters of the Shaft waterway from the Persian shore to the m edium filium aq^ag within Persian territorial, or more probably national, waters. It has been stated that the navigable channel lies wholly within Iraqi water - i.e. , on the Iraqi side of the inedium fi lium aquae - along the whole of this stretch 01 tne waterway It should be remembered, however, that the navigable channel, has been known to change its course very considerably, ana that it is reported to be extremely narrow and to require constant dredging. This being so, the possibility navigable channel eventually falling partly or wholly under Persian sovereignty in this stretch of the waterway cannot be excluded, and this would create a position similar to that dealt with in paragraphs 7 above and 9 onwards oelow. 9. The third hypothetical situation uo be that which would arise if the proposal tentatively put forward by the Foreign Office in Paper No. M. B. (C) adopted, i.e. , if an arrangement were concluded by which Iraq should cede to Persia, from tne point ,/n^ro the Iraqi frontier joins the waterway on the north down open sea on the South, part of the Shatt-ei-Arab waterway up to the thalweg , the new frontier lin^s t_- shifting of the thalweg , and the whole arrangement being strictly conditional on the conclusion of a satisfactory agreement regarding the joint conservancy of the Shaft and freedom of navigation on certain co^di^ion^ 10. This arrangement would mean that Persian n.uional o n _ -hv-ip. thalweg along the territorial waters would extend ap - - - -5 + -so q t ore sent wholly whole of the Shaft waterway, &gt; n-_ a + 1 . th „ t p erslan sovereignty would also oe Iraqi waters but tnat x- e^ oi • _ .; n the Hookah Channel, restricted to the thalweg lm ^ ' t -his would still allow British It might conceivably be that t* ,. pr . and down the Shaft war vessels to pass in time g± * - ^ i , r.ollv within Iraqi water, and through the Rookah ehannol - 4 - d*- 5 - Whether this were possible or not would depend on the width of the navigable channel on either side of its deepest course. It seems probable ? however * that the deep channel would be too narrow to allow this to happen, so that vessels using the channel would be compelled to pass through Persian waters. In that case such rights and obligations as Persia might possess under the law of neutrality or otherwise would be applicable notwithstanding that the ships might only partially be within Persian waters. 11. Failing any provisions to the contrary in the pro posed conservancy and navigation agreements, the Persian position in time of war would in these circumstances be governed by the general lav/ of neutrality, under wxixch, according to the viev/s of the Foreign Office legal adviser^ Persia would be entit l ed to exclude belligerent i-w-ssols of war both from her territorial and her national v^tero* It will 'be remembered that during the war Holland refused to allow belligerent warships to pass either up the Scheldt or through her territorial waters &gt; and it would ,_er ua.&lt;.nl,/ -o ^ be safe to assume that Persia would not be in a position to do the same thing. The case of the Scheldt ou-ioius somewhat close parallel to that of the Shatt, since at the time when it was closed Antwerp was still in Belgian hanas, and the Schell therefore afforded the only means of access for British warships to an allied port. 12. In order to remove these possible dilficultieto it would be necessary that the conservancy and ^ ree rio ' V Regime, such as the Foreign Office proposed as an essential condition of the grant of the thalweg^ irontxe-i to ^ersia, should provide specifically for the ii ex pasoc^e, of war as in time of peace, of warships on t^eir fi&amp;y Persian or Iraqi ports. Considerations neuticdity would no doubt render it impossiole to confine th' privilege to the warships of Persia and Iraq or of theirallies. Tout in practice this should not present difficulties since the passage of hostile warships could no doubt he prevented by other means. The question which arises is therefore hot/ far it would he compatible with the obligation of a neutral under the ordinary rules of international law, for Persia to subscribe to such an international arrangement So far as territorial waters go there is no doubt that although a neutral may be entitled to refuse passage, he is, subject to the rules about hovering, abuse of asylum, etc. , in no way bound to do so. Hence the agreement would not be in conflict with neutrality as regards such waters. As regards national waters, however, (wnich constitute the really important question, since it seems clear that the waters of the Shatt, above the porno where it takes the form of a river, must be regarded as national and not territorial waters) it is stated by Oppenheim (4 th edition. Volume II, paragraph 325 (a)) as follows:- 'It is believed that as a general rule a neutral state may not grant, and a belligerent state h^s right to demand, passage for belligerent v\arohips in time of war upon its rivers, of whatever kind they may be* Rivers, whether ’national’, 'boundary ? ’multi-national’ or ’international iorm po--ts the territory of the riparian state or sucres passage upon such portions of them as Delon 0 neutral states must be denied to the warships oi the belligerents in time of war, but it is possible that the provisions of a treaty of a sufficiently general and law-making kind might modify thio -ule But the Foreign Office Legal Advisers are disposed to diink that (despite the precedent of the Scheldt quoted . * -p•v' j ect in i tseli , snoula not ibove) this passage, even n oeri -i 4- v, o q V- VitB X* ^ iXQ. X Ox 1 i )e regarded as applicable to 4ne o Of access to a sea-port, such waters afford the only meanas Basra ? and that no breach of Persian neutrality would be involved by allowing belligerent warships to proceed thither through the national waters* even if there were no international agreement providing for free passage of warships in time of war. Neutrals are entitled to admit belligerent warships for a limited time and subject to certain conditions to their own ports 3 and this right ought not to be affected by the fact that the snip had to traverse national waters to reacn tne port* If so* it would seem that the situation should be the same where the port is in foreign territory, and though this is not so certain, the case would be strengthened if the right of paE ,age resulted from an international treaty which laid it down as a general privilege in favour of the ships of all nations; the Straits Convention of Lausanne may perhaps be regarded as affording a precedent. If so* it would seem that an agreement such as that contemplated would not involve any breach of Persian neutrality. 13. Generally speaking,therefore, the position seems to be that if the perso-lraqi frontier line were shifted to the thalwe g any difficulties that might result f* g,.^ the ordinary position under international law lor the pa^oa^e of British warships and war material up and down the .-.ho-tt in time of war, Iraq being an ally and Persia a neutral, could be satisfactorily removed if Persia could be induced to agree to the insertion of appropriate provisions in the instrument between Persia and Iraq by which the new boundary was laid down.

My telegram No. 205 (of November 28 - Perso-Iraqi Frontier Maps). Although numerous copies of sheets IX to XVI of Carte S upplement aire, which were printed in London, are available here, only very few copies of Sheets I to VIII, XVII and XVIII, which were printed in India, are available. In fact after giving three complete sets to Iraqi Legation, we have only just enough sets for our own use. We will, however, ascertain whether further copies of sheets I to VIII, XVII and XVIII are available in India* 2. Position regarding Carte Identique is complicated. Original Carte Identique is on scale of 1:73,050 and in 14 sheets. It was prepared at St. Petersburg!! in 1867-1869 from materials collected in 1849-1853 and is in fact described as the 'work of British and Russian officers in 1849-1855' , , the dates u ] r 867-1869 n , though quoted in Article II of Annex (A) to the 1913 Protocol, appearing nowhere upon the map itself. We have a single copy ox this map in its original form. 3. Ten sets of photographic copies of this map were, however made in 1912 and used by the 1914 commission. The line of tho frontier was dram upon each copy in red ink and all 14 sheets of each set were signed by the commission. Three of these signed copies are in possession of His Majesty s Government, one being in the Foreign Office, one at Tehran and one at His Majesty’s Mibassy in Turkey. 4.4. It should be noted that only 9 out of the 14 sheets are included in list on page 143 of Proceedings of 1914 comnission. This is because the line of the frontier on the last five (i»e. the northern) sheets is completely covered by sheets of the Carte Supplementaire, so that reference to these sheets of the Carte Identique is not required. In the case of the first nine sheets, on the other hand, the Carte Identique is in many areas (notably Shatt-el-Arab) the only authority. In any case last five sheets cover present Perso-Turkish frontier. 5. It should also be noted, in order to avoid confusion, that while sheets of Carte Identique were originally numbered from north to south, 1914 Commission re-numbered them from south to north. It is to re-numbered sheets that list on page 148 of roccedings refers. 6. The Foreign Office copies of the Carte Identique in its )riginal form (paragraph 2) and photographed form (paragraph 5) can if necessary be produced at C-eneva ior inspection only. 7. The reduced Carte Identique was originally prepared by Jrdinance Survey in 1875 in nine sheets and on sco-le of - miles the inch, and re-printed in 1912. 1^ roes noc reproduce all letails of the true Carte Identique am is noc xefeired to in Protocol or mentioned in the list of maps on page 1P3 of the Proceedings of the Commission.

Reconnaissance by the Royal Air Force shows that information given to me by Minister for Foreign Affairs is in some minor respects inaccurate. There is no Iraqi police post at point XXXIV and the rival Iraqi and Persian police posts are situated about 8 miles north of Zorbathia and 3 miles within Iraqi frontier. Both posts are of recent and temporary nature at distance of 300 yards. Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, as was to be expected, pleaded orders from the Shah. He also declined Muri’s suggestion of a joint commission of enquiry. Nuri, very sensibly I think, made a further concession and proposed the following alternatives for settlement, either maintain both police posts in statu quo pending report by a, Persian commission which the Iraqi Government did not of course bind themselves to accept or withdraw both posts and consider the incident closed. Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs said he would, support these proposals at Tehran.

Minister for Foreign Affairs has-' drawn my urgent attention to following case of breach, of Iraqi frontier by Persians and to possibility of serious complications. During the last fortnight Persians have established a police post on southern side of gap in hills one and a half miles ea^t south east of last E in 'Source Sulpureuse' (sic.). Iraqis have a police post on northern side of this gap and also at boundary ^ post Tim . Iraqi Legation at Tehran have so far failed to induce Persians to withdraw their police post which apparently trespasses 5 miles into Iraqi territory and commands entrance to the plains. Huri Said is also informed that Persians have sent 200 or 500 police reinforcements to Mansourabad whicn is off the map and some ten miles north east of point JQOI- He fears that Persians may attempt to xorce both Iraqi t jO_ico He has proposed to the Persians that the Iiaqi post at point imy and Persian post on the gap in the hills be withdrawn pending settlement by joint commission on the question wnetnci the Persians have in fact infringed the frontier. In Shah's attitude towards Iraqi-Persian frontier he doubts whether this proposal will be accepted. In2 0 3C*&gt; In order to avoid unnecessary alarm he has not yet called full meeting of Iraqi cabinet to consider the matter but is in touch with Minister of Defence and Minister of Interior. The Prime Minister was for resisting any Persian attack but Puri Said has at present advised that in case of attack the police post at point XZXT7 should withdraw and that the other Iraqi police post in the gap in the hills should not resist unless there was certainty of successful defence. In view of treaty of alliance Minister for Foreign Affairs desires to inform His Majesty's G-overnment of this act of encroachment and to ascertain your views on the matter. I have in the meantime informed Puri Said that his proposal for settling the question of localisation of Persian police post by mutual withdrawal of posts and joint commission seemed very generous as a glance at the map will show that the Persians have encroached about 5 miles on 1915-1914 frontier. I also added that i was sure you 'would approve of his advice to the Prime Minister to avoid resistance by force. Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs is now in Bagdad but Puri Said feels he will obtain little satisfaction from him as he will plead orders from the Shah. Air Officer Commanding informed.

So long as the navigable channel m t, is paro of the waterway is wholly on the Iraqi side of the this may perhaps not lead to serious difficulty, even in time of war; but the navigable channel has in the oa-t course, and it would therefore be unwise to assume that Iraq can be assured in the present situation ox peimanent over the navigable waterway at tills point. ,w, oMM , Air Council are also no doubt aware, considerable uncerta Phe Secretary ^ of the Air Ministry.rtoaUion talent 'both saier ana easier vara Persian co-cmeri? t iun to ba ©ooured* 6 . f i f ao score iary or State observe a that the Air Oi^ioer Co ending xearo t vat if tha thalweg frontier vara conceded end tae Shatt-ei-Arab vara aubaaquently to ahift its course to# tor exa.:nlt 9 the Khor Abdullaht a difficult situation might erlaa aa a result of the consequent shifting of t as frontier line* Sir ?oha 3 loon, is advised, however, that in oases of t *ls hind t .o frontier Una would regain unaltered even if t c river ^arhing it ware to change Its course.

(No. 662.) ’ / gj r Fofeign Office, September 25, 1934. ’ WITH reference to your despatch No. 540 of the 11th September regarding Perso-Iraqi relations, I have to inform you that Nuri Pasha-es-Said arrived in London on the 17th September and left again on the 20th September. I was myself absent at Balmoral during this time, but his Excellency had interviews with Sir Robert Vansittart and Mr. Rendel. 2. The object of Nuri Pasha’s visit was, as had been anticipated, to repeat the request of the Iraqi Government for the advice of His Majesty’s Government as to the desirability of appealing to the League of Nations against the refusal of Persia to recognise the validity of the frontier laid down by the International Commission in the years 1913-14.' He said that he was strongly inclined to lodge forthwith an appeal with the Council of the League under paragraph 2 oi article 11 of the Covenant. The specific grounds of complaint would be three in number and refer to the provocative activities of the Persian Government on the frontier; {a) the establishment of numerous police posts on Iraqi territory; (b) the disregard shown by Persian warships in the Shatt-el-Arab for the regu lations of the Port of Basra Administration with consequent danger to other shipping and much prejudice to Iraq’s interests; and {c) the vexatious cutting off of supplies of water on which villages, especially m the Lhaniqm area, depended for their maintenance. So soon as the appeal had ee T 0 &amp; e ’ before it was heard (the first possible date was the January session of the Council), he would offer the Persian Government a settlement on the lines P^posed and provisionally accepted by them in 1932, i.e., the Conservancy oar i ’ by which Persia would acquire a degree of control m the S hat Cel-Arab.

With regard to the danger of the Rooka Channel being allotted to Persia, Nun said that he had always contemplated the eventual conclusion of a conservancy convention, which would cover all points such as this.. i + t 5. The alternative course of postponing an appeal to the League until Nuri Pasha had accepted the Persian Government’s invitation to go to Tehran was also considered. Nuri was, however, reluctant to adopt this course, as he feared that the only result might be to make the Shah entrench himself more firmly on the frontier'question and take up a position from which it would be difficult for him to retreat with dignity, even after a League pronouncement. Moreover, he feared that if he made his offer of the contention and of the oil royalty pooling scheme before appealing to the League, and the Persian Government rejected it, he would be without any material for a compromise once the appeal had been in cldc 6. In a final interview, Sir Robert Vansittart told Nuri Pasha that he thoroughly agreed with his reasons for not going to Tehran, especially as it was really for the Persians, who were the suppliants in this case, to go to Bagdad. But he suggested that the best course might be for the Iraqi Government, without actually going to the League, to show the strength of their hand by making it plain that they were if necessary prepared to do so. Having thus called the Persian bluff they would, as an act of grace, offer the Conservancy Board and the royalty pooling arrangement. Then, if the Persians were still recalcitrant, they would reconsider the possibility of appealing to the League. 7. Nuri Pasha, who promised to think carefully over this advice, undertook a decision. 8. During his visit Nuri Pasha asked whether His Majesty’s Government attached importance to his waiting to see the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was expected in London on about the 24th September. Nuri had already made his plans to leave, but would cancel them if His Majesty’s Government thought it necessary. He was informed that there seemed to be no need for him to do this. I am, &amp;c.

Sir, Gulhek, August 25, 1934. AS reported in my telegram N o. 113 o f to-day’s date, the Shah received me yesterday evening in order that I might present to His Majesty Air Vice- Marshal C. S. Burnett, who has come here on a short holiday from Bagdad. I had told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he was coming, and had asked whether or not the Shah would wish to see him. 2. After some general discussion on the value of aircraft, especially from the angle of internal security, in the course of which the Air Vice-Marshal remarked appropriately on the progress made since he was in Persia fourteen years ago, the Shah told us that he intended to ask for the services of a British air mission to control the workshops which were being erected, and to train Persian mechanics. His intention was eventually to build aeroplanes in Persia. The Air Vice-Marshal told him that no air force could live without efficient repair shops; they were the first essential, and when they were working well actual construction could be considered. 3. Details of this part of the conversation will be reported by Air Vice- Marshal Burnett to the Air Ministry. 4. I then said that I had read with great interest the accounts of His Majesty’s visit to Turkey. He replied that he had been determined to put an end to the century-old friction between the two countries, and it was his intention to establish good relations with all countries with which Persia was in contact, not only with her great neighbours, but also with her small, and especially with Iraq. There were difficulties, and it was inadmissible that the Persian sloops should be interfered with when passing through the Shatt-el-Arab up to Mohammera.h. (I do not know what these “ incidents ” are unless His Majesty had been given a distorted version of the narrowly-averted collisions mentioned in my despatch No. 13 of the 8th January, 1934.) Fie regarded the Iraqis as his brothers, and would always do so, even if their attitude was unfriendly and showed a disregard of Persia’s rights. He hoped that British influence would be exerted to promote a settlement. 5. I replied that the matter was outside my province; moreover, Iraq was an independent State and a member of the League of Nations.. 6. The Shah refused to be impressed by this, and said something wnic rather suggested that perhaps His Majesty’s Government were not aveise o a perpetuation of differences between Persia and Iraq. . . 7. I asked him to believe that this was not at all the case, and s ^ lcl 17 ia a practical solution of any difficulties which might exist in the bhatt-ei-Arab coma be found by the constitution of the conservancy board which had been suggestea. 8. The Shah let the conversation drop, and shortly after he concluded the audience, after assuring the Air Vice-Marshal that he had been S a him and would welcome future visits. While we were standing an ', leave, he once again told the Air Vice-Marshal that Ira T 1 \ ware b ot ™ h and that he wished him to tell the Iraq Government that he a sai Air Vice-Marshal promised to convey this personally to King - azl - f 9. His Majesty then turned to me and said that he quite 1'ked dip ornate but liked soldiers rather more (a little suggestive of a housemaid, but that is ho Kazerni translated), and we made our bow Si and departed vice . Marshalj and 10. I am sure that the Shah was delighted to see he publicly evinced his pleasure in a large dinner party f Foreign Affairs last night. I think that a visit by him o - a useful annual institution, in that it would afford the incumbent of this post an [215 k—21extra opportunity—opportunities being rare—of seeing the Shah and learning what at the moment he has in mind, or perhaps what he wishes us to think is on his mind. 11. I will conclude this despatch by reporting two apparently trivial facts • The Chief of Staff and Acting Minister of War was unashamedly terrified when I suggested that the Air Vice-Marshal should pay him a call; his namesake, who commands the air force, declined, after a sensible interval, an invitation to dine at the Legation on the day before yesterday, on the plea that he had received forty-eight hours’ leave as from the morning of that day. He attended last night’s banquet and told me that he had had twenty-four hours’ leave. Fear will soon be the only factor that counts at Tehran. 12. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and to His Majesty’s Chargd d’Affaires at Bagdad (No. 64). I have, &amp;c. (For the Minister), V. A. L.

Surely this is wrong. Even if having regard to the Treaty of Brzerum any intimation at all is necessary, simple notification is all that the Iraqi Govei’nment should require# *ie don f t f^ant to make the position in the Shatt worse than it is, or to suggest to the Persians that they should go back on their regulations recently issued, which provide that notification is sufficient when two or less ships are visiting# I am sending copies of this letter to Laithw&amp;ite and Pirie.

On the question of the Persian-Iraq frontier along Shatt El Aral I consider from Service point of view there are strong ohjections to the Foreign Office proposals* It appears to me essential that Iraq should maintain as at present complete sovereign rights along Shatt El Arab as any division of these rights would give rise to complica tions in the operation of flying hosts and presumably also in the movement of H. M. Ships. The Shatt is the main passage for supplies and war-like stores to us in Iraq. Air Ministry letter S. 25594/Part 3/S.6 dated December 8th, 1931 is an accurate statement of tne case from the point of view and needs no further amplifi° 2. Although political side of the question is not my concern I venture to put forward the following points.- (a) Under Ports Directorate supervision, Iraq alone, after great expenditure of work and money has made navigable as it is today. (b) The question of preventing cutting of the bank of the Shatt at Bidya Bend by flood water is surely the responsibility of Iraq, despite the fact that flood n-f the frontier water comes from Karun River on Persian ' ^ I was informed by Colonel Ward before he l-ft I r 1 ^ u-T-Qf future dredging England where he is now on leave, or •«- - t “' 4 T Tf prevention which is now on order arrivco in I q ,l of the breaking of the south bank of the Shatt is not an engineering possibility and Shatt breaks through to2- Abdullah, and if Thalweg frontier has been accei new frontier in time to come will presumably fo; stream. Difficulties may then arise with regard to' proprietary rights of date gardens which now belong to Iraq and Koweit. From Persian point of view it might be to their interest to allow Shatt to break through to Khor Abdullah as they will still have a navigable channel, to their port of Muhammarah via Bahmanshir as soon as work on this has been completed which I understand presents no great practical difficulties. Even if a conservancy board is accepted under present Persian regime the Persian members may well prove obstructive should any difference of opinion arise. 3. If my points are correct it would appear that Iraq has nothing to gain by agreeing to the Thalweg frontier, and can be little worse off if the matter goes to the League and a decision is given against her. 4. I have shown this telegram, to Ogilvie Forbes and he has agreed generally with points which I have raised, observed however that some misunderstanding appears to have 1 ? J arisen over Thalweg as opposed to medium Filium Aquae a matter upon which he has commented in his despatch to Foreign Office No. 540 of September 11th, paragraph 5B.

The question of perso-Iraqi frontier along the Shatt-el-Arah is under active- discussion here with a view to deciding what advice shall he given to Iraqi Government for purposes of discussion with Persia. 2. Advice so far given has been that Iraq should stand on 1913/14 protocol and delimitation* which legal advisers consider valid in law* hut Foreign Office now state:- (a) In absence of Persian co-operation waters of Karim flow into Shatt entirely uncontrolled and in flood time bring down large quantities of mud which threatens to silt up main navigable channel below Mc-hammerah. (b) The flood water itself is cutting away sonic bank: of Shatt at big bend above Abadan and Colonel Ward is understood to have said unere is risk: of Shatt breaking through possibly to Khor Abdullah 5 which might make Shatt entirely unnavigable, and in that event would cut oif port of B as rail from sea.. (c) That Persia could deflect waters ox Karon uom Bahmanshir * thus creating an all Persian channel from which Mohammerah could be approached iron- 4 - (d) That contrary to previous advice on subject Persia could now probably claim thalv/eg frontier i or a few miles above and below Mohammerah also that whole or most of Hookah channel might be claimed to lie^ within Persian territory. Tn light of these considerations Foreign Office are now disposed^ subject to comments of other Department to recommend that Iraq should recede from the position previously taken up and agree to thalweg frontier with Persia as far as Shaft is concerned^ strictly subject to the condition however that Persia accepts conservancy board. They fear that if Persia takes question to League ultimate result to British interests might be less favourable. 4. The technical and legal aspects referred to in (a) to (d) above are being considered further before conclusion on political aspect is reached. In the mean time, please signal urgently any further information you may have on those points together with your views generally on Foreign Office proposal.

(Paper No. M.E.(O) 144). THE CHAIRMAN explained that the meeting had been called in order to discuss the best line to be taken in the forth coming discussions with Nuri Pasha, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, who had just arrived in London. Kazemi, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs was also expected to be in London in the near future and Nuri Pasha had suggested that it might be possible for them to come to some understanding while they were both in London. This might afford an opportunity for His Majesty’s Government to use their influence to obtain a solution of this problem which might be satisfactory not only to Iraq and Persia but also to British interests. In paragraph 9 of their memorandum (Paper No. M.E.(O) 142) the Foreign Office had tentatively suggested the following line of action. That Iraq should be advised to offer Persia the thalweg frontier in the Shatt from where the Persian frontier reached it to the open sea at the mouth of the Rookah Channel, but only in return for (a) immediate Persian acceptance of tiie Conservancy Board Convention, as already drafted and provisionally agreed upon, and (b) the recognition by Persia of the validity of the whole of the rest of the land frontier. The Foreign Gif icefelt that the present situation indeed dangerous, ought not to , which was unsatisfactory and De allowed to continue indefi nitely » ihe solution suggested by then involved a definite auhU 2 in_mi 2 &gt; i.e., the acceptance of the Conservancy Board and the recognition of the rest of the land frontier. During a brief visit which he had paid to Iraq in 1932 his special atten tion had been drawn by Sir Francis Humphrys to the unsatisfactory position on the ^hatt—el—Arab, and he had been taken all over the area by Colonel Ward, the Basra Port Director. It appeared that unless steps were taken to set up some joint control for the whole system of waterways, including the Karun and the Bahmanshir, there was a possibility that the main channel would become un- navigable, either by silting up below Mohammerah or by breaking its south bank at the big bend just above Abadan and being diverted to the Khor Abdullah or other channels. Colonel Ward’s constant activity had ensured that the navigable channel was kept open for sea-going vessels in spite of Persian non-co-operation and obstruction. But Colonel Ward had laid great stress on the necessity of setting up some form of joint control in the very near future, if the risk of the Shatt becoming unnavigable was to be avoided. It might therefore be well worth while making some concession in order to achieve the establishment of the proposed Conservancy Board. CAPTAIN KING stated that the Admiralty had not had time to examine the position in detail and were consequently not yet able to express their concurrence with the line of action suggested by the Foreign Office. It would be necessary to consult the Hydrographic and other departments and obtain their views. He suggested that an interdepartmental discussion might clear the practical and technical aspects of the situation, particularly if an expert like Colonel Ward could be px^oent. He was doubtful whether it would be practicable for the Persians to divert the waters of the Karun down the Bahmanshir channel, and whether the main waterway in the Shatt was really likely to- 3 - '/ 'be rendered unnavigable. THE CHAIRMAN stated that Colonel Ward was at present in England and he undertook to invite him to attend any meeting other departments might desire. It might also he advisable for the Air Ministry to ask the Air Officer Commanding for a special report on this question. He had been informed by Mr. Elkington, the Manager of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Abadan, that a continuous flow of fresh water down the Bahmanshir channel would be of real advantage to A.badan. This was one of the points which would be dealt with by a Conservancy Board. GROUP CAPTAIN McCLAUGHRY agreed to ask for the views of the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, on the subject. MR. BAGGALLAY, who had recently come from Tehran, stated that the Persians were believed to have prepared pl^-o j-or dredging the Bahmanshir Channel so as to make Mohammeran accessible from the sea by a waterway lying entirely in Persian territory. CAPTAIN BRA.NDON stated that the Board ef Trade were onl;y concerned in this question as affecting shipping to B.dsrc Abadan. He said that he had had no experience of the Shatt- el-Arab for some ten years. He had, however, at tno - time, heard the fear expressed that Abadan might b~ left h' 0 dry owing to a change in the coarse of the stream, knowledge of any suggestion of the main stream breaking through its banks to the Khor Abdullah, but only that it might make a Tv-i Vi t q vi sw n sc nemo lor new channel cutting out Abadan. -n xv 4 - -for 1 qpa-soing vessels would rendering the Bahmanshir Channel fit . tt„ -fiiilv agreed that Colonel be a very big undertaking. He ^ui y b -&gt; 4-v.ot the Air Ministry Ward should be consulted and agreed the might also be able to give valuable informatio u . i i! !(It was agreed that the Foreign Office should arrange, as soon as possible, for Colonel Ward to raeet the technical representatives of the Admiralty, Air Ministry and Board of Trade. THE CriAlKM^H stated tiiat it was also necessary to con sider the political aspect of the question. Should the Iraqis adhere to their refusal to compromise on the existing boundaries it was probable that one party would appeal to the League. In the view of the legal advisers to the Foreign Office there was no doubt as to the legal validity of the 1013/1914 frontier delimitation. But even if this were established there were certain points where it might not prove v/holly favourable to Iraq. The Delimitation Commission had ? for example 9 defined the south end of the frontier as coming from the open sea and striking the east bank of the Shatt at a point approximately opposite to Fao. If the Iraqis took their stand on the agreement, this de limitation must be accepted. But since 1913, 'when this Wcj.s drawn up, new hanks had formed and it might now be found that Persian Sovereignty extended across the sole practicuore channel, known as the Hookah Channel. This point was considered in 1929, when the view of the legal experts was that Peisia might- we 'll obtain the whole of the Hookah Channel it the c^se went arbitration. In this event a very awkward situation mig well develop. Persia would be able, for instance to interfere with the necessary dredging operations, fuoreove , Persians already had control of the waterway up to midstream, opposite Mohammerah, at the junction of the narun, wmdi was . + ^ m n concede to them the thalweg one of the most important points. x , , , , therefore, not necessarily greatly alter at other places would, thoreioi'-, the situation. A further point was that while the only access to the sea, the Persians not only had fl-ny other ports, but were also actively developing an all- Persian deep water harbour at Bundar bhahpurMu! »d ? which would render them independent of the use of the Shatt. The Persians were in a position, hy obstruction and non-co-operation not only in the Shatt itself but - what was even more important - in regard to the waters of the Karun and the dredging of the Hookah Channel, to render the Shatt practically unnavigable. They would not hesitate to sacrifice Abadan and even Mohammerah if a first-class row developed with Iraq over the Shatt, and would be able to oblige the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to transfer their port to Bundar Shahpur. In such an event both Abadan and Basra might become inaccessible to sea-going vessels, and we should be far worse off if we had to get our oil from an all-Persian port at Khor Musa than if Persia had the thalweg frontier at Abadan and agreed to co-operate in the maintenance of the Shatt waterway. The Foreign Office were therefore inclined to take the view that it would be to the best interest of Ir^v ;1 and His Majesty’s Government to press now, while the oppoi tuni j still existed, for a settlement which would ensure the maintenance of the Shatt waterway in return for a concession which was fact largely illusory. CAPTAIN BRANDON said that the maintenance of the Hookah Channel for sea-going vessels was very desirable. Hc aosuned that in peace-time the proposed Conservancy Board responsible for its upkeep, while the situation in ' regards the use and control of this passage was the Defence Departments MR. SEAL pointed out that the arrangement propooed oy the Foreign Office would increase the power for mischi^i of the _ + nnipss we were to Persian Government rather than decrees &gt; assume that the gift of half the Shatt-el-Arah v,ould miracle of making the Persians reasonable and easy neighbours.THS CHAIRMAN considered that a comprehensive settle ment on the lines suggested by the Foreign Office might be accepted by the Persians. It might also still be accepted by tie Iraqis if they could be made to realise its advantages. He did not think that the Iraqis would all be opposed to the idea. Indeed., the Iraqi Minister in London had recently said to him that he thought the Persian desire for the thalweg frontier was vpry natural., since the present frontier was quite anomalous, and Persian resentment at it was hardly to be wondered at. There was the further danger in putting off a settlement much longer, that Persia and Iraq might get together and come to some agreement behind our backs, by which we should be left worse off than ever. MR. SEAL observed that the present frontier was not so unreasonable as might at first appear, since the Shatt-el-Arab was the only outlet of Iraq to the sea, whereas Persia had plenty of ports in the Gulf. &gt; THE CHAIRMAN thought that friction was more likely to become increasingly serious if the present situation were allov/ea to continue. If the Persian desiderata were met and a general bargain struck, he believed that Iraq would probably gain on the balance. He was fully alive to the importance of ensuring that the Conservancy Board should be of a more or less permanent character and possess effective control. He thought this point could, however, he provided for in the settlement. posoibly of the Danube might afford some kind of precedent o 4 . ^ +&gt; 00 + thp Danube Commission was CAPTAIN BRANDON understood that uhe ma practically bankrupt, and, consequently, not a very good example. He thought it possible that once the Persian claim to tne thalweg had been acknowledged the Persians would gradually let the Conservancy Board lapse. - 4 . • iqdq Rortain concessions, on a CAPTAIN KING said tnat m 192a cer He asked whethei Her scale, opposite Abadan had been s: ' d - 7 - these would not oe sufficient concession to Persia GROUP CAPTAIN McCLAUGHRY stated that what were thought to he generous gt-stuies to Persia in the past have not produced any very satisfactory results 9 and the Air Ministry therefore did not wi sh to make any concession to the Persians, except in return for some definite advantage. it would he necessary to ensure that the passage hy water of troops and stores to Basra in the event of emergency was net liable to Persian interference, and it was important that nothing diould he done which would he likely to complicate the operation of flying boats. CAPTAIN KING pointed out that a number of questions were involved, such as, for example, that of the Persians laying mines In their waters. MR. BAGGALLAY understood that the Anglo-persian Oil Company would probably not mind very much if they had to transfer to Bundar Shahpur from Abadan Reach, as deep water facilities existed in the former port, and a railway to the interior was under construetion. MR. SEAL suggested that it would always be open to H.m. Government, as owners of a controlling interest in the Anglo- Persian Oil Company, to veto a move to Bundar Shahpur on poliuical grounds. He asked whether the Shah insisted on such a ,no\e under the concession. He considered that if ^h- e Peroian u-cAern ment had the power to force the Anglo-Persian Oil Company uo move to Bundar Shahpur, they could wreck the finances of an t y Conserva* Board which could be established. This possibility was therefore strictly speaking irrelevant to the issue, unle^o shown that the concession in the Shatt would wean the Shah from his pet scheme at Bundar Shahpur, which seemed on Yhe face highly improbable. THE CHAIRMAN said that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had already ?/orked out plans to move their shippi^e.Bundar Shahpur. It was quite possible that the Persians might offer the Company some financial inducements to transfer. It would be extremely difiicult for H.M. Government to prevent the Company from transferring their port to Bundar Shahpur 9 if they wivshed to do so for economic reasons. The subject had already been discussed more than once with the Company., and they had always contemplated the possibility of having to move to Bundar Shahpur in certain eventualities. The possibility of our e/entually becoming dependent on a purely Persian port for our oil supplies in the event of the situation further deteriorating in the Shaft therefore could not be ignored. CAPTAIN KING said that the Admiralty did not rule out the solution proposed by the Foreign Office. They however wished for further time to consider the matter. THE CHAIRMAN thought that it was most important that a Conservancy Board should be established at an early date. Colonel Ward was q he understood, about to retire Should he do so the position would be most difficulty as he would probably be replaced by an Iraqi with whom the Persians would not co-operate. If a Conservancy Board were formed^ some qualified expert - probably a British subject - would be appointed, who would serve the interests of both Iraq and Persia. He under stood that the danger to the channel of the Shatt-el-Arab was almost entirely due to the flood waters of the Karun, which came down from Persia. The Persians, on the one hand, might deflect, the waters of that river to the Bahmanshir and thus render the Shatt-el-Arab too shallow for navigation, or they might fail to regulate its flood waters which would lead to even more damage either by silting up or by erosion of the South bank. -,/hile He agreed that the Persians would probably prefer to bo.ve the three ports of Moiiammerah, Abadan and Bundar Shahpur, Persian mentality was such that they might easil;/ sacrifice thutwo in order to satisfy their own am our propre e GROUP CAPTAIN McCLAUGIIRY said that he v/as not satisfied that in present cj-roumstances the Persian Government could make any ohstruction which we could not overcome 0 The Air Ministry would therefore like to reserve their opinion until after the meeting with Colonel War do He also wished to ascertain what the position would he in war as regards the transport of troops and stores to Basra should the Persian claim up to the thalweg of the Shatt he re cognised» THE CHAIRMAN pointed out that as the Persians already had the midstream frontier at Mohammerah 9 and possibly complete control of the Hookah Channel 5 under the existing arrangements 9 the acquisition by them of the thalweg along the rest of the stream would hardly make the situation much worse 3 while it would at any rate mean that Iraq would hold up to the thalweg in the Hookah Channel» Meanwhile he had been authorised by Sir John Simon to put forward officially the suggestions for the solution contained in Foreign Office memorandum (Paper No« M«Eo (0) ) ° J - i - Lo matter had indeed become one of some urgency ? and he *iohed again to emphasise the possible dangers o 1 a delay* Botn Nuri pasha and Kazemi would, be in London thio month. Ii thi--, afforded an opportunity of having a friendly diouus^ien arriving at some agreement 9 such an opportunity ought not be missedo Otherwise it was possible that Iraq and Persia might get together and come to some independent agreement 9 which might be to our detriment. It was better 9 ther^forej use our influence to obtain some solution which v,oul There was also the danger of lurkish our interests*mediation, which had heen offered on this question. It ?/as unlikely that British interests would Benefit hy such intervention. HR. SEAL said that the Admiralty would not wish the League of Rations to get a footing in the Shatt-el-AraB, If the river Became an international waterway the right of navigation By Belligerent warships might Be imperilled. THE CHAIRMAN thought that if the to international or foreign mediation matter were left entirely it was improBaBle that the eventual solution would Be as Government as that now in conuempl doubtful whether it would in fact under the Conservancy Board, favourable to His Majesty f s ation, since it was very allow for British representation MAJOR OSBORNE said that the War Office were in general agreement with the Admiralty and Air Ministry. He suggested that it might he possible to make use of the clause m the Iraq. Treaty regarding the maintenance of Imperial communications, as an argument for the Iraqis to press for cntish representa on the Board.

Ihe attached memorandum is circulated to the Members of the Sub-Commit tee at the request of the Foreign Office. E 5719/197/54. The Iraqi Government have recently asked for the advice of His Majesty’s Government in regard to their relations with Persia, and more particularly as to the line which they should pursue towards the Persian refusal to recognise the present Perso-Iraqi frontier. They have been told that in the opinion of His Majesty's Government the Iraqi Government have a sound legal case for maintaining the legal validity of the present frontier, i. e. the binding character of the frontier protocol and delimitation of 1915/1914, which established the frontier between Persia and the Ottoman Empire. His Majesty's Government have not yet reached any decision, however,/2 . however* as to v/hether to advise the Iraqi Government to press for (or accept) a reference of this question to the League of Nations. 2. Nuri Pasha, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, is expected to come to London for five days on September 17th, and may well wish to discuss this question. His present plan is, after his return to Iraq at the end of September, to go to Tehran in order to discuss the matter personally with the Persian Government. He may well, hpwbver, ask the advice of His Majesty's Government as to the line which he should pursue at Tehran in certain eventualities, and it therefore seems desirable to consider without further delay the question of what policy it would be best for Iraq to pursue, and of what advice, if any, it would be best for His Majesty’s Government to give to Nuri Pasha if he raises the matter. 5. The position as regards the present frontier is that it seems quite clear that the Protocol and delimitation o^. 1913/14 are legally binding and valid, and that their legal validity would be upheld by the League or by any internauional tribunal. This would not, however, necessarily ^olve ^he problem. In the Shatt-el~Arab, which is the portion of the frontier of most concern to His Majesty s Government, th frontier is defined as following the low-water maik on Persian bank, with, however, two important exceptions, and below Mohammerah the frontier laid down by the Pro might well be interpreted as giving Persia the Thalweg or midstream/5 ./ 3. midstream line for some miles, and there is at least one point in this neighbourhood where in certain years the deep-water channel is very narrow and runs close to the Iraqi bank. Secondly, the southern end of the frontier in trie Shatt is not satisfactorily defined either in the Protocol or in the map drawn up by the delimitation commission, and it seems probable that the most correct interpretation of the Protocol and the map would now give to Persia an important part and possibly even the whole of the present dredged channel (known as the Hookah Channel) at the mouth of the Shatt. As it has been established that no other channel could be opened up in place of it, this would in effect give Persia a great measure of control over the entire waterway. 4. It is probable that if the question were referred to the League the matter could not end with a mere pronounce ment by the League as to the validity of the 1913 frontier, but would be carried a stage further and that the League would be asked to define the frontier at these doubtful points. This might end by crystallising the position in the Shatt in the unsatisfactory manner indicated above. lior can the possibility be altogether excluded of fne League, in view of the very anomalous character of the frontier, and of the changed conditions since it was laid dorvn, sugge^ some compromise which would be by no means to the inteiort Of Iraq or of His Majesty's Government. A reierence 01 ihe question to the League is therefore by no means free irom risk.5* On tun other nand &amp; continiiEnee of the present situation appears to he open to even graver risks. The Persians intensely dislike the present frontier in the Shatt - which is certainly an extremely strange one - and have for many years been pressing for its modification. The Shah is committed to this policy; and it is quite clear that unless something can he done to meet the Persian grievances in this area* Iraq will have to face continued hostility and obstruc tion from Persia in all matters connected with the waterway. It was largely with a view to meeting these Persian grievances that His Majesty’s Government suggested some years ago the conclusion of a Conservancy Board Convention which would have given Persia a share in the control of the waters oh the Shatt. The Persians have, however, made it abundantly clear that they will not contemplate the conclusion of such a Con vention in the absence of any kind of modification of the frontier. All our Information both from Tehran and from Bagdad, shows in fact that in present conditions and circum stances there is no hope whatever of getting a Conservancy Board Convention through. 6. Meanwhile the situation in the Shatt itself is becoming increasingly difficult and dangerous. In tne ao^ence of all Persian co-operaticn, the waters of the Karun flow into the Shatt entirely uncontrolled, and in flood time oring down large quantities of mud which threatens to silc up the main navigable channel below Mohammerah, while the flood itself is cutting away the south bank of the ohatb ^t die bi^ bend/bend above Abadan. Colonel Ward considers that this involves n real risk of the Shatt breaking through to the Khor Abdullah vdiich would of course make the Shatt itself entirely un-navigable and would cut off the Port of Basra from the sea. It is only the personality and prestige of Colonel Ward, and his constant activity and close supervision of the waterway which has ensured that the navigable channel is kept open for deep-draft ships in spite of Persian non-co-operation and obstruction. But it is probable that Colonel Ward will retire within the next year or two; and unless some satisfactory system for international co operation in the control of the waters of the Shatt, and the Karun, and the Bahmanshir is devised and brought into lorce, it may well be that the waterway will become quite unnavigable. 7. This would be a much greater disaster for Iraq than for Persia. The Persians, apart from iiaving many other harbours, are rapidly developing the new deep-water port of .mor Lu^a, which they have already threatened to force the Anglo Persian Oil Company to use instead of Abadan. It would not even be nece^ai,, for them to sacrifice Moharnmerah (though the kian would ±x)t hesitate to do so), as they could probably deflect the waters of the Karun down the Bahmanshir, and thus create a new all- Persian channel by which Mohammerah could be approacned east. The Persians are therefore at present in a position produce by non-co-operation and obstruction, a situati large vessels would no longer be able to approach Eas , a result of which the Shatt, if it remained navi 0 Abl would become navigable by very shallow crait only. 8. Hitherto His Majesty’s Government have advised the Iraqi Governmentmmm 6 , Government firmly to oppose all Persian suggestions for frontier rectification in the Shatt. But in view of the circumstance! outlined above, it seems doubtful whether this advice is any longer in the best interest either of Iraq or of His Majesty's Government themselves. The question therefore arises whether an alternative policy would not now be preferable, and it has teen suggested that a satisfactory solution might possibly be reached on the following lines. 9. Iraq would offer Persia the thalweg frontier in the Shatt from where the Persian frontier reached it to the open sea at the mouth of the Hookah Channel, but only in return for (a) immediate Persian acceptance of the Conservancy Board Convention as already drafted and provisionally agreed upon, and (b) the recognition by Persia of the validity of the whole oi tne rest of the land frontier. It would probably also be necessary to make some arrangement regarding royalties on oil from the 11 transferred territories 15 , and for joint frontier control ^ ri Kurdish districts, but these are secondary points which do not affect the main issue. 10. A more important point would be to ensure that the Conservancy Board Convention, which would be the main guid pro ipio for frontier rectification in the Shatt, should not of a purely temporary nature while the frontier rectification was in Perpetuity. This point could perhaps be met ember oy giving tie Conservancy Board Convention a very l° n E ai ^ ! ® careful provision for its renewal, possibly with any necessary Modifications; or by providing that the frontier itself snoula oc reconsidered, or referred to some outside uody fox xevie.., event7. event of the Conservancy Board arrangements coming to an end„ 11. It is suggested that an arrangement on these lines would be to the best interest of Iraq as well as to the best interest of His Majesty ! s Government, since, unless some com promise of this kind is reached, the situation in the chatu icsclf nay well become impossible, Iraq may be deprived of her oimy port and His Majesty’s Government may be deprived of access cp a place of great strategic importance where bkep naze imp^- -ant military commitments. It is realised however, Hiat ohe y..qeooaa. is full of difficulties, and that the tactical question c.&lt; if it is approved, it should be suggested to the Iraqis, almost equally complicated.STAN DING- OF FICI AL SUB-COM^ITTES FOR QUESTIONS OQNCEREIEG TEOTmIDDLF FAST. 0 The attached memoranda are circulated in connection -with the meeting of the Sub-Committee to be held on Monday the 17th instant 9 at 3 C 15 porno M 2 9 Whitehall Gardens 9 S.W.1 3 15th September 9 1934,PERSO-IRAQI RELATIONS. Note by Mr. Rendel. Mr, Strang told me over the telephone this morning from Geneva, in the course of a conversation on another subject, that he had learnt that Nuri Pasha had recently had a discussion with Kazemi, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the question of Perso-Iraqi frontier etc. Kazemi had apparently again pressed for frontier rectification in the Shatt-el-Arab as a preliminary condition to any kind of agreement. Nuri had repeated the usual Iraqi answer that this was quite out of the question. He had then asked Kazemi on what arguments the Persians based their refusal to recognise the 1913 frontier. Kazemi had then, to his surprise, instead of putting forward the usual argument about non- ratification by the Mejlis, produced an entirely new and very remarkable theory that Persia could not recognise an agreement which had been concluded with a State which no longer existed, i.e., the former Ottoman Empire. 2. Nuri had then asked Kazemi whether Persia proposed to bring the question of the Perso-Iraqi frontier before the League. Kazemi had said that they did not contemplate doing this, but that chey mi 0 ht appeal to “some other international tribunal such the Permanent Court of International Justice. To my enquiry as to how this could be done except under the Optional Clause, which does not appear to apply, Mr, Strang said that he was as much in th^ was. He had gathered, however, that the Persians were seriously ...seriously contemplating invoking the mediation of Turkey and that Nuri was less averse to this idea than he had teen, as he had now apparently formed the impression that Tewfik Hustu was more sympathetic to the Iraqi case than he had previously thought* 3 e Mr, Strang then told me that there was talk of Kaserai coming to London next week. Nuri is in any case arriving here about the 17th and had suggested that if Kazemi came also the whole of this Perso-Iraqi question could perhaps he dealt with and settled here, presumably under the aegis of His Majesty’s Government* In that event Nuri would be prepared to postpone his departure from London for Bagdad, which he had provisionally fixed for September 22nd. 4. I said that we should be glad to see Nuri as soon as he arrived, and to learn what had passed between him and the Persians, and if necessary to give him an;y advice we could; but I wan careful not to commio His Majesty’s Government to any kind oi intervenuion* 5. It would of course be satisfactory if ohis tiresome question could be settled in the near future by some general agreement between the Iraqis and the Persians under our auspices, particularly if tme alternative were to be mediation by Tuikey which do not want* On the other hand I find it difficult to believe that Kazemi would have enough authority to conclude any kind of definite agreement except in where the matter could be personally dealt uith y Shah* (Signed) 0.

Uuri would be much surprised if Persians were to take to Court guestion on which he thinks Iraq has a strong legal case and he is wondering whether he ought not to bring Persians before tae League on the score of their own acts of usurpation in respect of frontier. fnri told Mr. Strang tnis morning that he had since asked Tewfik Rushdi Bey wnether Turkish Government regarded Treaty of Erzeroum as still valid. Tewfik Rushdi Bey replied in the affirmative. Nuri has the impression that Tewfik is moving on the side of Iraq on the question of Iraqi-Persian frontier. Nuri gathers from Kazemi that latter is shortly going to London and he wonders whether it might he possible for him to settle frontier question with Kazemi when they are both in London.; 5845/58/34) !9l/38/34) .13 MaITj. .opies by baf; BRITISH JsSaB tSSY, BAGB D. lltlx September, 1934. Sir, &lt;iith refei-enoe to my despatch No«540 of todays date, I buve the honour to inform you that I have been furnished, after some delay, with a copy of a note which the late Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed to the Persian Minister on August 14th last, enclosing a memorandum on the subject of Perso-Iraoi relations. 2. In this note Tawfiq a! Suwaidi made no mention of the Conservancy Board. He commenced by drawing attention to the fact that, in answer to their numerous representations regarding Persian acts of aggression and frontier violation, tne Iraqi Government had either received no replies at all or else the unacceptable reply that the Persian Govemraent did not recognize the frontier as delimited in 1914; he then reiterated the view of the Irani Government that the frontier as delimited in 1914 was definite and binding; ana, finally, he called upon the Persian Government to take steps to s sttle the various matters which had been the subject of representations by the Ira^i Government, so that the various draft Perso-lraqi agreements could be negotiated and proper neighbourly relations established 3. There is nothing new in the attitude adopted by the late Minister for Foreign Affairs in his note, which is lengthy and far from concise, and I have therefore not thought it necessary to supply you with a translation. I should, however. Eight Honourable /bring Sir John Simon, G.C.3.I. f K.C./.J., etc., etc,, etc.sli brin^r to your notice one unfortunate error which occurs in it and which may give the Persians an opportunity to sidetrack the main issue. Tawfiq a! Suwaidi states in his note that effect has bean given by Turkey and Persia to the Protocol of ,1913 so far as the present Turco- Persian frontier is concerned* This is, of course, incorrect since in the Turco-Persian frontier agreement of 1932 mention of the protocol of 1913 and of the delimitation Commission of 1914 was studiously avoided and the frontier as delimited in 1914 was considerably altered in three zones. In this connexion I would refer you to Sir Reginald Eoare's despatch No. 302 of the 1st July. 1932. i'rom Angora despatch No. 166 of the 16th April. 1929, it would appear that, in the negotiations leading up to this agreement, the Persian Covemment endeavoured to induce the Turkish Government to recognise the 1913 Protocol, _bui fall*?- to do so® 4.

S 76, dated 16th January, 1934, addressed to the Persian Legation in Baghdad, to which this Ministry has not received an answer. Peralan ships still ente?

This Ministry wishes to draw attention to the repeated communications addressed to the Persian Legation on this subject, and in particular to Memoranda Nos 0 4?5?| 3721° 5404j S4?0| dated 21st July, 1932; 3rd May and 13th June, 1933; 9th April, 1934 0 No action has been taken to set things aright, and it is only in the ease of Memorandum No 0 3721, that a reply has been received. In this Memorandum aentiosn was made of the entry of Persian customs officials into docks on Iraqi territory, and the reply stated that the docks mentioned were the property of the Persian Government, and not of Iraq. This, however, is totally incorrect, as these docks belong to Iraq, and have no ties with Persia whatsoever.

WITH reference to Sir Francis Humphrys’s despatch No. 246 of the 3rd May, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of a letter which he received shortly before his departure from the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the subject of relations between Iraq and Persia and the present position on their common frontier. 2. The enclosures to Dr. Damluji’s letter provide a useful summary of the grievances of the Iraqi Government against the Persian authorities, and show clearly how the alleged activities of the Auromani Kurds on Iraqi soil, which formed the subject of Sir Francis Humphrys’s despatch No. 264 of the 10th May, are but one of the many questions which are at present in open dispute between the two countries. But the acrimonious tone which was developing in the diplomatic exchanges between the Iraqi and Persian Governments has recently shown signs of abating, and at an interview between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Persian Minister on the 14th May, which was arranged at the latter’s special request, Samii Khan adopted a much more conciliatory attitude, and asked to be enlightened on the Iraqi counter-charges against the Persian Government. In particular, he requested details of the accusation that the Persian frontier authorities were conniving at the armed incursions of Persian tribesmen into Iraq. He also expressed concern at the attacks levelled at Persia in the Chamber of Deputies on account of the cutting of the Mandali water supply and the construction of Persian police posts in Iraqi territory, an suggested that they were calculated to rouse public opinion in Ii a_q. . 3. This afforded Dr. Damluji an opportunity to state the Iraqi complaints against Persia in these matters (his Excellency did not touch upon the Shatt-ei- Arab on this occasion), and to reaffirm the adherence of ^ to the frontier laid down by the Demarcation I rotocol o j n o n Minister expressed himself as grateful for these explanations, an a ^ ® personal exertions to remove the causes of friction between e w _ , He stated that the Persian Government were ready to use al , m ^ ns armed raids by their tribes into Iraq, and added that e wmi p ^ , their attention to the Iraqi complaint that the Persian author ties re f ^^^ grant the extradition of refugees who had committe cr no ^intention Khan assured Dr Damluji that the Persian Government had no mtentio whatsoever ^f violating^raqi territory, and that if proof of such violation were given they would be prepared to remove the cause of offence as g^me tlmeTersia done in 1931 in the case of a police post near Rljani m. j t p e Mandali could not recognise the Frontier Demarcation p 10 ?

It is firmly believed by the Iraqi aurum connivance of the Persian frontier officials. [131 1—6] B2 o. u A member of my staff recently asked the British Adviser in the Iraqi Ministry for Foreign Affairs for his opinion on the present Persian diplomatic offensive against Iraq. Mr. Edmonds replied that he did not regard the Persian t£ bombardment ” very seriously. He maintained that the bubble of Persian bombast could easily be pricked by any Iraqi negotiator who resisted the temptation to follow the Persian lead into a bog of vague generalisations. The. Persians could always be silenced by a challenge to substantiate, geographically their stories of raids and rebellions directed from Iraqi territory by pointing out the exact location of Persian posts in indisputably Iraqi territory, and by indicating the precise manner in which the water supply of the Iraqi frontier towns and villages was being diverted out of pure spite. Unfortunately, however, there exist few Iraqi officials who could marshal their facts, and who understand the superiority in an argument of a concrete fact over an abstract generalisation. Mr. Edmonds added, however, that the Persian efforts to seduce the Iraqi frontier tribes from their allegiance was a serious aspect of the situation. It appears that the Persian policy (compare the Persian Minister’s note of the 30th April, which forms the last enclosure to Dr. Damluji’s letter of the 10th May) is to bring the most extravagant accusations against tribal leaders on the Iraqi side of the frontier, and to goad the Iraqi Government, by menaces, into arresting and otherwise molesting numbers of their own subjects who have committed no crime in Iraq. These persons do not realise that the Persian Government is at the bottom of their misfortunes, and when they are released or escape from an Iraqi prison they are thoroughly disaffected against the Iraqi Government. The Persian frontier authorities then cause them to be informed that they will be welcomed on Persian soil, granted a full amnesty, if necessary, for their misdeeds on Persian soil, and given material assistance to found a new home. Mr. Edmonds believes that this policy has met with some success, and that at the present time a part of the population on the Iraqi side of the frontier are disaffected against the Government and look upon Persia as their friend. 6. The visit of the Iraqi Director-General of Police to the north-eastern part of the Iraqi frontier (reported in paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 264 of the 10th May on the Auroman situation) resulted in a recommendation that fourteen new police posts should be immediately established on the frontier in the sector between a point north of the town of Suleimanieh and a point east of Halabja. This plan is doubtless the one for a better frontier patrol to which Dr. Damluji refers m the fourth paragraph of his letter of the 10th May. .

' ■W Persian Government concerning the Turkish-Iraqi-Persian Frontier Delimitation Protocol of 1913 and the V roces-verbaux of the meetings held by the International I wish to explain to your Excellency that the Persian Government, who have on various occasions declared that they do not recognise the protocol in question, continue to act in a manner which confirms their policy in this connexion. With a view to enabling you to obtain an idea of the nature of Persian (acts of) aggression, I enclose a copy of my letter dated the 18th April, 1934, addressed to the secretariat of the Oouncil of Ministers. In addition, we have been receiving from the Persian Legation communications making unwarranted imputations against Iraqi officials and denying the efforts exerted by the Iraqi authorities in the interests of the Persian Government. The communications of the Legation have lately assumed an increasingly vehement tone, and the Iraqi Government have been accused of assisting bandits and of planning aggression in Persian territory. Your Excellency will plainly see from a letter which I have addressed to the secretariat of the Council of Ministers, dated the 3rd May, 1934 (of which a copy is enclosed, together with a copy of the enclosure thereto^ 1 ) namely, a letter from the Persian Minister, Bagdad), the extent of the suspicions entertained by the Persian Government and the object they seek by the multiplication of complaints notwithstanding the efforts made, and which continue to be made, by the Iraqi Government to assist the Persian Government by the despatch of army and police forces for the pursuit of Persian bands and the arrest of criminals; while, on the other hand, the Persian Government continue to procrastinate over compliance with the trifling demands of Iraq and attempt to disturb peace on the borders of Iraq. A point which I wish to explain to your Excellency is that the policy of the Persian Government and the spirit which they bear towards Iraq have not weakened the resolution of the Iraqi Government to fulfil the obligations of neighbourly and other relations existing between the two countries. On more than one occasion we wrote to the Persian Legation drawing their attention to the delay on the part of the Persian Government in the fulfilment of the demands of Iraq, pointing out the acts committed by the Persian authorities on the borders (of Iraq), contradicting all rumours that had reached them as to the intentions of the Iraqi Government and assuring them of the goodwill of Iraq towards Persia.. I should also explain to your Excellency that the Iraqi Government have adopted all possible measures for the strengthening of the administration and police posts in the frontier zone with a view to closing the frontier m the face o Persian bands and to affording no opportunity for the violation of the laqi frontier My obieot in writing this letter is to acquaint your Excellency with the nature of the policy of the Persian Government in order that you may be so good as to bring it to the notice of His Britannic Majesty s Govei nmen .

B 2protests which were based on the status quo as established by the Delimitation Protocol While this Ministry have already forwarded to you copies of consider able correspondence concerning Persian acts of aggression on the frontiers of Iraq, we nevertheless deem it advisable to give the following summary of cases of this nature for easy reference and in order to give an idea of the situation, which will help in deciding the policy to be adopted towards the Persian Government. 1. Basra: Shatt-el-Arab. According to the Delimitation Protocol the whole of the Shatt-el-Arab falls within the frontiers of Iraq, Persia being left only Abadan, the four islands lying between Shutait and Mawiyah, and two islands situated off the village of Maniuhi, all of which form dependencies of Abadan. Persia has, however, ignored the protocol and has been exercising sovereignty in the Shatt as follows (a) Persian war vessels enter within the Iraq frontier, paying no heed to port instructions and regulations. In the course of conversations with the Port Director, Basra, the Officer Commanding Persian War Vessels in the Shatt-el-Arab and also the Persian consul, Basra, declared that the Persian Government did not recognise the said regulations and instructions, nor did they recognise the existing frontier of the Iraqi Government’s ownership of the Shatt-el-Arab as at present. (b) Persian motor launches with “ amniyah ” (police) and customs officers on board enter the Shatt-el-Arab and arrest Iraqi subjects; while Persian soldiers fire on Iraqi and other owners of motor launches plying in the Shatt-el-Arab, on the pretext that they are engaged in smuggling or have violated the frontiers of Persia. We have on numerous occasions invited the Persian Government’s attention to the contraventions committed by their vessels in the Shatt-el-Arab and to the risks involved by the continued commission of such acts, and we have forwarded to them copies of the port instructions. The last communication on the subject of contraventions by Persian war vessels was our note, dated the 15th January, 1934, addressed to the Persian Legation, Bagdad, of which a copy is enclosed herewith^ 1 ) and to which no reply has yet been received. Contraventions by war vessels continue, as well as acts of frontier violation. 2. A marah: Posts. Persian aggression in the Amarah Liwa started in 1931, when the Persian authorities began a propaganda campaign among the Iraqi tribes. This campaign was followed by the ploughing and sowing of a section of the Sharsh lands and the murder of one Iraqi subject, and then by the construction of a motor road, the demolition of frontier pillars, and the construction of three posts within the Iraqi frontier at Sharsh, Ilwa and Bujaila, and the connexion of these posts by telephone. Prolonged correspondence having failed to produce any useful result, a commission consisting of military engineers was sent out. This commission reported on the location of these posts, having regard to the Delimitation Protocol, and m their report established the fact of the violation of Iraqi territory by the Pei sians. The last note addressed to the Persian Government on the basis of the ^ T aS which we sent you a copy with our letter dated -n e f Av 1 Apnl, 1934, and to which the Persian Government have not yet replied, ni '‘W ^!r lc k Ministry expect to receive from the Persian Government 4.1 U t^ ?• v'’ no ^ differ from their latest reply concerning non-recognition of the Delimitation Protocol. 8 —V r f kasvkj! o. Iraq is entitled to half of the waters of the Gangir in Mandali. It was tUo ° j?] 18 l 3 ^ 0 P 0 Di on ol the water supply that the Mandali gardens w( ?Q 9 e an&lt; ^ ^ at ! iac P ^cts disposed of agricultural land there. But sir ^ • ei ‘ sia started to take the greater part of these waters, leaving only a sm [■ ion o ow into Iraqi territory. Following conversations and diploma l 1 )Not printed.correspondence between the two Governments, the volume of water allowed to flow into Iraqi territory was, on occasion, actually increased, but onlv for a short time after which the water supply was cut off again. Thus the Mandali gardens and plantations have been ruined, only a very small section of them remaining. The same is the case with Zarbatiya waters. The Persians first hegan to exploit the Kunjan Cham River in 1930. Later on they constructed dams, part of which fall within the frontiers of Iraq. The Persian argument in defence of the cutting-off of the water of this river was that the water belonged to the Persians; that the latter were entitled to take all their requirements from it, and that the Iraqis might benefit by such portion as was left. Thus have the gardens and plantations of Zarbatiya been ruined. 4. Diyala Liwa. The Persians demolished frontier pillars in the west of Jabal Maimaik and constructed a post at Xi-Khidr. Following prolonged discussions with the Persian Government a body of experts was sent out by the Ministry of Defence. This body drew up a technical report, in the light of v 7 hich was drafted the note of our Legation at Tehran dated the 23rd September, 1933. After a number of reminders had been addressed to them, the Persian Government sent out their above-mentioned reply, refusing to recognise the Frontier Protocol as an instrument determining the frontier line between the two States. 5. Suleimanieh Liwob-Qadha of Halabja. The following are the more important questions at dispute :— {a) There is in the Qadha of Halabja a village called Biara-Nard, the water supply of which flows down from the Persian village of Hani-Kramlah and accumulates on the Iraqi border. The Persians claim that the locality where these waters accumulate is Persian territory, whereas it is actually Iraqi territory. Acting upon their contention, the Persians are continually violating the frontier at Biarah and breaking through the water dams, although they are unable to benefit from these waters, which only flow into the valleys uselessly. They (the Persians) have seized a plot of land in the village ot Banawa They U have prohibited the Iraqi natives of the village of Tawila passage into the woods belonging to that village and from which the villages obtain their wood. The latest information reports activities on the part of the Persians with a view to making such use of the waters of the Alwand a fll nV l0r !ties adverse effect on Khanikin; also activities on the part o e n p ar A on the in connexion with the enlistment of bandits and the distur a ■ j p borders of Suleimanieh. . , ^ • -j-tUg /U von The above is a summary of the more important frontmr mcidente^ ^ are aware, there are many subsidiary incidents arising r .ig jigsem- such as the violation of the Iraqi frontier, the distur anc P ’ £ rom ination of propaganda among Iraqi tribes, &amp;c., regar i g time to time furnished you with information. +r ,™ n ki P onrl will involve A continuance of these activities will give cause f T ° t r Z motive the Iraqi Government in considerable expenditure. oGniration to a modifi- behind this conduct of the Persian Government is P r™ ^ave alreadv cation of the frontier in conformity with I^eir owm ^ -p rontier p ro tocoi, in the past alluded to the injustice sustained by th Persia did not possess pointing out that the latter was drawn up at a time when Persia P a strong constitutional Government representative o . rece j vec | f r0 m the The following are extracts from two notes on this subject receneo Persian Legation, Bagdad :— (a) From note dated the 20th September 1931 '^^delimitethm of the Frontier Delimitation Agreement ^^“S^sed nevertheless ” frontier with Iraq has not been officially recognised, nev6 {b) From note dated the 2nd December. 1931 : £! The Imperial Persian Government do not deem the said agreement to have at any time acquired a formal character. They maintain their previous objection until such time as the question has been laid under discussion between the two States and the differences in question have been settled.” I should, however, invite attention to the fact that the frontier delimitation question was among the questions discussed in the course of the meeting between Nuri Pasha A1 Said and the Minister of Court, Teymourtache. which took place on the 30th September, 1932, when other questions relating to the conclusion of treaties and agreements with the Persian Government were discussed. On this subject Nuri Pasha said, among other things: £C I would invite the attention of the honourable Minister of Court to the necessity of avoiding any arrangement or settlement calculated to result in a modification of the existing frontier, because such arrangement or settlement would be impossible for the Iraqi Government to accept for a variety of reasons and considerations.' In a letter received by Nuri Pasha from the Minister of Court on the 3rd November, 1932 (of which a copy was sent to you with our letter dated the 12th November, 1932) the Minister of Court did not say anything to suggest non-recognition of the Frontier Delimitation Protocol. In a letter addressed by us to the Persian Minister, Bagdad, of which a copy was forwarded to you with our letter dated the 2nd May, 1933, we referred to the above understanding reached between Nuri Pasha and the Persian Minister of Court, and asked that the Persian Government should confirm their willingness to enter into negotiations on the bases over which understanding had been reached. The Persian Government have up to now rendered no reply to this letter. Hence their recent declaration signified that there was no definite frontier line separating the two countries. We have, therefore, prepared a reply( 3 ) for communication to the Persian Government through our Tehran Legation, in which we insist on our point of view concerning the protocol and the proces-verbaux of the meetings of the International Frontier Delimitation Commission, and on the fact that the frontier determined by the said protocol and described in the proces-verbaux of the meetings is final and definite, pointing out that a revision or rectification of the frontier cannot be entertained and expressing our willingness to resume negotiations concerning the treaties and agreements already discussed with the Persian Government, providing that this shall not ultimately lead to an infringe ment of the sovereign rights of Iraq in any part of her territories or territorial waters as determined by the above-mentioned delimitation. It is requested that the matter should be laid before the Council of Ministers for approval of the draft reply referred to above and the determination of the Iraqi Government s view r s as to the policy to be adopted in this connexion.

Ogilvie Forbes (Bagdad) Foreign Office, July 20th 1934. 9.45 p.m, No.135. AAAAAAAAA*l4AAAAAAAA Your telegram No. 163 (of 18tii July. Perso-Iraqi frontier). I see no objection to proposed visit or to line which Nuri Pasha proposes to take, so far as it goes. Our advice on this general question to Iraqi Minister is enclosed in my despatch No.465 (of 10th July) by bag of July 12th. It would seem well for Nuri Pasha to go to Tehran furnished - if time permits - with results of proposed detailed examination by senior administrative official of position on frontier and with comprehensive statement of Iraqi complaints and prepared, if it seemed appropriate, to press for full statement of legal grounds for Persian government’s refusal to recognise 1913/14 delimitation of frontier. For your own information, my view a snort time ago would have been that Iraqi government should aim at securing substantiation of their title to 1913/14 frontier., even dy reference to the League if need be. If this were secured, conservancy board project might then be again hand Persian invitation to Nuri Pasha immediately on conclusionconclusion of Shah«s visit to Turkey may indicate tit, he is now prepared to adopt more accommodating attitude, if so, this might obviously affect question of best tactics for Iraq to adopt. Meanwhile I m not yet in a position to authorise you definitely to advise the Iraqis to appeal to the •League if need be on the question of the frontier, althougl I am advised that their rights are unassailable and would almost certainly be maintained at Geneva. Nor is it desirable that we should tahe the responsibility of advising Nuri Pasha to begin his discussions with the Persians by a categorical assertion of his rights, only offering tne Conservancy Board project after those rights have been recognised, since it may still prove better tactics - particularly if the Persians are anxious to be friendly - to begin by pressing Conservancy Board Convention as a constructive proposal designed to mitigate Persian sense of grievance in Shatt-el-Arab and only to fall back on categorical assertion of rights if Persians Prove intractable. You should be generally guided by above in discussing matter with Nuri Pasha and Iraqi government. Despatch follows.

IN a private letter to Mr. Rendel of the 8th March, 1933 (a copy of which I sent to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran), I commented upon Persian allegations to the effect that the Auromani Kurds under the family of Jafar Sultan were receiving encouragement from the Iraqi side of the frontier in their hostilities with the Persian Government forces. 2. The Persian authorities have recently resumed their operations against the surviving members of this tribe and have effected a concentration of troops in the vicinity of the Iraqi-Persian frontier. This action appears to have broken the last resistance of the Auromanis, who have either scattered to the more inaccessible parts of the mountains or fled for safety into Iraq. I under stand that only two of the prominent Auromani leaders—Ahmed Beg (son of Jafar Sultan) and Hama Rashid—are still at large in Persia, and they are believed to be hiding somewhere on or near the frontier. 3. The stream of refugees into Iraqi territory is proving a source of some embarassment to the Iraqi Government, and detachments of police and military have been specially drafted into the Halabja area to assist the local authorities in rounding up these unwelcome visitors. The operations are under the personal command of the Director-General of Police. Fortunately the Auromanis display no hostility towards the Iraqi forces and thirty-six of them (including Tawfiq Deg, grandson of Jafar Sultan) have been arrested and interned at Sulaimamyah. is understood that the Persian Government intend to ask for their extiadition, but the Iraqi Government are disposed to treat them as political prisoners m U nr A ^ rf 11 n H AT’ HimArVlSlOn the same way as Jafar Sultan himself, who is now residing under supenision reports to be supplied to Majesty’s Embassy. 6.

Sir, With reference to my telegram No. 371 of December 12th, 1933, I have the honour to report that the Shah still apparently intends to go on his travels this spring. Rumour is stronger than ever that his real object in undertaking the journey is in order to undergo, either in Switzerland or Germany, an operation for cancer of the stomach. 2« The Turkish Ambassador told Mr. Mallet recently that he now understands that the Shah f s visit to Angora is not likely to be before the end of April. He thinks that the Shah is certainly going on to Europe for medical treatment, but there is great reticence in official and court circles and he cannot find out ^ « Excellency believed the Shah would go to that is, about the last week of April. d’Affaires, on the other hand, told Mr. Mallet that it was now rather uncertain whether the Shah was really going to Baghdad at all. He had (with some audacity.') asked now Baghdad at all. He had (with i Kazemi if the Shah was really i answer ’’No”. He had also tack who had said something about an He had also tackled one thing about an ulcer but repudiated any Mr. A1 Mudhaffer also said that there of the Shah’s doctors idea of cancer. was no progress whatever about case, etcetera, the Persians st not recognise the 1914 frontier the Persians still maintained that they did , e 1914 frontier delimitation, but they had never The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I etc. , etc. , ihn Simon, G.o.b.x.&gt; , etc., . etc., The Foreign Offic®*IM —^ 4!4 never dared say so in writing for fear that ’Iraq might appeal to the League, 3* The imminent departure of His Imperial Majesty is generating a good deal of activity with the object of ensuring peace and Quiet during his absence. The Bakhtiari and kindred arrests were Quite possibly planned in this connection, Vosuq-ed-Bowleh is said to have been ordered to take a holiday in Europe, The local Qajars are being suitably terrorised into slavish adulation of the Pahlevi regime by a series of press articles, all originally hitched on to an innocuous statement in the 'Daily Mirror' that a Qajar exiled princeling had successfully acted as Caliban in some amateur theatricals in London, in which the 'bestial satisfaction of their perverted passions' is among the lesser of the crimes attributed to those monsters in human form who for one hundred and fifty years sullied the throne of Persia and frequently indulged in the crime of political assassination - a crime, we are given to understand, which is nowadays quite unheard of* 4, None the less, many people are wondering whether the Shah will really absent himself at all, cancer or no cancer. In conversation with my Belgian colleague a few days ago, the Prime Minister left a fairly definite impression that the State visit to Baghdad had Been abandoned; if that is the case, the pretext would be presumably that the Shatt- el-Arab negotiations had made no progress, and that relations ^efficiently satisfactory to with ’Iraq were therefore not suf . 4 rt would not, I Should imagine, be unduly justify the visit.

Section 5. [E 5035/447/34] No. 1. Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon —(Received August 29.) (No. 397.) Gulhek, August 12, 1933. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt of your telegram No. 120 of the 5 th instant on the subject of Perso-Iraqi relations. 2. There is not much that I can add to what I said in my telegram No. 167 of the 8 th August. It is evident that there is a good deal of friction between the two neighbours and, while the Persians are probably the worst offenders, I am not convinced that the Iraq Government could not do more to improve relations than adopt the purely passive attitude which they seem at present to favour. In this connexion I was glad to learn from your despatch No. 258 of the 26th July last that Nouri Pasha has been urged to renew proposals to the Persian Government for the establishment of a tripartite conservancy board for the Shatt-el-Arab. Now that this question has also been broached at the Foreign Office with the Persian Charge d’Affaires, I assume that I am at liberty to mention it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, if he reverts to the subjects of the Shatt-el-Arab or lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf. 3 . The Persian press continues, doubtless under official inspiration, to complain of frontier incidents. , I have the honour to enclose summaries ( ) o two recent articles in the Ittela at. ^ o-naain 4 The Legation chauffeur tells me that there was a good deal of go p recently in the foffee-shops about the need for teaching the was that Reza Shah ought to show his strength by annexing Bagdad It was rGrfnppd that, King Feisal would not return from Europe, having loilowea i example of Ahmad® Shah? but no doubt His Majesty’s sudden return to Bagdad will have put a stop to such nonsensical talk.

Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon. — (Received September 27.) (No. 431.) Sir, Gulhek, September 7, 1933. WITH reference to your despatch No. 332 of the 10th August last, and in jy amplification of my telegram Na. 165 of the 29th August, T have the honour to ^ inform you that the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs reverted to the whole question of Persia’s claims in the Shatt-el-Arab at an interview which I had with his Highness on that date. 2 . Eeroughi is evidently much obsessed with this question, which he regards- as the main obstacle to better relations with Iraq. I do not encourage him to air his grievances about Iraq to me, but when such questions as the behaviour of the Persian navy are under discussion between us it is difficult to prevent him from turning the conversation to this topic. On this occasion I had been rehearsing the whole catalogue of misdeeds of the Persian navy in the hope of persuading him that Major Bayendor was not a fit person to be Senior Naval Officer, and I happened to mention the dangerous manner in which Persian men-of-war navigated the Shatt-el-Arab. I asked his Highness whether in this connexion he had received a report from the Persian Charge d’Affaires of the conversation mentioned in your despatch, and Eeroughi replied in the affirmative. From this he launched out into the sad story of Persia’s grievances in the Shatt-el-Arab. Everything depended upon the interpretation of article 2 of the Treaty of Erzerum, which made over the eastern bank of the Shatt-el-Arab to Persia and gave the Persians complete.liberty n f navi gating the nvem but did not state that the waters of the river were definitely to be Turkish territorial waters. On this the 1913-14 frontier settlement was drawn up, but the Persian Government had never accepted it and considered it entirely unfair to Persia. His Highness went on to declare that Persia had no desire to grab fresh territory from the young nation of Iraq. Demonstrating his argument with an ashtray which lay between us, he said : “For me to take this ashtray and say it is mine and for you to snatch it back and say ‘No, it is mine,’ would be a merely childish way to behave. We Persians are not children, and we do not wish to behave m such a manner^ What the Persian Government desired was that the Shatt-el-Arab should be declared an international waterway “like others. ,• -. h 3 . I said that I was not prepared to discuss the details of this question with his Highness, more especially as he already know our poin o J^ ew % , d He had heard from M. Nury what the Foreign Office thought of the subject as we had just been mentioning the activities of the Frenc 1 &amp; S a ^ ' was expert in the Gulf, I would 'add that our interest m the -ehA r ab was. naturally to know that the best relations existed b® ween e which and from our own point of view to be assured t a ri r ^ ua ’ n0 r i s p constituted the vast majority of the shipping !u tb e wa jjighness through neglect of dredging or inadequate lightmg and ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ course was well aware of the scheme propounded by Sir I ^ i q Feroughi of his visit here for the establishment of a tnpar i e co „ J g.

I explained to his Highness that the question was obviouaiy ^ and Iraq to negotiate between themselves Eeroughi expressed the independent and would expect to be treate • every possible way, but he greatest anxiety to respect the independence /f good offices of His hoped that when the time came he might count upon the go [915 dd—7]the Per si aii Government should discuss these recommendations with the Port of Basra authorities We had explained in an earlier note that we should niefer any discussions to take place with Colonel Ward, the head of the port adrnin^trf tion, who was at present on leave, but if there was any urgencyhjolondWald^ assistants were always present to give any information or advice required either fcy the Persian Government or the expert, and I thought it possible that the - might even be prepared to take the expert for a trip in the Nearchus if any furthel J^pection seemed necessary. J 5. Sheyesteh asked exactly what our attitude was to the latest move of the Persians : did we maintain any claim to the lights ? I replied that the lights had been erected by the Government of India in the course of years and were their property. But for all that we had no reason and no desire to object to the Persian Government carrying out any inspections they liked on their own territory, and if the Persian Government decided to administer the lighting and buoying of their own coast in future, that was a question for them alone to decide. We did, how ever, hope for co-operation, and, in fact, for the reasons I had given, thought co-operation essential in the interests of navigation. I was not concerned for the moment with the ways in which co-operation could be achieved, but only to urge that before making any changes the Persian Government should consult the Port of Basra authorities. 6 . Sheyesteh said that personally he thought our point of view entirely reasonable, and would see that it was adequately presented to the Ministry of War. He rather gave the impression that he had not studied the question much hitherto, but would now take it up seriously. At the beginning of our conversa tion he had complained of the amount of work which the charge of two Departments (he still had the European and American Sections) gave him. August 28, 1933. L.

I told his Highness that I felt sure that when the negotiations with Iraq were well under way, and if both parties desired the advice of Sir Francis Humphrys, there should be no difficulty in obtaining it. , l . 1 5 I hope that my mention of the conservancy board idea, upon which I only touched quite lightly, will not meet with your disapproval. When such subjects as the Shatt-el-Arab and the lighting and buoying m the Gulf are being discussed i i ! 4- F i F To c&lt;r&gt; n o vvr rn n n to o -t-F/^-v* ^11 ^ 1 i ’‘#Q stota ' ,s at P r ' •&lt; here it is almost impossible not to mention the scheme, which is, after all, the wholf 7 . 4- 4- r* Arx T T 11 TTT 1 II /“v 4- -A- H „ 1 pivot of our policy in these matters. As you will see from the enclosed memorandum by Mr. Baggallay of a conversation which he held with the head of the English Section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Persian Government have evidently not been giving very serious consideration lately to the details of the scheme, but they have now, I hope, received a certain stimulus from us. I realise that in speaking as I did to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I may be held to have gone somewhat beyond the instructions contained in your telegram No. 122 of the 17th August. The fact, however, that our conversation had touched upon M. Nury’s visit to Mr. Bendel made it very difficult for me to avoid all mention of the tripartite scheme. It may, in any case, be useful to have ascertained that in Feroughi’s mind the scheme is not entirely shelved. On the other hand, there is always a danger that the Ministry of War may be going ahead with a quite independent,plan without ever having heard of the conservancy board idea. I hope that they may now, as the result of Mr. Baggallay’s talk with Sheyesteh and mine with Feroughi, be apprised of the real situation and shape their policy accordingly. 6 . I am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad (No. 73), and to the Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (No. 135). I have, &amp;c. V. A. L. MALLET. Enclosure in No. 1 . Memorandum by Mr. Baggallay respecting a Conversation with the Head of the English Section of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. I SPOKE to Sheyesteh on Saturday (26th August) about the question of lights and buoys in the Persian Gulf, explaining that I wished to amplify our note of the 23rd August, which he had just received. 2 . I said that the Foreign Office and other Departments had thought it rather discourteous of the Persian Government to have gone ahead with the inspection of the lights on the Persian coast (and, what was worse, on Tamb) without waiting - or a reply to the request for guidance to be extended to their newly-engaged expert by the Port of Basra authorities. We had admittedly taken two months to reply, but there was nothing in the original request to indicate that the matter was at all urgent, and in any case the Persian Government had never told us who the expert was. 3. Sheyesteh said that he had passed on to the Ministry of War our enquiry as to the expert s identity, but the latter had replied that as it was only a question o inspecting lights on Persian territory, the matter was a purely internal one w iwT aS sca T cel y ne cessary to “trouble ’’ the Legation with the expert’s name: e o i agreed that this was a strange reply in view of the previous request for assis ance. Sheyesteh said he would gladly tell me who the expert was if he knew mmseit, but he didn’t; he only knew he was a Frenchman. I said it was no • U f lnesS i° ( 3urs ’ but it might be worth ascertaining whether the expert was quite m epen en oi the representative of some construction company, whose main object would be contracts. Sheyesteh thought this a great idea. -f tJlen &amp; ot 011 fo the main issue.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 7th June, 1933. Dear Starling, With reference to our official letter No. E 1850/1039/34 of the 29th April, I send you herewith a copy of a semi-official letter from our Embassy at Bagdad on the subject of the draft recently put forward by the Persian Minister at Bagaad for an agreement relating to the exploitation of the oilfields in the H Transferred Territories” on the Perso-Iraqi frontier near Khaniqin. 2. We propose, when replying to the Embassy, to tell them that the situation has now been radically altered * by the provisions of article 9 of the new Anglo-Persian Oil Companj^ concession. 3. At the same time we do not feel at all convinced by the arguments adduced by the Bagdad Chancery in support of the action of the Iraqis in turning down the Persian proposals out of hand. Of course, the fact that it is the Anglo-Persian Oil Company who will be working the oil on both sides of the frontier may well provide the practical solution of the question. But even so it might I suppose pay the company to develop the field on one side oi th frontier at the expense of the field on the other (since the royalty and refining arrangements differ) and it seems possible that the Irakis might one day find it to their advantage to conclude with the Persians an arrangement more or less on the lines of the reacted draft 'accord' as ■•C. Starling Esq. L * v fk I’WnT'A**. “S f *»• J if k'445 as we interpret it: viz, an arrangement proceeds of such oilfields as He acros: both countries. tor sharing the the frontier in Before replying to the Chancery, I should grateful if you could let me have your views on the whole guestion. In particular, it would he interesting to know whether it is true, as the Persian press has freguently complained of late, that oil is at present being drained off from under .Persian soil by wells situated in the Transferred lerritories on the Iraqi side of the frontier; and vvnether the configuration of the oil-hearing strata lying athwart the frontier night he such as to permit the Persians, at some future date, to reverse the process and drain off oil from the Iraqi side. It seems to us that if either country were to increase its own royalties in this way at the expense of the other, the latter would have a legitimate grievance and a moral right to press for the conclusion of some agreement for the regulation of the exploitation of the frontier fields or the sharing of the profits. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) G.f. RENDEL.446 PJ' 2687/1039/34). P/7/33). BBITISH EMBASSY, BAGDAD. 11th May, 1933. Dear Department, Many thanks for your letter No. E/1850/l039/34o of the 27th April. 2. We are sorry that we cannot agree with your view that the Persian draft Accord regarding the Transferred Territories Oilfield is an ’’attempt to reach an under standing regarding the fair exploitation of any oilfields which may lie athwart the existing frontier in the neighbour hood of KhaniQ.in. ” 3. Article 1 of the draft seems to us to define quite clearly the zone covered ky the Persian proposals as being the territory situated between the existing irentier between Persia and ’Iraq and the old frontier between Persia and the Ottoman Empire prior to the demarcation of 1913-14. That is to say a zone which is entirely within ’Iraqi territory. There is nothing in this article to bring into the scope of the Accord that pai t of the oilfield which lies on the Persian side of the 1913-14 frontier line. 4. The provisions of Article 2 are similarly restricted to the special zone and make no reference to any geological study of that part of the oilfield which is situated m Persian territory. 5. Article 3, it is true, does contain a va^ie reference to the action to he taken in regard to strata of petroleum lying within the territory of hotn countries, hut in face of the specific limitation, in other Articles, of the zone covered hy the Accord, to ’Xraai territory, it Eastern Department, Foreign Office.it would be PiBky (especially in dealing with the Persians) to attribute to the Persian Sovernment the intention which you suggest. 6 . we should also like to draw your attention to Article 4 and to the serious difficulties to which it might give rise with the ’Iraq Petroleum Company if it were discovered that some of the oil hearing strate of the ’special zone’ (defined in Article l) were found to extend heyond that ^one into the area now covered hy the ’Iraq petroleum Company’s concession from the ’Iraqi Government. 7. We feel that the provisions of Article 5 are unjustifiable as a permanent arrangement without complete reciprocity inregard to the exploitation of the oilfield on the Persian side and we fear that it would he dangerous to accept these provisions even as a provisional arrangement since many years might elapse before full agreement on all the other points could he reached and in the meanwhile Persia would be enjoying half the profits of an oilfield over which we hold that the 'Iragi Government has complete sovereignty and exclusive rights. 8 . In view of the last sentence above it is perhaps unnecessary to add that we consider that the provisions of Article 6 are quite gratuitous. 9. Our idea of an equitable settlement of the problem is that the oilfield on both sides of the existing frontier in the Khaniqin area should, if this is technically . -i - nr.it the profits being feasible, he worked as a sing , Q iri a proportion corresponding shared hy both Governments m a I f the field lying in © ach country, to the proportion of theWe gather that this is your idea too hut we regret that we cannot share your view that this is what is intended hy the Persian draft sent with our despatch No. 203 of 27th April. 10 . The Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed the Ambassador that he has told the Persian Minister at Bagdad tha u he cannot discuss an agreement on the basis of this draft and has reminded him of the discussions which he had with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in Tehran last year when agreement in principle was reached for a settlement on the basis outlined in paragraph 9 above (see Hoare’s telegram to the High Commissioner ITo. 31 of the 29th April, 1932, copy to the Foreign Office}. 11 o ¥e are sending a copy of this letter and of the Ambassador’s letter of 6 th April to Rendel to Tehran. Yours ever, CHANCERY./OPY/DM. P.D.357/1 r P. o c o o 450 PETROLEUM DEPARTMENT. 17th June, 1933. I ^ Dear Rendel, C*.?i In reply to your letter of' June 7th, regarding the draft recently put forward by the Persian Minister at Bagdad for an agreement relating to the development of the oil-fields in the 'Transferred Territories' and the Perso-Iraqi frontier, I agree that the situation has been substantially changed by the provisions of Article 9 of the new Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession. This provides that the Company shall immediately make arrangements to proceed with its operations in the province of Kermanshah with a view to producing and refining petroleum there. We had in fact deferred comment on your official letter of April 29th until we saw what the new concession contained in this’’respect. I think we may find that with this new provision the Persian Government will lose some of their interest in the draft 'Accord'. As regards the Transferred Territories, the Agreement of August 30th, 1925, with the Iraq Government, provides that the Company siiall continue energetically to exploit the resources of the Transferred Territories, and will proceed without undue delay ^to erect a refinery. This has already been erected. A further Agreement of 24th May, 1926, provides that the royalty shall for the first 20 years after the completion of a pipe-line for export shipment be 4/- (gold) per ton. Royalty to the Persian Government under the new Agreement is also iixed at 4/- per ton bu-t is payable in sterling. In both the Transferred Territories and Persia there are therefore obligations to work and to erec a refinery but in present circumstances it would be cheaper purely M a royalty point of view to work the Persian oil. I have studied the draft •'Accord' enclosed with Humphrys’ despatch of March 29th, and I agree with Humphrys that it appears to represent an aTTEelpt on the part of the Persians to secure a^ share in the proceeds of the oil in the whole o:t , t „ h i P Territories, which now properly belong to Iraq witnout suitable compensating advantages to Iraq. In vour paragraph 4, you refer to complaints in the Persian press that oil is at present being dr ^ f ' r ^ 0 ^er.

The most modern practice in new fields is to space wells too far apart in the first instance and then gradually close them in until the minimum distance has been obtained. In the new field at Haft Kel in Persia the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are starting with wells three miles apart. In the old Persian field wells are now spaced at a distance of about 1 mile apart. Article 2 of the draft '’Accord” would require the Anglo- Persian Oil Company to undertake a geological survey over the whole of the Transferred Territories and it is then assumed in Article 5 that it would be practicable to reach a conclusion which would enable some arrangement to be made. In the first place I do not consider, for the reasons given in the previous paragraph, that a geological survey could settle the point at issue, and secondly, I do not think there is any justification for the whole of the Transferred Territories being brought into any such scheme. There may conceivably be a case for some royalty sharing scheme in respect of a narrow strip of territory of perhaps about a mile wide on either side of the irontier (assuming that wells are put down close to the frontier), but it does not seem to me that there is any urgency over this and the matter could very we3.1 stand over until a good deal more drilling has been done and the extent of the oil-fields more accurately defined.

You will observe that the Persian Government propose that the territory situated 'between the actual frontier and the former frontier between Persia and the ottoman Empire should be constituted into a special zone for the purpose of exploiting the petroleum deposits known to exist there, and that eueh exploitation should he carried out in common between the two Governments, who would share the profits derived therefiom. 4. Soon after the receipt of this document I warned both the King and the late Minister for Foreign Ji^ai. against The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, Go Co So I*, KoC.VlO., etc*, etc., etc.V 4S9 against the extravagant claims of the Persian Government ^ In regard to the transferred territories. X reminded then of ny Informal discussions with the Shah and Teymourtache last April, when X stated It as my opinion that the ’l-'fcqi Government could not reasonably be expected to reopen the question of the frontier In the region of the Khanaqln oilfield, which had been definitely delimited so recently as 1915. I ©aid that I had tentatively suggested in Tehran that, if it was decided to connect this oilfield by a pipe line to the Mediterranoan and materially to increase its output, the best arrangement would be for the field to be worked as a single unit and for the royalties to be shared between the two Governments. This arrangement had seemed to appeal to the Shah at the time and had been welcomed by King Faisal, when I had explained it to him on my return from ay vieit to Persia. The present draft, however, put forward by the Persian Minister, seemed to me a grotesque travesty of these proposals. 8, Nuri Pasha, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, called on me yesterday and said that he had recently been visited *y the Persian Minister, who tried for more than three hours to persuade him to enter into negotiations for the rectification of the Perso-’Ira* frontier. The Persian Minister^ demand* inched a claim that the boundary between the two States in the Shatt-al-Arab should he the thalweg of the main stream. Monsieur Kassemi explained tha. the Shah had refused to endorse the provisional arrangement in regard to sh.,,-.!-*-.* &lt;«&gt;» *..» Brrlv.4 .« ‘ w ..« .M. *“■ mrl P ”’“ in April, 19S8, and that he aoveretentysovereignty over half the vatenrajr. Hurl Paaha aaid that tit had infonaed Monsieur Kasrai that tha 4 lraQi CK&gt;v©rnaant declined to reopen the question of the frontier. In their vieWf the question of the frontier» not only in the vicinity of Khanaqin but in the 8hatt«al*jirab and elee^iere, was a chose jug§e which they could not agree to reopen. If the Persian Oovern&amp;ent felt that they had any specific grievance in regard to this frontier, it was open to them to take it to an international court* on the other hand, the 'Iraqi Qcverruaent were perfectly prepared to discuss in a friendly spirit any question regarding the navigation of the Shatt or the working cf the Khaneqin oilfields on both sides of the frontier as a single unit, fhe 'Iraqi Governaent were not, however, prepared to surrender any of the sovereign rights which they had inherited from the Gttonan Empire. Huri Pasha aaid that Monsieur Kazemi was ao upset by hia firm attitude on the question of frontier revision that he was unable to shake hin off by 2.30 p.®* fi nd was obliged to invite him to lunch and continue the discussion throughout the meal. Huri told me that he attributed Monsieur Kazemi's attitude to Feroughi, who was seeking an opportunity of Ixpreealng cn the Shah that he was pursuing a more virile frostier policy than TeymourSache had done. He told ne, however, that the present ' .,a&lt;ii Government were determined not to be bounced by the Persians into giving up any of then- territory or aurrenderlng their eoverelgn righte in any part of the Shatt-al'Arab. 6. l am eendlng a copy of t&amp;le despatch to Hie Majesty's Minister at Tehran. 1 have ftc. &gt; (Signed) P.H.

Plans Division. 7th Hoveaber 1934 Dear It was arranged at a meeting of the Middle Bast (Official) Sub-Committee held on the 17th September, that the Service Departments, in conjunction with the Mercantile Marine Department of the Board of Trade, should attest to assess the possible danger to the Shatt-el-Arab due to erosion of the banks, on information to be supplied by Colonel Ward. A meeting with Colonel Ward for this purpose was held at the Admiralty on the 20th September, and attended by representatives of the Foreign Office, Board of Trade and Air Ministry. I am now writing to give you a summary of the tentative conclusions which have been formed by the Admiralty as a result of the meeting with Colonel Ward. It is important to emphasise that these conclusions are, in fact, extremely tentative. Colonel Ward has himself admitted that he is not an engineer and it is clear that, in the absence of a full investigation of the whole problem of the Shatt by a competent Civil Engineer, any views formed are bound to be hypothetical. Colonel Ward* s main idea was that the shatt might burst its right bank at the bend above Abadan and break through into the Khor Abdullah. On this point the Admiralty think that, on the evidence available, it is unlikely that the breaching of the right bank of the Shatt would take place so suddenly as to be catastrophic. It is quite possible that the bank might be breached and if so, the formation of a eraanent channel or channels would probably extend over er a*C.

N# , Mercantile Marine Department Board of Trade.several ayaWLfj|.msrttl flood seasons, unless assisted by ill- designed irrigation or other channels. If the breach did occur, immediate remedial measures would be necessary, otherwise it is probable that the navigable channel of the Shatt below the breach would seriously deteriorate. Colonel Ward also mentioned the possibility that the Karun River might be dammed at Mohaamerah and its waters diverted down the Bahmanshir which was its former channel to the sea. This is a suggestion which was very fully considered in connection with the dredging of the Bar. There seems to be no dispute between the experts as to the fact that most of the silt comes down the Karun, which is a very fast flowing river until it joins the Shatt. The sudden slowing down of its flow at the junction explains the formation of the Mohammerah Bar. In contradistinction to the Karun, the Tigris and Euphrates pass through a big marshy area above Basrah where most of the silt is deposited and from which they emerge as very nearly clear water. If, therefore, the Karun were to be diverted down the Bahmanshir, it is very probable that the silting of the Shatt would be reduced perhaps almo* to vanishing point As against this it was the view of Sir FredericK Palmer in June 1923 that it would be extremely costly to rehabilitate the silted up bed of this dead river and that the operation would entail serious physical difficulties* At an earlier stage, Sir George Buchanan (Director of Port Ministration and Conservancy, Basrah, during the British occupation) had expressed the view that the Karun itself could onl,v he ?aa really satisfactory from the navigational point of 'view prohibitive cost, and this suggests that inontj j r Hs diversion down the Bahmanshir is unlikely to be forthcoming. The.- 3 - The real danger in connection with the Kanin Beams to he the possibility of ill*informed Persian meddling which might result in inundation of the Anglo Persian Oil Company’s plant at Abadan or some similar untoward event* The Admiralty view, therefore, is that Colonel Ward’s opinion is probably pessimistic and represents the extreme view but that it is impossible to pronounce definitely on the available evidence* W© remain of the opinion that ultimately the only satisfactory and workmanlike solution of the problem is a Conservancy Board with jurisdiction on both banks of the river and if possible over the Karun and Bahmanshir. But the question of how big a price it is justifiable to pay for this Board cannot at present be answered with any certainty* I am sending similar letters to 1.

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1 . [E 5844/58/34] • No. 1. Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes to Sir John Simon. — (Received September 18.) (No. 540.) Bagdad, September 11, 1934. IN your despatch No. 511 of the 30th July concerning the Iraq-Persia frontier question you requested my observations on the following points:— (a) Whether or not His Majesty’s Government should give diplomatic support to the Iraqi Government in their discussions with the Persian Government. (b) Whether, if the necessity arose, His Majesty’s Government should recommend to Iraq to appeal to the Council of the League of Nations in respect of the refusal of the Persian Government to recognise the frontier as laid down in 1914. 2. With regard to the first point, while it may be true that in the present state of Anglo-Persian relations the intervention of His Majesty’s Government might not be effective—a matter on which I am not competent to express an opinion—I think that, from the local point of view here in Ba.gdad, the consideration that such intervention is prompted by a sense of compliance with the obligations laid upon us by the Treaty of Alliance outweighs such an objection. Generally speaking, and except when Iraq is threatened Irom outsi e, the Treaty of Alliance is considered here to be a one-sided instrument from which the Iraqis derive little benefit. Moreover, it has been unfortunately necessary for His Majesty’s Government constantly to appeal to the treaty with a view to exacting compliance by Iraq with its provisions. It would, therefore, cr eate a good impression and fortify our case in pressing the Iraqis to com P 1 J, treaty if we on our side set an example of honouring obligations. Never ^ ’ as the Iraqi Government have recently been at some pains to sohdt our support over Persian affairs in general, I think it is desirable not to be too eage proffer it until it is requested over some specific matter. In sue algo our help, for what it is worth, would be the more apprecia e , have a lever for obtaining from Iraq our other desiderata. whpthpr the 3. With regard to the question of an appeal to the Le g follow such formal offer of a Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Board should 0r f niator y a step, the present position appears to be that Persia is adopting 1 t h ^ attitude.

There are two points of detail to which I would draw your attention. It is hoped that in the near future Persia will not be in a position to claim control over any part of the Rookah Channel. If you refer to Chart No. 1235, you will observe a shaded patch north of the word £ £ Hor liable to dry at certain tides and thus to be claimed, so I understand, as a Persian island. Colonel Ward has informed me that this patch is being washed away by the combined tidal streams and river current which, by the gradual silting up of the western channel and the extension of the Abdullah Bank, are being canalised down the Rookah Channel. In fact, I understand that this patch has almost altogether disappeared, which, of course, means the pushing back to low-water mark on the mainland of the point from which the 3-mile limit would be measured. This would keep the whole of the Rookah Channel outside Persian territorial waters. One cannot, nevertheless, rely on this state of affairs continuing indefinitely, such are the vagaries of the river current. The dredging service is only too familiar with the constant and rapid formation of sandbanks at places least expected. 5. The second minor point, to which I would draw your attention, also refers to the river bed. In paragraph 7 of your despatch under reference it is stated that £ £ Persia possesses sovereignty over the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab up to the medium filum aquce (or at least up to the thalweg) at and above the junction of the Karun.” If you will refer to p. 150 of the Recueil des Proces-verbaux des Seances de la Commission de Delimitation de la Frontiere turco-yersane (tableau descriptif ....), you will observe that from Touweidjat to ££ borne No. 2,” which comprises the section of the river in question, the frontier is drawn along the medium fdum aquae. Now, according to the latest information in my possession, derived from Colonel Ward, the present thalweg, which is after all the only thing that matters where shipping is concerned, is on the Iraqi side of the medium filum aquae. So the position here does not seem so unfavourable to Iraq as would appear, although the Persians will no doubt try to make conditions as difficult as possible. 6.

COMMrCT&amp;^ 14 NOV B34 remous papers 2730 1000 4,34 Perso-Iraqi relations haye for some time been extremely bad and it will be remembered that the proposed visit of the Shah of Persia to Baghdad last spring to repay the visit made to Tehran in 1932 ai the late King Peisal did not take place and that when the Shah visited Turkey last June he was careful to avoid passing through Iraq territory on his journey to and from Turkey. The chief cause of bad feeling between Iraq and Persia is that ^the Persians refuse to accept the frontier laid down by the TurKo-Persian Protocol and Delimitation Commission of 1913-14. Except at two doubtful places the frontier' on the Shatt- el-Arab was defined by this agreement so as to run/run along the left hank; of the river, thus laaving the whole of the waterway in what is now Iraq territory. The Persians regard this frontier as derogatory to their dignity and have taken up the attitude of refusing to recognise the validity of the Turfcn-Persian Frontier Agreement. Several incidents have occurred in the Shatt owing to the activities of the Persian Customs authorities and the warships of the Persian Navy, who ignore the River Navigation Regulations laid down by the Port of Basra authorities. While the frontier on the Shatt is the chief bone of contention between the two countries this is not the only part of the frontier which is in dispute. A lengthy statement of Iraqi complaints against Persia will be found in the letter (with enclosure) of 14th August last from the late Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Persian Minister in Baghdad at P.Z.5847/34. Unfortunately Tawfiq sued! rather spoilt his case by asserting that the terms of the 1913 Protocol had been put into force as between rurkey and Persia, which is/in fact the case. (It appears indeed that in the negotiations leading up to the Turfco- Persian Frontier Agreement of 1933 the Persian Government itself endeavoured to induce the Turkish Government to recognise the 1913 Protocol but failed to do so.) Also the Iraqi Foreign Minister, as the Admiralty have pointed out, S far in protesting against the entry without permission of Persian warships into the Shatt, since notification is the most that should have been expected according to international custom. it appears too that the Iraqis are acting under a misapprehension of the position in protesting against a violation of the frontier by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (page S' of the enclosure to the Iraqi Foreign Minister's letter). previously been hoped that the Persian grievance about the Shatt frontier might be satisfied by the conclusion Conservancy Board Convention in which the Persians would participate/235 linute Paper. Department. participate and 'which, would therefore give them a certain degree of control over the waterway without, however, altering the present frontier, and the attitude of the Shah towards a solution on these lines seemed not unfavourable at the time of King Peisal’s visit to lehran in the spring of 1932. Since then, however, the Shah 1 s attitude has hardened and there now seems little likelihood that Persian amour propre will be satisfied by the conclusion of such a convention unaccompanied by any modification of the frontier. 3 The Iraqis recently asked H.M.G. for advice as to the line which they should pursue in dealing with the Persians on this question and they were advised by the P.0, that in the opinion of H.M.G. they had a sound legal case for maintaining the validity of the present frontier and the binding character of the 1913-14 Agreement, The P.O., however, were extremaly doubtful whether it would be desirable to advise the Iraqi Government to press for (or accept) a reference of the question to the League of Nations, or whether such a reference would be in the best interests of Iraq or of H.M.G. An interesting memorandum by the F.O. on the policy to be adopted by H.M.G. in dealing with this ## t* question ■will be found at flag A * It vill be seen that the P.O. were afraid that a reference to the League might draw unwelcome attention to two important exceptions in the 1914 delimitation to the definition of the frontier in the Shatt as following the low water mark on the Persian bank. It appears that at Mohammerah the frontier laid down by the Protocol might well be Persia the Thalweg or midstream line/ interpreted as giving 2621 6000 3 344 - line for some miles, while it is probable that the most correct interpretation of the agreement would now give to Persia most of the Hooka channel at the mouth of the Shatt. Since it appears that no other channel could be opened up as an alternative to the Hooka channel, the control of the latter would in effect give Persia a great measure of control over the entire waterway. 4-. On the other hand the P. 0. considered that a continuance of the present situation was open to even graver risks in view of the continued hostility and obstruction of Persia in all matters connected v^/ith the waterway. in the absence of Persian cooperation the flood waters of the Persian river Karun flow into the Shatt entirely uncontrolled, bringing down large quantities of mud which threaten to silt up the main while the flood water itself is navigable channel, into'' cutting its way/the south hank of the Shatt at the big bend above Abadan. Colonel Ward, the Basra Port Director, considers that there is a real risk of the Shatt breaking through to the Khor Abdullah, thus becoming entirely unnavigable and cutting off the Port of Basra from the sea. Since Basra is Iraqis only port this would be a much more serious matter for Iraq than for the Persians who have other ports and, according to the P.O., would be quite prepared to let the Shatt waterway become unnavigable failing a satisfaction of their grievances about the frontier. The Persians have already threatened to force the A.P.O.C. to use their new port of Khor Musa on the Persian Gulf instead of Abadan on the Shatt. view of this situation the P.0.suggested that H.M.G. should exercise their influence to bring about a friendly settlement between Iraq and Persia under which Iraq/linute Paper. 2S4 Department. t A.- 1 ^ CB?' iXl _ — - 5 - Iraq would concede to Persia the Thalweg frontier in the Shatt-el-Arab, but only in return for (a) immediate Persian acceptance of the Conseryancy Board Convention, and (b) the recognition by Persia of the validity of the whole of the rest of the frontier. The F.O. also emphasised the possible danger of the Iraqis and Persians accepting Turkish arbitration on the frontier question or coming to some other agreement between themselves which would not take into consideration at all the interests of H.M. G. Quite apart from the value of ths Shaft to British commerce the waterway is of almost vital strategic importance to H.M.G. in view of our military commitments in Iraq and the consequent necessity of using it for the transport of military stores. A meeting of the Middle East sub-Committee was held on 17th September last for the purpose of considering the P.0, proposals. A record of the meeting will be found ii •&gt; at flag 2 . It will be seen that the Service Departments were extremely sceptical about the F.O. proposals. They were inclined to doubt whether the Persians were at present in a position to Oj.fer any obstruction to navigati# in the Shatt which could not be overcome, or whether, even if the Persians had it in their power to offer such obstruction, there was any solid guarantee that frontier concessions would in the long run make them more amenable as neighbours. In view of past experience of making concessions to Persia the Service Departments were extremely reluctant to any concession being made in the Shatt except in for some definite and tangible _quid joro jjuo. agreed that a further meeting should be held between Colonel/ 2621 6000 3 346 Colonel Ward and representatives of the Admiralty, Air Ministry and Board of Trade to consider in greater detail the extent of the physical dangers at present threatening the Shatt waterway, and that meanwhile the F.O. should ask their Legal Advisers for information as to the legal position of the Shatt in time of war mrespectof the free passage from the open sea to Basra of British warships, aircraft and stores as it would be (a) with he frontier as at present, and (b) with the Thalweg frontier contemplated by the F. 0 # proposals. ro\iLxji &gt; j 7 . Nuri Pasha, the present Iracp. Foreign mnis ter, ulr \ arrived in London on 17th September (the day of the meeting of the Middle East Sub-Committee) for three days and had interviews at the F.O. with Sir Robert Vansittart ^ r * ^ enc “- e ^i Arfi ant i o ip —hy - -the- Fr-Qn 4 k raised the question of the desirability of appealing to the League against the refusal of Persia to recognise the frontier laid down by the 1913-14 Turko-Persian Agreement. The F.O. pointed out to him the dangers in connexion with the frontier at the Rooka Channel and at the part of the river near Mohammerah and also the possible danger that a reference to the League might lead to suggestions for a compromise detrimental to Iraq's interests. Ruri was inclined to discount these dangers. was finally suggested by Sir R. Vansittart that the best course might be for the Iraqis^without actually t&gt; ing to the League^to show the strength of their hand y making it plain that they were ^if necessary prepared do so. Having thus called the Persian bluff they , as an act of grace, offer the Conservancy Board nd certain other minor concessions. If the Persians proved iecalcitrant^Iraqis could then reconsider the possibility of appealing to the League. Huri promised to think carefully over this advice and to H.M.G. as soon as the Iraqi Government had reached - . ^ &gt;linute Pap® 1 ** Department. 2621 GOOO 3 34 - ? - decision.

Air Ministry consulted the A.O.C., Iraq, on the F.O. proposals for suggesting to the Iraqis that they should offer the Thal-weg frontier to Persia in return for the Conservancy Board. The A.O.C.’s views which mere hostile to the F.O. proposals M M are at Flag C and the F.O. counter criticisms of the A.O.C^s views are contained in their letter of 10th October to the Air Ministry (P.Z.6353/34). From paragraph 4 of their letter it will be seen that the Admiralty and the Board of Trade are still investigating the extent of the dangers to the Shaft waterway if nothing is done to conciliate the Persians. It is quite probable that these^vfill be found to have been exaggerated by the F.O. and their advisers. We are not very directly concerned with the genera, question which affects U.K. rather than Indian interests, but if the Conservancy Board Scheme comes to anything we are closely interested in the arrangement, at present provided for in the draft Conservancy Board Convention under which the new Board,which would have a Persian member, would take over^the Persian Gulf Lighting oys em We are of course strongly averse to any Persian interference with the Arab Coast Lights and it is therefore desirable that we should have an opportunity of reconsidering this arrangement.

Both panties having thus expressed their stand point without loss of face main body of Treaty might contain a recital of existing frontier without mentioning 1913 protocol. Minister for Foreign Affairs therefore enquires whether fact of his thus agreeing to existing land frontier and being silent over river frontier would vitiate Iraqi case for the latter. Presumably not as we have advised Iraqis that in law it is cast-iron. He requests your opinion. (2) If your opinion is in the negative Minister for Foreign Affairs then requests that in the absence of competent legal adviser in Bagdad the Foreign Office should draft a clause or clauses dealing with river and maritime • • •maritime section of frontier providing for a Conservancy Board and free mandate etc. for Persia but retaining present boundary.

In view of further developments reported in your telegram No. 232 (of October 25th) and particularly of offer by Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to put forward on his return to Tehran new proposals for settlement of frontier question, I presume that replies to specific questions raised in your telegram No. 229 (of October 23rd) are no longer required, at any rate until precise nature of new Persian proposals is knov/n. 2. Generally speaking, however, effect of any agreement redefining one part of the frontier only would be to weaken Iraqi case for contending that 1913/14 definition of frontier as a whole is valid and binding; while I am advised that as regards that part of the frontier v/hich was not defined in the new agreement insertion of statement in preamble that Persia did not recognise 1913/14 definition of the frontier would further prejudice Iraqi case. 3.

It primarily concerns the frontier delineated by the 1913-1914 Boundary Commission, in particular Persian claims over areas of the Shatt el-Arab, and rights to oilfields in the Naft Khana [Naft Khāna] or Khaniqin [Khāniqīn]area. The papers document renewed negotiations over the border, and include discussion of the following topics: Iraqi concerns over Persian military activities conducted in Iraq; Persia's refusal to recognise the validity of the 1914 Frontier Delimitation Protocol; attempts to redraw the frontier at the Shatt el-Arab along the
                           thalweg[valley way], as opposed to the
                           medium filum aquae; proposals to revive the Shatt el-Arab Conservancy Board Scheme; and proposals for an agreement to regulate the exploitation of the oilfields in the transferred territories on the frontier near Khanqin, including the proposed creation of a special zone. These papers primarily consist of correspondence between the following: HM Ambassadors at Baghdad, Teheran and Italy; the India Office Political Department; the Foreign Office (principally Sir John Simon, and J C Sterndale-Bennet); the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs; and the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs.In 1935 the Iraqi Government formally raised the question of the frontier with the Council of the League of Nations, and sought a Court ruling as to the validity of the 1914 Boundary Protocol. The Italian delegate to the League (Baron Pompeo Aloisi) was designated Rapporteur to the negotiations, and the volume contains correspondence between the Foreign Office and HM Ambassador in Rome, regarding a proposed Italo-Iraqi Treaty of Friendship, proposals regarding the frontier made by Aloisi, and general Italian influence over Iran and Iraq. The volume also includes copies of memoranda and minutes circulated by the League, in addition to correspondence regarding the negotiations in Geneva and Italy, and documents from the Committee of Imperial Defence Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East.The volume includes a divider giving a list of correspondence references found in the volume by year.
