N * 22nd December, 1938• Your Excellency, With reference to your note No. 190.Proc.9 of the 2nd ultimo, regarding your desire to secure the loan of certain articles for inclusion in the Exhibition to be held in connexion with the Portuguese centenary celebrations in 1940, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that your wishes in this matter were duly conveyed to His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury and to the several museums concerned. In addition, the Government of India have been asked to approach the Sultan of Muscat to obtain if possible a list of exhibits which His Highness would be willing to lend to the Portuguese Government. 2. With regard to the XVIIth Century Chalice to which you refer, the Archbishop of Canterbury assumes that this is the gilt ciborium which was recently on exhibition in this country, the shape of the vessel suggesting that it was a ciborium rather than a chalice. His Grace, in signifying that he will be most happy to grant the loan of the vessel, notes that the greatest care will be taken to ensure the safety of the exhibit from the time it leaves Lambeth Palace until its return there, and would appreciate it if he could be informed of the arrangements made in due course. 3. The Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum has intimated that the Board of Education are willing to lend the Chinese bottle to the Portuguese Government for the celebrations. His Excellency Senhor Dr. Armindo R. Monteiro etc. etc., etccelebrations# They would, however, be grateful to be given further particulars of the date and place of the Exhibition as they are anxious, if possible, that the bottle should not be absent from the Museum’s collection during the last week in July, 1939, when the members of the International Congress of the History of Art will be visiting London. 4. With regard to Your Excellency’s request for an exhibit from the British Museum I have the honour to inform you that under the British Museum Act, 1924, which embodies all the powers possessed by the Trustees for making loans, they are not empowered to make loans abroad. They regret therefore that it will not be possible for them to lend the ’’Genealogy of the Kings of Portugal” by Antonio da Holanda and Simao Bening, to the Portuguese Government. 5. The Trustees of the National Maritime Museum have expressed regret that they are unable to accede to the request for the loan of the painting ’’Manueline Ships”, as this picture is the only one belonging to the Trustees which represents vessels of the XVth century painted by a XVth century artist, and the donor of the picture stipulated that it should not leave Greenwich. 6. I shall have the honour to address a further note to you as soon as a reply is received from the Government of India as to the possibility of obtaining the loan of suitable objects from the authorities at Muscat. I have the honour to be, with the highest consideration, Your Excellency’s obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State)'/I;’I^kny further communication on this Subject, please quote &lt; 2 * 0 .

Sir, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to state for the information of the Secretary of State for India that he has been approached by the Portuguese Ambassador at this Court with a view to obtaining the loan of objects for inclusion in an Exhibition to be organised in connexion with the celebrations to be held in Portugal in 1939 and 1940 on the occasion of the eighth centenary of the foundation of the Portuguese Nation and the third centenary of the re establishment of Portuguese independence. 2* Senhor Monteiro has explained that the Exhibition will consist of objects of historical interest designed to give a true impression of the extent and scope of Portugal’s influence in the world and of her contribution to civilisation and has requested assistance in securing from the authorities at Muscat, where Portuguese vestiges abound, the loan of suitable exhibits. Every care would be taken to ensure the safety of such exhibits during the period of the Exhibition and all expenses would be paid by the official organising committee. 3. Lord Halifax is anxious to further the success of the forthcoming celebrations in every way possible, and I am accordingly to enquire whether the Marquess of Zetland would be The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00027e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/267</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00027e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/267</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 7971/1938 'Portugal - Exhibition in 1939-40.
