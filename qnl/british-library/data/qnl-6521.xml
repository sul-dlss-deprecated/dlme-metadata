Russian Invalid, No. 143, 1869. “Sketch of our operations on Coast of the Caspian.” 1745 . 1798 - 1802 . PART I. Trans-Caspian. Russian Acts and Aims. Prince Bekoyitch Cherkaski, who was charged in 1716 with the fatal expedition to Khiva, erected the East the first Russian fortifications on the East coast of the Caspian, viz.:— Fort Peter, at point Tiuk-Karagan, on the Man gyshlak peninsula. ‘ Fort Alexander-Bai, in the Bakhtyr Liman. Krasnovodsk, in Kizyl-Su-bight, at the southern extremity of the spit which forms Krasnovodsk Bay. These, and all subsequent Russian footings on the East coast of the Caspian, were^ protested against by the successive Khans of Khiva, who regarded them as violations of their rights, de manding the evacuation of the forts up to the time of the last (General Ignatief’s, 1858) mission to Khiva, as the Turcomans and Kirghizes, owning allegiance to Khiva, camped on the coast and in the country between the Khivan oasis and the Caspian, say as far South as Khawrezm Bay. In Khiva the kindred tribes of those Turcomans wielded great power, and on occasions gave Khans to the State. # . After the disastrous failure of Prince Bekovitch Cherkaski’s expedition to Khiva, all the Russian positions on the East coast of the Caspian were abandoned, and no lodgment was again made on it during the reign of Peter the Great or during the reign of the Empress Ann. Even the South littoral acquired by Peter was evacuated. In this year the Turcomans dispersed by Nadir Shah sought refuge on the Mangyshlak peninsula, and some of them were persuaded to proceed as a deputation to St. Petersburg, begging for the erection of a fort for their protection. In these years some of the Turcomans of Man gyshlak w r ere induced to prefer similar requests, and in the year Some of the tribes on the North-East coast were at last officially constituted Russian subjects. A large number of Chaudors were persuaded to apply for a Russian protectorate. During the Russo-Persian war the most southerly Yomud Turcomans in relations with Russia harried the Persians on the Astrabad frontier.In this year General Yermolof, commanding in the Caucasus, despatched Major Ponomaref and Captain Muravief to the East coast of the Caspian to select a point upon it for a naval and military station; the site, according to the instructions given, was to be “ suitable for a wharf, for store- “ houses, for merchandise, and for a fort to pro- “ tect the same.” “ This commission,” Captain Muravief says in his memoirs, “ was given with a “ view to carrying out the design of Peter the “ Great of opening a trade with India through the “ vast country which we call Tartary.” The two above named officers were favourably entertained among the Turcomans who expressed through them a desire to be placed under a Rus sian protectorate, and accompanied by several Turcomans who were won over to their cause by “ means of all those arts of flattery which are so “acceptable among Asiatics, and which he” [so ran the instructions to Captain Muravief] “ was “ not to scruple to employ,” Muravief proceeded to Khiva to prevail upon the Khan at least to countenance the footing wdiich the Russian Go vernment wished to secure on the East coast of the Caspian, representing the advantages which would ensue in the shape of trading relations, &amp;c. But this mission to Khiva was a complete failure; the Khan adhered to his sovereign rights on the Caspian coast,* rejecting also the overtures for the conclu sion of an offensive and defensive alliance. The points on the coast recommended for Russian occupation by the two Russian officers were—one at Krasnovodsk, in the Balkhan Bay, and the other at Gomush-Tepe, close to the embouchure of the Gurgan river. In this yearf Muravief was again despatched to make a more minute survey of the localities pre viously selected, and the site reported as suitable for a wharf, and for a fort for a garrison of 1,000 men, was on the Krasnovodsk spit, a little to the North of that on which Prince Bekovitch Cherkaski had raised one. Being situated in the vicinity of the Balkhan mountains where there was said to be forest, fresh water and pasture, the contemplated establishment was calculated to have in time the desired effect of attracting large bodies of Turco mans to its vicinity. Muravief, on this occasion, erected a temporary fort on Krasnovodsk spit, a little to South of Ak- djar point, which was called Voznesenskoe. The attention of the Russian authorities in the Caucasus being at that time diverted in other direc tions, the question of a lodgment on the East coast of the Caspian was laid aside until / \V hen the Emperor Nicholas, independent x of the efforts which were being made from the Caucasus to bring the various Turcoman tribes within a mea surable distance of Russian influence and authority, authorized Count Sukhtelen, Governor of Orenburg, to organize a surveying expedition from the North,' Muravief’s “ Journey into Turcomania and “ to Khiva.” Russian edition, with plans and maps. Moscow, 1822. * Since the Khan of Khiva has been re duced to vassalage, the Russians have found it convenient to insist on the allegiance owed to the Khan by the Teke Turcomans, but it is instructive to find the claim of Russia to the direct allegiance of the tribes epi tomised as follows in the Russian official Invalid, No. 143, 1869:—“Our relations “ with the Turcomans have been continued “ in an unbroken series from the beginning “ of the last century; although the East “ coast of the Caspian has remained un- “ occupied since the time of Peter the Great, “ yet our right to it rests on numerous ap- “ plications made by the population of the “ Caspian littoral to be accepted by the Tsar “ as subjects of Russia.” It is not less in structive to find that, notwithstanding these numerous applications or tenders of allegi ance by well disposed elders of tribes and other individual Turcomans, whenever the Russians attempted to assert themselves on the East coast, the latter have invariably encountered the most stubborn resistance from the entire Turcoman nation, all the various tribes acting in concert, from the period of the first attempted surveys of the coast to the siege of Geok-Tepe in the year 1880.

Accordingly, Karelin was sent out at the head of an expedition, and as a result, in Fort Novo-Alexandrofsk was built at Kizyl-tash on the eastern shore of Kaidak Bay. [In the year 1844, Fort Novo-Alexandrofsk was replaced by Fort Novo-Petrofsk on Tuik-Karagan point over Nicolai harbour; and in 1868, the latter was re-christened Fort Alexandrofsk.] This position was, however, deemed unsatisfactory and insufficient, therefore, in Another expedition was equipped and sent under Karelin to re-examine the whole of the East coast down to the Persian limits. The surveys were this time extended to Hassan Kuli and Astrabad bays.* Ashurada Naval Station. In the year 1836, a Russian merchant of As trakhan was, under the auspices of his Government, induced to establish a fishery in Hassan-Kuli Bay, where he dwelt in perfect security among the Turcomans. The Russian Caspian flotilla was at that time permanently stationed at the island of Sara, near Lenkoran, and cruisers were sent hut once a year regularly to the East coast calling at Hassan Kuli and Astrabad Bays, and thus opening relations with the Yomud Turcomans. With the Persians the Russian naval authorities entered into no relations, whereas they were even then busy with the Turcomans. The Turcomans had at that period an encampment on the island of Ashurada, and the Russian Captain, Alennikof, on anchoring, as usual, near that island, found there a detachment of Persian troops. The first step towards effecting a lodgment on Ashurada was taken in When, by order of the Commander of the Russian forces in the Caucasus, the commanding naval officer at Sara made an official announcement to the effect that the station at Ashurada was to be a permanent one, and sent the brig “ Araxes,” com manded by Captain Fofanof, to anchor in Ashurada Bay, &lt;f in order to protect any Russian trading “ vessels which might appear on those waters and “ to guard the Persian coast from Turcoman “ piracies.” The first attempt to coerce the Turcomans, who had until then given no offence to the Russians, was signalized by the destruction of a Russian boat’s crew by those subjects of Persia. On the strength of this, the brig “ Araxes ” was provided with guns, but fhe Russian sailors being unequal to cope with the Turcomans in the smaller craft and failing therefore to establish anything like an authority over them, other and stronger measures were now contemplated. The necessity for these had been foreseen by Count Medem, 6662. Bm &lt;( the Russian Ambassador at Teheran, on whose initiative the first step towards a permanent esta blishment at Ashurada was taken. “ The Russian “ Ambassador felt the need of some 1 point d'appui' “ for the maintenance of his influence over the “ affairs and policy of Persiathe bay of Astrabad “ offered the very base he wanted.” Count Medem argued that although “ the Russian Government “ had from time to time made efforts to cul- “ tivate trade in the bay, yet Russian traders - “ stood in fear of Turcoman pirates ; therefore “ they stood in need of a permanent force for “ their protection, and seeing that the Persians “ were prohibited by treaty from building war “ ships, we (Russians) are bound by obligations “ of friendship to protect their shores which are “ subject to piratical attacks. Count Medem “ applied for only one vessel lest any more should « create too great a sensation in Persia; knowing “ that the force of circumstances would, in course of time, compel the Russian Admiralty to increase the force in Astrabad Bay.” Acting on Count Modem’s recommendation, the Russian Government in the year 1841 sent M. (later Count and Admiral) Putiatin to carry the Ambassador’s project into execution. To give a colour to and a pretext for his pro ceedings, or in the words of the Russian writer (an officer who served on the “ Araxes ” and other vessels at the period in question) a in order to “ make it appear in the eyes of the Persian Govern- « ment that there was really a necessity for per- t( manently stationing our vessels in Astrabad Bay, “ the Pinance Minister, at the request of Count « Medem, granted a certain sum of money for the “ purchase of various merchandise, which was put “ on board vessels hired at Astrakhan under a super- “ cargo and a certain merchant called Erivandof, “ and transported to Astrabad and Enzeli Bays.” Two of these vessels anchored off Gez in the spring of 1842, and a sort of fair was held on the shore to the astonishment of the stupefied Persians. In the meantime M. Putiatin passed from Astra bad to Teheran to smooth matters with the Persian Government. It was M. Putiatin who, acting in concert with -Ctruuu Medem, laid the foundations of the Russian naval station at Ashurada. After consultation with the Russian Ambassador at Teheran M. Putiatin returned to his vessel in Astrabad Bay, made an armed descent on one of the largest Turcoman en campments ^(Chikishlar) in Hassan Kuli Bay, obtained the surrender of a certain influential Turcoman named Yakhshi-Mahmed and exacted from the tribesmen a money contribution on behalf of Persia. At the same time he established the 1 system of permits without which no Turcoman was allowed to enter the bay. The method of issue of these permits was as follows. Application for a permit to enter the bay for purposes of barter was, in the first instance, made to a certain chosen headman among the Turcomans, and the permit so 1841. “ Russian Naval Magazine,” No. 12, 1863. 1842.7 1842. 1845. “ Russian Naval Magazine,” No. 12, 1863. * Mr. Thomson, attached to the British Embassy in Persia. “ Russian Naval Magazine,” No. 12,1863. obtained was then exchanged for one given under the seal of the Russian naval officer commanding the guard ship stationed in the bay, but all boats were searched, and arms were seized to be delivered up again to the natives when they passed from the bay homewards. At the invitation of Count Medem, and with the support of the Russian Government, a Moscow trading company was at last formed in 1845 under the firm of Elizarof, Baranof, Remezof and Co., and several of this company’s vessels arrived off the Astrabad coast in the early part of the summer of 1846. The Persian Government having refused to sanction the construction of any storehouses or buildings on Persian territory, the Russian naval commander of the Ashurada station, who was earnestly requested by Count Medem and the home authorities to find means to inaugurate a Russian trade with Persia, took the matter into his own hands, and landing the men from his flag ship, the “ Baku ” on the Astrabad coast near Gez, at a point “ seven versts beyond the Kara-Su, which is con- “ sidered the frontier line of Persia f ordered them at once to build sheds in which the Russian mer chandise was at once displayed for sale. In the Russian narrative here quoted, the writer states that a certain Mr. Thomson,* having secretly crossed the Persian frontier, instigated a Turcoman attack on the Russian sheds. Mr. Thomson, it is said, engaged 30 Turcomans for this purpose at 12 ducats each; but 12 Turcomans refused to pro ceed with the business because, on crossing the Kara-Su river at night, they were advised of the necessity of putting to death three watchmen. This attack is said to have failed and to have led to the immediate construction of a factory on the mainland on the River Kara-Su, which was protected by a guard of from three to five sailors who were landed every evening with a one-pounder falconet gun charged with grape. This gun having been found in position by a Persian customs officer, the fact was reported to Teheran, but the Russian Minister at Teheran, on being called upon by the Persian Government for an explanation, boldly asserted that it was not a gun but merely a wooden model and advised the Russian officer com manding at Astrabad to have a model speedily made and exhibited in corroboration of the assertion. This was done, but the Governor of Astrabad undertaking to protect the factory, the Russian guard was withdrawn, and thus the Russian establishment on the coast was taken under Persian protection while the Persian Government still with held its formal sanction of it. Colonel Sheil repeatedly drew the attention of the British and Persian Governments to the Russian encroachments on the Persian coast of the Caspian, and Mr. Thomson adduced strong evidence of the endeavours of the Russians to establish themselves permanently at Ashurada and on the mainland, as8 •well as to win over the Turcomans to a Russian allegiance, while they were even at that period opening an intercourse with the Chief of Bujnurd. Notwithstanding Colonel Shiel’s representations and Mr. Thomson’s later reports, the Russian hold on Ashurada and her naval power in Astrabad Bay, were gradually strengthened. A Russian Consul was established at Astrabad in 1846, and in the year 1866 the Shah was induced to go on board one of the ships of the Russian flotilla off Ashurada, which circumstance seemed to give a sanction to the Russian establishment on that island. 1845, Vide Sir E. Herstlet’s summary of corre spondence on this subject in his Memorandum on Russian Encroachments in Western Turkestan, and in the direction of Asterabad (Ashoorada, &amp;c.).—Foreign Office, 1st Feb ruary 1873 (Confidential). 1846. 1866. The activity of Russia in the far East having been suspended on account of the Crimean war (1854—1856), she redirected her attention to that quarter soon after the termination of that cam paign, and in the year 1858 General Katenin of Orenburg, and Field Marshal Prince Bariatinski, commanding in the Caucasus, reopened the question of the military occupation of a site in Balkhan Bay. In the year 1859, the project of erecting a fort in that bay received the Imperial sanction. Colonel Eandevil accordingly headed a surveying expedition to the East coast of the Caspian. Starting from Gurief, the survey was conducted to the Bay of Astrabad, the whole of the Caspian flotilla being engaged in the sendee, with land forces and a numerous stall of officers, aided by Turcoman Chiefs brought over to the interests of Russia, whose in fluence with the tribes w r as calculated to facilitate the surveying operations carried inland and to pro mote the object of winning the Yomud and other Turcomans from Tuik-Karagan to the Gurgan river over to Russian allegiance. To this end also Baron Wrangel was deputed by the authorities of the Caucasus to join the expedition with cargoes of various merchandise, by means of which, through opening a trade with the Turcomans at Krasnovodsk and at other points farther South, the tribes were to be drawn into mere intimate relations with the Russians and general information concerning them and the trans-Caspian regions was to have been acquired. It appears from the diary kept on the occasion of this expedition and published by Captain Galkin, one of the officers attached to the survey, that all the tribes, including even the Adayef Kirghizesof Man gyshlak, headed by their Chief, Baimambet Mayev, vigorously opposed the Russians, the Kirghizes placing impediments in the matter of the supply of camels and the Turcomans organizing armed re sistance to and attacking the detachments escorting the land surveying parties. The Russians held numerous hostages on hoard the sloops which main tained communications with the parties ashore; yet such was the inimical bearing of the Turcomans that Colonel Dandevil, commanding at Ashurada, after communicating with the Russian Consul at 1858. 1859. * /Astrabad and with the Russian Minister at Teheran, made a descent on the Turcomans of Chikishlar in Hassan Kuli Bay, shelling the Turcomans and driving them out of their encampments, burning their tents and stores and destroying upwards of fifty of their boats. After this, the Turcomans, under threats of condign punishment, were made to pay an in demnity for lost camels and were obliged to liberate their Persian slaves who were forwarded to Colonel Gusef at Astrabad. Captain Galkin observes in his diary that an English Agent* made his appearance, in the month of April 1859, at Ashur (Ashurada), ostensibly with the object of negotiating with the Turcomans the purchase of some land on the Attrek while he secretly instituted inquiries as to the intentions of the Russians in regard to the Turcomans and into the objects of the expedition. Surveying parties having been pushed into the Balkhans from Krasnovodsk to examine the nature of the country and the fresh water wells, it was ascertained that a desirable footing at Krasnovodsk might be established at that point, whence an influence might be exercised over the Turcomans, and which might serve as a tete dn pont. Several Turcoman Elders having been bribed to serve as Russian agents and placed in communi cation with the naval commander at Ashurada and the Russian Consul at Astrabad for the furtherance of Russian aims, the expedition terminated, re sulting in a recommendation of a site in Krasno vodsk Bay as an eligible one for the establishment of a Russian military basis on the East coast of the Caspian. But the tide of Russian encroachments had set in through prevailing interests in another direction, namely, in that of the Jaxartes from Orenburg and Western Siberia. After the completion of the final subjugation of the hill tribes of the Caucasus and the complete conquest of that country there w r as a perceptible lack of enterprising spirit amongst the officers of the Army of the Caucasus. This gave the desired opportunity to the authorities at St. Petersburg who had taken to heart the Russian moral of the Crimean war with England. Ac cordingly they put forward for adoption the larger plan of pushing Russian conquest in the direction of Bokhara, deferring operations against Khiva and the Turcomans until the closing of the Siberian and Orenburg lines. In this wise the authorities of the Caucasus remained passive spec tators of the operations conducted from Orenburg along the line of the Jaxartes; but when the Turkestan province was finally secured, and Bokhara rendered completely inoffensive, operations were commenced against Khiva, and here the Army of the Caucasus had necessarily to supply its con tingent of troops, the attention of the Viceroy being again called to the East coast of the Caspian with instructions that he should lend himself to 6662. C10 the completion of the work in the country of the Turcomans and along the North-eastern borders of Persia, which had been so frequently commence and never brought to any issue.

The explanation ran as followsThe occupation of a «&lt; site in Balkhan Bay, recommended in 1859, was “ suspended for various political reasons. But m ce the year 1869, the Amir of Afghanistan gamed « fresh strength through the conclusion of a treaty oj « alliance with England, receiving the while an “ annual subsidy from Great Britain, . . . and there “ was the prospect of a coalition against us ot the “ Central Asiatic States with the Kirghizes dis affected to our rule; it was therefore determined « to adopt energetic measures in anticipation ot a « necessity arising to defend our position m Centra “ Asia against the combined operation of those “ Bulers whom, up to that time, we had subduen one bv one.J . «« The state of political affairs, which until then .. had prevented the execution of the^ design, was “ then at last very favourable ; Persia, who had a eve r feared the consequences of our rule on the “ East coast of the Caspian, could not but recog- “ nize it as a fact that our establishment on the « East coast was essential to the tranquillizing ol “ our nomad subjects, and to the security of our c&lt; Central Asian possessions; at the same time « the consolidation of the power of Afghanistan « CO uld not possibly be consistent with her interests. It is impossible to lay too much stress on these naive confessions. , . . , &lt;« Xu accordance with this view, the semi-official organ proceeded to say, &lt;e His Imperial Majesty ** approved the recommendation of the Commander- « i n _Chief of the Army in the Caucasus, to land a &lt;c force at Krasnovodsk under the command of « Colonel (now General, and late Russian Envoy to « Cabul) Stoletof, an officer who was acquainted “ with oriental languages, who had served under 44 the Governor General of Turkestan and who had “ travelled through some parts of Afghanistan and ** Persia.** Russian official writers have subsequently affirmed that prior to the year 1873 the Anglo-Indian 1859. 1869. * First brought to notice of Government in Abstracts Nos.

That more was intended than a mere factory at Krasnovodsk was evidenced by the fact that a considerable reserve force was at the same time organized at Petrofsk and ordered to be in perfect readiness for transport when called upon, which will account for the report that 3,000 men had been conveyed across the Caspian in the first instance.

Government had endeavoured to bring about a coalition of all the Mahomedan States and com munities in Asia against Itussia, and that this fact supplied one of the main reasons for the action taken against the T6kes by the Russian Government. On the other hand, it will he remembered that the military operations against the Tekes were said to have been dictated by a necessity to secure a basis for operations against Khiva, or at least to protect the right exposed flank of the Russian force advancing from Krasnovodsk to Khiva. It is true that the written instructions given to Colonel Stoletof forbad any provocation of the native inhabitants to hostilities and a recourse to arms except only for strictly defensive purposes, yet this cannot but be regarded as an essential caution, tantamount, however, to only an &lt;f ordre du jour ” to an officer whose first duty on effecting the landing was to conciliate the local inhabitants, and who at the outset was entrusted with a body of only 1,000 men. At the same time Colonel Stoletof was supplied with a certain sum of money, and with a variety of articles for distribution in the form of presents to natives of the country; his staff numbered 30 officers, and he had orders to place himself as soon as pos sible in communication with the Governor General of Turkestan by means of trusty messengers. When the troops embarked at Fetrofsk on the 29th October (10th November) 1869, intimation of the same was sent to the Russian Minister at Teheran, who was instructed to acquaint the Persian Government with the object of the descent at Krasnovodsk, and to give assurances that the enter prise would in no way injure the interests of Persia, nor did it imply any hostile design against either that Power or against the Turcomans. On receiving intimation of the Russian project, the Persian Government was much disquieted, and objected as much to the Russian occupation of Krasnovodsk and the Balkhans as it would to any question of its territorial rights between the Bal khans and the Attrek, and between that river and the Gurgan, and eastwards along the frontier of Khorassan to Merv, urging the rights of Persia, which were not invalidated by the fact of the precarious nature of the authority of the Shah over the Turcoman tribes wheresoever they dwelt. Later, however, the Shah was prevailed upon to waive all objection, on the condition that the Rus sians should not cross the Attrek. The relations with the tribes in the vicinity of Krasnovodsk were soon placed on an amicable footing through the agency of some Turcoman Elders from the Attrek and from the neighbour hood of Astrabad, whom the naval commander at Ashurada, having attached them to the Russian service, was commanded to convey to Krasnovodsk on one of the cruisers. Before the year had expired Colonel Stoletof re ported on the expediency of occupying a positionin the Balkhan mountains, where the Yomuds usually encamped for the summer months, a position, he wrote, from which the \cinuils could he terrorized, Khiva could he menaced, and the caravan route from the Caspian to the Oxus could be effectually safeguarded. This project was unhesitatingly approved by the Grand Duke Michael, and in the month of April 1870 Colonel Stoletof was reinforced with infantry, Cossacks, and artillery from the Caucasus. By the 5th (17th) August Colonel Stoletof had completed the dislocation of his troops, and occupied the following places :— Tash-Arvat-Kala, with 3 companies of infantry, 25 mounted Cossacks, and 1 field piece. Mollah-Kari, with 1 company of infantry, sap pers,* foot Cossacks,* 2 field guns, 2 howitzers, and 2 sotnias of Cossacks. On the coast in Michael Bay, with 1 company of infantry and 2 howitzers. Krasnovodsk, with 2 companies of infantry, 2 howitzers, and 9 sappers. “ At Tash-Arvat-Kala Colonel Stoletof, without loss of time, organized a transport corps, with 200 camels, for rapid expeditions in the interior of the country. The object of having this transport corps in readiness was to obviate the possibility of the secret of any plan of march being prematurely divulged.” Being in this wise perfectly ready for any enter prise, Colonel Stoletof reported (1) that while the Jaffarbai Yomuds of the Balkhans were friendly, the Attabai clans eschewed all relations with the Xtussians, and were inclined to be hostile, that they, “ so it was said,” had even sent messengers to the Tek6s to ascertain the intentions of the latter in regard to the Russians ; (2) that the Khan of Khiva had exhorted the Tekes to make an attack on the Bussian post in Michael Bay; and (3) that some 700 to 1,000 families of Adayef Kirghizes had re moved from the Mangyshlak prefecture, and shaken in their allegiance to Bussia, had encamped at a distance of from six to seven marches from Tash-Arvat-Kala. Upon the strength of this the Bussian Government, having first communicated with their Envoy at Teheran, commanded Colonel Stoletof to undertake an expedition against the Yomuds of the lower Attrek, where the great bulk of that tribe dwelt, “in order to compel them to “ throw in their lot with Bussia, and to co-operate «&lt; with the latter in the achievement of the desired u object” (?) One of the direct objects of this operation, as stated by the semi-official Bussian organ, quoting from the official report, was to bring to°a termination all ambiguous relations of the nomads towards the Bussians within the sphere of the operations of the Krasnovodsk column, and to impress it well on their minds that they were no where inaccessible to the Bussian arms. A knowledge of these contemplated hostilities on1870. * This ir the first record of Turcomans performing I. itary service for Russia. “ Russian Military Journal,” March 1872. 1871.

It would appear that the Tekds were the first to make an open attack, which they did on the camp at Michael Bay on the morning of the 20th of October 1870 under the leaderships of Heivaz-Murad, Tykma- Sardar Nur-Verdy Khan, Aral-Mahomed ‘Khan and Son Khan. T , &lt;: ' k6s , were beaten and rou ted with a loss of 30 ki led and 200 wounded, while the Russian loss nas three men killed and four wounded. Abandoning the plan of march to the Attrek amd leaving the Yomuds of Chikishlar and Hassan- Kuh Bay to be dealt with by the naval forces, Lelonel Stoletof equipped a column of 700 men with 30 horses and 670 camels which some months pre viously had by various means been obtained from the wandering Yomuds and Tekes, and marched trom Mollah-Kan to Kizyl-Arvat on the 30th No vember (12th December) 1870. The Russian column arrived at Kizvl-Arvat on the 10th (22nd) December 1870, and finding the place abandoned, demolished the kala or fork and burned and destroyed all the property which they found within and around it. The Tdkds offered no resistance, hut a horde being observed some wav beyona on an elevation, a body of Cossacks, with some Turcoman horsemen in the Russian service were sent to scatter it A * ra ^ country of the Akhal lekes was 11 camels. From Kizyl-Arvat the Tekes were said to have removed, with Sofi-Khan at their head, to a point m the old bed of the Oxus. Leaving Kizyl-Arvat on the 12th (24th) De cember, Colonel Stoletof returned with his column to Mollah-Kari on the 19th (31st) December, capturing a party of Tuadji Turcomans camping in the desert, and adding 30 more camels to ^ the number secured at Kizyl-Arvat. In the meanwhile the Attabai Yomuds of Persia dwelling at Hassan-Kuli and Chikishlar duly re ceived a raking fire from the boats and small steamers of the Aral flotilla, by reason of the land torce being elsewhere similarly engaged. This land force traversed a distance of 500 versts (333 miles) m 22 days (including two day halts), 4 a feat which was calculated to impress the “ nomads with the capabilities of the Russian troops, the expedition itself having given the ‘ -Russians an opportunity to gain an 'insight into « nature of the region, and to explore the most c xi CU ^ au ^ ^ ia *' ^ me least known portion &lt;t of th . e from Krasnovodsk to the eastern ex- “ tremity of Khorassan, or avoiding the latter ' directly to Afghanistan.” The beginning of the year of 1871 found Colonel btoletof possessed of only 100 camels, and unable to procure more, “through the activity of the agent of the Khan of Khiva, who prevailed upon 6662 . Dli the various tribes to decamp with their herds « from within reach of the Russians.” The Russian commander soon, however, found means to bring back to adjacent pastures a Yomud clan with 400 camels, and another under Sheidan Bek, with all his herds. He also sent out two reconnoitring expeditions, one to Tuar and the other, under Captain (now General) Scobelet, to Uzun- Kui (27 miles short of Sary-Kamysh), both of which were calculated to have the effect of neutralizing the influence of the Khan of Khiva over the nomads. The Colonel’s measures for securing a supply of camels were partially successful, and therefore he received orders to manceuvre further i( with a view “ to place the Yomuds in subjection to Russia, and “ to exact guarantees from the Tekes for the fulfil- ** ment of all Russian demands upon them,^ and to “ make them look to Russia for protection.” This was to be effected by an expedition to Kizyl-Arvat, Colonel Stoletof taking along with him, as on all occasions of his traversing the steppes, a party of ten to fifteen Tdkds of repute, together with their families and 500 of their camels. “ In the event “ 0 f the Tekes of Kizyl-Arvat falling back from the “ line of Kizyl-Arvat the Russian force was directed “ to lay waste all their lands, and to levy a con- “ tribution on them if they should give in their “ adherence to Russia.” Such were the measures adopted at this time in order to obtain a control of the supply of camels for the Khivan campaign, and “ these expeditions “ into the steppes were 'to be performed at various “ times until the opening of that campaign.” In the month of July 1871 Colonel Stoletof was succeeded by Colonel Markozof. The latter found that although it was possible to obtain about 1,000 camels for purposes of transport from among the Turcomans of the Caspian littoral, and principally from among those dwelling at the mouth of the ilttrek, yet that in some instances the tribes failed to fulfil their engagements in respect to bringing camels for hire to the camp,—a laxity which was not to be tolerated because of the bad example which it set; therefore Colonel Markozof sent out small military parties of soldiers to seize camels from the Turcomans by force. But by this means he only obtained 500. With these, as time pressed, Colonel Markozof conducted a reconnoissance to Sary-Kamysh, start ing from Mollah-Kari on the 8th (20th) of Sep tember, and returning on the 24th October (5th November). Soon after this Colonel Markozof made another reconnoissance, and at Topiatan on the 2nd (14th) November intercepted a Turcoman caravan of 350 camels. The merchandise was all “ sequestered ” and sent to the camp at Mollah-Kari, “for distribution among “ Russian Turcoman subjects.” All the camels were appropriated to the requirements of the mili tary service, with the exception of 20, which werehhkhhbhhhhhbh 15 1871 “ Operations of the Krasnovodsk and Mangyshlak detachments in 1871,” pp. 69 to 70.—“ Russian Millitary Journal,” April 1872. made over to certain Elders in the Russian camp who were devoted to the Russians. One hundred and twenty of these camels were found to belong to Yomuds of the Jaffarbai tribe, who were all reported as amicably disposed towards and obedient to Russia. The owners were informed that as their fellow tribesmen in various parts of the country had rendered services to Russia so should they, and that therefore their camels should be re tained for military purposes. This was a form of reprisal which cannot be said to have been justifiable on the part of a Power endeavouring to establish an authority “ for the “ purpose of safeguarding the trade routes, and of “ promoting commerce.” “ This measure,” however, as is said in the semi-official report, “ was dictated “ by the exigencies of the service, by the need felt “ by the Krasnovodsk column for means of trans- “ port for the contemplated march to the Attrek.” The expedition to the Attrek, leaving Mollah- Kari on the 13th (25th) of November, was under taken in concert with the Commodore at Ashurada, who had informed Colonel Markozof that there was a camp of about 10,000 tents of Yomuds near the Silver Mound (Gomush Tepd), among which people, the Commodore reported, it was commonly believed that the Russians would never venture to show themselves on the Attrek. This was an illusion which was to be dispelled, and a strong force was accordingly marched to the scene, where the Yomuds were to be taught a lesson, and where there was a prospect of securing a good booty in camels. Reaching Chikishlar on the 27th November (9th December), Colonel Mar kozof led his men (quietly and quickly) through the marshes to the banks of the Attrek, knee deep in water for a great distance, “ intending,” as the report said, “to take some aul by surprise, and to “ set fire to some 50 tents, a proceeding which, in “ the estimation of the natives, would neither have “ been cruel nor unjust,” because the Turcomans are accustomed to such raids, and make up their losses by retaliation. The various Turcoman tribes had repeatedly made friendly overtures to the Russian authorities, and had given strong proofs of their determination to abstain, if unmolested by the Russians, from all acts of hostility against them, and from marauding practices. Yet these overtures and protestations do not appear to have had any effect in modifying the course which Russia was following in respect to the tribes, and provoked as were the Tekes by the Russian invasion of Akhal in 1870, they stiil abstained from all attack on the Russian detach ment at Kizyl-Arvat, notw ithstanding the alleged fact that Nur-Yerdi, Khan of Akhal and Merv, had received 500 tomans from the Khan of Khiva to molest the Russians, and the tribes adhering to them. Even the Yomuds, as well as the Tekes, at this period, recorded their earnest request that theymight not he held responsible for the wicked deeds of evil minded members of their own fraternities, seeing, as they urged, that there was no country which had not its thieves and its robbers. They were finding from experience that the Russians were goading them to acts of hostility which would be charged against them as rebellion and which would afford plausible pretexts for promoting ex peditions and for subjugating all the tribes. This expedition to the Attrek was, however, a perfect failure ; the clans were forewarned and placed the swollen Attrek between them,* and the camel-hunting Russian force returned to Krasno- vodsk by sea from Chikishlar on the 10th (22nd) December, leaving their artillery (one “ division ”) and two companies of infantry “in garrison” in Fort Chikishlar. f The following, taken from the semi-official report of these operations, is of interest as, in a measure, explanatory of the entire policy of the Russian Government:— “ As was evidenced in the year 187.0, the Yomuds of the Jaffarbai clan were more amicably disposed towards our troops; negotiations in reference ex clusively to camels were opened with them, as also with the Attabai Yomuds and with the T6k&lt;$s, and the latter established trading relations with the force, with a view to discovering whether there was any intention on our part to march to Khiva. Another motive for this on the part of each of the Teke Elders was to persuade Colonel Markozof that the others had not that power to procure camels with which they were credited. Colonel Markozof made himself difficult of access to the Turcomans, receiving only those who had something of importance to communicate. “ On the first day of the Colonel’s reception of the Elders at Tash-Arvat-Kala, he explained to them that the sole object of the Russians was to establish commercial relations with the native population, and he strove most particularly to assure them that there was no cause for the appre hensions of the Turcomans, for that no expedition to Khiva was intended. The Elders begged that what the Colonel said might be put in writing; wherefore a translation into the Tartar tongue was made of his speech. “ One of these Turcoman Elders, Mollah Dundurt Khan, who was in the Russian pay, being a cause of embarrassment to Colonel Markozof, was re moved from the scene and sent to Tiflis to receive such reward as he might be deemed worthy of.” Il-Geldy-Khan, of the Jaffarbai Yomuds, was engaged, together with ten or fifteen others of his tribe, to ride about with Colonel Markozof, in order to show the Yomuds of Khiva and the other Tur comans of the country that the Jaffarbai clan had cast in their lot with Russia. Colonel Mar kozof engaged to pay each of these Turcomans five 1871. “ Operations of the Krasnovodsk and Mangyshlak detachments in 1871,” pp. 69 to 70.—•“ Russian Military Magazine,” April 1872. * Mention was made in some Russian papers of a skirmish with the Yomuds, and of an attack on Colonel Markozofs camp (Stumm, p. 84), but in the semi-official report here quoted, allusion is made only to a couple of shots said to have been fired at night into the Russian camp, one of which struck the Colonel’s tent, an occurrence for which the Colonel sought to make the tribe severely responsible; the strictest and most impartial inquiries failed, however, in dis covering the guilty men. f “ Markozof arrived at Chikishlar on the 1st (13th) December 1871, and immediately set about with the construction of a fort.”— Stumm’s “Russian Campaign against Khiva,” p. 84. “ Mr. Stremoukhof expressly stated,” in February 1872, “that there were no forts “ along the line of the Caspian to the Persian “ frontier, but those of Alexandrofsk and “ Krasnovodsk.”—Sir A. Buchanan to Earl Granville, 25th February 1872. f This man is again in Russian employ at Krasnovodsk, having recently caused several hundred Turcoman families to migrate from Khiva and settle near Krasnovodsk. “ Operations of the Krasnovodsk and Mangyshlak detachments in 1871.—“Rus sian Military Journal,” April 1872.1871. * Major Napier says that Il-Geldy was paid at a higher rate. 1872.

Ibid, pp. 16 and 92, “Russian Campaign against the Turco- mana.”—Marvin, p. 3. f It is not improbable that the Com- mander-in-Chief in the Caucasus had formed a plan of campaign against Khiva in which there should be no call for participation on the part of the Governor General of Tur kestan. It is this that may have dictated the policy of preliminary negotiations with Persia in respect to a Persian demonstration against the Tuicomaus of Akhal, with a view to a reliance on the resources of the oasis.—( Vide Stumm, pp. 86—88.)

For this reason Il-Geldy was allowed to visit his friends on the Attrek, whom he was enjoined to counsel not to decamp on the next friendly approach of the well-intentioned Rus sian force. Upon the termination of this series of expeditions Colonel Markozof reported that:— (!•) The formation of camps at Mollah Kari and Tash- Arvat-Kala in the Balkhans led only to a needless dispersion of the Krasnovodsk force, that the Balkhans were destitute of sufficient pastures and of fresh water, and that the Yomuds could not be made to cluster permanently or in any numbers in the neighbourhood. (2.) It was advisable to establish a place d’armes at the mouth of the Gurgan or at Chikishlar, where he had already erected a fort, and had left a garrison, from whence a force in co-operation with the naval authorities (Commander Petrichenko) at Ashurada might effectually coerce the Goklan and Yomud Turcomans, whose settlements extend to the Kara-Su, and from whence it would be com paratively easy to march up the Attrek into the coimtry of the Tekes. On the 7th January (New Style) Colonel Mar kozof arrived at Teheran, having been instructed by his Government secretly to apprise the Russian Minister at the Persian Court of the nature of the operations which were to be carried on in the year 1872, and to arrange concerted action between the military commander in the trans-Caspian country and the Russian Embassy at Teheran. Colonel Markozof alleged that one of the objects of his mission to Teheran was to prevail upon the Persian Government to send a force into the coun tries of the Attabai Yomuds and of the Tekes, in order to divert those people while he made the bold attempt of penetrating to Khiva by forced marches from the Caspian. The Persian Government did not, however, fall in with this scheme, and it was therefore determined that Colonel Markozof should alone carry war into Akhal, and from Fort Alexan- drofsk (on the Mangyshlak peninsula) push on to Khiva in the endeavour to seize that country by a coup-de-main. It was not the opinion of the Russian authoritiesf that the road to Khiva lay through Akhal or even through Kizyl-Arvat, the* extreme North-Western stronghold of the Tekds of that oasis. Accordingly, the combined forces, under Lomakin (from Fort Alexandrofsk), Markozof (from Chikishlar), and Stoletof (from Krasnovodsk), met at Topiatan in September, 4,000 strong, as announced by the Invalid, but, according to Captain Stumm, only 1,450, the several commanders having previously 6662. e» ricrformed separate reconnoisances, “ and t«™ed F&lt; the summer season to account for the collection “ ‘on^'caching Topiatan Colonel Markozof found an adiuTant from the Grand Duke awaiting him there with orders countermanding t^e jnarch to Khiva, “ and conveying instructions of , character” But his scouts informed him that there was a body of Turcomans some 30 miles farther up the ancient bed of tbe Oxus towards the last, amf accordingly Colonel Markozof determined upon “ taking the field against them, them at TJjamala, opened fire upon theni.kil mo , and taking 13 prisoners ; many dead and nounded were carried away by the nomads. . , . . At Igdy wells, still farther up the Uzboi (ancient bed of the Oxus), the Tekes who were “there ■“ encamped, ventured upon no hostilities against “ the approaching column, but peacefully sent to «&lt; the Colonel their Elders who assured him o « friendship of the tribe, begged for the restoration “of the prisoners, and in return promised to ® • i lip. m their Stumm, p. 92.

In fulfilment of the original design Colonel Markozof, after resting his troops three dajs at Iffdy, proceeded to Edzyl-Arvat. ^ n _ lieutenant Stumm, writing from official Prussian sources, and on the authority of his special in formant, Colonel Markozof, said that “the Colonel, « desiring to make one more and final attempt to « gain over the Turcomans by kindness and con- « fidence, delivered to them the prisoners captured “ at Uiamala, who moreover could only have been « a hindrance on the forward march in respect to « guarding and the great scarcity of water, and he « promised to spare their district and their mis “if they would in three days supply him with « 500 camels, of which there had begun to be a sensible scarcity owing to the great mortality. ^ Lieutenant Stumm continues to say that, “seeing that the Turcomans failed to appear (with the &lt;« camels) on the third day, as indeed was to he “ expected, Markozof marched with the detach- “ ment on the 19th (31st) October towards Kizyl- « Arvat to search for the false v and faithless « &lt;« Henvey’s Precis, 1872—75, “ The Russian Campaign against Khiva,’ Stumm, p. 93.1872.

On ‘ Markozofs approach the T6k6s again had re- “ course to the same tactics which they had pre- ' piously employed with success against Stolyetov. “ Taking their flocks, property, and goods, they hastened to abandon their dwelling places, and “ vanished into the steppes; Markozof, therefore, “ found Kyzyl-Aryat deserted by all its inhabi tants. TYithout losing time here, he continued “ tis march towards the so-called line of forts of “ the Tek£s southwards, and on the 26th-27th Oc- “ tober reached the principal mud fort, Bami, “ passing the strongholds Kara-Singer, Kaj, Zau, Kyzyl-Cheshme, and Yengi, and after success fully sustaining combats of greater or less im- “ portance with the md troops.* These places “ also had been deserted by their inhabitants, to “ whose panic the still smoking ashes on their hearths bore witness. The kibitkas were every- “ where given to the flames, in Bami alone over “ 1,000, and on the night of the 27th-28th Oc- “ tober the Russians arrived at Port Boerrna, which is the most esteemed among all the strong- “ holds of the Tekes. CKving to the speed of the “ Russian march the inhabitants had no longer “ found time for flight and had remained behind “ in their kibitkas. . . . These unfortunate f&lt; people deserted their habitations in the night “ time but when daylight dawned there was a hot “ pursuit.” Markozof, Stumm proceeds to say, “ had now “ attained his end, the chastisement of the Tek6s, c£ and could, without being disturbed, pursue and “ carry into execution his other plans on the “ Attrek.” After capturing Kari-Kala the Rus sian detachment proceeded in a southerly direction through Koshlyk-Chashma, TJila-Chaskma, TJya- T6pe, and Bayat-Hadji, following the courses * of the Sumbar and the Attrek to the sea, while the Colonel returned to Chikishlar by way of Karaul- T£pe, where he was greeted with the intelligence that the campaign against Khiva had at last been finally fixed for the spring of 1873, and he there fore at once took passage for Tiflis, arriving at that place on the 28th December 1872 (9th January 1873). J In the month of March of 1873 we find the Russian forces once more in hot pursuit of the Yomud-Turcomans. This time Colonel Markozof took a step which was calculated to be productive of camels, as well as to serve as a test of the temper of the Government of the Shah of Persia. As a preliminary to the preconcerted march to Khiva, the Russian detachment from Chikishlar boldly passed South of the mouth of the Attrek, and crossed the Gurgan river, and the only reason in justification of this unprovoked act, which was put forward by the Russian Government, was the general accusation against the Yomuds conveyed in the following vague, and in a great measureIf I * ss ^*n ~~-&gt; -'nfc-^y.-j 1 20 mendacious, explanation reproduced by the official Russian Invalid :— “ The constant raids of the Turcomans across the Attrek, to the right bank, and the losses con sequently sustained by our nomads compelled Colonel Markozof to give the tons-Attrek wbhers a more severe punishment, which should lake h ^ them all inclination to break into our territones. Moreover, the appearance beyond the Attrek. o Khivan agents produced agitation among the Chorva (the nomadising clans as distinguished from Chomur, the semi-sedentary tribes) who depastured to Khiva, in order to take part at the Khan s invi tation, in the hostilities against Russia. “ Jt was necessary to prevent this as much as possible, in order to obviate the complication of the difficulties attending the march of our expeditionary forces.” It was very essential that, for the camel remouni of the troops destined for Khiva, none of the tribes should evade Markozofs detachment, therefore, bavin 0, (C divided his force into three colomns, « Colonel Markozof crossed the Attrek at dawn on “ the 28th of February (12th March), intending to “ chastise the Turcomans camping between that « river and the Gurgan. The extreme left column “ was ordered to guard the extent of country t£ between the head waters of the Attrek, and “ Gurgan rivers, so as to intercept the nomads in that “ direction.”! Here between these tw r o rivers “ masses of Tur- “ coman horsemen ” were accordingly encountered, who, as it was reported, attacked the centre column. A discharge of artillery and musketry drove the tribes across the Gurgan, and the Yomuds were pur sued by the Russian detachment of foot, cavalry and artillery. The fact of the crossing of the Gurgan by the Russian force (noticed at the time in the Abstract quoted in the margin) has been quite over looked. “ It was reported from Astrabad, in March “ 1873, that a Russian detachment of 200 soldiers “ and 50 Cossacks, with two guns, had crossed the “ Attrek,” without stating in terms that the Gur gan had been crossed, although in the same report it was mentioned that the Russian detachment “ had marched into the Gurgan districts, occupied “ by the Zaffarbaee tribes, to the encampment of “ Kurreem-Khan, the Chief of the Attabae Yomud “ Turcomans, situated within eight miles of the “ town of Astrabad.Colonel Markozof thus “ cleared the country between the Attrek and the “ Gurgan,” and “ inflicted a very material loss on “ the Turcomans.” In the report above quoted it was stated that “ Kurreem-Khan and some of the elders of his “ tribe were taken prisoners by the Russians, while “ the officer in command of the detachment was “ said to have seized the opportunity to secure and carry off with him a large 1873.

Nothing more in this region was undertaken until the spring of 1874. Colonel Lomakin as sumed the command of the trans-Caspian forces in November 1873, when on arriving at Krasnovodsk he addressed letters and sent emissaries to all the Turcoman tribes from Krasnovodsk to Merv, and to the Gurgan. He announced to all those people that he was authorized by the brother of the Emperor (the Grand Duke Michael, Viceroy of the Caucasus), to claim their allegiance and obedience as subjects of Russia, and he summoned all the head men of Akhal and of the Gurgan and Attrek regions to appear before him, appointing the time and place for their gathering. In the meantime Colonel Lomakin elaborated a pioject foi the organization of a separate governor ship in the trans-Caspian region, which should be subordinate to the Viceroy of the Caucasus. The report was forwarded from Krasnovodsk through the Grand Duke Michael in December 1873, having been preceded by a recommendation submitted to the Emperor by the Grand Duke in November 1873, for the conversion of the steppe region East of the Caspian into a military section of the mili tary circuit of the Caucasus. The result of this was the Ukaz, dated 9th (21st) March 13/4, which ran as follows:— “ The trans-Caspian country, within the lim from Mertvi-Kultuk Bay to the Attrek (the fr 6662 . pi tier line between Russia and Persia), and from the East coast of the Caspian to the estern frontier of the Khanat of Khiva, shall, in military and ad ministrative respects, compose a trails-Caspian military section of the military circuit of the Caucasus. This section shall comprise the ishm off the East coast down to that of Ogurchmsk in clusive. The officer in charge of the admimstia- tion of this military section shall also as o ffi cer commanding the troops therein, and shall be ap pointed or removed from his post by Imperial The TJkaz in question traced the limits ot tins section of the military circuit of Caucasus «from Mertvi-Kaltuk Bay to the Attrek (the “ frontier line between Russia and Persia), and “ from the East coast of the Caspian to the IT estern “ frontier of Khiva,” and leaving the East frontier undefined as an open question, did not restrict the Military Governor to an authority oyer any par ticular tribe or tribes of the nomad Turcomans understood to be subjects of Russia; therefore the Moscow Gazette explained that “ properly selected * f officers, exercising a direct influence over the ' population, would be untrammelled by paper « formalities.” The St. Petersburg Gazette went further, entering into a minute exposition of the plan of administration, observing as follows, in reference to Lord Granville’s Despatch of the /th January 187L on the subject of the embarrassing position of the Amir of Afghanistan m the event f an y Russian attempt to subjugate the lurco- raans : “ The recent enactment or regulation states &lt;&lt; plain terms that the trans-Caspian region, « which forms part of the military circuit of the « Caucasus, extends southwards to the river Attrek « and eastwards to the frontiers of the Khanat ot « Khiva. As by the latter frontier must be under- “ stood the limits of the settled population of that « Khanat, inasmuch as at the conclusion of peace « w ith Khiva in 1873 it had become evident that &lt;&lt; fim Turcomans 'were completely independent of « Khan of Khiva, the whole mass of the Turco- « m an population is, therefore, now included witldn « the political limits of the Russian Empire. This paper further added The regulation contains « an explanatory clause to the effect that the tent « f tax leviable from the Turcomans of the Kras- u novodsk district will be imposed ^ proportionately ** to the degree of their submission to Russian &lt;e protection and authority. This clause must be « understood to mean that, while abstaining from « immediate occupation of the ichole of the Turco- « man steppe, the Russian Government reserve to ft themselves liberty of action as regards the establish-' tf ment of tranquillity and civil organization among a the Turcomans occupying territories down to the ' 'torders of Afghanistan.” Masking her designs, and desirous of accumu- ?ng grievances against the Turcoman tribes, in QtJ4° gain a pretext for a final blow at the 1874.

Abstract, No. CIL Tek4s, the Russian Goyemment declined the offer made by the Shah to participate in any expedition against the Turcomans, giving as a reason that it was impossible to say from which quarter the Turcomans were likely to molest or to attack Russian troops or subjects, and so provoke an im mediate counter attack. There is no single Russian authority, from Baron de Bode andM. de Khanikof down to the present time, who, in writing on Persia and the Turcomans, has not asserted that the Kara-Su forms the real fron tier line of Persia. “ The Russian Government,’* according to the Persian Minister in London, “ had “ refused (in 1874) to admit that the Attrek formed ' the boundary of the two countries, but declared “ the frontier to be on the Kara-Su,”* so that the formal repudiation of the Attrek boundary by General Lomakin was in perfect accordance with the long established Russian view of the cir cumstance, and in operating as he did from the first upon the Turcomans of the Gurgan, he acted in consonance with the TJkaz of the 9th (21st) March 1874, on the organization of a trans-Caspian military circuit, which, interpreted hy the St. Petersburg Gazette, implied the absorption of the entire mass of the Turcoman population within the political limits of Russia. The incorporation of this region under the Ukaz of 1874 gave Russia an extension of territory over ten degrees of latitude and eight of longitude,f 281,898*1 square versts, or 5,826*17 square German geographical miles. How far, under the regulations issued with the TJkaz, the chief of this new “ military section ” was to extend the Russian jurisdiction to the South and East cannot be ascertained without a reference to those regulations, which were lengthy and elabo rate, as is to be inferred from the comments made upon them by the Russian press, but Lomakin, now promoted to the rank of General, assumed that he was vested with authority to caution all the Turcoman tribes of Akhal and of the Gurgan against disobedience to his mandates, and against disturbances or rebellion. He first summoned the Elders of the tribes in the vicinity of Krasnovodsk, and through them con vened a great gathering in the spring of 1874, when the Persian Yomuds of the Gurgan and the Tekes of Akhal were in the habit of moving upwards with their flocks from the South. This was a favourable time of the year to address a multitude of mixed Persian and Russian subjects and Tekds on Russian territory, on which all were alike considered tribu taries of the Empire. The first grand assembly was held at Krasno vodsk, in the month of Eebruary, every arrange ment being made to render the occasion a solemn and an impressive one. General Lomakin, on ing at Krasnovodsk after a temporary absence hailed with acclamations by the Russian g and residents, among whom the Turcoman“Russian pay were conspicuous by their servile demonstrations. A religious ceremony was performed, after which, according to the Hussion report, both the Jaffarbai and Attabai Turcomans,* through their repre- sentative , declared that “ they were fully assured “ that the Russians had established themselves for {i ever in the trans-Caspian region; that they could “ not oppose the Russians; that they themsel\es “ had no other country to fall back upon, and were “ consequently convinced that it was only by an ** unconditional obedience to the Russians that “ their own happiness could be secured. They ' accordingly tendered their humble submission to the Russian Government, and prayed the Com- “ mander-in-Chief of the Caucasus, the brother ol “ the Great Agha-Padishah, to accept their alle giance and to take them under his merciful 44 protection.” Furthermore, the official Russian report from Krasnovodsk recorded again the grievances said to have been brought by the Yomud representatives against the Tek&amp;s and the Kurds. In the months of April and June, there were other and larger gatherings on Cheleken island, at Gomush Tep6, and (of Gurgan Yomuds exclusively) at Ashurada, when certain T4kes of Akhal are alleged to have presented themselves before the Russian General, together with all the others, in answer to the summons previous sent to them by “ trusty messengers.” From the report published in the Kavkaz, it appears that the Tekd spokesmen on these occasions were “ only messengers ” from the Khans, bearing a letter signed by Sofi Khan and others, in which they are said to have ex pressed their “ readiness to fulfil all the General’s “ desires, instructions and commands.” According to Kazi-Said Ahmed, the Astrabad Agent, General Lomakin paid a visit to Astrabad in June 1874, where he was cordially entertained by the Governor General of Khorassan, who was there at the time, and addressed a meeting of Persians, saying:— “ We are ready to assist you whenever it may )e necessary; we are ready, as we have 21,000 /Foops. We have no motive but friendship and unity. We do not want the produce of this plain. All we want is to preserve order. Many things are said among the Turcomans, but as they are ignorant of the real objects in view, all such state ments are groundless. We hope that you (the Governor General) will also take measures for the protection of this plain.” The same Agent later forwarded a Persian translation of the General’s speech, which ran as rsian Government officers and subjects. Be n to you that there is a great amity and p between your Government and ours, and I * The latter, it is to be noted, have always remained subjects of Persia. Musa-Khan, an Attabai Elder, was bought over by the Russians and repudiated by his fellow tribesmen. (Napier’s Journal.) The spokesman for the Jaffarbai was Ani- Vali Khan.

The reason why we have taken possession of this sahra (plain) is, that whilst we protect you against the rauk of the Yomuds, we should proceed to the Teke country and take vengeance on them for the damages they have caused to your Government when llashmat-ood-dowlah invaded YLerv, and at the same time restore peace and tranquillity tmoughout Hussian Turkistan, and achieve many other objects, &amp;c.” It it was the fact that the Russian troops at Chikishlar and at Krasnovodsk in the year 1874 numbered 21,000 men of ail arms, as was stated by General Romakin, then indeed the Russians were more formidable in the trans-Caspian region than lias ever been supposed, and this would in a great measure account for the great influence which the Russians wielded among the Turcoman tribes. In the month of July 1874, the Kavkas reported upon the perfect tranquillity prevailing in the region incorporated under the TJkaz oi the 9th (21st) March of the same year, saying that “ dele- “ gates from the various tribes presented themselves dailv ith protestations of devotion and submis sion that “ at a word from the chief of the district, the tribes had liberated their male and female slaves in the name of God, and because “ they had heard that sucli was the desire of the Great Izar, and that “ they had also signed an ' undertaking to submit without a murmur to all the regulations affecting them during their “ sojourn in -the trans-Caspian district.” But at the same time the Kuvkaz dwelt ominously on the misbehaviour of the Tekes, mixing up their relations with the Kurds and with the Yomuds of the Gurgan with alleged forays within the limits of the Russian district, and with a reported attack on a Russian caravan from or to Astrabad, and on the leke “ envoys ” who had been to Krasnovodsk with tenders of friendship and obedience. The real cause of irritation on the part of the Russian authorities expressed itself at the same time in the following phrase :— Those alone (of the Tekes) who occupy the ten torts nearest to us are ready to submit to us.*' Lomakin’s wns the period of “mild and per suasive measures,” as compared with the period ot “ stringent measures,” resorted to by Colonel Markozof, and as will be found further it was a period of military scouring expeditions “ carried out m a most amicable spirit?' The following notification was made in October 1874 three companies of infantry were to be sent early in October (1874) to Chikishlar by sea. From Chikishlar they were to have orders to proceed up the Attrek to Hadji-Bayat-Olum, where they 6662. G26 will stay until December next, keeping a watch over the Yomud and Teke Turcomans.” And further (Turkestan Gazetteer), that. ^ ‘‘ General Lomakin, commanding trans-Caspian, intends to pacify the Tek6 Turcomans by means ot three military expeditions; one starting irom Ckikishlar to the Attrek, and another from Michael Bay to the Little Balkhan Hills. “ General Lomakin considers that these measuies will awe the Turcomans, for the Bussian column will advance from 100 to 200 versts towards the Teke forts, which will show the Turcomans that the Russian troops can, at all times, come suddenly upon them in their encampments.” Lord Augustus Loftus informed Her Majesty s Government that General Lomakin had decided on a “small” expedition against theT6k6Turcomans but, referring later to this matter, Lord A. Loftus observed that these military plans were projected at a date (February) “anterior to the late instructions “ forwarded to the Grand Duke Michael by express ' orders of the Emperor,” which orders were in prohibition of any military expedition. It was thrmigh Mr. Thomson that Her Majesty s Government was apprised of the Russian occupation of “ Bvat-i-Haji,” on which occasion “ the Russians “ advanced without opposition through the pastures of the Yomuds, from whom they got camels and &lt;£ all needful aid.” And it was through the same channel that lier Majesty’s Government were informed of the Russian occupation of the fort of Karri-Kala,* a place tributary to Persia since 1869 (1860 ?). In the beginning of July it was publicly an nounced that General Lomakin had started on the 1st of June, with three battalions of infantry and some Cossacks, on an expedition, to meet a force under General Ivanof from the Oxus, which was a crain striking terror into the turbulent bands of Teke and other Turcomans, and that, on his way back. General Lomakin would erect a few small forts! The forts which he intended to erect were not alone along the line of the old bed of the Oxus, between Krasnovodsk and Khiva, but also in the Attrek valley; but allusion to this was not made until after the termination of the expedition. It was given out that the sole object to be accomplished on this occasion was the exploration of the old bed of the Oxus, but the Russian Invalid raised a war cry against the Teke Turcomans in the following proclamation:— “ The turbulent Turcoman tribes are not amenable to our influence; protected by surrounding deserts, proud in their independence, and considering them- ■selves unconquerable, seeing that all former attempts made by Persia, Khiva and Bokhara to subdue them have been unavailing, the Tdkds have assumed a defiant attitude towards Russia.

The Khiva expedition has ^iven security to trade with Kazalinsk and Orenburg, but the Ox us oasis is isolated from all commercial rela tions with Bokhara and with the countries alon' the coast of the Caspian, since the intermediate terri tories arc domineered over exclusively by the numerous Tekes.” ' Ihis publication, in a journal notoriously sub servient to the Viceroy of the Caucasus, was equivalent to a declaration of war against the Tekes. The Tek^s, as mere hangers on to the skirts of Persia, were not a people covered in any strict sense by international agreement, yet some such declaration, prior to any operation against them which should draw universal attention, was more or less necessary, and failing any possibility or probability of a confutation of general allega tions of the all round culpability of the Turcomans, a general accusation was doubtless deemed sufficient to justify any operation which the Russian autho rities were inclined to prosecute against them. The case made out agaiost the Tek&amp;s was ex ceedingly weak, but weak or otherwise, there was no other besides Russian authority which could dispute it. •» The Invalid proceeded as follows, in palliation, as it w r ere, of the course about to be pursued in the face of the assurances given to the British Govern ment by the Emperor:— Ihe English press, as our readers are already aware, understand equally well that the key to tranquillity in the Turcoman steppes, as in all Central Asia, is to be found at Merv. The English now recognize the necessity of curbing the feke Turcomans, a necessity vffiich became evident during the Khiva campaign. It has long been Merv, that the present condition of affairs cannot be suffered to last. The most convenient road to Merv leads from the Caspian up the Attrek river, along the Kurren- dagh mountains. It is evidently from this direction that the T&lt;$kes expect an attack. The Elders of the T6k6 Turcomans presented themselves to General Lomakin at the Igdy Wells, and announced that it had been resolved at a council of the headmen not to enter into hostilities against the Russians, and to deliver up all captives. These declarations made to the Russians of Krasnovodsk do not, however, in terfere with the kidnapping of Russians of Tash- kend, or with the commission of raids into the territories of the Khan of JChiva, the vassal of Russia.” The topographical survey of the Upper Uzboi having been completed, General Lomakin returned to Krasnovodsk, and after a short rest marched his force to Chikishlar, w r here he was reinforced from Baku.&lt;« Notwithstanding the order given hy the Emperor to the Grand Duke Michael to discontinue^ all aggressive movements in the neighbourhood o Mcrv, His Imperial Highness forwarded to ic Russian Minister of War a report, m which he ur^ed upon him the necessity of undertaking a mUitarv expedition (to consist of 2,000 men, iom guns, and a rocket battery) to scour the country between the Balkan mountains and the Attrek, but to be carried out in a 1 most amicable spirit; and this proposed expedition was approved by the Emperor of Russia when at Ems, on the 2nd June 1875 ” In the month of July General Lomakin was reported by the Mission Agent at Astrabad to have passed Kizyl-Arvat with 5,000 men,* a report which was subsequently confirmed by the Meshed Agent, who learned that “the Russians intended to attack “ the Merv and Akhal Turcomans in the^ ensuing “ winter, and that the expedition against the « former would proceed by way of Charjui on the “ Oxus.”t With reference to the expected advance to Merv, Baron Jomini referred Mr. Doria at this time to the Emperor’s prohibition of such a thing, observing, at the same time, that as the Tekes had manifested to General Lomakin “ increased submissiveness, an “ attack on Merv was rendered less necessary.” On the occasion of this^ expedition, General Lomakin revisited Bayat-Haji and Chat, at which places he erected forts; he also explored the upper portions of the Sumbar and Attrek valleys up to Rari-Kalu, returning, by way of Chikishlar, to Krasnovodsk in October, after an absence of more than four months. The “ usual campaign” in the Turcoman steppes was resumed in the summer of 1876, when General Lomakin marched to Nukus, near Kuhna Urgandj, in Khiva, but no military expeuMon seems to have been undertaken towards Akhal. This period was marked by the negotiations entered into by the Tekes of Merv and Akhal with Persia and Afghanistan for a protectorate over them, and by the great activity of the Russian authorities in making preparations for a fresh cam paign against the Akhal-Teke Turcomans in the spring of 1877.

The Russians now found all the Tekes of Akhal up in arms against them; those of Mery having warned the Akhalese that if they did not repel the Russians the entire race would ultimately be annihilated. General Lomakin reported that, “ e stirred up by e mol) alis and others who have recently returned IC c from Mecca, all the remoter Turcomans* have “ ‘ passed a resolution either to annihilate our small ‘ detachment, or to die in the attempt, and as the “ ‘ Koran enjoins, not to cede a clod of their earth “ ‘ without a struggle.’ ” “ The Turcomans were led by that same Nur- “ Verdy-Khan, who had been considered to be the “ head of the Russian party.” At a short distance from Kizyl-Arvat the Russian force was attacked by a large body of Turcomans deploying from out of the Alchi Ata defile. The Russian report estimated their number at 6,000, with a reserve body of 4,000. Although kept at bay for some time, the Turco mans pressed hard upon the Russians on all sides, and the result of this expedition was a signal failure, although at Teheran this encounter was represented by the Russian Minister in the light of a Russian victory, on the strength of which he raised the question of a Russian claim to Kari- Kalla and Nukhur, a question which, regarding it now retrospectively, seemed to have been raised merely in anticipation of a contemplated plan of fresh operations in the ensuing year. It is much to be regretted that when this ques tion was raised there existed only one version of the issue of the conflict at Kizyl-Arvat, because there were indeed ample grounds for strong protests against a prosecution of the Russian design to carry war into the midst of a people who, far from having given them any provocation, had done much to mollify them, and who, moreover, had but recently been formally constituted Persian feudatories and allies, and whom the Shah had taken under his protection. But in this matter of Kari-Kala and Nukhur, as in others on critical emergencies, there was that absolute lack of influence with the Shah in the only quarter from which such influence, if wielded, would most probably have been salutary and effec tive, as it would have been even welcome to His Highness, as well as to his Ministers. The Tekes, it was said, lost 200 killed, and after four hours’ fighting on the 12th of May, they “took to flight;” and it w r as further alleged in the Russian report, that three days later the Khans of Kizyl-Arvat, Kodja, Zau, Pengi and Kizyl- Cheshma came into camp, saying, “ Consider our “ forts are yours; we submit to you, and are “ willing to follow^ all your instructions.” There was no corroboration of this from As- trabad, Teheran, or Meshed; on the contrary, according to the evidence of Major the Honourable G. C. Napier, all the Akhal-Tek4 clans regarded the Russians with strong aversion, maintaining30 relations with Persia, while the people of Kari- Kala showed a hold front to Russia, and tuinec appealingly towards the Shah. According to the Kavkas, General Lomakin « commenced a hurried retreat to Krasnovodsk on “ the 9th June.” a The heat was terrible,” wrote the correspon dent of that journal. 44 In six days, however, we “ marched about 200 versts across the desert, “ coming to a halt at Mollah-Kari well, within « 140 versts of Krasnovodsk. Here we lost a &lt;£ rrreat many camels, and the carcasses oi these “ beasts infected the air and increased the number “ of our sick, who were sent in large parties to “ Krasnovodsk camp. We returned into camp at “ Krasnovodsk on the 11th (23rd) of July, after a “ whole month’s sojourn at Mollah-Kari. The retreat of General Lomakin from Krasno vodsk was not, as is implied in Plowden’s Precis, a sudden withdrawal in consequence of the declara tion of war between Russia and Turkey, what” ever connection the Generals summons to riiiis mav have had with that event, for instead oi a relaxation of efforts on the East coast oi the Cas pian, preparations were immediately set on foot for retrieving the loss of prestige sustained by i ic reverse. The plan of the Russian trans-Caspian operations in the year 1878 was laid on the lines of General Khruleffs project of an 44 expedition to Afghan- 44 istan for the purpose of overthrowing the English 44 rule in India.’ 44 In the first place,” so ran that project, we 44 must hold a fort with a garrison of 3,000 men 44 between the Kara-Su and Gurgan rivers, at a 44 distance of H versts irom Asti abaci, anu of 44 20 versts from the Caspian, on the ruins of Ak- 44 Kala fort, in a locality peopled by Turcomans, 44 and favoured with a healthy climate, and with 44 extensive forests of trees suitable for buildings 44 and boats. This garrison can aid in checking 44 the piracy of the Turcomans on the Caspian, and 44 keep open our communication with the trans- 44 Caspian region. . . . This new fort will be 44 of advantage to Persia in protecting Astrabad 41 against any attack by Turcomans.”! General Khrulef evidently regarded the Kara- Su as the frontier; and here, immediately after the Crimean war, were the indications of that policy, which has been pursued East of the Caspian along the northern borders of Khorassan. 44 Prom Ak-Kala troops can reach Teheran in 44 15 days, and Herat (Afghanistan) in 35 days.” Ak-Kala, on the Gurgan, which may have been a ruin in 1856, was not a ruin in 1873, when Markazof unexpectedly came upon it on his way back after having crossed the Gurgan.

Another “ recommendation was the fortifying and enlarge- “ ment of Krasnovodsk as a military and naval “ station, making it the chief depot and base of a “ Russian expeditionary force. The Russian Go- u vernment acted at once on the above recommen- “ dations. The garrisons in Turkestan were “ strengthened. General Von Kaufmann was “ provided with funds for the reorganization of the “ militia, and Krasnovodsk was so changed in the “ course of the year that travellers were surprised &lt;f to see the alterations that had been made. Rive e( commissions composed of staff officers were “ simultaneously despatched in various directions “ between the Russian and Anglo-Indian dominions, “ the results of which have been a better acquaint- “ ance with many unknown parts of Central Asia, “ and a circumstantial plan of military operations. “ This plan was approved by the Russian Minister “ for War in the autumn of the year 1877, and it “ is on the strength of this plan that all those “ movements are being made in Central Asia which. “ have been noticeable of late.” Abstract, No. XXIV., July 1878. Accordingly, preparations were made at Tiflis in the spring (April) of 1878, for an “ expedition with “ a purpose more serious than the curbing of “ Turcomans and an advance on Merv.” Abstract, No. XUII., October 1878, and The force, under cover “ partly of cavalry and No. LVII., November 1878. “ partly of Cossacks, of Kirghiz, of local militia “ and 'even of several pieces of ordnance,” left Krasnovodsk on the 22nd July for Chat. Passing up the Chandyr and Sumbar tributaries of the Attrek, the column advanced to Bend Essen, and crossed the ridge of the Kopet Dagh to Bami, looking down upon the oasis of Akhal. . Abstract, No. LXX., December 1876. Lomakin’s force was estimated at SOOinen wither- 24 guns. The Kavkas stated that the force was a “ rather large one,” and “it was concluded that the “ object of the expedition was the long looked “for occupation of the Akhal Tekd oasis. It “ was also considered that the advance oi the “ Krasnovodsk column was in connection with the “ movements of General Kaufmaun’s Turkestan “ troops.” Having scanned the oasis from the top of the32 pass, and having had, as it would appear, only a brush with the Tekes, the column marched back to Chat, pursued by the enemy (September), where Lomakin built a strong fort. In March .1879 we heard of a concentration of 20,000 Russian troops at Baku, under General Lazaref, and of a Russian force having marched to Charjui, and in the month of May it was announced that General Lazaref was on his way from Tiflis to 'Baku to take command of the expedition against the Tek6s. It is not the object of this paper to describe the Russian military operations against the Tekes, and the particulars of the campaign are sufficiently well known; moreover, it was now no longer a question of intrusion on the part of the Russians in the country in which they were opera ting. It will be sufficient to observe that General Lazaref died on the 27th August (O.S.) at Chat, and General Lomakin assumed the command of the main body. On the 28th of August the Russians were repulsed by the Tekds at Dengil Tepe, and were obliged to fall back upon Bedrma, and in the month of October the entire force crestfallen returned to Chikishlar. The campaign conducted in 1880 by General Skobelef is still more fresh in our memory. The railway which was laid from Michael Bay to Kizyl-Arvat was not completed in time for General* Skobelef to avail himself of it for purposes of transport. It was finally opened only in September 1881. The Akhal Teke oasis was formally annexed to Russia by TJkaz of the 6th (18th) May 1881, which was as follows :— “ Oukase de Sa Majeste VEmpereur au Senat Dirigeant. il Ayant jug6 utile, en vue de eonsolider la tranquillity et la s^curite dans les steppes trans- Caspiennes, d’annexer i\ TEmpire le territoire des Turcomans-Tekes oecup6 par nos troupes, nous ordonnons, savoir:— “ II est forme, avec ce pays ct la contree de la section militaire de la trans-Caspienne, un seul territoire, sous le nom de ‘ territoire de la trans- Caspienne,’ qui est incorpore dans la conscription militaire du Caucase.

I am informed, on good Russian authority, that the group of General and other Staff officers, standing at the extreme eastern point of the frontier agreed upon between Russia and Persia, clearly discerned Sarakhs. Liciitenant-Gciieml Rehrberg was appointed Military Governor of the new region, with Colonel Baron Aminof as chief of his staff, and Colonel Heintz as chief of the artillery. Askhabad was made the centre of the Russian administration. . trans-Caspian region has been divided into districts as follows :— 1. Geok-Tepe, including the extent of country from Bami to Askhabad; chief town Askhabad. 2. Attrek, from Chikishlar to Bami; with Duz- Olum as the chief town. 3. Krasnovodsk, composed of the prefectures of Krasnovodsk and Mangyshlak, extending in one direction to Alexandrofsk, and in the other to Bami; chief town, Krasnovodsk. In the month of December 1881,* Mr. Zinovief, the Russian Minister at Teheran, and Mirza* Said- Khan, the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, signed a convention defining the Russo-Persian frontier. According to the Russian official Gazette, this frontier runs up the Attrek to Chat, and from that point in a North-Easterly direction along the crests of the mountains and up the course of the Sumbar affluent of the Attrek. “ On reaching the valley “ of the Baba-Durmaz stream, the frontier passes “ to the North, intersecting the road leading from “ Gawars to Lufti-Abad.” Thus the extreme Eastern point of the Russian frontier is shown to be between 140 and 145 miles distant from Sarakhs. The Russian official Gazette explains further that Russia has contented herself with the retention of the Akhal oasis, and with the slopes of the mountains which screen that oasis on the South, so that from the Sumbar river the frontier trends mainly along the crests of the mountains, leaving the Firuze district to Persia. t Gotos, Abstract, No. V., February 1882. According to one Russian versionf a portion of the country conterminous with the above line of frontier, ,viz., the Atak region, is by virtue of the above convention, left to Persia only for five years, during which period the Persian Government have undertaken to levy no taxes in the above region.PART II. The Turcomans in relation to Afghanistan and Persia. Home Correspondence, November and December 1873, p. 719. * I was myself assured at St. Petersburg in 1873 by the late Mr. Grigorief that mis understandings with all the Turcoman tribes would soon be provoked by the authorities of the Caucasus. Mr. Grigorief said that as the several Turcoman tribes were but so many links in one chain, Russia would inevitably become involved in attempts to subjugate the entire race, when Russian troops would pursue those people even to the walls of Herat. I wrote home on this subject, and 1 mentioned the fact that Mr. Grigorief, calling upon my brother, earnestly requested us both to endeavour to persuade our Government to do something to prevent the fresh com plications which would arise from the deploy ment of the army of the Caucasus in the trans- Caspian region, on the northern confines of Persia.—R.

The first Turcoman tribe which was all but utterly crushed by the Russian forces was that of the Yomuds of Khiva, whose encampments on the southern confines of that Khanat were broken up during the operations in Khiva in 1873, the tribe being ruined and dispersed, and forced to pay a heavy contribution in money. It was reported by Her Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg that the Governor General of Orenburg had expressed an opinion to the effect that this exasperation of the Yomuds by General Golovachef would inevitably lead to operations against the Tekes of Merv.* This was foreseen by the Tdkes who had begun to experience the effects and to comprehend the ultimate object of the annual Russian reconnoissances and expeditions into the steppes from Krasnovodsk and Chikishlar, and they had accordingly applied to Persia and to Cabul for counsel and aid. The T4k4 Turcomans were in negotiation with Afghanistan so far back as in 1867 and 1869, when Baba-Khan, the son of Kaushid-Khan of Merv, attended on the Amir at Cabul with 300 horsemen.f Twice in the year 1873 Baba-Khan was sent to Cabul and to Herat with requests for aid against the threatening advance of the Russians, and with offers of allegiance; this had such a disturbing effect on the mind of the Amir of Afghanistan that he called the attention of the Government of India to the matter, which circumstance opened the door to a correspondence on the subject between the British and Russian Governments. On the apprehensions of the late Amir being represented to the Russian Government, M. de Westmann referred the British Ambassador to the massacre by the Turcomans of Persians liberated,, and on their Tvay from Khiva to Persia. This attack on the Persian caravan was made by the ruined and houseless Yomuds who had been driven into the desert during the Khivan cam paign and who had no means of sustenance ; the alleged massacre in no way supplied a case against the Tekes. Apprehending a Russian advance on Merv and Akhal from Khiva, in the year 1873 Kaushid Khan Teke applied to Ameen-ud-dowleh, the Jamshidi Chief of Herat, for leave to bring the Teke cattle into his province. Even the Saryk and Salor Turcomans on the Murghab river, and far in the rear of the Tekds, agitated at the prospect of the Russian invasion, made representations to the Afghan authorities at Herat and to the Meers of Afghan Turkistan, asking either for advice or for a safe asylum in the event of a falling back of the Tek6s, who confronted the Russians. It was announced in the Russian Turkestan Gazette, that the Teke Turcomans had offered their submission to the Russian Government through36 General Ivanof, and it was stated in the Russian Military Journal for September 1874,* that a party of Sarvk Turcomans of Merv did indeed cross the desertand offer allegiance to General Yon Kaufmann in Khiva in 1873.f In the autumn (October) of the year 187o, Colonel Lomakin made two unsuccessful attempts to bribe the Teke Turcomans of Akhal to an acknowledgment of Russian supremacy over them, and even failed in an attempt to make the Yomuds round about Chat to sign a paper to the same effect. In the early part of the year (1876) the late Kaushid-Khan, chief of Merv, again sent his son to Herat with friendly overtures in anticipa tion of a Russian invasion of Akhal and Merv, and with offers of an alliance with the Amir of Cahul, which the latter was inclined to accept. J Although certain Elders of all the various Turco man tribes between Merv and the Caspian did, indeed, pledge themselves on different occasions to the furtherance of the interests of Russia, yet the bulk of the people have invariably shown themselves eagerly desirous of either a Persian or Afghan pro tectorate on grounds entirely independent of those of religious faith, and they have repudiated those who were made under certain inducements to speak on their behalf. The attempts which the Turco mans of Akhal anil Merv have made to place themselves either under Persia or Afghanistan since General Lomakin’s proclamation and se ductive efforts to strenuous and sincere. The proffers ol submission to Russia mane to General' Lomakin and to other Russian officers commanding in the trans-Caspian region cannot be taken as pledges of the obligations of the tribesmen, otherwise it might be said that the Russian conquest of Akhal was simply a justifiable quelling of a re bellion, as anticipated in General Lomakin’s pro clamation of 1874. As Colonel Handevil iu 1859 allured many of the Yomud Chiefs by means of bribes and regular pay, so also did Colonels (now Generals) Stoletof! and YEarkozol in 1869, and General Lomakin in 18/4, establish by the same means a long list of Turcoman adherents to Russia, such as Musa Khan, of the Attabai Yomuds, and Tykma Sardar, of Akhal and Merv. In the spring of the year 1874, General Lomakin employed twenty agents of this class, sending them about to summon the tribesmen; he also wrote letters to the more distant Turcomans and to all the Yomuds. The agents “ promised to pre- “ yail upon all the leading men among the Yomuds “ to present themselves to the General at Kras- novodsk, feeling confident that they would do so, “ and would even solicit the gracious protection of the Emperor of Russia.” According to the Russian account from the Kav- kas, the representative^ of all the Yomuds, Attabai as well as Jaffarbai (and from the country between the Attrek and the Gurgan), paid their respects to the General and offered humble submission and * “ On the Turcomans and Kirghizes of Khiva,” by the interpreter attached to the Russian forces in Khiva in 1873. f This party numbered 16 men, all Saryks, among them were Khan-bey, Murad-Sardar, Muhomed-Niaz-bek, Saghat-bey, Araz-Geldy- bey, Araz, and Tashbek. They came to Khiva by way of Sirab, Yaradji and Takht, striking the Ox us atKabakly (Kukertli), and were 15 days en route. Letter from India, No. 2 of 1876.

It is not to be overlooked that, in the representa tions which all the Yomud Turcomans are said, in the Russian accounts, to have made, reference occurs to their molestation, not alone by the Tekes but also by the Kurds of Persia, among whom, they ^ god, oOO of their orethren lingered in slavery, whose release the Russian Government was en treated to effect. The Kavkas also noted the fact that the repre sentatives of the Turcomans camping South of the Attrek on the Caspian coast assured General Ko- makin that for the last thirty years, ever since the establishment of the Russian naval station at Asharada, their people had considered themselves practically Russian subjects and were always ready to obey the commands of the Russian Tsar. On the 2nd (14th) of April 1874, two Yomuds were despatched by General Lomakin with letters addressed to the Teke Khans and Aksakals, and to all the notabilities of that tribe of Turcomans. This, according to the Kavkas, was all that Russia could do to bring the Tdkds to terms by pacific means. The reply received from the Tekes of Akhal* was a favourable one, the representatives of that people declared a willingness to serve Russia and to they Russian orders, and they likewise prayed for Russian protection against the Kurds of Persia and against the Goklan tribe of Turcomans.-)* Rut the Tekes were charged with co-operation with the Khivans in 1878, and General Lomakin, in sending “trust worthy ” messengers to Akhal, had the twofold object of securing a future claim to the allegiance of the Tek&amp;s and of “ obtaining information of what “ was going on in the steppes and of the temper “ of the nomad population,’’ with a view to future “ contingencies. Ever since the Russian occupation of Krasno- vodsk, and perhaps more particularly since the Russian expedition to Khiva coupled with the hostile operations against the Yomuds, the Russian autho rities haYe laboured to show that the Tekes (without discriminating between those of Akhal and Merv) were always regarded as subjects, vassals, or tribu taries of the Khan of Khiva, and that, in fact, they paid the Khan a tribute of one camel from each kala, or fort. It was alleged by the Journal de St. Peters- bourg, 28th February (11th March) 1876, that the Goklans of the Upper Gurgan and Attrek valleys, under Nur-Geldy Khan, were also feudatories or tributaries ot the Khan of Khiva. According to the articles in the Journal de St. Petersbourg, compiled from the reports, &amp;c., re^ ceived from Colonels Stebnitzke and Markozof in 1872, and from General Lomakin in 1875, the ar rangement entered into by the latter with the Tekes who were said to have represented their people at Krasnovodsk in the months of May and June 1874 was that, in lieu of this tribute in kind, the Tekes 6662 .

Following upon this General Lomakm. nevei- - marched his force m September 187o to La}at HadR wtence he sent Il-Geldy-Khan with ten other Aksakals on a mission to the Tekes, with an ultimatum to the effect that they should receive his presents, and submit to Russia, or prepare tor war/ They declined the presents, and accepted the Ct This circumstance, coupled with the annually re curring Russian reconn oissances from Krasnovodsk and Chikishlar, with the constant increase of the Russian forces in the trans-Caspian region mth General Ivanofs military expedition from th&lt; Ox s « to strike terror into the turbulent bands ot Teke.*, «« a nd other Turcomans,” and with the provocation unceasingly given to all the Turcomans alike by the Russian troops, through their systematic mode of compelling the tribes to supply them with camels, &amp;c., drove the Akhal Turcomans at last to turn to Persia for protection. Nur-Verdy, of Akhal, was accordingly empowered by the people to sup plicate the Shah to accept their allegiance, and m 1876 Kur-Yerdy succeeded in coming to terms with the Persian Government, an agreement being signed at Teheran, under which the Shah under took the protectorate of the Tekes, and appointed Kur-Verdy Chief of the Akhal Tek6s. This agree ment was rendered nugatory almost as soon as it was concluded, through an unwarrantable attack on the Akhal Turcomans by the Il-Khane or Governor of Bujnurd, with wdiom the Russian authorities had all along been in correspondence.

Hie liussian Government seem to have taken umbrage at these overtures, for immediately after wards it was reported that Generals Lomakin and Ivanof, meeting in the Kkanat of Khiva, and holding an interview with the Khan, who visited their camp on the 7th (19th) September 1876 near Kulma-Urgandj, discussed with the latter on the terms of his abdication in the face of his inability to curb the insubordinate spirit of the Turcomans within the confines of his own dominions, and to check the predatory habits of his feudatories of Akhal and Merv. General Ivanof entered into communication with the Tekes of Merv as well §-s with those of Akhal, inviting them to Itussian allegiance, and the Khan of Khiva was at the same time persuaded to write to them, saying that they were his subjects, and that he and the Itussian General would intercede for them with the Russian Government, so that they might be received with due favour. The reply of the Tekes to the Itussian General was that they were Persian subjects and in the Persian service. The Khan of Khiva followed up his address to the Tek^s by sending an officer (Musa-Mutevali) to act as Governor under him in the Akhal oasis. This produced dissensions among the people, who ranged themselves in opposite parties, and it would appear that the confusion into which they were thrown was in no small measure a fruit of Russian intrigue. It is alleged by Russian authorities that there was a strong Russian party in Akhal in 1875-76, headed by Nur-Verdy Khan, who, accord ing' to Captain Kuropatkin, pitted himself against the Khivan nominee. The Khivan nominee had been sent as Governor to Akhal by the Khan of Khiva, “ with the approval of the officer (Colonel “ Ivanof) commanding on the Oxus,” and yet, according to the same Russian authority, “ the “ Russian trans-Caspian authorities gave the pre- “ preference to Nur-Verdy, and Musa-Mutevali was “ obliged to return to Khiva. A large party of “ them (Akhalese) endeavoured to attach them- “ selves to Khiva, yet they failed in thisand even Nur-Verdy, unable to resist the majority of his fellow tribesmen, and alienated from the Russian interest, apparently by the double dealing Russian policy, was persuaded at last to join in a mission to Abul Ilassan Khan of Kuchan, which resulted in the payment of a certain sum of money* to the Tekes of Akhal by the Persian Government through the Governor of Kuchan for the maintenance of a Tur coman force of 1,400 men {farash and ketkhuds) “ to guard against depredations by turbulent people, “ and to prevent them from attacking Khorassan and “ Khiva, and from endangering the traffic on the “ Krasnovodsk road.” The Persian report of the agreement entered into between the Governor of Kuchan, and the Russian version of it, are here reproduced for the elucidation of the matter. iTranslation of a Document from Abul Hassan-Khan, son of Shoodja-ed-dowla, Governor of Kooclian, to Rukn-ud-dowla, Prince Governor of Khorassan. On the 27th of July 1876, 5th of Rejjib of the auspicious year of the Mause 1293, the whole of the Teke tribes of Atamish and Tokh- tamesh having submitted to Per sian allegiance, 5,000 of them came in a body from Kizil-P ahat to me at the fort of Peeroozah, Iving on the Zaaferan frontier. ^ I intimated the orders of Hie Persian Ministers to all of them, the whole of the 5,000 men, who had been deputed to act on the part of all, the Turcomans of Akhal having yielded their submission, appointed about a thousand of their Khans, Sirdars, leaders, and chief Elders to hold a special meeting with me, and arrange the necessary points of their allegiance to Persia. All of these having assembled in order to prove the sincerity of their submission and future alle giance, they, one and all, swore by the Koran, and they, in further support of their statements, also affixed their seals to the same Koran; the agreements which have been entered into with the several conditions thereof are herewith written for your Koyal ELighness’s information. They have solemnly bound them selves to obey and carry out each condition (as I now submit) as long as they live. Should even a kid’s tail be lost from Khelat up to Shahrood, they are not to behave as those scoundrels of Yemoots, who call themselves guards, yet one tribe professes allegiance, whilst the other one is rebellious. They (the Teke) are not such, they bind themselves that should, for in stance, one or two members of then tribes misbehave themselves by committing a robbery, or intend mischief, by the decree of the whole tribe his house will be burned down, he himself will be sent, under arrest, to your Royal Highness, or be beheaded, and his head sent, and whatever mav have Russian Version of the same from From Plowden’s Captain Kuropatkin’s Turco- ’ mania and the Turcomans. Miehell’s translation.) Abdul-Hassan-Khan, Governor of Kuchan, who was connected with the Akhal Tckes, and who had lived in exile among that people, tried, in view of their misadventures, to gain them over to Persia. At his in stance, Akhal-T6ke representatives came to Pauvriz, a Kurd fort, where they arrived at an understanding with Abdul-Hassan. They con sented to become subjects of Persia, on the condition that a certain large sum of money be paid to them for the maintenance of a guard of 1,500 men (farash, kctklwd, and watchmen). Having obtained the sanction of his Government to these terms, Abdul-Hassan proceeded with 40 of the representatives to Teheran. He was at first well re ceived, but soon after the Shah received a report from the Gover nor of Khorassan (the Shah-Zad6 Bukund-Davffi), to the effect that Abdul-Hassan was imposing on the Persian Government, that the Tekes had really no intention of becoming Persian subjects, that they were still making marauding incursions into Khorassan and plundering the Kurds, and that the Turcomans accompanying Abdul-Hassan were not representatives of their people, but common shepherds. In con sequence of this the 40 Tek6-Turco mans were despatched to Meshed for interrogation and trial, and only three of them escaped to tell the story of their unsuccessful mission. The failure of this scheme made the Turcomans turn again towards Russia. On the 9th of December 1876, some forty-five Teke Khans and Elders arrived at Krasnovodsk from the Akhal-Teke country with Mah- Mahommedof, one of General Lomakin’s messengers, and these declared that their late negotiations with Persia were entered into merely with a view to a recovery of their captive brethren in Persia. They gave assurances of their de votion to the White Tsar, invited U TlfOlO-riCI T'/'k PlWVII* 1 n T.Wbeen robbed will be made good. Should any one of their tribe do contrary to this, the whole of the chief men and Elders are to as semble and attack the said tribe, put the author of the mischief to death, and plunder his property, and that of his followers. It has been agreed that a place is to be erected for the hoisting of the Persian flag, which will form a residence for those Khans and Elders, as will be mentioned here after. This place will be built by the Persian Government, and named Nasseriah. The Persian flag-staff will be fixed on that building, and the Khans and elders with their horsemen will be stationed there. After the construction of the Nasseriah building and the hoist ing of the Persian standard, the whole of the Atamish Teke tribe, which are divided into the follow ing four tribes—the Atamish into Ak-Mesh and Ash-Ayak, and Taktamish with the Seech Maz and Taktamish Peg,—will each appoint a Khan, with 50 Elders, accompanied by 50 horsemen as their representatives. The Khan and Elders will be selected from the chief men of the tribe, and will reside at Nasseriah. Whatever orders may be issued by your Poyal Highness, they will carry out the same. These Elders and horsemen will be appointed agents of the whole of the Teke Turcomans. Whatever T6ke Turcoman may misbehave himself and act con trary to the conditions laid down, the 200 horsemen will, by the order of the Khans and Elders, put the offender to death and cut off his head. Whoever sets these con ditions at nought will be extermi nated. The whole of the Teke Turcomans have duly and solemnly appointed the above-mentioned Khans and Elders to be their re presentatives, and have bound them not to overlook or pardon any offence whatever, so that the arrangements which have been made may remain in force. These 200 Elders and 200 horse men who must come from Nas seriah, are coming from Ishk Abad and Kizil Rabat, which is 35 far- 6662 . j offered to supply them with hired farash, doubting the possibility of establishing order among them selves by any other means, seeing that the T6kes are a wild and wilful people. At the same time they consented to a Russian occu pation of some one point in their oasis, such as Kizyl-Arvat. These representatives, in addition to their verbal assurances, presented a letter to General Lomakin from the Akhal-Teke Khan, which fol lows in extenso :— “We have received your Excel lency’s letter, and were rejoiced to hear that you were in good health. “ You requested us by your letter to give you full and authentic in formation concerning recent events in Akhal-Teke, in consequence of which we acquaint you with the following,— “ The Akhal-Tdke consist of 32 tribes, all of which received a letter from Abdul-Hassan Khan, inviting them to send distinguished Elders to him, for the purpose of holding a conference. “ In answer to this invitation there assembled at Buzmein, from Kizyl-Arvat, Khudai-Verdy Khan: from Bami, Tura-Kongur; from Beurma, Oraz-Murad-Sardar (Tyk- ma-Sardar) ; from Archaman, Nur- Mohammed-Sardar; also all the Elders from the other Teke forts. After thisNur-Verdy Khan arrived at Gok Tepe, and at his request all the representatives proceeded to Pauvriz (a Kurd fort). Oraz- Mahmed Khan and Kurban-Murad- Iman forthwith began to persuade us to become Persian subjects, but, together with Nur-Verdy Khan, we positively refused to do so, saying that this could never be. Oil being asked our reason for this determination, we explained that if Khiva, which had existed inde pendently so many years, had been obliged in the end to fall into, the possession of the Ak-Padishah, the Akhal-Tckes, who had been 111 years in subjection to the Khans of Khiva, should likewise submit to the Ak-Padishah; that Akhal should be in the same hands that held Khiva. “ After this they began to per suade us to settle this affair, if only for the sake of our fellows whosakhs distant, and their horses and arms, &amp;c., belong to themselves. As they required an allowance, i arranged to pay four tomans a month to each of the two hundred horsemen, and seventeen krans and a half to each elder, and have accordingly paid their first month mvself at this rate. The pa} 0 the four Khans remains with the Persian Ministers, who can fix the salary of each individual in accor dance with his merits. An officer has been appointed for every filty horsemen, so that whenever they may be summoned, each officer will bring his fifty men with him. At present we are engaged m writing out the muster-roll ot the horsemen, together with the names of the Elders, and when completed I will forward the same to your Royal Highness. Whenever your Royal Highness may summon these 200 Teke horsemen to your presence, one hundred of them will remain at Akhal to prevent disorder and mis chief in that neighbourhood, and one hundred of them, with their . two officers, will appear before you to be reviewed. Their practice will be to come a hundred at a time before your Highness. They have engaged that, when ever the Persian Minister or your Royal Highness should require a body of horsemen over and above the present two hundred men, they will give us as much as one thousand men on condition that their pay fie fixed. These men are to be first class, and have good horses and arms. They will be included among the Khorasan horsemen. Should the Yemoot Turcomans of Asterabad rebel against the local Government of that place, and the Akhal Turcomans should be ordered to attack them, they have agreed to attack the Yemoots, to put down their mischief, and reduce them to full submission. The Russian commander at Shah- Kadam (Krasnovodsk) has sent letters and crosses of honour for the Chiefs and Khans of the Teke Turkomans. The Russian General at Khiva lias also addressed them., i 71 vitincr them to Russian allegi- were prisoners in Persia, and to this we consented. “ Nur-Verdy Khan, Nazrah-Kuli Khan, Oraz-Mahmed Khan, and I (Khan Mahmed - Atalyk) called upon Abdul - Hassan Khan in Pauvriz, having first agreed with Nur-Verdy Khan to demand of Abdul-Hassan Khan a sum of money 7 for the hire of 1,400 yhrew/t, ketkhud, and watchmen, making up our minds to return home if he would not comply. As soon as we came (entered Abdul-Hassan s house) Abdul-Hassan asked us what news we had brought, where upon we observed that as we had come to (from) Poke, the news must be his, not ours. Abdul- Hassan Khan told us that he had been to visit the Shah at Teheran, and that after talking on subjects connected -with the service the Shah had asked him who had formerly possessed Akhal, to which he had replied that Akhal had formerly 7 belonged to Khiva, which had been conquered by the Russians, and that it now belonged to no one, and desired to be annexed to Persia. The Shah ordered him to confer with the war minister (Sadr-Azam), who, after receiving Abdul-Hassan Khan’s explanations as to the pur port of his visit, by command of the Shah, invited the Russian Minister (Vizir Mukhtar) to his house, and repeated to the latter what Abdul-Hassan Khan had told him. The Russian Minister there upon stated that Akhal had been a dependency of Khiva, that Khiva was taken by the Ak-Padishah, and that therefore Akhal must belong to the power which governs Khiva, but that at the present time Akhal belonged neither to Khiva nor to Russia, and that whosoever should undertake to govern it would not be pleased with the task, because the people of Tekd are of a turbulent character, constantly engaged in robbery, so that it Avould be very difficult to establish order and tranquillity in their midst. The Sadr-Azam hereupon requested the Vizir-Mukhtar to let this matter rest until the autumn, pending which time some one might be sentance. The Khan of Khiva had also written to them that they formed part of the Khivan subjects, and therefore belonged to him, and ought to join him, and that he and the Russian General would inter cede for them with the Russian Government, so that they may be received with due favour. When I persuaded them, and promised that they would be treated with distinction and favour by the Per sian Government, and they gave their allegiance to Persia, they sent their reply to the Russian General and the Khan of Khiva, and distinctly wrote that they were Persian subjects and in the Persian service. It has been agreed that they are not to plunder the Russian caravans of Shah-Kadam (Krasnovodsk), and that they (the said caravans) are to travel in perfect safety. After the Tekes accepted the Persian rule and service, they re quested that the Persian Minister should make some arrangement by which the Russian Government might not interfere with them, and that they may be protected from that Government. I have assured them that, if they are sincere in their allegiance and service to Persia, they will be protected from the (Russian) Government. They have asked me to repre sent to the Persian Ministers and your Royal Highness that the Yemoot tribes of Khiva, who have now become Russian subjects, attack and plunder them, and that they have no choice but to re taliate. The Persian Government' must therefore be requested, in the first place, to make an arrange ment by which the Yemoots of Khiva should not plunder them, or else, if they plunder us, permis sion be given to us to retaliate. They request that trustworthy (Persian) officers may be appointed to reside at Deragez and Boojnoord, so that the Governors of these parts may not accuse them of ill- doing and making raids, and that their caravans may travel about freely. Por instance, after they submitted to Persian rule and accepted service, they asked me to cerning the Tdke country; and so the matter dropped. “ Having finished his story, Andul-Hassan turned to us and said, ‘ I have invited you to come ‘ here for the purpose of persuading ‘ you to send your Jcetkhuds to the ‘ Shah to conclude a peace, whereby ‘ you should agree not to injure £ Khorassan, and in return receive ‘ back all prisoners, for which pur- £ pose I went to Teheran, and shall { now go again, and request you to £ send 40 ketkhuds along with me/ To this Mahmed - Atalyk Khan replied that Akhal-Teke had been conquered by a Khan of Khiva 111 years ago. Where were you (Persians) at the time ? The Kurds and you also existed at that time. Why does not Akhal appertain to you to the present time ? Akhal Teke belongs now to the Ak- Padishah, and we cannot admit the thought that the Russians are weaker than Uzbegs, and capable of surrendering Akhal to others. Abdul-Hassan said that he had had nothing to do at that time with the Khajars, but that now, as a faithful subject of the Shah, he had received his commands to take pos session of his country. We re torted, ‘ We are faithful subjects * of the Ak-Padishah, and Tekd ‘ belongs to him, so that without 4 his will we can do nothing.' After this Abdul-Hassan said that the Shah would ask the Ak-Padishah to cede Akhal-Tekd to him, and if this could not be done he would waive his claim to Akhal. “AbduhHassan next began to persuade us to send 40 ketkhuds with him to the Shah in order to arrange terms of peace and to ob tain the surrender of Turcoman prisoners, on the condition that we should not molest Khorassan any more. Nur-Verdy Khan remarked that we could not, unconditionally, check the people in their maraud ing practices, but that we would consent to do so on receipt of pay for 1,400 men, i.e., 200 ketkhuds % 200 far ash, and 1,000 watchmen. Thereupon Abdul-Hassan Khan fixed the following monthly rates of pay:—20 krans for each keU khud, and 40 krans for each far ash ;allow their caravans to proceed wherever they liked. Several members of their caravans went to Boojnoord, and Yad Mahomed Khan, the Elkhanee of Boojnoord, seized them, and took all their horses and arms. An arrange ment must be made so as to encourage them, and make them observe their arrangements. It has been arranged that they are to send 20 horsemen as Gholams, to be always in atten dance upon your Boyal Highness, and receive their pay from the Persian Government. Whenever your Boyal Highness thinks proper to relieve them on fur lough, 20 others will come in their place, so that 20 of their horse men may be in constant attendance upon your Boyal Highness as Gholams. The lands which lie between Koochan, Shadloo, Boojnoord, and the Teke country, and extend from the frontier of Boojnoord to the eastern frontier of Deragez, have for a number of years re mained unsown, and neither side have cultivated them. The Tekd Turcomans now request that as much as the Zaaferanloo tribe, the Shadloos, and the people of Heragez can cultivate should be allotted to them, and the remainder given to the Turcomans for their cultivation and pasture lands, and they will give one tenth of the produce of their harvest to the Persian Government. Eor the present, I have given no answer on this subject, awaiting your de cision on the matter. Apparently such a step would not be without advantages, if the said lands be granted to them by degrees, five families and ten families at a time, and will come and settle there, and begin cul tivating the fields, and an inter course will spring up between them and the people of this side. In time they will become familiar; and our people will derive the benefit thereof. They will also give a tenth of the produce of the lands granted to them, and little by little they will be made to pay heavy taxes and I'evenue. but the pay of the 1,000 watchmen he said he could not fix until he had had an interview with the Shah, adding that he would at once dis burse the money for 400 men, and requesting us to employ, while he was at Teheran, 1,000 men to guard against depredations by turbulent people, and to prevent them from attacking Khorassan and Khiva, and from endangering the traffic on the Krasnovodsk road. Nur- Yerdy Khan hereupon observed that if the monthly payment were made with regularity, ail this should be done, but that otherwise he could not guarantee security (against the Turcomans), and would not hold himself responsible. “ After this all who had as sembled at the conference dispersed to their several aiils, having ap pointed 40 ketkhuds to accompany Abdul-Hassan Khan to Teheran. “ Eater on, four men with Oman Geldy brought 5,000 krans, of which 1,500 were paid to the farash of the tribe of Sigmash ; 1,500 to the fai'ish of Yakshi-Tash- Ayak, 1,000 to the farash of the Vakil (Nur-Verdy Khan’s) tribe, and 1,000 to the farash of the Bek tribe (Hraz-Mohmed Khan’s). Eor the ketkhuds and other farash, Abdul-Hassan Khan promised to send money from Kuchan. AVe did not receive any more of the promised money besides the krans, which were duly distributed, there fore the plan agreed upon was not carried out, and since then we have been plundering the Persians as usual, and they have been plunder ing us.” “We report accurately to your Excellency as above, and if any one sends you another communica tion disagreeing with ours, we beg you not to put any faith in it. “ We agreed to the proposition made by Abdul-Hassan only be cause our people are in captivity in Persia, whom we wish to recover. In reality we and our land are yours. We belong to and serve the Khan of Khiva, which is tan tamount to serving you, since the Khan of Khiva cannot manage his own affairs, let alone us. We Tur comans are simple people, and shall obey your commander. EurtherIn short, the result will be that of their own free will and choice great numbers of their families will very shortly enter our territory and establish themselves there. Respecting the taxes on families and revenues, as it is the outset of the undertaking, and a number of their Chiefs and Elders were setting out to wait upon your Royal High ness, I have made no allusion to that subject, and have not dis cussed the point until they have waited upon your Royal Highness, and are assured of your favour and kindness. arrangements will depend front you.” ^ You wrote that the captives taken at Kara-Bugaz, and the pro perty seized there, should be de livered up. In answer to this demand, we inform you that three of the captives escaped to their country, and that three others have been sent to their homes by Ata- xSazar Bek, who was instructed to despatch them.” The Turcomans of Karee-Kala also came in a body to me, and have joined in the above engage ments made by the Adchal Turco mans. They took a solemn oath, and have agreed to pay a tax of one toman per annum for each family. According to the number of their families they will pay a toman per annum. An Elder also came from the Nakher tribe of Turcomans, and engaged to join the other Turco mans in the agreements they have entered upon. * This is more than doubtful. The state ment has been repeatedly made by Russian writers, but I cannot find any direct evidence in Russian publications of the participation of a Teke contingent either in the feeble re sistance made to the Russians by the Uzbegs on the Oxus at Shurakhan or in the affair with the Yomuds at Ilyali. Major Napier has it that the gunner Kidayef was captured on the Oxus by a Teke party of marauders, but it is elsewhere shown on Russian autho rity that Kidayef was seized by a party of Yomuds. t Plowden’s Precis, p. 42, 1875-77. _ or tne Moscou wrote at the time, “It must be remem- bered that the Akhal T6kd Turcomans who have become Persian subjects through outside influ- ence lought against our detachments at Khiva ^ « an &lt;Ji that °ur account with them is not yet &lt;c se ! : , t ; e ^ 1 .

Even after this the Tekd Elders presented them selves to the General,f protesting their friendly disposition towards Russia, and offering to supply the General’s camp with barley and other neces saries. Being short of supplies, General Lomakin made a hurried retreat, but the T6kes did not molest or pursue him. Eollowing the example of the Tekds of Akhal, those of Merv, having failed in their previous over tures, in the year 1873 and again in 1876, to the Amir of Cabul, likewise sent a deputation, in January 1877, to Persia, offering allegiance to the Shah and soliciting Persian protection. The Merv Turcomans would have preferred going over to Afghanistan instead of to Persia, and would probablv have again solicited the Amir but for the removal from Herat and imprisonment of Yakub Khan, who, they said, knew how to manage the Turcomans. In the Amir, Shere Ali, they had not the same confidence, and the Merv deputies to Teheran (October 1877)J acknowledged that, in the event of a failure of their negotiations with Persia, they would have no alternative but to submit to Russia, by whom they expected soon to be hard pressed. The Persian Government, however, concluded an agreement with the people of Merv, and^ conferred upon them, in December 1877, a firman in general terms,§ setting forth that “ the T6ke Turcomans *&lt; of Merv have always been and now are subjects ' of Persia; that all disloyal acts committed by “ them in past years are forgiven ; and that, in con “ sideration of their now engaging to act as obedient “ and faithful subjects, they will receive the royal *« protection and favour.” ^ ? The terms of agreement between the fehah s Government and the T6kes of Merv were as follows:— 1. The Merv Turcomans declare their allegiance to Persia. 2. They engage that raids by them on Persian territory shall entirely cease. 3. The Persian flag shall be hoisted at Merv. 4. A Persian agent shall reside at Merv, on the part of the Shah. 5. One hundred hostages (men of position from the four divisions of the tribe) shall reside at Meshed, but without their families. 6. A body of 1,000 horsemen shall be sent to Meshed (about 250 from each division of the tribe) to be employed in the service of the Persian Government. These horsemen are to provide their own horses and arms, and to be under the command of their own chiefs, but they are to be paid by the Persian Government, and they may be employed in any part of Persia where their services are required.

M. de Giers to Mr. Wyndham, 25th May 1881. The Shah’s Government agreed,— 1. To recognize the Merv Turcomans as Persian subjects, and accorded them protection and favourable treatment. 2. To defray the expenses of the hostages sent to Meshed, which may be estimated at about 6,000 tomans a year. 3. To pay the horsemen furnished by the Turco mans for service in Persia at the same rate as that allowed by the Government to the Khorassan Irregular Horse, which will amount to over 30,000 tomans annually. 4. To permit 1,000 families of Merv Teke Turco mans to occupy Old Sarakhs and the lands adjacent on the Tejend. In the meantime, Kaushid Khan, the elected chief of the Teke Turcomans of Merv, had died, and was succeeded by his son Baba Khan. All the attempts made by the Tekes of Akhal to conciliate the Russians and to arrest the hostile advances of the latter having failed, all but those in the pay of the Russian Government, now deter mined to offer vigorous resistance, and in 1878, even Nur-Verdy Khan was found at the head of organized bands operating in 1877 and 1878 against the Russian invading forces at Kizil-Arvat. With the Tekes of Akhal, as with those of Merv, there were no further attempts at negotiation made by the Russian authorities, as there was no further necessity for them, and the Russian Government having at first, from 1869 to 1873, bracketed the Turcoman question with that of Khiva, now pur sued the former on independent political grounds. The overthrow of the Tekes of Akhal at Geok Tepe and the incorporation with Russia of the Akhal oasis under Imperial Ukaz of 12th (24th) May 1881, closes this eventful period, and in justice to the Turcomans, whose character was so blackened by Russia up to their final subjugation in 1881, the following opinion of them has at last been expressed by the Russian Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs :— “ They are not only good warriors, but a people on whose word reliance can be placed. ,,Henvey’s Precis, 1872-75, p. 20.

Shore-Ali-Khan, the late Amir of Afghanistan, entertained a great anxiety on account of the Russian advances from the Caspian, and inde pendent of the language used by him at a Durbar at Cabul, the Cabul Envoy informed the Viceroy, on the 12th July 1873, that “the rapid advances “ made by the Russians in Central Asia has “ aroused the gravest apprehensions in the minds “ of the people of Afghanistan,” the Amir saying, that “ whatever specific assurances the Russians “ might give, and however often these might be “ repeated, the people of Afghanistan could place “ no confidence in them, and would never rest “ satisfied unless they were assured of the aid of “ the British Government.” What the late Amir said at the Durbar, as re ported to the India and Home Governments, was as follows:— “ God alone knows what will happen if, refusing to accept Russian nationality, the Turcomans sought refuge from the Russians in Badgheez in Herat and were pursued by the Russians. In such a case the Russians would from time to time call upon the Afghan Government either to prevent the Turcomans from aggression, or to permit the Russins to punish those hostile tribes. In this manner the Russians would make communications for exercising some influence in my country.”* In answer to the question put by the Envoy of the Amir of Cabul to the Viceroy of India on the 30th July 1873, as to the reply which the Amir should give to the Turcomans who had offered allegiance to Afghanistan and had preferred a re quest for advice as to the attitude they should assume to the Russians who had demanded a passage for their troops through the Turcoman territory, His Excellency counselled the Amir “ to “ abstain from interference in the affairs of the “ Turcomans beyond his frontier, and to disclaim “ the allegiance which had been proffered to him “ by them. The Russians,” it w r as added, “ had a “ just and legitimate quarrel with the Khan of “ Khiva, to punish whom their troops were then “ marching through the Tekd country.” If the Amir thought it necessary to give the Tekes advice, it should be to the effect that they should allow an unmolested passage to the Russians, and in no way whatever interfere with their operations. * The very same opinion was expressed in the note addressed to me by Sirdar Iskander Khan Barukzei when he was in London, which was inserted in my Memorandum on Merv in 1875. 6662 . N]}&gt; nil i Ijl It does not appear on what grounds the Govern ment of India identified the operations against the T6k£s of Akhal with the military measures against Khiva. It was doubtless with a view to an expedition to Khiva in the first instance that the occupation of Krasnovodsk was effected in the year 1869, but the Russians had invaded Akhal regularly once a year from that time, hour years before the proclamation of their “ legitimate grievance and of a war against Khiva, they had several times pushed back the Tekds as far as Beurma. Our knowledge of the geography of that part of Central Asia was, indeed, not perfect in 1873, yet such as it was, it cannot be said that there was less reasonable ground for assuming at that time that the road to Khiva led through the country of the Tdke Turcomans than that it led to the rounding off of the Russian frontier through Merv, Maimena and Andkhui to Tashkend. Look ing back at this time, we find that the Russian operations against the Tekes have formed a question quite independent of the question of the “ legitimate quarrel ” with Khiva, and we cannot now but draw the conclusion that the whole series of Russian commanding officers in the trans-Caspian region since the year 1869 were on their part sufficiently well acquainted with the physical and political geography of Turcomania from the Caspian to Merv, and that they well knew that a passage of their troops through Akhal was not calculated to bring them in the end to Khiva. Even in the early part of 1873, there was abundant proof of the fact that the Russian Government itself regarded the operations against Khiva and those against the Tekes as separate and distinct questions, and it is difficult to conceive why we should have connected them. Naturally alarmed, as much by the view taken by the British Government of the line of march of the Russian troops operating in the trans-Caspian region, as by the clamorous applications of the Turcomans for counsel and aid, the Amir again, in July 1873, applied for a definite answer to his question as to how far he could rely on our help if invaded. It was evident that he was favouring the design of harbouring the Turcomans when the latter should be driven out of their country, with a view to distributing the tribes throughout his own pro vinces, and of so strengthening and consolidating his power. He was, however, assured that Her Majesty’s Government did not share his apprehensions. Nor did there seem to be any occasion to share those apprehensions if any reliance was to be placed on the assurance given by Prince Gorchakoff, through Lord Augustus Loft us, to the effect that the Russian Government “ had no intention of undertaking an expedition against the Turco- “ mans,” and, accordingly, after Lord A.

Plowden’s Afghan Precis, 1872—1879, p. 150. had^ represented to the Russian Government the anxiety felt by the Amir on the score of the Russian operations against the Turcomans, which were calculated to produce complications with the Amir of Afghanistan, our Government, at the invitation of the Russian Chancellor, advised the Amir to render impossible the eventuality which he (the Amir) foresaw, by “ giving the Turcomans to “ understand plainly beforehand that, if they “ challenge measures of severity by acts of plunder “ against us (the Russians), they must not reckon “ on any aid or shelter from hinl. ,, The British Government had on a former occasion been made use of by the Imperial Chancellor as a means of communication with a Central *Asian potentate (the Amir of Kashgar), whom the Government of India was invited to assure, on Prince Gorchakoff s authority, that Russia had na hostile intentions towards him. But the worth of this assurance was perfectly measurable by the allegation that “ it rested entirely “ with them (the Turcomans) to live on a good “ understanding with us (Russians), and even to “ derive advantage from our proximity ” .... and by the further passage that “ if these trouble- “ some tribes betook themselves to acts of aggression &lt;f and brigandage against us, w r e should be forced “ to chastise them.” This same reservation has been made by the Russian Government in every instance since the circular despatch of Prince Gorchakoff of the 21st November (3rd December) 1864. The proceedings of General Lomakin among the Turcomans of the Gurgan, his violation of Persian territory (crossing the Gurgan to Kurreem Kala), and the action taken by him in regard to the Tek6s of Akhal, coupled with the Russian relations with those of Merv in 1874, aroused the apprehensions of the Persian Government, while they still con tinued to cause anxiety to the Amir of Afghan istan. Moved by the Russian encroachments in the Turcoman country, the India Government observed that the Russian proceedings could “not fail to “ excite uneasiness and alarm ” both “ in the minds “ of our Persian ” as w~ell as our “Afghan allies,’* and that “they demand the serious attention of “ Her Majesty’s Government.” “Having with anxious attention followed the “ progress of events in Central Asia and on the “ frontier of Persia and Afghanistan,” and “ seeing “ that they were sufficiently grave to inspire “ solicitude, and to suggest the necessity of timely “ precaution,” the Marquis of Salisbury, opening with a reference to the “ scantiness of the infor- “ mation supplied by the Indian Government, and expressing the opinion that “ more exact and con- “ stant information is necessary to the conduct of “ a circumspect policy at the present juncture,” instructed the Government of India to procure the assent of the Amir of Afghanistan (an assent which62 in 1869 and in 1873 the Amir had not been un willing to give), to the establishment of a British agency at Herat. In reply to this the Viceroy, stating the reasons for his objection to procuring the assent of the Amir of Cabul to the establishment of agencies at Herat or at Candahar, observed as follows :— “ Much discussion has recently taken place as to the effect that would be produced by a Russian advance on Merv. We have before stated to Her Majesty’s Government our apprehensions that the assumption by Russia of authority over the whole Turcoman country would create alarm in Afghan istan, and we think it desirable to express our opinion of the course which should be adopted if it should take place. It would then become necessary to give additional and more specific assurances to the ruler of Afghanistan that we are prepared to assist him to defend Afghanistan against attack from without. It would then be desirable to enter into a treaty engagement with him; and the esta blishment of a British Resident at Herat would be the natural consequence of such an engagement, and of the nearer approach of the Russian frontier.” Further,— “ We think that these would be the measures best calculated to avert any dangers that may ensue from a Russian advance to Merv, and that they should be adopted when the necessity for them arises. The observations addressed on this subject by the Earl of Derby to Count Schouvaloff appear to us to indicate the policy which should be pursued by the Government of India, and we have before stated our opinion that the more clearly Russia is given to understand the position which we have assumed townrds Afghanistan, the greater will be the probability of the maintenance of peace. To anticipate the Russian occupation of Merv by any active measures or specific treaty engagement would, in our opinion, be more likely to prejudice than to advance the interests of Her Majesty s Indian Empire.” Government of India to Secretary of State, No. 19, 7th June 1875. In the year 1876 the late Amir entertained the idea of negotiating the “ removal of the Turcoman &lt;f tribes from Akhal and Merv to Afghanistan, and « their distribution throughout the different pro- “ yinces of his kingdom, whereby,” he considered, “ the Turcomans would become adherents of Af- “ ghanistan, and be useful in promoting the strength “ of the Afghan kingdom.” The Chiefs of Herat had reported that the Tur comans of Akhal and Merv had again turned towards Afghanistan for counsel and aid in view of the Russian advances. India, No. 38. Government of India to Secretary of State, 11th September 1876.At this time, however, the Amir contemplated the arrangement without reference to the British Government.* * India, No. 38, Government of India to Secretary of State, 11th September 1876 :— Extract from Cabul Diary from 21st to 24th July 1876, inclusive^ “ The Mustaufi and the Herat Chiefs represented to the Amir that in the Turcoman territory there are two noted Chiefs, Khur- shid Khan of Merve-i-Shahjehan and Nur Wirdi Khan of Akhal; that Nur Wirdi Khan has one house (meaning family) in Akhal and one in Merv, with a view to maintaining more influence amongst his people, and that he lately wrote to Khurshid Khan as follows:—‘ It is reported that the Russians intend to attack us ‘ next winter. We will therefore collect first in Akhal and send ‘ our families and children to you in Merv. Should we be un- ‘ successful in opposing the Russians in Akhal, we will go to * Merv, and, in the event of the Russians forcing us to quit the * fort of Merv, we will kill our families and children with our * swords, leave the fort, and continue to oppose the Russians ‘ vigorously so long as we live.’ ” Extract from Cabul Diary from 25th to 27th July 1876, inclusive. 44 On the authority of a letter received from the Deputy Go vernor of Herat, Mirakhor Ahmed Khan, the Mustaufi reported to the Amir that the Turkmans had abandoned the sale of their horses for some time past, with a view to keep themselves in readiness to oppose (the Russians), but that now the brother of Khurshid Khan, Chief of Merv, has arrived at Herat ostensibly with 70 horses for sale, but really with a letter from some Turk man Elders expressing themselves allies of the Amir. His Highness ordered the Mustaufi to write to the Mirakhor on his own part, to show' suitable honour to the brother of Khurshid Khan, to purchase some horses of superior breed from him, to submit the letter to Cabul, and after granting him a suitable khillat and making verbal assurances, send him back to Turkman territory, telling him that a reply to the letter would be sent to him. to Merv as soon as it is received from Cabul.” Extract from Cabul Diary from 8th to 10th August 1876, inclusive. 4 “ The Amir observes on several occasions, privately, as fol lows :— “ ‘ Since the Russians have taken possession of Kharizm, I have been under the impression that they (the Russians) would some time make an attack on Akhal, Merv Shahjehan, and other Turco man territories, and that, owing to their misconduct, the Turcomans will hardly be able to take refuge in any State other than (Afghan istan), and will undoubtedly take up their residence in Badgis (a dependency of Herat), a large plain abounding in water and pasturage for cattle, &amp;c., and at considerable distance from Balkh and Herat. Also that, through fear lest the said Turcomans should commit raids within Russian dominions, the Russians would ask Afghanistan either to guarantee the good behaviour of the Turcomans, or allow them (the Russians) to punish the latter so suitably as to prevent future outrages by them. J'rom what I hear of the state of affairs in Turcoman territory, I mink that my above-mentioned prevision would prove correct shortly— probably this very year. I now feel great anxiety day and night lest, in the event of the Russians overcoming the Turcomans and the latter taking refuge in Badgis, and the Russians troubling Afghanistan to become security for the good behaviour of the Turcomans towards them, Afghanistan may hardly be able to become security for such a multitude, owing to their inveterate bad habits. Under these circumstances, it is desirable that, having regard to the frontier of other States the Afghan Government should in a diplomatic manner distribute the Turcomans in suitable groups of families to-differeut provinces throughout Afghanistan, and assign allowances (lit., fees) to them, and after enlisting their elders or representatives with some followers in Government 6662. O■employ on suitable salaries, keep them (elders, Ac.) at CabuL &lt;?o thift the whole of the Turcoman tribe may become adherents of Afghanistan and as they are mnch noted as irregular sowars the°v may some time or other be useful in promoting the stiength of the Afghan Government. On the occasion (of the disaster) which ha? shortly to befall the Turcomans on the part of the Russians it is most incumbent and necessary on the Go\einmc of Afghanistan to carry out the above contemplated measures. Should the present income of Afghanistan be found insufficient to meet the^expenses to be incurred on account of tne Turcomans, it is the duty of the Goverument to avoid other useless expenses and of necessity oblige this valuable tribe (with kindness,. « His Highness occasionally makes such observations to the Herat Chiefs who have come with the Mustaufi as to assure them Sat the Government is inclined to provide for their adherents, the Turcoman tribe, and to persuade them to inform the Turcomans on tkeir own part of the intentions of the Government towards them.” Telegram, No. 203]P., dated 5th September 1876, from Viceroy, 6 Simla, to Secretary of State, London. Cabul Diary of 8th August reports Amir’s apprehensions that Russia will shortly attack Turcomans of Akhal and Merv, and that Turcomans will retire to Badgis. Afghanistan will then be held responsible for them, and complications will arise.

Henvey’s Precis, 1872—75, pp. 92 and 93. j-n the year 1834, the British and Russian Governments came to a common understanding respecting the independence and integritv of the dominions of the Shah of Persia, which, in the year 1838, Count Nesselrode referred to as “ still sub- “ sisting in full force.” Central Asia, to 174. No. 1 (1878), pp. 170, 172 Ibid, p. 176. In the year 1865, after a great deal of evasion on the part of the Russian Chancellor, Sir Andrew Buchanan succeeded in extracting from Prince Gortchakotf a confidential assurance (given through the Russian Ambassador in London) “ of the firm f&lt; intention of the Emperor to respect the integrity u of Persia.” Sir E. Hertslet’s Foreign Office Memo randum ; February, 1873. In the meanwhile the Shah had on numerous occasions expressed his anxiety on the score of the integrity of his dominions in view of the steady progress of the Russian encroachments and pro ceedings on the South littoral of the Caspian. Thus, to begin with the period of the Russian occupation of Ashurada, remonstrances were ad- diessed by the Persian Government to the Russian Ambassador at Teheran, which were treated so lightly by Count Medem that, in the year 1846, the Shah was obliged to ask Colonel Sheil “ if the “ British Government would give him any assist- “ ance at St. Petersburg to enable him to effect the ' removal of the Russians from the island ?” Mr. Thomson did in 1853 “point out in the strongest terms to the Persian Government the “ consequences which would ensue from allowing Russia to ^ get a footing on the mainland near Asterabad (Gez), and he was instructed to urge the Persian Government to put Astrabad and other Persian forts on the Caspian in a state of defence, but “ by advice of the British Government “ the Sadr Azem, proposed that no steps should be “ taken provided Ashurada was immediately eva cuated. The Russian Chargd d’Affaires admitted that “ Ashurada was undoubtedly a portion of “ Persian territory,” but he said that it w;s im possible for Russia to evacuate that island; and calling upon the Shah to annul the orders which had been issued for the defence of the coast, the works were not proceeded with. a he Persian Government on all occasions evinced a disposition to resist Russian encroachments, showing a disquietude at the Russian proceedings on the coast and among the Turcoman subjects of the Shah. Thus, besides the appointment of an European officer to put the coast defences in a stateof efficient repair, garrisons were placed at Gez and elsewhere to check the Turcomans when it was found that the Russians were establishing a force in Astrabad Bay, under the pretext of a friendly solicitude for the security of the Persian borders. Later in the year 1865, the Persian troops destroyed the “ fortifications near Asterabad, which were “ supposed to have been erected at the instigation “ of Russia.” In the year 1869 the Persian Government re monstrated against the Russian occupation of Krasnovodsk, but it appears from all official docu ments that while British influence prevailed to a certain degree with the IVlinisters of the Shah, the Shah himself was prevailed upon by the Prussian representatives to waive his objections to the various Russian proceedings, and to acknowledge them when they were faits accomplis. By this means all the attempts made by the Persian Government to secure its frontiers were frustrated. This is illustrated by the following extract from Sir E. Hertslet’s “ Memorandum on Russian En- « croachments ”:— “ In June 1866, it was announced that a secret understanding existed between Persia and^ Russia, by which the Russian Government promised the Shah that, if he would desist from intriguing against the Russians and keep perfectly tranquil, . . . Russia would do her utmost to enable the Shah to obtain possession of Herat.” After vain remonstrances by the Persian Ministers against the establishment of a Russian naval station at Ashurada, the Shah was led to compromise him self in the matter, giving, as it were, his sanction to the measure by accepting an imitation to go on board one of the vessels of the Russian flotilla in Astrabad Bay. While the Persian Minister protested against the lodgment effected by the Russians on the East Coast of the Caspian at Krasnovodsk, the Shah was persuaded by M. Beger, the Russian Minister at Teheran, to issue a firman to the Governor of Astrabad, saying that “ the Russians intended “ having a post at Kizyl-Soo for their commerce “ with Turkestan, and that such a step would in no “ way injuriously affect Persia, its subjects and “ tribes,” and at the same time, His Highness received the following note which constituted the secret agreement between him and the Russian Government in respect to the frontier between Persia and Russia:— “ His Majesty the Sbah having, on the 12th instant (4th December 1869), requested the under signed, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Pleni potentiary of His Majesty the Emperor, to explain for what object the fort at Kyzil-Soo (Krasnovodsk) was being constructed, and having also required an assurance that the Russian authorities would in no way interfere in the affairs of the Yemoot Turko mans, and of those living on the Attrek and57 ■ Goorgaun rivers; also that no fort or stronghold should hereafter be built at the embouchures of the Attrek and Goorgaun rivers ; and likewise that they should not interfere in any way with the pos sessions of Persia, but that the Persian Government should continue to maintain the authority they have hitherto held in respect to these tribes and their territories. In accordance with the wish expressed by His Majesty the Shah, the undersigned lost no time in referring, by telegraph, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of His Majesty the Emperor, and he has now the pleasure to bring to the knowledge of the Ministers of His Majesty the Shah the reply which he has just received, to the effect that the Government of His Majesty the Emperor re cognizes the authority and sovereignty of Persia up to the banks of the Attrek River; that they have no intention to construct any fort. “ (Signed) M. Beger.” Henvey’s Precis, 1872—75, p. 68. Parliamentary Papers, Central Asia, No. 2 1873), p. 25. Ibid, p. 20. Plowden’s Precis, 1875—77, p. 28, and Sir E. Hertslet’s Foreign Office Memo randum, 1877. This was the result of the proposal made to M. Beger by the Persian Minister (Mirza Said Khan) that he “ should engage formally on the part &lt;f of his Government that the Russians would not “ occupy any territory to the South of Kizyl-Soo “ (Krasnovodsk), and that he should also come to “ a distinct understanding with the Shah’s Ministers “ as to what was to be recognized as the Persian “ boundary line along the frontiers of the Turcoman “ country.” Describing at great length the manner in which the above points had been discussed in detail between himself and the Russian Minister, Mirza- Said Khan observed to Mr. Thompson in Novem ber 1869 that, “ if Her Majesty’s Government were “ now induced to exert their influence to restrain “ Russia on this side, the Shah and his Ministers “ conceived that the danger with which the frontier “ was threatened would be averted.” It was the Persian Minister who added the clause to the effect that the Russians were not to cross the Attrek, and this was as much as he could do, notwithstanding the strong arguments used by the Persian Governor of Astrabad in con demnation of any countenancing of the Russian encroachments. It was notified from Teheran to the Governor of Astrabad that “ the Russians “ are not to cross the Attrek, which is six fur- “ sakhs distant from the Gurgan river at Ak- &lt;f Kaleh ; they are at liberty to build whatever “ they like on the other side of the Attrek, but not “ anything on the Persian side.” In the year 1872 M. Stremoukhof, in a con versation with Her Majesty’s Ambassador, denied the existence of any agreement with Persia in 1869 over the Attrek frontier, while, later (March 1875), the Russian Minister at Teheran, answer ing a letter addressed to him by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which the latter maintained the unchallengeable claim of Persia 6662 . pto the allegiance of certain Turcoman tribes, and questioned the validity of the arrangement ot 1869, strenuously insisted on the clearness and sufficiency of that agreement. The articles in the Morning Post and in the Daily News of January 1873, in which it was stated, on the one hand, that Persia had ceded to Russia the valley of the Attrek, and on the other, that she had surrendered a portion of Khorassan, gave the Shah’s Poreign Minister and his Minister in London an excuse to deny the existence of a treaty under which any 1 ersian territory had been ceded to Russia. It is to he gathered from the whole of the Persian correspondence that the Persian Ministers were strongly opposed to all the Russian proceedings on the East coast of the Caspian, and this may serve to explain the unwillingness of the Sadr-Azem to confess to any knowledge of the negotiations con ducted in secret by the Shah with M. Beger. The Sadr-Azem went so far as to contradict the fact that “ the Shah did send an officer of his Court, ct w ho read to the Russian Minister an autograph « memorandum, but did not give a copy of it, ex it pressing His Majesty’s satisfaction with the “ declaration” above given. # . The construction which the Persian Minister placed upon that declaration was, however, narrower than was implied by the “damaging admission made by them” (the Persian Government) cc m it reserving to the Russians a liberty to build whatever they liked on the other side of the Attrek. The Persian Government “ explained to it ]yx. Beger that the declaration respecting the &lt;« Attrek had no reference to the territory in the « interior towards Khorassan, hut regarded only &lt;« the territory adjoining the province of Astrabad, it that is, from the Caspian coast at the mouth &lt;« 0 f the Attrek along the banks of the river “ for about 30 miles to where the Gurgan district i« onds but M. Beger avoided a discussion of the ^TbisHne of frontier having been recently defined by the Persian and Russian Governments, there is no call for any explanation of the misapprehensions which existed on the point. And no case of violation of Persian rights can properly be made out of the occupation of Chikishlar in the face of the nermission distinctly given to the Russians by the Shah’s firman to build “ whatever they like on the «* other side of the Attrek.” The only reprehensible circumstance m con nection with this matter was the categorical denial given in February 1872 by M. Stremoukhof to Sir A. Buchanan that there was any other fort on the line of the Caspian to the Persian frontier but those of Alexandrofsk and Krasnovod$k. (Vide Part I., “ Russian Acts and Aims,” p. Jfe.) Mr. Grant Duff did indeed observe in the House of Commons on the 22nd April 1873 that Chikishlar Henvey’s Pr6cis, 1872—75, p. 70. Sir E.

What was strange in respect to Chikishlar was* the (Russian official) denial that a fort had been built there. Prince Gorchakoff, however, declared to Sir Andrew Buchanan that the Shah of Persia had never any “better claim to the country of the “ Turcomans than the King of Italy U the throne “ of Jerusalem, upon which the Persian Govern- “ ment, anxious to preserve its suzerain rights over “ the Turcoman country between the Attrek and “ the Gurgan, asked the Russian Government for ** assurances, which were readily given, that Russia “ did not intend to build fortresses or establish “ themselves on the Attrek.” While the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs was exchanging notes with the Russian Minister at Teheran, and the Persian Minister at St. Peters burg was remonstrating to Prince Gorchakoff, on the subject of the Russian violation of the Attrek frontier, in the spring of 1873, the Persian Minister in London was representing to Earl Granville that “ the Persian Government were becoming uneasy,” . . . and inquiring “ whether the time had not “ come for recognizing the integrity of Persia.” The Persian Government was seriously agitated by the proceedings of the Russians, and efforts were made in all directions to enlist the interest of the British Government. The first attempt to sound the British Government on the question was made by Malcolm Khan, who mooted it to the British Ambassador at Vienna in February 1873. On the 26th February, Mr. Thomson wrote from Teheran that the Persian Government had received a telegram from London to the effect that in the correspondence which had recently taken place between the British and Russian Governments respecting Central Asia, Russia had declared that she recognized the integrity of Persia. Until the year 1873, the Government of the Shah were not aware of the fact of the existence of the understanding of 1834, and of the renewal of that agreement in the year 1865. The Sadr-Azem inquired whether Mr. Thomson had received any intelligence to that effect. “ He observed that the Shah and his Ministers would feel grateful to Her Majesty’s Government if they had succeeded in obtaining an assurance of this nature from the Russian Government, It required very little reflection, he said, to enable any Persian to understand that Russia was the natural enemy of Persia, and that England on the contrary, in her own interests, must desire tomaintain the independence of this country. He considered that the only chance of safety for Persia was for her to ally herself with England, and seek the friendship and support of Her Majesty’s Go vernment. The policy, therefore, which he had adopted when he came into office, and which he was now earnestly endeavouring to carry out, was in a few words this, to ‘ menager la Russie, and secure the confidence and good will of England. His views and opinions on this subject had been duly explained to the Shah, who approved of them, and although the British Government, he knew, had been brought to regard Persia with distrust, owing to a different policy having been pursued by former Ministers in this country, he hoped to succeed in removing that distrust from their minds, and to gain their confidence and moral support. “ The policy of Her Majesty’s Government, he continued, had always been to strengthen Persia as much as possible, and maintaip her integrity; and the present appeared to him to be a favourable moment, while the boundary line in Turkestan was being agreed upon for securing that object by obtaining a formal assurance from the Russian Government that the Persian territory should not he encroached upon. A formal declaration in this sense made by Russia to Her Majesty’s Govern ment would be received with great satisfaction by Persia; but, if it could be so arranged that the assurance given by England should be also formally repeated by Russia, or be officially communicated to other European Powers at the same time, it would offer an additional guarantee, and be still more reassuring to the Persian Government.” “ Count Dubsky, the Austro-Hungarian Minister in Teheran, has assured the Sadr-Azem that his Government will endeavour to assist the Persian Government in carrying out this object, and he has also stated to me that Count Andrassy would be disposed to act in concert with Her Majesty’s Government, with a view to obtain from Russia'some guarantee for the maintenance of the integrity of Persia.” In reply to this Her Majesty’s Government acquainted that of the Shah, for the first time, of the understanding between England and Russia on the subject of the integrity of Persia, without, however, referring to the renewal of it in the year 1865. On the 26th of February 1873, Lord Granville wrote as follows to Mr. Thomson :— “ You will state to the Sadr-Azem that, without expressing an opinion as to the present bearing of what passed in 1834, Her Majesty’s Government think it would be highly inexpedient to make any observations to Russia which might imply a doubt as to the continued validity of the understanding of that year. Her Majesty’s Government consider that it would not be desirable without special cause, such as does not exist at present, to do anything to* Sir Andrew Buchanan had, on the 13th May 1873, drawn attention to Prince GorchakofPs “ recent assurances,” and stated his opinion that it would be extremely im politic of the Persian Government to raise any question which might imply any distrust of Russia, or any doubts as to her intention of respecting the integrity of Persia.

I should therefore be very grateful to your Lordship if you would com municate to the Government of His Majesty the Shah all that has passed between England and Russia on this subject.” Lord Granville wrote :— “ Although no formal agreement exists by which the two countries mutually agree to respect the integrity of Persia, yet in the year 1831, an under standing was arrived at between the two Govern ments on the occasion of the nomination of Mahomed Mirza as successor to the throne of Persia. That understanding was based on the sincere desire of the two Governments to maintain, not only the internal tranquillity, bid; also the independence and integrity of Persia, and in the year 1838, Count Nesselrode adverted to the agreement entered into by the two Governments as still subsisting in full force, as it was also acknow ledged to do by Her Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.” “ Her Majesty’s Government, as they recognize for themselves the principles which guided the general policy of Great Britain and Russia in favour of the independence and integrity of Persia in the year 1831, have reason to believe, from in formation which they have received from Lord Loftus, Her Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg, that the Russian Government refer with satisfaction to the mutual assurances which were made on this subject in 1831 and 1838. “ Her Majesty's Government consider that the best mode of confirming both Towers in those sen timents is that Persia, while steadily maintain* i/ng her rights as an independent Tower, should studiously fulfil in all respects her treaty engage- ments with each, and so ensure the continuance of the friendship which both Towers, even for their own interests, should desire to maintain with her.” Following upon this, Mr. Thomson, commenting on the reported alienation from Persia of the Teke Turcomans who had been previously regarded by Persia as Persian subjects, and having previously reported upon the indignation with which the Persian Government had heard of General Lomakin’s 6662. Qclaim to a supreme authority over all the Turcoman tribes of the Attrek and Gurgan, telegraphed home as follows:— “ The Shah instructed the Minister of Foreign Affairs to reply on this matter judiciously, which, as I read it, means not to admit pretensions of Russia, nor to claim Persian sovereignty over them. In my opinion, Persia is now totally unable to resist unaided any serious demand of Russia, even if it should be abandonment of the province of AstrabadI Henvey’s Precis, 1872—75, p. The inability to resist Russian demands was, properly speaking, in the Shah, his Ministers having, as is to be gathered from the above, shown an eager desire to obtain for His Highness the re quisite support of the foreign Powers, but especially that of Her Majesty’s Government, and the Shall, as it appears, acted on all emergencies under the prevailing Russian influence at Teheran. In October 1874 Lord Derby found it necessary to instruct Lord A. Loftus to call the attention of the Prussian Government to the circular of General Lomakin, in which the General styled himself Commander over the Turcoman tribes of the Attrek and Gurgan, and to point out that General Lomakin would not be justified in interfering in the territory between the two rivers, “ which was unquestionably “ Persian territory,” and “ a hope was to be ex- “ pressed that the Government of the Emperor “ would impress on General Lomakin the expediency ft of abstaining from molesting the tribes who “ frequent the country to the south of the Attrek. The Shah had in the meanwhile passed from London back to Teheran through St. Petersburg, impressed with the advice that he should studiously fulfil treaty engagements, as though Russia, and not Persia, were the aggrieved party, and the result of the representations made at St. Petersburg by Lord Augustus Loftus, as conveyed in the Despatch of the 17th November 1874 from Her Majesty’s Ambassador at the Russian Court, was that the Russian Government at first attempted to explain away the agreement of 1834, and “ did not admit “ the right of a third party to interfere in a question “ which solely regarded Persia.” “ It was not “ customary,” Mr. Westmann observed, “ to inter- “ fere in the international relations between two “ independent States, and he could not comprehend “ in what way the incident referred to could affect “ Great Britain.” The Russian Minister, referring to the same subject, so far did justice to Persia as to admit in December 1877 that “ it was Persia who was “ aggrieved,' adding that it was Persia “ who was “ entitled to seek an explanation.” In the year 1875, the Persian Government, having taken offence at the Russian military manoeuvres up the Sumbar branch of the Attrek to Chat and Karri Kala, and having assumed an attitude of resistance to the proposed establishment of a Russian station on the peninsula of Mian Kale under the pretext that the island of Ashurada was Ibid, p. 95.

Lord Derby to Mr. Thornton, 8th January 1875. 63 being submerged, entered into an animated ex change of notes with the Russian Government in maintenance of the rights of Persia as an inde pendent Power. In reference to the inseparability from Persia of the River Attrek and to the allegiance of the tribes inhabiting its vicinity, the Persian Poreign Minister addressed the Russian Minister at Teheran, as follows :— “ I most respectfully remind your Excellency that the arrangement of 1869 was sudden and tele graphic, the heads of matters were stated, but details were not entered into. It does not follow that, because the old established rights of Persia were not inserted therein, they should be made a subject for doubt and refutation. The fact that tribes move from place to place, which is an old usage and the mode of living of nomad people, does not deprive them of their allegiance to their lawful State; the Shah seven tribes of Persia, for instance, spend half the year in Russian territory, and Persian and Turkish tribes accommodate them selves to their summer or winter quarters by crossing over to the territories of both States, their respective nationalities remaining, as before, un altered. The doubt which has been suggested to your Excellency as to whether the tribes in question pay tribute to any one is unfounded; they have always been payers of tribute to Persia, and the amount due by them is registered and yearly col lected by the Astrabad authorities. If, owing to their wild habits and want of education, they occa sionally showed a rebellious spirit and refused to pay their tribute, they were soon compelled to do so by the Government of Astrabad. Therefore, as regards their allegiance to Persia, there cannot be, for us, the slightest doubt.” At this time, also, “ Her Majesty’s Government “ instructed Her Majesty’s Ambasador at St. Peters- “ burg to call the attention of the Russian Govern- “ to that part ” of another circular issued by General Lomakin to the Turcomans “in which he “ styles himself Governor over the territory lying “ between the Attrek and the Gurgan, when “ Mr. Westmahn assured Lord A. Loftus that the tc expression used by General Lomakin was purely a accidental.”* “ * General Lomakin’s Circular, of which Mr. Taylour Thompson has forwarded a copy, claims ‘ supreme authority * on the Attrek and Goorg^n by command of the Emperor of Russia. The cir cular purports to be addressed to the Ak Attabai, a branch of the Yomud tribe of Turcomans, whose habitation is in the neighbour hood of Asterabad, and Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran states that he has been informed on good authority that the circular has been sent to the whole of the Turcoman tribes occupying the line of country between the Caspian Sea, Mery, and the Oxus at Chardjoi. “ Your Lordship is aware that in March 1873, in the course of conversation on the subject of maintaining the integrity of Persia, M. de Stremoukhof placed in the hands of Lord Loftus a memo randum, in which, after reviewing what had passed on the subject of 1835 and 1838, he referred to Lord Palmerston’s note of 20th. 6662. R64 From the tone of the despatches addressed at this time by the Persian Government to that of Russia, it is to be inferred that the Persian Govern ment were exhibiting symptoms of irritation as much at the reflection in the Despatch of the 2nd July 1873, which seemed to have been implied in the advice to Persia to studiously fulfil her treaty engagements, when the Persian Government were complaining of the violation of their own rights by the Russian authorities, as by the hold pro ceedings of General Lomakin and by the audacious casuistry of the Russian Minister at Teheran. The Persian Government apparently felt embar rassed and shackled by the “sudden and tele- “ graphic ” arrangement of 1869, and chafed all the more under the flagrant “ disregard by the Russian authorities * of that arrangement, which the Russian Minister “ asserted to he so clear and “ sufficient/’ So acrimonious was the correspondence between the Persian and Russian Ministers, that a letter addressed by the Sadr-Azem to M. Beger had to be withdrawn because of the “ strong wording ” of it. Lord Salisbury had in the meanwhile considered it “ impossible for Her Majesty’s Government to “ accept the position of inaction which ” a letter from Prince Gorchakoff had “ apparently wished to “ force upon it,” while reserving to “ Russia full “ liberty of action upon every portion of territory “ situated between the Russian frontier and Af- “ ghanistan,” whereupon Lord Derby, being of opinion that the reply which was to be returned to Prince Gorchakoff should he “ very civilly, as “ well as cautiously drawn,” instructed Lord Augustus Loftus to express the most sincere satis faction with which Her Majesty’s Government had received “ assurances ” to the effect “ that “ general orders had been given that all future 44 action in these regions is to be strictly confined 44 to the defence of existing limits.” In maintenance of the rights of Persia, and in view of the fact that the Russians were reported as . 29th Earl to Mr. Thomson January 1873.

The following report was received at the English Embassy from the Mission Agent at Astrabad in December 1876:— “ The frontiers are kept in good order, and are quite safe, and each Turcoman tribe is en camped at its own place. The Prince Governor is encamped at Ak-Kala with his troops, and is engaged in collecting the annual taxes and revenue from the Turcomans. No Governor has, up till now, been able to levy such a tax from the Turcoman tribes as that which is now taken. The Prince Governor is taking eleven tomans from each family of the other Turcoman tribes, al though Sulieman-Khan, the former Governor, last year was not able to collect eleven krans from each family. “ The Prince Governor is very diligent in all affairs relating to the frontier. He has laid claim to most of the places lying on the sea coast between the Gurgan and the Attrek, which the Russians have possessed up till now, and has entrusted Mohammed-Kuli Khan, Darogah of the Jaferbai Turcomans, to collect the revenue of these places.” In January 1877, the Russian authorities called upon the Tekes of Akhal for an explanation of the overtures which they had made to Persia, and although the Emperor positively forbad the ex pedition recommended in April 1876 by the Grand Duke Michael, General Lomakin, after summon ing to his presence certain of the Tek6 Elders, and issuing a proclamation to the nomads, which was written in Turkish, marched into Akhal, where he engaged in a combat with the Turcomans, and gaining a victory,, called upon the people of Kari- Kala and Nukhur to acknowledge allegiance to Russia. The Persian Government hereupon represented both to the Russian Minister and to Her Majesty’s Government, that both of the above-named places belonged to Bujnurd, and that the Upper Attrek valley was occupied by Persian Kurds. The Russian Minister gave evasive assurances to the effect that Russia would not take possession of any places to which Persia had a just claim, and to Mr. Thomson, the Persian Minister, declared that the Persian Government, having directed the Goklans of Kari-Kala to adhere to their declaration that they were Persian subjects under a document which they held to that effect, “ would maintain &lt;£ the justice of their claim to all the territory along “ the valley of the Upper Attrek, and would now “ protest most formally against all interference66 “ with it if Her Majesty’s Government would give ** them their moral support at St. Petersburg, on * ( the ground of the understanding between the two u Governments to respect the integrity of Persian “ territory.” . . ^ . , , Her Majesty’s Government having obtained, trom the Emperor of Hussia the most formal assurances that no further hostilities in the direction of the Turcoman country were intended, the “ bliah, “ stating his appreciation of the friendly support “ accorded by Her Majesty’s Government,’ was “ indisposed to enter into discussion now with the *« Russian Government,” and although General Lomakin had but recently, in obedience to the commands of the Grand Duke Michael, conducted another expedition to the country of the Upper Attrek in defiance as it were of the commands to the contrary of His Imperial Majesty, both “ the “ Shah and the Persian Ministers were,” as tele graphed by Mr. Thomson, “apparently apprehen- ° sive ” at this period “ of exasperating Russia by formally protesting at the present moment. This, properly speaking, closes the period ot a.11 attempts on the part of the Shah’s Government to resist Russian encroachments in violation ot the rights of Persia. The Russo-Turkish war and the Afghan wars interrupted all further inter-correspondence between the three Governments of England, Persia, and Russia on the subject of the rights of Persia m the Attrek and Gurgan valleys. All interest was then transferred to Merv, and on this point nothing more was extracted from t e Russian Government than general assurances that there was no intention of advancing to Merv, and that “ the sovereign and territorial rights of Persia “ should be respected.” . The convention signed by the Russian Minister at Teheran and the Persian Minister for Eoreign Affairs shows how much of Persian territory has been acquired by Russia, and how much will lapse 4-^.

The first part (folios 26-41) outlines Russian activities and aims in the Trans-Caspian region from 1716-1880; it narrates the extension of Russian influence over the Turcoman [Turkmen] tribes in the region to their eventual absorption into the Russian Empire to form part of Transcaspia. As a result it includes information concerning Russian military expeditions and various efforts made by them to coerce the Turcomen tribes into becoming Russian subjects, and some of the Turcoman efforts to resist. More especially it includes details on the establishment of a Russian naval base at Ashurada and the Russian occupation of Krasnovodsk [Turkmenbashi].The second part (folios 42-48) concerns attempts by the Turcoman tribes to seek the protection of either Afghanistan or Persia. It includes a translation of a document (folios 44v-47) sent by Adul Hassan Khan, Governor of Kuchan, to Rukn-ud-dowla, Governor of Khorassa, which concerns the submission of the Teke tribes of Atamish and Tokhtamest to Persia; a Russian take on the situation claiming that the tribes rejected the Persian offer is included alongside. The terms of an agreement between the Shah of Persia and the Merv [Mary] Teke — in which the latter become Persian subjects — is located on folios 47v-48.The third part (folios 49-52) focuses on the attempts by the Amir of Afghanistan, Shrere-Ali-Khan [Sher Ali Khan], to seek British protection against Russian aggression; the Amir is concerned that a Russian advance on the Merv would be a prelude to an attack on Afghanistan, or that the Russians may pursue any retreating Turcoman into Afghanistan.The fourth and final part (folios 53-58) outlines Persia's efforts to secure its northern frontier against Russian encroachment, and the interventions that the British have made to assist with this resistance. It also discusses diplomatic exchanges to affect a joint Anglo-Russian agreement to maintain the integrity of Persia.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commander of Russian Forces in the Trans-Caspian</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Khan of Khiva</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Russian Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Tekke (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Turkmen</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000ca#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
