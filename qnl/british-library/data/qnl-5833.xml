Dear Gunter , It appears to me that it is a very anomalous position that Kuwait which is :uite outside Ira and totally distinct irom it should have an Ina ost and Telegraph oilice. Before the war as you know there was an Indian ost Office there and no telegraph office though a wireless station was in course of construction. Even now the people of Kuwait do not like having an Ira post office and it has to disguise its existence so to speak by using Indian stamps surcharged Kuwait ' 1 wanted to ask you whether it would be feasible to run a land line from the Indo-European Telegraph Department station at pao across to Kuwait or to join on to the pie sent Basra h~K.uwai t line somewhere and absorb it. 1 £ this could be done we could have a combined Indian post and telegraph office as there is at Bandar jobas , . Qwadur and other places in the Indo-European Telegraph Departmenr system in the Gull. If it is feasible perhaps you could wire me ana I will put the m tter- tentatively up to Government. Sd / — xx.

I agree entirely with what you say about the absurdity of its being run by ’Iraq, and, as you know, I have always disliked It. The threat to raise the telegraph!® rate to Baghdad If Kuwait became an Indian telegraph office, which made me think twice in dv'U (see siy ne&amp;ior&amp;ndusn No.7 iJ/iC/i of A-iS-ii), now leaves ne quite cold, as I do not supjiose 1 send a dozen wires to ’Iraq a year now, and the reduction in postage would more than compensate for that. I think that not only I, but the general public of Kuwait as well, would welcome the proposed change. The only loss they woult suffer would be the Inc reus eu rates for telegr^ me a tun. letters to ’Iraq amt the facility for tele^ra.hdng in Arabic to Iraq, but in ail other respects they would score, and trie establishment of an efficient Money Order service with India alone would be worth the change (at present the honey Order service - except to * Iraq - is so slow as to be almost useless There would, I di\re say, be some alight administrative difficulties to be overcome, out no unsurmountab!e ones: e.g. I presume the Indo-European Telegraph Department would then3^ take over the na inters nee of the line Kuwait to Zubair, an^. keep a linesman at each enit - or with 1 Iraq to ao the northern half wiien necessary. (At iTesent if any work 1 b required on the line, I arrange for with toe bhalkii for &amp; e mel ^ gui m for toe man who lives here, ana he goes out as far as s&amp;blyah where he meets the man frost ^.ubair;. The disposal of the takings too would have to be thought of • At P r «««nt the 1 Iran Postal Department keep a special &amp; n to take the treasure to Basrah • he goes by one boat and coses ek by the next. Kven now I take over a certain aiount of tb tula in silver: but everyone who has any notes usee the Post Office to get rid of then when the exchange is not favourable ana notes are of no use to me. 1 presume too thit the fact of this becoming an Indian jost. Office would not prevent our aukin* use of the •a^hdad - Haifa Overland Jail, whleh, for ones private use is a ^reat boon. ° na benefit to me, toieh you will not have thougiit of, woulci be the abolition of the surcharged stamps, and the release from the importunities of stamp collectors.

Bi ve days ago he was still in Kuweit, living in a small house by himself in the mahallat el Qiblah. It appears that he travelled to Kuweit via the khor Abdul' lah in the company of a Kuweit man named Ahmed es oummeit, and upon their arrival he stayed with this man; but Ahmea es oummeit, .t having weaned his story from him, got alarmed and thought that per- it haps he might be implicated in harbouring a criminal and so gave information to the Sheikh of Kuweit. Upon this Ibrahim Baris was imprisoned, but an influential man there called Abdullah Aziz es Subih intervened on his behalf and pointed out to the oheikh that as no official news had come from pasrah regarding this man he ought not to be imprisoned merely on suspicion. The Sheikh then released the man, and Abdul A^iz es Subih arranged for him to live in a small house near his own and sends food to him every day. In the meantime, Ibrahim i?aris is making strenuous efforts to obtain money, either from his father, Boos a j?aris, in oombay, or from his uncle Abdulla r aris in ^ubair, to enable him to pay his obligations in Kuweit and proceed to Syria; he is entirely without money now, I am informed. § lit .

He then ?itharew the obsei- vat ion as he had heard nothing from me about hin. This was f o or or five days before J received your original telegram about him, 'iVhen I wrote to him, he ordered enquiries to be made, and it was re x &gt;orted to him that Ibrahim had hired a camel and left for Najd, He readily believed this, as it is whiit Ahmad aa~Sum&amp;it had warned him he was thinking of doin^ when he first lodged information about him He tmmieed to £&gt;entl for 'Abdul *Azia a»*Subih at once aid z y make the strictest •nquiries.

He says that ’Abdul 'ArIsj as-Subih makes no secret of having befriendea him, but not since it was known that he was wanted, by the Police in B?s m as he had left Kuwait some days before I wrote about him*He has verified this from various other sources«£ nm not at all satisfied In my o%n mind about thl&amp; c^ae aa auo:. a lot of the infonaation in the enclosure to your memorandum la oorreot, and I am tele^ra^ln^ to aak you if any real proof ia available that Ibrahim was in Kuwait f 1 ve days before the ^llectpr of Cuetocifc wrote you hie letter.

The German Ambassador in London has recently - made enquiries from His Majesty’s Government as to 'what l restrictions are enforced with regard to the entry and settlement of German nationals in the mandated territory of Iraq and the states of the Arabian Peninsula under British influence”. His Majesty’s Government have asked the Government of India for their views as to the reply which should be returned to this enquiry,and the Political Resid- -ent has now been asked to let the Government of India have his views on the subject. As you know, there are no restrictions on the entry of Germans into the Arab States with .which we have treaty relations on the shores of the Persian Gulf which do not also apply to British subjects and the subjects of any other Power. And one of the chief considerations on which permission to enter these States depends is the consent of the Shief concerned. I am to ask you therefore to approach the Shaikh of Kuwait at a suitable opportunity and enquire from him how he would regard the entry and settlement in his territory2 of German nationals, and to report the result to the Political Resident as soon as possible.

No such flight is at present contemplated but it is important that, if possible, sufficient information should be available to render one practicable at short notice without previous reconnaissance or specie.! arrangements. Whether this is practicable or not you will be able to tell us after getting: information together. There is, so -^ur as we know, no map that can be relied on but would relcome t , od_ opinion as to the best available. 4s you are both experienced Intelligence Officers it would seem unnecessary to give you any further direcbicns e~.eept to remind you of special points as regards aeroplanes '*ich may Be briefly detailed as follows: (] ) Visibility of existing tracks from the air and tueir value as guides over various sections of the route. Branch tracks which would 'be liable to lead astray. (2) Recognisable land-marks and distances between teem. Rough points of the compass as far as they can he given. ...is will naturally include any recognizable hills, village.., visibl wells, Wadis, tracts of ground of peculiar colour or formation etc. ( 3 ) Areas on the route on which landings should be practicable with special note of particularly suitable places. 1 . fspecially those near water. Surfaces likely to deceive from the air if existent should he specially mentioned. 4 . Any air conditions that might affect the flight, prevailing winds, storms etc with areas if sphere is limited. 5 . Notes as to probable reception of aviators if planes are forced to land along the route and advice as to attitude aviators should adopt or any documents they should carry or names trey should mention. You may he able to think of other information to add and such might admit of a rough diagramatic map being made. It would, of course, he practicable to send a special officer dorm to get this, inforriation but it seemed to me, as members of the old firm that you would loth rather resent this and moreover I felt that you would both do it better yourselves from all points of view. Should you require any assistance would you kindly wire at once? When the flight goes down the Officer Commanding should examine the information you have and go into it with you personally pointing out any of the ways he would wish it supplemented if possible.

Used extensively as it ir, too, there would be at least a possibility of following the road for part of the way between Hasa and RiySdh, whereas there would be no tracks of any value on th e route from Kuwait. In the case of hostilities with Ibn Sa’ud, it would be a n additional advantage to pass over Hasa, as it is the place 1 n Najd where disaffection towards Itn Ba'dd would be most likely to break out. an a nrntter of fact, in this caoe Kuwait might be ruled out at once on account of ita extra distance, as the aeroplanes would have to return without landing I find it difficult to conceive any conditions under which Ibn Sa'ud wqaiq desire aeroplanes to visit RiySdh, as he would naturally not wish such a powerful weapon, of which he himself has none, to be paraded before his people. I assume therefore that a flight from Kuwait to Riyadh would on 1 / be attempted if Ibn SaSid had been previously per* suaded * probably against his wishes - to grant his perm is * sion, to warn all tribes along the route, and to have the most suitable landing ground at Riyadh marked out. Even so f aviators if* forced lo / C rrzcl en Diight not be well received, though in that case Ibn Sa*ud would \ no doubt express the keenest regret afterwards. In any case( 2 ).

The Government of India have noticed from the Audit Reports for relating to Central Transactions, submitted by the various Accounts Officers, that there has been a marked increase in the number of cases of embezzlement and fraud and also of thefts of Government money in several provinces, some of which are of a serious nature. For example, the Accountants General, x Madras and Central Revenues, have each mentioned one case in which money was fraudulently drawn from the Treasury on present- -ation of forged payment orders. The Accountant-General, —-— * * ide pages 3 and 11-13, respectively, : Punjab again has reported a case of their reports : *** — in which pensions of certain ide page 2 of his Report. : — ■—-— deceased Political pensioners were allowed to be drawn for over 20 years, on the strength of false life certificates purporting to have been furnished by the pensioners. In addition, cases of misappropriation of Govern- -ment money by falsification of accounts and of loss of money by r thefts have been many. The Government of India have observed that generally the embezzlement or the perpetration of the fraud has been facilitated by the lack of effective supervisinn on the part of executive officers concerned. I am to express the hope that the Gover nmen t of Madras, e tc, will impress on all executive you officers the urgent necessity of a strict supervision to ensure the effective prevention of embezzlement and fraud and that it will be emphasised that serious disciplinary action will be taken against those found guilty of bad supervision.7-11 /) s £X J-Oy ctuv ioar 156 - 3 .

The case occurred hetfi&amp;re my arrival here and was dealt with hy the Mutasarrif, who states that he sent for the hoy and his master,who is from Beit Hasaam. The latter strenuously denied having sent the hoy for sale to Ahdulla Al-Nafisi. The hoy was therefore set free and went hack to Zuhair. A few days later he returned to Basrah, and work was found for him with Yousif Ahdul Ahad, a Christian Notable. jhe hoy worked here for some time and again left.

In continuation of this officer ho. 110/C,of April 28th. ihe servant of Khalil Bakir, named Jasim Abu Shahr, who was reported to have brought the Armenian women from r/uwait, has recently again been in Bahrain. I am informed that he told several epople that he had taken five Armenian women from Al Max isi at Kuwait. Two had been bought for Bin luana f at Doha, two for Khalil Baqir’s father at Doha and one was taken there for sale. The latter had not yet been sold. The women had all been brought in to Kuwait' from the interior, (doubtless some of the many sold to the tribes by the Turks during the War) to Hafisi. I think there is little doubt that the transaction took place and it appears to have been carried out in a very brazen manner, as the women were brought down by B.I. Steam- -er. Perhaps if a stiff letter were written to the Ruler of Qatar he might be induced to send them here for inquiry. They could be lodged at the Mission and sent to one of the Armenian Homes in Baghdad or elsewhere. Perhpas even if they were not recovered it would be a good thing to let it be known that traffic of this nature cannot be carried on with impunity and is liable to be found out. Or if you think it better I could tackle Khalil bin B a q/ir here and insist on his having them brought back ? or a combination of the two, a letter to the Ruler of Qatar, and my speaking to Khalil bin Baqir here would have eifect r EPolitical Agency, Bahrain, dated 7th July 192&lt; The political Agent, Koweit. if X Si «-./ / \\ 0- v^s /0-7-M Meaorandum* C J In continuation of my Memorandum Ho. 525 dated 28-6-24, I no\ forward herewith the 2nd of Exchange of Draft for Rs. 16,875/- sent to you by the last mail.

AM The Air Officer Commanding desires me to express his thanks for your hospitality and assistance to the officers and men of the three aeroplanes which recently visited Kowait. Squadron Leader Peck raised the question of the disposal of the petrol, oil and spares which were left under your charge: You will appreciate the fact that even a small supply of petrol and oil at Kowait makes a considerable difference to the employ ment of aircraft in your vicinity and enables machines to be despatched at short notice without waiting for the shipment of fuel to Kowait. You will recollect that last spring a request was made for reconnaiss ances over Kowait territory and perhaps the same m occur again. On the other hand to raise the question officially would appear to be inopportune, as it is non-British soil, and most unlikely to lead to any result. The most satisfactory method from our point of view would be for you to arrange a contract for the construction of a petrol store and store shed in some convenient place near your quarters where the petrol, oil and spares could be locked up. The cost of this building will naturally be the responsibility of this command. Would proposals and if shed and forward Group, Royal Air D.

Sir, I am commanded by the Air Council to refer to Sir John Shuchburgh’s letter of the 15th instant desiring to be informed of the views of the Air Council regarding the possibility of the Hoyal Air Force aeroplanes which are about to visit Bahrain carrying out a demonstration flight over Hejd territory. Ihe Council understand this proposal to mean that the aircraft, having accomp- -lished the flight to Bahrain, should use that place fxx as a base for a subsequent flight to Biyadh, rather than it would suffice if any part of Bejd territory should be traversed en route to Bahrain. This will more clearly appear from the letter dated the 1st instant from the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq, a copy of which with its acoompan/ying memorandum is enclosed herewith. It will be seen from this letter that Biyadh itself is beyond the range of aircraft operating from any base a$ present under British control, and the Air Council assume that no useful purpose would be served in existing circoxastance^ hj a flight which did not demonstrate the accessibility of Riyadh and the Has a Oasis. 2. Regarding the possibility of carrying out such a flight from Bahrain, while it is clear that careful pre paration would be required the Council foresee no serious technical Hie Under Secretary of S tate, Colonial Office, S.W.l*technical difficulties in the waymX of either a friendly Ticit as now contemplated, or, should the necessity at any time arise, of offensive air action as discussed in the enclosed memorandum. The question of arranging a friendly visit is therefore mainly dependent on polit- -ic&amp;l considerations and on this aspect the Council would be glad to be acquainted with the views of the Secretary of state for the Colonies. If Hr. Thomas is of opinion that the visit is politically feasible and if the necessary diplomatic arrangements can be made the Council would suggest that the visit should be arranged to take plawe in the early summer if possible.

Air Headquarters, Iraq Command, Baghdad. 1st April 1924. To The Secretary, Air Ministry, Ad&amp;stral House, Kingsway, W.C.2. Shaikh Kariad the Shaikh of Bahrain, is anxious to receiY© a visit from British aircraft and on the recommendation of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, His Kxcellency the High Commissioner raises no objection. A landing ground has been placed at our dispos and a flight by three J&gt;.H.9a8. is being carried out as soon as preliminary arrangements are completed. Apart from the view of cementing relations with Bahrain and offsetting the impression which has been ereat- -ed by the arrival of six French aeroplanes at Bushire for Persia, it is considered that this offers an opportunity of establishing an aerodrome at Bahrain which may be of particular value to us subsequently as afc alternate station on the route to India or as a potential Inland air base in case of any operations in the Persian Gulf. Its establishment will bring Riyadh, Ibn Baud 1 © capital in ffi wy d the Bejb, within air striking distance. Ibn Baud is well aware that there is at present no British controlled aerodrome from which he can be reached by air- -craft. dhen this aerodrome is established it Is consideredhit* h considered that a friendly air visit night materially affect Ibn Saud*s future policy. The attached memorandum outlines a proposal for such a visit and is submitted for the consideration of the Ait Council. It has already been before His Excellency the High Commissioner who Is entirely in agreement with regard to a friendly air visit to Eiyadh, although the arguments with which he would support the proposal are not entirely in accordance with those contained w&amp;frfr &lt; tmiioei, uuiitallTffd in the memorandum. It December last when this memorandum was originally written His Kxcsllency wished me to wait to see how the Koweit conference developed. Hi© Excellency did not anticipate that Ibn Saud would regard the suggest- -ion with any favour, but it is thought that even if the proposal fails it will have had the effect of bringing &amp; new situation into Ibn Baud’s mind. *he early summer would be the best time for the visit to Riyadh. (Sd) J. M. SAU10HD. Air Marshall, Air Officer Commanding Iraq Command. Cojy to Hie Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq, The residency, Baghdad.raiPY SSCHIJ_. A PROPOSAL K)H AH AIR VISIT Tp im BAUD AT HIS CAPITAL . 'ilie Bubsidy to I^bn Baud is coming to an end just at a time when his policy seems to clash with British policy in a number of ways, and His Britannic Majesty’s Government are undoubtedly much concerned at the present much time to find some alternative an&amp;^cheaper means of influencing him. He has differences with Eedjaz, Trans-Jordania and Iraq and his policy conflicts both with our own Imper- -i&amp;l policy as respects Arabia generally and with our policy as mandatory in Iraq. when the time comes for the British Goverment to withdraw from Iraq and for Faisal and his Government to stand on their own it will be more than ever necessary to be able to control him or influence him. Ibn Baud’s aspirations towards Mecca, again, cannot be ignored by us as a Mohammedan power. 'he only means of influencing him which are being considered at present are simple diplomatic pressure and in the last resort Stoppage of supplies fro® Iraq. The former must come to an end at no distant date because it has at present no ultima ! 'e visible backing of ioice. f The latter will be worthless once we leave Iraq. he best way on every conceivable count of maintaining an Influence over Ibn Baud is through the air arm, and this does not y*y as yet wee® to have been considered bv che authorities concerned. Two proposals are therefore submitted:- (1) That the feasibility so far as service consider- -ations are concerned of attacking Ibn Saud from the air, if it should ever be necessary to take arms against him, should be suggested to the Air Ministry for the information of the Foreign and Colonialu &amp; C» Colonial fiices, so that these offices can hear the matter «in the hack of their minds'. (2) iliat it should he suggested through His Excell- -ency the High Coiamissloner to Colonial and Foreign Offices that a political visit should he conveyed hy air next \pril to Ihn Baud’s capital at Biy&amp;dh. The first proposal is independent of the second and consists in the first place merely forwarding for consideration of the Mr Staff a description in outline of a possible scheme for an air offensive against Ihn Baud’s capital and the small townships adjoining it and his wealth centre in the Hasa oasis. For this a convenient base exists at Bahrain and the problem is relatively a simple one. D.H.9&amp;S. with extra tankage, and air relief organization for forced landdd machines, well set compasses meteorological organisations and possibly the location of a W/T direction-location service {though this is not perhaps a real necessity) are all that need be provided, while supply to Bahrain ahauld involve no real difficulties. If the Foreign Office were to be made aware of these potentialities of the air arm, wnieh - thi• s possibly not yet the case, it might greatly strengthen their hattd in dealing with Ibn Baud, while even though the stiggestion were never to be put into action, ics eicao representation would offer a useful and timely example to the Government of the potentialities of the Hew Service. For to reach Ibn Baud’s capital by any other means would prove a very expensive and highly inconvenient and olabor- - a te undertaking, while by air his capital can be readily attacked at short notice and very low cost and vviiliouu chance of serious loss. TheIII The second suggestion is one for execution next spring hy this command and requires elaboration. The idea is that a political visit, entirely friendly and complimentary and without any embarrassing or difficult differences to discuss, should be conveyed by air to Ibn Baud in his capital at Riyadh. Tentatively the composition of the Mission might be (l) A representative of His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq. (ii) The British Agent at Bahrain. Bote - Which of these should hatre charge of the Mission involves diplomatic considerations which need not be weighed here. e (ill) A fluent Arabic speaking officer as representativi of the Air Officer Commanding. (iv) Possibly a British representative of the Iraq Government, though this again involves consider- -ation of the exact complexion which it might be most desirable to give to the Mission. (v) Wireless operator. The conveyance of this visit by air might be expected to achieve the following results: Ibn Baud is a shrewd and able man, and would be quick to realise from the friendly presence of these aircraft that they might also visit his capital on another occasion with a less welcome load, and at a few hours notice. He has not yet contemplated the possibility that he could be reached at all, and it would incline him to listen with more immediate respect to our advice. Thustfius, the visit might prepare his mind to abandon any hopes he may have against the -ashimite House in general at the present time, and in particular against Iraq after we have He will realise that so long as we can use Bahrain he is very much at our mercy, he might be less inclined to foment trouble on the Iraq border and more ready to see the wisdom of settling the outstanding issues on all his frontiers. Indirectly the visit by giving us a powerful lever over the chief enemy and rival of the family of Hussain might incline that family more readily to keep in with us as a possible source of protection, after our various mandates are fulfilled. Our ability by the air to safeguard the Holy Cit* of Mecca from attack by Wahabi© might be useful throughout India, and a similar power in the case of Haj&amp;f and Karbala might be useful a© an Influence in Iraq after we have left. -er advantage in pressing British ndnrmilitary and non- •Governmental influence in Central Arabia - ”Trade follows the Flag”. which might be drawn from it :• (i) Whereas the presentation of a scheme for an air offensive against Riyadh would be of value as an example of potentialities which could be claimed by believers in air power, the air visit would be an actual object lesson which could not be gainsaid. (11) It would have a distinct training value. (ill) The Air Ministry }?ublieity Department and the Royal Geographical Society would be able to make very good The visit might be the beginning of quite anoth- here are several other and indirect advantages useuse of air photographs of an inaccessible city visited so far by less than twelve white men in all. A possible objection may be anticipated. The Iraq Government might be frightened of a friendly visit by the British to Ibn Baud. mis is a bogey rather than a difficulty and might be exorcised by a little healthy explanation of the results to be gained from it. It is really much more likely that the Iraq authorities will be only too eager for such a demonstration to be made. Moreover by showing Ibn Baud that we are prepared to come and see him and give him a chance to H make friends* and have some intimate and quite unofficial talks and explain his own point of view, the way might be paved for mutual good understending between all concerned. To view things from his standpoint might give our own author- -itiea at home a useful view of Arabian affairs from another aspectCopy of a Despatch Ho. 26/387-S, dated the 6th July 1924, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for the Colonies. Proposed visit of Royal Air Force aeroplanes to Hejd. 1 have the honour to refer to your despatch of the 16th May 1924 regarding (l) Colonel Trevor’s proposal that when Royal Air Force Aeroplanes next visited Bahrain they should make from that base a demonstration flight over Riyadh, and (2) Sir John Salmond’e proposal that a Mission, representing the High Commission for Iraq, this Residency, the Air Force and the Iraq Government, should pay a visit, entirely friendly and complimentary, by air in the early summer of 1924 to Ibn Baud at l iyadh. Your despatch reached me on the 11th June, and the Flight of aeroplanes had arrived in Bahrain on the 8th June. The dangerous season of Shimals (Horth-Westerly winds) had set in. It was obviously impossible for the Flight to attempt a visit to Hejd this summer. 1 therefore deferred replying to you until al ex had consulted Major Daly, the Political Agent in Bahrain. I submit the following observations. A demonstration flight to Riyadh and bac^r, from Bahrain, without landing, is believed to be out of the question. If Ibn Saud were asked at the present time to receive the friendly visit of a JilsBion anywhere west of Hasa he would excuse himself on various grounds. ne would recognise the moral effect of such a visit upon his own subjects, as he encourages his Bedouin to believe not only that he is invincible but also that he is immune from attacks and reprisals. Thej 7 j me Sultan, s practice of late years has been to spend a few months of the cold weather in Hasa. W e think that a visit to Hofuf next autumn might he suggested. If he agrees* the visit would he a comparatively simple matter. During the visit it would be convenient i to expatiate on the ease with which he could he visited in Riyadh. Even if an invitation to proceed there does not follow, uhe iaet that the suggestion was made will not be lost on him. Should he refuse to receive a Mission in Hasa, i- could he suggested to him that perhaps it would he more convenient for him to receive the visit in Riyadh or else- -where in the interior 2 It is quite possible that the Buitan, who has heard by now of Shaikh Hamad of Bahrain*s flight in a plana may agree to the proposed visit to Hasa, and that after the Flight’s arrival there he may extend his invitation and even accept the offer of a passage to Riyadh. I agree that most beneficial results should follow from such &amp; visit. With regard to the proposed composition of the Mission, I think that one senior Political Officer should suffice. It is not siery material whether he belongs to Iraq or the Gulf, though before starting he should have Interviews with the heads of both Administrations.SECRET. To Eo. 390-S of 1924.
