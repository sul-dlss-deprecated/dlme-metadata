Stannus writes with regret that the peace negotiations agreed between the tribes of the Arab coast have not yet been fully carried through. He also states that his planned visit to Aboothabee [Abu Dhabi] was put off after receiving (erroneous) intelligence that Shaikh Tahnoon [Tahnun bin Shakbut] was in fact in Magoo [Moghuyeh], to which he proceeded instead. Stannus also reports on the current state of affairs between Raḥmah bin Jābir and Bahrain, and Wahhabi activity in the region. At the end of his letter, Stannus recommends for consideration by the Government the formalising of the general prohibition of hostilities at sea, imposed by the British upon the Arab tribes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054933.0x000039#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
