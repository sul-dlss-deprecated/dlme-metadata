These charms were intended to provide protection from specific dangers. Amulets of birth-gods, for example, were believed to protect women during pregnancy and childbirth and to watch over a newborn in the first years of life. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the Eighteenth Dynasty, certain amulets began to be placed within mummy bandages to guarantee life after death. The most common included <i>wedjat</i>-eyes, signifying the restoration of wholeness; <i>tyt</i>-amulets, emblems of the goddess Isis, who restored her dead husband Osiris to life; and flowers, traditional symbols of fertility. Beads inscribed with a person&rsquo;s name ensured that the memory of the individual would survive throughout eternity. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo-called heart scarabs, known since the Thirteenth Dynasty, are frequently found on New Kingdom mummies. The Egyptians believed that a deceased person&rsquo;s fate would be determined by weighing his or her heart against the &ldquo;Feather of Truth&rdquo; on a divine balance. Texts carved on heart scarabs prevented the deceased&rsquo;s heart from revealing anything negative during the weighing ritual.", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2016-03-01", "date_added": "2016-04-12 17:02:44", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "05.326", "object_id": 3210}, {"accession_number": "44.123.144", "object_id": 3476}, {"accession_number": "37.255E", "object_id": 3996}, {"accession_number": "37.479E", "object_id": 4042}, {"accession_number": "37.480E", "object_id": 4043}, {"accession_number": "37.807E", "object_id": 4103}, {"accession_number": "37.965E", "object_id": 4118}, {"accession_number": "37.1272E", "object_id": 4131}, {"accession_number": "37.1287E", "object_id": 4133}, {"accession_number": "37.1298E", "object_id": 4134}, {"accession_number": "37.1323E", "object_id": 4136}, {"accession_number": "37.1441E", "object_id": 4151}, {"accession_number": "37.1462E", "object_id": 4154}], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 6863634, "name": "Egypt", "type": "Place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "CUR.16.323_NegL1005_8_print_bw.jpg", "id": 136312, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/CUR.16.323_NegL1005_8_print_bw.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/CUR.16.323_NegL1005_8_print_bw.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 96, "height": 68}, {"size": "1", "width": 192, "height": 136}, {"size": "2", "width": 384, "height": 272}, {"size": "3", "width": 768, "height": 544}, {"size": "4", "width": 1536, "height": 1089}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/CUR.16.323_NegL1005_8_print_bw.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em></em>, ca. 1539-1075 B.C.E.
