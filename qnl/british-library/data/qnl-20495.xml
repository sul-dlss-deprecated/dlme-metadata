If however, we can get him to cancel the E.G.S. concession, I do €it n(To) ( 2 ) (oomuuEP) not think that anyone else ia likely to endeavour to obtain it; and we shall then he able to wait until Ibn Sand or (if, as I think 'by no means improvable, Ms kingdom 'breaks up) the future ruler of the Hassa prorinoe is really hard-up for money. If Ion Saud cancels the E.G.S. concession, our prospects in Koweit and Bahrain will be favourably affected. It would be of great assistance if you could let us know definitely whether Holmes has paid to Ibn Saud the money due within 60 days of the signature of the Concession and whether he has produced - or is about to produce - any geologists or other persons in fulfilment of his undertaking to start work within o months of the signature of the ooncession. If we could definitely establish that he has not done so, it would be of great assistance to us in driving home the argument that the B.G.S. is financially incapable of working the concession and that Ibn Saud would there fore do well to get out of it as soon as he can; thus leaving the field free for others to make offers.

I am, however, to add that in any case, Mr, Thomas regards the present time as unsuitable on general political grounds for such negotiations and that, for the present, it would be impossible to accord any applicant permission to proceed. He does not anticipate that the situation will be sufficiently clear for such permission to be feasible in the immediate future. Mr. Thomas desires me to express his regret at the delay which has occurred in answering your letter. This delay was due to the necessity for communicating with other Government Departments and with His Majesty's Government's representatives in the Persian Gulf. 1 am, etc., (Sgd.) J.E.SHUCKBURGH.

Sir, We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of | your letter Ho.3697/24 of the 4th instant regarding our claim for priority in respect of oil concessions in the territory of the Sheiidi of Qatar. 2. In the second paragraph of your letter under reply you state that 'the area in question was not covered by the language used in the first paragraph of your letter to the Foreign Office of the 12th May 1921. in as ^Ch a S the Sheikh of Qatar is not one of the rulers commonly known as the Trucial Chiefs'. U has always been our impression that the Sheikh of qatar is. in fact, one of these Chiefs, . and the language of our letter to the Foreign Office referred to above was certainly intended to cover his territory as well as that of the other rulers of the Trucial Coast. 3. We note with satisfaction, however, that the Secretary of State is prepared to recognise the priority of our application in respect of Qatar as well as of the other areas mentioned in our letter to the Foreign Office of the 12th May 1921. i 4. we appreciate the fact that the recognition of a claim to priority does not initself constitute permission to engage in active negotiations, and we note that the I Secretary of State does not regard the situation in Qatar as ^eing. or as likely in the near future to become, sufficiently clear to make it desirable that negotiations shouldshould be instituted. We will, of course, refrain from instituting any negotiations for an oil concession in Qatar until we hear from you that we are at liberty to do so. In this connection, we venture, however, to remind you that the Eastern and General Syndicate were desirous several months ago of applying for a concession irom the Sheikh of Qatar* Moreover, we understand that Major Holmes, the agent of the above-mentioned Syndicate, is in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf with the object of negotiating concessions. We trust therefore that our compliance with your request to abstain from any attempt to secure the oil rights in qatar will not react to our disadvantage, as similar action on our part unfortunately did in the cases of our negotiations for concessions in Kejd and Kuwait.

Secretary Thomas to inform you that a despatch has now been received fro® the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in regard to your Company's negotiations with the Sheikh of Kuwait for an oil concession in hie territory. 2. The Resident reports that during his last visit to the Sheikh on the 29th of November in cora- pargr with the Political Agent, he discussed the ques tion of the concession, and that the Sheikh's reply was received early in January, in which he stated that as far as he could see it would be impossible to give a ioil reply in regard to the terms of the concession for sii months. The Political Resident, therefore, asked the Sheikh in writing why he considered it necessary MTrLO PERSIAN OIL GOMPANT, LIMITID.necessary to postpone the matter for such a long period, and later called on the Sheikh and dis cussed the matter verbally. The Sheikh stated that he was going into every clause in grea^ detail and obtaining the opinions of various local persons about different points that aror.e, and that he feared he might not be able to give a studied reply for the ■ i m | l best part of six months* 3. You have probably received informtion to ||i th® same effect from your Representative, but in case B this is not so, Mr. Thomas desires me to inform you in the above sense and also to express his regret that SiE ■ through no fault of this Department the negotiations 112 1 I appear likely to be protracted.

P ^ O . C had not applied since he had refused their first application &amp; he did notsr intend to grant them a concession. On I4/3 Major Holmes called on me &amp; said he wished to shew me the correspondance he had had with ^haik Hamad f with a view to ascertaining for the information of his directors ,how the matter stood. He showed me the letter referred to by Hamad,in which [Ma J or Holmes had given a correct version of the attitude of Government and stated that he had the assurance of SovemmBfvt that in the event of the non-success of the A.r # O.C application they would be prepared to withdraw opposition to the candidature of his syndicate. He also showed me Hamad 1 s reply,in which the latter stated that he would not give any concession to the ibdi^st because it w 3 common knowledge that Government had large share interests in the Company which contained ex-Crovernment Officials &amp; that although he had great faith in the fairness of Grovernment he would v/ish to feel certain that they would always be unbiased &amp; neutral arbxitrators to protect his interests vis-a-vis any English Company exploiting Oil. As soon as i had a favourable opportunity,I mentioned casually to Heimd that i had seen his reply to Major ^olmes^&amp; thought it wrs unnecessary for him to have given his views on the A.PfO.C. to The Agency Bahrain.rersian Quit 17/3/24 Si fj , ( L ' ' iUSHIRf nSIDENCT. &gt;1 y f ^ r MlftOMli*. ««««!* ^ y ^&lt;0 -)yh ''' '• f JSh / Sha Political Agent SaharM'ri, She Hon'ble the political Hesiaent in the fersisn tfulf.

Sheik Hamad replied to this that I had assured him that (xovernment had no intention of forcing him to give a concession to the -a.P.O.C. or any other company / against his wish,^ that he could not under any circumstances agree to the A.PpOpC. having a concession.He had taken up the Hulership in spite of opposition of all his family &amp; others because he saw that government would have no ( recourse but to take the rule out of the hands of Al Khalifeh,as Colonel JCnox told him f &amp; he thought he could best serve his family by accepting the position;but as regards oil concessions, people had put it about that Shaik Ji )asa T s removal was not unconnected with his ; having given a concession elsewhere than to the A-P49»&lt;3. which all arabs regard as Grovernment pure &amp; simple,^ that if after that / he (Haiaad) consented to the iUPfO.G having the oil^he would be accused by the whole fnmily^as well as other arab Hulers^ of having sold his country in return for being m^de shuik. Wm I at once laughed at his viQW3 / &amp; endeavoured to persuade him that he was Isksc^Kmoai unnecessarily timorous of local opinion,but he was most insistent that he was right^ &amp; that he could under no circumstances alter them. I think that it is not at all jkioprobable that persons opposed to his rule, looking for any stick with which to beat him Govsrnment, hav« thoroughly frightandd him. Not long f=go Xtasuf Zanoo fesrk rem rked to me that ^.osaibi would not have been deported from ^Bahrain if Bin Saud had given the concession to the A.-fc^OoC. so that it is not impossible that similar remarks about Shaikh iuasa^s removal come from the same source. Incidentally you will not have failed to notice the references to oil,the pearl fisheries etc in the petition I recently presented by Abdul Wahab ^aiyani on Bhaik j!iasa*s behalf,to 1 the Viceroy. Abdul Wahab is perfectly fanatical as regards Foreign j influence of any kind in Bahrain &amp; seems always to have been con vinced that £reat Britain intends by degrees to swallow up the resource of the Islands. He will doubtless have made the most of his opportunil -ity to spread about that recent Politics are not unconnected with j oil concessions. Whatever the cause there is no doubt that Hamad has j quite ma.de up his mind to refuse to deal at all with the -^.P^O.C.I have reason to believe that apart from the local sitaation,other Rulers-Bin daud certainly- &amp; probably JCuwait^ have been doing their best to influence him in the matter.

So far as the Board are aware, the Eastern and General Syndicate have not previously undertaken the operation of oil concessions and their only association with an oil undertaking which has come to the knowledge of this Department is that Mr.Edmnd Davis, a prominent member of the Syndicate, was a director of Nyassa Petroleum Syndicate, which was under the management of the D'Arcy Exploration Company and which has now been dissolved. 3. Representatives of the Eastern and General ■Syndicate recently sought advice from this Department as to the selection of geologists who would be competent to undertake the examination of the area covered by the Nejd concession, but it does not appear that they have yet made any appointments.

Shaikh wrote to me March 31st ahout joint oil concession for neutral Zone and I replied as directed. Major Holmes had previously asked ifie for a definition of the Neutral Zone and substituted it for the original one in draft agreement which was certainly far from clear. I 'believe Shaikh signed concession April 5th or at any rate has definitely promised to do so. Apparently Shaikh consulted nobody and the whole affair has been manoevoured through YATIM and MULLAH SALIH. Holmes has presented motor launch to Shaikh. Public opinion is not much in favour of the grant of concession of this sort to any company as it will result in an influx of foreigners and certain difficulties are bound to occur which Ahmed will be incompetent to deal with and mismanagement of which (?) endanger the independence of Kuwait. Holmes will, I think, be leaving the Gulf now, but one geologist or prospector named POPHAM has arrived here and another named HEIM (described as Swiss) is due in about fortnight. These two hope to leave for the South before the end of April and I should be grateful for instructions on the subject in the event of a break with Bin Saud. More. Telegram R. From Hesident, Bushire.

It will be recalled that during the recent visit of machines of Squadron to Bahrein, a forced landing was made near Koweit where the avaitors were rendered every assistance by His Highness who has endeared himself to every flying man. His Highness expressed his sympathy with the E.A.E. in the loss of the two officers recently in the Shammar and is interesting himself in active enquiries among the tribes for news of their movements. The rumour that the bodies of the unfortunate airmen have been Sound has been officially contradicted and the only hope now is that they may have been picked up by wandering tribes and carried off into the interior.

I should however, like to make it clear that my Company would not desire to delay immediate negotiations should you be of the o-oinion that to do so would involve any risk of the Concession beine: finally granted to us. . . 1 understood from you that there is no one else in the ^ield in connection with a possible Oil Concession in the ^ultan T s territory, and I suggest that if negotiations were opened at this moment for no other reason than to bring about cne early return of the Sultan of Mascat from his pleasurable enjoyment in India, this fact might re-act against the Company's interests. .

Msit to Muscat materialisjaag. I feel therefore that I must acquaint you fully with the situation and my ideas on it. 3. In 1921 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company seem- -ed very anxious to secure exclusive oil prospecting rights in Oman and the Home Government pressed us to extract from His Highness a promise that he would not enter into negotiations with any company or group without our permission,This promise was obtained from him nearly two years ago and now it appears that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are not over anxious to start negotiations for the concession.! think this is hardly fair on His Highness.Since first the subject was mentioned to him he has 'been very keen to get the oil developed,no douht with an eye on the material ad- -vantages which have accrued to the Shaikh of Moham- -aerah^and having thus tickled his palate I think it The Hon^le Lieut-Colonel P.B.PrideauXjC.S.IjC.I.B., 2 This is one of the major subjects I had To Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I K Eis up to us to press the Goiapany to open negotiations with a view to development as early as possible. Indeed the Company in April last wrote that they in- -tended if possible to place M a definite and final proposition 'before His Highness in Octo'ber M hut so far no news of this proposition has reached me, 4. My reference to using the oil 'business as a lever to press His Highness to return to Muscat was entirely domestic as he invariahlj tries to put off the evil day as long as possible and the mention of the word oil might stop his dallying on this occa- -sion,There is no question therefore of the Sultan 'being hurried into the grant of a concession - he is extremely anxious to get to 'business, 5. I do not know if 'before applying for ex~ -ploration and prospecting licenses the Company wish -fee to inspect the region in which oil is said to exist or interview any of the local inhabitants of that re« ~gion 'but if they do ample notice will have to 'be given to His Highness f s Government to make the ne - -cessary arrangements. So far as I am aware the oil seepages which have 'been from time to reported are all in the Masireh area « a region most difficult of access &amp; inhabited by a fanatical and suspicious people nominally under His Highnesses suzerainty but actually practically independent who up till now have ■ always resented any attempt ty outsiders to enter fcfratr their country. Shaikh Mansur claims control over them 'but it is auestioahle how far he can make good this claim; any way itUs certain that there is nohody else through whom it would 'be possible to deal. The oil seepages have 'been reported at various times as 'being near the coast 'behind Has lia^kai and inland from the coast opposite the island of Haniar al Nafar 'but in the last talk I had on the subject with His Highness he said that he 'believed the main show to 'be South West of the wadi Kalhuhwhich runs Troifl near Nizwah B.t th© foot of the Jslbel Akhdar to Mahot on the Gulf of Masireh, Questioned as to how far inland this show was he 'became vague and said it had 'been reported to him 'by camelmen travell« -ing down that track as 'being on their right hand 'but he did not think it was very far from the sea, I may say here that my attempt to obtain samples has not come to anything probably owing to the disturbed state of Sur the Wali was unable to get a messenger to visit the region, 7. As I have reported^the present condition of Sur is far from satisfactory and as presumably His Highness will have to reassert his authority there shortly such m action as he takes will of necessity be governed largely by whether he is compelled to take into consideration possible oil developments, as if Jaalan is definitely hostile all oil negotiations with the Shaikhs of Jaalan and Shaikh Mansur who is hand in glove with them will fall to the ground. Hence the necessity for extracting from the Company their intentions as regards oil in these parts as if no action is contemplated x His Highness need not then coni_ ^sider the possible disadvantages of antagonising Jaalan, In any case negotiations with the local Shaikh* are bound to be very protracted and much time must elapse between the grant of licenses and actual ex- -ploration and prospecting, ^ 8 e This brings me to ray last point,The con~ edition of the Muscat State finances demands that all possible sources of revenue be explored at an early date and if the Anglo-Persian Oil Company are not pre pared definitely to make an effort to develop such mineral resources as Muscat is believed to possess then we can hardly in justice to Muscat pursue our policy of what amounts practically to reservation of this field for them and His Highness will be withinIW within his rights in demanding that the enterprise of other Companies 'be sought to achieve Muscat's financial salvation.Telegram P.

If instructions are given at this moment to prevent Major Holmes from carrying out work on the two Artesian Wells, this action will I fear prove a very strong weapon in his hands and will further influence the Sheikh against entering into a concession with the Company. Major Holmes will not hesitate to inform the Sheikh that His Majesty's Government will not permit him to drill for oil or even to negotiate for a concession hexore Aoril next and we can only anticipate that the Sheikh, in view of this attitude, will at least prevaricate, if he does not actually refuse to open negotiations with the Company.

I have duly made the correction in your telegram 1192 of the 21st ultimo. I am much obliged to you for the copies of telegrams exchanged between yourself, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, London, and the High Commissioner, Baghdad. In spite of Major Holmes 1 assurance, I am convinced that he would not have undertaken to contract with the Sheilch of Bahrain to sink the two Artesian Wells for water if he had not had ^an Oil Con cession as an ulterior motive. I suggest that if Major Holmes is allowed to carry out his contract with the Sheikh, of Bahrain, he wall not fail to make use of the opportunity to conduct propaganda calculated to cause the Sheikh of Bahrain to refuse to negotiate with this Company. I feel, therefore, that Major Holmes, subject to your concurrence, should he asked to suspend operations in connection with the Artesian Wells, at any rate until after the 31st of March. You will recollect that the Sheikh of Bahrain has already refused to allow the Company to make even a surface examination of the oil potentialities of the islands, and even although Major Holmes adheres strictly to the terms of his telegram despatched to you 'by the High Commissioner on the Becemher, the fact that he was ■permitted to drill two Artesian Wells would undoubtedly provide him with valuable geological information. I trust that it may be possible for you to take steps to prevent Major Holmes from commencing operations as indicated above in such a manner as will not afford him an opportunity of making capital with the Sheikh of Bahrain which will induce the latter to delay negotia tions for an Oil Concession with the Company. I am despatching Mackie in the course of the next fewS 47 ....29 Dated Z..-.X.r...l.9.Z5 ( 2 ) (aoru ?imnD) days to Zoweit, and as soon as he lias completed work there I propose sending him down to Bahrain. I feel sure that you appreciate the difficulties of our position in opening negotia tions with either Koweit or Bahrain at this moment, and any instructions which you can give to either More or Daly to assist Hackle will 'be very greatly appreciated.

XXX xxxxxxxx Items II &amp; III. (Water scheme &amp; electric power) Ever since I have b^a here the iuaicipal Council nave pressed me to help to make arrangements to get some reliable company interest ed in this matter.I have eadeavoureel to do so with indifferent success• Several companies have discussed the matter but seem dis inclined to really take it up,&lt;§c either have not the experts or -re disinclined to send them to Bahraia to go into the question of water supply. Recently I took advantage of the visit of kujor Holmes who as you kaow # has concluded business arrangements with the Sultan of Hajd,to take his opinion.He is fairly certain that water could be got by sinking artesian wells almost anywhere on the island,but it would be necessary to make tests first.I asked if •• ny of th^ com panies he represents would be v/illing to make the tests at their own expense with a view^if sucessful f to starting a company for ■supply of electric power &amp; drinking water for Maaameh.After a good deal of persuasion Tie agreed to put the natter lavoufably before the trust syndicate which he represents &amp; thought tb t he could probably induce them to send out an extra engineer,if they were going on with their schemes on the mainland.This appears now to be the caseit wo Id seem aa unique opportunity to get thi natter ; seriously gone into with prospects of good results. S? put the matter before the Muaicipal meeting the members of which were'unanimously in favour of Ir Holmes being asked to endeavour to get the scheme taken up. I pointed out,however,that I should be disinclined to ask him to suggest to ny company that they should send an expert &amp; go to the expense of experimenting unless we could assure him tin t if aftesian wells be found to be practicabi3. m /ifj^ i ^ \ )| t cticable &amp; th« company put up rtaso^ablt proposals for the supply ss^jaS) i£^^n3!f. 4 ss%^^g!^ Udi... t^y-^uu ottJ. ««3E , ^.fJS^n,'®?J^S!5 - * 1W arrw.g.mwts, as I did not rtcoMm.md Him to do so u*tif w« hld a efi*it« assuraacs th*t thtre would ^ ao further diffioultils. , 0 Av , membars of tht couMcil, top fetlier v^ith Shaiks BKi^d to U al^w a t 1 ^ d 0 f Sh ^ k Is - &amp; the matter .Th® latSr to scneini to procted on any coaditlom,while r«- ufeiKg to give aay rtasoas «xcspt that th«y had ma4»g«d alright im th» J X X x x X s a co«stqu.«ct of Shaik Isa's r.fusal th# natter lapssd for a time, 1 though it frequently cam® up at Municipal M@ &amp; tiMgs. I m June 1923 Shaik Isa was removed from power &amp; ths direct Dutrol of affairs placed in the hands of Shaik Hamad, it of the first proposals the latter made was that the water &amp; idbadri Lectrical schemes should be pushed on for two reasons- (I) That he id always heen strongly in favour of them (2) That he was keenly de- Lrous of carrying out early some schemes of public benifit which fuld n&amp;k® obvious to all the improved state of affairs &amp; tend to Btigate the unpopularity which he had incurred among some sections : || nis subjects by taking over affairs on the supersession of his ither. It v /as however,not possible to proceed immediately owing to jck of funds,as Shaik Hamad desired to put the scheme through as a atu work &amp; not to sell the water. In due course funds became avail- ■ the 'le.

With best compliments your friend. (sealed) Hamad bin Isa. )Copy Cf letter No. 176/9/9. dated 31/7/24 from the Political Agent,Bahrain to Majcr Frank Holmes, The Eastern &amp; General Syndicate St. Swithins Lane .LONDON. Dear Sir, I write at tbe: request of the Deputy Ruler of Bahrain, Steiik Hamad bin Isa A1 Khalifeh. Fir?fely,His Excellency fio. Shaik desires me to state,that he has received the report,dravn up by Dr Helm,regarding the possibility &lt;Sf boing for water on ^ the Baarain Islands. Secondly,as you are personally aware,the object of obtaining this report was to have an expert opinion on the possibility of introducing a water supply ,by means of artesian wells,for the towns of Muharrek &amp; Manameh. It would appear from the report that Dr Helm is of opinion that no great difficulty should be experienced in carrying out such* project. Shaik Hamad has asked me to communicate with you with a view to making definite arrangements for the work to proceed. He is anxious to know,whether one of the companies with which you are associated will undertake the boring of artesian wells &amp; the necessary work in connection with a water supply for the two towns mentioned. It was Shaik Hamads intention to go into this matter per— -sonally when in London,but circumstances have arisen which mafe^ it imposiible for him to visit England this year,&amp; he is anxious that there should be no delay in starting the scheme which he wishes carried out during the; next cold season. Dr Helm lays soi*^ stress on the advis4bi]ity of the work being carried out under the supervision of an expert geologist.The Shaik considers this of importance &amp; v^auld requel^' that in connection with any proposals you would put forth,you should indicate who would be the geologist under whose supervise -ion the work would proceed,&amp; describe his qualification far* work,particularly his past experience in boring for water. Itis evident tnat the actual boring will not present much difficuCt' 'but it would seem absolutely eFSenti^l that the geologist &amp; engineer in charge should be persons experienced in the particui' -ar branch of work. The sum of money which the G-Sverhment of Bahrain isi prepared to expend on the project is strictly limited,&amp; the Grovernment is not prepared to com it itself to heaay expentidure except ori actual results,but is prepared to guarantee a reasonab^ sum to cover the expenditure involved in sinking,say,the first two experimental wells. Thereafter an agreement is desi^^i k I hk payment whereby pxy*nt would be consequent on actual results i.e. successful wells sunk.As time is of great importance,it being desried that work in Bahrain should start not later than the midle of November^ if possible earlier,the Shaik requests that * you will desire the company wishing to take up this work to pu^/up a definite scheme as early as posrible &lt;&amp; as complete as Possible,to avoid the necessity f&lt;rr correspondance ,so that it can be accepted,if agreed to,by telegram &amp; no undue delay re sult. The scheme must be such that th£ financial commitments of the Bahrain G-overnment are clearly stated from the outset,it being quite impossible for the Government to accept any scheme under which the expenditure would be indefinitely defined.lt is a- hQped that your personal knowledge of Shrain &amp; the requirements A of the tcrwns in question,will enable you to draw up a definite . proposal at a very early date.Should it be absolutely necessary, to avoid delay,kindly communicate by telegraph,thoush it is hoped this will not be necessary, I am Sir, Yours faithfully (sd)C.K.Daly Major.

Further the,the services of the well known ■ geoligist Mr P.Q Madgwick have been secured to undertake the supervison of the work,both from the practical &amp; technical Sides. I enclose a resume of Mr Madgwicks professional career, &amp; you will secfrom it that he has a large experience in locating &amp; drilling artesian wells* Refering to your letter of July 27th 19S4 (876/9/?^ our reprepentative in Ihrain,Major F^ank Holmes ,is fully a** aware of the importance of these two preliminary bores,has gone into the qiestion with experts in this work, &amp; he feels confident that the work is being placed into most capable hands. The plant,(if our terms are accepted) that will be sent out to Bahrain is a new one of the latest Calyx Rotary type, &amp; will yield a core of 5 M Diameter,casing is being supplied sufficient to line the holes the first two hundred feet of each from the surface. The experts suggest that 100 feet of lining in each hole would be sufficient,but in order to be perfectly safe from pollution of the artesian water an extra hundred fe^t for each hole is being supplied. The plant will be sent out well supplied with tools &amp; spare parts,&amp; should complete the two holes in from four to five months from date of arrival on the wel^site. The terms upon[.vhich this Syndicate ip prepared to sink the two experimantal holes to a maximum depth of ^00 feet or until water be struck in sufficient quantities at any lesser depth than the 000 ft mentioned/above isrupees 100,000. Tiiie to be tke total expenditure to be incurred 'by the Bahrain Government in respect of the two experimental holes* The payment of the rupees 100,000. to be made as follows. Fifty thousand rupees to be placed to the credit of the Eastern &amp; Q-eneral Syndicate Ltd. with the Eastern Bank Ltd.BstM Bahrain,forthwith upon accepting this tender,the balance of rupees 50,000 to be paid upon the completion of the two experimental holes. The water from the wells will be placed under proper control (in the case of the artesian water overflowing) by means of crowns &amp; valves, before being handed over to the Municipality. In the case of either the Bahrain Government or private individuals in Bahrain requiring additional holes to be drilled,over &amp; above the two experimantal holes mentioned above these addtiiional holes shall be the subject of separate agreement It is understood that the Bahrain Government in no way incur any liability in respect of any holes beyond the first two experimental holes.

The boring is to be to a depth of 600 feet, or less if water is found quicker. One geologist named Madgwick and two drillers with plant have arrived here.

I My dear Oolonel Prideaux, V/ith reference to my letter Ho. 29 of tlie 2nd of January, Maokie, who has been visiting 'both ICoweit and Bahrain, has addressed me from the latter place informing me that shortly 'before Sheikh Isa was deposed in favour of his son, Sheikh Hamad, he had 'ranted the Bahrain Concession to Llajor Holmes. Mackie informs me that this information was given him by Daly and, surprising though it is in view of the promises made by the Colonial Office to this Company, I have no option other than to regard it as correct. Daly has expressed the opinion to Mackie that he believes Sheikh Hamad would as soon give the Concession to us as to any one else, but in view of the act of his father he is particularly anxious not to go back on any undertaking entered into by Sheikh Isa, at any rate whilst the old man is alive. I can only believe that this Concession was granted secretly by Sheikh Isa, as I can trace nothing on my files to the effect that we have ever received notice of Sheikh Isa^ act. Would the fact that the agreement was entered into with out the knowledge or consent of the British G-overniiient oe sufficient to invalidate it ? It seems to me that Sheikh Hamad T s attitude towards this Company in the past has been entirely due to the knowledge that his father had already granted -a concession to ilajor Holmes and that our chances of carrying through negotiations successfully are oound to oe abortive unless the British G-overnment can at this^moment definitely inform Sheikh Hamad that the agreement is^ invalid and may, in conseauence, be entirely disregarded by him. I shall be grateful if you can let me have your considered opinion on this matter at an early date as our future action must of necessity depend upon your decision.m ( 2 ) ( ooittihtjed) With reference to Major Holmes* agreement to drill two Artesian Wells at Bahrain .under an arrangement entered into with the Sheikh, Mackie has informed me that the material and staff for these wells have already arrived at Bahrain and that he feels that if the work is not allowed to proceed imtil after the Jlst of March considerable expense would 'be involved, which Major Holmes may expect the Sheikh of Bahrain to meet, and the fact that work is delayed would be entirely laid at our door. I therefore considered it advisable to ask Lincoln to convey to you the following telegram;- 'With reference to my letter 29 of 2nd January in view 'of advices from Mackie at Bahrain have decided with 'your concurrence withdraw our objections to Holmes 'sinking Artesian Wells'. I think you will agree with me that I had no option. in view of the position at Bahrain as detailed earlier in this letter, other than to ask you to kindly withdraw your objections to the above work being proceeded with.

Pricleaux On further oaneidaration I feel that my letter N0.III7 of JOth January may be open to misoonstruotlon when I say that I can traoe nothing on my files to the effect that we have ever received notice of Shaikh Isa's having given the Bahrain Concession to Holmes, lue did as a matter of fact receive information from Mao tie to that effect in May 1925 and we under stood that the agreement was subject to ratification by the Home Gove run ant and to cancellation if it was not ratified within six months. I had therefore assumed that, the agreement not having yet been ratified and the period of six months having long ago expired, Shaikh Isa's action had became invalid. From what Mackie tells me however on his return from Bahrain it appears that Sheikh Hamad does not regard it in this light but still feels himself bound by his father's action, and that this is the main factor leading to his refusal to discuss aur terns with us. I# IU W 1159 Dated...J..:A.^31 2 I should therefore be glad to know what your views are regarding the present validity of the action taken by Shaikh Isa in 1923• I would venture to draw your attention to the fact that though we obtained this information through Mackie almost two years ago we have never received from you or your predecessor any confirmation of it. This fact alone had caused us to regard the concession as nul and void and we were therefore all the more surprised to learn from Mr. Mackie that Major Daly regards Shaikh Hamad's attitude at this moment as / atleast, tenable.

We appreciatethe ostensible reasons for Major Holmes 1 visit to Bahrain, but we can hardly believe that the assistance of two geologists would be required for the drilling of two artesian wells to a maximum depth of 600 feet. 3. In accordance with the intentions expressed in your letters Nos .39119/1923 of the 21st September 1923, and 58360/23 of 19th December 1923, we understood that negotiations on the lines of agreements accepted by us were to be undertaken by H.M.Resident at Bushire. We have therefore abstained from direct negotiations with the Shaikhs concerned, with the result, it would appear, of further prejudicing our position in the fac-e of the direct negotiations, assisted ^e understand by suitable gifts, of the Eastern and General Syndicate. 4. The invitation which we extended to the Shaikh of Bahrain, through the Political Agent, for a visit to our Persian oil fields has bsen declined by the ShaikhShaikh at least for two monthB, in view of the present incidence of the hawking season. 5* As regarfs the suggestion by our General Manager in Mohaiumerah, that at this juncture any direct interference with the water boring contracts of the Eastern and Greneral Syndicate would only react unfavourably on our own interests, we hesitate to express an opinion, in view of that apparently held by our Representative on the spot . 6. We are sending to Bahrain a representative to counteract, if it be possible at this stage, the adverse influence on the Shaikh of Major Holmes' activities. It appears clear to us that no definitive results are likely to be attained by March 31st, for further procrastination by the Shaikh will leave him and his advisers the more freebo test the generosity of the Eastern and General Syndicate.

T ill have indicated to you that I was under a misapprehension when writing you on the JOth ultimo. I now find that ay london office forwarded me an extract from Colonial Office letter l r o. 27441/23 of the 22na of June, 1923, to them. It is satisfactory to learn that you are of the opinion t\at v 'e need not regard Sheikh Hamad 's reluctance to open negotiations with the Company too seriously, and I can only hope that he may he induced to pay us his promised visit very early in March; failing the opportunit: of this visit I do not see how we can hope to conclude negotiations with him 'before the 'Jlst of March. Mackie has now returned from his visit to Bali rain and in his last interview with SheiMi Hamad on the 23rd of January he states that the latter discussed the question of a conces sion with him much more openly than he had done hitherto. Sheikh Hamad's attitude to Mackie nas that, although his father had civen Eolmes a promise of a concession shortly 'before his deposition, he would personally prefer the Company to ^et the concession] hut that he did not feel himself to he in a posi tion at the moment to go hack on 'Lis father's act.. Sheikh Hamad admitted that he was much struck with Holmes' inactivity in connection with the Eassa Concession; this in spite of the promise he had given to Ihn Saud in the summer that he and his( 2 ) Dated 14.-..2..-.1925., men would come /back ana continue their work as soon as the cold weatner began. Maokie endeavoured to extract a promise from Sheikh Haiaad that even though he could not actually grant us the concession at tins moment he would nevertheless refuse to ratify his father s promise to give it to Holmes. Sheikh Hamad, how- ever, ^wcuia not definitely commit himself, hut Uackie gathered that ^ m as^ far as he was personally ahle to do so he would consider the Company's proposals in preference to those of Holmes. There appears to he very little hope that we shall te able to get eitner the Bahrain or the Eoweit Concession through before the 31 s ^ 0j - ^arch, and I think you will a^ree that this position is due to no lack of endeavour on our part. The hostil- ity which has been in evidence against the Company only manifested icsel-w a-ter the arrival of Major Holmes on the scene and the lact that he^ has already indicated his willingness in'his draft concession with Bahrain to grant terms which are more favourable to the Sheikh than those provided for in the Colonial Office drafts has in itself rendered it impossible for us to open negotiations with the Sheikh. Under the circumstances - over which, I think you will a~ree, we have had no control - the priority granted to the Oompany by the Colonial Office which expires on the ^Ist of March has been entirely nullified and, in as ..ar as I can see, our only hope of obtaining the concession on^terms which would render it commercially attractive is the failure of. Major Holmes to carry out his obligations in respect of the Eassa Concession. I note that you will tell Daly to continue to press Sheikh Hamad, and you will, I anticipate, have since received Daly T s report on Mackie T s recent visit. In the meantime I fail to see what steps we can take to overcome the deadlock either in respect of Bahrain or Eoweit, but if it would be of any assistance I should be pleased to send Mackie down to Eushire to discuss the position with you. I note that Crosthwaite, who is now Resident at Mascat, is a brother of the political officer who was attached to the Persian Railway Syndicate and who, I understand, has since retired from the Political Service. Mackie T s leave is over-due and he will be proceeding liome in April, which constitutes a further reason for my keen anxiety to bring matters to a head at the earliest possible moment.he Residency, Bushire/ 18th February i92b dcss*. I have to acknowledge the receipt of your two letters, Hoc.

I am not sure that I agree with him. On the oUier hand, 1 rather think that when rhaikh Hamad sees the wonderful organization and magnitude of your lialdan-l-Haftun settlement he will more and more feel that it infki u. must be a Government concern am that if a eimllar.ie intro- -duced into Bahrain his own authority and prestige will be proportionately diminished. 1 hear from More that 'Kaji Abdullah' heard in Kuwait that the Shaikh had been advised to suspend all ne^ot- •l&amp;tions until March n# Don*t you think that this may be due to Holmes letting the haikhs know thac he was geoting his liberty to negotiate from the 1st April ? I wonder if the Eastern and General^Syndicate's inactivity on the mainland has not been simply due to doubts as to the outcome of Bin Spud's enterprise towards the west, and the possibility of his getting to loggerheads with His majesty's Government.

I think that you should go ahead strongly at Muscat, and advise you to send Dickie there without further delay. .he only obstacle down there, I believe, is ihe Question of protecting your establisliments if the local Shaikhs are hostile and regardless of the Tultan's commands.

Prideaux, I thank you for your B/o letter No.42-3 dated February 19th # I note that Daly considsrs that it was a mistake for Mackie both to press Shaikh Hamad to visit the Oil Fields and to * discuss with him the draft Concession. I am glad to see that you do not agree with Daly's view. Daly I understand expressed no such views when Mackie was in Bahrein and certainly gave Ma, ckie the idea that he regarded his action as the right one and the results reached as satisfactory# I do not share your apprehensions regarding the effect on the Shaikh of a visit to the Oil Fields, It is our experience that no Arah can conceive of the expense and amount of the work involved in the development of an Oil Field. They regard an oil well as a mere shallow hole not unlike their own water wells which can be dug for a few pounds, and have no idea of the enormous amount of machinery, pipe and other material required( - 2 . ) nor of 'th-Q 3»inouii't of iQ-biDtufc 'to be employGd, TI10 effect on 'tiie Sheikh 01 Kuwait has, we consider, heen excellent and have no reason to suppose that the effect on the Sheikh of Bahrein will oe any less satisfactory, When we show him how completel; we avoid interference in this work of Government both here and in ields and ^badan we shall, I think, be able to allay any fears he may have on that score* I feel that what is required now in Bahrein is that you should instruct Daly to inform the Sheikh that he need not feel himself in any way bound by his father T s grant of the Concession to Holmes, as His IIaJesty T s Government has definitely stated that it will not approve of the Concession in the terms of the draft presented by him to -Sheikh I^sa. as it considers some of the Glauses contained therein are objec tionable, Even if then the Shel h does eventually decide to give the Concession to Holmes he will have to do so by an agreement drawn up in a fom different to that which Holmes has already presented and which will have to be approved in the first place by His Majesty 1 s Government. It is obvious from what Sheikh Eamad told . ackie that this has not yet been made clear to him by the representatives of His .'ajesty 1 s Government in the Persian Gulf and that this omission on their ill1 f i* ( - 3 - ) part is proving a very serious obstacle to us in our efforts to open negotiations with the Sheikh. 'Eo less harm I suggest has been done to our interests 'by the action of Grovemment in informing the Eastern and General Syndicate that the period during which we are re - garded by the Home Government as having preferential rights ends on March 31 s 't* Holmes has naturally see^to it that this information has reached the SheiMis and people of Bahrein and Kuwait and, that being the case ^.t is but natural that the Sheikhs are being pressed to suspend negotiations until after that date and are refusing to discuss our draft or formulate objections to it until they are in a position to receive offers from others and make comparisons. Your suggestion that we might squeeze the Eastern and General Syndicate out of Bahrein by simply offering the * Sheikh a subsidy to reject all offers for a Concession to all except ourselves appears to me to be scarcely feasible as it would not alleviate the cupidity of the Sheikh in any subse quent negotiations and would as you suggest involve the pay ment of a very considerable sum per annum for every year we delay in coming to final conclusions, th © With/ prosperous state of Bahrein 1 s finances and the large income which I understand is enjdyed by the Sheikh any subsidy would have to be very substantial and therefore wouldIO (-4.) 0 .t 1.0 ! tUlli la of ^ ^ ^ prospects of the Islands ar e at best a eambl e.

As regards Muscat, feeling that our negotiations at Kuwait and Bahrein were of more immediate urgency I had for the moment dropped the idea of sending anyone to open negotia tions with the Sultan but in view of your discussions with him it seems to me that there is a risk that if we dtf not make a move at once, he may begin to look around for other offers with the result that when we do make our offer we may find someone else well dug in as was the case at Easa and appears to be equally the case at Bahrein. I am therefore contemplating sending Mackie there at once to present him *ith our draft and give him time to consider it and formulate his objections at his leisure, the completion of the negotiations being de-( - 5 - ) delayed tmtil after the Kot weather. I should be glad to have yotir views on this. Yours sincerely. Lieut• Ool. F.B.Prideaux, O.S.I.,0.I.E., Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRB.

Jacks, has met both chiefs at - uharornarah this summer. here is unfortunately a noticeable distrust of the Anglo- ersian Oil Company in both Chiefships# his is due to the beliefs (l) that the Company is a Iritish Government concern anci likely therefore to interfere more boldly than a private company would in the internal affairs of the Btates^ (2) that it does not really wish to bore for oil at all at present but only to keep its rivals out of the Gulf, and (5) that, when it does commence operations, being such a large corporation, it will attract many ot the divers from the earling Xndustry ane wxll al^o increase enormously the un welcome influx of foreigners- 4. part from this distrust, I feel sure that ajor Folines or his Agents have let t»he ^ haiichs knov* thau hi^i Syndicate rincipal Secretary of 'tate lor the colonies.

( OOKFIDBMIAI) My dear Col. Prideaux, VlQien the terms of the draft Ooncession to be offered to the Shaikh of Kuwait were under discussion in 1922 we tried hard to have included a clause granting us permanent exemption from the payment of Customs duties 'both on our machinery and on the reasonable personal requirements of our Staff♦ Objections were however raised to this by the Colonial Office who in their letter dated August 14th definitely refused to recommend to the Shaikh that he should accept such a Clause but agreed to recommend to him that we should be given freedom from the payment of Customs for a period of ten years. As long as the Colonial Office maintained that attitude we were unable to do anything but accept the position and agree to the inclusion of the 10 year immunity in our draft. We have however continued to press the Colonial Office to reconsider its decision and we are now informed that they have verbally agreed to waive their objections and to re~ commend to the Shaikh the grant of permanent immunity.$■1 ( - 2 . ) 6.3.1925. r Meanwhile however in the drafts which we have actually presented to the Shaikhs we have included the ten year limitation. Owing to the refusal of the Shaikhs to discuss the drafts with us or to formulate any objections they may have to them we d.o not know whether they have paid any actual attention to them or have even read them so as to 'be aware of their contents. We should be glad to have your views therefore regarding the possibility of our getting back the drafts now in their possession and substituting revised ones, or of our being able to secure permanent immunity during the negotiations which must take place before any agreement can actually be reached with the Shaikhs, It may be that our best chance of obtaining our ends will be to make no mention of the matter until they themselves bring it up* If on the other hand,Holmes has, as we believe offered to pay ifo export duty on all oil exported, it may be that any attempt to withdraw from the terms of the draft already pre sented to the Shaikhs may seriously militate against our chances of success. Would it be possible for you to obtain a copy of the Agreement entered into between Shaikh Issa of Bahrein and Holmes also a copy of any draft Agreement which he may have1 2 6 1 { - 3 - ) Dated 19.25* submitted to the Sheikh of Kuwait, I should 'be most grateful if you could assist me in this matter.

Prideaux, I enclose a copy of a letter whioh I have sent to Daly regarding Madgwick, the man who is, on Holmes 1 behalf, superintending the sinking of the artesian wells in Bahrein. In my letter No. 29 of January 2nd I expressed the opinion that Holmes would not have undertaken to contract to sink two artesian wells for water if he had not had an Oil Concession as an ulterior motive; and I also expressed my anxiety regarding the valuable geological information which the work would give him. The information which I have received from Sir John Cadman regarding Madgwick's qualifica tions appears to afford proof positive that my suspicions were well founded and that Holmes is determined by hook or by crook to obtain the information he requires regarding the probability of there being oil in Bahrein. That a contract for these water wells was ever permitted to be placed with the Eastern and General Syndicate whose oneS S 46 .2.5..3.. Dated....7..•.5. •i9.^5 • object throughout has been the Oil Goncession was, I venture to suggest, directly opposed to our interests and contrary to the spirit of the priority negotiations which the Golonial Office recognised we were entitled to solely in view of the fact that at a time when we could have obtained the Concessions for Bahrein and Kuwait we delayed negotiations to meet the wishes of the Govern ment. In view of the position of the Eastern and General Syndicate I certainly feel that if enquiries had been made regarding Madgwici: 1 s qualifications there would have been no room for dubiety as to his real motives. 1 trust that you will, if opportunity offers impress on the -Sheikh of Bahrein that ability to drill a well to a maximum depth of 500 feet when part at any rate of the cost of doing so is paid to him in advance is no proof of Holmes ability to drill deep wells for oil and himself provide the funds required for the work.

Bushire March Ilth 1925 Jfy dear Jacks, I have seen your letter No i263 to Colonel Prideaux* - In regard to Madgwick I gave MacKie all the infor mation which we had received from the company about his qualifica tions-which was to the effect that he was an artesian well expert &amp; had sunk a number of such wells for the War Office at Salonika. I also said that I had watched him since his arrival in Bahrain &amp; had learnt nothing which led me to suppose that he associated with the oil activities of Holmes,Mackie was of the opinion that it would be detrimental to your interests to oppose the sinking of the wells as it would afford an opportunity to your rivals to antagon ist the shaikh I agreed with this view^fc Mackie told me that he had wired to you* You will doubtless recollect that before this, you had yourself written to Colonel Prideaux expressing the same opinion i»e» that it might be a bad thing to oppose the work. I have also seen your 1212 of Feby. 21st in which you say that I did not advise Mackie that I thought it xk in^oppottnEe to present a draft concession in view of the decision we had taken, to do all we could to induce the ^jsjhik to visit Muhammerah. I did not advise Mackie because he never consulted me^ or at any time mentioned that he intended to presenter had presented,a draft concession^ I only learnt it after he had left Bahrain, from Shaik Hamad who told me that Mackie had given him some ♦conditions*^ which I imagine to be a draft concession.

We have now received telegraphic informa tion from our General Manager at Mohammerah of the arrival Bahrain (after a fruitless visit to Kuwait) of our representative. 3. The Shaikh of Bahrain has informed our representative of his unwillingness to annul his father's obligations, but he has promised that he will not ratify his father's concession to the Eastern and General Syndicate if he can avoid this course. It will be recollected that this concession was obtained from the late Shaikh of Bahrain in his dotage, and was one of his last acts before abdicating in favour of the present Shaikh. ,on the lines of your letter No.39119/23 of the 21st September / 4. The draft of the agreement,/1923, is being discussed with the Shaikh, but we do not propose to H press him to formulate his objections, if any, until his promised visit to our operations in Persia has been accomplished. In our letter above cited we informed you of the delay to this visit involved by the incidence of the Shaikh's hawking season. 5. tovV c (g) 5.

The Under Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, S.W.I. Sir, We have the honour to refer to developments in connection with the oil Concession from the Shaikh of Kuwait, which has for very many months 'been in course of negotiation by the Political Agent. 2. We recently sent a representative to endeavour to persuade the Shaikh to formulate definitely his objections, if any, to the draft agreement on the lines of which we agreed with you in September 1923. Despite the Shaikh's protestations to our General Manager at Mohammerah, on the Shaikh 1 s return from a visit to our operations last autumn, that he wished to grant a concession to no other person or Company than ourselves, it has proved impossible for the Political Agent to make any advance in his negotiations. We regret to say that our representative reports a similar experience: the Shaikh continues to procrastinate and to urge that he must a?/ait the return oi certain notables who are still absent (after many months), before giving any definite reply to our proposals. 3. In view of the prescribed period to which you have limited negotiations by the Political Resident on our sole behalf, we would ask that the Resident may be instructed to lose no opportunity of strongly pressing the Shaikh of Kuwait to make a definite reply to the offers made on our behalf.

Ma 11 am arrived here today and goes to Bahrain next Monday or Tuesday. He works under Daly till the latter goes on six months* leave in May** */ I hope we shall see Mackie about next Monday, on his way to Muscat. Ac Shaikh Hamad leaves for England about the end of April, I don't think it at all likely that he will now find the time to visit the oil-fiftlds. Kor do I think that the Eastern and General Syndic- -ate will make any progress during April, as they know that they have to get the prior approval of the Colonial Office to their draft concesBion. By the way I hear that Holmes is not in Baghdad. Has he gone to England ? Daly says it is much easier to block the Eastern and ikL MOSMSSL General Syndicate's negotiations than to get to come to terms with you. ^e is anyhow doing his best on your behalf. Probably there will be a lull until Shaikh Hamad returns about July next. With regard to the water-boring operations Daly tells me that when he sailed for Bushire, the engineer had not got more than 100 feet down and that he was going througl: a hard rock. T. L.

On the other hand, the Company at Muharmnerah have at different times sent agents to interview the Shaikhs. o these interviews the Political officer* have not been invitea, and statements have been made at these which the Political officers, on hearing about them, have deprecated. 1 have told Mr. Jacks that it is comparatively easy to block the Eastern and General Syndicate's way to success in Bahrain and Kuwait but very difficult at present to get the concessions for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. In Muscat, the Company have recently sent an Agent to see the Sultan after several months* pressure from me. He has achieved some success, as the enclosed telegram, which.

CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS. ..I.5.7.5 Dated 2721: ■ My dear Colonel Prideaux, I have received a telegram from I.ackie at Mascat dated tlie SJrd of March informing me that the Political Agent there has received no instructions from you regarding the attitude he is to adopt towards our negotiations with the Sultan of Has cat. I have received definite instructions from London that the limitation of 10 years from the commencement of the Mining lease, for which period the draft entitles us to freedom from all Taxes and Customs Eouse Duties, is under no consideration to I ds included in the Concession, freedom from all taxes and Cus toms Eouse Duties, it has 'been agreed with the Colonial Office, will 'be for the entire period of any lining Lease ts&amp;en up. Unfortunately, Crosthwaite is unaware of this reconsideration and his predecessor had already, -- ac—ie informs me, apparently^ landed over the original Colonial Office dra t go the .uxtan ox Hascat which, in addition to the Customs Limitation, includes provision for'the payment of a second Hs. 10,000/- following the signature of the Prospecting Licence as per Article 5• ^ ri ^ e ^ . tine Sultan of Uascat can be informed 'by the Political ^gent that the inclusion of 'both these conditions was due to an entire misunderstanding and that the Colonial Office are in lull agree ment with their deletion, it is unlikely that . .aCziie will oe able to make any headway with the Sultan, who he informs me is otherwise showing himself to be only too willing to come to an understanding with us. So far the Sultan has made one stipulation to ■ ej-^ect that a Clause should he inserted explaining: that, although the Concession is ranted for all the territory oyer v .hieh he rules there are nevertheless certain parts of Oman into vr.xca it would te unsafe for our representatives to enter owing uo u ne i^a^.e ouate control which he is able to exercise over those areas.( 2 ) (GOnTIETJSD) There would appear to 'be no otgection o protecting the Sultan suitably in connection with these areas, always provided they are clearly demarcated and set down in any ^ re erne nt finally concluded 'between us, and in this respect I have referred to London. Jackie is strongly of the opinion that provided he receives the.full support of Ida:or Orosthwaite, he is likely to have little difficulty in concluding an agree ont with tne Sultan, and I shall 'be very grateful if you would telegraph to Crosthwaite defining the position to him I am unaware if you have received advice from the^ Colonial Office regarding the deletion of the Customs limita tion but as the lolitical Agent at Ilascat is without any information I assume that you are similarly situated, ana i have therefore, in telegraphing my Principals^ in London as^iea them to approach the Colonial Office wi oh a view to ^..euCx g this matter immediately cleared up.

As I pointed out the draft concession brought by Mackie for Muscat differs in two points from the draft Kdweit concession . One point is as regards the levying of-customs duties. In the case of Koweit the customs We *re t0 b e foregone for 10 years , while in the Muscat case the A. P. 0. C. aslc that they be foregone altogether . Mackie tells me that this has been done in accordance with private intelligence received by the A. P. 0.0. from London that the Col; Secretary has approved of this considerable modification. This of course awaits your confirmation. Personally I think it hard on the Sultan- as regards privately imported stores as spitits, wines,etc. Goods actually for the Company's works might well be admitted free, ( J * The other difference ( so far found by me ) is as regards the limits of the concession. The omission of any specified acreage In the of Muscat is quite justified owing to the natu the country.I suggested to H.

After Mackie took his leave^ yesterday from the interview with H. H I stayed to talk over matters with H. H, and the latter then said that he would tell me where, there really was oil.

There is a stream there flowing from the hills that he says- is him on the Triad to Dhofar and ask Capt Lehr to put in at Kamar Bay and see the place. One great advantage of Kamar Bay is that work coUld start there and at Dhofar generally with absolute safety according to H.

I guite agree that it would probably not be advisable to attempt to withdraw the Draft Agreements already submitted to the Sheikhs at Bahrain and Zoweit. I am pleased to learn that you feel that onoe the general principles have been accep ted by the Sheikhs, you do not consider that they will hold out on account of such modifications as the withdrawal of the 10 year limitation and the second payment of Hs. 10,000/- in Clause 5 of the Prospecting licence Whilst it will be seen that your ^— view is correct in as far as Mascat is concerned, I am not so confident regarding Bahrain and Zoweit, as we of course have — the influence of Major Holmes on behalf of the Eastern General Syndicate to contend with. At Mascat Machie informs me the Sultan would be entirely willing to sign the Agreement submitted to him provided he is recommended to do so by Crosthwaite, and it seems to me of first importance, if our negotiations are to progress at all, that the understanding which has been reached between the Colonial Office and my London Office should be confirmed to you by the former. I am much obliged to you for asking Daly to endeavour to get copies of Eolmes T agreement ■:ith Sheiiih Isa, also copies of any subsequent draft agreements which Holmes may have submit ted.

It is perhaps not appreciated ho little the Sultan of Muscat has to offer to the. Anglo- Persian Oil Company. He can only offer for exploration strip along Batina Coast., which is not supposed to contain j oil, and Gwadur territory. From Muscat southward he has: 'but nominal control of seaport and any exploration is impossible without previous agreement of tribe(s) concerned -- which agreement is problematical. Dhofar offers perhaps a field for safe exploration, but alleged oil appears to lie West of the Sultan^ territory. It is also just possible rival oil concessionaire might approach leading hinterland Shaikhs direct. I therefore suggest as Colonial 01fice clearly object o monopolist aspect of present proposal and insist ^ on 100,000 acree as limit of concessianary area,the Company be allowed to divide this area into as many plots as they may desire. (Jonf igUEst ion of terrain militates against larg. block. Batina Coast is narrow strip betv .een hill and sea. From I us cat southward is mountainous country right back to desert. Bhofar province with sea coast --length 130 miles J. 18 miles in dejjth — is hilly : plain which is 46 miies long and only 10 miles depth at bri. ad. e n t'broadest place.

This now omits P ?£&gt;/*/) tefrn q the second douceur of Rs 10,000 when the license is granted. Mackie says this has 'been omitted from the revised form of agreement put before the Shaikh of Koweit. He tells me today he has heard from Jacks that the Colonial office is cabling to you approving of the changes reported by me. I wonder if this will turn out correct. As regards the merits and demerits of this agreement , I think myself that H. H. the Sultan is lucky to have such good terms offered him as he has precious little to offer in return . He gets Rs 10,000 down on signing the agreement , and all he can offer in the way of territory for prospecting &amp; exploration is the Batina slip of territory ( where there apparently is no oil ). th~ possibility only of prospecting around Sur - and that to only a very limited extent and subject to the possible compliance of Shaikh Mansur and other Jaalan leaders and tribesmen ; andlastly the country round Dhofar - where he says there is oil. I shall counsel Thomas to recoimnend the signing of the agreement as soon as I get your instructions regarding my telegrams. ( H. H. is certainly not in a position to stick out for big terms as he has practically nothing to offer. Thomas' ship is a day late and does not come in till the second April. H. H 1 s horn seems to be unduly exalted with this fuss about the oil concession and he scarcely seems to appreciate what little he has to give^and perhaps the A.P.O. G. on their part scarcely have grasped the situation. That is why I have impressed on H. H . to qualify ' the territories under his contral ' by adding some formula to the effect ' mmmmmmit being understood that certain parts are at present unsafe to enter ,, , He is certainly not in a position to give a concession over Oman, and failing which , if there is no saving clause , the A.P. 0. C. might easily claim that hehasnot carried out his part of the agreement i. e. to ^concession over what is known as Oman. H. H. my stick out for customs on private goods after 10 years-, and I think he would be justified in that upto the extent of not letting the agreement fall to the ground . On Thomas's arrldl I tv ill let him and Mackie have a real good bargaining , and when \^57) mu&lt; • -W +n agreement , have the matter clinched. they have come nigh to ag H.

He is very pleased you have allowed him H, M. S« Triad on the 8th April and is busy jpaclcing , so I hear. (P ^ P. S. Mackie and I have 'been wondering whether Kamar Bay , where H, H. says there is oil and which I mentioned to you in my last d, o. letter lies i. e. whether in Bushire political jurisdiction or in Aden political jurisdiction. Itjis clear now from LorimeriGaze\eer Vol 1 ( Historical) pp 592 # 593 that this matter was decided by the Govt of India in 1879• The boundary betv/een the two Residencies is RAS SAJAR , which is east of Kamar Bay, and the latter place ( the bay ) is therefore not in Dhofar, Vol 11 of the same compilation p. 446 gives Kharifot as the western, -most in the Dhofar District ( see remark column ).re Also the Hand Book of Arabia , Admiralty War Staff , 1916 Vol 1 p. 279 says ' Dhofar is employed for the whole coas tract from Has Nus westward to a point beyond the vil^. of Kharifot' , which on page 281 of the same hook is desci as the westernmost settlement of Dhofar.

We would further request your favourable consideration of our application that an extension be granted beyond the 31st March next for the recognition by His Majesty's Government of our prior rights to these Concessions- Owing to causes beyond our control, such as the provision by His Majesty's Government the negotiations were to be inaugurated and carried oh by the Political ResidentResident, it is doubtful if these matters can be brought to a successful conclusion within the next six weeks.

'2. / , ^ — • l_ jliiyouii Reply Please N o- I4 6 6 14th APRIL. 1925, Dear Colonel Prideaux, Mr* Amery and Sir John Shuckburgh visited us on 10th instant and left the same evening. It was veiy disappointing to me to learn from them that you had sailed for Bushire the previous day for I was counting upon a full discussion of the situation of our negotiations at Muscat before you re turned to Bushire, with the very special opporttanity to re present the same to Mr* Amery and Sir John Shuckburgh at the same time, I was able, however, to discuss matters with them, to explain the Company's points of view on certain matters and how these were at variance with those of the Colonial Office. I stated that there were apparently two questions only upon which we and the Colonial Office are in disagreement namely:- (l) Limitation of the area to be covered by the Concession at Muscat. Our reason^ for asking that there should be no limitation but that the Concession should extend to 'the whole of the territories under his (the Sul-(-26) Ag Sultan's) rule' mm the admission ty all, the Sultan included, that he could not guarantee to the Company safety to prospect and later undertake drilling work throughout the whole of hi« domain. Therefore to call upon us to choose specific areas in due course would mean that we could not do so with assurance of being ahle to carry on our operation« in any one of these. The Sultan had been the first to recognise this and had himself asked that there should be no limitation of area but that an additional provision should be accepted by us J0 limiting his responsibility within a certain section of Oman, over which he has tjot effective control. This we have already expressed our willingness to accept, and Mr. Amery and Sir John Shuckburgh gave me to understand that they consider our representations in this direction merit favourable consideration# Limitation of -period of exemption from Customs duty . I explained that our agreements against any limitation of area could be followed in this second issue also # The Company would be forking - or endeavouring to work - in districts largely uncontrolled by the nominal ruler. It may be anticipated that only by local arrangements with semi-independent Shaikhs should we be able to carry forward with any degree of continuity our work of exploration prospecting and, later 'Mining': it is only by such agree-agreements with local Shaikhs in certain districts that the Sultan can maintain peace within his borders. It is clear that, under such difficult circumstances, restriction to a limited period within which the Coy # can enjoy the benefit of freedom from import duty must greatly discount the value of this Concession# Any sets-back to our operations during the period of the Mining Lease (and we must be prepared to experience such delays in but partially controlled territories) might make serious inroads into the 10 years 1 limitation period* It will not be until, having completed our pros** peeting work, we proceed to development operation, that drilling etc. material will be imported in large quantities: hence it is during this, the actual Concession period, that we are chiefly cnncerned with free importa tion facilities and would be gravely handicapped by being limited as to the period of this benefit# Mr® Amery confinned that if, at the expiry of the prescribed 10 years, the Company could shew good reason for requiring an extension, our claim would have the support of the British Government. I represented that this could not be a satisfactozy arrangement from the Company's point of view. Ten years from the commencement of the mining lease we should undoubtedly be importing considerable quantities of drilling etc plant and machinery( - 4- ) ^&gt;v and it seemed to me|extremely improbable that the Sultan, seeing the chance to collect import duty thereon, would in his cupidity be willing to listen to any representa** tions for continued remission, however f«w and well founded these might be, but would stand firm for his legal ri^its* I concluded by a general review of the situation up to the point reached at that date, explaining that owing apparently to some misunderstanding the Colonial Office and the Company have been at cross-purposes, which had resulted in your having received directions not to permit the Sultan of Muscat to agree to withdrawal of the two 'limitation' provisions, whereas we had definite advice of the Sultan's willi^igneBB to do so - in fact his wish to do so in respect to area limitation. I emphasised the point that^ the unstable political conditions within the territories of the Sultan, must ren der our operations there peculiarly difficult. We should undoubtedly be faced with the onus and expense of making subsidiary agreements with local Shaikhs solely because the Sultan of Muscat had not the power to control certain Sectinns of his territories and to ensure us freedom and protection of action. Therefore, in actual fact, the Sultan would be signing an agreement one of the most essential obliga*-* tions of which he could not, by his own admission.I ( - 5 . ) guarantee to carry, out. We appreciate his difficulty and have readily met the Sultan (vide my earlier writing in this letter) but we maintain that in return we are entitled to claim the two correlative considerations which form the subjects of my present writings Taking due account^ of all circumstances in our negotiations with the Sultan of Muscat, the peculiarly difficult conditions with which we must expect to con tend in our exploratory, prospecting and development activities, the extremely hamdsome rate of royalty offered as far back as September 1923, and still offered today when the same is materially more handsome, I cannot but think the terms of agreement now offered to the Sultan are in every way most generous# Sir John Shuckburgh told me that he would ask you to proceed forthwith to Muscat, and that he was cabling the Colonial Office to such effect recommending that it should be left to the Financial Adviser to the Sultan, in communication with you, to report to the Colonial Office recommendations as to acceptance or otherwise of the terms offered by the Company#Is i~6 - ) I ehall, therefore, look forward with much interest to learn what may now transpire. Yours sincerely. Lieut#Col» F* PricLeaux, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRE* BBBSBUSHiRE RESIDENCY. •vUi 'iit 2^2' Lf o-j Muscat CONFIDENTIAL BEGOROS.

Dear AllDan, This is to acknowledge receipt of my returned letter and copy addressed to Sir Arnold Wilson A.P.0.0. under flying seal. I am most worried ahout the whole thing. The letter inten -ded to give our Oil Concessionaires advice semi-officially so that they, could sound S.N.O. ahout the movements of a ship in neighbouring waters 'before approaching the Political Resident and you officially with their proposed programme . But it never entered my head that this letter should issue without first 'being seen 'by you. What happened as you may rememher is that the letter was drafted and typed on the morning of my departure for India. I 'brought the draft round to your house 'before 'break -fast and toldv hai: a letter I was most anxious for you to see,'but the letter 'being in manuscript and the hour 'breakfast time it was deemed 'better to wait until typed.There were so many letters to sign that day and so many people to see-you will remeinber waiting lunch for me till 3.30 and it was touch and go whether I caught the skip- that in the hurry and ezcite- -ment the letter was overlooked and issued to P.E# 1 without your having seen it. I feel sure you will recall the circum stances and appreciate that I acted absolutely in good faith. As regards the letter passing through P.H. under flying seal I see now what did not strike me then that this course may 'be construed as not showing a proper regard on my part for the F.R's office,'but I felt at the time that only in that way would the object 'be served conditioned 'by my undivided respon- -siMlity for the advice in the letter. This is not written in a spirit of self justification : 'but it is worrying me a good deal to think that the Colonel may harbour the impression that I consciously acted either in a highhanded way vis a vis his office,or not in good faithfaith vis a vis yours &gt; Tours Sincerely Captain G.E.Al'ban I,A.
