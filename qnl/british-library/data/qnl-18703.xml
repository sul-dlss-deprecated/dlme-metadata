                           Centaur'splundered cargo of indigo (see ff 129-130 of IOR/R/15/1/130). Arnold Burrowes Kemball, Resident in the Persian Gulf, encloses letters (not included) addressed to the maritime chiefs on either side of the Gulf and requests that George Robinson, Commander of the Indian Naval Squadron in the Persian Gulf, forward them to their destination by the Honourable Company's steam frigate
                           Queen. Kemball states that the documents in question consist either of direct appeals from Kemball to the independent Arabian chiefs, or of similar orders from the Prince Governor of Fars to the subordinate authorities on the Persian coast, intimating the British Government's expectation that they (the Arabian chiefs and Persian authorities respectively) will seize and detain any consignments of indigo which may be brought for sale to their ports. Kemball states that, as the indigo plundered from the
                           Centaurrepresented the whole supply of the present season for the Persian Gulf, any importations which may be effected at its ports must be portions of the cargo of that vessel.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023612308.0x000007#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
