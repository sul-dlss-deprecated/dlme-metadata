IBN SA'UD. Notes bv Colonel ir&lt;nnilton, Political Agent, Koweit, based on conversations at Hiviidli in November 1917. [Received through Arab Bureau, Iraq Section.) I. T bn t S a ud s T itf.i:. Ibn Sri'ud is frequently referred to by us as His Excellency or His Honour the Amir of Xajd (or ol Central Arabia). , fn his own dominions lie is spoken of by respectful persons as the Imam, while the Beduin call him familiarly 'Abdul 'Aziz or llnkkam iplnral of llakkim). In Riyadh there is a chance of being 1 misunderstood in calling him Imam, as that is also the title of his father Abdur Hahaman. Ibn Sa'ud does not like to be called the Amir, as that is the courtesy title commonly given to headmen of towns and villages. He prefers to be addressed officially as Hakim Xajd. It would, therefore, seem that the best official title would be His rJxcellencu the Ruler (Uadhr-at-al-flnkim) of Xajd. II. Rklatioxs with the Tribks ('Aj.MAX, &amp;c.). Ibn Sa ud's attitude towards the 'Ajman has undergone no change. He considers it is quite hopeless to arrange any terms with them, as they are born and sworn enemies of his, and are notorious even among Arabs for treachery and disregard for all contracts. They do not obey their Shaikhs, and frequently set at nought tribal customs of fundamental importance. Moreover, the 'Ajman have not abideil by the terms imposed upon them by the Government with Bin Sa'ud's consent and approval, as drawn up at Kuwait in November 1910. As soon as Ibn SVud began to gather the clans for his march upon Ibn Rashid, the'A jman under all the Shaikhs ol the Ibn llithlain went off to Ibn Uashid, and, taking station upon his Hank, immobilised a large proportion of his force, and contributed to the general failure of his intended offensive. 1 hey have only come in now because they are hard up for provisions. Ibn Sa ud considers, and nothing will convince him of the contrary, that Il)n Sabbah's (Salim of Kuwait) allowing them to enter his territories is a distinctly unfriendly act, and is so understood by all Arabs. His differences with [bn Sabbah are entirely on account of the 'Ajman, Even his taxation of the 'Awazim (who, he says, with all the desert tribes really belong to his confederation) is, he hints, his reply to Ibn Sabbah's unfriendly conduct in harbouring his enemies the 'Ajman. He greatly dislikes Salim personally, in spite of the fact that Salim is so strict a Moslim, so severe a Puritan, that he is as WaUabi as any man jack of the Kajdis. Salim is close-iisted, he says; but another reason, i suspect, is the mutual jealousy, felt in this instance to a greater extent by Salim than Ibn Sa'ud. Just as the latter complains that we have shown in his regard undue favouritism toward the Sharif, so Salim asks me why we subsidise Ibn Sa'ud to the extent of 5,0001. a month, implying, though of course not saying, that we do nothing for him. I argued the case in favour of the Ajman at several long interviews, but failed to move Ibn Sa'ud to relent beyond offering the following conditions to the 'Ajman : — Alternative (I).—That the tribe should move off at once en masse to assist Ibn Hadhdhal and the Xorthern 'Anizah. Alternative (2).—That several of the principal Shaikhs should come into Riyadh and surrender and leave hostages for their future good behaviour; the tribe- might then move to Qasini to the Ataibah dirah and remain quiet. S 15 40 7,18 At) On no account will Ibn Sa'ml Lear of their repatriation in 1 las ;1 This, he says woul.l render his rear and commnnications with Hasa and the coast so insemire that I k - would be unable to undertake any movement at a distance Irom the capital. There is much to he said for Ibn Sa'ud's attitude towards this tribe I'rom old times the 'Ajman have been rebels. Time after time Ib« band and his lor .ears have been compelled to inflict severe pumshment; but they have proved incapable .,1 reform remaining natural rebels. A sort of local Inshry for whom there ,s no romedv but to l.e placed outside the Pale. It is acknowledged mi, versa ly that the 'Aiman do not obey their Shaikhs in ordinary times, though ready enough to follow il.,:,., In,nlinit.lv m war. Their best, friends, am! blood connections. them and obey them implicitly in such 'is the Ibn Sabbah, admit that thev are unreliable and notorious brigaiuU even amoncv Arabs. I hoped last year that the tribe had perceived the necessity for a policv of friendiv submission to the British Government and that they wonld^ have remained passively in the tract allotted to them between Kuwait and /nbair. They, however chose to go after Dhaidan, the friend ot Ajaimi and ihe Shamniar, who oave out to them and others that the Turks were about to send 30,000 men down the Shamiyah bank of the Euphrates to help their partisans. Dhaidan and the 'Ajman have alleged to me that their reasons for leaving Kuwait and Zubair were fear of Ibn Sa'ud's tribes when they began to move and the necessity for finding grazing for the tioeks and herds. There may be something in this latter statement as all the tribes made a dash for the splendid spring pasturage which was obtainable between Qasim and Jabal Shammar this year, that to the north being of proportionately poor quality. My conversations with Ibn Sa'ud, however, have convinced me that if friendly relations are to be restored between him and Kuwait, or even if he is to retain full confidence in ns, the 'Ajman must be moved off from their present position athwart the commnnications between Qasim and Kuwait. And I have come to the conclusion that unless we comply by, if necessary, bringing pressure to bear on the Shaikh of Kuwait to evict the tribe or by accepting their submission ourselves on conditions above mentioned, we cannot expect greater activity on the part of Ibn Sa'ud, much less that he should throw himself heart and soul into the task of crushing Ibn llashid, and thereafter perhaps joining forces with the Sharif to make a clean sweep of the Turks out of Arabia and Southern Syria. It must be remembered that Lbn Sa'ud has great difficulty in managing the great confederation of tribes which acknowledge his religions and secular leadership. According to him, they consist of Mutair, 'Awazim, Bani llajar, Manasir, Ajman, Beni Khalid, Bani Abdallah, Qahtan, Duwasir, Subai', Sahul, 'Anizah, 'Ataibah, and Harb. That is to say, practically all the tribes of Central and North Arabia. Over some of these his dominion is somewhat shadowy no doubt, and, as regards the Harb at least, is in dispute with the Sharif. However, Ibn Sa nd might easily carry all these tribes with him for a grand movement if he himself came up to the scratch and were provided with the money to finance such an enterprise. Garrisons would have to be left behind in Hasa, Riyadh, and the provincial towns, and arrangements made for the maintenance of order among the tribes during the absence of the main expedition : a task this of great magnitude, but one for which, fortunately, Ibn Sa'ud could lind trustworthy wardens from among various loyal and competent members of his own house. If, therefore, it is desired that Ibn Sa'ud should undertake a movement on a considerable scale, we must arrange to side-track the 'Ajman or to draw their teeth in some effective manner. It would be well, then, to summon the headmen of the tribe into Uasrah or Kuwait to hear the decision of Government and to make their choice between suhwnssion to Ibn Sand in accordance with the terms stated above, or to quit the territories of all tribes friendly to Government. ] laxing discussed the question of submission to Ibn Sa'ud with Dhaidan himself, and learnt fiom Ins lips that, the tribe would prefer to wander for ever in strange duahs rathei than to lotuin under Ibn baud, I have little hope that he is likely to pio\e compliant , and he will probably take the tribe with him for the present into the Shaminai diiah. Ibn Sa ud says that the Ajman sections in rebellion could not possibly mustci moie than l.oOO lighting men, that if Ibn Sabbah or Zubair have not the force to exuet them he will undertake the job. Ibn Sa'ud knows that there is a likelihood that we shall take him at his word in this instance and is prepared to move upon a signal from us My opinion is that the 'Ajman, who have grown weaker as a result of their wanderings, will cave in to Ibn Sa'ud, unless the Shammar give them asylum or we take responsibility for them again at Zubair or elsewhereIII.

This, however, he ealisi s, U II 1 Ibe Aslam and other sections being exempt themselves and engaged all Ibe time in blockade nuimng, is scarcely practicable. If we treated all the Ibammar as a c oi poiate boii\, and relnsed to have any further relations with Jbn Tnwalah and ..tner sections now posing as friendly until the whole tribe submitted, there is not the s glrtesl donbt that the Shammar would be isolated to such an extent that they would have no alternative to surrender. I be screw must, similarly, be put on the 'Anizah tbej must be treated not by sections but as a corporate whole. Ibn Sa'nd suggests that a larger share in the control of Central Arabian traffic should be in his bands; that be should have agents at each of the chief market towns under British occupation or suzerainty; and that these agents should be consnlted before anyexpor passes are granted. J 1 IV. Attitude towards Kino Husain. ll)n Sa'ud is consumed with jealousy of Sharif Husain, King of the Hijaz, and Hns jealousy has late y been fanned to a white heat by the hitter's assumption of the title of King of Arabia (Malak al diyar, or, bilad al Arab). The Sharif has been ■ ecemng iaige. subsidies Irom us, and lias gathered round him not only all the clans ot the llijaz and neighbouring districts, but has also drawn to his side all the Ataibali and harl). tribes which Ibn Sa'iul claims as belonging to him. Latterly ai^o iiiun icrs o( Aqail or Najd townsmen attracted by high pay have levanted to k J; 11 110111 Anaizah, ihiraidah, Sharah, and Midhnib. These 'Aqail represent some of the best fighting stock in the country. The Amirs of 'Anaizah and Midhnib assmcl me lhat 110 less than 4,(H)0 of them had joined the Sharif's forces from Qasim alone, and these do not include Heduin. In thfcoi 1 rso ol (conversation Ibn Sa'ud has frequently appealed for equalitv of tieatment vith the Sliaril'. lie hints that we have left him in the cold while doing evei^thing lor his rival, lie complains that Ave have not given him due credit for ii-. (^po 11^11 of our cause and uncompromising hostility towards the Turks; he even (• aims ci(' &lt; lii for the lact that, but for his benevolent attitude toward the Sharif and ii&gt; hoMin.i; tne Shammar in check, the former's rebellion would have had nochanceof hik ce^s. Me said that he had resisted many tempting offers from the Turks who were always altemptin^ to reopen negotiations with him. As proof of this latter statement lies.lowed mo a tetter Irom I'akhri Pasha, Commandantat Afedinah, asking him why he had not replied to his friendly letter of the year previous. I saw also the letter lelened to. hoiii appeared to be quite genuine. If he has been carrying on any l^' 11 ' 11 ' 11 ' ias ''^en with Pakhri Pasha's superiors at Damascus or elsewhere.

Jbn Sa ud, however, 'I 1 ? ? h tth e^uaUv His mind harps on the question of the thinks 'e shorn le. ■ii,... ili'slrossfnllv between the disadvantages that will Ulhunconditions l^uU in the victory of the Allies or the reiitnl Powers. 00 ^Ve have sometimes thought that his possession ol llasa, which is of such 'Teat importance to his Emirate, from which he expelled the i nils a short Ume before th,. war, would be an overwhelming argument .n our favour : that he could only hope to keep it by holding on to our sk.rts. But such, I am reliably kforined is n't reallv the case. Whichever side should win, he does not believe be will be allowed to hold on to llasa for long, in view of the well-known cupidity am acouisitiveness of great Powers. What is certain is that, should the A lies win and the Turks be driven out of Arabia, he will have the mortihcation ol limling Ins nva the Sharif firmly established as an influential and powerful monarch able to count on the support of Great liritain and the Mahommedan world, while be Jim hand) remains a mere Beduin chieftain—as he was before the war—but with the Sbnmmar and Northern 'Anizah irretrievablv lost and the Sharif claiming overlor(lslii|) over the border tribes. If, on the other hand, the Central Powers conquer as be thinks they 'will he will have the satisfaction of seeing King Husain go down, while as regards his own position he relies on his political acumen to drive some sort of bargain with the Turks. m , . t rn i i • This rioes not mean that Ibn Sa'ud is pro-lurk. Ue hates the lurk as his ancestors did and he likes and admires ihe British, infidels though they are. Hut it is a matter of policy, and when policy is concerned he must regard the matter entirely from the point of view of self-interest, i.e., the interests ol his dynasty and the Wahabi faith, lie will not be induced to take any action unless the object is justified primarily in these interests; in other words he has got it into his head that he is not going to pull the chestnuts out of the tire lor us or for anyone. I his is perhaps the reason that Ibn Sa'ud has not attempted seriously to take I lail or performed any noteworthy feat during the war. lie hopes that, when our subsidies cease, the tribes now supporting the Sharif will return to their former allegiance, lie says that the Sharif is already on bad terms with some of the llarb and told me one day with manifest elation that the Uaqhah section of the 'Ataibahhad been converted in a body to the 'Ikhwan,' a religious brotherhocd which Ibn Sa'ud is fostering to the utmost of his ability. If the view of Ibn Sa'ud's policy which 1 have endeavoured to set down is correct, it can be seen how foolish it would be to expect any thorough going co-operation from him even if more liberally Subsidised. Indeed it is quite probable that any additional subsidies we may give him would be used to buy back llarb and Ataibali Chiefs who are now with the Sharif. The only means 1 can think of that would induce him to suuutt as a i rmct; vis-u-vis tue j\iiig ol me mjaz ; aner win money and arms, would have to be given with a liberal hand. What could ^ give as his part of the bargain? From my observation of the esteem in which 'Abdul Aziz is held in Central and South Central Arabia, 1 believe that I k 4 could, i he chose to put his heart into it, raise the whole country. V. Ibn Sa'ud's Desiderata. The following conditions would completely satisfy Ibn Sa'ud :— (I.) That we should observe towards him the sam^policy of trust and coniidence as we pursue in the case of the Sharif. (2.) treating him on an equality with the Sharif, we should acknowledge his hegemony in Najd, Central Arabia and its dependencies and, as we have conceded the fStyle and Utle of I lis I Ijghness King of the Hijaz to the latter, we should proclaim him as His Highness the llakim (or Ruler) of Najd. (3.) That all tribal allowances made by us to the tribes of Central Arabia including the Anizah and 'Ataibah, Mutair, Subai, Bani Hajar, Qahtan, Dawasir' i anasir, A hi ^hirrah, 15. A lxlaJIah, Sahul, 'Ajman, Shammar, and Dhafir should be paid through Ibn Sa ud and the British Resident accredited to him. r&gt; v • ^ I il' iat 1 t ' ie ' Government should be permanently represented bv a rohtical Kesident. J (5.) That the control of the caravan traffic of the interior from Karbala, Samawah v i.iiinsi\ &lt;iji,/uban, Kuwait, Qatr and other markets siioidd be delegated to Ibn Sa'ud and Ins Hritish Resident, the former keeping agents at each of these markets. (0.) That subsidies should be granted him, with war material, the* loan of engineers and instructors, in proportion to the magnitude of operations expected of him or ol the armed forces he is required to keep up. (-.) That we should assist him to re-establish trade in the ports of Hasa bv arranging for a regular steamship service with India. (8.) That the terms of an agreement on these lines be reduced in a formal document or Treaty similar to the existing Treaty. In this Treaty the position of Abdul Aziz Ibn Sa'ud would be defined and the succession of heirs of his body would be guaranteed. On his part Ibn Sa'ud would agree to act in subordinate co-operation with us in an offensive and defensive alliance, engaging specifically nut to enter into any sort of relation with any other Power but the British, or with any Arab Chief or nation, whether under our protection or under the protection of another tribe. \ote. —This is the maximum, and a much modified arrangement on these lines would be acceptable.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002b0_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B286</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0002b0</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B286</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Ibn Sa'ud.
