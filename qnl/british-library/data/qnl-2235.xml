Section 2. 4 [E 2385/2385/89] Copy No. H2 Consul MacKereth to Mr. Eden.—(Received April 30.) gj r Damascus, April 23, 1937. WITH reference to the visit of Dr. Naji Aseel, the Iraqian Foreign Minister, who arrived in Damascus yesterday in order to sign, on behalf of Iraq, a treaty of “ Bon-voisinage ” with the Syrian Republic, I have the honour to inform you that I attended a banquet last night given by the Syrian Foreign Minister to his Iraqian vis-d-vis. 2. The two statesmen made post-prandial speeches, of which I enclose translations for your information. The Syrian Government have seized upon this occasion to mark with much eclat the notable fact that they are performing their first sovereign act in signing an international convention with an indepen dent foreign Power. The wider Arabian aspect was also emphasised. No effort was spared to disguise the disagreeable but obvious fact that it was the French High Commissioner who was the qualified agent for the execution of this inter national deed; the apposition of the signature of the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs being little more than a sop to Syrian susceptibilities. This ghost at the feast was effectively dissembled by the cordiality of the atmosphere, which was clouded only by the smoke of magnesium flares let off by the photographers commissioned to record the historic occasion for posterity. 3. I had a chat after dinner with Dr. Naji Aseel and learned from him that after signing the Iraqo-Syrian treaty he was going to Angora to discuss, and possibly initial, a similar agreement with Turkey. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s representatives in Bagdad, Beirut and Aleppo. I have, &amp;c. GILBERT MacKERETH. Enclosure 1. Translation of the Speech of the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sa adullah-al-Jabri, April 22, 1937. Excellency (addressing the Iraqian Foreign Minister), I BRING you the greetings of the Syrian Republic, and I cordially welcome you. I am overjoyed by the happy occasion which allows us to receive the Foreign Minister of the Arab country, which we look upon as a part of ourselves, the Arab country that, by the steps taken to reach its independence traced for us the glorious path upon which we have set our feet. I congratulate myself and I share the enormous pleasure which the Syrian people feel, that it is by an Act of good neighbourly relations with Iraq with which we initiate the exercise of our sovereign rights in its external manifesta tions. This Act will tighten the bonds which have never ceased to exist between Damascus and Bagdad. It is our two countries which, from the early dawn of history, have borne aloft the torch of Arab civilisation and which have been the theatre of the greatest events in our glorious past. It is especially agreeable to me at this turning-point in our national life to draw attention to the noble efforts which France, our great ally, has not spared herself in order to develop the friendly relations which have existed in the past between herself and the Arab nations of the Near East and which endure in the present. May I also be permitted at this juncture to remind you of the close ties existing between the Arab countries and the great democracies of the [981 gg 2] l•2 West. It cannot be doubted that this collaboration will, as is our hope, bear fruit, and that it will bind us closer with the bonds of mutual trust to our common advantage. I will close by addressing to His Majesty the King of Iraq, heir of Feisal the Great and his perpetuator, the respectful homage of the Syrian nation, coupled with our most ardent wishes for the happiness of his reign and the prosperity of his country and for the radiance of the Arab ideal which thrills our hearts with the memories of a glorious past and for which we await a brilliant future. Enclosure 2. Translation of the Reply of the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs, Naji A seel, April 22, 1937. Excellency, Ladies and Gentlemen, I AM grateful that circumstances have permitted me to visit the brother- country of Syria which undoubtedly forms an integral part of our still greater national fatherland, and I rejoice to find it following with great strides the path of its supreme ideal and achieving its national sovereignty in a way which Iraq regards with satisfaction and delight. I am all the more happy that it has fallen to my lot to represent the Government of His Majesty the King for the signing of the “ Bon-Voisinage ' Agreement, by which Syria inaugurates the exercise of her sovereignty over her foreign relations. The brotherly ties and the mutual interests which unite our two countries are in themselves guarantees of a permanent and eternal solidarity in the relations between us. It is. moreover, a matter for jubilation that the two countries are uniting their efforts for the revival of our ancient Arab glory and for their reborn civilisations. I share to the full the sentiments of his Excellency the Minister, who has just paid homage to the solicitude of the great French Republic and to her efforts to develop friendly relations between herself and the Arab Near East. I feel honoured to be the bearer to my august sovereign of the greetings and homage of the people of Damascus and to be the interpreter of his good wishes on behalf of my country. I will close by offering my warmest thanks to the President of the Republic, to his Government and to the noble Syrian people, for the cordial, sincere and fraternal welcome which has been reserved for us. I ask the Almighty to give to the era now opening under the rule of your President, prosperity, well-being and progress.% V Copy (E 4634/2385/89) No. 306.
