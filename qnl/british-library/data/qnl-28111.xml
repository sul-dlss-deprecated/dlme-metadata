THE RSSIjENCY, BauuDAD, the 20th May, 1929. Sir, I have the honour to refer to the Buke of Devonshire’s despatch No.1101 dated the 1st of November, ItA ^ and to para^aph 10 of Sir Henry Dobbs’ despatch T o, 1 6b daoed tne 7th or November, 1924, relative to the protection of the interests of Portuguese subjects in this country. ^• it will be remembered that in 1924 the number of Goanese in ’Iraq was said to be in the nei^hoourhood 1,^00. fhis estimate may nov/ be .greatly reduced, but no definite figure can be given. In the records of the years 124-28 it is difficult to trace a single instance of a Poi wuguese subjeco having applied to my Secretariat i.or assistance such as he would expect to receive from a Portuguese Consul. Although, as explained in bir Henry Doobs’ despatch quoted, facilities do exist here for the registration of Portuguese births, deaths and marriages, only two birtns, one death and nine marriages have in fact been so registered since that despatch was written. As you are aware the registers of births, deaths and marriages maintained under the British Subjects’ Registra tion of Births, Deaths and Marriages Proclamation, 1919, were transferred to my Secretariat in 1925. Maintenance ofof the registers of Portuguese subjects was undertaken by my Consular Secretary at the same time. 3 f Now however that all British passport work in 1 Iraq has been taken over by the British Consuls in Baghdad and Basrah the question assumes greater prominence. British Indians now obtain their*passports from the British Consulates in Baghdad and Basrah instead of from the ’Iraq Passport Bureaux and Goanese are accustomed to expect treatment similar to that accorded to British Indians. Consequently applications from Goanese for issue and renewal of passports are being r.ade to those Consulates. With the general institution of British consular registration of residents, Goanese are likely to revive their claims to British protection. It appears therefore that the time has come to re^plarise the position, and I should be glad to be informed whether British Consular Officers in ’Iran are definitely entrusted with the protection of Portuguese interests. If so, I would be grateful for a definition of the extent of the protection to be afforded, and, in particular, for guidance as to the action to be tahen when applications for Portuguese passports are received by British Consular Officers in 'Iraq. 4. As I understand that this protection of Portuguese interests by British Consular Officers has bean undertaken in the past at consular posts in the Persian Gulf, I have caused copies of this despatch to be sent to the 'Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment and the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, in case they desire to make any observations on the subject. I have, etc. (Signed) GILBERT CLAYTON. AG.

The Treasury have been considering uhis question since 1924. The Britisljcommercial Community at Basrah are not satisfied with the arrangement whereby the ’Administrative Inspector', an Iraq official, acts as f British Consul. They complain that they are not sufficiently safeguarded. The High Commissioner supports the traders, for administrative reasons: the present arrangement is unsatisfactory in many ways, and there is a considerable loss to Imperial Revenues owing to the absence of a proper visa system and system for collecting shipping fees, etc. The Foreign Office d*o not appear 2069d 2000 6.27 ' ‘ . to be very ranch interested, but the Colonial Office strongly support.the JJlah Commissioner C °WM/77B ? Previous Papers :— It1 Uli«LV* &lt;• l JK. tl lV. . i. j.ix'vj ' 1. It is difficult to see what objection the Treasury can have to the scheme, if the High Commissioner’s figures and estimates are anywhere near the mark. In 1924 (P. 1898/24) the total upkeep cost of the proposed consulate was estimated at £1600 a year, as against receipts of £900, Sir H. Dobbs’ present figure of estimated 'increase in British Consular receipts' (if proper consular arrangements are made) is Rs.21,717. This should just about cover expenditure . . ' -’r r . If the Consulate is going to pay, or nearly pay, its way, the question of incidence of cost between Imperial and Indian revenues^become^ somewhat ti academic. So far as India is concerned, we are still awaiting a reply from the Foreign Office to this Office letter of the 15th July, 1925, P. 1103/25, which represented that the Government of India objected in principle to paying a contribution to the cost, and proposed to appoint a separate representative. If, however, the net cost of the consulate is to be small or nil, no doubt either (a) His Majesty’s Government will agree to bear the whole cost, to avoid the danger of being inconvenienced by a separate Indian representative, or (b) fafet 0 the Government of India will sink their prejudice against a contribution, in view of the very heavy expense in which a separate representative would involve them. All this is on the assumption that the Treasury will be awakened from their stupor. Secretary. E. &amp; 0, Department. Secretary, Pinanciai Department, for information and any remarks. CjjUuutU UiK.

Sir, i have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with my despatch No.507 dated the 15th of April, 1927, regarding the proposal to appoint a British Consul at Basrah. 2. You will recollect that in 1924 (vide my despatob ho. 168 dated the 7th of Fehruarv, 1924) 1 ed recommend^to your predecessor the appointment of a full time British Consul at Basrah and discussed in that despatch the probable cost of such an appointment to Bis Majesty's Government. Since then the proposal has not progressed. 1 understand that Bis Majesty's Treasury do not consider that in existing circumstances such an appointment is justified. 1 feel, however, that the question cannot be allowed to remain in abeyance indefinitely. The British conroercial coronunity at Basrah refer to it from time to time, and are evidently still convinced that the absence of a British Consul is injurious to their interests. 1 enclose a memorandum (marked 'A*), setting out their views, recently supplied to my Secretariat By Mr 0. wills, Manager in Basrah of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited (an Inchcape concern) and President of the oritish Chamber of Commerce TBB BIGHT HONOURABLE L.U.M.S. AMaRY, P.C., M.P., aSCHSTAHY OF STATE JOB THE COLOi.iiSS, O.thii.G STREET. LONDON, S. A.1.f Cawt 3 roe in that Uity. ^ou will observe that Mr fills reiterates the argument that the interests of British cemercial houses are not sufficiently protected vis a vis the 1 Iraq Government with an official of that Government acting as British Consul, The foreign Office have indeed endorsed this view by their refusal to permit the appointment of the Administrative inspector in an official Consular capacity, 1 fear that the enclosed memorandum toes little to i/idicate tne precise nature of the tfork to be undertaken by a full-tiT?© Consul vrhich is not already performed at oasrah. in practice cases of conflicting interests must be comparatively rare: in feet during the pest four years t‘je Commercial community have /iot diclosed any specific instance of importance: while it my be argued that, if not satisfied with the Administrative Inspector's support in any particular instance, it is always open to them to appeal to the high Comiss inner at Baghdad, Nevertheless there is no doubt that a genuine desire for the appointment does exist, furthermore although the British traders of aasrah do not touch on this point in stating their case, it is clear that at the present time, through the lack of a properly accredited Consular Officer, the public services normally carried out by a British Consul are, of necessity, performed in an irregular and in some instances an inadequate mnner at aasrah, i will discuss this seriatim in paragraphs 3 to 9 below, 3. As is shown by the figures given in the enclosed memorandum, Basrah is a port of which the importance is increasing, it should be noted that the Port of b&amp;srah includes the anchorage at Abadan in which normally a number of the Anglo Persian Oil Company’s fleetfleet of t sake re lie* i’urtuer at baa rah itself may oceaa goiog steamere regularly put ia aad are moored either at the wharves or in the stream for oeasiderable periods. The duties aor.nally carried out by &amp; British Consul in respect of British snipping have to be performed* These, for some years, have been in the hands of the Director of the Fort of Basrah who is authorised to correspond direct with the board of Trade (vide Colonial Office despatch 'Miscellaneous 1 dated the B7th of July, 1925)* naether such an arrangement can confer upon this officer of the 'Iraq Government any legal status under the British Merchant shipping Acts 1 am unable jo say, but 1 am advised that in any case his powers cannot extend beyond the frontiers of 1 Iraq* The Fort Director has thus no authority to deal with matters involving nritxsh shipping outside 1 Iraq waters* .*hen the Crovemment of &amp;urnm recently invited m to arrange an enquiry into the circumstances of a marine collision which occurred outside the texritorial waters of 'Iraq, the conclusion was reached that no useful purpose would be served if the Fort Director were to hold such an enquiry, because the extent, if any, of his powers under British law, ms too obscure. The view of the Adviser to the Ministry of Justice was that he had and Indian no such powers, and that «ftiilst portions of the British^ Merchant Shipping dots had been applied to 'Iraq by Proclamation, and did etill so apply, this could not confer jurisdiction on the Fort Director as a British authority in 'Iraq. Similarly it has recently been ruled by the Foreign Office (vide your telegram ft 0.373 dated the 20th of October, 1927) that the Administrative inspector at ^asr&amp;h cannot be considered &amp; Consular Officer4, Officer within the Meaning of the British Merchant* ahipping Acts and haa not the right to ait on a iiritiah naaal Goukt of inquiry i i the capacity of Consul. The appointment of a regular Consul would, 1 take it, enable navrl Courts of inquiry to be held in due form at nasrah at times when no Senior naval Officer is available. There j.3 thus a lacuna in the existing arrangements as regards naval disoipiint which mi ht be eliminated by the appointment of a british Consul, a. Of tho duties usual 1/ porlor^od by Coiisulrir Ofliceis dxx cbr the uorohante Shippiag; such services as the on aiic. off of 8eameA # tfte noti/v? of marine protests and the like are carried out by tne Port Director, lor these services fees are recovered ay him «hioh are not by any means identical with the hritisn Cons ularfses prescribed for the same services. The proceeds^accrue to ’Ir^ revenues. Detail® of the shippi^g^f this nature t^.ken u/*der tne authority of the Fort Director during the financial year 1926-4i7 are shown in the Schedules attached (marked *B1* and “b 2'). in ik,. ii„ dt „ schedule £* an attest has ueen made to translate tne figures given by the Port Director into terms of the British Conaulai' fee ta.ble and thus to indicate what would have been collected b&gt; a nritish Consul during the year, fhe result may nob be precisely accurate but servos to indicate the amounts iUivolved. it snows potential takings by a o^tnd durin the y»ar ot i s.8 t 201/- at Abadan and ii.l,M7/11A at basrah. Thepe ©re substantial suns now lost to British revenues. Unfor tunately however the figures indicate that the greater part of the potential shipping revenue of the -asrah Consulate accrues at Abadan, and presumaoly therefore that Uj© greater pai‘t of the Consul*s work &lt;/ould have to be done at Abadan if he were to collect Uiese fees, or that some official at Aoadaxi would have5, to bo iaoetod with powers to collect the fees there on behalf of the Basrah Consul, the distance between Abadan and Basrah being too great for the Consul to undertake the work at both places, in ?iew of the fact that the ’iraq-Persian frontier at Abadan is the low water mark on the Persian shore, it would appear that the shipping fees could not properly be collected on shore / (“d therefore in Persia) by a British Consul accredited to the 'Iraq and not the Persian GoTernment. These diflicuities might perhaps best be overcome if it were possible to arrange that the Port official who at present performs the services in question at Abadan should be invested with authority under the Consul at Basrah enabling him to continue to do so, out with provision that he should credit the fees levied to the Consulate. 1 do not anticipate that the Port authorities would object to ouch an arrangement. 5. The existing procedure as regards British passports and visas at Basrah is anomalous and must soon be regularised, ihe Administrative Inspector issues British foreign Office paevporte to Britieh subjects but, haring no consular status and consequently no powers to use consular staupe, he charges for those passports the 'Iraq fees of ho.b/- for a 'permit to travel' (vide the Schedule to the 'Iraq Passport Law) plus to.5/- for a departure visa, and affixes 'Iraq revenue stamps. Thus although the passports themselves are supplied by his ■j . sty's overnment, no revenue accrues to his Majesty's Government for their issue. In other particulars, owing to the stamp difficulty and hie indefinite statue, the Administrative inspector is unable to oonply strictly with the British regulations for passport work. As you ax'e iwaxe (vide correspondence ending with your despatch Confidential A* dated the 11th of January, 1926) recently6* recently a doubt was even expressed as to whether he oould properly be supplied with circular instructions issued by the London Passport, Office* tfith the appointment of a British Consul at Basr&amp;h, passports would of course be issued to British subjects in proper iorm with British Consular stamps, but the revenue accruing therefrom does not appear likely to exceed Hs*1,000/- per annum. A more important result from a revenue point of view would be that the Consul would take over all British passport work including that now done by •Iraq Passport Control, viz. the grant of visas for British territory to foreigners, in your despatch “Confidential A* dated the 11th of January, 1^28, you enquired the reason why the grant of visas at naghdad enabling travellers to enter British territory should not now be undertaken by the British Consular Officer in my Secretariat, ihis matter is one which had already engaged mf attention, particularly since the issue of the new regulations requiring British subjects desiring to enter this country to pay for visas for ’Iraq. ’Iraqis can still obtain visas for British territory from the ’Iraq Passport Bureaux in ’Iraq without charge, it appears from figures supplied by these Bureaux that 4,577 such visas were granted in Baghdad during the year ended the 50th of September, 1927, and 1,072 at Basrah, in Bagiidad the transfer of tne work to my Secretariat would probably entail the engagement of extra clerical staff here or the retention of the staff whioh would otherwise be reduced on the transfer of Levy work to Air headquarters; but, with that proviso, rry Secretariat would, i consider, ue able to undertake it. The continued insistance by the 'Iraq authorities on the departure7. departure yiea with a fee of He.5/- presents some difficulty to the proposal, for it cannot be denied that* with the addition of British Consular yisas, passport fees for travellers (other than British) from ’Iraq, who have hitherto obtained the British visa and the visa departurejfor the total sum of ns. 5/-, which is the actual charge for the departure visa alone, would be abnormally high, further it is not unlikely that, by way of retaliation for the extra expense caused to 1 Iraqis visiting British territory, the 'Iraq authorities would decide to insist on all British subjects paying for departure visas, in practice, however, 1 am inclined to the vi* that the innovation would tend to hasten the abolition of the ’Iraq departure visa as is desired by His Majesty’s Government. The real obstacle which has hitherto deterred any move towards a change of the procedure as regards the grant in 'Iraq of visas for British territory is the absence of a British Consul at Basrah, or of any official there authorised to use British Consular seal and stamps, for this prevents the establishment of a uniform system for the grant of British visas throughout the countiy. A considerable number of 'Iraqis and other foreigners leave oasrah annually by sea for British territory, especially India, who do not visit Baghdad, and for whom it would be most inconvenient to be required to apply to my Secretariat at Baghdad for their British visas. 1 think it may be assumed that of the 5,649 visas granted at Baghdad and Basrah by the 'Iraq Passport bureaux during the year ended the 30th of September, 1927, at least a quarter were ordinary visas good for one year and not transit visas. In my despatch Ho. 168 dated the 7th of February, 1924, quoted above, in which it was assumed that 'Iraqis would not have to pay for British visas in ’Iraq, 1 estimated that one-eighth of8 . ot the total numoor of visas granted to other foreigners would be ordinary visas granted at full rates, the remainder being transit visas: 1 am inclined however uo jiiink that this may have been an under* estimate and indeed that the proportion of one quarter of the total now adopted may be unduly low. However with this proportion, and assuming the same visa was not is: ued any one person mos than once during the year, it follows - : s a sum of hs. 10,3/8'b-0 would have been collected in consular fees for British visas, had the visas been given in a regular manner at the present rates of ns.SrorO for an ordinary visa and Ann«n n f or a transit visa, with the appointment of a British Consul at Basrah a uniform system for the grant of visas could ne instituted throughout 'Iraq and this revenue could be collected ion nritish lands, it is true that a certain numoer oi visas lor nritish territory are now granted by tne 'Iraq Passport Bureau at Mosul but in the year ending September, 1927, for which figures were obtained ihere were only 86 of these. 1 do not consider that any great hardship would be caused to travellers from Mosul if facilities for obtaining British visas in that town were abolished. Chose leaving 'Iraq by sea or air could obtain their bntish visas in Baghdad or Basrah. Those leaving by land could ootain visas from one of the British Consular Officers in Syria. 6. It is laid down in British Consular instructions that a card index stiould be kept in eveiy Consulate of all resident nritish suojects and protected persons, i have recently received from the foreign Office ( T ide Poreign Office Circular Mo.T.13339/27/376 dated the 1st of becemoer, 1927) printed notices reminding British subjeds of tne advantages of such registration and of the desirability9. desir-ioility ot jaotityiug at Consulate a all obaoges of addresses. In this country registration was compulsory for British residents under the capitulatory regime! since the war no instructions have been given for its resumption and the necessary paraphernalia have not been ^ ixe As in the case ot the passport visa question referred to in paragraph 5 aoove, the matter has been considered out no action has been taken because of tae difficulties of registering &gt;a»rah residents in proper form under tne existing conditions. With the appointraent oi a Consul at nasrah registration would be carried out at each place in the usual manner. dhi» matter is of special importance to the considerable Indian population who (as explained in the letter to the Government of India forwarded with my despatch «o.35 dated the 7th of January, 1928) now feel the need of such registration in view of the intricacies of the Nationality Law and the rumours of conscription. V. The present procedure whertioy applications for the Consular registration of British births and deaths at Basrah are forwarded to ny Secretariat through the Administrative inspector at oaerah is slow and unsatisfactory, it would oe preferable if Basrah residents could be enabled to register births and deaths and ootain certificates in their own town. The pen ormnee oi consular notarial duties at ^±^o requires regularisation.. Although specimens of tne Administrative inspector’s signature nave been supplied to you (vide ny despatch Ao.590 dated tne 13th oi liay, 1926) and although 1 understand that in British law ii i? sufficient lor the purpose of the administration oi oatns and affirmations for the administering officer to dorive10 . derive hie authority from a Britieh source, yet no ofticial autnority to perform such services has ever been given to tne Administrative inspector and his poser to do so appears to remain a matter of doubt. Whenever possiole persons in 'Iraq desiring the servioes of a oitieial with notarial powers are advised to present themselves to ny Secretariat in Baghdad. This is pit.:ulariy inconvenient in connection with the service ii‘ ^asran oi a writ or summons emanating from a British cour “ ^ a uoh as that forming the subject of your despatch ■ o.l dated the 2nd of January, 1928). further,at the present time, the Administrative inspector authenticates for use abroad a number of legal and other documents given by 'Iraq Government officials, the local notaries public and the like. For these a British consular fee of nine shillings and sixpence is normally due and this is lost to British revenues* iae oft ice staff of the Administrative Inspector Basrah is iiow entirely 1 Iraqi* He is no longer permitted a British confidential clerk by the Uraq Groverninient* Phis will no doubt tend to increase the difficulty of differentiating between his work as a servant oi the ^raq Government and his work as the official in charge of Britieh interests. 10* In view of the above considerations 1 desire again to recommend the appointment of a British Consul at Basrah* In the event, however, of a decision being given by iiis Majesty * 3 Government against such an appointment, or if it appears likely that there will be further prolonged delay in reaching a decision, 1 would request tiiat Sv-^ps 'My je oaken to adapt the present procedure so that the consular work of &amp; routine nature to which i have11 . have referred ia thi, despatch may be perform by the AdmuustratiTe laspector at Basrah ia * regular manner. lt btle ?iew is that the Administratis Inspector as a serrant of a Foreign OoTernment cannot be invested with any consular status, it is difficult to see how this can be done; but some of the existing anoiwdies aught be removed if the Administrative Inspector *ere authorised to use British consular seel, and stamp, and to maintain the usual consular registers, on the understanding that ne acts as the agent of the High Commissioner ^ routine matters only, and that, should British residents at Basrah desire to appeal against some action ol the 'Iraq Government, they should address their representations to the High Commieeioner and not to him. fhie scheme would probably involve the attachment to the Administrative Inspector's office of a special British consular clerk the cost of whom would be covered by the receipts. It would also. 1 think, necessitate, for the reasons indicated in paragraph 4 above, that the Assistant Pert Officer at Abadan, who now oolleets British shipping fees tnero, should continue to do so, using British consular stamps and crediting the proceeds through the Port Director to the Administrative inspector's consular account. I will submit detailed proposals if desired to do so.

A Consul responsible for British interests would be in a Better position to give an impartial opinion, and this would not only bo helpful to His Hxoellency the High Commissioner but to British Trade generally.'

Besides, the British India Steam Navigation Co., the Striok Line and the Ellerman &amp; Bucknall, are the three principal British Steamship Companies and have their principal agencies at Basrah. The Kuphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company Limited, whose vessels trade between Basrah and Baghdad, have also most of their work centre! in Basrah. Practically, all importatioiBof cargo into ’Iraq have to be passed through the Custom at Basrah. The British traders in Basrah have every reason to ue dissatisfied with the present arrangement, whereby the Administrative inspector is in charge of Consular duties. s»e require so ae one with whom we can frankly consult&lt;§&gt; 5. consult and :iaou«8 mat ters, and 1 can assure you that this is only possible at present in a few oases, as we are not prepared to lay before the Administratife In.'pectoi ir.t ormation which we know, if used from an Araqian point oi‘ riew, would be prejudicial to British interests. Some Britishers, after entering the Iraqian service, become more iraqian than the Iraqis themselves. - is loyalty to their adopted service is most praise worthy, but at the same time it may also be very harmful to Britishers and their interests. To these officials oritisners are looked upon as forei^iers, which of course they are. J/ith the present tendency of giving the • Iraqis more control, the efficiency of the Government and courts is not so high as it was when all important posts were held by British officials, in consequence British traders are experiencing more difficulties, and require more assistance and protection: this we could always obtain from a British Consul. All fully appreciate the difficulties of the Administrative inspector, being a servant of the iraqian Government, acting in a Consuiar capacity, as there trust be times when the interests of the 'Iraq Governomnt clash witn British interests, it is his duty and first consileration to support Iraqi interests and on such occasions unfortunately British interest must suffer. it is generally felt that the central administration of the 'Iraq Government does not appreciate the importance of nasrah to the country, and both Britishers and Arabs consider the interests of Basrah are overlooked in favour of eg triad. lithWith a Britiah Consul here, the Hj g h Commissioner would be kept fully au fait regarding British trade, its interests and requirements, which we feel cannot bo done at present, kren if the Administratise inspector had the time to give British interests sufficient attention, we feel that being an Iranian official he does not and cannot support us as would a British Consul. Further, Irnqian officials hate not the training and experience necessary, and some not the personal qualifications of British Consuls we had in pre-war days. 1 would mention that at present the Administratiro Inspector has no British Assistant, and has a teiy large district to supertise. and from what 1 hate heard it is as much, or perhaps more than he can do to cope with it. an tine goes on and the iraqians base more coutrcl 01 their country, we can foresee that British traders will require to a greater extent a Consul to look after their interests. his Britannic Majesty's Government own their own property at Basrah.

They no longer press their objections to a contribution to the Basrah Consulate on grounds^of principle; but they object to introducing the moiety system, feeling that it is wrong in principle and may be extended indefinitely. They refer also to its drawbacks in practice. But it was on account of its practical simplicity and only as a temporary measure that it was suggested by the Secretary of State. It would be very difficult to determine with a near approach to exactness what the division of expenditure ought to be. The volume of trade with India and with the United Kingdom cannot be the sole criterion, otherwise (the proportion being roughly l:2-§-) India’s share might be assessed at two-sevenths. But the Indian population at Basrah is much larger than the European, and Indian interests might in consequence take up more than half of the Consul’s time. There is some substance too in the objection that the moiety division may be extended indefinitely. It may continue indefinitely at Basrah, for the question of liability for expenditure in Persia is still far from settlement and there are objections to complicating it still further by linking the Basrah question with it. And the introduction of the moiety division at Basrah may encourage its application at other places where India’s interests may in fact be rather less than those of His Majesty’s Government yet not susceptible • • • ofof accurate assessment. Is the Secretary of State prepared to override the Government of India’s objections and to offer to accept half of the Basrah expenditure, on the grounds of practical convenience' and as a temporary measure to be reconsidered either after a specified period or in the light of whatever decision is reached on the Persian question? The Government of India press the alternative of the appointment of an Indian representative. We in turn might raise the objection of the ’’possibility of indefinite extension’’ of this policy, but to do so would savour of a 'Diehard” attitude towards the development of India’s responsibilities and powers as a 'Dominion'. Payment of a contribution would be a simpler and more satisfactory solution of the question, but there can hardly be much practical objection to the alternative course, and it may be felt undesirable to reject this reiterated proposal of the Government of India. If it is decided to adopt the alternative of the appointment of an Indian representative, the manner of making the offer to the Foreign Office will require some consideration as the objections of the (government of India to a money contribution will have to be stated in a convincing form.

This Department adheres to the view expressed at length in Mr .Robinson’s note of 13th November, 1924, that the proposal that India should bear half the cost of the consulate at Basra is a reasonable one and should be accepted. If, however, the Government of India are influenced by political considerations to insist upon an arrangement possibly ipore expensive and less this Department does not wish to press its view further. On the question of tactics would it not be desirable simply to inform the Eoreig n Office of the Government of India’s preference and to reserve the arguments, such as they are, by which they support that preference for the reply to the inevitable protest by the Foreign Office?

It would not he difficult to provide against dangers in this direction; hut the argument - which is essentially a financial one - seems to he brought out rather perfunctorily to clear the way for the Government of India’s alternative proposal, which goes deeper than merely financial considerations. Unless there is some practical reason for or advantage in it, which so far as appears at present is not the case, the alternative of providing their own representative,irrespective of cost, is hased on no principle hut that of separatism pure and simple, and seems to me therefore to raise more serious issues than would a mere refusal to contribute to the cost of the Consulate unless and until the principle of such contributions is accepted by other parts of the Empire. I venture to suggest that the Government of India’s proposal should not he endorsed without careful consideration of its implications; and that, having regard to those implications, it would he better either to make a contribution to the cost of a unified Consulate or to refuse outright. 2z.viliol Draft Paper. ^ Department iaars office s'Zzelt^- WHITEHALL, S.W.l THE UNDER SECRETARY OP STATE, Sir, FOREIGN OFFICE I am directed by the Secretary of Stete for India in Council to refer to your letter of the 26th April, 1924, No.K.4258/ 4258/250, on the subject of the proposed re-establishment of a Consulate at Basra.

The state of those relations is so difficult to c.efine that it has prohahly 'been thought hitherto undesirable if not impossible to invite the Dominions to share the burden of British Consular expenditure. There are indicat ions that if and when the subject is opened the Dominions will favour a course similar to that already adopted in defence masters. They will prefer to have their own consular representation just as Canada and Australia have already formed the core of a Canadian and an Australian J navy. The self-esteem of the Dominions in this as in J ^ otner matters will lead them to accelerate the disintegration - ^ u 0 Empire or at any rate to increase the already growing difficulty oi maintaining its political unity, perhaps I ^ ^ or ^■ lri ^ s ver y reason that the question of consular i &gt;expenditure has not hitherto been raised.

And the Irish Free State—. h„ ^M^LX , h . h . In regard to Basrah only it appears to me reasonable to expect India to bear a share - say one-third or two-fifths - of the cost of a British consulate there. Indo-Iraq trade in the last three yars reached a value of 6 i millions sterling, - while United Kingdom-Iraq trade was 16£ millions. The number of Indians at Basrah is 4Q0 approximately, against 200 other British Subjects. It is obvious that at least a third of the Consults work will be taken up with purely Indian matters. But the Government t&gt;t/| C*, ^ a.. tf, c.JL of T ^ ru Aj- ^ U zAl C A: U J ^ dU c » j- l ‘ J a ^ . j . ,, /&gt; , ■ * / n , l hrtui.of India assert that any contribution from Indian revenues would be contrary to the spirit of the resolution of the ^ Economic Conference quoted above. I am not sure that the Government of India are not importing into this resolution a signification which it was never intended to bear. By the resolution the Conference welcomed the arrangement proposed by His Majesty’s Government whereby the Governments of the Dominions and India may utilise direct the services of Commercial Diplomatic Officers (or, where such do not exist, of Senior Consular Officers) in the case of non-European countries - for the purpose of obtaining Commercial intelligence &amp;c., “in the same way and to the same extent as the services of His Majesty’s Trade Commissioners within the Empire are already at their disposal.^ Sir P. Lloyd-Greame explained that ’’the principle His Majesty’s Government had in mind was the principle of mutuality”, i.e. that the above privileges should be available in return for the use by oreat Britain of the services of Dominion Trade Commissioners and Commercial representatives where these exist. I cannot believe that His Majesty’s Government intended to imply that they would continue to maintain existing Consulates and establish new ones entirely at their own expense even in those cases where a large part of the consular work was I do not think carried out on behalf of the Subjects of a Dominion or he argument is asound? The India. But I presume it is for the Foreign Office, ractice of the sst of the n °t India Office, to point this out, and we must rest topire may be, tit I do not see our case on the argument ( intrinsically unsound as it seems hy India should ^ 8 content to to me ) that it is not the practice for the Dominions tibscribe for oint purposes to contribute towards the upkeep of British consulates and hen other parts * f the Empire the sanie practice should be followed in the case of India. 0 n °t.

For your observations. I should he glad to learn whether the E. &amp; o. Secretary shares the Government of India's view regarding the 'spirit' of the Imperial Economic Conference Resolution. (Sd) L.D. WAKSLY. 25.8.24. I agree that the resolution of the Imperial Economic Conference does not seem to have much hearing on the question who should pay for consular services. Cannot the fact that India pays for, or contributes towards, some posts (Kashgar, Persia, Tenguyah, the Incian Vice-Consul at Jeddah) he justified on the ground tnau they exist entirely or almost entirely in Indian interests? B u t for India, His Majesty’s Government might not consider that other British interests justify the maintenance of some of these posts? Whereas there are probably no consular posts which it would not be worth while to maintain except in the interests of some one of the Dominions. But the posts which India maintains or helps uo maintain presumably serve her political interests or some special Indian interest (as in the case of Jeddah) - cf. paragraph 6 of the Government of India’s despatch of 10th July 1924 - and the question of such posts does not, therefore, appear to be analogous to that of consulates which are required on commercial grounds i.e. in the interests of British5. S’.4536. British trade as a whole. There seems to he no reason why India should contribute, any more than the Dominions, to the upkeep of such consulates. In connexion with the principle of direct Indian representation for which the Government of India express a preference in the last paragraph of their telegram, the attached papers (I0.1032/22) may be of some interest. The Foreign Office would perhaps object to such direct representation in a foreign country except by an officer subordinate (like the Vice Consul at Jeddah) to the Foreign Office representative or by some one like an Agent under paragraph 7 of the Emigration Act who would not have access to the Government of the country inwhich he was stationed except through the Foreign Office representative. The functions of the Agents under the Emigration Act are to protect Indian Emigrants and are not otherwise commercial. (Sd.) J.C. Walton. 2.9.1924. I agree generally with Mr.Walton, but it seems desirable to address the Foreign Office on the lines of the Government of India telegram of 13th August, leaving them to find the answer to it. If the Government of India persist in their present attitude, it will, I imagine, be thought good policy to give in to them. (Sd.) E.J. Turner. Ycf.X' t f 4 l y Secretary, Political Department. In view of the extent and importance of the Indian interests involved there seems to me to be difficulty in refusing to share the cost of the proposed consulate at Basra. If the consulate were one already in existence towardstowards which India had hitherto contributed nothing the argument from the Resolution of the Economic Conference would have more force, but the case is one of the revival of a consulate the whole cost of which was borne by India the before the war -/contribution of £1400 paid by this Office to the Foreign Office before and after the settlement following the Welby Commission being intended to recoup that Department completely for its expenditure at Basra. The Resolution of the Economic Conference contemplated give and take arrangements and can hardly have been intended to suggest that a Dominion should decline to contribute a share of the cost where its interests involved were so important as in the present case. The historical position has a bearing, I think, on the question at issue:- (1) Before the Welby Commission settlement India ran the whole of the diplomatic and consular establishments in Turkish Arabia, with the exception of the Consulate at Basra, which was run by the Foreign Office, but paid for by India. The A g enc y Basra was paid for direct by India. The expenditure amounted in all (taking ls.4d to the rupee) to about £7,500 a year (see Statement 'A” attached), while the Budget for 1895-6, the figures in which were the latest placed before the Welby Commission, provided over £4,000 in addition for a Consulate house at Basra. ( 2 ) Under the settlement following the report of the Commission this expenditure, with the exception of the cost of the Basra consulate was nooled with our expenditure in Persia for the purpose of the half and half division recommended by the Commission, so that in e ffect from 1900 uo to the Great War we and the Foreign Office shared the cost in moieties, except in the case of the I Basra Consulate , the full cost of which India I still continued to pay. (I doubt whether this exception was deliberate. It was due simply, I Imagine, to accidental separation of the' figures).

Moreover Iraq is now costing India nothing, while it still costs the United Kingdom a good deal (the estimate for 1924-5 is £4,713,000, Statement The proposal that we should share the cost of the proposed Basra consulate, which will obviously be helpful to India, seems therefore on the merits a very reasonable one, and prima facie it would seem unreasonable of India to refuse. This reasoning does not apply to India’s second suggestion, viz. that she should have a representative of her own, and perhaps this would be the most acceptable solution to her, though the cost, if a consular representative on the ordinary India scale were appointed, would probable be much higher, as the Government8. Government of India no doubt recognize, than if she were to share the cost of a Foreign Office consul. I suppose the views of the Government of India must be laid before the F 0 reign Office, but the telegram is not a very convincing document, and I assume that its proposals would be restated by the Secretary of State in Council. The question of India’s contribution towards diplomatic and consular expenditure in China had better I think, be treated separately from that of the proposed consulate at Basra, The Government of India argue in effect that India has little or no interest now- in the diplomatic and consular establishments in China, but they do not take this line in regard to the Basra appointment. If you agree that the cases should be treated separately you will perhaps think it desirable to ask the Department of Economics and Industry to examine the arguments of the Government of India in regard to our trade with China, and to let me see the papers again, with an expression of your own views as to the political questions involvod. I am sorry that my reply to your reference has been delayed by urgent work in connection with the V/ar Office. ( s d. ) W.Robinson. 13th November, 1924. The file regarding the Indian Contribution to Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in China will be submitted separately; it was referred along with the present one because of the similarity in the standpoint taken by the Government of India. A copy of their despatch on the China expenditure is placed on this filefile for reference From the above notes it will be seen that India paid the whole cost of the Basrah consulate in 1900; but the political interest formerly held by India in Basra and Mesopotamia which may have justified such a contribution has passed, in consequence of the War, to His Majesty’s Government, and any argument for renewing the contribution (to whatever extent) ipust rest on the value of Indian commerce with Iraq and on the number of Indians living in and passing through Basrah, thfese being the factors which make the Consulate desirable from the Indian point of view. It is impossible, from the published statistics, to get a definite idea of the comparative values of Indo-Iraq and United Kingdom - Iraq trade before the war; we cannot, therefore, safely say whether there is, on commercial grounds, a less (or a greater) case for an Indian Contribution than i there was before the war. A draft to the Foreign Office, on the lines of the Government of India’s telegram, is submitted, leaving it to them (as Mr.Turner suggests) to find the answer. The draft omits the Government of India’s alternative to a contribution (as Indian Vice-Consul or Agent ); this would more suitably be introduced in any reply that may be made to the expected Foreign Office protest at our blank refusal to contribute.'P 4 ? T k / 2 ^t ' fAW CcrJjjtu- . So/'/ 11 ' The Political Conmittee consider that a distinction can he drawn between the Chinese Consulates and the Basrah Consulate on the question of a contribution from Indian Revenues. They would support the Government of India's view that the Indian contribution of £12,500 towards Consular expenditure in China should be discontinued. But they are of opinion that^in view of the extent of Indian interests at Basrah and in the Persian Gulf area generally and of the fact that up to 1914 the full cost of the Basrah Consulate was borne by India, a contribution towards the cost of the Consulate there would as a special case be justified. They consider that the rule at present followed in the division of liability for expenditure at Koweit and for Diplomatic and Consular expenditure in Persia should for the time being be applied (for the sake of convenience and uniformity) to the BasrahBasrah Consulate i.e. that India should Dear half the cost. Division of the cost for the future should he considered in connection with the discussions now in progress on the division of expenditure in Persia. 30 JAN 1925Draft Paper.

Sir I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to refer to your letter of the 26th Anril, No.K.4258/4258/ 250, on the subject of the nronosed re-establishment of a consulate at Basrah The Secretary of State has now received the views of the Government of India uron the suggestion conveyed in your letter that the contribution formerly raid by this office towards the cost of the Basrah Consulate might be revived in the event of approval being given to the arrointment of a consular officer there. The Government of India recognise that consular representation at Basrah is desirable on commercial grounds. years theyalue of trade in the latter jzase amounted to 2i times the ^alue of Indo-Iraq trade; and this consideration, together with thethe f^ct that the political/ situation in Basrah and/raq has entirely altered si/e 1914, renders it imno^ihle to consider a renewal o/the Indian contribution on the pre-war scale/ / • t /' The Government of India, 4^w£3£&amp;r^j express their 1 opinion that they should not be asked to make any contribution to the revived consulate unless the Dominion governments are similarly invited to share in British consu] expenditure. They point out that in no case, so far as they are aware, has a Dominion or Colony been required to contribute to the cost of British diplomatic and consular establishments in foreign countries; and in their view a contribution such as it is now suggested they should make would be contrary to the spirit of Resolution 4 (A) (i) of the Imperial Economic Conference of 1923, which recorded the offer of His Majesty’s Government to place the services of their Commercial Diplomatic Officers at tne disposal of the Dominions and of India.

You will, I think, find that the matter has been raised officially with you by the Foreign Office tinder their reference number K:/ll 355 , but that the project is now held up by the (Jovemment of India, who are being asked, at the suggestion of the Treasury, to contribute towards the \ cost of the Basrah post. What Sir Arnold says about the supply of commercial intelligence from ’Iraq is only too true. The position is that we are sure (a) from our own experience. ^ Monteath, Esq., O.B.E., (b) /(b) from the admission of the High Commissioner' Secretariat at Baghdad, (c) from complaints of local British Chambers, * * (d) from complaints of British manufacturers, that the supply of commercial intelligence from that country is entirely unsatisfactory. We are equally sure,-and the Consular Department are at one with us - that it can only be improved by om having a full time Consul under our direct supervision, so far as commercial matters are concerned. Every possible alternative to this has been examined, and found impossible. My chiefs, therefore, are extremely anxious that all possible steps to secure a favourable and early reply from the (Jovernment of India should be ? * * taken as soon as possible. Could you help ? t Sir Arnold Wilson's remarks on Palestine - from which the flow of information is a little better - ar e of course not germane to the present issue* I leave them in his letter merely to keep entire his general opinion, and it should not be assumed that we agree witf them/-3- them in to to.

It was not sent onto me from the Club and I only got it two days ugo• I am off on the 6 th to Buenos Aires and shall not be back till May. So I will give you my views in writing for what they are worth though I am only too well aware that a short verbal conversation would make it unnecessary for me to write much of what follows as you are no doubt aware of it. I begin by enunciating the principle that in foreign countries British Consular Officers are generally speaking the proper agency for (l) the collection of trade statistics and for ( 2 ) the collection and prompt transmission of commercial intelligence. As regards (1) you are, or can be, reasonably well served in Iraq and Palestine by the existing Administrations and by external private agencies e.g. the Iraq Year Book, which might well be subsidised with a view to issue in an improved form annually. As regards (2) commercial intelligence, you are not assisted as you should be by the existing Administrations and it is desirable that you should have your own man on the spot. So far as Iraq is concerned this can best be done in my view by having a whole time Consul de carriers at Basrah - as there was before the war. The post is at present in abeyance but the duties are performed by the Administration Inspector at Basrah in addition to his own. A Consular office and residence is available (now occupied by the Administrative Inspector). The Covemment of India formerly contributed £900 a year towards the Consulate (see Welby Commission report 1900 and Inchcape Report 1922) and have only ceased to do so since 1917 when they discovered that there was no Consulate. No one is necessary at Baghdad provided that the Consul is permitted, and encouraged, to visit Baghdad frequently and to stay there for 10 days or so at a time -■ i.e. he must have a good clerk who can run all routine in his absence. As regards Palestine I do not know enough to be able to say much but obviously the problem is of less importance than in Iraq as the population is less than 800,000, I believe, as against 2-^ million in Iraq. British trade too is on a smaller proportion to the total than in Iraq and there is no transit trade. I am inclined to think that your best course would be to include Palestine within the commercial sphere of your organisation in Egypt; the latter should be furnished with mil official information by the Palestine Covemment and all its Departments, direct, and a representative from Egypt (or alternatively from London) should visit Palestine twice a year- spending/spending a fortnight or three weeks touring the largest centres. Here, too, it is quite possible that with a little encouragement or a small subsidy some private show like the 'Palestine Hews' might be roped in to do something in the way of answering enquiries, putting advertisers or enquirers in touch with buyers or sellers, etc., and printing fairly up'to date data re trade• If the Colonial Office were to hand over the responsi bility for Iraq and Palestine and Arabia (which should never have been vested in the C.O.) to the Foreign Office, as I hope they will before long, you would no doubt have less difficulty. Probably the influence of the Crown Agents is responsible for some of the difficulties and embarrassments of the present regime • With my sincere apologies for an inadequate scrawl (please type it before it goes on the file 1 .)

Subject. — India's contribution towards the cost of Diplomatic and Consular represen tation in China, My Lord, In Mr. Makely’s letter No. 38 of 20th September 1923 the Government of India were asked for their views on the proposal made by the Foreign Office that the contribution of £12,500 per annum made'by India at present towards the cost of Diplomatic and Consular representation in China should be increased to £20,000 per annum. We have carefully examined the question and have come to the conclusion that there is no justification now for any contribution. We state below the reasons for our view and trust that Your Lordship will be able to induce the Foreign Office and H. M.’s Treasury to agree to its cessation. 2. The only argument for the continuance of this contribution is the historical one, viz. , that India has made such a contribution for 90 years. Before 1834, the expenses of ^he Consular establishment in China were not a direct charge on Govern ment revenues (either British or Indian) but were recovered by means of a duty imposed on all British tonnage and goods entering Chinese ports. These expenses were thrown on the general funds of the Empire in 1834, when it.was decided that they should be divided between India and Great Britain in the ratio of 1*2. Apparently the East India Company’s monopoly of British trade with China led to the decision that a share should be paid by the Company. 3. This payment has come under discussion from time to time since then and the Government of India and the Secretary of State have made many protests against it. After some time the proportionate rate was given up and a fixed sum paid which was originally £15,000 but was reduced to £12,500 per annum in 1890. This latter sum was originally fixed only for 10 years, but the Welby Commission recommended its continuance, on the ground chiefly that India was dependent for a considerable proportion of her revenue on the opium trade with China, and the amount has persisted since then. Owing to the fact that it was not shown sepa rately in the accounts but was merged in the various transactions between H. M.’s Treasury and India, the fact of the payment appears to have been overlooked and we are grateful to the Foreign Office for raising the point now and enabling us to reconsider the whole question. 4. The brief historical summary given above shows, we hope clearly, that the contribution is an anachronism based on two considerations which no longer exist, viz., the old East India Company’s monopoly of British trade with China and the opium traffic with China. As we have already stated, the charge was originally in substitution of a duty levied on all British ships entering Cninese ports where British Superintendents were stationed. It might have been proper to make a trading corporation like the East India Company pay the charge, but we submit, MSSFinDit is hardly correct to impose it on the Indian taxpayer. It appears all the Ihss equitable when it is seen that it is the carrying trade, so largely in British hands, rather than the Indian producer, that requires the protection and assistance of the British diplomatic and consular officers in China, and the direct commercial assist ance or intelligence that India receives from them is very slight and has been so since the final extinction of the opium trade. 5. We must also point out that the levy of such a charge seems to be contrary to the general practice of the British Empire. In no case, so far as we know, has a Dominion or Colony been required to contribute*to the cost of British diplomatic and consular establishments in foreign countries and, if we may make a comparison, India’s interest in China is surely not stronger than Canada’s in the United States of America. Moreover, the levy of a charge of this sort appears to be contrary to the spirit of Resolution 4 (A) (i) of the Imperial Conference, 1923, in accordance with which the services of H. M.'s Commercial diplomatic officers in foreign countries are placed at the disposal of the Governments of the Dominions and India. 6. So much for our commercial interests in China; as for political interests, it is no exaggeration to say that they are confined to Chinese Turkestan, the Burma frontier, and in a more remote degree, to the Inner Tibetan frontier. But these special interests are, we think, not inadequately met by our upkeep of the Kashgar Consulate General and our contribution to the Tenguyeh Consulate. We have no voice whatever in shaping policy in China (except in the particular case of Tibet on which account we maintain at our own expense a considerable staff) and we cannot doubt that if the question of our financial liability were to be decided dis passionately on its merits, the decision would surely be that India’s liability is no- more than that of any one of the Dominions. We have the honour to be, My Lord Your Lordship’s most obedient, humble Servants, (Signed) READING. „ RAWLINSON. „ MUHAMMAD SHAFT „ B. N. SARMA. „ C. A. INNES. „ BASIL P. BLACKETT. „ A. P.

India Office to Treasury. F. 3418. 17th July 1900. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to draw the attention of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury to the proposals of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure, regarding the apportionment of charge between the Governments of the United kingdom and of India for purposes in which both are interested. According to paragraph 364 of the Report of the Commission, the total amount of the annual charges to be transferred from the revenues of India to those of the United Kingdom would be approximately 293,000/. ; hut this includes a sum of 108,000/. sterling as one half of the military charges for Aden, which should have been stated as 108,000 tens of rupees, so that a reduction of 36,000/. must be made. The total amount of the relief which India would receive, if all the recommendations of the Commission were adopted, would therefore be, not 293.000/., but 257,000/. a year. I am desired to express Lord George Hamilton’s confident hope that the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury will accept the unanimous opinion of the Commission, in so far as it is in favour of relieving the revenues of India to that extent. As regard* the heads under which the relief should be given, I am directed to make the following suggestions. It appears to Lord George Hamilton that this opportunity might with advantage be taken to put an end to certain minor payments that are now made bv India, and thus to simplify the accounts between the two Governments. At present the iSecretarv of State in Council pays 7,000/. a year on account of the Mission to the Court of Persia, 12,600/. a year for Her Majesty’s Establishments in China, and 1,787/. as contributions towards the expenses of the Jeddah, Momein, and Busreh Consulates, making a total of 21,287/. for political charges. He also pays a subsidy of 10,000/. a year to the Eastern Telegraph Company on account of the Zanzibar-Mauritius cable. I am to suggest that for the future all these contributions might be foregone by the Imperial Government. His Lordship assumes that 130,000/. will be allowed as half the cost of the transport of troops to and from India, and will be defrayed by the Imperial Government, in accordance with the proposals of the Commission. With respect to the Military Charges for Aden, Lord George Hamilton desires me to suggest that the sum to be granted from Imperial revenues might equitably be fixed at 100,000/. a year, being slightly in excess of the share which the Commissioners considered that the Imperial Government should bear, but on the other hand somewhat less than the sum (108,000/.) by which they apparenily intended that India should benefit under this head. If these suggestions are accepted by the Lords Commissioners, the total amount of £ relief to be received by India will be ♦Political charges - - 21,287 261,287/.* a year, and Lord George Hamilton Telegraph subsidy Transport, moiety Share of Aden expenses is prepared to accept that sum as satisfying oo’ooo r ^ e suitable claims of India under existing ! circumstances in respect of the subjects re- Total - £261,287 ferred to the Royal Commission.

The waiver by the Imperial Government of certain minor payments now made annually by India:— 1. Subsidy to the Eastern Telegraph Company on account of the Zanzibar-Mauritius Cable - 2. Persian Mission - 3. Establishments in China - - - 4. Consulates at Jeddah, Momein, and Basra £ £ 28,000 10,000 7,ooo 12,500 1,787 31,287 Total 59,287 This sum, together with 72,000/. representing half the military charges for Aden and 130,000/. representing half the cost of transport of troops, makes up a total of 261,287/., as compared with the 25/ .000/. recommended by the Royal Commission, beyond which my Lords are not prepared to increase materially the contribution from Imperial Funds. With reference to the above proposals, the Secretary of State for Whr informs my Lords that he is prepared to make an annual contribution from Army Funds, towards the cost of the transport of troops and towards the military charges for Aden, of 230,000/., to commence as from 1st April 1901. His Lordship, however, points out that the Royal Commission recommended that the capitation rate, which forms the basis of the contri bution paid by India for Home Effective Charges, should be revised in five or six years, and he proposes therefore that the contribution of 230,000/. should remain in force for a similar period. My Lords concur in this proposal. There remains to be considered the suggestion that the Imperial Government should forego the payments now made by India to the extent of 31,287/. per annum, as set out above. My Lords fully share the opinion of the Secretary of State in Council that it is desirable to take the opportunity of putting an end to these payments, so far as circum stances justify, with a view to simplifying to that extent the accounts between the two Governments; and, for their part, they readily agree to give up the Indian contribution of 10,000/. per annum towards the subsidy for the Zanzibar-Mauritius cable.As regards the other payments by India winch are now appropriated in aid of the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs has expressed Ids views in a letter dated the 11th ultimo, of which I am to enclose a copy. It will be seen that the Marquess of Salisbury is prepared to forego the following sums :— For establishments in China - - - - - For the Persian Mission (the sum recommended by the Royal Commission) - £ 12.500 5,000 17.500 2,000/. per annum would thus continue to be payable by India in respect of the Persian Mission. The Foreign Office letter points out that 1,787/- does not correctly represent the existing contributions for Jeddah, Momein, and Basra Consulates, which should be 2,664/. per annum, and suggests that India should continue to pay a lump sum of 6,000/. (to include the remaining 2,000/. in respect of the Persian Mission, and the present con tributions (a) for the Consulates at Jeddah, Momein, and Basra, and (b) for the Consulates at Kerman and Chiengmai). My Lords concur in this suggestion, which would have the result of making the total concession to India about 500/. more than the 257,000/. per annum recommended by the Royal Commission. My Lords trust that the Secretary of State in Council will be able to accept the above proposals as satisfying the equitable claims of India, under existing circumstances, in respect of the subjects referred to the Royal Commission. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) E. W. Hamilton. Enclosure in No. 5. Foreign Office to Treasury. llth August 1900. The Marquess of Salisbury has given careful consideration to your letter of the 26th ultimo, and to the proposals of the Secretary of State for India with regard to the withdrawal of certain contributions hitherto made from Indian funds towards Her Majesty’s Diplomatic and Consular Establishments in China, Persia, and Turkey. I am directed by his Lordship to state that, in view of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Indian Expenditure, he is prepared to accept the arrangement as modified by the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, viz., that the contribution of 12,500/. towards the establishments in China should no longer appear as an appro priation-in-aid of the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, and that the 7,000/. now furnished by India towards Imperial expenditure in Persia should be reduced by 5,000/. With regard to the payments for the maintenance of Her Majesty’s Consulates at Jeddah, Momein, and Basra, I am to observe that the sum of 1,787/- d° es not correctly represent the amounts supplied by India for that purpose. The figures appear to have been taken from the Appropriation Account for 1898-99, which, amongst other things, only included a half-year’s contribution in the case of Basra. The items now stand as follows:— For Jeddah „ Momein - „ Basra £ 790 474 (maximum) 1,400 £2,6641 am also to point out that contributions have hitherto been received from India towards the expenses of two other consulates, viz.:— For Kerman Chiengmai 400 (maximum) 1,000 1.400 Lord Salisbury entirely concurs in Lord George Hamilton’s view that it is very desirable to put an end to the minor payments which are now made by India, and thus to simplify the accounts between the two Governments, and lie gathers from the expressions contained in your letter that the Lords of the Treasury are of the same opinion. The periodical revision of these assessments gives rise to some inconvenience, and to much lengthy correspondence. If the Secretary of State is asked to forego so large a sum as 17 , 500 /. for the benefit of the Indian Exchequer, there seems to be no sufficient reason for disputing the exact figures at which the half share to be borne by India on account of each individual consulate should from time to time be fixed. Moreover, these special payments are apt to attract attention, and to give rise to adverse com ment and criticism, relating as they do to places affected by so many diverse political considera tions, and situated so far apart on the Red Sea and the Shatt-el-Arab and in remote provinces of Persia, China, and Siam. It appears to his Lordship that the desired simplification of accounts can best be effected by merging the smaller payments in one general contribution, which, however much reduced, might still be regarded as a share of the Imperial expenditure in China, Persia, and Siam. • ~ I am therefore to suggest, for their Lordships’ consideration, that the Gov eminent ot India should for the future contribute 6,000/. per annum to the Diplomatic and Consular Vote, this sum being arrived at approximately as follows:— Remnant of general contribution for Persia Existing contributions for Jeddah „ „ „ Momein - „ „ „ Basra - ,, 55 55 Kerman „ „ Chiengmai £ - 2,000 £ 790 474 1,400 2,664 400 1,000 1,400 £6,064 The total amount at present paid from Indian revenues is 23,564/., and the saving to India by reducing this sum to 6,000/. is 17,564/., as compared with 17,500/., the figure mentioned in your letter.

A discussion on some aspects of these questions took place during the preliminary consideration of the worrr lying hefore the Conference at the Second Meeting, held on the 4th October, 1923. CO-OPERATION IN RESPECT OF COMMERCIAL INTELLIGENCE. i/ith regard to commercial intelligence, the Conference had hefore them a memorandum on Co-operation between Home and Dominion Governments in respect of Commercial Intelligence, I.E.C. (23)-5 (see page 257). The Chairman pointed out that the Imperial War Conference in 1917 recommended that the services of His Majesty's Trade Commissioners should be placed at the disposal of the Governments of the Dominions and India. There had now been established a commercial diplomatic service in foreign countries, and attention had been paid to the development of the commercial side of the work of the Consular Service. It was now proposed that the services of commercial diplomatic officers, and of senior consular officers in certain countries where no commercial diplomatic officer is stationed should be made available to the Governments of the Dominions and India in the same way and to the same extent as the services of the Trade Commissioners had already been made available. The principle His Majesty's Government had in mind was the principle of mutuality, and they hoped that the services of commercial representatives of the Dominions might in the same way be made available to British/IHPEJtlAL ECONOMIC CONFEKENCE, 1923. Resolution 4 (A) (i), 4. FURTHER STEPS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF MUTUAL TRADE. ). In.pei Co-operation in respect of Commercial Intelligaice. It was decided to adopt the following Resolutions:- (i) Commercial Diplomatic and Consular Services. 'This Imperial Economic Conference takes note of the offer of His Majesty’s Government to place the services of His Majesty’s Commercial Diplomatic Offioers in foreign countries at the disposal of the Governments of the Dominions and India ani of the Colonies and Protectorates in the same way and to the same extent as the services of His Majesty’s Trade Commissioners within the Empire are already at their disposal. It not«a that Hi s Majesty's Government propose that as regards countries outside of Europe the Governments should utilise ~ direct the services of Commercial Diplomatic Officers or of senior Consular Officers where no Commercial Diplomatic Officers have been appointed.but that coMnunications which it is proposed to address to Commercial Diplomatic Officers in European countries should be transmitted in the first instance to the Department of Overseas Trade. The Conference,recognising the importance of all possible steps being taken to strengthen the mutual co-operation of the several parts of the Empire in matters of commercial intelligence with a view to the development of Empire trade,welcomes the arrangements proposed by His Majesty’s Government. 'It also welcomes the offer of the Governments of the Dominions which have appointed Trade Commissioners in countries overseas to make a similar arrangement for the utilisation of those! J those officers by Groverranents 6f other parts oi the Empire. 'The Conference further recommends that,when two or more trovernments of the Empire maintain commercial representatives in the same country,an. endeavour should he made~to arrange that the offices of these representatives should be'in the same building or in close proximity,in order to facilitate all possible co-operation between such r representatives in their work on behalf of Empire trade.** 4^'—/JrVt (2^ 3865 i.

The proposal put forward in. the Juke of Devonshire’s despatch No. 321 dated 13th April, 1923, that a resident hritish subject might be appointed as British consul, Basrah, on the basis of retention by the consul of a certain percentage of tne Consular fees has been communicated to members of the British Chambers of commerce who have given it their careful consideration. I beg-to enclose copies of letters on the subject addressed to me by the two Chambers from which it will be seen that British residents in this country are strongly of opinion that a full time British Consul should be posted to Basrah as in pre-war days. This view is supported by the Administrative Inspector who, as you are aware, is in temporary charge of British interests there. In this connection a reference is also invited to the Duke of Devonshire’s de The Right Honourable J.H.Thomas, P.C., M.P., decretory of dtate for the Colonies, Downing dtreet, London, d.W.i. No.1310ho. 1310 iated 21st December, 1923. lYom the tone of tnese letters you will appreciate tnat tne proposal has aroused considerable feeling among British residents and I regret that on tnis account I have not as yet found it possible to secure the .services of a British subject in Lasran witn tne necessary status who would be prepared to undertake the duties of Consul at that Port on the terms set by the Foreign Office. I venture therefore to sug gest the possibility of a reconsideration of the deci sion of His Majesty's Government in tnis matter. 3. The Foreign Office nas refused to entrust tiie commercial duties oi a Consular Officer to a member of tne ni^h Commissioner's stall or any consular duties to the Administrative Inspector at Basrah. This ruling, which I have no desire to question, involves the necess ity of providing an aabquate substitute to assist and protect British commercial interests, especially at nasran. It can nardiy be suggested tnat British commer cial interests in Iraq are of less moment now than they were Dei ore tne war, andat that time it was tnought necess ary to maintain a Britisn Consul at Basrah paid by the Foreign Office as well as tne British Resident and Consul General at Baghdad maintained by the Government of India. The proposal out forward by Sir Percy Cox in the last paragraph of his despatch ho. C.O. 875 dated 20th December, 1922, namely tnat the notarial consular duties at Baghdad should be performed by tne legal member of ms staff and tnat a full time Consul shouldbe maintained at Basrah to perionn the commercial intelligence side of the consular duties for tne wnole ot ’Iraq, is little more than a return to the system which was considered necessary before tne war. If, as I agree, the commercial intelligence duties of a uonsul cannot be adequately performed by an unquali fied member of my staff, I consider it of the highest importance to British commercial interests and pres tige that a properly qualified consul snouid be appointed at Basrah. 4. I have endeavoured in subsequent paragraphs of ihis letter to form some estimate as to the cost of maintaining a Consul at Basrah and the revenue which may be expected to accrue from consular fees and other receipts and it is the difficulty of arriving at this in the absence of any previous records which is the cause of tne delay in my reply on the subject. The Chambers of Commerce have based tneir contention that the lees collected would be ample to cover the salar ies oi a Consul and Staff on the erroneous assumption that passport lees would oe collected by the Consul on a scale and to an amount comparable with receipts of the 'Iraq Government from lees levied on 'Iraq depart ure visas, whicn form the subject of separate correspondence. 5. The revised estimated receipts from passport control are based on tne issue of passports at Basran during the year 1st November, 1922, to 31st October, 1923, and the fees laid down in Chapter IX of General Instructions to Consular Officers. during that period visas for British territory which should properlyproperly nave been granted oy a British Consul were granted by ’Iraq Passport officers to somewnat less tnan 8,000 non- British subjects. As the f Iraq government fee is tne same in each case, no definite distinction is drawn in tneir records oetween full and Lransit visas. It is stated However tnat very few full visas were granted ana it may be estimated tnat aoout an eightn of tne total would have been cnarg- ed at tne full visa rate. It is probable also that aoout tnree quarters of tne applicants were ‘Iraqi nationals. It has oeen suggested tnat a reciprocal arrangement mignt oe come to under which ' Iraqi nation als should oe excused from obtaining a British Consul's visa for British territory and British subjects should be excused from obtaining an Iraq endorsement of depart ure and tms proposal is about to be submitted to you. If it were accepted, tne estimated receipts would oe as foilows:- 250 full visas at 10 gold francs or Rs. 6/4/- Rs. 1562-8-0 1750 transit visas at 1 gold franc or .annas 10 New Passoorts - 95 (at7sh/6 2 ~Rs. 5/10/-) Renewals - 276 (at 2 sh- - Rs, 1/8/-) Endorsements for countries outside British Empire- 118 (at 2 sh= Rs. 1/8/- Rs. 2656-4-0 •itish Indian as follows:- Rs. 535- 0-0 Rs. 414- 0-0 Rs . o i o » 1— ( Rs. 1126- 0-0 TheThe total annual receipts on account of passports may 'therefore oe estimated at ratner less than Rs. 4,000/— In view however of tne fact tnat the present tendency is , ^ to reduce passport fees to a minimum, this sum seems likely to aiminish every'year ratner than to increase. 6. In the absence of any previous record it is still more difficult to estimate, even approximately, wnat would oe tne proceeds from otner sources laid aown by consular Instructions, The Port Director nas however .Shipping statistics.supplied tne marginalJy noted schedules, herewith enclosed 2.Total fees collected, showing particulars as to shipping ana protest fees 3.Scale of fees lev- collected during the financial year IVZZ-Zd: he is un- ied. certain what proportion of these fees would in fact have been levied by a British Consul. It will be noted hov/ever that the fees charged by the Port authorities are less, except in the case of that for noting a pro test, than those laid down in Consular Instructions. At the present time the Basrah Port authorities collect the protest and snipping lees leviable oy a British Consul at both Basrah and Abaaan and indeed the greater part of these fees is collected at the latter place. Foreign Office receipts from this source may in any case be estimated at not less than Rs. 4,000/-. 7. From other sources receipts are estimated oy the Administrative Inspector at not less tnan Rs. 500/- per annum. It will oe seen tnereiore tnat tne total receipts at Basrah cannot with any certainty be estimated at a higher figure tnan Rs.3,500/- per annum, i.e.less than £600. When8. When however a Consul is appointed and consular stamps are used and fees charged at Basrah, the system in force here of either conforming tothe 'Iraq u-overnment charges or of maicir^g no charge at all in the performance of consular duties must presumaoiy oe discontinued and the consular stamp and fee system be adopted in my i Secretariat also. If so, the stamps will necessarily be supplied by the Foreign Office to whom the fees will accrue. At Baghdad during the year 1923, between Hs. 3,500/- and Rs. 4,000/- (or if ' Iraqiaare to be in cluded, Rs. 7,000/-) would havebeen collected on account of passports by a British Consul at Baghdad, Rs. 140/- on account of marriages, about Rs. 60/- for registration and about Rs. 560/- for the authentication of documents, i.e. in all not less tnan Rs.4,500/- or £300. It is probable however that the extra passport work would involve an increase in my staff of at least one clerk. 9. as regards the cost of upKeep of the basrah Consulate, I understand tnat the emoluments of tne Consul at the outbreak of tne war amounted to £740 per annum. It appears from the Foreign Office list that the present salary of a Consul is £800-25-1000 and that he is allowed in audition a representation allowance of £250. For his staff tne following would probaoiy suffice;- 1 dragoman Rs. 200 per mensem. 2 Clerks Rs. 350 ' 2 Orderlies Rs. 80 ' M Rs. 630 per mensem. i.e. about £500 per annum.As is pointed out oy the Baghdad Chamber of Commerce in their letter enclosed, accommodation for a Consul exists in the former British Consulate buildings at Basrah waicn are now in the provisional occupation of the Administrative Inspector, Basrah, under the ’Iraq Government. A reference is invited in tnis connection to correspondence ending with Lr. Churchills despatch Mesopotamia ho. 53 dated 28th April, 1921. It appears therefore tnat tne iotai cost of tne upkeep of tne consulate would oe not less than £1600 per annum, as against possioie receipts due to tne change in system of £9UU per annum. 10. In regard to protection of interests of Portuguese subjects in tnis country wnicn formed tne suoject of Colonial Office aespa cn dated 1st Novemoer, 1923, it is difficult to maxe any suggestions until the arrangements whereby British interests in Basrah :::re to oe protected nave been definitely settled. It appears however that the nature of tne assistance desired by the Portuguese nationals is in connection with birth, death or marriage certiiicates ana tne authentication of legal documents only ana, if tnis is tne case, I see, no grave oojection, subjecu to the approval oi his Majesty’s Government, to meeting the wisnes oi tne Portuguese Government in tne manner outlined hereafter. 11. In paragraph 2 of Bir Percy Cox’s despatch Ko.C.O. 45 dated 11th hovember, 1921, it was intimated that births and deaths amongst tne British community to gether with such British marriages as are not solemn ized by the High Commissioner under the Foreign Marriages Act are registered by tne 'Iraq Health DirectorateDirectorate who submit annual returns to Somerset House. Since June 1921 facilities have also been accorded by trie Health Directorate for the registration of births, deaths and marriages among Portugese subjects for wnom special registers have oeen kept. That tne volume of worK thus involved is small is shown by the following statement of oirtns, deaths and marriages amongst Portuguese subjects registered during the year ending September 1923:- Basrah Baghdad Births 1 0 Deaths 3 3 Marriages 0 5 It is probable however that in many cases no steps are taken by the persons concerned with a view to secure registration. While I am ignorant of the procedure in these matters adopted by His Majesty’s representatives in trie Persian Gulf, I would suggest that, since it will evidently be impracticable for any form of registration of Portuguese marriages to be undertaken on the lines of the Foreign Marriages Act under which in this country ro marriage can be registered unless solemn ized in the official: residence of the Marriage Officer, it would be sufficient for the requirements of Portugese subjects if, when British registration by the Health Directorate is formally abolished, the registers wuich have already been compiled on their account oe taken over and continued in their present form by the Brtish Consuls. In the case of registration of marriages the procedure is :or tne recognisedrecognised religious authority solemnizing the marriage to supply the Registrar with a certificate that he has done so, giving the usual particulars. In the case of births and deaths registration is carried out on information supplied by. any creditable informant such as the next of kin or the medical officer in attendance. As to the authentication of legal documents, if the Portuguese Government are prepared to recognise the seals of British Consuls in 'Iraq, it will be suffi cient -for tne seal and signature of the 'Iraq Ilotary Public, before Wiiom the legal document is drawn up, to be authenticated by the Consul in the usual way. The fees laid down in Consular Instructions might be levied and British Consular stamps used. 12. It is estimated that there are some 1500 tendency Portugese nationals in this country out in view of the for Goans to call themselves Indians as the occasion serves, this estimate is necessarily untrustworthy. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, i humole servant, (Sgd) H. DOBBS High Commissioner For 'Iraq.Copy of memorandum No. B.C.C.216 dated the 31st July, 19^3, Iran the Honorary Secretary, British Chamber of Comnerce, Basrah, to the Administrative Inspector, Basrah. I have the honour to inform you that the question of the appointment of an unofficial British Resident for Basrah was placed before the members of the British Chamber of Commerce at a meeting held by them on Monday the 30th July, 1923. The members have directed me to thank you for your letter No. 2151 dated the 14th July, 1923, and to state that the Chamber is of the opinion that British Trade interests would not be sufficiently protected by an unoflicial British resident in Basrah being appointed to the rank of Trading Consular Officer. The Chamber tnerefore request that you will intimate to the parties concerned that it considers British Trade interests in Basrah are of sufficient importance to demand the appointment of a regular Foreign Office Consul. From the figures given in the Schedule attached to your letter it would appear that the fees would be sufficient to support a British Consul. The Chamber is of the opinion that this should not affect the question and the real factor should be the interests of the British Trade and the British Traders in ’Iraq.Copy. British Chamber of Commerce Baghdad. P.0, Box No. 34. Baghdad, 25th October, 1923. To H.E. The Higi Commissioner for ’Iraq, Baghdad. , Sir, i£P,oint;nent of British Consul for Basrah. The British Chamber of Commerce Basrah has j.orwarded to this Chamber copies of correspondence with the Administrative Inspector Basrah regarding the appointment of a British Consul. It would appear that both the Foreign and Colonial Offices each consider that the other should bear the expenses of such an appointment and that it has been finally suggested that an unofficial British Resident as an unsalaried British Consul at Basrah would meet the case, he retaining 75% of the Consular fees collected as remuneration for the work done. I am directed to inform your Excellency that the ' members of this Chamber view with much concern the apparent indifference on the part of the home Government to British trade, interests in 'Iraq by the proposed half measure above referred to. In the opinion of this Chamber the duties of a Consul in Basrah cannot be satisfactorily carried out by a part time Resident and that as a regularly appointed Consul was considered necessary in pre war days so it is felt that such an appointment is still more necessary under present conditions. The American and French Governments find it advisable \ to appoint their Consular representatives in this country where British trade interests are of far greater importance than those of either of these countries. It is also considered that an unofficial British Resident such as suggested would carry no weight* 2 weight with or would be considered of no importance by the ’Iraq Goverment with whom in the performance of his duties he would necessarily be brought constantly in touch. As regards the question of expense and the cost bfupkeep of a British Consulate in Basrah this Chamber is informed that the Consular fees which would be collected are ample to cover the salaries of a Consul and staff. The former British Consulate in Basrah, which it is understood is British property, affords ample accommodation for living quarters and office room so that no expense would be incurred for rent of premises. It therefore cannot be urged by the home Government that the appointment of a regular Consul in Basrah would be any expense to the state. Apart from the matter of expense which it is not considered should enter into the importance of the question, this Chamber feels that the failure of the home Government to appoint a regular Consul in Basrah will prove a serious detriment to British trade interests' in ’Iraq. Basrah is a Port of growing importance and the Customs statistics prove that the greater part of the trade is of British origin. The above \ are the views of both the Baghdad and Basrah Chambers of Commerce with which it is hoped that Your Excellency will approve and that you will do your utmost to impress upon the home Government the necessity for the immediate appointment of a regular British Consul in Basrah. It is suggested that one from the Levant Consular service with, if possible, fonner experience of this country and with a good knowledgeknowledge of Arabic would be most suitable.

It is not anticipated that occasions on which the assistance of a consular officer at Basra would be required would be frequent, and lord Curzon does not consider the appointment of a special consular officer at Basra to be necessary. 3. In view, however, of the fact that the British Consulate at Mohammerah is in close proximity to Basra I am to enquire whether Viscount Feel would have any objection to the officer holding the appointment of, or acting for. His Majesty's Consul at Mohammerah being appointed also His Majesty's Consul at Basra, on the under standing that no additional expenditure would be incurred on account of such appointment, and that in the event of the volume of work at Basra requiring attention becoming considerable the question of His Majesty's Consul at Mohammerah ceasing to fulfil the duties of His Majesty's Consul at Basra would be considered. 4.
