A preface, explaining the points at issue. 2. A historical summary of the voluminous but important correspondence directly hearing upon those points. 3. Conclusions on the present situation, with special reference to the proposal to submit the Turco-Persian frontier dispute to The Hague Tribunal. The preface will be found on p. 1, the historical summary on p. 7, and the conclusions on p. 31. Part I. Mr. Marling (Tehran), No. 17, January 28, 1910. Preface. At various times from 1899 to 1910 His Majesty's Government have extended assurances of support to the Sheikh of Mohammerah: these assurances are printed in extenso in Appendix (A) (p. 47). They include a guarantee to protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action may be alleged, and an undertaking to safeguard the sheikh (and his male descendants) against an unprovoked attack by a foreign Power on his jurisdiction and recognised rights or on his pro perty in Persia. Early in 1908, the sheikh expressed appre hensions to His Majesty's consul on account of the unsatisfactory position on the Turco-Persian frontier, evidently anticipating a possible exten sion to the neighbourhood of Mohammerah of C7 the Turkish encroachments which had recently taken place further north, near Urmia. The sheikh's apprehensions led to the issue [2440 c—10] Bof the following despatch to His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople;— In the Mohammerah district His Majesty's Govern- To Sir N. O'Oonor, ment are not prepared to recognise any other frontier February 25 than that laid down by the mediating commissioners in 1908. 1850, as indicated in red on the accompanying sketch map. . , . Any disturbance of the status quo at Moham merah would affect British interests, and might not improbably lead to the active intervention of His Majesty's Government, who have given the sheikh certain assurances in regard to his territory. . . . In the event, no Turkish encroachments actually took place on the Mohammerah frontier, and Sir N. O'Conor accordingly had no occasion to make representations to the Sublime Porte. The subject, however, gave rise to some correspondence—more or less, at the time, of an academical character—as to the proper boundary between Turkey and Mohammerah ; and now, owing to the proposal to submit the whole frontier dispute to The Hague Tribunal, the question has acquired immediate interest. The correspondence in question, which was between the Foreign Office and British officers in Persia, and took place from 1909 to 1910, was essentially as follows :— Lieutenant Wilson, adverting to the above Sir G. Barclay despatch to Sir N. O'Conor, pointed out that the geptemberO^'l909.' boundary recommended by the Anglo-Russian mediating commissioners in 1850 differed, con siderably to the disadvantage of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, from the frontier locally recog nised by the Mohammerah and Bussorah authorities ; and he urged, principally on grounds of local expediency, that His Majesty's Government should disregard the line of 1850, and simply take their stand on a subsequent declaration made by Great Britain and Russia to the Turkish and Persian Governments, that the whole boundary between Turkey and Persia was to be found within the limits of the frontier zone, as indicated on the so-called t( identic ' Anglo-Russian map, which was com municated to Turkey and Persia respectively in 18^9 and 1870.* He represented that this * Both the line of 1850 (which is confined to the Mohammerah district aud does not extend to the whole frontier) and the frontier as locally recognised at Mohammerah are within the frontier zone as indicated on the 'identic' map. The frontier zone comprises a region 20 to 50 miles in width, the whole length of the frontier from Mount Ararat to the Persian Gulf.attitude on the part of Itis Majesty's Govern ment would be conducive to tlie perpetuation, much to be desired, of the local status quo, the maintenance of which, moreover, had been agreed upon—though merely as a temporary expedient pending a final settlement—in a protocal signed by Turkey and Persia in 1869. Consul McDouall (Mohammerah), No. 65, June 12, 1909. Sir C. Ford (Constantinople), No. 526 a, November 14, 1893. Lieutenant Wilson's views were generally approved by His Majesty's Minister at Tehran. His Majesty's Government, however, did not feel that it would be prudent to adopt the full suggestions of that officer; in arriving at this conclusion they had regard to the complicated nature of the negotiations which preceded and followed the ratification of the Treaty of Erzeroum in 1848, and they were not unin fluenced by the knowledge that, as recently as 1893, Turkey, relying upon the wording of that treaty, had attempted to revive claims to the ownership of the district, as distinct from the town, of Mohammerab. The reply to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran was accordingly as follows :— To Sir G. Barclay, No. 146, October 27, 1909. While His Majesty's Government have no desire to disturb the frontier status quo as locally observed, and which, they are well aware, has never precisely coincided with the line as drawn in 1850 by the mediating commissioners, and indeed as subsequently accepted by the Persian Government, they would hesitate to approve Lieutenant Wilson's contention that the line as defined in 1850 was cancelled by any subsequent declaration of Great Britain and Russia. That line was, after an exhaustive examination of the conflicting claims of Persia and Turkey, defined by the mediating commissioners as an equitable compromise, and such evidence as there is goes to show that it was upheld by the later commission which met at Constan tinople in 1875. His Majesty's Government could not, therefore, formally support the Sheikh of Mohammerah, in claiming that his frontier extends beyond that line, except after consultation with the Russian Government . . . . , and as the result of an agreement with the Turkish Government, who are in possession of a copy of the map of 1850. Consul-General Cox (Bushire), No. 2, Political, May 8, 1910. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf, on learning the terms of this reply, supported a representation from Lieutenant Wilson, urging His Majesty's Government to go further and to disregard the line of the mediating commis sioners of 1850 and adhere to the boundary as4 locally recognised. In support of this attitude it was urged:— 1. That the line of 1850 threw the sheikh's personal residence, &amp;c., at Failieh into Turkish limits. 2. That whereas the centre of the fairway of the Shatt-el-Arab was the dividing line univer sally recognised in practice for many years past, the line of 1850 gave the whole channel of that river to Turkey, including two important islands now regarded as Persian territory.'^ A map to illustrate the two lines of frontier was forwarded and is annexed. The reply of His Majesty's Government to these and further representations was substantially to the following effect:— 1. As early as 1850 Sheikh Jabir of Mo- F| rst Conference hammerah had possessed a fort, if not a residence at Mohammerah, 1 January 28, 1850 at Pailieh, on the destruction of which, with that (Enclosure 2 in of another fort, the commissioners insisted on the no ground that it rendered freedom of navigation to March 30, 1850). Eussorah uncertain. 2. His Majesty's Government had no desire to To Consul-General disturb the status quo as locally observed, and if ^ T ° x |'^p^J^i there were danger of the question being raised June 27, 1910. would devote their efforts to the prevention of ^ S ir ^ rc j^ such a contingency. If, indeed, the question August 30, 1910. ' were forced upon His Majesty's Government, it To Cousul-General would, of course, be open to them to negotiate No. 3, Political, for the recognition of the locally accepted ^ q 0133 ^ 61 ' 15 ' boundary, while retaining that of the mediating commission as the basis of discussion; and they could with equal justice refuse to tolerate the recognition of anything but the loeal status quo as regarded the southern [i.e., Mohammerah) por tion of the boundary, until the Turkish Govern ment admitted the frontier zone! of the mediating commissioners in the north. * In reference to point 2, it may be mentioned that, by article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum, Persian shit s have the right to navigate the Shatt-el-Arab in full liberty up to the point where the Persian frontier joins that of Turkey; this clause at any rate secures freedom of access vifi the Shatt-el- Arab to Mohammerah town and the River Karun. I By a clerical error in the original despatch the word ' line' was inserted instead of 'frontier zone.'5 It will be seen from the foregoing summary that the attitude finally assumed by His Majesty's Government did not differ very materially from the views advanced by Lieutenant Wilson and the British resident in the Persian Gulf. Those officers urged, in effect, that since, so far as Turkey was concerned, His Majesty's Government did not yet seem irrevocably committed to father the line of 1850, His Majesty's Government should disregard it. His Majesty's Government, while holding that it would be prudent to retain the 1850 line as the basis of discussion, were prepared, if the question were raised, to negotiate for, to press, and, in certain contingencies, to insist upon, the recognition of the boundary as locally observed.* India Office, There was some further correspondence in June.), 1911. the India Office on the subject: this is referred to in a subsequent part of this paper. Sir G. Barclay (Tehran), No. 148, Telegraphic, May 1, 1911. The question which now arises is that of the procedure to he adopted by His Majesty s Government, in view of the proposal to submit the Turco-Persian frontier dispute to The Hague Tribunal. This question, which is somewhat more complicated owing to recent Turkish attempts to control lighting and buoyage at the entrance to the Shatt-el-Arab, will be dealt with in the final portion of this memorandum. In order, however, that the conclusions eventually adopted may be arrived at with a full knowledge of the facts, a historical summary of the earlier correspondence—embracing the views of Sir H. Layard, Sir IT. Rawlinson, Sir Justin Sheil, Sir Fenwick Williams, Sir Stratford Can ning, and other authorities, on Mohammerah, and embodying the important negotiations on the subject from 1843-52—has been prepared, and forms Part II of this memorandum. The diplomatic correspondence of those years is of cardinal importance, since Turkey has only recently laid special stress upon it in the nego tiations which led up to the protocol signed at Tehran on the 21st December, 1911 (see Appendix (B), p. 51). ♦ It must not be overlooked that Russia, by virtue of her past mediation, is concerned in this question; and His Majesty's Government would seem almost bound not to abandon formally the joint line of the mediating commis sioners of 1850, without previous consultation with the Russian Government. [2410 c—10] C7 Part II. Summary of Correspondence, 1843-52. The enquiry contained in Part II of this memorandum goes rather beyond the immediate points at issue ; since, however, the basis of the proposed reference to The Hague Tribunal is to be the Treaty of Erzeroum (1848), it may prove convenient to have the conflicting claims, as they were advanced and dealt with 70 years ago, set forth here, as possibly Turkey may now attempt to reassert those claims. Sir S. Canning-, No. 70, April 27, 1844. Sir Henry Layard, who was British Ambas sador in Turkey from 1878 to 1880, has published in his ' Early Adventures' an account of the earlier negotiations respecting Mohammerah. His statement is reproduced in full in Appen dix (C), p. 52 ; but since it is in some respects an accurate account of what took place ; since it has been made public—though of a highly confi dential nature; and since it may be produced, as the ' impartial ' evidence of a former British Ambassador, by the Turkish Government at The Hague Tribunal, it is of sufficient import ance to justify the quotation here of certain extracts, as an introduction to a more detailed examination of the question :— Soon after my return to Constantinople .... the joint mediation offered by the English and Russian Governments to Turkey and Persia to prevent a war, which was then on the point of breaking out between them, was accepted by the two Powers It 'was necessary for the representatives of the mediating Powers at Constantinople to make a careful investigation into the claims of the contending parties, and to propose to them for their acceptance a fair and equitable arrangement founded upon their respective rights and interests. Sir Stratford Canning entrusted me with this duty on his part The knowledge which I had acquired of the territory in dispute, and of the history and traditions of the tribes which inhabited it, proved of much use to me. I was able to prepare a project of settlement which appeared to me just to both parties, and warranted by the proofs which they had produced in support of their respective claims. It was entirely approved by Sir Stratford Canning, and sent by him to Lord Aberdeen, to be communicated to the Eussian Government. He fully expected that he would speedily receive authority to submit it to the Porte for its acceptance. The result of my examination of the evidence and maps furnished8 me was that the claims of Turkey to the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab and to Mohammerah were well founded I consequently proposed in my scheme, as a fair compromise, that the new frontier-line should be drawn through the desert country to the west of llawizah, at some distance from the Shatt-el-Arab, across the Haffar, and midway down the delta to the sea My sue -e -estion, approved and adopted by Sir [ Note .—This extract, written over forty years ' W T ^ AVkPrrlppn later, conveys a mistaken impression of the corre- Btratford Canning, was submitted by Lord Aberdeen spondence ^ In regard to Mohammerah, Sir S. to the Russian Government, which declined to accede Canning's recommendations ivej-e approved, with t o it, and not only uphold the claim, of Pcraia to Mohammerah and the left bank of the Shatt-el-Aiab t rfta ty. On other points of the frontier, e.g., Irom the Haffar to the sea, but insisted upon the cession Zohab, his Excellency's views did not so fully to her of territory on its east bank (i .e., left bank), P 16 ^ 1 '- A - 1 •] which she had not even claimed Lord Aberdeen, who was desirous of deferring to Russia, accepted her views and instructed Sir Stratford Canning to recommend them to the Porte. He sent for me after the arrival of Lord Aberdeen s despatch to this effect Without saying a word he handed me the despatch. I read it, and remarked that I was deeply grieved to find that Lord Aberdeen had come to a decision which, in my opinion, was not consistent with justice and right, and was not in the interests of England. He requested me to draw up an answer to Lord Aberdeen's despatch pointing out the objections to the arrangement proposed by Russia, the injustice that would be done to the Porte, and the discredit that would fall upon England as a mediator it she showed so flagrant a spirit of partiality to Pei'sia. I wrote the draft of a despatch in this sense, which was adopted by Sir Stratford Canning. But it failed to produce the desired effect, and nothing remained to him but to carry out the instructions he had received from Lord Aberdeen The precis of official correspondence which now follows falls into three sub-divisions :— (A,.)—T/ie initial investigations and the earlier Conferences at Erzeroum. Period 1843-14. B.)—TAe negotiation of the Treaty of Erzeroum and the conditions of ratification. Period 1815-48. (C.) —T/?(? attempt of the mediating Powers to demarcate the frontier in accordance with the treaty. Period 1850—52. (A.) The Initial Investigations and the earlier Conferences at Erzeroum. Period 1843-44. Apart from the records of what passed at the conferences at Erzeroum, the leading documents for this period are a detailed and learned historical9 memorandum on Mohammerah by Major Rawlin- son; a general survey of the whole frontier Canning No. 70, dispute by Sir Stratford Canning ; two despatches April 27,1844. from Colonel Shell, British Minister at Tehran, British Shel110 elucidating the question from the Persian aspect; Commissioners certain Hussian memoirs ; and, finally, a despatch recording the considered views and decision of Colonel Sheil, Her Majesty's Government, after a very full September 27 examination of all the arguments, and after con- 1843. sultation with the Russian Government. Colonel Sheil, p r ^cis, which here largely consists of May 14,1844. extracts from the first two documents, does not Memorandum follow implicitly all the arguments advanced by Count'nes^drode. Sir Stratford Canning regarding the ownership of September 1844. Mohammerah, partly because there was a certain McMnoramhiin,^ divergency between the conclusions first reached Enclosure ill Excellency and those urged by Colonel Sir Stratford Canning's No. 240, Sheil; partly because his Excellency ultimately November 2, 1844. 9( j m itted {pace Sir Henry Layard) that more Lord Aberdeen to a e Sir Stratford regard should be had to the factor ot presenp- Canning, No. 5,^ tion, which militated against Turkey; and partly January 7, 18io. . because, on a review of the complete correspond ence and at this distance of time, arguments and data appear in a slightly altered focus. If, however, as appears possible, the Mohammerah question is again reopened, and especially if it is brought before The Hague Tribunal, a more detailed reference to the correspondence, which is now being printed, will be required. One of the points most warmly debated at the Conference of Erzeroum was the question of right to Mohammerah. That town had been attacked and razed to the ground by the Pasha of Pagdad in 1837, for the reason that it was becoming a thriving commercial port, and bid fair to endanger the trade of the neighbouring town of Bussorah. This episode greatly embittered the relations of Persia and Turkey : the former Power claimed an indemnity of one million sterling on account of property destroyed and the indignity suffered ; the latter Power not only rebutted the claim for indemnity, but put forward a counter-demand for the ownership of Mohammerah and the surround ing country, and to the allegiance of the resident tribe. Owing to this and other causes, a rupture between the two Mussulman Powers appeared imminent: it was in such circumstances that Great Britain and Russia, more nearly interested than any other European Powers in the mainte nance of peace in the East, olfered to mediate, [2i40 c—10] D10 and that the disputants were finally brought together in conference at Erzeroura. In the treaties then subsisting between Persia Major Eawlinson s and Turkey no specific mention had been made j nn e i844 1 on of any frontier point south of Mendali (not far Sultan Murad's ^ 1 , Treaty of 1639. from Khanikin). The treaty of 1639—the instrument relied upon and appealed to by either litigant—contained only a general allusion to ' Bussorah and its acknowledged dependencies ' Major Rawlinson s as the southern limit of the Turkish Empire, Great uncertainty attached, as it still does, to the 011 Mohammerah. extent of territory dependent on Bussorah at the period of that treaty. Less conclusive evidence than precise treaty Sir Stratford ^ stipulation was therefore necessarily advanced, 1^44. based upon the geographical features of the country, as showing the natural limits, and upon the allegiance paid by the resident tribe. The areoorraphical position of Mohammerah Geographical and the extent of the rival claims will best be understood by reference to the accompanying Canning No. 70, rough sketch map. The united waters of the April 27, 1844. Euphrates and Tigris, receiving, after their junction, the name of the Shatt-el-Arab, flow Major Rawlinson's nearly due south-east from Korna to the Persian J^J^mmry 6, Gulf. The River Karun, rising in the Persian 1844. mountains of Luristan, runs nearly due south west until it approaches within about 3 miles of the Shatt-el-Arab, and then a portion of its waters is diverted suddenly to the south-east, flowing through the Banishere Channel, parallel with the Shatt-el-Arab, to the sea. The two rivers (Karun and Shatt-el-Arab) are united at their point of nearest approximation by a channel which, according to the best authorities, is an ancient canal or artificial cut. The town of Mohammerah is built upon both banks of this channel (the Haffar), through which the waters of the Karun and not, as formerly, those of the Shatt-el-Arab, now flow. The Karun had till about the year 1765 another outlet into the Persian Gulf called the Goban, which was parallel to, and about 10 miles to the east of, the Bamishcre outlet. The latter was the natural outlet of the lliver Karun, whose waters were forced into the Goban by an artificial dam; after the destruction of that dam the Goban Channel again became dry. In a memorandum prepared by Major (after wards Sir Henry) Bawlinson—a paper which was held to elucidate the subject of dispute more11 than any other document of the time—the following passage occurs :— Major Rawlinson's The rule of appropriation from the time of authentic Memorandum of history appears then to have been simply this ; that January 6, 1844, j t on Mohamraerah. ' le lands deriving water from the 1 igris and Euphrates belonged to Irak-el-Arab (Turkey), while the country along the banks of the Karun Avas within the limits of Khuzistan (Persia). Nothing, perhaps, could be more simple in principle than this distribution, but nothing could be more fluctuating and perplexed than it has proved in practice, owing to the numerous changes in the courses of the rivers. [Incidentally, it may he observed that the justice of Major Rawlinson's conclusion has been further confirmed since he wrote: For the Bamishere Channel, which was then a regular means of access to Mohammerah from the sea, is now only navigable for half its length by boats of small draught, thus rendering the Shatt-el-Arab the sole means of water transport between the sea and not only Mohammerah, but likewise Ahwaz on the Karun.] Tribal Apart from the general rule of geographical appropriation, rendered uncertain as has been Major Rawlinson's , i ,i n j ,• n i.i • Memorandum of shown by the fluctuating course ot the rivers, January 6, 1844, questions, more or less interwoven, appeared on Mohammerah. x &gt; it . it n. T to be involved m the dispute between lurkey and Persia respecting Mohammerah, the one the dependency of the tribe of Chaab, the other the right of territory to certain lands upon which portions of the tribe had settled. At the time under discussion (1843), the delta formed at the mouth of the two rivers, Karun and Shatt-el-Arab, together with a large portion of territory to the east of it, the town of Mohammerah, and the northern bank of the Ilaffar Canal, were inhabited by the tribe of Chaab or Kiab, whose chief settlement was at Fellahieh, an inland town some 30 miles to the east of Mohammerah.* * This memorandum does not deal especially with British relations with the Chaab tribe: but it may be mentioned that both Colonel Sheil and Captain (afterwards General Sir Arnold) Keiuball reported in 1843 that, in the inrercourse which had continually taken place between the Chaab and the East India Company, the tribe had either been treated as independent or regarded as subjects of the Shah (see Sir Stratford Canning, No. 70, April 27, 1844). A full account of British-Indian relations with the Chaab will be found in the precis, dated March 1911, by Lieutenant Wilson on 'Relations of the British Government with the Tribes and Sheikhs of Arabistan.'12 Major Rawlinson's memorandum contains a graphic and detailed history of this tribe. As to the earlier years, it is here only requisite to establish that it came from the Turkish dominions; that its emigration took place about the year 1G83 (thus after the treaty of 1639); that it settled on the delta, at that time a district of land too insignificant to excite the attention of either Persia or Turkey ; and that until the year 1740 it remained dependent upon Turkey.* The political condition of the Chaab then underwent a rapid and remarkable change. Under their famous chief, Salman, they dis possessed another tribe of the town of Durak and dependent territory, and thus obtained a per manent footing in a country to which the right of Persia was unquestioned. Sheikh Salman then pursued on all sides a systematic course of territorial encroachment, his acquisitions in Persia extending eastward to the Hindian River and northward along the Karun to the vicinity of Bend-i-Kir, while from the Turks, partly by intimidation and partly by bribery, he obtained for his tribe Abadan Island (El Khizr), the territory of Dowasir on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, and a tract of country north of the Haffar Channel, comprising the districts of Mohammerah, Haffar, and Tamar, along the Shatt-el-Arab. The Turkish authorities seem to have enter tained apprehensions for the security of Bussorah itself : a naval engagement accordingly took place in 1765 between the Chaab and Turkish fleets, and fortune again favoured Sheikh Salman.t It is from this period that Major Rawlinson dates the emancipation of the Chaab tribe from any further dependency upon Turkey. This creation of a formidable and almost inde pendent Power upon the shores of the Persian Gulf was not viewed with indifference by Persia any more than by Turkey, and two attempts were made by the then Shah to reduce Slieikh Salman to obedience, but without decided success. * Major Rawlinson is explicit in stating that at the time of the treaty of 1G39 the Cliaab were settled at Wasit in Turkish territory. Mr. Lorimer, in his recently compiled ' Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf,' states that their original home was in Nejd f The account of the causes of this naval action, as related by Lieutenant Wilson in his precis dated March 1911, differs somewhat from that of Sir Henry Rawlinson.—A. P.13 None the less there was an essential difference between the subsequent relations of the tribe to Turkey and Persia respectively for, while con stantly endeavouring to establish its indepen dence, from the moment it threw off completely the yoke of the former Power it appears to have become more or less subject to Persia. More over, since this time the Chaab used the Persian MinisteratTehran, fla &amp;' thou S h '' as thought that this might No. 378, perhaps be the particular consequeDce of their August 19, i 43. cree( | as ant [ possibly not an acknowledg ment of subjection to Persia. Major Rawlinson's it was about this time that Sheikh Salman January 6, 1844. removed the seat of his government to Fellahieh, within the well-established frontier of the Persian province of Pars. About four-fifths of the extent of country now occupied by the Chaab was unquestionably Persian territory, and the liability of the tribe to pay the Persian Crown the revenues of these lands, if that Power w r ere in a condition to assert its rights, does not appear ever to have been questioned. Major Kawlinson infers, from the increased connection which was observable between the Persian Government and the Chaab subsequently to the foundation of Fellahieh, that the distinction between liability for payment of rent, as tenants of the soil, and of a fixed tribute, as subjects, was gradually lost sight of, and that the tribe, residing for the most part in Persian territory, governed by a chief whose capital was likewise in Persian territory, and subjected almost yearly to demands for revenue to the Persian Crown, came to be re garded as Turkish colonists who had immigrated to the Persian territory, and, by a continued residence of many years, had naturalised them selves as Persian subjects. Major Rawlinson's The arguments of the Turkish Government Jarmary 1 'g'iS -T^ ^ avour an uninterrupted claim to the allegiance of the Chaab were simply these: that Turkey had never made any formal renunciation of her rights; that the Chaab, notwithstanding the removal of the seat of government to Fellahieh, continued to hold lands upon the Haffar and the Shatt-el-Arab subject to Turkey, and even to pay the revenue of those lands to the Governor of Eussorah : that the fees formerlv payable by the tribe to Turkey for other districts were merely withheld because those districts had become desert; and that a robe of office was still furnished by Turkey to the Sheikh of the [2440 c—10] E Sir Stratford Canning, No. 70, April 27, 1844. Captain Kemball to Her Majesty'sChaab, in accordance 'with the old fashion of annual investiture. Major Rawlinson, in commenting on these claims, observes that to him, ever since the death of Sheikh Salman (1768), the Chaab appeared to have been virtually independent of Turkey, and that the notion of the indefeasibility of their allegiance to that Power seemed an invention of late vears. When the Chaab had interfered with the Turkish territory on the Shatt-el-Arab, they did so either as conquerors or as purchasers of the freehold right or leasehold tenure. None of the relations which they thus bore to the Turkish Government, as occupants of the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab, appeared to indicate their national dependency. ' On the contrary' he continues, in a passage which, desiring to emphasise for reference, I have caused to be printed in italics, ' as they have continued almost uninterruptedly to pay to the Government of Bussorah (i.e., Turkey) the rent of the lauds of Haffar and Tamar above Mohammerahy which they obtained by a grant from Suleiman Pasha of Bagdad, while they have long ceased all other payments ' [i.e., for land on the left (east) bank of the Shatt-el-Arab J, 'the pre sumption is that they have considered themselves liable for these lands only, and that they must have thus regarded themselves in the light of foreigners holding Turkish property, either in farm or by right of occupuncy.''* Major Eawlinson considered that the relation which the Chaab had borne to Turkey since Sheikh Salman's death, to times comparatively modern {i.e., when he wrote in 1844), so far from being one of protection and dependency, had been marked by open and almost constant hostility. That the Chaab were Turkish subjects at the period of Sultan Murad's treaty of 1639, which was still supposed, in its definition of the terri torial rights of either Tower, to be in force in 1844, was a point beyond question; that the tribe had been virtually independent of Turkey for a hundred years was equally a matter of notoriety. I now pass to the actual town of Moham- Major Rawlinson's , i • t j. • • «i m-u rM, i Memorandum of merah and its immediate vicinity.

Major Rawlin- son says that the Sheikh was influenced in this withdrawal rather by a disinclination to come into collision with the growing power of the Muntefik tribe, and by the necessity of preparation asrainst Persia, than by any respect for the rights, or deference to the views of, Turkey. It was at this time, or about 1S12, that he built a fort upon either side of the Hatfar Canal, with the view, it was stated, of protecting his frontier against the Muntefik, and be entrusted the defence of the place to his confidential servant Mirdow, of the Muhaisin tribe, which was at that time subordinate to the Chaab. It was a place of no consequence at first, but under the increasingly independent rule of Haji Jabir, the son of Mirdow, and a man of exceptional capacity, its favourable situation attracted com merce, and it rapidly rose into eminence as the mercantile town of Mohammerah. Major Rawlinson's (Parenthetically it may be mentionned that, Memorandum with certain interruptions, Haii Jabir acted as dated January 6, a o 1844, on ' deputy at Mohammerah from about 1820 till Lieutenaiit rah ' 1858 on behalf of the Chaab Sheikhs, whose Wilson's precis, principal place of residence continued to be dated March 1911 an( j j n 2862 he finally superseded No.\ Telegraphic, them. The present (1912) Sheikh Khazal of March 20, 1912. Mohammerah, is the son of Haji Jabir, and rules over both the Chaab and Muhaisin tribes.)

Jabir's anomalous position began of course to be submitted to enquiry. 0 It was in the last- named year that the Pasha of Bagdad, as already related, marched against Mohammerah, took it by assault, and plundered all the merchandise stored in its warehouses : he even made a demonstration against Fellahieh, which compelled the ruling Sheikh Thamir to seek refuge for a time at Ivoweit. This Sheikh Thamir, on his return, signed, for his own personal ends, a convention with the Pasha of Bagdad, securing himself in occupation of the sheikhship, and pledging the allegiance of his tribe to Turkey. But Sheikh Jabir, who could not so easily forgive the destruction of his flourishing town by the Turks, refused to be bound by this conven- * Sheikh Haji Jabir settled directly with the Government of Bussorah for the land rent of the town of Mohammerah.16 tion ; he now asserted his independence of Thamir, and threatened, if interfered with, to call in the protection of the Persians. It was from the year 1837 that Major Rawlinson dated the direct political connection between the town of Moham- merah and Persia. In the next few years Persia seems to have intervened more actively in the affairs of Mohammerah, though she did not disturb Sheikh Haji Jabir; at Fellahieh, on the other hand, she had deposed Sheikh Thamir, and installed his nephew Pariss in his place. Such, in general outline, was the result of Major Pawlinson's investigations. He recom mended, and his advice was in the main endorsed by Sir Stratford Canning, that the frontier should be defined as shown on the accompanying sketch map ; it will be observed that the suggested line passes lengthways through the centre of the island of El Khizr or Abadan, then, leaving the town of Mohammerah to Persia, it runs parallel to the Shatt-el-Arab at some distance inland from the bank. In recommending this line. Major Rawlinson estimated that the only valuable lands which Turkey would lose would be those along both banks of the Haffar Canal, where the double town of Mohammerah was situated ; but to these lands, he added, she could not advance any valid geographical claim, and lor many years they had been practically lost to her. It is important to recall once more that at this time the boats bound for Mohammerah used largely the Bamishere Channel, now no longer navigable; and doubtless this was not without influence upon Major Rawlinson's conclusions. The only evidence produced at the Conference Evidence at at Erzeroum relative to the allegiance ot the conference Chaab tribe is to be found in the examination of (1843). Sheikh Thamir, the late chief at Pellahieh, who Report of -i m i m . • ninth conference, had been summoned to attend by lurkey.

Certain natives of Bussorah had indeed 1843. given evidence to the same effect, and a certificate U llliam8 ' in a similar sense, and signed by thirty-five December 30, 1843 inhabitants of Koweit, was also produced; but ( Enclosure 2 )-17 Mr. R.

Sir Stratford Canning observes that all these persons (including the Koweitis !) were Turkish subiects residing at a distance from Moham- merah. As proof of territorial claims, Turkey produced certain deeds of sale, court rolls, and deeds of foundation in mortmain. These documents bore, in the opinion of the Mediating Commissioners, the marks of antiquity; but Colonel Sheil, Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, pointed out that even if the authenticity of these documents— none of which was of more recent date than 1766—were admitted, they merely proved a temporary possession, and that similar docu ments might be, and had been, produced to support a claim to Tabreez and Kasvin, which, in consequence of the defeat of the Persian armies, were known to have been held for a short period by Turkey. Most of the European maps produced, including that of Macdonald Kinneir, adopted the Shatt-el-Arab as the boundary between the two Empires. The Turkish Plenipotentiary somewhat unintelligibly cited also the geo graphical work of Macdonald Kinneir to the effect that Abadan Island had formerly been in the possession of Turkey, but having been conquered by the Chaab Sheikh Salman in the middle of the 18th century had remained in the possession of his successors. His object was presumably to establish the original ownership of Turkey, but the quotation served also to confirm the duration of the severance of Turkey's connection. The British Commissioners at Erzeroum, Mr. Curzon and Colonel (afterwards Sir Penwick) Williams, basing their opinions on the evidence produced.at the Conferences, and on a paper fur nished by General Monteith, who had long been employed in Persia, considered that the balance of probabilities respecting Mohammerah was immeasurably in favour of Turkey. But, at the time of writing, they had not yet seer Major Bawlinson's memorandum, which gave a totally different complexion to the matter. Sir Stratford Canning's view was summed u 1 ? in the following sentence :— The whole results iu a presumption that the original territorial right is in favour of Turkey, and the right of conquest and possession is in favour of Persia. [2440 c—10] FEarly in 18M, tlie proceedings of the Con ference were abruptly suspended by the rupture of negotiations by the Ottoman Plenipotentiary. It is unnecessary to relate the causes of this dissension; but, in the deadlock which now ensued, Sir Stratford Canning addressed the Earl of Aberdeen in the following terras :— Confirmed in the persuasion, which 1 have long ^ir Stratford ^ entertained, that the Conferences at Erzeroum will not ^p 1 ^ 11 ^ 1844.^* termiaate in peace without the expression ot a decisive opinion on the part of the mediating Powers, I have prepared, and have now the honour to submit to your Lordship, a statement embracing all the points of the negotiation, and suggesting what I conceive to be the most practicable mode of settlement. Sir Stratford Canning's statement had reference to the whole frontier, and to other subjects of dispute, and the suggested settlement was a plan of compromise, based on concessions in one direction balanced against corresponding con cessions in another. His Excellency pointed out that as the territorial claims were advanced almost exclusively by Turkey, while those to indemnity proceeded from Persia, the most obvious expedient would be to seek in the one class of claims the means of forming a set-off against the other. He accord ingly suggested that the pecuniary claims of the Persian Government should be entirely relin quished, and that, in return, Persia should be allotted the town of Mohamraerah ; and, in that region, a frontier as proposed by Major Rawlinson (see yellow line on map opposite page 16). By this arrangement, it was pointed out, the uninter rupted navigation of the River Karun (through the Bamishere Channel which was then open) would be given to Persia, and that of the Sbatt- el-Arab to Turkey, whose only sacrifice would be a doubtful claim to the town of Mohamraerah. If, however, it was added, this plan should fail, owing to the growing obstruction of the Bamishere Channel from natural causes, then both parties might be provided for by the only remaining expedient of placing the town and delta of Mohamraerah under the administration of a Chaab sheikh, securing a common right of access to the town by both parties, and exemp tion from all duties, but such as should be separately levied by the authorities of Turkey and Persia, on goods and shipping destined19 respectively for admission within the limits of either territory. To Sir Stratford ^ was i n 1844 that the Emperor Nicholas I September 13, ,J visited England ; and Her Majesty's Government 184/l - took advantage of the presence of Count Nessel- rode to communicate fully with his Excellency on this question. The Russian Vice-Chancellor, while agreeing in many respects with Sir Stratford Canning's suggestions, in some particulars proposed modi fications. He submitted that it would be prefer able to leave Persia in possession of Mohammerah and of the left bank of the Shati-el-Arab, with the right of free navigation of that river, ' which in reality was the sole outlet for the exports of Southern Persia.' In the existing state of un certainty he considered that the principle of uti possidetis should apply, and that that principle militated strongly in favour of the maintenance of the frontier of the Shatt-el-Arab. Persia, in return, was to abandon her claim for indemnity on account of the pillage of Mohammerah in 1837. Sir Stratford Canning, while admiring the simplicity of Count Nesselrode's proposals, added Sir Stratford that unfortunately ' the reason that was alleged NoTembefl ' mi against the original propositions was equally available for the rejection of the modifications; for if the consent of Persia was not to be expected in the one case, the refusal of the Porte might be equally anticipated in the other.' This anticipa tion of his Excellency was amply justified by the subsequent attitude of Turkey ; however, with regard to Mohammerah, he admitted that the Turkish claim was too uncertain to be made good against a continued occupation of eighty years either by Persia herself, or by a tribe, whose headquarters had been situated within the Persian territory twice the length of that period. The principle of uti possidetis might therefore, he considered, be applied to that district without injustice, though care should be taken to give it no extension unwarranted by fact. The Persians, he added, were not in possession of the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab higher than Mohammerah, nor could they navigate any part of that river without being liable to the duties levied on shipping and merchandise by the Ottoman au thorities. Sir Stratford Sir Stratford Canning subsequently ascertained Canning, No. 240, t Nesselrode's views on the Mohammerah November 2, 1844.20 question had been derived from Count Medem, Russian Minister at Tehran. Count Medem had obtained his information from a Persian memo randum, which Major Eawlinson had demonstrated to be a mass of inaccuracies. This Persian memo- randum, with comments, will be found in ap pendix E, page 57. As showing the owner ship of land on the left bank of the Shatt-el- Arab, Sir Stratford Canning quoted the folloAving additional statements of Major Rawlinson, founded upon local enquiries and an intimate knowledge of the country—statements which, having an obvious bearing on the question of the actual frontier, at the present time, are of considerable interest:— Above the Island of Abadan occurs the mouth of the Sir Stratford . 1 n i *i ii • ORiiDinffj -S o» 1 d 5, Haffar Canal, with about a mile of territory belonging j uly ^ 1844 to Mohammerah. Above you have for 2 miles the date No. 240, groves of Budijee cultivated by the Chaab, but paying ^ovembei 2, 18 U. revenue to the Bawee Arabs, then occur for 4 miles the lands of Tamar inhabited by the Chaabees, subject to Fellahieh, hvt paying revenue to Bussorah, and above that point the Muntefik and other Turkish subjects possess the entire territory for 19 miles into Bussorah. .... the lands watered by the Shatt from Girdelan to the sea are registered in the Bussorah records as dependencies of that city from the earliest period to which such documents ascend, and all the ancient geographical notices confirm this territorial allotment. IIer Majesty's Government, in conveying their ultimate instructions to Sir Stratford Canning, gi r Stratford after agreement with the Russian Government, j^ulTry 7 NO i8i5. ccnsidered that the only fair and rational mode of striking a correct balance between the parties was by regarding undisturbed possession of long standing, as the only rule by which the right of continued possession could be equitably deter mined. Applying this rule to Mohammerah, ' which had for eighty years past been virtually possessed, directly or indirectly, by Persia,' they held that the town should still remain to Persia, together with the possession of the left bank and free navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab from Mohammerah to the sea.

The late Mr. Curzon, who for a short while was associated with Colonel Williams as a British21 m Mr. Wellesley (afterwards Lord Cowley), No. 11, August 4, 1846. Sir Stratford Canning, No. S2, April 2, 1845. Commissioner at Erzeroum, has graphically described in his book 'Armenia' an episode which took place shortly after his arrival in 1842 :— I was walking up and down on the roof of the house watching the crowds passing in the valley below, and looking at the great guns of the citadel, which the soldiers were firing as a salute to the Persian Pleni potentiary. They fired very well, and in very good time; but I observed several officers and a number of men ^busily employed at one gun. At length this gun was loaded, a prodigious deal of peeping and pointing took place out of the embrasure, and, just as I was turning in my walk, bang went the gun and I was covered with dust. On looking down I saw a ball stuck in the earth : the soldiers had all disappeared from the ramparts of the citadel, and I found they had been taking a shot at the British Commissioner. Here, perhaps, was a frank token of the value set by Turkey upon the mediation of Great Britain and Russia. The resumption of work at Erzeroum, which did not take place till 1846, was marked by a similar incident of well-nigh fatal import to further treaty negotiations : the house of Mirza Takki, the Persian Plenipotentiary, was besieged and pillaged by a fanatical mob of Sunnis ; an assault was made upon his person and he was compelled to defend himself for many hours, Colonel Williams risking his life in the affray while the Turkish authorities remained inactive; and, finally, two members of the Mirza's suite were murdered. Many months elapsed before the Sultan was at length impelled to appease the outraged Envoy with a peace-offering of 15,000 purses. # In March, 1845, Sir Stratford Canning was able to join with his Russian colleague in recommending to the Sublime Porte a basis for settlement, by advising the total abandonment of claims for indemnity, and, in regard to Mohammerah, the surrender to Persia of the island of El Khizr (Abadan), and of so much of the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab as was occupied by tribes recognised de facto as dependent on Persia, as well as the grant to her of full freedom of navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab up to the point of contact of the two frontiers. Sir S. Canning anticipated that the Turkish 8,000/. [2440 c—10] G22 objections to the proposals about Moliammerah would not be easily overcome: this forecast proved correct. A treaty was eventually signed at Erzeroum in 1847 : but the settlement was onlv one in s i r Kembalh * {Verbatim.) semblance, as, before consenting to the con clusion even of the Preliminary Treaty, the Porte required that assurances should be given to it as to the meaning of some of the articles, and made conformity with its views on the part of Persia indispensable to its acceptance of the proposed engagement. After considerable negotiations, in which the Cowley, 0 ' No. 179, Persian Government, or its agents, took no part, June 2, 1847. it was arranged, with a view to secure the pre liminary signature of the Treaty, that the desired assurances should be given in writing by the representatives of the two mediating Governments at Constantinople; and, as a further precaution against their rejection by the Persian Com missioner on the spot, and his consequent refusal to sign the Treaty, it was determined to keep him in ignorance of the arrangement. It was hoped, indeed, that the Treaty once signed, the Persian Government would be readily induced to indorse these ' assurances,' or, if not so induced, it was argued, the Persian Government might still, if it pleased, decline to ratify the Treaty. •/ The Porte for the nonce accepted this com promise, but at the same time declared emphati cally that, if the Persian Government did not adopt the assurances, the Treaty must be con sidered nul et non avenu. Under these circumstances, tbe Treaty was signed. The assurances in question did not, however. Colonel Sheil, meet with the concurrence of the Persian Govern- 1 g4 7i ment. Fearing some covert object which it could not comprehend, it persisted in its dissent from them to the liepresentatives of the mediating Governments at Tehran, and the course it deter mined to pursue, without refusing to ratify the Treaty, was simply to ignore them. Its Pleni- Lord^owley, potentiary, therefore, acting presumably on the February 2; tacit recognition by all parties of the views of his 16)1848&gt; Government, declined to exchange ratifications Lord Hioomfield, if the ratifications of the Porte were to be coupled No. 34, . e , February 2o, 1848. with arriere-pensees as to the import ot the To Lord Cowley, Treaty; but, yielding eventually to extreme No. 38, , , i. * i i March 15, 1848. pressure exercised by the mediating Ambassadors23 Lord Cowley, No. 108, March 17, 1848. Lord Cowley, No. 115, March 21, 1848. as the sole means of preventing failure, lie with drew his objections, and, protesting, the while, w r ant of authority, acceded as required to the demands of the Porte in the form of an official note addressed to the mediating Representatives. It was still with the greatest difficulty, and ostensibly as a matter of favour to the British Government, that the Porte expressed itself satisfied with this issue; nor did it then consent to ratify the Treaty without requiring and obtaining from the representatives of the mediat ing Governments an 'Explanatory Note,' em bodying in a more formal manner the assurances they had previously given. Thus was the Treaty ratified at Constantinople in March 1848. The effect of these transactions was to render the work of delimitation impossible, and, after more than two years wasted in barren discussions, to restrict the labours of the Frontier Commission (composed of Turkish, Persian, British, and Russian Delegates), which was now appointed, to the mere acquisition of topographical and statistical information. In order to appreciate the extent to which the ' Explanatory Note' affected the terms of the Treaty, and the conflict of pretensions which ensued, it is necessary to contrast the provisions of either instrument, in so far as they refer to Mohammerah. The following are the Treaty stipulations:— Article 2 (Extract). The Ottoman Governraent formally undertakes that the town and port of Mohammerah, the island of El Khizr, the anchorage place, and the lands on the eastern, that is the left, bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, which are in possession of tribes recognised as subject to Persia, shall be in possession of the Persian Govern ment in full sovereignty. Besides this, Persian vessels shall have the right to navigate in full liberty the Shatt-el-Arab from the place where it enters the sea to the point of junction of the frontiers of the two parties. Article 8 (Extract). The two high Powers will leave once for all, to the free-will of the tribes, whose suzerain is unknown and concerning whom there is a dispute, the right to choose and designate the places where they will henceforward always reside; and it is agreed that the tribes whose allegiance is known will be forced to return to the territory of the State to which they belong.(This is an exact facsimile of the diagram enclosed by Colonel Williams in his despatch of February 4th, 1850. The red line indicates the Mediating Commrs.' proposal, the green one the Turkish claim, which did not, however, include Mohammerah town or El Hiszah island, and the blue one the Persian claim, which, according to the journal of the second conference of Mohammerah, should nevertheless have been drawn in mid-channel while following the Shatt-el-Arab. A. P., April, 1912.) JVor-t h .25 late Her Majesty's Consul at Bagdad, who happens to be here, has confirmed this statement. But this is a question which must be left to the decision of the commission. It is clear, then, that the Explanatory Note refers in particular to those very lands on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, above Moham- merah, which Lieutenant Wilson and the British Resident in the Persian Gulf wish now that His Majesty's Government should claim, at all events in part, as being within the territorial limits of the present Sheikh of Mohammerah ; in other words, that His Majesty's Government should now deny to Turkey possession of those very lands which it was the primary object of the Explanatory Note to secure to her. Whether or not there are factors tending to justify, or even to excuse, such an attitude on the part of Jlis Majesty's Government will be reserved for discussion in the final part of this memorandum.

(C).— The attempt of the Mediating Powers to de marcate the frontier in accordance with the Treaty. Period 1850-52. Owing to various delays the Delimitation Commissioners did not assemble at Mohammerah, to start operations, till January 1650. The British Commissioner was again Colonel Williams; the Russian was Colonel TchirikofT, who subse quently published a book giving his experiences ; and the Ottoman and Persian Commissioners were respectively Dervish Pasha and Mirza Jaffer Khan. The Ottoman Commissioner at the outset pro ceeded to allege proofs of ancient Ottoman suzerainty over the tribes in possession near Mohammerah, and recorded his claim to all the country indicated within the green line traced on the annexed map, with the exception only of the walled town of Mohammerah and the island of El Khizr. In most lawyer-like maimer he argued, like Portia in the ' Merchant of Venice ':— This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood; The words expressly are, a pound of tiesh. Then take thy bond,—take thou the pound of flesh. According to the letter of the Treaty, he was content to deliver up the walled town and the [2440 c—10] flisland of 111 Khizr, but not an inch of the sur rounding territory. He claimed, in fact, not only all the territory immediately surrounding the town of Moham- merah, hut also the extensive country to the east of the island of El Khizr, and he justified his demand by the terms of the Explanatory Note, though, in point of fact, that document was intended by its authors merely to refer to lands above Mohammerah on the Shatt-el-Arab. As an offset to these exorbitant demands, the Persian Commissioner put in his claim as indi cated by the blue line on the same map, on the ground that the country so defined was actually occupied, and had been occupied for untold years, by Persian tribes. The Mediating Commissioners pointed to the terms of the Treaty as being obviously opposed to the isolation of strips of territory belonging to either State within the limits of the other, involving, as it would, the absurdity of a triple boundary to each. Colonel Williams, in a despatch dated the Enclosure 1 in _ , ,, , n n , Sir Stratford 4th Eebruary, ISoO, reported as follows to canning's No. 110, Sir Stratford Canning : — March 31,1850. Without discussing, in conference, the merits ot the explanatory note upon which the Porte founds its pretensions, we have sufficiently marked our estimation of it, by the line drawn for the future boundary; my colleague and myself believe that the note has had an interpretation put on it by the Porte which was never contemplated by the parties who drew it up ; its object, as 1 understood at the time, teas to calm the suspicions of the Divan relative to Persian pretensions towards Korna on the Shatt-el-Arab With reference to the line decided on by my colleague and myself for the consideration of Your Excellency and M. de Titow, we have arrived at that conclusion after a careful inspection of the Shatt-el- Arab and the waters flowing into it whilst on board the ' Nitocris' steamer, Avhere we were fortunate in having the practical knowledge of Captain Jones, her commander ; and, in combating Turkish pretensions to the east of Mohammerah and the island of El Khizr, we have carefully abstained from admitting Persian claims to the islands in the Shatt-el-Arab, all of which lie to the west of those two places :— The enclosed diagram will, I trust, demonstrate the justice of our award. Beginning from the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab, the proposed line (marked in red) runs along the western bank of the island of El Ivhizr, crosses the mouth of the HafFar Canal, and then up the Shatt-el-Arab to the mouth of the Abu Djudei Canal, a distance of a geographical league [it is27 To Lord Bloomfield, No. 256, July 12, 1850.

P.] from the Haffar; and thence in as straight a line as circumstances will admit of to the town and district of Hawiza, passing through the towers named by Dervish Pasha. The Persian pretensions are marked in blue, while those of the Porte will be found traced in green. In this diagram 1 have omitted the dotted lines which mark the ' supposed frontier' in the skeleton charts in the possession of your Excellency and the Foreign Office; and I do this to prevent confusion which a number of traces would cause on a diagram which by necessity is so small. Thus we offer to Persia a free entrance to, and security in, her port of Mohammerah, at the same time ensuring to Turkey the navigation of the Shatt-el- Arab by the destruction of the fort (at Feylieh) built by Sheikh Jabir during the conferences of Erzeroum Colonel Williams referred too to the wish of Dervish Pasha for the retention of this fort by the Turks, hut he and his colleague deemed its destruction indispensable.* In the same despatch Colonel Williams ex pressed the view that any other line which the Mediating Commissioners might have proposed would have failed in producing the desired results. Her Majesty's Government and the Russian Government pronounced in favour of the line of the Mediating Commissioners. Hie Persian Government, while disposed to forgo its own pretensions, maintained that the line proposed by the Mediating Commissioners ought to be drawn at a place 4 or G miles to the west of Failieh, near a place called Tamar higher up the Shatt-el-Arab, the argument being that a portion of the Chaab resided ou, and was in actual possession of, the land up to the above spot, if not beyond it. Declaration, dated January 31, 1848, of Persian envoy at Constantinople. * As bearing on this point, it should be mentioned that, Turkey having raised the question, the Persian envoy had written in January 1848 to the British and Russian repre sentatives at Constantinople as follows ;— ' Sa Majeste le Schah consent a ce qu'aussi longtemps que la Turquie ne batira point de fortifications sur la rive droite du Chatt-el-Arab, situee vis-a-vis du territoire persan, la Perse a son tour s'abstiendra d'en construire sur la partie de la rive gauche qui lui revient selon les stipulations du traite.' Mohammerah town was excluded from this prohibition.28 Colonel Sheil, thou^li considering the argu ments of the Persian Government to be in the main well-founded, observed that, on the whole, the advantage and justice of the decision of the Mediating Commissioners seemed so obvious that he had no hesitation in pressing its acceptance on the Persian Government. The Persian Government eventually accepted Colonel Sheil to the delimitation of the frontier according to the opinion of the Mediating Commissioners, but on condition that the portion of the tribe of Chaab to the west of their line of demarcation should be transferred to Persia. That portion was by the Persian Government estimated at 20,000 souls, and by Colonel Sheil at a smaller number. With reference to this condition, Colonel Colonel Williams Williams furnished some additional information ^ptel^ 1 ^ 1 ^ S l7^ ll, as to the motives for the decision of the iSoO. Mediating Commissioners ; and, inasmuch as the lands in question lie between the 1850 line (that of the Mediating Commissioners) and the boundary as locally observed at the present time (1912) I venture to quote the following passage :— The decision we (the Mediating Commissioners) came to on the point of departure from the Sbatt-el- Arab was founded on a geographical point unknown to (^ ee map at p. 2o.) those who framed the Treaty of Erzeroum (1848), and which was clearly stated in the protocols drawn up at Moharnmerah, viz., that the large channel on the west side of the island, opposite to Sheikh Jabir s fort at Failieh, marked in Colonel Chesney s maps as the channel of navigation from the sea with Bussorah, is now closed except to small boats, and that at the present moment all the traders bound to Bussorah are obliged to take the narrow channel to the east ot the island in question, which forces them under the musketry of the fort in question. If, therefore, we had gone up the river twelve miles, the point to which individuals of the Chaab tribe have crept (1 believe in very recent times), we should have placed the port of Bussorah at the mercy of this not very sciupulous Arab tribe, and thus, in placing Persia in the possession of her desired port and anchorage of Mohammerah, we should have denied to the opposite party the same security for its port and city of Bussorah. I can see no reason why the Chaab about t ailieh should not, if they like, rejoin their clan; for they do not come under even doubtful allegiance, being a portion of the Chaab or Persian tribe. These reasons Colonel Sheil urged upon the Colonel^ Sheil, Persian Government as conclusive | the equal December 18, protection of access to Mohammerah and Bussorah 18o() -being the object of the Mediating Commissioners, it was represented that any other line would have brought the trade of one of the above towns under the control of a rival Power. As regarded the portion of the Chaab tribe remaining to the westward of the Mediating Commissioners' line, these families did not belong to wandering tribes, living in tents, without any fixed property ; they resided in villages, and were said to be owners of property of some value, particularly in date groves. Their compulsory removal would therefore be a measure of great harshness, which the Mediating Governments could never reconcile with the dictates of justice and humanity. It was therefore proposed by Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran to leave the expatriated portion of the tribe where it was, and to compensate Persia in some other shape for the loss she would suffer. The Ottoman Commissioner and the Sublime Porte absolutely rejected the line of the M ediating Commissioners; and it was agreed, but as a purely provisional arrangement, and expressly pending a final adjustment, to accept the status quo and to proceed with the work of delimitation further north : but a long wrangle took place as to what was the status quo, and nothing precise was generally accepted. [2440 c—10] 131 India Office. June 3, 1911. Part III.— Conclusion. There are two principal points involved in this question, namely, at what place should the boundary he made to strike oft* from the Shatt- el-Arab, and, until it does strike off from the course of that river, should it be drawn in mid- channel, or should it be drawn along the left (eastern) bank. As explained in part I of this memorandum, the British Hesident in the Persian Gulf and Lieutenant Wilson, who was Acting Consul for Arabistan, have urged that the boundary should be made to strike off from the Shatt-el-Arab at a place more advantageous to Persia (and the Sheikh of Mohammerah) than a line recom mended by the Biitish and Hussian Mediating Commissioners in 1850, and they have also urged that the boundary should, so long as it follows the course of that river, be drawn in mid- channel, and not along the left (Persian) bank as recommended by the Mediating Commissioners. In support of this point of view they advance, amongst other reasons, the argument of long- established usage. The India Office, on reconsideration, supported the views of these Officers in a letter, dated June 1911, from which extracts follow :— In so far as concerns the wording of the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), the Earl of Crewe recognises that it might be taken to imply the right of Turkey to control the Shatt-el-Arab from bank to bank, subject only to free liberty being accorded to Persia to navigate it. This view might find support in the suggestions of the mediating commissioners in 1850, regarding the boundary in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. In this connection I am to solicit reference to the corre spondence ending with this Office letter of the 26th August, 1910, and to say that the Earl of Crewe does not altogether share the opinion of his predecessor on the question therein discussed. That the Turks are in possession of the commissioners' map, which would appear to assign to them the whole river, is undoubtedly inconvenient, as is also the circumstance that the two Pow T ers pressed the Porte in 1850 to accept the com missioners' line. But the Porte declined to do so, and in his Lordship's opinion the situation thus created must be held to be governed by the communication made to them in 18(59, when the representatives of the Powers handed in a map on which no line at all was drawn. This identic map seems to have been the32 basis of all subsequent discussions, and Lord Crewe sees no reason for going behind it, or for permitting the Turks to go behind it, to an earlier map, which their own ill-judged action had caused to be superseded. It might further be pointed out to the Turkish Govern ment, if necessary, that by their rejection of the line proposed in 1850 they have allowed a situation to grow for sixty years in which mid-channel has, without challenge, been accepted by local usage as the boundary, and that this is consequently the status quo on the observance of which His Majesty's Government must insist. As regards the approaches to the Shatt-el-Arab, as distinct from the channel, there may be presumed to be no question but that Turkish and Persian rights are regulated by general considerations of international law, instead of exceptional treaty stipulations. {Subject, therefore, to any observations of Secretary Sir E. Grey, Lord Crewe does not consider that, as between Turkey and Persia, the case presents any special difficulty. . . .* With the last paragraph of the above extract this memorandum is not primarily concerned. I propose to deal firstly with the question of the point where the boundary should leave the river, and secondly with the question of whether, while following the course of the river, it should be traced in mid-channel or on the Persian hank. It will be noticed that the India Office admits, in the above letter, that it is somewhat incon venient that Turkey is in possession of a copy of the map of 1850, and also that Great Britain and Prussia urged her to accept the Mediating Com missioners' line. But the arguments advanced are, first, that the Mediating Commissioners' line of 1850 was cancelled and superseded by thecom- municaiion made some twenty years or so later that the boundary would be found somewhere within the limits of a certain zone about 40 miles in width ; and, second, that His Majesty's Government might, if necessary, point out to Turkey that a different boundary to that pro posed in 1850 had, as a matter of fact, been locally observed without challenge for sixty years-, and that this consequently is the status quo on the observance of which His Majesty's Govern ment must now insist. * The India Office letter was written before the proposal for a i eference of the Turco-Persian frontier dispute to The Hague Tribunal had been finally adopted. My memorandum refers to the questions involved not so much from the point of diplomatic negotiation as from what seems likely to be the purely legal standpoint.—A. P33 For facility of reference, the first argument may be designated that of the zone, and the second that of the status quo. It may also he remarked here that the two lines of frontier, that of the Mediating Commissioners and the one locally recognised, are, at the point where they leave the river, about 6J miles apart, and that both are within the limits of the above-mentioned zone. The argument of the India Office that the Mediating Commissioners' line has been can celled is based on what took place subsequent to 1850, the diplomatic transactions prior to that date being altogether ignored. Now the Mediating Commissioners proposed a line at another point on the frontier, in the district of Zohab, much further north ; and it may, perhaps, be conceded that, in regard to the line drawn at Zohab, the recommendation of the Mediating Commissioners has been superseded by the communication made some twenty years later that the boundary would be found somewhere within the zone 40 miles wide. Be this as it may, the case of the line recom mended by the Mediating Commissioners in the Mohammerah district is essentially different, owing to the special negotiations which took place in regard to that particular district before the Mediating Commissioners proposed their line in ] 850. These antecedent negotiations were succinctly as follows:—• Article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) contained a clause providing that ' the town and port of Mohammerah, the island of El Khizr, the anchorage place, and the lands on the eastern, that is the left, bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, which are in possession of tribes recognised as subject to Persia, shall be in possession of the Persian Government in full sovereignty. Besides this, Persian vessels shall have the right to navigate in full liberty the Shatt-el-Arab from the place where it enters the sea to the point of junction of the frontiers of the two parties.' Before signing this treaty, Turkey insisted on receiving assurances inter alia as to the meaning of the above provision, and, before she would ratify it, she required that the Persian Envoy at Constantinople should accept them formally, which he did in a written note and 'in virtue [2440 c—10] K3A of the mission entrusted to him by liis Govern ment,' and that the British and Russian Representatives should embody tbem in an ' Explanatory Note.' One of these assurances was to the effect that, beyond the places specifically named in the treaty, Turkey did not cede in the Mohammerah district any lands or ports. Another of the assurances was to the elfect that Persia could not in any case put forward a valid claim to lands situated on the right bank of the Shatt-el-xirab, nor to lands belonging to Turkey on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, even if those lands were occupied in whole or in part by Persian tribes. The upshot of all this seems to be that the treaty allotted to Persia such lands on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab as were in possession of Persian tribes : the Explanatory Note,' or assurances, provided explicitly that the mere fact of occupation by Persian tribes did not, per ac propter se, and in the absence of some territorial right of ownership, confer upon Persia a valid claim. There were certain lands, above Mohammerah and on the left side of the Shatt-el-Arab, which were cultivated and dwelt upon by Persian tribes; but Turkey maintained that rent for such lands was paid to the Government of Bussorah ; and that they were accordingly Turkish territory. The British Ptepresentative at Constantinople, Mr. Wellesley (afterwards Lord in commenting on the assurances subsequently Cowley), No. 115, embodied in the 'Explanatory Note,' asserted, April 2,184/. in a despatch to Lord Palmerston, that they were nothing more than a repetition of what was already in the treaty. 'We have' he wrote, ' not specified which is Turkish territory : we have merely declared that what is Turkish territory is to remain so; but it will be the business of the Commission to be appointed hereafter to settle the exact spot where Turkish property ends and Persian begins.' (It may be thought that Lord Cowley was rash in stating that the ' Explanatory Note ' was a mere repetition of what was in the treaty: indeed Sir S. Canning, who had been absent at the time it was drawn up, was compelled to admit that the terms of it, taken literally, did imply a limitation of the treaty which it was equally difficult to reject on clear grounds of right, or to admit with any degree of satisfaction ;35 but he added that the note, being of an explana tory character, could not be supposed to change the very nature of the treaty, as contended by Turkey. The primary object of the explanations Mr. Wellesley given was, according to Lord Cowley's own Cowley), 1 N S o L 48 d account, to reassure the Porte on two points : February 3, 1847. jt wished to have the anchorage ground of Mohammerah more accurately defined, and it Avas apprehensive that, under the wording of article 2 of the treaty, it risked losing a large portion of territory if it were to be inferred that territory was to be given over to Persia merely because it w r as occupied by tribes calling them selves Persian.) First and Second Now w r hen the Delimitation Commission did Mohammerah! meet at Mohammerah in 1850, both the Persian i85o ary 28 ^ 29 ' an ^ ^ ie ^rkish Delegates put forward extravagant Enclosures 2 and 3 claims; the latter based his claims on the CanuL^No^iO ' Explanatory Note,' while the former declined March 30, 1850. to be bound by anything but the Treaty, con tending that the Persian Envoy at Constantinople had acted without authority in adhering to the 'Explanatory Note': the Mediating Commis sioners recommended a line w r hich Persia accepted conditionally, and Turkey rejected altogether. The line proposed by the Mediating Com missioners is important, inasmuch as it represents, except in so far as proof may be adduced to the contrary, what w r as the conclusion of the Mediating Commissioners on the important question of where, in the year 1850, Persian territory ended and Turkish territory began. In other words, it was the impartial interpretation, and practical application of the terms of the Treaty of Erzeroum,and of the 'Explanatory Note' by the Mediating Commissioners on the spot. 'Whatever arguments may be adduced in favour of the abandonment by His Majesty's Govern ment of the line proposed by their own Com missioner in 1850, and in favour of their support of a line less advantageous to Turkey, there seems little reason to expect that the Uague Tribunal, whose award must expressly be based on the Treaty of Erzeroum, will readily set aside such leading evidence. His Majesty's Government have cordially supported the proposal for submitting the Turco-Persian frontier dispute to the Hague Tribunal; and since Turkey, in negotiating last year for a reference to the Hague, laid special emphasis upon the diplomatic correspondencewLicli passed at the time of tlie Treaty of Erzeroum—a correspondence which relates, in particular, to Mohammerah—a refusal on the part of His Majesty's Government now to countenance a reference of the Mohammerah question to the Hague, or to abide by an adverse award, would he an attitude perhaps difficult to justify as wholly consistent. The argument advanced by the India Office that the Mediating Commissioners' line cannot now be appealed to, owing to events which have subsequently taken place, seems therefore diffi cult, if not impossible, to sustain as a purely judicial proposition, so long as that line stands out as a strict interpretation of the Treaty of 1847 and the ' Explanatory Note,' or indeed merelv of the former instrument alone. It would seem to follow that what I have termed the 'zone'' argument in the India Office letter is unlikely to prevail before the Hague Tribunal unless the authority of the Mediating Commis sioners' line can be undermined by a clear and convincing demonstration that it was not in point of fact a strict interpretation of the express terms, as distinct from the supposed object, of the Treaty and the Explanatory Note.' It is therefore desirable to examine the motives which determined the line recommended by the Mediating Commissioners : before doing so, it will not be out of place to remark that Turkey had claimed every inch of territory above the actual town of Mohammerah, while Persia had claimed the whole left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab above Mohammerah (the Haffar Channel) to a point some twenty miles or so above Bussorah. The independent evidence at the disposal of the Mediating Commissioners had been furnished in the main by Major Kawlinson and his pre decessor at Bagdad: they had both indicated that the lands on the left bank of the Shatt-el- Arab above Mohammerah were, for the most part, laid out in gardens and date groves dependent on Bussorah, and Major llawlinson had, after a care ful inspection, reported in 1844 that about three miles of territory above Mohammerah (thellafTar Channel) was dependent on Persia, that then for four miles there was land inhabited by a Persian tribe (the Chaabces) but paying revenue to Turkey, and thence right into Bussorah the entire territory was possessed by Turkish tribes.Colonel Williams to Colonel Sheil, September 17, 1850. Colonel Sheil (Tehran), No. 35, March 25, 1850. Colonel Sheil to Colonel Williams, June 27, 1850. Before Colonel Williams left Constantinople in 1849 to delimit the frontier, he bad prepared a map embracing the supposed line of the whole frontier from the Persian Gulf to Mount Ararat according to the treaty, and, he wrote, that portion of the line in the vicinity of Mobam- merab I presume to be a near approximation to truth.' The line in this map of 1849 leaves the Shatt-el-Arab at a point 5J miles or so above the HafPar Channel (Mobammerah) : that actually proposed by the Mediating Com missioners in 1850 left the Sbatt-el-Arab at a point about 2J miles above the HafFar Channel, It is not quite clear why Colonel Williams had selected 5^ miles above the Haffar Channel as the point whence to start his line in the map be bad prepared in 1849 ; but the reason why the Mediating Commissioners eventually, in 3 850, selected a place 2|- instead of 5^ miles above the Haffar Channel was that they apprehended danger to navigation for Bussorah if a certain fort, built by the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and the land in its immediate neighbourhood, were left to Persia. This decision gave rise to a protest from Persia, who claimed that the frontier ought at least to have started from a place four or six miles further up the river, on the ground that it was in actual possession of a tribe dependent on Persia. The Persian Government eventually accepted, how ever, the line proposed by the Mediating Com missioners, on condition that the Persian tribesmen outside the Mediating Commissioners' line for a distance of six miles or so should be transferred to Persia; but as this condition was considered impossible of execution, it was sought to give Persia compensation in another direction : this compensation was after wards awarded to her by the line proposed by the Mediating Commissioners at Zohab, and although the line at Zobab was never accepted by Turkey any more than the Mediating Commissioners' line at Mohammerah, Persia does, in point of fact, still hold the land near Zohab allotted to her by the Mediating Commis sioners, and apparently a good deal more besides. It appears that, if Turkey should now claim the frontier line proposed by the Mediating Com missioners at Mohammerab on the ground that [2440 c-10] L38 it is more advantageous to lier than the one she now holds by usage, we can furnish Persia with an argument Avhieh would carry weight with the Hague Tribunal: w T e can point to the protocols of the conferences held at Mohammerah in 1850 and, without going too precisely into distances, we can represent that the decision of the Mediating Commissioners was influenced by a very laudable consideration—the security of navigation to Bussorah—but one which was not enjoined expi*essis verbis in either the treaty or the 'Explanatory Note'; that therefore the line of the Mediating Commissioners cannot wholly and in its entire length be regarded as the precise interpretation of the treaty; that the failure of Turkey to accept the line proposed by the Mediating Commissioners, and the consequent control by the Sheikh of Mohammerah of land which was to be allotted to Turkey, has served to demonstrate, during a period of sixty years, that the apprehensions of the Mediating Commissioners as to a possible danger to shipping for Bussorah were unfounded; and, finally, that the Persian Court as early as 1850 protested against the ruling of the Mediating Commissioners on the ground that the Chaabees, its subjects, not only resided on, but were in actual territorial possession of, the land almost up to what is now (1912) locally recognised as the frontier (though, on the impartial evidence of Major Ilawlinson, it can hardly be said that their claim to it all was very strong!); and that, in view of all this, the only frontier which, in strict accordance with treaty stipulation, can be regarded as the correct one is that locally recognised, which leaves the river six miles or so to the westward of the line of the Mediating Commissioners. These are the difficulties involved in the ' zone ' argument of the India Office letter ; the other argument advanced, that of the status quo, w r iil also appear, on closer scrutiny, to be hedged round with perplexing and exceptional limita tions. Nothing seems simpler at first sight and more The equitable than the argument that 60 years or ,Uc&gt;l more of continued occupation and unchallenged administration should confer a right to territory; and the argument appears still more convincing when it is shown that the frontier enclosing such territory has been de facto tacitly accepted by the39 local authorities on both sides for a similar period of time. 45 When the line proposed in 1850 by the Mediating Commissioners in the Mohammerah district was rejected by the Porte, it was with the utmost difficulty that the Ottoman and Persian Governments were induced to accept, for the nonce, the actual status quo, —as to the definition of which there was every conceivable disagree ment,—and allow the Commission to proceed with its work further north. This arrangement was, however, ultimately accepted in 1851 in writing, but with the most explicit reservations that it was provisional, and merely pending a final settlement. As is well known, no final settlement has ever been reached ; but in 1869 an incident arose in regard to another portion of the frontier, and a formal Convention was concluded between Turkey and Persia, in that year, providing that:— Le reglement du statu quo, qui a ^te adopte de part 6t d'autre lors de I'enquete des Commissaires des quatre Gouvernements au sujet des lieux litigieux des frontieres, doit etre maintenu tel quel jusqu'a une delimitation definitive . . . (Article 2.) .... L'administration ne sera point pr^value comme de droit et lesdits lieux litigieux ne seraient aucune- ment par cela consid^res des proprietis acquises. (Article 3.) Aucune construction a I'avenir ne sera ^levee sous aucune denomination que ce soit dans les lieux en litige qui se trouvent I'administration de Tune et de I'autre partie; et toutes celles qui out eu lieu jusqu'a ce jour, aussi que toutes les marques et indices de limite, ne seront k la delimitation definitive aucunement consid^rees comme preuves de droit et de propri^te acquises (sic). (Article 4.) Cette convention provisoire sera observ^e scrupuleuse- ment jusqu'k la delimitation definitive des fronti&amp;res, sans annuler neanmoins toutes les reclamations et protestations echang^es de part et d'autre au sujet des lieux en question et des constructions y ^levees, qui toutes gardent leur effet et vigueur. (Article 7.) In the face of these explicit and formal reserva tions, it seems doubtful whether the Hague * It is said, on the authority of a confidential agent of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, that the boundary as locally re cognised was ' fixed' in 1880 by representatives of the Bussorah and Mohammerah authorities, but this statement lacks definite confirmation; the agreement may only have been verbal, and in any case it appears to have been one merely between the local authorities. ( Vide Lieutenant Wilson's precis on Arabistan, dated March 1911. p. 51.Tribunal is likely to endorse the principle of uti possidetis, especially in so far as possession only dates from, and not prior to, the Treaty of Erzeroum (1848). Now the only impartial evidence as to what ought to he considered the status quo at the date of the Treaty of Erzeroum, and of where Turkish territory ended and Persian began, is afforded by the line drawn by the Mediating Commissioners in 1850, and therefore I submit that the efforts of His Majesty's Government should be directed to the acceptance of that line as the basis of negotiation, except in so far as it can be demonstrated not to have been in strict conformity with the express terms of the Treaty: it is clear that the Mediating Commissioners made a departure irom the express terms of the Treaty when they drew the line to the east of Sheikh Jabir's fort (at Failieh) instead of a few miles to the west. If we do not adopt the Mediating Commis sioners' line, with this slight modification, as the basis of negotiation, there seems some degree of danger that Turkey may revive some of her earlier extravagant claims. It seems incon ceivable that that line should not weigh, as impartial evidence, with the Hague Tribunal to such an extent as to preclude that danger; and it accordingly appears to be to the interest of Great Britain to uphold the line except only in so far as it does demonstrably deviate from the treaty expressis verbis. So much for the hrst question—that of the precise place where the boundary should leave the river; the second question is, whether the boundary, while following the course of the river, should be traced in mid-channel or on the Persian bank. In 1844 Sir Stratford Canning wrote that the Sir Stratford Persians could not navigate any part of the November i,'isu. Shatt-el-Arab without being liable to the duties levied on shipping and merchandise by the Ottoman authorities. In the negotiations which preceded the Treaty To Lord of Erzeroum, Turkey took very great pains to Is^Feterlburgh), record her assertion of sovereign rights over the No. 256, entire waters of the Shatt-el-Arab, and, although sir Stratford 0 there is no clause in the treatv to that effect, Canning, No. 47, ^ March 19 1846* the Porte did maintain to the British and No. 51, Russian representatives at Constantinople that it only agreed to negotiate about Mohammerah on (Constantinuple), the understanding that the course of the river November 3,184641 was still to belong wholly and exclusively to Turkey, and it contended that it merely granted freedom of passage to Persian vessels in the projected treaty; and, in order to secure this right, it was required that no fortifications should be erected on any part of the river banks remain ing in the possession of Persia. Baron Brunnow, r pi ie British and Russian Governments at first February 13,184 7 Lord Bloomfield, held that the claim of Turkey to the sole sove- No , ^ teisburgll ' ) ' reignty of the Shatt-el-Arab was inadmissible, February 15,1847; and Lord Palmerston wrote earlv in 1847 to Her No 73 • * March's1 1847. Majesty's Ambassador at St. Petersburg!!:— To Lord Bloomfield, No. 45, I have to state to you, with reference to the pre- Mauh 3, 1847. tension which has been advanced by the Porte to an absolute right of sovereignty over the Shatt-el-Arab, that when the opposite banks of a river belong, as they do in the case of the lower portion of the Shatt-el- Arab, to different Powers, it would be contrary to international usage to give one of the two Powers the exclusive sovereignty of that portion of the course of such river, and that therefore this proposal of the Turkish Government seems to be inadmissible. Mr. Wellesley (Constantinople) No. 64, February 17,1847 Lord Cowley, No. 167, May 17, 1847. But this despatch of Lord Palmerston's was written before the text of the treaty, as eventually signed, had been definitely accepted, and also before the Foreign Office, in the absence of telegraphic communication, was aware of the full bearing and origin of the assurances which, at a later stage, were embodied in the 44 Explana tory Note.' The text of the relevant clause of article 2 has been given above (see p. 23): and it is clear that the Porte would not have agreed to the treaty had it anticipated that its sovereignty over the entire waters of the Shatt-el-Arab would be jeopardised ; indeed, it was probably in order to provide against such a con tingency that it requested, and received in the ' Explanatory INote,' and in a memorandum of earlier date, a more clear definition of what was meant by the anchorage place of Mohammerah. That, after the Treaty of Erzeroum had been signed and ratified, Turkey was, according to the view of the Mediating Powers, entitled to sovereignty over the entire waters of the Shatt- el-Arab, is shown by the map prepared by Colonel Williams in 1849 to indicate the modifi cations in the frontier effected by the treaty : this map draws the line not in mid-channel but on the left (Persian) bank of the Shatt-el-Arab. [2440 c—10] M42 It is true that in 1850 the Persian Commis sioner did claim medium Ji/um aqucc as against the claim of the Turkish Commissioner to sovereignty over the whole river; but the Mediating Com missioners supported the Ottoman Commissioner on this point, thereby affording evidence of the true purport of the treaty provision ; and the recommendation of the Mediating Commissioners was afterwards endorsed bv the British and * Russian Governments. The treaty secures to Persia full freedom of navigation on the lower portion of the river ; but the Porte as recently as 1911 urged that this, on the principle of construction unius expressio exclusio alterius, in itself implies Turkish owner ship of the entire waters. It would seem that the onlv consideration which «/ could be urged in favour of medium jiluni aqutE as the boundarv, is that the Bamishere Channel, which at the time of the Treaty formed an alterna tive means of access to the Karun, is now no longer navigable ; but it is a moot point how far this change would be held to modify the legal position. I assume that, if the case goes to The Hague Tribunal, Turkey might present her claim to ownership of the entire waters of the Shatt-el- Arab somewhat on the following lines ;— («) Expressum facit cessare taciturn : the treaty gave Persia freedom of navigation and, by the very fact of granting liberty to navigate, the possession by Persia of any other right is im plicitly denied. (h) In regard to territorial possession, the treaty allotted to Persia the town and port of Moham- merah, the island of El Khizr, the anchorage place, and, conditionally, certain lands on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab. But the treaty did not allot to Persia anything else in the Mohammerah district either claimed or owned by Turkey. That Turkey claimed full sovereignty over the Shatt-el-Arab was emphasised in the negotiations preceding the conclusion of the treaty; that she did own the river prior to the conclusion of the treaty is proved, Jirstiy, by the fact that the Persians could not navigate any part of it without being liable to the duties levied on shipping and merchandise by the Ottoman authorities; and.secondly, by the fact that in 1850 the Mediating Commissioners endorsed the claim advanced by the Ottoman Commissioner to exclusive ownership. As regards British interests in this matter, it will be recollected that we proposed to the Porte in July 1911, as part of the general settlement of our respective interests in the region of the Persian Gulf, that a small Commission, consist-* ing of a Turkish member, a British member, and an engineer, should be appointed to control navigation in the Shatt-el-Arab. In the infor mal negotiations which have taken place during the last few days, the Turkish delegates have intimated, on behalf of their Government, that Turkey is prepared to agree to this Commission in principle, subject to its being nominally Ottoman ; subject to a Convention being con cluded regulating, in accordance with the general requirements of shipping, all points of importance; and subject to it being definitely agreed that there should be only Turkish and British representation on the Commission. Their alleged reason for wishing the Commis sion to be nominally Ottoman was to exclude the applications which might be made for representation from inconvenient quarters if it were international. It seems then that British interests have nothing to gain from pressing the argument medium filum aqua. It is true that the Anglo-Turkish negotiations for a riverain commission may break down : but even so, the position of His Majesty's Govern ment in upholding British shipping interests would not be appreciably weakened by sacrificing the Persian claim, which in any case does not seem a strong one, to mid-channel. The conclusions to which this enquiry leads are then that His Majesty's Government would be well-advised :— 1. To urge as a general basis of nego tiation the Mediating Commissioners' line of 1850. 2. To urge the strict observance of that iine from the sea to Eailieh, thus making the frontier the left bank of Abadan Island and not the mid-channel of the Shatt-el-Arab. 3. To urge the modification of that line at Pailieh so as to include GJ miles more territoryto the west, so as to extend to the boundary as locally observed, and so as to include the palace, court-house, and prison, of the Sheikh of Mohamraerah. I would suggest that we should lay before the Russian Government these three conclusions supported by the necessary arguments; that we should propose that the two Ambassadors at Constantinople should be instructed to advise the Persian Delegates on the Turco Persian Commission now sitting to continue to press the Turkish delegates to reveal the extent of the Turkish claims near Mohammerah; that similar advice should be given by Great Britain and Russia at Tehran; and that Sir G. Lowther should be instructed to intimate in a friendly and informal manner to the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs that Ilis Majesty's Govern ment, as his Excellency is aware, attach great importance to the maintenance of the status quo at Mohammerah, as locally observed, and that they feel persuaded that the Ottoman Govern ment, who have shown such a conciliatory spirit in the negotiations now being opened in London, will take their wishes into favourable consideration. I would submit that this mode of procedure is, for the time being, preferable to a flat declaration that His Majesty's Government could not abide bv an award of the IIai?ue Tribunal if it tended to upset the status quo at Mohammerah ; and the course of action suggested associates Russia with His Majesty's Government in so far as advice to Persia is concerned, while it avoids the risk of offence which might be caused to Turkey by joint representations from Great Britain and Russia, and the consequent probability of failure. There is another important question relating to Mohammerah which is not unlikely to be discussed in the course of the present negotiations at Constantinople, and that is the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in regard to the exercise of jurisdiction over members of the Chaab tribe resident in territory on the right bank of the river, which is admittedly Turkish; but this matter is relatively less urgent, and is therefore reserved for a separate memorandum. There is also a point which I have not brought out earlier. After leaving the Shatt-el-Arab, theAt 45 boundary proposed by the Mediating Commis sioners proceeds, in as straight a line as circum stances will permit, across the desert towards Hawizah (see map opposite p. 37). Lieutenant Wilson urges that it ought to extend, according to the claims of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, Sir G. Barclay some twenty-five miles or so to the west of (Tehran), No. 169, x i September 9,1909. that town; that the irrigation system does extend to the west of that town for 1G miles; and that it is occupied by tribes tributary to the Yali of Hawizah. He represents that as the Mediating Commissioners' line bisects the territory of the Yali of Hawizah, it would be impossible for His Majesty's Government to urge it upon the Sheikh of Mohammerah or the Persian Government, the more so- since the turbulent Beni Turuf tribe would be placed partly in Turkish territory.* I submit that if His Majesty's Government procure a deviation from the Mediating Com missioners' line to the extent of 6^ miles on the Shatt-el-Arab (so as to include the Sheikh's palace, &amp;c.), they will have secured the most important point; it seems, however, altogether outside the range of practical politics to expect Turkey either willingly to abandon, or His Majesty's Government forcibly to compel her to give up, such an extensive district to the west of the Mediating Commissioners' line in the north ; the Sheikh of Mohammerah, moreover, already has to a certain extent under his control a number of tribesmen, believed to aggregate 75,000, on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab in what is incontestably Turkish territory ; it is doubtful how far he is really entitled by treaty to exercise such control; but, be this as it may, if he does exercise control over his tribesmen on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, there seems no prima facie reason why those in the re'ion of Hawizah should not be on a O similar footing. There might be some difficulties of irrigation ; but they could probably be adjusted by mutual agreement. The Sheikh of Mohammerah is a wealthy * In his despatch dated May 26, 1909, Lieutenant Wilson writes that lack of exact geographical knowledge renders it impossible to lay down the limits of Ilawizah territory with certainty, but that the sheikh's claims extend ' 6 to 8 farsakhs west of Hawizah' : but in a despatch dated March 12, 1910, he writes of the frontier line as locally observed as being only some 10 miles west of Ilawizah.'—A.

[2440 c—10] N46 landowner, and much of his property is in Turkey ; but it seems most undesirable that His Majesty's Government should encourage him in a policy of gradual territorial encroachment by means of purchasing real estate. It is, moreover, important to bear in mind that the assurances conveyed in the ' Explanatory Note' were intended in part to guard against an undue extension of Persian claims to the west.

IN November 1899, when Sir H. M. Durand, Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, visited the Kamn, the Sheikh of Mohammerah, who had been anxious to obtain guarantees relative to the independence of his territories in certain eventualities, submitted a request for assurances. Sir H. M. Durand thereupon instructed Colonel Meade, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, to make a communication to him to the effect that— we cannot, of course, undertake to maintain tlie sheikh against the Persian Government, nor can we say that, if the Persian Government breaks up, we can guarantee his independence. Our Government does not, I imagine, contemplate such a contingency. But we can tell him that we consider him the most influential person in this part of the world, and we intend as far as possible to support him, believing that it is for the interest of the country that he should be strong. If ever he wants our advice we will give it. In return we expect he will help us in matters of trade and the like. As to the Customs withdrawal from Mohammerah, I will do all I can to help him. He may rely upon our good-will at all times, and upon our help whenever we can give it without ill-faith to the Persian Government.* Cn the 7th December, 1902, Sir A. Hardinge, the British Minister at Tehran, addressed a letter to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, in the course of which he stated that the British Government had authorised him lo say that— we shall protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action may be alleged, and also, so long as you remain faithful to the Shah and act in accordance with our advice, shall continue to give you our good offices and support. The full text of this note is as follows :— Sir A. Hardinge to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. (After compliments.) December 7, 1902. I write to inform you, my honoured friend, of my return to Tehran from Europe and to enquire after your health. It was a great disappointment to me that I was unable to visit you this spring, but, as you know, I was obliged to go to England instead. I hope, however, that it may be possible for me at no distant date to have the pleasure of making your personal acquaintance. T was very glad to hear from Hajji Reis-ut-Tujjar of the satisfactory arrangement concluded between you and the Department of Customs. On general grounds of policy it is very desirable that differences should as far as possible be avoided between the Persian authorities and the Arab tribes under your rule. The relations between the British and Persian Governments are ot a friendly character, and the preservation of the integrity and independence ot the Persian monarchy has for many years been one of the great objects of British policy in this part of the world. Disturbances of a nature to imperil that object would be a serious evil, and you would gain little and might endanger much by throwing off the sovereignty of the Shah. I am convinced that, under present circumstances, the Arabs, and yourself as their ruler, have every interest in cultivating good and loyal relations with the Government of Tehran, and that the latter has no desire to oppress you or curtail your authority. For this reason 1 think you acted wisely in giving up all idea of forcible resistance to the establishment of a custom-house, and in seeking rather to come, as I have from the first urged you to do, to a Iriendly understanding on the subject with the Customs Administration. Hajji Reis-ut-Tujjar asked me on your behalf to what extent you might rely on the protection of the British Government, and I told him that so long as you behaved to us, as you have done in the past, in a friendly manner, our influence would be exerted here to maintain you and your tribes in the enjoyment of your hereditary rights and customs, and to dissuade the Government of Tehran from any endeavour to diminish or interfere with them. Hajji Reis thereupon said that you were not afraid of the Persian Government itself, nor of attack iDy neighbouring tribes acting or professing to act under its orders; but that you wished to know whether we should protect you in the event of an attempt by a foreign Power to depose you or deprive your people of the rights which they at present possess. This might happen in two ways: either such a foreign Power might be at war with Persia, and might, as an enemy of the Shah, send ships to attack your district; or such a Power, pretending to be the friend of the Persian Government or to act on its behalf, might attempt, also by means of its ships, to conquer you and the Arabs. I replied that both contingencies were extremely unlikely, but il either were to arise we should, I * Enclosure in Mr. Spring-Rice No. 15, March 20, 1900.believed, interfere, provided you had acted in accordance with our advice ; and our fleet, which is the strongest of any in the Gnlf, would be employed to prevent any forcible measures against you. I stated, however, that 1 would refer these questions to the Foreign Minister of the British Government, and he has now authorised me to sny that Ave shall protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action may be alleged, and also, so long as you remain faithful to the Shah and act in accordance with our advice, «hall continue to give you our good offices and support. As I have, however, said above, I do not regard the danger—at any rate, at present—as a real one. The Persian Government desires, I am sure, as earnestly as you do, the preservation of pence in Arabistan, and the establishment of a custom-house at Mohammerah is, as I assured you last year, a fiscal, not a political, measure. It has already informed me in a friendly spirit of the conditions under which the new arrangement has been made, and the British Government has instructed me to intimate its acquiescence in them. We reserve, of course, our right to object to any further change which we may consider likely, as affecting peace and trade on the Karon, to be detrimental to our interests. 1 trust that the new an-angement may work smoothly. There will be very likely some small difficulties and friction at first, but I trust to your wisdom and judgment to deal with them prudently and patiently. Our consul has my orders to afford you all help and advice, and you may place every reliance on my friendship. You can write to me freely should you wish to do so, as well as to the Resident at Bushire. Arthur H. Hardixge. The assurances given in the foregoing letter A\ere confirmed in a further note from Sir A. Hardinge to the sheikh, dated the 21rd December, 1903. The iollowing is the text of this note :— Sir A. Hard in ge to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. (After compliments.) Your Excellency, Bagdad, December 24, 1903. I have received a telegram in reply to the one to His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from Mohammerah, after my first interview with your Excellency. Lord Lansdowne says that if, as he presumes is the case from my account of your Excellency's statement to me, the Persian Government is really attempting to repudiate the arrangement made with you last year, I am authorised to say that you are, in his opinion, justified in opposing such attempt. He instructs me to remind you of the message which he sent you last year, and to add that you may rest assured of the support of the British Government so long as you on your side observe the conditions of the arrangement made between the Persian Government and yourself. He has authorised me to point out to that Government the necessity for respecting the conditions of the arrangement on their side. I do not propose to do so until 1 hear further from you, as I think it will bo better in the interests of good relations between the Persian authorities and yourself that our intervention should not be invoked until all other means of adjusting matters directly between them and you have been exhausted. Meanwhile, I should be obliged if you would send me to Tehran, through His Majesty's resident at Bushire, a copy of the note from M. Naus, promising not to take duty on your personal imports, and any further intormatiou on the subject. I have, etc. Arthur H. Hardinge. On the 1st December, 1908, Major Cox, consul-general at Bushire and British resident in the Persian Gulf, in pursuance of instructions received from Tehran, addressed a note to the sheikh repeating the assurances previously given in 1902 bv Sir A. llardinsre and extending them to the sheikh's successors. This note was v kJ &lt;D thus worded:— Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. (After compliments.) December 1, 1008. After enquiry after your welfare and congratulations on the satisfactory conclusion of your business with the Arab tribes, I have the honour to inform you that I duly communicated to Government all that passed at the interview which I and our friend Mr. McDouall had with your Excellency on the 7th January last, and also placed before them the statement of Govern ment expenditure subsequently received from you through Mr, McDouall. The reply of His Majesty's Government reached me through His Majesty's Legation in September last, but, in view of the importance of the subject and the insecurity of the post, 1 thought it best to delay addressing you until my return to head-quarters On arrival here I learnt of your own absence in Arabistan, and have since waited for your return to Failieh. I am directed to repeat, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, the assurances given to your Excellency in the letter of His Majesty's Minister, Sir Arthur Hardinge, dated the 7th December, 1902, which is in your possession, and the terms of which I repeated to you at our49 interview above referred to, and I am then to add that His Majesty's Government now extend those assurances to your successors. I am further to point out that His Majesty's Government have engaged to respect the independence and integrity of Persia, and to explain that that undertaking involves the main tenance of the status &lt;jiio in that country, and includes the continuance of the state of autonomy which your Excellency at present enjoys. It follows from the above that any external aggression upon your Excellency would constitute an infringement of Persian integrity which is recognised by the terms of the Anglo-Russian Convention. Trusting to have an opportunity of repeating the foregoing assurances in person at an early date, I am, &amp;c, P. Z. COX, Major, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Britannic Majesty's Consxd-General for Fart, &amp;c. The amplified assurances conveyed to the sheikh in the foregoing note were further extended in a letter dated the 16th May, 1909, addressed to the sheikh by Major Cox, acting In accordance with instructions received by him. This letter was as follows;— Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. (After the usual compliments.) Mohammerah, May 16, 1900. On the 1st December, 1908, I had the honour, by the direction of His Majesty's Government, to repeat to your Excellency the assurances given you on behalf of (rovernment by his Excellency Sir Arthur Hardinge, British Minister at Tehran, in his letter of the 7th December, 1902, to your address, and to inform you that the British Government were now prepared to extend those assurances to your successors. I was further directed to explain to you that the British Government had engaged to respect the integrity and independence of Persia, and that that undertaking in itself involved the maintenance of the status qito in Persia, and thus included the continuance cf the same state of autonomy which your Excellency at present enjoys. • I was then to point out that it followed from the above that any external aggression upon your Excellency would constitute an act of infringement of that Persian integrity which has received recognition in the Anglo-Russian Convention. While expressing your thanks for these amplified assurances, you represented that they seemed to you only to safeguard you so long as Persia continued to exist as a sovereign State, and you pressed for a further assurance which would cover the contingency of Persia ceasing to exist as a sovereign State and the intervention or occupation by foreign Powers. You also expressed doubt as to whether the present assurance only provided immunity against unwarrantable encroachment on your rights by the absolute government of His Majesty the Shah, or whether it also covered prevention of similar action on the part of parliamentary government. In reply to those representations, your Excellency was informed that Great Britain and Russia being pledged to respect the integrity of Persia, the British Government were not, properly speaking, able to admit even the possibility of Persia ceasing to be a sovereign State or coming under the occupation of a foreign Power, but that in the unlikely event of such a contingency the assurances already given to your Excellency would become even more binding than before. I was further permitted to inform you that whatever change might take place in the form of government in Persia the British Government w^ere prepared to give you the same support against any encroachment on your rights as was promised to you in 1902, and 1 was authorised to add that they were now prepared to extend the application of those assurances to your ' heirs and successors.' Mr. McDouall and I have informed you that in our opinion the assurances as now extended and expressed, appear to satisfy all your requirements; but you have further requested that the words ' heirs and successors may be changed and the words ' own successive male descendants ' may be written instead; and you have gone on to express the hope that His Majesty's Govern ment will be pleased to dispel the last shadow of doubt from your mind regarding their own intentions in the future, by adding after the words ' male descendants ' as above, the words ' up to a period of 100 years ' (or if it be possible 150 years). I cannot give your Excellency any reply on this point without reference to Government, but I will lose no time in communicating to them your representations. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. Cox, Major, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In October 1910 a further communication Avas made to the sheikh with regard to the support which His Majesty's Government were prepared to afford to him in the event of any encroachment on his jurisdiction and recognised rights, or on his property in Persia, by the Persian Government or by any foreign Power. The assurances given on this occasion were not confined to the sheikh but extended to bis male descendants. They were expressed in the following notes :— [2440 c—10] O50 Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, (After compliments.) Mohammerah, October 15, liMO. I have the honour to intimate personally and in writing that I am authorised to inform your Excellency that whatever change may take place in the form of the Government of Persia, and whether it be Royalist or Nationalist, 1 lis Majesty's Government will be prepared to afford you the support necessary for obtaining a satisfactory solution in the event of any encroachment by the Persian Government on your jurisdiction and recognised rights or on your property in Persia. In like manner they will safeguard you to the best of their ability against an unprovoked attack by a foreign Power or against any encroachment by such Power on your said jurisdiction and recognised rights or on your property in Persia. These assurances are given for yourself, and are intended to extend to your male descendants so long as you and they shall not have failed to observe your obligations towards the Central Government, and shall continue to he accep/ahle to your tribesmen, to be guided by the advice of His Majesty's Government, and to maintain an attitude satisfactory to them. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf. Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. (After greeting.) Your Excellency, Mohammeroh, October 15, 1910. With reference to my official letter of to-day's date, I attach a duplicate of that letter and the assurances contained therein, with this exception, viz., that the words 'to be acceptable to your tribesmen ' are in the attached document omitted. This is sent you in response to your Excellency's request for the assurances in a form which you could, if necessary, show to the headmen of the tribes under your control. May you be preserved. Your sincere friend, P. Z. Cox. Consul-General Cox to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. ''After greeting.) Mohammerah, October 15, 1910.

P. Z. Cox, Lieutenant-Colonel, British Resident in the Persian Gulf. EDWARD PARKES. Foreign Office, April 1912. L52 APPENDIX (C). Extract from ' Layard's Early Adventures,' Vol. 2, pp. 431-439. [Edition published in London in 1887.] SOON after my return to Constantinople from my mission to the Western Provinces of European Turkey, the joint mediation offered by the English and Russian Governments to Turkey and Persia to prevent a war, which was then on the point of breaking out between them, was accepted by the two Powers. Sir Stratford Canning was thus able to carry out his intention of availing himself of the knowledge I had acquired during my travels in Mesopotamia and Khuzistan, and to employ me in the correspondence and negotiations which took place. The principal matters in dispute were certain parts of the frontiers between the two States. Persia claimed the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, or united waters of the Tigris and Euphrates, from about sixty miles of their junction with the Persian Gulf, and certain districts in the mountains of Kurdistan, which had been seized by the Turks. Since the Matamet's expedition against the sheikh of the Chaab Arabs, who had given an asylum to Mehemet Taki Khan, the Persians had occupied Mohammerah and some territory to the north of that town. This territory was claimed by the Porte, and as the Shah refused to withdraw his troops from it, the Porte was about to have recourse to Avar to enforce its claims. It ^vas already fitting out an expedition for the purpose. It was necessary for the representatives of the mediating Powers at Constantinople to make a careful investigation into the claims of the contending parties, and to propose to them for their acceptance a fair and equitable arrangement founded upon their respective rights and interests. Sir Stratford Canning entrusted me with this duty on his part. I had to examine the evidence furnished by the Porte and the Persian Government in proof of their respective pretensions, consisting of a mass of documents, maps and surveys, many o£ them of ancient date, and to prepare a scheme for the settlement of the matters in dispute, to be submitted to the British and Russian Governments for their approval before being presented to the two Powers. I took great interest in the work, which was very congenial to my tastes. The knowledge which I had acquired of the territory in dispute, and of the history and traditions of the tribes which inhabited it, proved of much use to me. I was able to prepare^a project of settlement which appeared to me just to both parties, and warranted by the proofs which they had produced in support of their respective claims. It was entirely approved by Sir Stratford Canning, and sent by him to Lord Aberdeen, to be communicated to the Russian Government.* He fully expected that he would speedily receive authority to submit it to the Porte for its acceptance. The result of my examination of the evidence and maps furnished me was that the claims of Turkey to the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab and to Mohammerah were well-founded. Persia had never exercised more than a nominal jurisdiction over the territory in dispute, the right to which had always been asserted by the Porte. The Arab tribes which inhabited it, and which were semi-independent, had, however, acknowledged at one time the supremacy of the Sultan, and at another that of the Shah. The question was further complicated by the change which had taken place in the lower part of the course of the Karun. In the early part of this century, as may be seen by maps of the time, this river discharged itself into the Persian Gulf by more than one outlet, the principal of which was known as t he Bamishere. As it rose in the mountains of Luristan, and the whole of its course was through Persian territory, it was unquestionably a Persian river, and Persia had undoubted claims to the lands on both its banks. But a canal had been cut to unite this river and the Shatt-el-Arab, known as the Haffar, a name which denoted its artificial origin, and upon its banks Mohammerah had been built by the sheikh of the Chaab Arabs. In the course of time the waters of the Karun had enlarged this canal, and through it the main body of the river was * Sir Stratford Canning No. 70, April 27, 1844.53 directed into the Shatt-el-Arab ; consequently Persia now claimed the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab below the Haffar, with the town and district of Mohammerah, as Persian territory. The original mouth of the Karun, the Bamishere, was still open and navigable, at least to vessels of moderate draught. The earlier mouths of this river to the east of the Bamishere had been gradually deserted by it, and were silted up and dry. In fact, the Karun had for centuries been forcing its way westwards until it found a convenient outlet for the principal portion of its waters through the Haffar canal into the Shatt-el-Arab. The Porte contended, not without reason, that as the Euphrates was a Turkish river, running through the dominions of the Sultan from its source, it was unjust, and against universally recognised principles, to give to Persia the control of its outlet into the sea, merely because a Persian stream had changed its course, and had invaded a territory which did not appertain to the Shah. The command of the trade and navigation of a great river, which had flowed for more than one thousand miles through Turkish territory, would thus be transferred to a Power which might, if hostile to Turkey, close that river at its mouth. The Bamishere, the Porte maintained, was the true outlet of the Karun, and might without much trouble or expense be rendered navigable to trading vessels of any size, and that consequently the possession of the entrance to the Shatt-el-Arab was in no way necessary to Persia for the water communication between the sea and the province of Khuzistan. It was further able to show r , by ancient maps and documents, that the frontiers of Persia had never reached the Euphrates, and that the whole of the delta between the mouth of that river and the Bamishere had originally belonged to Turkey. I considered the contention of the Porte just and well-founded. I consequently proposed in my scheme, as a fair compromise, that the new frontier line should be drawn through the desert country to the w T est of Hawizah, at some distance from the Shatt-el-Arab, across the Haffar, and midway down the delta to the sea. Turkey would have thus remained in possession of the banks of the Euphrates throughout the whole of its course. My suggestion, approved and adopted by Sir Stratford Canning, was submitted by Lord Aberdeen to the Russian Government, w r hich declined to accede to it, and not only upheld the claims of Persia to Mohammerah and the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab from the Haffar to the sea, but insisted upon the cession to her of territory on its east bank {i.e., left bank), which she had not even claimed, almost to the junction of the Euphrates and Tigris at Korna—thus giving her the control of the navigation of both those rivers, which form the means of communication between the sea and the south-eastern provinces of Asiatic Turkey. Lord Aberdeen, who was desirous of deferring to Russia, accepted her views and instructed Sir Stratford Canning to recommend them to the Porte. He sent for me after the arrival of Lord Aberdeen's despatch to this effect. I found him walking up and down his study, his brows knit, his thin lips compressed, and his delicate complexion scarlet with anger. Without saying a word he handed me the despatch. I read it, and remarked that I was deeply grieved to lind that Lord Aberdeen had come to a decision which, in my opinion, w r as not consistent with justice and right, and w T as not in the interests of England. He requested me to draw up an answer to Lord Aberdeen's despatch, pointing out the objections to the arrangement proposed by Russia, the injustice that would be done to the Porte, and the discredit that would fall upon England as a mediator if she showed so flagrant a spirit of partiality to Persia. I wrote the draft of a despatch in this sense, which was adopted by Sir Stratford Canning. But it failed to produce the desired effect, and nothing remained to him but to carry out the instructions he had received from Lord Aberdeen. The Porte protested against the decision of the mediating Powers, and against the sacrifice of territory it was called upon to make by it. But it was in the end compelled to yield,* in the face of the threatening insistence of England and Russia. 1 was deeply impressed with the position of Mohammerah, and its great importance to any Power having commercial and political interests in the East. It commands the entrance to the Euphrates and Tigris, which are navigable to the very heart of the Turkish dominions in Asia, and to that of the Karun, which flows through one of the richest, though one of the most neglected, provinces of Persia. These rivers are destined to become great military and trading highways. It is, consequently, to the interest of England that their mouths should not fall into the possession of a Power which might be hostile to her. Turkey having been compelled to accept the Russian project for the settlement of * In the Treaty signed at Erzeroum in 1847. [2440 c—10] Pher differences with. Persia, the next step was to appoint a commission to delineate the the new frontier between that country and Turkey, to consist of commissioners to be named by the two Powers and by the mediating Governments of England and Russia. It had been Sir Stratford Canning's intention to employ me as one of them, in recognition of the services which 1 had been able to render him, and he accordingly proposed my appointment to Lord Aberdeen. But my views on the Turco-Persian and Servian questions had not been snch as to induce the Foreign Office to look npon me with favour, and Colonel Williams, afterwards known as Sir Fenwick Williams of Kars, was selected for the office, and Mr. Robert Curzon, the author of a popular and pleasantly-written book on the monasteries of the Levant, who had accompanied Sir Stratford to Constantinople in the capacity of private secretary, was chosen as his colleague.* [Note .—I was some years afterwards named by Lord Palmerston joint commissioner with Sir Fenwick Williams, but I resigned the appointment to undertake my second expedition to Nineveh for the Trustees of the British Museum.] * Note .—The correspondence referred to in this extract did not take place til! 1844. and it was during' that year that Mr. Layard assisted Sir Stratford Caninng; but Colonel Williams and Mr. Curzon were appointed commissioners in 1843. Lord Aberdeen's objections to Mr. Layard as commissioner could not, therefore, have been based iu 1843 on the latter's views as to the Turco-Fersian question.—A. P.55 APPENDIX (D). Rough Notes mode by General William Monteith, when in Persia, on the ironlier oj lurkey and Persia. [These notes were commnuicated to tlie Foreign Office by the author in a letter dated the 18th February, 1843, and were written during the period of his employment in connection with the Turco-Persian and Russo-Persian boundary questions, previous to his departure from Persia in 1829.] SINCE the cession of the provinces of Erivan and Naktchivan (Treaty of the 22nd February, 1828), the northern frontier is very considerably diminished and admits easier adjustment with Persia, Russia having succeeded to the claims and disputes in this direction when the Treaty of Erzeroum (LS22/1823) was concluded by Mirza Mohammed Ali, one of the Ministers of Abbas Mirza, who was then Heir Apparent and entrusted by his father, the late King, with the general direction of the negotiations. 2. It was then agreed that the treaty concluded by Nadir Shah (17-16), which was based on that of Shah Ismail, # should decide the limits of the respective Empires. But as neither State, if they possessed the document in question, were willing to produce it recourse was had to grants made to the chiefs of tribes and districts to whom the charge of the frontier had been entrusted, and if these documents could have been relied on they would have afforded the fullest and most minute information, comprehending the fields and springs belonging to each tribe and district. The few that were produced tended to prove that the greater part of the frontier lands had been granted in 'teul' or personal service, the holders of which were obliged to maintain order, and protect travellers and caravans within their respective limits. 3. The Kurdish tribes within the Turkish frontier, being decidedly the most powerful, gradually encroached on the Persian lands during the civil wars which so long continued in Persia. From the accession of Agha Mohammed Khan (1794) and the union of the different provinces of Persia under one Government, it became much superior to the pashaliks of Erzeroum and Bagdad, as the Government of Constantinople left them almost entirely to their own resources. On the conclusion of the Russian war by the Treaty of Gulistan (the 21th October, 1813), both Abbas Mirza and his brother, Mohammed Ali Mirza (the latter took less part in the Russian war and earlier began to dispute with the Pasha of Bagdad), reoccupied all that was considered belonging to Persia, and followed far within the Turkish territory the tribes who had committed depredations on Persia. Turkey still continued to treat with indifference these disputes, though almost every expedition turned to their disadvantage. The districts of Kotur, Chareh Derik, Tergavar, and Mergavar, on the frontiers of Khoi and Urumia, were undoubtedly within the Persian limits, but for a long period had been held by Kurdish begs, who not only refused submission but made constant irruptions on the Persian villages. These castles were quickly captured by the regular troops of Persia, but hostilities were continued by the Kurds on the frontier, which led to Abbas Mirza's invasion of Turkey (1821) and occupation of the whole country between the Lake of Van and the range of Ararat. In the following year, the Pasha of Erzeroum, having received some reinforcements from Constantinople and assembled the whole force of his own Government, was totally routed near Zohrab Kulla, and Abbas Mirza was only prevented marching to Erzeroum by the cholera breaking out in his army and its consequent dispersion. Peace was concluded the following year (i e., 1823), and, as before mentioned, the frontier settled on the same conditions as by Nadir Shah. The only doubtful part of the Azerbaijan frontier with which I am more particularly acquainted are the precise limits of Maku and * Shah Ismail was proclaimed Shah in 1499 and died in 1523. Nadir Shah's Treaty of 1746 was based on Sultan Murad's Treaty of 1G39.56 Cbalderan with Byazud and \ an. I, however, believe it to extend from the top of ittle Ararat in tlio direction I have marked it. The districts of Kotur and Chareh may also be disputed, but I thought from the documents produced at the time as well as their situation to the east of the great range which has evidentlv been intended as the line of demarcation, they were decidedly Persian lands; they are positions ol considerable importance, commanding two principal routes into Persia,, to whom they are of more importance than to Turkey. A lofty chain of mountains forms the boundary of the remaining part of Azerbaiian and is well defined. The Turkish and Kurdish tribes within the Turkish frontier have been m the habit of pasturing their cattle within the Persian limits, but only on suiterance, for which they paid a sum of money or other valuable consideration. las always been difficult to enforce this arrangement, to evade which, as well as to resist excessive demands, has been the cause of constant disputes and bloodshed. ns was Particularly the case regarding the right of pasture on the plain of Lahiian, much frequented by the Bilbass tribe of Kurds, belonging to Ken Sanjak and subject to the liabhei chiefs of Karachulan, the most powerful and warlike of all the Kurdish btates. For the last forty years they have been in constant revolt against Turkey, and have more than once forced pashas on Bagdad; when pressed by a Turkish army they have sought the protection of Persia, but always revolted when 'the Turkish forces had retired or a true submission been exacted. 1 ho boundary here can hardly be said to be defined, and I believe was vaguely statec m the treaty as the respective limits of the Persian Kurdish State of Senna rdelan and Shaherazur or Karachulan. Both chiefs enjoy sovereign power within t len own limits, supplying troops in case of war, when thev likewise furnish some money and provisions but more as a free gift than a tax. Every new chief must be confirmed either by the Courts of Tehran or Constantinople. In Persia formerly the chiefs of Luristan and 1 ersian Arabia (Hawiza) had under the same title of vali their own princes, but were abolished by Nadir Shah, on account of their constant revolts, le tieachery of the Vali of Arabia was the principal cause of the defeat of the eisian army by the Afghans and the fall of the Suffavean dynasty (1722). They lollowed the same course with Nadir Shah, but not with like impunity. Between Kermanshah, which now includes the province of Lusiana or Luristan, tic mountains were to form the boundary, which is an imaginary line running through uncultivated or desert lands to the village of Banilla, on the Jerrah or Hawiza River, unmarked by any defined or known object. From this Persia wishes to establish a c aim to the entire possession of the Chaab Sheikh's lands, which extend to within b miles of Bussorah consequently including the important position of Mohammerah, at the junction of the Hafar Canal with the Shatt-el-Arab, and commanding the navigation rp . ia ^ t P ers i ai i Gulf of all the rivers of Mesopotamia and Lusiana, including the Jigns, Euphrates, and Karun. Sir J. McDonald (then Lieutenant McDonald) and myself were directed by Sir J. i a conn, then Minister in I ersia, to examine the country from Bushire to Dorak and ussorah, then ascend the Karun to Shuster, Dizful, and the ancient Susa, returning direct through the mountains to Shiraz. We then considered the frontier as runnino- as i have marked it, from the before-mentioned village of Banilla to the point where the Ilafar comes out of the Karun including one or both of the great islands formed by the channels of the Shatt-el-Arab and the Karun. Ihe fiist time I heard the claim to Afohammerah advanced was in 182J in consequence, I believe, of the French officers serving with Mohammed Ali Mirza having pomted out the great importance of the position and the advantage Persia would derive troin commanding the exit of so great a river navigation. it is said Kenm Khan, when obliged to relinquish Bussorah, made some efforts to retain Mohammerah. officer or trader has, I believe, traversed Persian Arabia, or gone direct from Bussorah by Hawiza to Kermanshah. The French officers who served with the 1 ersian army were employed on several expeditions in this direction, and it is said made surveys of this hitherto unknown region ; should that be the case, they wi pro oably exist m the Depot des Cartes in France. The officers in question were geneia } in the ha bit of keeping routes of all their marches in Persia, and will probably be round either in Pans or Constantinople.APPENDIX (E).

If the title of Ears is here used in its general application to the province of that name the description is altogether incorrect, not a single rivulet that rises within the frontiers of the said province finding its way to the Shat-el-Arab. The expression may, however, have a general reference to the Persian territory; and even then, the assertion that all rivers rising within that territory disembogue, like the Karun, into the Shatt-el-Arab, will require to be greatly modified—the fact is that the Kai-un itself does not dis embogue into the Shatt-el-Arab, the main body of the river finds its way by a separate channel (the Bamishere) to the sea, and is merely connected with the Shat-el-Arab by the artificial cut of the Hafar, on the right bank of which is situated the town of Mohammerah. Independently of this Hafar canal there is only one other stream which joins the Shatt. el-Arab between Korna and the sea and ttiat is the Soweib, which carries off the superfluous waters of the great Ibur of Howeizeh, a huge marshy lake, in which the river Choaspes or Kerkha and the minor streams of the Tib and Dowairej exhaust themselves, and which is also fed from the Tigris through the channel of the Had. There is much confusion in this description. The Bakh- tiari rivers descending to the south-west from the culmina ting ridges of Aosteran Koh, Miyaneh Koh, Zardeh Koh, and Mungusht fall into three distinct channels. The Dizful river to the west, the Karun in the centre, and the Tab or Jerrahi to the east. The waters of the Eeili mountains on the contrary flow on the one side into the Kerkha and form on the other side the petty streams of the Gangir, the Abi- Jestan, the Teb, and the Dowairij, which are lost in the marshy plains of Settacene. The streams of Koh Griluyeh unite and fall into the sea at Hindiyan. The river of Shuster is the Kerkha itself, and that of Bizful joins the former at Bandi-Kir, while the river of Bebahan, or which flows near Bebahan, is the main stream of the Tab or Jerralii. The general direction of these streams is south west, and the only channels by which any part of their waters join the Shatt-el-Arab are the Soweib and Hafar. It is begging the question altogether to lay it down as an axiom that the Shal t-el-Arab is the boundary between Persia and Turkey. Sultan Murad's treaty expressly names Bussorah as the Turkish limit, and under this head includes of course the acknowledged dependencies of the city which have always been the lands on either side of the Shatt-el- Arab watered by that river. The claim of Persia to Mo hammerah consists in the latter city being on the ITafar, which is now a continuation of the Karun, and not on the Shatt-el-Arab, but until the present year Persia has never received Maliyat or revenue from Mohommerah. The measured distance between Bussorah and Mohammerah by the river, which has few sinuosities, is 25 miles, and a MOHAMMERAH is situated to the east of the Shatt-el-Arab, which is formed by the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates at a village named Korna, distant 10 farsangs from Bussorah. All the rivers, great as well as small, on the confines of Fars, flow into the Shatt-el-Arab, which continues its course till it disembogues into the Persian Gulf. The Karun is one of the streams which thus unites with the Shatt el-Arab, the latter river passing Bussorah and forming, on the west, the boundary of Nejd and Arabistan. The right of Turkey to the ports which are situated on the western bank of the river is not contested, but those to the east of the Shatt-el- Arab, which forms the boundary of Fars, depend upon that province. All the rivers, great as well as small, which rise upon the borders of Fars, traverse the territory of the Bakhtiaris, of the Fili Lurs, of Karoua (?), of Koh Giluyeh, of Shuster, of Dizful, and of Beba han, and flowing towards the east ('vers rorient') disembogue into the Shatt-el-Arab and thence into the Persian Gulf, the western shore of which is formed by Arabistan and Nejd. The Gulf and the above-mentioned river divide the two conti nents, and Mohammerah becomes in consequence a part of the territory of Fars, to which province accordingly it has always paid its revenue. The distance between the latter city and Bussorah is 4 farsangs by land, by water the interval may be traversed in an hour. The port of Mohammerah is situated on the banks of the Karun, a river which in its descent from Shuster becomes first a con- * Communicated to the Foreign Office by Colonel Sheil, Iler Majesty's Minister at Tehran, in his despatch No. 41, April 16, 1844. [2440 c—10] Q58 siderable stream in the neighbourhood of the former place. A preference has been generally accorded to the waters of the Karun over those of the Tigris and Euphrates on account of their superior purity, lightness, and sweet taste. The waters of the Tigris and Euphrates are subject, it is said, to the influence of the atmosphere, becoming warm or cold according to the state of the weather, whilst those of the Karun, on the contrary, are always comparatively cool. During the great heat ot summer, indeed, the water of the Tigris and Euphrates is only drinkable during the night, whereas above the junction of the Karun with the Euphrates the former stream may boast through out the year of the peculiarly cool and agreeable flavour of its water, thf&gt; inhabitants of the country affirming that they never feel the want of ice, and acknowledging that all the best qualities of a good water are to be found united in the stream of the Karun. As Bagdad has different quarters on either side of the Tigris, so also Mohammerah is divided into two parts by the Karun. The northern quarter used to be very populous and surrounded with cultivation, and it contained also the bazaar which is now in ruins. In the southern quarter were situated a fort, with various buildings and mosques, and the popu lation was composed of Arabs of the tribe oP Keab. The parties sent periodically by the Arab sheikhs of the Keab tribe to gather in the produce of the date groves had established many depdts on the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab for storing the fruit. Sheikh Fariss, nephew of Sheikh Thamir Khan, was entrusted with the direction of the affairs of commerce, while Sheikh Jaaber acted as the political Governor of Mohammerah. Had not this countrv been under the rule of the Keab it would have arisen into great celebrity—the only draw back to its prosperity consisted in its subjection to the Arabs. It contained about 6,000 houses, which were scattered along the borders of the Karun. Persians from Shuster, Dizful, Howiezeh, Bebahan, and Kazeroon. and others emigrating from Bunder Bushire and its dependencies of Bunder-Rig, steamer at ebb title can just traverse the interval in two hours. Mohammerah is on the Hafnr Canal and not on the Korun. At ebb tide the former channel is certainly filled from the Karun, but at flood the current is reversed, and formerly the natural flow of the waters was in this direction, from west to east. On the contrary, the Karun between Wcis and Ahwaz, 100 miles above Mohammerah, is very much larger than the Ilafar at the latter place. The excellence of the waters of the Karun and Kerka, ' the drink of kings,' has been proclaimed by the consentient voice of all antiquity and attested by the result of all modern experience. There has been much geographical confusion it is true, in consequence of one river bei'g mis taken for the other, but this question of distinction or identity appears to have the least possible connection with the disputed right to Mohammerah. The name of Mohammerah certainly applied originally to the northern and southern quarters of the town on the Hafar Canal, but for the last twenty years at least it has been restricted to the northern division, the southern quarter having been designated as the Koot-el-Sheikh (the sheikhas castle) from its being the usual residence of the next heir to the chiefship of the Chaab tribe. Sheikh Jaaber, the Governor of Mohammerah, having rebelled against the chief of Fellahiah, there has been constant fighting between the inhabitants of the two towns separated by the Hafar Canal. Mohammerah being on the mainland while Koot-el-Sheikh was on an island, and thus affording greater facilities for the dispatch of merchandise into the Turkish and Persian territorv, was generally visited by traders in preference to the southern quarter. When the Chaab possessed the territory from the sea to Girdelan their storehouses for dates were no doubt established upon the Shatt-el-Arab along the entire line, but at present 1 know of no depots belonging to the tribe upon the river above the Hafar. Sheikh Jaaber being in rebellion in Mohammerah, Sheikh Fariss was sent from Fellahiah to Koot-el-Sheikh to hold him in check, they never were associated in a common government, but each ruled independently in his own quarter; Sheikh Jaaber, however, addicting himself to commerce, while Sheikh Fariss was chiefly occupied in collecting the date produce of the island of Abadan. No doubt Mohammerah possesses natural advantages of some consequence, being situated in a fertile tract im mediately between the two large navigable rivers of the Shatt-el-Arab and Karun ; but the population of the countries through which these rivers flow must be multiplied tenfold before the demand and supply can bo such as to entitle the port to bo ranked amongst the great emporia of eastern trade. Personal examination and extended enquiries enable me to state positively the following factsregarding Mohammerah. In its most flourishing state it never contained at the utmost computation above 500 houses, probably not more than 400 of these, be it observed, were almost exclusively reed huts plastered with mud; there were four caravanserais and three temporary sheds used as coffee houses. Sheikh Jaaber once brought a boat load of burnt bricks from Bussorah which he made use of in laying the foundations of hii own59 house and one of the caravanserais, and these were the only bricks that were ever known in the place, reeds and mud were the exclusive ma' erials used in the other buildings. The transit trade was no doubt flourishing at one time, but a comparison, even in the proportion of their relative extent between Mohammerah and our Indian capitals is preposterous in the extreme. As for the lakhs of gold and silver money in dai'y circulation, no one that 1 have ever conversed with bel eve it possible that t'icre could have been at any one time a lakh of rupees collected in Mohammerah. The staples of export and import were respectively dates and rice, and at all times three-fourths of the inhabitants were Arabs. This geographical description is quite unintelligible, the otal distance from the sea to Girdelan is about miles. As you ascend the river ttie isle of Abadan stretches for rabout 50 miles on the right, and this is all Cliaab territory, but quite independent of Mohammerah ; then occurs the mouth of the Hafar Canal with about a mile of territory on the Sliatt-el-Arab belonging to Mohammerah. Above you have for two miles the date groves of Buiidee, cultivated by the Chaab, but paving revenue to the Bawee Arabs, then occur for four miles the lands of Tamur inhabited by the Chaabies subject to Fellahiah, but paying revenue to Bussorah, and above that point the Muntifik and other Turkish subjects possess the entire territory for 19 miles into Bussorah. The rivalry always subsisting between the two sub divisions of the Chaab tribe, named Kdtis and Nasara, appears to have had but little effect on the condition ot Mohammerah. Hajee Jaaber was ot neither one tribe nor the other, and admitted few of them into his town; he formed and supported his own garrison, and as far as I have been able to ascertain was well and faithfully served by them. This account of the capture of Mohammerah is slrangfly perverted. Treachery was never imputed to the garrison, nor did Jaaber fly from his own people but from the Turkish soldiery. Relying in fact on support f'om Fellahiah, which was withheld by Sheikh Thamir from jealousy of bis rival's power, he rejected all overtures and determined to defend his town to the last. The place was accordingly formally invested, battered, breached, and finally taken by assault, Sheikh Jaaber escaping in his boats by the Bamishere river when the Turkish troops were occupied in plundering the town. Mohammerah was stormed on the western face, and when the troops were fairly in possession of the breach there was a general rush to the'boats on the Hafar, which runs along the southern wall of the town, and numbers of persons ■who were without the means of flight throwing themselves into the canal were drowned ; the total population of the place when it was captured, including the Arab garrison of fighting men may have been 3,000 souls, and as always occurs when a place is carried by assault, the loss of life was no doubt considerable. I have never been able, however, to collect any satisfactory information on this point, nor can I obtain an approximate estimate of the extent and value of the plundered property. Genaweh, Dilem, and Rishahan assembled at Mohammerah and built bazaars, khans, caravan serais, and coffee houses. The place became so flourishing that the rent of a single room in a caravanserai amounted to 10 kurush (ain) per mensem, a sum equivalent to fifteen Shiraz rupees, and the merchants were only too glad to secure accommodation at that exorbitant rate. Wealthy and respectable mevcha.nts in fact have certified that the condition of Mohammerah was at one time so flourishing as to rival Calcutta and Bombay, not considered in regard to its actual extent, but as being more populous and celebrated than either of the above-mentioned cities in refer ence to the space which they relatively occupied. Agha Abdul Mahommed, a merchant who visited Mohammerah before the expedition of the Pasha of Basfdad on certain commercial affairs of his own, has taken oath also that during his residence of one month in the place lakhs of gold and silver money were in daily circulation. On the eastern bank of the Shatt-el-Arab from the head of the Persian Gulf as far as Girdelan, opposite to Bussorah, the port of Mohammerah occupies to the south a space of 4 farsangs. the whole of this tract produces dates and other fruits, and it also contains within its limits fourty-four forts belonging to the Keab Arabs. Amongst the Arabs of those parts there are two particular tribes, named respectively Derissis and Ansar, who have risen into great power, and to whom is owing the ruin of Mohammerah, Jaaber having been deputed by Sheikh Thamir Khan to govern Mohammerah, appropriated to himself the entire revenues which arose from the gardens without admitt ing the Keab Arabs to any partici pation. On the arrival accordingly of the Pasha of Bagdad, and enmity having at the same time broken out between the two tribes, a project was formed for the assassination of Jaaber, who, how ever, obtaining information of the plot three days after the Pasha's arrival and before any slaughter had commenced, fled away in a boat with his family and servants. On this intelligence getting abroad, the whole population was seized with a sort of panic and cast themselves into the waters of Shatt; women and children unable to swim perished in the waves, about 4,000 souls were carried into slavery by the Arnaouts and Turkish soldiers, others saved themselves by flight. The60 Mahommedans of Bussorah purchased many of these children for 18 or 20 kurnah a-head, and restored them to their parents. From Mohammerah to the town of Fellahiah on the River Jerrahi, where the sheikhs of the Keab trihe have their residence, merchandise is con veyed in small boats named by the inhabitants ' belem ' and &lt;c shuyeh,' as well as in the large boats which navigate the Shatt-el-Arab. The distance from Mohammerah to Fellahiah amounts to 10 farsangs ; the usual method of performing the journey is in small boats upon the river, but the traveller can, if he desires, ride along the banks on horseback, being obliged, nevertheless, at two places to take his saddle and other property into a boat and cross his horse over the streams which oppose his progress by swimming. The Hiver Jerrahi, formed by the junction of three streams named respectively the Kurdistan, the Bebahan, and the Ram Hormuz, directs its course towards Fellahiah ; but before reaching that city it divides itself into five branches, two of which only pass through the place. At three different spots the lands are irrigated and devoted to a large extent of rice cultivation. The country for the space of 30 farsangs presents a very com pact (tres uni) appearance, and belongs to the Keab Arabs, who are employed in every species of agriculture. The whole territory along the course of the river is extremely fertile, the water which remains after the wants of the cultivation are supplied being carried off by a subterranean passage [ ? ]. The plain, moreover, produces a vast quantity of reeds which are both used for fuel and in the construction of all the houses that are not intended for the .sheikhs and great people. From Arkoot Mihna, a village which is situated in the district of Zeidan, containing also seven other villages and two forts named Deh Moolah and Bunder Hindonam, as far as Fellahiah, the capital of Sheikh Thamir Khan, the cultivation of corn and green vegetables (legumes) is general. Sheikh Thamir Khan's various possessions extend over a space of ten stages upon each side [ ? ] the lands being watered by the rivers Jerrahi and Zeidan, and the revenues which are realised from the cattle and pasture grounds accruing to the said sheikh. Mohammerah possesses a port which, had it not The water communication between Mohammerah and Fellahiah is by the artificial canal which connects the Jerrahi with the Karun, and the navigability of this canal by vessels of a greater or less draught depends entirely on the state of the great dyke on the Jerrahi. When this dyke is in repair belems c»n alone ascend the canal, when it is destroyed the usual river boats of the Karun can be tracked to Fellahiah. I have always understood the banks of the Fellahiah Canal to be so densely covered with reeds as to be altoget her impassable to a horseman. I do not understand how the traveller would require to- cross tw o rivers; it appears to me that between Moham merah and Fellahiah the bed of the Karun itself would form the onlj obstruction. This description of the Jerrahi is exceedingly incorrect. The Kurdistan, the Bebahan, and the Ram Hormuz are all the same, the three names being applied to the Jerrahi iu different parts of its course; the only affluent of conse quence that joins this river after leaving the mountains west of Bebahan is the united stream of the Ah Allah and Abi- Zard, which falling into the Kurdistan in the plain of Earn Hormuz forms the Jerrahi, identical with the Oroatis of the ancients and the Tab of the Arab geographers. At present two branches of tiiis river, named the Jungeri and Kolfi, leaving the mainstream a few miles above Fellahiah, unite and form the Nahr-i-Busi, which disembogues into the sea at the Khur-i-Musa, the remaining waters are divided between the Boteynaut, the Fellahiah, and theRaghiodhee, the Fellahiah passing through the town of that name and joining the Karun about 15 miles above Mohammerah, and the other two canals being consumed in the irrigation of the Cliaab lands. I have never heard of this ' souterrain,' and conclude^ therefore, the allusion to be to the mere absorption of the superfluous waters. Between the district of Zeidan, which is on the river of Hindiyan, usually named Zohreli } and formed by the united streams of the Abi-Shur and Abi-Siiirin and the rich country of Fellahiah on the Jerrahi, the interval, 50 or 60 miles in extent, is entirely desert and devoid of permanent inhabitants. It belongs to the Chaab, but is only of value for its winter pasturage. The general shape of the Chaab territory is triangular, that is, taking as a base the sea coast from the mouth of the Shat to the mouth of the Zohreh (the Brizana of antiquity), the western side will be formed by the Shat, the Hafar, and the Karun, and the eastern by the course of the Zohreh to Deh Moolah, and by an imaginary line stretching from that point to the Karun, the point of inter section of the two sides being at Weiss, which thus becomes the apex of a triangle. The extreme distance from north to south is about ICQ miles and from east to west 80 miles.61 The province of Nejd is the high plateau of Central Arabia, distant some 500 miles at its nearest point from Bussorah, and tlie name is never applied to the valley of the Euphrates, It would appear from this that Persia claims the left bank of the Shat and the Tigris as her boundary from the sea to near Bagdad, but I know not the grounds upon which the claim depends. At present she docs not possess any territory on the river above Moliammernli. Girdelan was certainly built by Persian colonists about 100 years ago and continued with the adjoining villa2 ;es subject to Howoizeh for some years after Nadir Shah's lurkish conquests; but the lands watered by the Shat from Girde lan to the sea are, nevertheless, registered in the Bussorah records as dependencies of that city from the earliest period to which such documents ascend, and all the ancient geographical notices confirm this territorial allotment. The village of Sadireh is on the Jerrahi about 40 miles above Fellahiah; the extreme Chaab possession, however, on this river is Khalafabad, 15 miles above Sadireh. The country is thinly inhabited from Khalafabad to Old Doorak, but between that point and Fellahiah the cultivation, watered by canals from the Jerrahi, continue in an un interrupted line and may be increased to any desired extent. The direction of the Jerrahi from Ram Hormuz to Fellahiah is south westerly, and from that point to the sea the Nahr-i-Busi runs due south. Bunder Maashar is on the sea near the mouth of the Nahr-i-Busi; it is distant about 30 miles from Fellahiah and nearly 70 miles from Sadireh by the river. H. RAWLINSON, Consul at Bagdad. been destroyed, would have become very cele- brated. The whole country to the west of the Shatt-el-Arab from the Persian Gulf to Girdelan opposite to Bussorah, is included in the territory of Nejd ; but Girdelan is to the east of the river, where the country, for a space of 80 farsangs, belongs to the province of Fars. Throughout all this tract the date palm flourishes, the groves in many places stretching for a space of 8 farsangs, in others being limited to 3 farsangs. Besides dates the country also, which belongs exclusively to Sheikh Thamir Khan, produces oranges, citrons, figs, grapes, pomegranates, plums, peaches, &amp;c. The Keab tribes of Edres and Ansar occupy the gardens on the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab. the eastern shores of which are held to be an integral part of the territory of Fars. There are forty-six forts which acknowledge the rule of the Keab Arabs. The houses which are built within these forts and around them are constructed of earth, of bricks, and of the wood of the date tree ; the buildings and edifices which surround the gardens are inhabited by the Keab subjects who are employed in gathering in the fruit. As for the rice and corn, of which the produce is very con siderable, the sheikh enjoys the entire revenues. The village of Sadireh, which is situated at the distance of 8 farsangs from Fellahiah, is one of the dependencies of the Sheikh, it may be reached either by land or by water. Agents are maintained there by the chiefs to superintend the cultivation of the wheat and barlev. The families occupied in husbandry amount to about 200. The water for irrigation comes from the Jerrahi which runs easterly ' vers I'orient' towards Fellahieh. Mnashar occurs at the distance ot 4 farsangs from Sadireh. [2440 c—10]64 Translation of the New Treaty of Erzeroum (1847). (Made by Mr. Redhouse at Erzeroum.) Article 1. THE two Mussulman States agree to abandon totally the pecuniary claims of both parties which they have hitherto been raising against each other. But no invalidity shall acme from this agreement to the convention contained in the fourth article for the settlement of particular claims. Article 2. The State of Persia undertakes that all the level lands of the province of Zohaub r i.e., the lauds of the western part of it, shall be abandoned to the State of Turkey. The State of Turkey also undertakes that the lands of the eastern part of the province of Zohaub, i.e., all the mountainous lands of it, with the valley of Kerind, shall be abandoned to the State of Persia. And the State of Persia firmly undertakes to give up all manner of claim in regard to the town and province of Sulaymauneyya, and not at any time to meddle or interfere in any way with the right of sovereignty which the State of Turkey possesses in the said province. And the State of Turkey also firmly undertakes that the town and seaport of Mohammerah, and the island El Khizr, and the anchorage place, and also the lands of the eastern bank, i.e., of the left side of the Shauttu-l-Arab, which are in the possession of tribes acknowledgedly attached (subjected) to Persia, shall be in possession of the State of Persia, in full sovereignty. And besides this, Persian ships shall have the right to navigate the said river in full liberty, from the place where it flows into the sea. as far as the point of junction of the frontiers of the two parties. Article 3. The two contracting parties undertake that by this treaty, all other territorial claims being abandoned, engineers and commissioners shall be appointed without delay on either part, so that they may draw the frontier between the two States in conformity with the foregoing article. Article 4. The two parties have agreed that commissioners shall be appointed on both sides without delay, to judge and decide in an equitable manner the questions of damages which have happened to both sides since the acceptance of the friendly suggestions of the two great mediating States that were written and communicated in the month of Jamauzyu-'l-evval, 1261 ; and also of the pasturage dues from the year when they fell into arrears. Article 5. The State of Turkey promises to make the fugitive Persian princes live at Broosa,. and not to give permission for them to be absent from thence, or for them to- correspond secretly with Persia. And it is agreed on the part of the two exalted States that all other fugitives shall be surrendered in accordance with the former treaty of Erzeroum. Article 6. Persian merchants shall pay the customs duties on their objects of commerce^, either in money or in kind, according to their current price at the time, in the manner65 prescribed by that article of the treaty of Erzeroum, concluded in 1238/ lf which relates to commerce; and no sum shall be demanded more than the amount mentioned in that treaty. Article 7. The State of Turkey promises that according to former treaties it will accord the necessary privileges to Persian pilgrims, so that they may be able to visit in safety and in freedom from any sort of molestation, the sacred places situated in the dominions of the Turkish State. It also promises that, in the view to strengthen and corroborate the ties of friendship and unity which it is necessary should exist between the two Mussulman States and between the subjects of both it will take the most proper steps, so that, in like manner as Persian pilgrims are in the enjoyment of all privileges in the dominions of the Ottoman State, the other Persian subjects also may participate in those privileges; and so that, whether in their commerce or whether in other matters, they may be protected from all kinds of oppression, molestation or disrespect. And besides this, the state of Turkey accepts the consuls who may be appointed on the part of the State of Persia for the benefit of commerce and protection of Persian subjects and merchants, in all places of the Turkish dominions where they may be necessary, excepting Mekka the respected, and Medeena the illuminated. And it promises that all privileges which are befitting the office and commission of the said consuls, and which are observed in respect of the consuls of other friendly States, shall be observed towards the said consuls. And the State of Persia also undertakes to reciprocate in the fullest manner in respect to the consuls who may be appointed on the part of the Ottoman State to any place in the dominions of Persia that may be necessary, and in respect to the subjects and merchants of the Turkish State who may frequent the Persian dominions. Article 8. The two exalted Mussulman States agree that, in order to prevent, repress and restrain the robbery and depredations of the tribes that inhabit the frontiers, they will devise and put in execution the necessary measures; and in this view, they will station troops in the proper places. And the two exalted States undertake to do what is requisite in the case of any kind of trepass occurring within the territory of each other, such as robbery, plundering, or murder. And they have agreed that the tribes concerning whom there is a dispute and whose suzerain is not known shall, once for all, have the choice and election of the place where they will henceforward reside ; and the tribes whose subjection is known shall be forcibly returned to the territory of the State to which they belong. Article 9. All the articles and paragraphs of former treaties, especially of the treaty concluded at Erzeroum in 1238, &lt;i: ' which are not particularly charged or annulled by the present treaty, are renewed in all their force and validity the same as if they were inserted word for word in this document. And it is agreed between the two exalted States that in two months from the exchange of this treaty, or in less time, it shall be accepted and signed by the two States, and the ratifications exchanged.

THE conference, which in concert with the Kussian envoy, I held with the Grand Vizier and Aali Pasha at Batta Liman on the 21st instant, resulted, with respect to Mohammerah, in a promise on the part of the Turkish Ministers that our opinions and arguments should he fully suhmitted to the council, and, with respect to Kotur, Tamban, and other disputed points of the frontier not specified in the Treaty of Erzeroum, that no further attempt at occupation, unprovoked by any aggressive movement of the Persians, should be made under the Porte's authority until the commissioners had visited those parts of the line and taken the respective claims into consideration. The arguments used by M. Titow and myself in support of the line recommended by the mediating commissioners, as the fairest demarcation for Mohammerah and its neighbourhood, were principally derived from the true intent and wording ot the second article of the treaty, from the mutual interest of the parties when rightly understood, and from the useless, not to say mischievous, complications involved in the arrangement proposed under his instructions by Dervish Pasha. The Ottoman Ministers grounded their preference for that arrangement on the terms of the Porte's explanatory note accepted, as they reminded us, before the exchange of the ratifications, not only Lord Cowley and M. Oustinof, but also by the Persian plenipotentiary, who was here. They represented the note in question as containing certain conditions on which alone the Sultan had consented to ratify the Treaty of Erzeroum, and they persisted in giving to that part of the note which regards Mohammerah an interpretation calculated to bear them out in requiring the adoption of their commissioner's line. Though it does not appear that the Persian plenipotentiary had jmy express authority to accept the note, there is no denying that it was accepted by the British and Russian representatives, and that the terms of it, taken literally, imply a limitation which it is equally difficult to reject on clear grounds of right or to admit with any degree of satisfaction. If the Turkish line were established there would be three lines of frontier, running almost parallel to each other, from the sea to the llati'ar Canal—an absurdity which never could have been contemplated by those who sought to simpliiy the relations of Turkey with Persia and to diminish the chances of fresh collision between them. Such au arrangement also stands in contradistinction with that clause of the second article of the treaty which extends the future acknowledged territory of Persia to other portions of the eastern coast of the Shatt-el-Arab, besides those which are included in the island of Khizr and t.ie town of Mohammerah. In this equivocal and contradictory state of things it was not to be expected that the Turkish Ministers would give way at once, and it is doubtful whether they will be induced to give way at all without a reference to the mediating Courts. Care has been taken to divert them from any expectations which they may possibly entertain of undoing the treaty altogether and opening a door for the reconsideration of its territorial arrangements. They have been told that a difference of opinion as to one clause of a ratified treaty can hardly be allowed to vitiate the whole body of the instrument, however the disputed point may be shown to be a just object of discussion and of better defined settlement; that the note appealed to by them, being of an explanatory character, could not be supposed to change the very nature of the treaty, in one of its essential parts, and to render its execution incompatible with the terms of the original stipulations ; or, if such had been the purpose of those who framed it, that at least so extraordinary and unexpected an intention should have been frankly declared and unequivocally expressed. In reply to a joint application from the Russian envoy and myself, it was stated to-day by Aali Pasha that the council had not yet had time to deliberate on the subject of the conlerence, and the Sultan's approaching absence from his capital will come in aid of His Majesty's personal disinclination to accept our inter pretation of the treaty, and probably contribute to postpone a final decision of the question. * This refers to the Explanatory Note of April 26, 1847, addressed to the Porte by the Mediating Representatives at Constantinople, giving explanations and assurances relative to certain stipulations of the Treaty of Erzeroum.67 Under these circumstances, I venture to submit the expediency of your Lordship opening a direct communication with the Court of St. Petersburg}! as to the real meaning and fair interpretation of the explanatory notes, in so far as they relate to the line of demarcation near Mohammerah. A distinct knowledge of the view adopted in common by the two Courts would best enable their representatives here to deal successfully with the point at issue, and to brina; the two parties immediately concerned into a more practicable state of mind with respect to the whole frontier. My Russian colleague agrees with me in this matter, and without the intervention of higher authority, I see much reason to apprehend an indefinite, and perhaps unpro ductive, duration of the frontier commissions and their costly operations. I have, &amp;c. STRATFORD CANNING.68 APPENDIX (H). Sir S. Canning', No. 82, April 2, 1845. (Sent to St. Petersburg-h, in No. 28, May 6,1845.) Sir S. Canning, No. 222, September 17, 1845.

THE commissioners appointed by the Turkish and Persian Governments to settle, under the mediation of British and Russian commissioners, the line of boundary between Turkey and Persia, as contemplated by the Treaty of Erzeroum have, at the very outset of their proceedings, so decidedly differed as to the intent and effect of that instrument and of the notes exchanged previously to its signature and ratification with reference to the southern portion of the boundary, that there seems every probability of its being necessary for the Governments of England and Russia to pronounce an opinion on the matters on which the parties more immediately interested in the settlement are at issue. Your Lordship is aware that in the year 1845, when it became evident that the respective plenipotentiaries at Erzeroum could not, even with the assistance of the commissioners of the mediating Powers, come to any agreement, the represen tatives of England and Russia at Constantinople drew up and submitted to the Porte and to the Persian Government a scheme of arrangement in nine articles, and in the second of these articles it was said, in regard to the matter now more immediately under discussion, ' that the Porte would consent to leave Persia in possession of the island on which Mohammerah is situated, and of as much of the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab as was actually occupied at that time by tribes admitted to be dependent on Persia, including the free enjoyment of the navigation of the river from its mouth to the point where the respective frontiers touch each other.' The Shatt-el-Arab, or the Arab River, is the name given to the united waters of the Tigris and Euphrates between Korna and the Persian Gulf. In the observations which I have now to make I leave out all reference to what passed at Tehran in regard to these articles, inasmuch as the question which is now to be dealt with is purely a Turkish one. The Porte at first objected that Mohammerah and the neighbouring districts had heretofore been Turkish territory, but had been wrongfully seized upon by Persia in 1841. Eventually, however, the Porte agreed to the article respecting Mohammerah, with the understanding that the concession was not to affect the Porte's right of property to the river, the course of which was still to belong wholly and exclusively to the Porte, which only granted freedom of passage to Persian vessels ; and, in order to secure the Porte's right, it was required that no fortifications should be raised on any part of the river banks remaining in the possession of Persia. The commissioners of the mediating Powers having, however, found it impossible, to bring the respective plenipotentiaries to agree to the terms sent from Constantinople, drew up a draft of treaty in which they sought, as far as possible, to reconcile the differences between the two parties. That draft, as regards the point now in discussion, stipulated that ' the Ottoman Government formally engaged that the town and port of Mohammerah, the island of Khizr, and the anchorage, and likewise the lands on the east bank, that is, on the left bank of the Sliatt-el-Arab, which are in the possession of tribes admitted to be dependent on Persia, should remain in the possession of the Persian Government in full sovereignty. Moreover, Persian vessels should have the right of freely navigating the Shatt-el-Arab, from its mouth to the point where the frontiers of the two parties should touch each other.' Eurthermore, ' the two contracting parties, having by the present renounced their other territorial claims, engage immediately to appoint commissioners and engineers, who may lay down the boundary between the two States, according to the preceding article.' But before this draft, drawn up by the mediating commissioners, came under discussion, the Porte alleged that it had just discovered that Mohammerah was wholly situated on the mainland, and that the town opposite to it on the island of Khizr bore another name ; and therefore it refused to cede that island. sThe Porte, however, did not persist in tliis objection ; hut, as difficulties were Lord Cowley, still raised to the signature of the treaty, the Ministers of the mediating Powers at 19 Constantinople suggested that the treaty might be signed, and that the Turkish (Sent'to plenipotentiary should present to the Persian plenijwtentiary, at the time of signing, St. Petersburgh a note stating that the Porte would require certain modifications of the treaty to he in No - assented to by Persia previously to the exchange of ratifications. Hut the note which Januar ^ 12 ' 1 * t7# the Porte was disposed to present in conformity with this suggestion not being satisfactory, the British and Russian Ministers suggested that the scruples of the February 3,184v Porte might be removed if the mediating plenipotentiaries were to record their own (Sent to opinion as to the interpretation to be given to the article in question ; and they St. Petersburgh proposed that such interpretation should be that the anchorage of Mohammerah was March If'1847 ) opposite the town and within the llaffar Canal; and that the Porte, in ceding to Lord Cowley Persia the town, port, and anchorage of Mohammerah, did not cede any other No. 64, territories or ports in that quarter; and that, as regarded divided tribes, territories February 15, occupied bv one portion of a tribe were not to be claimed by Persia simplv on the 1847 - (^ent to • St Pptpr^mirirn plea that another portion of the same tribe was located on lands admitted to be i n Vo 46 Persian. And Lord Cowley subsequently explained that this limitation applied to March 8,'1847.) territories situated above Mohammerah. L or( j Cowley, No. 115, April 2, 1847. (Sent to St. Petersburgh in No. 87. May 4, 1847.) Eut as the Porte was not satisfied with this proposal, the British and llussian Lord Cowley Ministers went further, and stated that under no pretence could Persia claim lands No. 81,^ situated on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, nor lands belonging to Turkey on J^g^tto' 184 '* the left hank, even in the event of Persian tribes being established on the said left g t Petersburgh bank lands. in No. 65, April 3, 1847.; The assurances finally given by the two Ministers, on which the Porte consented Lord Cowley to allow its plenipotentiary to sign the treaty, and on the meaning of which the , 1 i &gt; 7' i847 question now under discussion depends, are contained in the note presented by them (Sentto ' to the Porte on the 26th April, 1847, a copy of which is contained in Lord Cowley's St. Petersburgh despatch No. 167. I transmit to you herewith a copy of that despatch for more m 116 ' convenient reference, and your Lordship w r ill perceive that those assurances were that ' ay 1847 -) the Porte did not cede to Persia any port or territory in that quarter besides the town and the port of Mohammerah, and the anchorage of Mohammerah opposite the town and witliin the llaffar Canal, and besides the island of Khizr; that the Persian Government could not pretend to any right of property either over the country situated on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, or over territory belonging to the Porte on the left bank, even if Persian tribes in whole or in part were established there. The treaty was accordingly signed at Erzeroum on the Slst May, 1847 ; but when Lord Cowley, the period arrived for exchanging the ratifications, the British and llussian Ministers 9 had great difficulty in persuading the Persian plenipotentiary to acquiesce in the (Sent to assurances which they had given as to the interpretation of the article in question; St. Petersburgh in and even when they had succeeded in doing so, they were met by fresh objections on 284^0 the part of the Porte, which were only removed by their formally repeating the J ^c ow 'i e r assurances given by them previously to the signature of the treaty. The ratifications were thereupon exchanged on the 21st March, 1848. Lord Cowley's despatch, of March 17, 1848. w r hich a copy is enclosed, contains an account of what passed with the Porte (Sent to immediately before the exchange of the ratifications. 1 also enclose copies of the jj 1 t '^ et g9 Sburgl1 2nd and 3rd articles of the Treaty of Erzeroum to 'which 1 have already referred. April'4,1848,) In Lord Cowley 's No. 109, November 3,1846» No copy of the treaty as actually signed was sent home. But the signed treaty is understood to have been identical, as far as its stipulations are concerned, with the nine articles drawn up in 1846 by the mediating commissioners at Erzeroum. Matters remained in this state until the beginning of this year, when the commis sioners of the contracting parties and those of the mediating Powers met together at Mohammerah in order to proceed to an exact settlement of the line of frontier which was to separate the possessions of the two Mahommedan Powers in that quarter. [2440 c—10] T70 Sir S. Canning - , Your Lordship will perceive from Sir Stratford Canning's despatches, of which hi T it ^ 11 '' c0 I^ es ai,e enclosed, that tlie commencement of the proceedings of the commissioners has not heen satisfactory, and that in all probability the mediating Powers will have to pronounce an opinion on the respective claims of the two parties in regard to the country in the neighbourhood of Mohammerab. tier Majesty's Government therefore think it expedient not to delay communicating with the Court of St. Petersburgh on this matter, in the hope that, if the views of the two Courts should coincide, the expression at Constantinople of their decided opinion on the matters in dispute may tend to an early settlement of these matters. The Turkish commissioner, as will be seen from the enclosed papers, interprets the explanatory note addressed to the Porte by the Ministers of England and llussia at Constantinople previously to the signature of the Treaty of Erzeroum as securing to the Porte all districts not specifially mentioned as ceded to Persia, and he maintains that the note precludes all discussion in regard to any other districts. But this is far from being the correct interpretation of the note. The note merely says that nothing is ceded by treaty beyond the points specified, but it does not fetter the action and ^ discretion of the boundary commission, or say that if in the course of the investiga tions set on foot by the commission it should appear that Persia is entitled to other districts the commission should nevertheless be precluded from assigning such districts to her. The note precludes all discussion in regard to Mohammerah, its port and anchorage, and the island of El Khizr, for those places, being absolutely ceded by the treaty and admitted to be so by the Porte, the boundary commission have no discretion to exercise in regard to them. But the note does not say that the boundary commissioners should not ascertain whether, in addition to the districts specifically ceded to Persia, there might not be other districts in the same neighbourhood to which Persia might make good her claim. On the contrary, the note, by admitting that • districts on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab belonging to Turkey should continue to belong to Turkey, even though occupied by entire Persian tribes or by parts of Persian tribes, clearly implies that there might be districts in that neighbourhood which would turn out on enquiry not to belong to Turkey. That such was the understanding of the British and Russian Ministers at Constantinople is evident from the words in red ink on the margin of their note of the 26th April, 1847, which your Lordship will sec by Lord Cowley's despatch No. 167 of the I7tli May that they proposed to insert, and which they only abstained from inserting in order to avoid reopening the whole subject with the Porte ; and on being, moreover, assured by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs that whatever portion of the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab might be declared by the future commission to belong to tribes appertaining to Persia would be secured to Persia. It is manifest from this that in seeking to limit the possessions of Persia in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah to the points specified by name in the note of the English and Russian Ministers, the Turkish boundary commissioner is attempting to give to that note an interpretation which it was never intended that it should bear. o Such being the case as regards the construction of the note of the 26th April, r- 1847, the pretensions of the two Mahommedan Powers in regard to the line of boundary by which their respective territories are to be separated appear to be as follows ; The Turkish commissioner, admitting that the island of Khizr is to belong to Persia, claims as the Turkish boundary a line considerably to the eastward of that island, which would then be separated on the east from the Turkish territory by the Bamishere Channel, in the same manner as it is separated on the west from the same territory by the Shatt-el-Arab. The ground of the Turkish claim is that the district in question is occupied by a tribe which originally emigrated from Nedjid, and obtained grants of lands from the Sultan. The Persian commissioner claims the whole country to the eastward of the Shatt- el-Arab from the point a little below Korna where the Kerkha Iliver (Jaab) flows into it, to the Persian Grulf; and he grounds his claim, first, on the fact that the sources of the Kerkha are in Persia; and secondly, on documents showing that for many years past the tribes occupying that country have been to a certain extent subject to Persia. You will find in the tracing enclosed in Sir Stratford Canning's No. 110, the lines marked as claimed by the respective Mahommedan commissioners, and also a third line recommended by the commissioners of the mediating Powers. With regard to the line claimed by the Turkish commissioner, it is to be observed that if the Porte contemplated setting up any claim to the territories lying to the eastward of the island of Khizr, it would in all probability have insisted upon somestipulation in regard to the Bamisliere Channel by which that island is separated from the districts claimed by the Turkish commissioner. The Porte took very great pains to record its assertion of sovereign rights over the entire waters of the Shatt-el-Arab, by which stream the western side of the island is bounded ; but it made no stipulation in regard to the stream which bounds the eastern bank. The possibility of such an inconvenient arrangement as that now contended for by the Turkish commissioner could not have been contemplated, for that arrangement would have interposed between the Persian island El Khizr and the continental frontier of Persia a narrow slip of country wholly separated from the rest of the Turkish dominions; or, if the territorial claim of Turkey in that quarter was to be admitted in its full extent, the effect of the arrangement would be to separate the town of Mohammerah and the island of El Khizr from the rest of the Persian dominions. On the other hand, the claim of the Persian commissioner to the extensive district between the Kerkha River and the Haffar Canal which rests on the fact that the Kerkha has its source in the Persian boundary, cannot be sustained on such a reason. The question therefore to be resolved seems to be: to which of the two countries, Turkey, or Persia, the tribes by which the district in dispute is occupied properly belong ; and on this point the Turkish and Persian commissioners are at variance. The mediating commissioners, without pronouncing an opinion on the last question, have proposed a line which they appear to consider best calculated to secure the essential interests of both parties. It is an object of considerable importance to Persia with a view to the prosperity of Mohammerah, that both banks of the Haffar Canal should belong to Persia. On the other hand, the Turkish Government are understood to consider it essential for the welfare of Bussorah on the west bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, and of Korna, that not only the channel but also both banks of that river above the Haffar Canal should belong wholly to Turkey. The mediating commissioners propose to provide for both these objects by running a line, which vv ill divide the territory in dispute in nearly equal parts. The line claimed by the Turkish commissioners, in its prolongation towards the north-west crosses the Karun River above the point where that river falls into the Haffar Canal, and that line is carried on to two points, apparently buildings, which are situated somewhat to the south of the town of Hawizah on the Kerkha lliver. The mediating commissioners propose that the boundary-line between the two countries should run up along the east bank of the Shatt-el-Arab for a short distance above the Haffar Canal until it reaches a small stream which falls into that river ; and that the line should from thence be drawn directly to the points reached, as above stated, by the Turkish line, and thence directly to the town of Hawizali. Thus everything to the west of the proposed line, and consequently the east bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, with the exception of a small portion of that bank which can be of no value to Turkey, would belong to Turkey, and everything to the east of that line and consequently the north bank of the Haffar Canal would belong to Persia. Her Majesty's Government conceive that if the two mediating Courts should be called upon to pronounce an opinion on the respective claims of the two Mahommedan Powers, they can do no better than recommend those Powers to adopt the line proposed by the British and Russian commissioners ; and I have to instruct your Lordship to communicate on these matters with the Russian Government, and to ascertain whether the opinion of that Government coincides with the opinion of Her Majesty's Government as stated in this despatch.
