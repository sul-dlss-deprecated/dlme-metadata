He outlines his education and how links made at the University of Sheffield in Britain led to an association with AUC, where he became a full-time faculty member in 1972, the only Engineer on faculty for some years. He describes the science program and department (which took various names) at AUC in the 1970s, its and facilities and equipment in the Science Building, and the role of Chairman Adli Bishay in introducing Materials Engineering which grew out of the Solid State Science program. Farag tells of the expansion of Engineering programs at AUC during the presidency of Richard Pedersen, inspired by the desire to attract male students in order to balance the ratio of female-male enrollment. He addresses the division of the Engineering department into departments according to specialized fields (like Mechanical Engineering and Construction Engineering), and the 1990s restructuring of AUC into three schools including the School of Science and Engineering, whose Deans Amr Abdel Hamid, Fadel Assabghy, and Medhat Haroun he appraises. The continuing education and industry consulting role of the Engineering and Science Services unit, which Farag directed, is covered, as is his own research in metallurgy. Farag details his role as AUC’s longest serving Vice Provost in the 1990s and 2000s, sketching out the position’s role with respect to faculty and student research, graduate studies, fellowships, the summer session, and projects like environmental awareness. Other leading administrators receive attention as well. Mahmoud Farag explains the origins and development of the University Senate, for which he served as Chair and Vice Chair for terms in the 1990s and 2000s, explaining its structure and functions. Relations between university administration and faculty are discussed, along with significant faculty issues like the efforts to address the unequal salary, benefits, and working conditions (like retirement age) through negotiations and legal action. Later matters like his role in developing the Faculty Handbook is mentioned as well, as is the impact of the new campus. Farag also speaks about his family’s multi-generational connection with AUC, including his wife and children’s attending as undergraduate and graduate students and later working for the university.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:type>oral histories</dc:type><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017; American University in Cairo.
