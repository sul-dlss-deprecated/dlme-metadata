Subject :— Additional pension to military officers holding high civil appoint ments. I am directed to refer to Mr. Eobinson’s letter No. F.-4I7S, dated the 28th June 1922, conveying the approval of the Secretary of State in Council to the recommendation of the Government of India that a military officer holding substantively a civil post in Government service qualifying for an additional pension should be allowed to count service in an appointment of corresponding rank and responsibility in foreign service as qualifying for that pension. The letter went on to suggest that, in view of the fact that con tinuous officiating service qualifies for an additional pension, the orders should be modified to make it clear that such an officer would qualify if he is likely to have held an officiating appointment in Government service. 2, The Government of India have carefully considered this suggestion, but, apart from, the fact that the grant of this concession would go beyond the provisions of the rule in Article 644, Civil Service Regulations, they have come to the conclusion that there are serious practical objections to adopting the proposal. It would in practice be very difficult, if not impossible, to decide in any particular case whether an absentee would have been appointed to officiate in qualifying post but for his absence on foreign service. A case in point which illustrates this difficulty is that of Lieut.-Colonel Kennion, C.I.E., which was dealt with in the letter from the Foreign and Political Department No. 375—1119-Est., dated the 1st February 1923. For the reasons stated the Government of India would prefer that effect should not be given to the suggestion made in Mr. Robinson’s letter. In the case of civil officers, how ever, they have decided to recommend (in the draft revised pension rules) that if an officer while officiating in a qualifying post is transferred to an appoint ment in foreign service or to a temporary post in Government service of corres ponding rank and responsibility, service in such a post should qualify, provided it is certified that but for the foreign service or temporary appointment he would have continued to officiate in the qualifying post. The Government of India consider it reasonable that the same concession should be extended to military officers in civil employment and I am to recommend that the Secretary of State may be moved to issue orders accordingly. * * * * * Exthact paras. 1 TO 3 OF letter from the India Office, No. F.-3596, dated the 6th September 1923. In reply to Mr. Macleod’s letter No. 971-0.S.R., dated the 14th June 1923. on the above subject, I am directed to inform von that the Secretary of State for India in Council sanctions the proposal in tiie lasfc part oj the second paragraph of that letter, that, if a military officer, while officiating in a qualifying' post, is transferred to an appointment of corresponding rank and responsibility in foreign service, the period of such foreign service should count towards an additional pension, provided that it is certified that but for the foreign service he would have continued to officiate in the qualifying jiost. 2. With regard- to the suggestion made in my letter of the 28th June 1922, that an officer transferred to foreign service, who would have been likely to have held a qualifying post in an officiating capacity, if he had not been so transferred, should be allowed to count the period of such foreign service as qualifying for an additional pension, I am to say that the Secretary of State in. / 7 A2 \ . t / Council, on reconsideration, agrees with the Government of India that, for the reasons stated in the letter under reply, such further relaxation of the rules is inadvisable. 3. It will be necessary in future that officers accepting foreign service should be given clearly to understand the possible effect of such acceptance upon their prospects of special additional pension and as no such warning has been given' to officers taking foreign service in the past, at any rate prior to the issue of .Resolution No. 1276-C.S.It, dated the 2^th December 1921, and the decision in paragraph 2 above may in consequence work harshly in individual cases, the Secretary of State will be willing, as occasion arises, to consider such cases on their merits when there is strong reason for thinking that but for the foreign service an additional pension would have been earned in the ordinary line. I am to add in this connection that the application of Lieutenant-Colonel Kennion, to which reference is made in Mr. Macleod’s ^ / letter, has been refused. &amp; * &amp; * * No. 2326-C.S.R.

RESOLUTION. \ In their Resolution No. 81-D., dated the 15th November 1919, the Government of India announced their intention to constitute a committee to deal with the pro posal made by the Indian Industrial Commission for the creation of an Indian Stores Department. The terms of reference and personnel of this Committee were announced in Resolution No. B.-506-11, dated the 5th December 1919. The Committee were directed to enquire and report on the measures required to enable Government Departments to obtain their requirejnents as far as possible in India, what central and local agencies should be constituted for the purchase and inspec tion of such requirements and what modifications of the Stores Purchase Rules would be required to give effect to their recommendations. This Committee submitted its report to the Government of India on the 19th July 1920. 2. The Committee were unable to agree m regard to the modifications which should be made in the Stores Purchase Rules and certain alternative recommenda tions were offered. After careful consideration of these alternatives the Govern ment of India arrived at certain provisional conclusions, which, together with a revised draft of the Stores Purchase Rules, were sent to the Provincial Govern ments for their consideration and advice. In the meantime the purchase of stores by Governors’ Provinces had ceased, under the reformed constitution, to be a central subject. It was accordingly made clear that the revised rules under consideration were intended for application only to the Government of India and to Provinces other than Governors’ Provinces. On receipt of the replies from the Local Govern ments the revision of the rules was further considered by a Committee of the Legis lature (the Railway Industries Committee) which had been appointed in pursuance of a Resolution adopted by the Legislative Assembly on the 2nd March 1922. The rules approved by this Committee were submitted to the Secretary of State for his approval. 3. The Secretary of State in Council has now approved the rules appended to this Resolution, which will henceforth regulate the purchase of stores by all De partments and officers of the Central Government and of the Local Governments and Administrations other than those of the Governors’ Provinces. The main features of the new rules consist in the assertion of a more definite preference for stores produced and manufactured, wholly or partly, in India, an important exten sion of the power to purchase imported stores and the introduction of a central purchasing agency in India, namely, the Indian Stores Department. This Department, as announced on the 10th December 1921, was created on a tem porary basis with effect from the 1st January 1922, on which date the Chief Con troller of Stores assumed charge of his duties and proceeded to formulate a detailed scheme of organisation. This scheme, after consideration by the Govern ment of India, was submitted to the Secretary of State who has now sanctioned the constitution of the Indian Stores Department on a permanent basis. 4. The revision of the Stores Purchase Rules and the establishment of the Indian Stores Department are the direct outcome of a policy which aims at the encouragement of the industries of the country without sacrificing economy, and the Government of India take this opportunity of impressing upon all Depart ments and officers purchasing stores the importance which they attach, not only to a strict adherence to the letter of the rules, but also to a loyal observance of4. # 0 ' / the policy underlying them, as stated in the preamble to the rules. The observ ance of this policy, coupled with utilisation to the fullest possible extent of the services of the Indian Stores Department, will, it is confidently anticipated, promote both the objects which the Government of India have in view, namely, encouragement of manufacture in India and economy in the purchase of Govern ment stores. / * Order. Ordered that this Resolution be communicated to all Local Govern ments and Administrations, the several Departments of the Government of India (including the Financial Adviser, Military Finance), the Private and Mili tary Secretaries to His Excellency the Viceroy, all Heads of Departments subor- dmate to this Department, the Auditor General and all Accountants General, the Comptroller of Assam, Deputy Accountant General, Central Revenues, Delhi, the Financial Adviser, Posts and Telegraphs, and the Audit Officer, Indian Stores Department. . Ordered also that the Resolution be communicated to the High Commis- 'Sioner for India and to Chambers of Commerce and that it be published in the Supplement to the Gazette of India for general information. A. IT. LEY, Secretary to the Government of India, $ % M26DIL~—SOO- 1 —1S-6-24—PlPiS ■a \ |RULES FOR THE SUPPLY OF ARTICLES FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICE PREAMBLE The policy of the Government of India is to make their purchases of stores for the public service in such a way as to encourage the industries of the country, so far as is consistent with economy and efficiency. In pursuance of this policy the following rules are prescribed, with the sanction of‘the Secretary of State, for the supply of articles for the public service. These rules, which are subject to any instructions regarding specific articles which have been or .may be made by the Government of India with the sanction of the Secretary of State from time to time {e.g., those relating to the supply of stationery and printing stores for the public service), supersede all previous orders which are not explicitly continued. The rules are applicable to the Government of India and to provinces other than Governors’ Provinces. RULE 1 .— Articles manufactured in India from Indian materials All articles which are produced in India in the form of raw material, or are manufactured in India from materials produced in India should, in preference to articles not manufactured in India or wholly or partly manufactured in India from imported materials, be purchased locally, provided that the quality is sufficiently good for the purpose, and the price reasonable. Note.- —Although a strict comparison of prices is not enjoined by this rule, it is essential in the interests of economy that the purchasing officer should take into consideration, so far as may be possible, the price at which articles of similar quality not manufactured or produced in India can be purchased at the time. RULE 2.—Articles manufactured in India from imported materials Articles wholly or partly manufactured in India from imported materials should also be purchased in India in preference to articles not manufactured in India, provided that the quality is sufficiently good and the price not unfavourable.

When the total value of the articles required is trifling it is generally desirable to pur chase them locally. (б) In the case of important construction works let out on contract, articles not manu factured in India required for the construction of such works may be supplied by the contracting firm subject to the following conditions :— (t) That the firm is approved by the Chief Controller of Stores, Indian Stores Department, and is included in the list of firms so approved (List I). (ii) That the materials are subject to the current specifications and tests pre scribed by the Government of India. (c) Plant and machinery and component parts thereof may be purchased from branches* established in India of manufacturing firms borne on the list of the Chief Control ler of Stores, Indian Stores Department (List II), provided that the following con ditions are observed :—- (i) That the purchase is made by the Chief Controller of Stores, Indian Stores Department, or by a highly qualified engineer directly responsible to the Government of India for the order so placed. (ii) That the plant and machinery are of standard patterns such as are ordinarily manufactured by the firm, and have actually been so manu factured. * Brandies may be field to cover approved technical agents of manufacturers who do not merely act as selling agents but are also in' a position to render the same kind of technical assistance in India as actual branches of the firms. H45DILRULE 5.—Special purchases in India In eases of emergency, or when inconvenience to the public service would be caused by wait ing to obtain an article from England through the India Store Department, London, or when owing to the greater promptitude of supply, an economy can be effected by purchasing in India articles which, under the foregoing rules, should be obtained through that Department, the pur chase may be made in India, subject to the limits prescribed in Rule 11, provided that the articles are in India at the time of order or are already on their way out. In such cases, if the value of the articles exceeds Rs. 1,500, the sanctioning officer should place on record the reasons which make the local purchase desirable. This record shall be available for the inspection of the Examiner of Accounts or the supervising officer, when required. RULE 6.—Inter-departmental purchases Nothing in the rules is to be deemed to prohibit the purchase of stores by one department or railway from another. RULE 7.—Method of cbtairirg- stores ret purchased in India All articles which, under the foregoing rules arp not to be bought in India, should ordi narily be obtained by indent on the India Store Department Londcn, except those the pur- { Hi ) That the branch firm entertains a staff of expert mechanics capable, when so required, of erecting and repairing the plant and machinery which it supplies. {iv) I hat the actual price of the articles (exclusive of any expenditure represent ing cost of erection) is as low as that at which articles of the same make can be supplied by the Store Department, London. (v) That wffien test or inspection of the plant or machinery during manu facture or before shipment is necessary or desirable arrangements are made for such test and inspection to be carried out by *' the India Store Department, London. Note L—It should clearly be rnderstood by indenting officers that this rule is subject to the preference which should be given under Rules 1 and 2 to articles of Indian manufacture. Note 2.—Application for inclusion in the lists mentioned in this rule should be made to the Chief Controller of Stores, Indian Stores Department, direct by the firm with a full statement of the reasons which in its opinion justify such inclusion. RULE 1.—Articles which should be purchased in India \ The following articles, whether manufactured or produced in India or not, should be purchased in India provided that they comply with the current specifications, are of the re quisite quality, and can be obtained at a not unfavourable price (a) Those of a perishable nature.

(x) Articles required for Viceregal residences in special and urgent cases. iVofe.—Payments for stores purchased under this rule should be made direct to the suppliers by the pur* chasing officers. RUIijS f.—Method of comparing prices In all cases in which the selection of source of sdftply depends upon comparison of prices the procedure to be adopted for such a comparison is as follows :— (i) A reference should be made to Home prices notified continually^ by the India Store Department, London, to the Chief Controller of Stores, Indian Stores Department, or as otherwise ascertained, and freight should be added at the current rates paid by the India Store Department, London, together with such charges for interest, insurance, and freight brokerage as may be declared from time to time by the Chief Controller of Stores.

McWATTERS, C.I.E., I.C.S., Sdtretary to the Government of India, To All PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS AND MINOR LOCAL GOV ERNMENTS. Subject :—Prompt disposal of applications for the payment of the General Provident Fund balances and the issue of pensions of officers who retire or go on leave pre paratory to retirement. Sir, I am directed to inform yon that cases have recently been brought to the notice of the Government of India where there has been considerable delay in the payment of balances in the General Provident Fund of subscribers who have retired, or have gone on leave preparatory to retirement. It is obvious that any delay in such pay ment is a serious matter often resulting in hardship and loss to the subscriber. The Auditor General has represented that the Audit Department is usually considered solely responsible for the delay, whereas as a matter of fact, delay is sometimes caused by the failure on the part of the Head of an office to give the audit office essential information. His remarks apply also to delay in the issue of pensions, which is often due to the neghgence on the part of the authorities whose business it is to prepare the pension papers. Steps have already been taken by him to reduce, as far as possible, delay in the audit offices, and he has suggested that similarly steps should be taken to impress on Heads of offices the necessity of giving to audit offices essential information relating to the General Provident Fund balances or the pen sion of an officer, as the case may be without any avoidable delay. 2. The Government of India are in full agreement with him that it is necessary for the executive authorities to co-operate with the audit officers, and they there fore suggest that, if the Governor mJJQiinGtHms or( J ers p e issued to Heads Of offices and Departments under the control oUhe Looal^overnmerU to the effect that applications for pensions and for payment of Provident Fund balances, should be disposed of with the greatest possible expedition and that in future disci plinary action will be taken against the officers concerned if it is found that delay has been caused by such applications not having been promptly dealt with.

MACLEOD, Esq., I.C.S., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, To ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (including MINOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS). Simla, ike 4th August 1924. Subject.— Foreign Service. Sir, I am directed to invite a reference to Mr. Juke’s letter No. 64-E.B. of the 27th January 1922, regarding the rates of contributions payable on account of pension and leave salary of Government servants in foreign service. 2. In paragraph 4 of the above letter it was stated that revised rates of contribu tions for services other than the Indian Civil Service were under consideration and, when calculated, will be brought into force with effect from the date of that letter. These calculations have now been made and the Government of India are pleased to fix, under Fundamental Rule 117, the following rates of contributions for other services :— When leave salary When leave salary is paid by Govt. is paid by the Foreign Employ er. For officers of all-India Services (other 30% 3/16ths. than the Indian Civil Service) and corresponding Central Services. For other officers in superior Service .. 25% l/6th. As stated in the letter referred to above, these rates will have effect from 27th January 1922. 3. Representations have been made to the Government of India that rates of contributions based on actual salary in foreign service lead to considerable anomalies especially in respect of officers transferred to foreign service out of India, in whose case contribution only for pension is recovered, since the pension of a Government servant rarely, if ever, depends upon the actual salary drawn by him from the foreign employer. The Government of India consider that there is a good deal of force in the above objection and they are considering the advisability of addressing the Secretary of State on the question of altering Fundamental Rule 116 and basing these contributions on the salary drawn by the officer in his substantive appointment under Government instead of the actual pay received by him from the foreign employer. Meanwhile to mitigate the anomalies resulting from the rule as it stands2 at present, which does not fix any maximum pay for the purpose of calculating these contributions, they have been pleased to decide that contributions should be calculated on actual pay in foreign service subject to tile following maxima . I. C. 8. and Military officers .. • • .. Rs. 3,000 per month. Officers of other all-India Services and CentralServices ' Rs. 2,500 per month.

Subject:- Procedure for verification of service. Sir,. . In order to minimise as far as possible delays in the issue of authority for payment of pensions s the Government of India have decided to adopt the following suggestions for modifications in the present procedure regarding the preparation and disposal of applications for pension:- (a) It will be permissible in future for officers taking leave preparatory to retirement to submit their formal application for pension on proceeding on leave if they specifically*declare that they propose to retire at. the end of their leav?*, and if '-he pro posed date of retirement is definitely known, AudU officers will verify the services whereever necessary and send their final report to the sanctioning authority who will sanction the pension as soon as may be after the date of retirement of the officer. (b) When an officer is appointed direct from the Army to an appointment from which he will ultimately retire cn a civil pen sion, his military service should be verified forthwith and the details be handed over to the Civil Audit and Accounts officer. (c) The immediate verification of such military service should also be made in the case of civil officers now in r he Service who have had previous military service, whether prior to taking up a civil appointment or during the Ireat War. I am to request that, (with the approval of His Excellency the Governor in Council), steps may be taken to bring the revised the Madras etc. Presidency. procedure into force in —— -- Bihar and Orissa etc. I have the honour to be, .

Subject :—Supply of locks for use in Government offices, etc. SlE, The supply of locks for use in currency and treasury offices and for certain other purposes has hitherto been entrusted to the Controller of Printing Stationery and Stamps and their issue regulated by Rule 64 of the Rules for the Supply and Use of Stationery Stores. The Government of India have now 1 decided to remove locks from the category of stationery stores and their purchase will, therefore, in future be governed by the Rules for the supply of Articles for the Public Service which' were promulgated with the Resolution in this Department, No. S.-217, dated the 6th May 1924. 2. As the result of enquiries and tests carried out by the Indian Stores Depart ment the Government of India are satisfied that locks are now manufactured in India which are of sufficiently good quality to warrant their use for nearly all pur poses and these can be obtained at considerably less expense than imported locks of similar quality. Certain standard makes of imported locks however still show a slight superiority in the matter of safety, and the Government of India have accordingly decided that in exceptional cases, e.g., in currency offices imported locks may for the present be used, but that as a general rule locally manufactured locks should be purchased in accordance with Rule 1 or Rule 2 oi the otores Purchase Rules. As the requirements of individual officers in respect of imported locks are usually small and the cost trifling such locks should ordinarily be purchased locally under Rule 3 (a) of the Stores Purchase Rules. The Stationery Office however at present holds stocks of imported padlocks and almirah locks and until these stocks are exhausted imported locks should not be purchased locally with out a reference to the Controller of Printing. In cases where it is found necessary to purchase an imported lock through the Indian Store Department, London, the reasons why an imported lock is considered essential should be stated m the indent.. I ''i 2 3 . Demands for locks of local manufacture should be consolidated as far as possible and annual indents sent to the Chief Controller of Stores, Indian Stores Department, during the month of December. Bach lock will be subjected to in spection and test before issue by the Indian Stores Department. Supplementary indents to meet emergent demands will, however, be received at any time during the year. As stocks of locally made padlocks (size 1|', 2', 2|,' 3' and 3|') are at present held by the Stationery Office all indents for locks of these sizes received by the Chief Controller of Stores will be passed on to the Controller of Printing, Stationery and Stamps for compliance until the latter’s stock is exhausted. 4 . These orders will have effect from the 1st April 1925 after which date except in the special cases referred to in the preceding paragraphs, the Controller of Printing, Stationery and Stamps will be unable to accept indents for locks and will also cease to be responsible for the safe custody of duplicate keys.

MACLEOD, Esq., I.C.S., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, To All LOCAL GOVERNMENTS and ADMINISTRATIONS. Simla, the 6th September 192i. Subject.- • • Appropnatim Audit in respect of Central Civil W orks expenditure . Sir, The attention of the Government of India has been drawn to the necessity of framing detailed working rules, as contemplated in clauses (/&gt;) and (c) of Article 202 of the Audit Code and clauses (b) and (c) of paragraph 115 of the Public Works Account Code, prescribing in what cases specific provision (out of the appropriation at the disposal of the Controlling authority for the Primary Unit concerned) is necessary for individual works and when such expenditure on a oroup of works of the same class may be lumped together for appropriation audit. This would, it is stated, enable audit offices to lay down the procedure to be ob served for purposes of auditing the orders of authorities competent to allot funds for individual estimates (Major works, Minor works, or Repairs). 2. The Government of India have accordingly considered the matter in so far as it relates to Central Civil Works expenditure, and have decided that speci fic appropriation is necessary only in the case of every ‘ Major Work ’. Lump sum appropriations may therefore be made for £ minor works ’, and £ Repairs the audit of expenditure against the appropriation for individual minor works, petty works and repairs being replaced by audit against the lump sum appropria tions for each minor head or for a group of works. The check against the specific appropriations made by Divisional Officers out of the lump sum placed at their disposal may be left ho Divisional Accounts as indicated in paragraph* 115 (c) of the Public Works Account Code. 3. I am to add that the Appropriation Reports for the last two years have disclosed beyond doubt that the existing system of depending on the audit Department to watch expenditure against appropriations makes it both difficult for heads of departments to exercise adequate control and offers them no incen tive to any control. I am therefore directed to enclose herewith a set of detailed rules for adoption towards securing adequate control of expenditure against, appropriation in so far as Central civil works are Concerned. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Sd.) A. MACLEOD, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.2 No. 4059-Ex.

By order, etc., (Sd.) SITAL SINGH, Assistant Secretary to the Government of India. L M1 oOFinD—12 -9- 24—3,350—GIFRULES. 1. The funds allotted under each primary unit of appropriation will be distributed by the Chief Engineer to the Superintending Engineers under him, retaining such amounts as £ reserve ’ under any unit, at his own disposal as he may consider neces sary. The funds allotted under the fol lowing units need not, however, be distri buted to the Superintending Engineers :— (1) Grants in aid, contributions and donations. (2) Establishment charges payable to other Governments departments, etc. (3) Loss by exchange. (4) Deduct English cost of Stores. (5) Pay of officers. The funds under each of the units Original Works (for Civil Works), and Works, and Extensions and Improvements (for Irriga tion works, etc.) should be divided into se condary units “ major works,” and “ minor works.' As regards major works the speci fied appropriation sanctioned for each work should also be intimated. 2. The Superintending Engineer should similarly distribute the funds placed at his disposal, among Divisional Officers Working under him, retaining such amounts as ‘ reserve ' at his own disposal as he may con sider necessary. The distribution of the funds under the units £ Original Works,’ Works and Extensions and Improvements should be made in the manner indicated in Rule 1. The appropriation for the primary unit “ Suspense ” should be distributed after sub dividing' it under secondary units, Stock, London Stores,^Miscellaneous, Public Works Advances and Purchases. 3. In regard to the secondary unit for Original major works, the Divisional Officer will be responsible that:— (i) No expenditure is incurred on any original major work without a specific appropriation for it, but in the case of unfinished works of previous years which are likely to be completed in the new year for Rs. 500 or less a specific appro priation is not necessary. (ii) The expenditure on each original major work is limited by the amount of the specific appropria tion sanctioned for it, and the excess expenditure over such ap propriation, unless the excess ex penditure is Rs. 500 or under, should be covered at once by sanc tion of additional appropriation. (Hi) The total expenditure on all original major works of the Division does not exceed the total of the appro priations for his division under the secondary unit “ major works.” 4. In regard to the secondary units for original minor works, and other primary and secondary units, the Divisional Officer is responsible that his expenditure is kept within the appropriations for each unit as placed at his disposal by the Superintending Engineer. 5. Immediately after submission of his monthly accounts to the Audit Officer, the Divisional Officer should submit monthly to the Superintending Engineer, a report in duplicate in the following form :— Original Works Civil Buildings. (p Appropriations at beginning of montb. (ii) Appropriations during month. (in) Total of (i) and (it) (iv) Withdrawals during month (v) Net appropriations at the end of month. (vi) Expenditure during the month. (vii) Expenditure to end of pre vious month. (viii) Total expenditure of the year. (ix) Unspent balance .. Major Works. Minor Works. And so on other units of appropriations. . — f. i• x'aS V 6. (a) In respect of units, the expenditure on which is incorporated in the monthly accounts of the Division, the Divisional Offi cer should see that the expenditure as shown in the above report agrees with that shown in his monthly accounts. (6) In regard to transactions which do not enter the monthly accounts but are paid at the Treasury on bills on account of pay and allowances of Government servants (and also contingencies and supplies of ser vices if these are paid on bills at the Trea sury), the following instructions should be observed. (1) Whenever a bill is presented for pay ment at the Treasury it should be marked clearly with the complete account classifica tion, (vide paragraph 504 of the Public Works Account Code) as well as the primary and secondary units of appropriation. (2) An account should be kept for each primary and secondary unit of appropriation, in which will be entered every bill cashed at the Treasury under its appropriate unit. At the close of each month the expenditure against each unit should be totalled and the figures included in the report referred to in Rule 5. 7. On receipt of the monthly reports (vide Rule 5), the Superintending Engineer should examine them to see that the Divisional Officers have not exceeded the appropria tions placed at their disposal. He should then prepare a report for his whole circle in order to review the progress of expenditure against the appropriation placed at his disposal by the Chief Engineer. Note.— In preparing the Circle report* the Superintending Engineer should also include the expenditure on bills drawn by himself at the Treasury. For this purpose he will also keep a register similar to that kept by Divisional Officers for such bills, vide Rule 6 (5). 8 . The circle^report should be sent in duplicate to the audit officer supported by Divisional reports in original and an abstract of He Superintending Engineer’s register referred to in the Note to Rule 7. The Audit Officer will check the Circle report with his own accounts and return one copy together with Divisional reports, etc., after making corrections in it and indicating the reasons for corrections. The second copies of all Circle reports will be sent by the Audit Officer to the Chief Engineeer, together with the following :— (i) A list of bills drawn by the Chief Engineer himself as booked in Audit Officer’s accounts. \l(ii) A monthly report showing the total expenditure of the year, under each primary unit of appropriation, for the whole province. These reports will enable the Chief En gineer to review the progress of the expendi ture for each circle as well as for the whole province. 9. The Audit Officer will, in addition to the check of expenditure against grants and primary units of appropriation as prescribed in Article 202(a) of the Audit Code, exer cise the following checks on behalf of the Executive :•—- (i) See that the instructions in Rule 3 in regard to the expenditure on major works have been observed, (ii) See that the expenditure on original minor works, repairs suspense, and Refunds of Revenue as incurred in each Division is kept within the lump sum appropriation placed at the disposal of the Divisional Officer. These checks by the Audit Officer will not relieve the Superintending Engineers from the checks prescribed for them in Rule 7.

Simla, the 10th November 1924. A • To All LOCAL GOVERNMENTS and ADMINISTRATIONS. Policy and 'procedure in regard to the forfeiture of military pensions and other military awards. Sir, It has been represented to the Government of India that it is desirable that they should reaffirm, and in certain respects amplify, the orders which have been issued from time to time in regard to the continuance or forfei ture of pensions, rewards, etc., earned by military service, the holders of which become involved in some form of seditious agitation or disloyalty towards Government. The Government of India understand that there is a feeling among serving soldiers in particular that the intentions of Gov ernment in regard to this matter should be made clear and should he con sistently carried out; and the Governor,-General in Council is accordingly pleased to issue the following instructions on the subject. 2 . The liability to forfeit pension may be incurred without a pensioner having been actually convicted by a criminal court of an offence connoting disaffection or disloyalty towards Government: in other cases the liability arises directly from such conviction. In order to determine the practice and procedure which should be followed, it is necessary to deal with these two classes of cases separately, and it is also necessary to make it clear that there must be a difference of treatment in regard to (i) pensions, jangi inams, and other forms of recurring money payments, and (ii) grants of land given as rewards for military service. 3 . Cases in which the liability to forfeit pension is incurred ivithout the pensioner having been actually convicted of an offence connoting disaffec tion or disloyalty towards 'Government .—The Government of India have decided that the following principles shall apply (i) (ii) (iii) rL Vr-246 Subject to the investigation of each case on its merits, seditious and violent agitation against the administration falls within the meaning of the expression “grave misconduct” for the purposes of paragraph 569, Pay and Allowance Regulations, Part II, as amended by A. I. (I.) No. 901 of 1924, and agita tion in the form of passive resistance to the orders of Govern ment or advocacy of such a course may, in certain circum stances, to be examined, amount to “grave misconduct 0 ; active support or advocacy of the movement of non-co-operation also constitutes “grave misconduct” for the purposes of the rule cited above, each case being treated on its merits; a warning should be given to the pensioner before penal action is resorted to, but the local Government or Administration may, at their discretion, dispense with such a warning. 12 It must be recognised, however, t£iat these pensioners are not amenable 'to the Indian Army Act, and the military authorities will not take any action unless and until a local Government or Administration makes a definite recommendation to the District Commander, to the effect that a pensioner should forfeit his pension. On receipt of such a recommendation, the question of withdrawing the pension under the provisions of paragraph 569, Pay and Allowance Regulations, Part II, as amended by A. I. (I.), No. 901 of 1924, will be considered by the District Commander to whom authority is hereby granted— (i) to order the forfeiture of pension in all such cases, and (ii) to restore the pension from such date as is considered suitable in cases where the local Government or Administration and the District Commander are satisfied, on a guarantee of future good behaviour having been given, that this ought to be done. The Government of India desire to emphasise that these instructions are intended to be acted upon, and that it is particularly desirable in present circumstances that adequate use should be made of them. It will be observed that under these instructions action has to be initiated by the civil authorities; and the civil authorities may feel less reluctance in taking action if they realise that it is not the intention that a pension withdrawn under these orders should in all cases be permanently forfeited. 4. Cases in which the liability to forfeit pension arises out of the pen sioner having been convicted of some offence connoting disaffection or dis loyalty towards Government .—In these cases the military pensioner will automatically forfeit his pension from the date of his arrest, and the forfei ture of pension will continue during the period of imprisonment and there after, unless and until orders specifically directing the restoration of the pension are obtained. It will rest with the pensioner, if he desires to have his pension restored, to make an application to the civil authorities, and if the local Government or Administration, on a consideration of all the circumstances of the case, consider that leniency would be justified and make a recommendation to that effect, the District Commander, on receipt of the recommendation and a written assurance from the pensioner of future loyalty and good behaviour, may in his discretion direct the restoration of the pension from such date as he may determine, but in no case from a date prior to the pensioner’s release from prison. 5. The orders contained in the two preceding paragraphs will apply to every form of military pension, except family pensions, and will extend also to assignments of land revenue and cash jagirs granted as rewards for military service. 6 . Cases in which the reward to be forfeited is a grant of land, held subject to a condition of loyalty .—Instructions on this subject also have already been issued, vide the Government of India, Revenue and Agricul ture Department, Circular letter No. 254-C., dated the 22nd February 1918, addressed to all Local Governments (copy attached). The further practice and procedure laid down in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this letter will, with one important exception, apply generally to these cases also. The exception to be made arises out of the fact that it is hardly practicable to prescribe absolutely that a grant of land shall be automatically forfeited upon arrest or conviction. In cases where a land grant is affected, there fore, and the grant, under the terms on which it is held, is liable to forfei ture, the following shall be the procedure :— {a) Action will be initiated by the civil authorities. (b) It will be appropriate in certain cases, before penal action is taken, to give the grantee a severe warning and an oppor tunity to mend his ways. But the Local Government or Administration acting in consultation with the District Com mander will be at liberty to resume without warning in such cases as they think merit the extreme penalty.* 3 (c) The concurrence of the District Commander should be obtained in all cases before the grant is withdrawn. (d) As in the case of pensions, and on the same terms and condi tions it will be open to the Local Government or Adminis tration, in consultation with the District Commander, to restore the grant in cases where it has been forfeited tem porarily. The Government of India desire in the case of land grants also, which are liable to forfeiture, that full use should be made of the powers conferred, now and at all times. It would be intolerable from every point of view, and particularly in the regard of loyal serving soldiers and loyal military pensioners that individuals who hold gifts of land, on the condition of loyal behaviour and active support of Government, should continue to enjoy those gifts when they have obviously ceased to honour the condition in the letter or in the spirit. 7. I am to request that, with the permission of ? 13 'Esceiircey the Governor m Council, the widest publicity may be given to these instructions : the Government of India themselves will take steps to ensure that they are made known to serving soldiers through the medium of the Fauji Akhbar and other channels. 8 .

In the case of tenant grants ((such as those under peasant conditions in the Punjab Canal Colonies)), carrying a right to acquire proprietary rights, the condition will lapse when those rights have been acquired. The terms of the grant should be so drawn as to ensure that the Local Government or Administration will, in all cases, be the final authority to decide whether this condition has been violated, and, that a breach of the condition will involve resumption, either temporary or per manent, of the grant or such portion thereof as the Local Government or Administration may determine.

Dated Simla, the 21st April 1925. OFFICE MEMORANDUM. Subject.— Purchase of publications in the United Kingdom. The attention of the Government of India has been drawn to the high prices, at present paid by departments and attached and subordinate offices for publica tions issued in Europe. In the United Kingdom, departments are not permitted to purchase any publications except through His Majesty’s Stationery Office, which is able to purchase at wholesale prices. The Government of India do not consider that such a procedure would at present be practicable for the require ments of their offices, but arrangements have now been made which should result in considerable economies in the purchase of books, etc., published in Europe. 2 . Under these new arrangements, departments and attached and subordi nate offices are authorised to indent direct on the High Commissioner for India for any books, etc., published in Europe which they require. Under the terms that have been arranged the High Commissioner will be able to purchase at pub lishers’ (wholesale) prices plus a commission at the rate of 7|%. It is expected that under the new arrangements publications, orders for which are received by one mail, will be despatched by the High Commissioner by the following mail. 3 . The system is at present voluntary and departments and offices may con tinue to purchase publications directly either in England or in India. At the same time, it should be pointed out that on no other system will it be possible to pur chase books at rates as favourable as those now offered. In the case of many books the saving will amount to about 20% on the retail prices charged by a book seller in England, and a much larger saving will be effected on the prices generally current in India. Further, if the new system (in which local Governments are being invited to participate) is extensively followed, it may be possible for the High Commissioner to obtain even more favourable rates in future years. At a time when departments are finding it necessary to pay for a number of publica tions which they have obtained free in the past, the opportunity of economy which is now offered should be especially welcome. 4. The new system will come into force on the 1st July 1925, i.e., the High: Commissioner will be able to secure concession rates for all orders reaching him. by the mail leaving India on the 13th June 1925, or by any subsequent mail. In submitting indents to the High Commissioner, departments and attached and sub ordinate offices should use the form appended to this memorandum. The form should be sent in duplicate, and the head of account to which the cost will ulti mately be debited should be clearly stated in the appropriate place. The cost of purchases made, including packing and postage or freight, will be reported quarterly by the High Commissioner to the Accountant General, Central Revenues, who will debit the contingent grants of the indenting offices with the value of their purchases.d, d, 2 5. Tie system will not apply to offic'al publications of His Majesty’s Govern ment, and such publications, if ordered through the High Commissioner, should not be entered on the form prescribed ior this scheme.

DEPARTMENT OE INDUSTRIES AND LABOUR. STORES. To All DEPARTMENTS of the GOVERNMENT of INDIA, INCLUDING ElNANCIAL ADVISER, MILITARY ElNANCE. The undersigned is directed to refer to the provisions of Rule 8 of the revised Rules for the supply of articles for the public service, which were promulgated with Resolution No. S.-217, dated the 6th May 1924, of the Department of Industries and Labour. This rule prescribes the procedure which should be adopted in cases in which the selection of the source of supply depends upon a comparison of prices, and lays down, inter alia, that reference should be made to the Home prices as notified continually by the India Store Department, London, to the Chief Controller of Stores, Indian Stores Depart ment, or as otherwise ascertained, and that freight should be added at the current rate paid by the India Store Department, London, together with such charges as interest, insurance and freight brokerage as may be declared from time to time by the Chief Controller of Stores. 2 . The question of the procedure which should be adopted by the Indian Stores Department in communicating the Home prices of stores and the charges which should be added thereto for the purpose of a comparison of prices has been under consideration, and the undersigned is now to communicate the decision which has been arrived at. 3. In paragraph 6 of the letter from the Board of Industries and Muni tions No. S.-4, dated the 6th August 1920, the Government of India signified their intention of deferring the revival of the Rate List, the publication of which was suspended during the war, and stated that they had arranged instead for the Director-General, India Store Department, London, to supply them with copies of all contracts placed by him for stores. It was originally intended to publish the information obtainable from these contracts in 'a form which would be accessible to indentors, but the idea was abandoned owing to the impending organisation of the Indian Stores Department. Copies of the contracts placed by the India Store Department, London, are regularly received by the Chief Controller of Stores; but as a result of the experience which has been gained during the past three years the Chief Controller of Stores has advised the Government of India that the publication of the information obtainable from this source in the form of a Rate List would not form a satis factory basis for the comparison of Home and Indian prices owing chiefly to market fluctuations. Moreover, there is the danger that, consequent on the delay which must inevitably occur before publication, the list might give incorrect and misleading information resulting in orders not being placed in the most economical and otherwise suitable markets. Acting on this advice the Government of India have decided that no attempt should be made to revi ve the publication of the Rate List, at least for the present; but in order Delhi, the 8th December 1925. Office Memorandum.2 to assist indenting departments and officers in effecting a comparison of prices it has been arranged that the Chief Controller of Stores will, on receipt of specific requests, furnish such information as may be available in his office in regard to Home prices. 4. The charges on account of interest, insurance, freight brokerage and freight which should be added to the Home prices for purposes of comparison will be communicated periodically by the Chief Controller of Stores, Indian Stores Department, to all indenting authorities. 5. In comparing prices with a view to determining whether any particular article should be purchased in India the Home prices, which may have been received, should be converted at a fixed rate of Is. 6d to the rupee.

Septembfir 1920 . 2 , as the paragraph stands at present, this F ower aost be exercised by the High COTijsisaioner himself and cannot in any circuxcisranees be delegated to a member ^&gt;f his staff. ®ne High Ooffimissloner considers this position to be uasatisfactor He nas pointed out that, apart from the lact that he may at a. time be temporarily incapicitated by illness to such an extent that signature of documents would not be feasible, he may oita.. oe called away ifom his olilfcice on official business (e.g., may be deputed to Geneva to attend a meeting of the League Rations) and that serious inconvenience might be caused oy the delay necessary in the progress of signature.it is further pointed cut that when tne High Commissioner is absent on a holiday, his movements may be *&gt;o uncertain that it would not ce possible bo send important documents to him witn any decree oi security oi finding him. He accordingly suggests that Section 29 a of the Government of India Act (Section 35 oi the Act oi lyly) on which t^e order in Council is cased should be so amended as to enable the Secretary to the high Commissioner to sign contracts and agreements on hie behali in h s temporary absence under auen limitations -s to circumstan.ces as it might be considered desireable to impose, in tms connection he has fo warded a note by the legal adviser oi the India Oilice dealing with the legal aspect of the matter. In this note, a ccpy oi which is enclosed, Sir m .3V&lt; .D. Chamier expresses the opinion that it would ue j-ossible by amendment of the Order in Council to authorise the hign Commissioner to delegate to persons on his establishmentestablishment the tower to make and sign contract* ol the kinds mentioned in section 29(5) of the aovernment of India Act, but that it would be necessary to amend the ^ct if it is desired that the high Commissionar should have tower to delegate to other teraons the power to make and sign contracts oi all kinds within the scope of his duties • 3 * ‘The Government of India are aware that the existing x osItion under which the High Jommissloner must himself exercise such tower as he has to make and sign contracts on behalf of the Secretary of State in Council, had led to practical difficulties in the past and they tnerefore agree with Fir ktul Chatterjee that an amendment of the Act in the direction suggested is desireable• At tne seme time tney are of opinion tiiatjthe matter is not of sufficient importance to justify special legislation, and that any amendment ol Section 29 a of the Act that may be considered necessary should be made when the Act next comes revision as a result of the recommendations of the Reforms ^npuiry Committee. Fir upward Chamier has, however, ee already stated, advised that it would be possible to authorise a delegation of the High Commissioner’s tower in respect of contracts of the kinds specified in section 29 ^ 5 ) of the Act, and if this were done it would go a considerable way towards meeting the difficultfeaa experienced by the high Commissioner• 1 am accordingly tc request tnat the Secretary of State for India in Council may be moved to amplify clause 0 of tne Order in Council so as to provide that, subject to such rules and restrictions ns tue High Coutissioner with the approval of the Governor-General in Council mey pf^ cribe » contracts in the cas^s men^ione^ m Section 29j5) of the Act may be made and signed on behalf oi the secretary of State in Council by any person upon the per manent establishment of the High commissioner who is duly empowered by the High Commissioner in this behalf.^ote by the ^egal Adviser, India Office, I think it would be possible by amendment of the Order in Council under S.29-A 0 f the Government of India Act to Authorise the High commissioner to delegate to persons on his establishment power to make and sign contracts of the kinds mentioned in ^.29(5} of the Act. But I understand that ?/hat the High Commis sioner wo.nts is power to delegate to other persons the power to make and sign contracts of all.kinds within the scope of his du ties, Such a power cannot, in my opinion, be obtdined except by an amendment of the A 0 t. The Bill which is intended to give effect to certain proposals of the Bee Commission has already been drafted and passed by the Cabinet and it is now too late to suggest that 3.29A should be amended by this Bill. It seems probable, however, that the recommendations of the M u ddiman Committee will necessitate some father amendment of the Act, and if so we might take the opportunity of suggesting an amend ment of I n any case the Apt is certain to be amended again before long. Meanwhile the High Commissioner might discuss v.he form of suitable amendment with the Government of India. Hd/- ii.M.D. Chamier. 27th February 1925.
