He sees no objection to the suggestion that it should be explained to the French Ambassador that it would be contrary to established practice to accord official recognition toM. Sudreau's jurisdiction in any other part of India, though it would appear to be the case that in the Commission of the previous French Consul other districts in India besi es Bombay were mentioned. \/ith regard to the intention of the French Government to include Muscat in M. Sudreau’s district, the Under .Secretary of State would suggest that in the reply ^ to the French Ambassador it should be stated that it is presumed that reference has been or will be made to His/- — -His Highness the Sultan of Muscat in this connection; and it mirht ho added, if the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs sees no objection, that His Majesty’s Government are pre'ared to refer the matter to His Highness on behalf of the French Government if they should so desire. The Uncer Secretary of State presumes that the Colonial Office are being consulted regarding the inclusion of Aden within Mr. Sudreau 1 s district. In^a Office, Ipth March,1939(T 2103/2103/385) The Under-oecretary of State for Foreign Affairs presents his compliments to the Under-Secretary of State for India and is directed hy the Secretary of State to transmit herewith a copy of a note from the French ambassador at this Court? stating that Monsieur rierre Sudreau has been appointed French Consul at Bombay and applying for the issue of His lAjesty’s Exequatur to that gentleman to enable him to act in the above capacity. 2.

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 28th June, 1939. Your Excellency, With reference to your note No. 78 of the 13th February I have the honour to return herewith the Commission appointing M. Pierre Sudreau to be Consul of France at Bombay, together with The King’s Exequatur empowering him to act in that capacity. 2. I venture to explain that His Majesty’s Exequatur refers to Bombay only, since it is not the practice of the Government of India to recognise the jurisdiction of a foreign consular officer outside the port at which he resides* 3. As regards M. Sudreau’s jurisdiction in the ” 1 ’etablissernent d’Aden”, I have the honour to state that Aden is no longer under the jurisdiction of the Government of India, but is now a colony administered under the authority of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. In these circumstances I venture to enquire whether it is still desired that M. Sudreau should exercise consular jurisdiction in A en, and, if so, whether his jurisdiction will include both the Colony and protectorate. 4. In connexion with the mention of Muscat contained in the Commission appointing M. Sudreau, I have the honour to state that it is assumed that reference has been or will be made to His Highness the Sultan in this connexion. His/ His Excellency Monsieur Charles Corbin, G.C. .0., etc., etc., etc.,His Majesty’s Government are prepared to refer the matter to His Highness on 'behalf of your Government should they so desire. I have the honour to he, with the highest consideration, Your Excellency’s obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) (Sdj R.DUNBAR.- i</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00035c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/149</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00035c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/149</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File [VI B/4] Foreign Interests: French Consulate at Bushire'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1939/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-05-29T22:21:56</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (8 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 10; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
