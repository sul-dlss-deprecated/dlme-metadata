ISUORANDUM: - I wish to report that, owing to certain information received, and personally noticed, I duly discharged Clerk Fazal Husseyn yesterday from the. Bahrein Government service, as from the 2^rd July, 19^8. The facts are these: I have noticed signs oi} discontent in “uhe Force recently; and it has been constantly ^ - reported to me by my Superinten dent, but I always hoped that it would clear up, that the cause of this discontent was the Clerk. I spoke to him on more than one occasion since I have been here, add warned him that if there was the slightest, thing ag&amp;ximt him in the shape of causing n fitna n , amongst the men, it would mean instant dismissal. I told him this purposely, as I considered it only fair, knowing that he had, more or less, been mixed up in the clique, which ended in the shooting of the Subadar and the Havildar. From evidence I heard, he deliberately caused trouble when the leave question was brought up, secretly advising the men not to /accept the terms granted by the Commandant, but that ix’ they made sufficient row, they would get what they wanted. This led, as I now discover, to one or two men being put in the guard-room, following his advice. .another very blatant case was that of a certain Persian Havildar, whom I had cause to reduce. He now informs me that he was called into the’ raerly^ Room, and advised by the Cler^not to accept this sort of treatment f'f kk e . a man .’ kf?

As the man was discharged by the Commandant of of Police for deliberately stirring up trouble and H Filina* amongst the sepoys, and sent away from Bahrain, I would hum bly request that he be ordered away at- once; if possible be put back on the up-mail. I am convinced that he has returned simply and solely to make trou ble, also that it had been arranged that jnp should do so, and I consider that it is most probable he did not pay his own fare. He is staying with Dr. Atta Ulla.. ^ ^ Qt »©.&amp;•’ ' of 1928. Political /vgeny, Bahrain . Tiic i6th October 1928. To The Advisor, Bahrtin Stato, Bahroin. M^orandum. Tht subjoct matttr of your Ho. 358/16 is under consideration. Am I right in understanding that the charge against the individual is that he advised the sepoys not to accept the ruling of the Corrmiandant of Police regarding leave? Are there other charges against him? CpS* U_ Political Agent, Bahrein. . ! i &lt;j *' ‘ | 1I granted Pazl Hussain an interview this morning in which ht rsqusstsd my intervention in the matter 01 his summary dismissal from the Bahrein Police Force. He alleged that his dismissal was due solely to personal enmity ef the Superintendent Lieutenant, Sultan Ahmad Chewdri whese word Captain Parke had accepted without question. He then proceeded te make several charges of corruption as a Police officer against Lieutenant Sultan Ahmed, which I told him was a matter for Captain Parke’s investigation. His previous letter on this subject had already been referred to Captain Parke. On questioning Fazl Hussain the latter admitted that Lieut. Chowdri had made a written report against him, which was read out to him by Captain i J arke, ef inciting dis** -affeotionin the Police Force. He also heard the evidence ef Ali Hassan and Asadulla who witnessed against him. He complains however that the Commandant Captain Parke attached undue weight to the Superintendent’s evidence and mmfcx none at all to his rejoinder. I explained to Fazl Hussain that he was serving in a semi-military force. In all such bodies the Subodar ( ( here the Superintendent ) was the Commandant’s confiden- -tial adviser, on whom great trust was reposed. If the Commandant did not trust his Subedar or listen to his roports there was an end to discipline. The Commandant was responsible for his force, and bofore taking action in a case such as tne present he would naturally verify the facts placed befere him by the Subedar. In the present case, from Fazl Hussein’s ewn statement, Captain Parke had before issuing orders confront- -ed Fazl Hussein with his accuser and heard the evidence. An effioer who is Commandant ef a Force must be presumed to be in a position to weigh up the evidence correctly. In very,rare cases would putside interference inin tht internal adxniniotration of a Forco bo dosirablo and ouch inttforonco should comt, if at all, from tht Commandant's immodlato suporior who is Shoikh Hamad. If gross injustice wort done to a British Subject the Political Agent would try to got such injustice put right. A British Subject serving in a Police Force could not however claim the right of trial in the Agent's Court for an offence against Police discipline ior which he had boon dismissed. In the present case as a proper enquiry appeared to have been hold I did not consider myself called upon to inteforo. Fazl Hussein said that in those circumstances he would leave Bahrein by the first boat. I mentioned that this was the very thing the Commandant desired as he had applied to me for Fazl Hussein's deportation. On reconsideration Fazl Hussain said he would like to appeal to Sheikh Hamad. I replied that this was a cure. X gh.uldS** 1 Hu.s.in th.n said he was watched by the Police oh the instigation of Lieut. Sultan Ahmad. I advised him not to go near the Polioi and if he intended to stay in Bahrein to live in Muharraq out of the way. He will make an appeal to Sheikh Hamad in the meantime will live at Muharraq, Ho proposes ( presumably if his appeal to Sheikh Hamad fails ) to leave Bahrein next week, in the down steamer which is to be diverted to Bahrein to take Haji Mahomed Ali Zainal. Ho orders of deportation has been passed. ^ j-,. A point I have omitted to mention is that fc Fazl Hussain states that a fortnight before his dismissal, seeing the Superintendent'a enmity, he had asked to resign, but his offer had not been accepted. He asks why, when this course had been taken, he was forced to leave so soon after ana in spite of the weak health of his wife.jbn I have no information about this # but I said that I prooumod that in th# interim some ovidonct of his intrigues to stir up dissenssion in the force had come tt hand. As regards the delicate health of his wife I was informed that a medical certificate had been obtained from the American lady Doctor to show that she was fit to travel. advised Itezl Hussein te leave Bahrein and had endorsed his passport.

The Commandant of Police informs me that one of the charges a^ains t him was that he did his best to persuade the men not to accept his ruling etc, regarding leave. He also, when a cer tain Havildar was reduced, called him into the Office and told him to be brave like a Baluch, and not to accept such treatment. He was also continually telling the sepoys that no proper arrange ment was being made by the Government for married families and also to try and get cash in lieu of rations, and also on the question of promotion. On de parture I might mention his cash was all in order.?, The Agency, Bahrein 26th Oofc.19^ .1 Roferanoe your demi-official letter dated the 25th October 192 q.
